He was appointed a brigadier general on July 6, 1864, to rank from July 2, 1864, the date of U.S. Senate confirmation of his promotion.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 722 Early life and education Hardin was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, the son of John J. Hardin. He was a family friend and prot√©g√© of Abraham Lincoln. Although widely reported that it was at the Hardin family home that Lincoln first met his wife, Mary Todd, this is most likely false. Lincoln and his future wife probably met in Springfield. Hardin graduated from West Point in the Class of 1859, and was an aide to Robert E. Lee in the hanging of John Brown soon after. Military service Hardin served as a colonel in the 12th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment. He lost his left arm in the Mine Run Campaign, but continued serving in the army. He was mustered out of the volunteer service in June 1864 but returned to active duty on July 2 with an appointment to brigadier general. General Hardin commanded a division in the XXII Corps during the battle of Fort Stevens. Martin Davis Mardin House in Lake Forest, Illinois After retiring in December 1870, he became a lawyer in Chicago, and had a winter home in St. Augustine, Florida. His second wife, Amelia McLaughlin (1863‚Äì1939) was the sister-in-law of Irene Castle, the well-known dancer. Hardin spent his last years in the famous \\"Union Generals' House\\" at 20 Valencia Street in St. Augustine, Florida (saved from a proposed demolition by Flagler College in the 1980s thru the concerted action of local history lovers). Hardin was one of the last surviving Civil War generals of either side at the time of his death in 1923. He is buried, with his wife, at the U.S. National Cemetery in St. Augustine. His widow honored him by building a chapel (complete with a statue of St. Martin) on the grounds of the Mission of Nombre de Dios in St. Augustine.

As is the case with many people of color who lived in America during the 1800s, there exists very little information about her. Most of what is known about her comes from the introduction of her book, written by Reverend James W. C. Pennington, pastor of the Colored Congregational Church of Hartford and the first black man to attend classes at Yale University. Pennington was an important influence on Plato's educator. In her book's introduction, Pennington wrote of Plato: \\"My authoress is a colored lady, a member of my church, of pleasing piety and modest worth.\\" Teacher and writer Plato taught at the Free African Schools, housed in the Zion Methodist Episcopal Church from 1840Smith, Katharine Capshaw. \\"Ann Plato.\\" American Women Prose Writers: 1820-1870, edited by Amy E. Hudock and Katharine Rodier, Gale, 2001. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 239. Literature Resource Center, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/H1200010133/LitRC until 1847. She was a member of the Talcott Street Congregational Church in Hartford. In 1841, at the age of 16, she published her only known book, entitled Essays: Including Biographies and Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose and Poetry. The essays reflected the New England Puritan values of her environment. Topics included \\"Benevolence,\\" \\"Education,\\" \\"Employment,\\" and \\"Religion.\\" The essays stressed both the importance of education and of leading a pious, industrious life. The book also contained some poetry and biographies of departed female friends and acquaintances. Some critics from later generations found Plato's essays and poetry to be overly moralizing as well as routine and lacking in originality. Many of them also derided her for not mentioning the issue of slavery in America, as did some of her near contemporaries including Frances Harper and Charlotte Forten Grimke. Plato's one reference to slavery in her book concerns its abolition in the West Indies in 1838 (perhaps a reference to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 valid throughout the British Empire).Ann Plato, \\"To The First of August\\", reprinted in Margaret Busby (ed.), Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, pp. 75‚Äì76. She does, however, emphasize the equality of people, regardless of race, a few times in the Essays. Nothing is known about Plato's life after her book was published in 1841. Furthermore, the year of her death cannot be found.Wright 737. However, Ron Welburn in his book Hartford's Ann Plato and the Native Borders of Identity (SUNY Press, 2015) records that in the 1870 Iowa Federal census a 46-year-old woman called \\"Miss Plato\\" who may well be Ann Plato is listed as residing in Decorah Township, Winneshiek County, Iowa.Welburn, Ron, Hartford's Ann Plato and the Native Borders of Identity, SUNY Press, 2015, p. 125. Legacy In 1988, Oxford University Press released The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers with Professor Henry Louis Gates as the general editor of the series. Plato's book was reprinted as a part of this collection. Trinity College, Connecticut, established the Ann Plato Fellowship in her honor in 1988.Welburn (2015), Hartford's Ann Plato and the Native Borders of Identity, Chapter 1, p. 17. Quotes \\"A good education is that which prepares us for our future sphere of action and makes us contented with that situation in life in which God, in his infinite mercy, has seen fit to place us, to be perfectly resigned to our lot in life, whatever it may be.\\" ‚ÄìAnn Plato \\"A good education is another name for happiness\\" ‚ÄìAnn Plato \\"Although there are many nations, and many stations in life, yet he watches over us, he has given us immortal souls. Some have white complexions, some are red, like our wandering natives, others have sable or olive complexions. But God hath made of one blood all who dwell upon the face of the earth.\\" ‚ÄìAnn Plato, \\"Benevolence,\\" Essays: Including Biographies and Miscellaneous Pieces of Prose and Poetry Published work Essays: Including Biographies and Miscellaneous Pieces of Prose and Poetry (1841), contains four biographical compositions, 16 very short essays, and 20 poems and is sectioned off into three parts: \\"Prose,\\" \\"Biographies,\\" and \\"Poetry.\\" This collection reflects Plato's work and interest in the antebellum schoolroom as well as her relationship to religion. The prose section reflects Plato‚Äôs ideas about education and how Christian principals are infused in the classroom. Plato uses the eulogies of four Black girls, Louisa Sebury, Julia Ann Pell, Eliza Loomis Sherman, and Elizabeth Low, who most likely died of consumption, to present a template on how to live a \\"legible\\" righteous life. Finally, her poetry section is a collection of poetry that further considers life, death, and suffering.Georgini, Sara, \\"A Woman's Work: Ann Plato's Republic\\", Society for U.S. Intellectual History, December 21, 2016.

It is about north of Assisi. It is home to well- preserved 14th-century walls, and was the birthplace of Saint Maria Goretti; it is also the site of a Halloween festival held every October. It is a wine country (its Verdicchio is famous). Corinaldo is included in the association \\"I borghi pi√π belli d'Italia\\" and in 2007 it was voted \\"Italy's prettiest village\\" Miliario di Corinaldo. Main sights The walls The imposing walls preserve all the typical elements of the Medieval period such as murder holes, embrasures, loopholes, moats and towers telling the tales of glorious battles of the past. Following the external path of the walls, which is about 800 meters long, it is possible to visit 3 of the 4 towers near the castle entrances. The three entrances are: Porta Nova (New Gate), Porta del Mercato (Market Gate), Porta San Giovanni (Saint John's Gate). The polenta well Located at the center of La Piaggia (a suggestive staircase of 104 steps) there is a well. The actual well was rebuilt in the 80s in the same place where the original one was, built in the 15th century by the tyrant of Corinaldo, Antonello Accattabriga. The original one was used as aqueduct and destroyed at the end of the 19th century, because it was no longer necessary. The well is linked with a traditional folk story: a long time ago, a man was climbing La Piaggia staircase street with a sack of corn flour on his shoulders. Once he reached the well, he put the sack on the well's edge to catch his breath but unfortunately the sack tumbled down into it. The poor man tried to save it and went down into the well himself. Starting from this point of the story, the oral tradition over time created many different versions of what happened next: the people watching the scene started to say that he was eating polenta in the well, while someone else thought that the polenta needed a few sausages to be more tasteful and others went to the well. This rumor was probably fostered by the military enemies of Corinaldo to discredit the citizens. The fig cannon The fig cannon is another popular folk tradition belonging to Corinaldo's citizens: the rivalry between Corinaldo and Montenovo (old name for Ostra Vetere) had been long-standing. Since the citizens of Corinaldo had long desired to win this rivalry, they had an ingenious idea. They used a trunk of fig, and they made a cannon out of this wood, which is very fragile. The day they shot with the cannon, many people crowded onto the city walls to witness the fall of Montenovo. The seven most courageous citizen held the cannon while the commander lit the fuse. There was a tremendous boom and when the smoke faded away, the seven were fallen dead. The commander then exclaimed: \\"If seven people died here, just imagine how many died in Montenovo!\\". A reconstruction of the fig cannon can be visited inside the town hall building. Museums The town art museum is the Pinacoteca Claudio Ridolfi.

The town is located on the bank of the Beas River.  Climate and geographical location  Sujanpur has an average elevation of 562 metres (1,844 feet). The climate varies with hot summers and cold winters. The winter is especially severe on the banks of Beas River. The temperature varies from 38 ¬∞C in the summer, to almost zero degrees in the winter. In the winter there are often areas of low-lying clouds. Sujanpur is connected by road to all of the major towns in Himachal Pradesh, as well as the rest of the country. It's neighboring towns include Hamirpur, Palampur, Joginder Nagar, and Dharamshala. There are many bus connections to surrounding towns and cities. The nearest railway station is in Maranda. About three decades ago, the Sainik School was opened in the town. Demographics As per the 2011 Census of India, the Tira Sujanpur Municipal Council had a population of 7,943, of which 4,262 were male, and 3,681 were female. The literacy rate of Tira Sujanpur City was 91.73%, higher than the state average of 82.80%.  Overview  Sujanpur was previously inhabited by Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch, the king of Kangra. He constructed his palaces, temples, and courts on top of a hill called Tira, hence the name of the town is Sujanpur Tira. In the middle of the town, there is one square kilometer of green ground, which in the Pahari language is called the 'Chaugan'. Part of this ground is occupied by the Sanik School. The notable Holi fair also takes place on this ground, and lasts for almost three weeks during the month of March. Based on the caste system, each side of the 'Chaugan' is occupied by Brahmins, Vaishyas, Kashtriyas, and Shudras, but the concept is now waning. The town has two temples constructed by the king, which are Bansiwala (for Lord Krishna) on one side of the ground, and for Narvdeshwar on the other side. One of the temples at Tira was destroyed during the 1905 Kangra earthquake, as were the most of the palace buildings. The Archaeological Department has tried to restore some of the monuments. Some of the Kangra paintings were collected by commissioner E.N. Mangatrai, and some were returned to the museum in Chandigarh.  History of Tira Sujanpur  Sujanpur bears its name from the Hindi word Sajjanpur, which means \\"the town of honest and gentle people\\". The name was later changed to Sujanpur Tira when Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch moved his capital from Kangra to here, and constructed large buildings at the top of the hill ‚ÄòTira‚Äô. In 1972 Kangra was merged with the newly founded state of Himachal Pradesh. Later Kangra was split into three districts, and Sujanpur became part of the Hamirpur District. Inner courtyard of Katoch Palace-Fort overlooking Sujanpur Tira Entrance and outer wall, Katoch Palace-Fort. March 2019 Overlooking the town of Sujanpur, Abhay Chand Katoch‚Äîthe ruler‚Äîbuilt a fortified palace at the top of the hill called Tira in 1748 AD. When Kangra was taken over by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after the Jwalamukhi treaty with Sansar Chand, Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch moved his capital to Sujanpur on the left bank of the River Beas. Hence the name 'Tira' was attached to its original name of Sujanpur. This king was respected during his regime, because Sujanpur was flourishing in many aspects. He also created a one square kilometer green ground in the midst of the town (called Chaugan) which was used to train soldiers for war. Part of the ground is now occupied by Sanik School. Maharaja Sansar Chand died in 1824 in Alampur, just across Sujanpur Tira on the opposite side of Beas River. The Fort of Sujanpur Tira still belongs to the descendents of Maharaja Sansar Chand. Adjoining the Fort is the Maharaja Sansar Chandra Museum run by the Royal Family of Kangra.  Occupations of the people  The major occupations in the town are business, agriculture, and services. Many of the young people want to serve in the army. At present, the total population is close to 10,000 and over 93% of the populace is literate. The population of men to women is almost 50:50. Only 10% of the population is below 6 years old. This town has produced educated people occupying positions at the national and international levels in many professions. Many of these have received national and international recognition. At one time it was the most well-educated town in the old Kangra district, but due to development needs, Kangra was divided into many districts.  Temples of Sujanpur Tira  Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch built large palaces and temples. Some of the temples are places of great architecture and Kangra paintings. The Murlimanohar (now known as Bansiwala) temple stands on the left side of the ground, and the Narvadeshwar temple dedicated to Shiva-Parvti overlooks the bank of the Beas river. Another temple is Thakardwara, and there are also other smaller temples. The temples were built in 1790 AD and 1823 AD by Maharani Pransani Devi-Suketi, Rani of Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch. Maharaja Sansar Chand also built the Chamunda Devi temple within the premises of the palace, which still exists. The people of Sujanpur are very religious-minded.  Monumental ruins  Ruins of interior of Katoch Palace-Fort. March 2019 Palaces, courts and temples built by Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch still exist in Tira, though some have been destroyed by the passage of time and natural disasters. Baradari (the daily court) still stands and can be seen from the 'Chaugan' ground. He also built a huge water reservoir to take care of the needs of daily water for the town. A lot of work was done by M. S. Randhawa who tried to restore parts of the heritage. He also started collecting Kangra paintings. Many of them are available in the Chandigrah Museum and with the last living king of Lambagraon.  Devastation by 1905 earthquake  The earthquake of 1905 almost destroyed all the palaces and temples of the valley. 90% of the houses were destroyed. Festivals The Holi festival is celebrated, and has become a tradition for 3‚Äì4 weeks during the month of March. Other festivals like Diwali, Lohri, Shivratri, Janamashtami Baisakhi, Basant Panchami, and many others are also celebrated by the people in this town.

Background  Lane was born in Connecticut. He left school early and took a job delivering groceries, where he met a doctor who helped him take a course at Boston's Sloyd Training College. He began to teach in a high school that his sponsor later opened. Lane had two children by his first wife, Cora Barney, and three by his second wife. They also adopted a daughter. He died in Paris after having been deported from England for failing to maintain his alien registration. His family remained in England.  Career  Lane started his teaching career at Peters High School in Southborough, Massachusetts. In the spring of 1907 he settled in the Detroit area. He held several teaching positions in the city and became the director of the Solvay Guild. He first introduced his notion of self-government at the Jewish settlement house called Hannah Schloss Memorial Building. Lane was appointed superintendent of the Boys Home and d'Arcambal Association in Farmington Hills, where he worked with youths who had run afoul of the law. The program that Lane developed at the school was geared toward building the boys' self- respect and self-reliance and toward giving them an opportunity to practice self-government. In 1912 he was invited to go to England where he founded the Little Commonwealth school in Dorset and greatly influenced A. S. Neill, the founder of Summerhill School. In December 1917 two sixteen-year-old girls under Lane's care accused him of sexually assaulting them, one of whom reported her allegations to the police; the subsequent Home Office inquiry, which demanded Lane's removal as superintendent, led to the closure of the school in the summer of 1918, though Lane was never subject to criminal investigation. Bazeley, Elsie Theodora (1928), Homer Lane and the Little Commonwealth, pages 194-202.Historian Lucy Delap identifies the allegations made against Homer Lane as the 'first well-documented case of alleged institutional child sexual abuse in Britain.'Delap, Lucy. ‚ÄúDisgusting Details Which Are Best Forgotten‚Äù: Disclosures of Child Sexual Abuse in Twentieth- Century Britain. Journal of British Studies, 1 June 2014, Volume 57 Issue 1, pages 79-107. Influence  Homer Lane's Little Commonwealth influenced the foundation of Alexander S. Neill's Summerhill School. Lane's foremost disciple was his patient, Alexander S. Neill. Neill claimed that he was particularly impressed by Lane's ideas about an experimental self-governing community for young delinquents since it eliminates the negative effects of authority and breeds altruism among those who participate. Neill began Summerhill, a school that offered a unique approach to education based on the idea that children are good and - if left alone - are capable of self-governing, motivating, and directing their lives and learning. which became exceptionally well known after American publisher Harold Hart published Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing in 1960. The book sold 200,000 copies. Hart had never before published a trade book, being a publisher of children's books and having been advised strongly against publishing Neill's. He was given moral support by a number of alternative educators in the United States, but took on the project on his own. The American school, Summerlane, in North Branch, New York, was explicitly named for Summerhill and Homer Lane. It began in 1963 in North Carolina but was burned by racists and moved to Mileses, New York, then settled near North Branch, in farmland near the hamlet of Roscoe, New York, off Highway 17.

Located at the intersection of Greenpoint and Manhattan Avenues in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, it is served by the G train at all times.  History  Greenpoint Avenue opened as part of the first phase of the IND Crosstown Line, with service south to Nassau Avenue in Brooklyn. This station opened on August 19, 1933. As part of the 2015-2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program, elevators will be added to the platforms and street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Construction would start in September 2018 and be completed by December 2020.https://new.mta.info/document/15766 pdf page 16 There would be three elevators: one from the mezzanine to street level, on the eastern side of Manhattan Avenue north of Greenpoint Avenue, and one to each platform. The project is expected to cost $23.4 million. Station layout Station stairs This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have a green trim line on a black border and name tablets reading \\"GREENPOINT AVE.\\" in white sans serif font on a black background and green border. Directly below the trim line are name captions reading \\"GREENPT\\" in white lettering on a black background, shortened due to the length of \\"GREENPOINT.\\" Directional signs are below the name tablets and green columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black name plate in white lettering. This is the northernmost station on the IND Crosstown Line in Brooklyn. To the north, the line goes under Newtown Creek into Long Island City, Queens. Exits The station's full-time entrance/exit is at the south end, which is the more heavily used of the station's two entry-exit points. The large mezzanine above the platforms and tracks has three staircases to each side with directional mosaics reading \\"Brooklyn\\" and \\"L. I. City and Jamaica\\" and green columns. Outside the turnstile bank, there is a token booth and three staircases going up to all corners of Manhattan and Greenpoint Avenues except the northeast one. G trains, which are about half the length of the platform, stop near the south end of the station. Both platforms have an unstaffed, same-level fare control area at their north ends. Each side has one exit-only turnstile, two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles, and one staircase going up to the south side of India Street and Manhattan Avenue.

It is a part of Western Province of the Solomon Islands. It covers approximately . Tetepare supports pristine lowland rainforest and a rich inshore marine area. The meaning of the name is uncertain; it most probably means \\"wild pig\\" or \\"fighting boar\\" because the island was (and to some degree still is) famous for these animals among inhabitants of the region.Molia (2000), Read & Moseby (2006) The local residents were apparently once a distinct ethnic group; a Tetepare language and unique traditions are attested, but information is fragmentary. Like their neighbors on Rendova Island and New Georgia, they appear to have been swidden agriculturalist, and to have occasionally practiced headhunting. But the island was abandoned in the mid-19th century, with the locals dispersing to New Georgia, Roviana Lagoon, Vona Vona Lagoon, Nggatokae and Ranongga.Molia (2000) At the western tip, a coconut plantation was established in 1907‚Äì1918, but this declined since World War II and all maintenance ceased after 1990. Secondary forest is now reclaiming this area. Ecology The island has been recognized for its conservation significance and archaeological values. A total of 230 bird species, 24 reptile, four frog and 13 mammal species have been recorded on Tetepare including rare and endemic bird and bat species. Scientists are still discovering new species on Tetepare. In recent years, researchers discovered three new species of fish, one new fish genera and one potential new fish family in Tetepare's freshwater rivers.http://www.tetepare.org Three species of marine turtles, including the critically endangered leatherback and hawksbill and the endangered green, nest on Tetepare's volcanic black sand beaches. Sharks, dolphins, crocodiles and an extraordinary diversity of fish species make the island's reefs their home. The coral reefs of the region support one of the highest diversities of fish and coral in the world, second only to Raja Ampat in Indonesia. The island sports a rich herpetofauna, but geckos are somewhat less diverse. It supports three species of sea turtles, namely green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, and hawksbill sea turtle. The latter two are considered critically endangered species, and the former two are known to nest on Tetepare. The Solomon Islands skink which occurs here is one of the largest living skinks, if not the very largest. The mangrove monitor and the pacific ground boa are also not rare here; these three scleroglossan reptiles are becoming rare in the Solomon Islands. The highly unusual green green-blooded skink can be seen on the beaches. In late 2004, entomologist Charles DeRoller conducted the first survey of the lepidoptera occurring on Tetepare. The range of 43 previously identified lepidoptera was expanded to include Tetepare. Most butterfly species on Tetepare are common to the New Georgia and/or Shortlands groups of islands. However, a new subspecies of butterfly, argyronmpha rubianensis masolo, was described. The birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera victoria) was for the first time confirmed to exist on Tetepare, though the dead specimen was in such a state of decay that the specific subspecies could not be determined. Birds are also plentiful, despite the presence of cats. Possibly the pigs and maybe the cats have extirpated certain ground birds, as indicated by the paucity of Gallicolumba doves and rails. The majestic Sanford's sea-eagle is plentiful, and among rarer birds, the beach thick-knee, crested cuckoo-dove and Kolombangara monarch are found. Nicobar pigeons and island imperial-pigeons use Tetepare as a foraging ground, crossing over from their roosts in neighboring mangrove swamps in huge numbers. The only known endemic taxon on Tetepare is the plentiful Tetepare white-eye (Zosterops tetiparius tetiparius), a subspecies of the dark-eyed white-eye. Most mammals on Tetepare are bats. Among these is Fardoulis' blossom-bat (only described in 1993) and a roundleaf bat that might be Maggie Taylor's roundleaf bat (described in 1981) or a new taxon. In addition, some flying foxes from Tetepare are hitherto unidentified; possibly the New Georgia monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex taki) is one of them. The island supports a population of wild pigs, which are an important food resource for people from neighboring Rendova Island, particularly during feasts. Local hunters help to regulate the pig population through frequent hunting trips to the island. At least one feral cat is known to exist on the island, but other invasive species like the cane toad have not reached the island.Read & Moseby (2006) Land \\"ownership\\" among the Tetepare people was of a customary caretaker nature. Their descendants are still recognized as the traditional landowners or overseers of Tetepare Island, and the island continues to be a place of spiritual and traditional significance in the region. In 2002 the Tetepare Descendants' Association was founded to coordinate the maintenance of the equilibrium between the island ecosystem and the exploitation of its resources by the growing human population of the Western Province, as well as the preservation of Tetepare as the home of their ancestors. A low-tech field station and ecolodge for ecotourism has been built.The last wild island , Kate Hennessy, G Magazine, April 2011 Tetepare Descendants' Association In 1995 Friends of Tetepare was formed from a group of customary landowners to prevent commercial logging on the island. In 2002, the Friends of Tetepare and TOLOA (Tetepare Traditional Landowners Association) came together to form the Tetepare Descendants' Association About the Tetepare Descendants' Association (TDA). Their aim was to conserve Tetepare for the benefit of all descendants and future generations. More than 3000 descendants have since joined the TDA, making it one of the largest land-owning organisations in the Solomon Islands.http://www.tetepare.orgOld Warden Uniforms Worn Again and Spirits of an Uninhabited Island: Tetepare, South Pacific, By Mike and Jeanine D'Antonio, 26/05/2007, National Park Warden Association The TDA is a registered Solomon Islands charitable organisation, with an office in the town of Munda, and a field station and ecolodge on Tetepare Island. The TDA has established a Marine Protected Area on Tetepare, which is a no-take zone. This is one of the largest contiguous Marine Protected Areas in the Solomon Islands. TDA rangers, marine monitors, seagrass monitors and turtle monitors work on the island to patrol and protect the MPA and the forest, and to monitor the health of the island's reefs, seagrass meadows and forests, and to tag turtles and protect and relocate turtle nests during the nesting season from September to April. With funding and support from the European Union, the TDA has created an ecolodge on Tetepare, which provides jobs for descendants from local villages and raises money to support the conservation program.http://www.tetepare.org The TDA also runs sustainable livelihoods programs for descendant communities and runs a scholarship program to help TDA members pay school fees for their children. The TDA has received support and funding from several international organisations and individuals including the European Union, World Wide Fund for Nature, Conservation International, Australian Volunteers International and NZ Aid.

Their name is derived from a staff they carried with them surmounted by a crucifix. There were several orders devoted to the Holy Cross, collectively known as Crosiers, that had some presence in England and there is much confusion to which specific order the friars belonged to. Earlier literature linked most of the Crutched Friars to the Italian Crosiers, but later it was proven that they were a branch of the Belgian Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross. The Crutched Friars were suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. England Their first appearance in England was at a synod of the Diocese of Rochester in 1244, when they presented documents from the Pope and asked to be allowed to settle in the country. They established eight or nine houses in England, the first being at either Colchester (according to Dugdale), or at Reigate (according to Reyner), founded in 1245. They settled in London in 1249, where they gave their name to the locality, near Tower Hill, still called Crutched Friars. Other houses were at Oxford; York; Great Welnetham (Suffolk); Barham (Cambridgeshire) (a cell to Great Welnetham); Wotten-under-Edge, Gloucestershire; Brackley, Northamptonshire; and Kildale, Yorkshire. The order was dissolved, along with other Catholic orders, by Henry VIII in 1539. Ireland The Fratres Cruciferi appeared in Ireland at some time before 1176 when they are first listed as being in possession of the Hospital of St. John without the New Gate in Dublin. It is likely that they based this hospital on the Hospital of St. John in Jerusalem. The founding of these hospitals gave care to both men and women from all religions. The Hospital (which became known in later centuries as Palmer's Hospital and had a capacity of 155 beds) had been founded by the Norse-Gael Ailred the Palmer and his wife some time prior to 1188 when Pope Clement III granted the Hospital certain privileges.Charles McNeill, The Hospital of St. John without the New Gate, Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquities of Ireland, 1925, No. 1 The Hospital occupied the site on Thomas Street, Dublin now occupied by the Augustinian Church of Saint Augustine and Saint John the Baptist now served by the [Mendicant] Order of St. Augustine (not to be confused with either the Augustinian Canons ‚Äì who had many foundations in Ireland, introduced by St. Laurence O'Toole as Archbishop of Dublin to, amongst other churches, Christ Church Dublin ‚Äì or the Fraters Cruciferi). The Register and Charters of the Hospital have survived in manuscript; they were published by the Irish Manuscripts Commission in 1937 (in the original Latin). The order owned several hospitals and priories in Ireland, including Palmerstown (which was owned by the Hospital of St John the Baptist without the Newgate in Dublin pictures, County Dublin (the town of Palmerstown is named after [Ailred de] Palmer named the founder of the hospital); Kilkenny West, County Westmeath; the Priory and Hospital of St. John the Baptist of Nenagh, County Tipperary; Rindoon, County Roscommon; King's Island, Limerick City; Ardee, County Louth; Castledermot, County Kildare; Athy, County Kildare; New Ross, County Wexford; St. John's Priory, Trim; and Dundalk, County Meath. The dissolution by Henry VIII of the Order in England in 1539 also applied in Ireland. George Dowdall, last head of the Irish order, was compensated by becoming Archbishop of Armagh.

It is famous for the Vedagiriswarar temple, a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. History Tirukazhukundram's name is derived from kazhughu, meaning eagle. At one time, two eagles soared above this Shiva hilltop temple every day at lunch time, and the priest at the temple gave them food as a ritual. According to legend, these eagles were not ordinary eagles, but two rishis whom a curse had transformed into birds. The legend also said that the eagles would stop coming to the temple during the Kali Yuga. The eagles have not been sighted in recent years, which is regarded as a sign that the Kali Yuga has begun. There is no Nandi on this hilltop temple of lord Shiva as it is believed that Nandi refused to step on this hill as it considered the whole of this hill as lord Shiva himself, hence stayed back on the ground level by the foothills. The prefix Tiru in Tirukazukundram means 'holy' or 'sacred' and is traditionally used in names of temple towns in all parts of Tamil Nadu. Demographics In the 2011 India census, Tirukalukundram had a population of 29,391. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%.

The first name refers to the land at the confluence, (trimakuta in Sanskrit (citation needed) at the confluence of the Kaveri, Kabini and Spatika Sarovara (a mythical lake or spring, also named Gupta Gamini). This is the place in South India where Kumbhamela is held every three years. It finds a mention in the Skanda Purana as one of the Trimakuta Kshetras (holy places at the confluence of three rivers). The word 'Narasipura' is the name of the town, which is derived from the famous Gunja Narasimhaswamy temple that is located on the right bank of the Kabini river. Considered as sacred as Prayag (confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati at Prayag ‚Äì Varanasi - Kashi in North India), it is also known as Dakshina Kashi The town finds mention in tourism guides, both as a tourist place and a pilgrimage centre.  Archeological Significance  T. Narasipura and its surrounding areas are prehistoric sites where many Neolithic sites have been unearthed by the Department of Archeology and Museums of Karnataka. The rich and fertile areas of the taluka cultivated by the Kaveri and its tributaries, has been the source of continued uninhibited human habitation, over the centuries, as verified by the ancient archeological evidences discovered in the area. The ancient sites excavated in the late fifties and up to mid-sixties (between 1959 and 1965) on the left bank of the Kaveri near the Bhiksheswara Temple, opposite to Narasipura town, which form part of the Upper Kaveri basin, has established the Neolithic phase in the region claiming a date from the first half of second millennium BC which saw the gradual evolution of the peasants into food producing and settled communities responsible for the growth of civilization. The systematic ground excavations comprising burial ground remnants, potteries, graffiti, stone implements, metal objects, beads and bangles, animal remains, human remains, wood remains, etc. examined in depth and in great detail have revealed four cultural phases at the sites, but the most outstanding phase has been deduced as the Neolithic phase. An authoritative report on the \\"Excavations at T.Narasipur\\" by Prof M.Seshadri, Director of Archeology of Mysore published in 1971 provides a detailed insight into the ancient pre-historic civilizational bearings of T. Narasipura town and its surroundings. Demographics India census, Tirumakudalu Narasipura town had a population of 9,930. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%.

The image of Narasimha in the sanctum sanctorum has a weighing balance with a twig with seed of the Gunja (botanical name-Abrus precatorius) tree and hence is called Gunja Narasimha Swamy. It signifies the importance of the temple vis-a-vis the Kasi pilgrimage center by a measure of the seedgulaganji. It has inscriptions dating from the Krishnadevaraya period with a m√©lange of Dravidian and Hoysala Architecture and is renowned for the voluminous records in Nagari script. The Mahakumbhaabhishekam or re- consecration rites of the renovated temple was performed by the donor and his family members from 5 to 9 March 2011. Pancha lingas of T Narasipura region: Agasthyeshwara temple is another famous ancient temple in the town, predating Gunja Narasimha Swamy temple. (Agastya founded and sanctified the Agasthyeshwara temple. This temple complex contains many monuments belonging to the Ganga, Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagara periods at Thirumakudlu, and also at the Bhiksheswara temple, the Moolasthaneshwara temple and the Anandeswara temple in the surrounding area. It is said that Tirumakudalu is where Rishi Agasthya had visualised it as 'Dakshina Kashi' long ago. When he travelled down south to Narsipur, the town was a thick forest. Enamoured by the confluence of the three rivers - Kaveri, Kapila and the undercurrent of Spatika Sarovara - he wanted to install a Shiva Linga there and asked Hanuman to get him a linga from Kashi. Since the auspicious period lasting three-and- a-three-fourths of a galige was fast approaching and Hanuman failed to get the linga on time, the sage created a sand linga himself and consecrated it. An insulted Hanuman, who returned soon, cut off the top portion of the sand linga consecrated by Agasthya. Ever since this incident a perennial presence of water which is believed to be the water of Ganga can be found in the axed summit of the linga, and the same is offered as thirtha (holy water) to the pilgrims. The linga that Hanuman brought was consecrated a little distance away and is called the Hanuman Linga. The Someshwara and Markandeshwara lingams in T Narsipur and the Gargeshwara Lingam at Gargeshwari village, along with the Agasthyeshwara and the Hanuman lingam, form the panchalingas of T Narsipur, just like the five lingams at Talakad.http://www.tnarasipuratown.mrc.gov.in/Tourism Sosale is a small village near T.Narsipur. Sosale is located on the left bank of the Cauvery River near its confluence with the Kabini River, about 3 km away from the Agastheswara Temple at Tirumakudlu. Sosale Devasthana is a beautiful temple in the village. The temple is breathtakingly beautiful and is located in the middle of vast expanses of paddy fields. There are white domes on the back of the temple which is a kind ancient worship ritual of the locals. Religious festivals The chariot festivals of Gunja Narasimha Swamy and Agastheswara, conducted every year, are attended by Lakhs of people. Samgama festival in Tirumakudalu every year on the day of Yugadi festival. Lakhs of people visit the fest and take holy dip in the confluence of Kaveri, Kapila and Spatika Sarovara. The Kumbha Mela of T. Narasipura, of recent origin, since 1989, is an event that occurs once in three years. Organised by the Kumbha Mela Trust under the auspices of senior pontiffs and religious leaders of the State. The congregation is meant to underline the concept of unity in diversity. The Kumbha Mela of Allahabad and Nasik is replicated at T. Narasipura when lakhs of devotees assemble and take a holy dip in the confluence of three rivers.

Located at the intersection of Manhattan and Nassau Avenues in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, it is served by the G train at all times. History This station opened on August 19, 1933 as the initial terminal station for the IND Crosstown Line. With the completion of the Crosstown Line on July 1, 1937, Nassau Avenue ceased to be the line's terminal. Station layout Station stair with bike racks This underground station, has two tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have a green trim line on a black border and name tablets reading \\"NASSAU AVE.\\" in white arial font on a black background and green border. Small \\"NASSAU\\" tiles in white lettering on a black background are directly below the trim line and directional signs in the same style are below the name tablets. Green columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black name plate in white lettering. North of the station is a diamond crossover switch, allowing terminating trains to reverse direction. These switches were used in regular service until July 1, 1937, when the remainder of the Crosstown Line opened. Prior to that, Nassau Avenue was the line's southern terminus. South of the station, the line shifts from Manhattan Avenue onto Union Avenue, running diagonally under McCarren Park. Exits The station's full-time fare control is at the south end, which is the more heavily used of the station's two entry-exit points. A short staircase from each platform goes up to mezzanine level. On the Church Avenue-bound side, one exit-only turnstile and one High Entry/Exit Turnstile leads to two staircases going up to either western corners of Manhattan and Nassau Avenues. The Queens-bound side has the station's full-time turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases going up to either eastern corners of the same intersection. A raised crossover connects the two sides both inside and outside fare control and is split in two by a steel fence. The mezzanine has mosaic directional signs in white lettering on a green background. G trains, which are about half the length of the platform, stop near the south end of the station. Both platforms have an unstaffed platform-level fare control at their north end, with no crossover. On the Church Avenue-bound side, one exit-only turnstile and one High Entry/Exit Turnstile lead to a single staircase going up to the northwest corner of Norman and Manhattan Avenues. On the Queens-bound side, a single full height turnstile leads to a staircase going up to the northeast corner of the same intersection. In preparation for the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown in 2019, the split free/paid area at the south end of the station would have been reconfigured into an exclusively unpaid area. This would remove the free transfer between platforms, but would allow for increased flow from passengers entering and exiting the station.

He was the 16th president of International Sociological Association (2006-2010). Biography Michel Wieviorka is the son of a Polish Jewish family of Holocaust survivors. His siblings are psychiatrist Sylvie Wieviorka, historian Annette Wieviorka and historian Olivier Wieviorka. A former student of Alain Touraine, he is now one of the most renowned sociologists and public intellectuals in France and abroad. A number of his books have been translated into different languages. Wieviorka received some international media attention as an expert following the 2005 civil unrest in France, and was elected in Durban as the 2006-2010 President of the International Sociological Association. Together with Touraine and , Wieviorka developed the method of intervention sociologique and employed it to the study of militant social movements, in particular French anti-nuclear activism and student leagues, but also the famous trade union Solidarnosc in Poland. Following Max Weber's classic concept of interpretative sociology (verstehende Soziologie), intervention sociologique aims at understanding the subjective rationale of actors in the context of larger social conflicts. This concept was opposed to Raymond Boudon's failed attempt to establish a strict rational choice approach in French sociology. Wieviorka is the director of the Centre d'Analyses et d'Interventions Sociologique (CADIS) at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, which was established by Alain Touraine in 1981. Wieviorka is the founder and editor of the sociological journal Le Monde des Debats and was, with Georges Balandier, co-edited the Cahiers internationaux de sociologie until its publication was stopped at the end of 2010 (Avant- propos, Cahiers Internationaux de Sociologie, Vol. 128-129, 2010). In 1989, he was the first scholar to receive the Bulzoni Editore Special Award of the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences, for his book Soci√©t√© et terrorisme (1988, English edition The Making of Terrorism 1993).

Routledge; 2002. . She writes in Arabic and is the first Moroccan woman writer of literature to have her works published in English-language translation.

Almost every radio broadcast was done in French because the radio was a business, and French was used in business. As part of her program, she translated movie scripts into Arabic and did dramatic readings. One of these was the famous autobiography of Malcolm X. She translated this script into Arabic and read it theatrically over the air. Reading other people's books may have led her to make her own work instead. She still to this day refuses to use French because it is the language of their foreign invaders, and Arabic is both Morocco's true language and Islam's language. Speaking Arabic, English and French, Abouzeid still uses primarily Arabic because she does not want to conform to the foreign culture that has taken over her country. She does not want to stand for a culture that she is not a part of. To Leila, the use of the French language is being submissive to invaders that are not even present anymore. In The Last Chapter, Abouzeid explains her opinion on the use of French in her school years in her closing chapter called Afterword: by the author: \\"I was in a private school in Rabat where Arabic and French were the languages of instruction. I loathed reading in French and developed an aversion to using it outside the classroom. This early position against the language of the colonialist proved fortunate, as it kept me from becoming one of the post- colonial Maghrebi [North African] writers producing a national literature in a foreign language. My intense aversion toward French may explain why I turned to English as my means of communication with the West\\" (Abouzeid,The Last Chapter 153). Leila expresses her contempt for the French and their language several times, and even while she was young and in school she hated French. Again in the novel she mentions her hatred for French schooling, \\"I feel bad for mademoiselle Doze, even if she was French\\" (Abouzeid, 6). Leila also has personal reasons to hate the French. The French had arrested and tortured her father for being, and had forced the language upon her. This made her hate the French from a very young age. She does not show any hate for other foreign languages like the English language because they have not personally caused harm to her.  Year of the Elephant  Her first book called Year of the Elephant was published in 1980, and was published in English in 1989 by Texas University. Her book was translated into French only in 2005. Year of the Elephant was named after a battle in Islamic history. The story of the battle is that during an early religious based battle, a flock of birds came and dropped stones on the enemy elephants, causing them to turn around. She compares this historic battle to the Moroccans battling for independence because they are mere birds compared to the gigantic global power of their French rulers.  Mentions of women's education  In The Last Chapter, there are only two girls in Aisha's classroom of 42 students. Out of those two, only Aisha graduated. The misogyny present in real life Morocco is mirrored through this book. In Morocco, women are not very well educated, and something like two women in a class was typical and accepted. Leila did very well in school because of the brain she was not expected to have. Men assumed women were born with no intelligence (which is contradicted by scientific evidence), but it is assumed this is because their education was stifled by the patriarchal government. In a study in 2009, literacy rates in Morocco were recorded at 39.6% for women, 65.7% for men, and only 10% for women from rural areas (DoS p. 2). In other words, women are barely educated, and a majority of them cannot even read, while most men are literate.  Topic of identity in work  Her work touches upon the identity of people, and the nature of the possession of it or lack thereof. In the beginning of The Year of the Elephant, the main character is wandering the streets after a devastating divorce. As she barely holds onto the will to live she states, \\"I feel nothing. Have I lost my own identity?\\" (Abouzeid, Year of the Elephant, 2). Her divorce has taken away her personality and sense of self entirely. Identity is again brought up in The Last Chapter regarding the lost teacher Mademoiselle Doze. Aisha's teacher had been rejected by her fianc√©, and she became a shell of her former self. Abouzeid describes her as just a body showing up for class, not Doze (Abouzeid 6). All soul that was left in her body had seemingly left, and the teacher barely existed. Aisha examines how this sudden change happened, and questions: \\"Can you lose your identity like you use an identification card? Does some unseen part of the machinery snap, suddenly and irreparably\\" (Abouzeid, pg. 6)?

Hamilton. Plot introduction A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable, the title heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus, also known as Merry Gentry. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court. While her aunt tried to kill her as a child, she has since offered her the title as crown princess as the Court needs more heirs. Plot summary Following on almost immediately from the events of Seduced by Moonlight, A Stroke of Midnight begins with Merry and the Ravens attending a press conference in the sithen. This is highly unusual as the home of the sidhe is usually off-limits to the human press. However, it is felt that it is more secure than holding the conference elsewhere. This opinion is challenged almost immediately by the deaths of Beatrice, one of the lesser fae, and a human reporter. Merry, assigned to solve the murders by her aunt, Queen Andais, opts to bring in human forensics in the hope that science might be able to succeed where magic has so far failed - and bring a murderer to justice. The entire novel takes place within approximately one day. Characters in A Stroke of Midnight Major characters A Stroke of Midnight features the following major characters. * Andais - Queen of Air and Darkness, Merry's aunt, the sister of Essus, and mother of Cel.

Her consort is Eamon. * Doyle - Captain of The Ravens, once the Queens Darkness now part of Merry's guard, and included in her many lovers, Part Sidhe, part Hell-Hound (Gabriel Ratchet, et al.), part phouka. * Frost - Raven, The Killing Frost, second in command.

Lineage is half-pixie and half Unseelie sidhe. Powers include subtle ability to have everyone like him. Extremely unpolitical, naive and idealistic, is voice of childhood reasoning for Merry.

Mistranslation of a prophecy given from human prophet to Cel almost got Galen killed, as allies of Cel tried to assassinate Galen to prevent the prophecy. * Kitto - Goblin/sidhe hybrid, Seelie sidhe mother raped during goblin wars, snake-type goblin, given full sidhe status via sex with Merry, has Hand of Reaching. * Meredith NicEssus/Merry Gentry - Title heroine, Princess of Flesh and Blood, Daughter of Essus * Nicca - Raven and Spy for Andais in Merry's home.

History The town is mentioned for the first time in 879, when a document mentioned one place In loco Mozzano prope Decimo. Later it was held by the Soffredinghi family, and then by the Republic of Lucca. After the end of the Lucchese independence, it was part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and, from 1860, of Unified Italy. Main sights Ponte della Maddalena / Ponte del Diavolo / Devil's Bridge. Borgo a Mozzano is dominated by the presence of Ponte della Maddalena also called \\"del Diavolo\\" (Devil's Bridge). The Devil's Bridge is located on the SP2 one kilometer north of downtown. The bridge's majestic structure attracts hundreds of tourists every year. The Gothic Line, a German Second World War military defence line, passed through the comune. Sections of this fortification are well preserved and guided tours of the interior can be arranged. The church and convent of San Francesco is based in Borgo a Mozzano, a monastery which now houses a home for the elderly. The 12th-century church of San Martino in Greppo, Borgo a Mozzano is located in the Diecimo district of the comune. The 19th-century suspension bridge, Ponte delle Catene, Bagni di Lucca or Bridge of Chains, links Chifenti in Borgo a Mozzano to Fornoli in the neighbouring comune of Bagni di Lucca.  Transportation  The town of Borgo a Mozzano is centrally located between the Garfagnana and the Lucchesia, and can be easily reached by car with the SS12 \\"Brennero\\" or the SP2 \\"Lodovica\\". The nearest major airport (50 min drive) is the Galileo Galilei International Airport of Pisa. The comune has two train stations, Borgo a Mozzano and Diecimo-Pescaglia, which are served by the line Lucca-Aulla. Also, an infrequent bus system connects Borgo a Mozzano with the city of Lucca and the rest of the Garfagnana. Bizarrely, fares cannot be purchased on the bus, making it difficult to use. You can make a journey on the bus but often find you cannot return the same day due to lack of services. Busses are not used by tourists due to being so infrequent and not knowing where to purchase the fares.

The group consisted of two paper mills in West Bengal, along with several jute mills and other associated factories, including Kinnison Jute MIll, Titagarh Jute MIll No. 2, Standard Jute Mill, Empire Jute Mill, George Salter India, Britannia Engineering Works, a CESC generating station, and other facilities, most of which were located in Titagarh, and at one time held under and governed by a single managing agency. The Titagarh Paper Mills, long established as India's leading manufacturer of specialty papers, currency note paper, and newsprint, produced a total of 38,550 tons of paper in 1947. The paper production facilities were extensively modernized and expanded between 1966 and 1974, to keep pace with the demands of India's burgeoning post- Independence press, and a third, leading-edge, paper mill of the TPM group was developed in Choudwar, Orissa, but the third paper mill was later sold to Ballarpur Industries Ltd. The successor of Titagarh Paper Mills is Titagarh Industries Ltd., located in Kolkata and formed as an umbrella organization, which in 1994 acquired Titagarh Paper Mills and its related facilities in West Bengal. The diversified company now includes Titagarh Paper Mills, Titagarh Wagons Ltd.,Titagarh Wagons Ltd. Titagarh Steels, and, in other locations, Continental Valves, TIL Valves, Tecalemit Industries Ltd., and Panihati Rubber Ltd.

It is headed by Jagdish Prasad Chowdhury, Executive Chairman of the company. It manufactures railway wagons, Bailey bridges, earth-moving and mining equipment etc. and a wholly owned subsidiary, Titagarh Marines Ltd. has forayed into ship building. * The Empire Jute Co. Ltd. was established at Talpukur, Titagarh, in 1912. It employs around 3,000 people. * Kinnison Jute Mill Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 1918. Kinnison Jute Mill was nationalised in 1980 and made a part of National Jute Manufactures Corporation Limited. It was closed in 2004 and after implementation of a revival scheme Kinnison Jute Mill was reopened in 2011. The Union Cabinet, at a meeting held on 10 October 2018, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, gave the green signal for the closure of National Jute Manufacturers Corporation Ltd. (NJMC) along with its subsidiary Birds Jute and Exporters Ltd. (BJEL). NJMC had been incurring losses for several years and was under reference to BIFR since 1993. The Mills of NJMC which were proposed for revival, namely, Kinnison Mill at Titagarh, Khardah Mill at Khardah and RBHM Mill at Katihar were under suspension since August, 2016. There are a number of jute mills in the Titagarh area listed by the Jute Commissioner: Kelvin Jute Mill (Trend Vyapar), Titagarh Jute Mill (Loomtex Engineering) and Sunbeam Vanijya.

Origin of Parinda community There is no reliable historical data available but some stories prevail among the local folks. According to one story an early ancestor of the parinndo community was very ambitious to be popular so he thought of different ideas but all remained unsuccessful. One day as he sat at home very disappointed he suddenly saw a group of flying birds, an idea struck him to use artificial wings to fly like a bird. He used a pair of hand thrashers as wings. He went into the forest and climbed a tall tree, then attached the wings to his arms. As the wind blew he quickly flexed his wings and jumped down but unaware of the laws of gravity, fell down rapidly. His unbalanced body struck the ground and he hurt his head. People gave him the title of Parinda. Although he was mentally sound he behaved as if psychologically disturbed to avoid people scoffing.

It differs from the Taylor series in its ability to capture \\"memory\\" effects. The Taylor series can be used for approximating the response of a nonlinear system to a given input if the output of this system depends strictly on the input at that particular time. In the Volterra series the output of the nonlinear system depends on the input to the system at all other times. This provides the ability to capture the \\"memory\\" effect of devices like capacitors and inductors. It has been applied in the fields of medicine (biomedical engineering) and biology, especially neuroscience. It is also used in electrical engineering to model intermodulation distortion in many devices, including power amplifiers and frequency mixers. Its main advantage lies in its generality: it can represent a wide range of systems. Thus it is sometimes considered a non-parametric model. In mathematics, a Volterra series denotes a functional expansion of a dynamic, nonlinear, time-invariant functional. Volterra series are frequently used in system identification. The Volterra series, which is used to prove the Volterra theorem, is an infinite sum of multidimensional convolutional integrals. History The Volterra series is a modernized version of the theory of analytic functionals due to the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra in work dating from 1887Vito Volterra. Theory of Functionals and of Integrals and Integro-Differential Equations. Madrid 1927 (Spanish), translated version reprinted New York: Dover Publications, 1959.. Norbert Wiener became interested in this theory in the 1920s from contact with Volterra's student Paul L√©vy. He applied his theory of Brownian motion to the integration of Volterra analytic functionals. The use of Volterra series for system analysis originated from a restricted 1942 wartime reportWiener N: Response of a nonlinear device to noise. Radiation Lab MIT 1942, restricted. report V-16, no 129 (112 pp). Declassified Jul 1946, Published as rep. no. PB-1-58087, U.S. Dept. Commerce. URL: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800212.pdf of Wiener, then professor of mathematics at MIT. It used the series to make an approximate analysis of the effect of radar noise in a nonlinear receiver circuit. The report became public after the war.Ikehara S: A method of Wiener in a nonlinear circuit. MIT Dec 10 1951, tech. rep. no 217, Res. Lab. Electron. As a general method of analysis of nonlinear systems, Volterra series came into use after about 1957 as the result of a series of reports, at first privately circulated, from MIT and elsewhere. Early MIT reports by Brilliant, Zames, George, Hause, Chesler can be found on dspace.mit.edu. The name Volterra series came into use a few years later. Mathematical theory The theory of Volterra series can be viewed from two different perspectives: either one considers an operator mapping between two real (or complex) function spaces or a functional mapping from a real (or complex) function space into the real (or complex) numbers. The latter, functional, perspective is in more frequent use, due to the assumed time-invariance of the system. Continuous time A continuous time-invariant system with x(t) as input and y(t) as output can be expanded in Volterra series as : y(t) = h_0 + \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\int_a^b \\\\cdots \\\\int_a^b h_n(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_n) \\\\prod^n_{j=1} x(t - \\\\tau_j) \\\\,d\\\\tau_j. Here the constant term h_0 on the right side is usually taken to be zero by suitable choice of output level y. The function h_n(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_n) is called the n-th-order Volterra kernel. It can be regarded as a higher-order impulse response of the system. For the representation to be unique, the kernels must be symmetrical in the n variables \\\\tau. If it is not symmetrical, it can be replaced by a symmetrized kernel, which is the average over the n! permutations of these n variables œÑ. If N is finite, the series is said to be truncated. If a, b, and N are finite, the series is called doubly finite. Sometimes the n-th-order term is divided by n!, a convention which is convenient when taking the output of one Volterra system as the input of another (\\"cascading\\"). The causality condition: Since in any physically realizable system the output can only depend on previous values of the input, the kernels h_n(t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_n) will be zero if any of the variables t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_n are negative. The integrals may then be written over the half range from zero to infinity. So if the operator is causal, a \\\\geq 0. Fr√©chet's approximation theorem: The use of the Volterra series to represent a time-invariant functional relation is often justified by appealing to a theorem due to Fr√©chet. This theorem states that a time-invariant functional relation (satisfying certain very general conditions) can be approximated uniformly and to an arbitrary degree of precision by a sufficiently high finite-order Volterra series. Among other conditions, the set of admissible input functions x(t) for which the approximation will hold is required to be compact. It is usually taken to be an equicontinuous, uniformly bounded set of functions, which is compact by the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem. In many physical situations, this assumption about the input set is a reasonable one. The theorem, however, gives no indication as to how many terms are needed for a good approximation, which is an essential question in applications. Discrete time This is similar to the continuous-time case: : y(n) = h_0 + \\\\sum_{p=1}^P \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1=a}^b \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_p=a}^b h_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) \\\\prod^p_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j), : h_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) are called discrete-time Volterra kernels. If P is finite, the series operator is said to be truncated. If a, b and P are finite, the series operator is called doubly finite Volterra series. If a \\\\geq 0, the operator is said to be causal. We can always consider, without loss of the generality, the kernel h_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) as symmetrical. In fact, for the commutativity of the multiplication it is always possible to symmetrize it by forming a new kernel taken as the average of the kernels for all permutations of the variables \\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p. For a causal system with symmetrical kernels we can rewrite the n-th term approximately in triangular form : \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1=0}^M \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_2=\\\\tau_1}^M \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_p=\\\\tau_{p-1}}^M h_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) \\\\prod^p_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j). Methods to estimate the kernel coefficients Estimating the Volterra coefficients individually is complicated, since the basis functionals of the Volterra series are correlated. This leads to the problem of simultaneously solving a set of integral equations for the coefficients. Hence, estimation of Volterra coefficients is generally performed by estimating the coefficients of an orthogonalized series, e.g. the Wiener series, and then recomputing the coefficients of the original Volterra series. The Volterra series main appeal over the orthogonalized series lies in its intuitive, canonical structure, i.e. all interactions of the input have one fixed degree. The orthogonalized basis functionals will generally be quite complicated. An important aspect, with respect to which the following methods differ, is whether the orthogonalization of the basis functionals is to be performed over the idealized specification of the input signal (e.g. gaussian, white noise) or over the actual realization of the input (i.e. the pseudo-random, bounded, almost-white version of gaussian white noise, or any other stimulus). The latter methods, despite their lack of mathematical elegance, have been shown to be more flexible (as arbitrary inputs can be easily accommodated) and precise (due to the effect that the idealized version of the input signal is not always realizable). Crosscorrelation method This method, developed by Lee and Schetzen, orthogonalizes with respect to the actual mathematical description of the signal, i.e. the projection onto the new basis functionals is based on the knowledge of the moments of the random signal. We can write the Volterra series in terms of homogeneous operators, as : y(n) = h_0 + \\\\sum_{p=1}^P H_p x(n), where : H_p x(n) = \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1=a}^b \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_p=a}^b h_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) \\\\prod^p_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j). To allow identification orthogonalization, Volterra series must be rearranged in terms of orthogonal non-homogeneous G operators (Wiener series): : y(n) = \\\\sum_p H_p x(n) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_p G_p x(n). The G operators can be defined by the following: : E\\\\\\\\{H_i x(n) G_j x(n)\\\\\\\\} = 0; \\\\quad i < j, : E\\\\\\\\{G_i x(n) G_j x(n)\\\\\\\\} = 0; \\\\quad i eq j, whenever H_i x(n) is arbitrary homogeneous Volterra, x(n) is some stationary white noise (SWN) with zero mean and variance A. Recalling that every Volterra functional is orthogonal to all Wiener functional of greater order, and considering the following Volterra functional: : H^*_{\\\\overline{p}} x(n) = \\\\prod^{\\\\overline{p}}_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j), we can write : E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y(n) H^*_{\\\\overline{p}} x(n)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum_{p=0}^\\\\infty G_p x(n) H^*_{\\\\overline{p}} x(n)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. If x is SWN, \\\\tau_1 eq \\\\tau_2 eq \\\\ldots eq \\\\tau_P and by letting A = \\\\sigma^2_x, we have : E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y(n) \\\\prod^{\\\\overline{p}}_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{G_{\\\\overline{p}} x(n) \\\\prod^{\\\\overline{p}}_{j=1} x(n - \\\\tau_j)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\overline{p}! A^{\\\\overline{p}} k_{\\\\overline{p}}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_{\\\\overline{p}}). So if we exclude the diagonal elements, {\\\\tau_i eq \\\\tau_j,\\\\ \\\\forall i, j}, it is : k_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) = \\\\frac{E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y(n) x(n - \\\\tau_1) \\\\cdots x(n - \\\\tau_p)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}}{p! A^p}. If we want to consider the diagonal elements, the solution proposed by Lee and Schetzen is : k_p(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_p) = \\\\frac{E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left(y(n) - \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=0}^{p-1} G_m x(n)\\\\right) x(n - \\\\tau_1) \\\\cdots x(n - \\\\tau_p)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}}{p! A^p}. The main drawback of this technique is that the estimation errors, made on all elements of lower-order kernels, will affect each diagonal element of order p by means of the summation \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=0}^{p-1} G_m x(n), conceived as the solution for the estimation of the diagonal elements themselves. Efficient formulas to avoid this drawback and references for diagonal kernel element estimation exist Once the Wiener kernels were identified, Volterra kernels can be obtained by using Wiener-to- Volterra formulas, in the following reported for a fifth-order Volterra series: : h_5 = k_5, : h_4 = k_4, : h_3 = k_3 - 10 A \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_4} k_5(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_4, \\\\tau_4), : h_2 = k_2 - 6 A \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_3} k_4(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_3), : h_1 = k_1 - 3 A \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_2} k_3(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2) + 15 A^2 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau2} \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_3} k_5(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_3), : h_0 = k_0 - A \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1} k_2(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_1) + 3 A^2 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1} \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_2} k_4(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2). Multiple-variance method In the traditional orthogonal algorithm, using inputs with high \\\\sigma_x has the advantage of stimulating high-order nonlinearity, so as to achieve more accurate high-order kernel identification. As a drawback, the use of high \\\\sigma_x values causes high identification error in lower-order kernels, mainly due to nonideality of the input and truncation errors. On the contrary, the use of lower \\\\sigma_x in the identification process can lead to a better estimation of lower-order kernel, but can be insufficient to stimulate high-order nonlinearity. This phenomenon, which can be called locality of truncated Volterra series, can be revealed by calculating the output error of a series as a function of different variances of input. This test can be repeated with series identified with different input variances, obtaining different curves, each with a minimum in correspondence of the variance used in the identification. To overcome this limitation, a low \\\\sigma_x value should be used for the lower-order kernel and gradually increased for higher-order kernels. This is not a theoretical problem in Wiener kernel identification, since the Wiener functional are orthogonal to each other, but an appropriate normalization is needed in Wiener-to-Volterra conversion formulas for taking into account the use of different variances. Furthermore, new Wiener to Volterra conversion formulas are needed. The traditional Wiener kernel identification should be changed as follows: : k_0^{(0)} = E\\\\\\\\{y^{(0)}(n)\\\\\\\\}, : k_1^{(1)}(\\\\tau_1) = \\\\frac{1}{A_1} E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y^{(1)}(n) x^{(1)}(n - \\\\tau_1)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, : k_2^{(2)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2) = \\\\frac{1}{2! A_2^2} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y^{(2)}(n) \\\\prod_{i=1}^2 x^{(2)}(n - \\\\tau_i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} - A_2 k_0^{(2)} \\\\delta_{\\\\tau_1 \\\\tau_2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, : k_3^{(3)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3) = \\\\frac{1}{3! A_3^3} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y^{(3)}(n) \\\\prod_{i=1}^3 x^{(3)}(n - \\\\tau_i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} - A_3^2 \\\\left[k_1^{(3)}(\\\\tau_1) \\\\delta_{\\\\tau_2 \\\\tau_3} + k_1^{(3)}(\\\\tau_2) \\\\delta_{\\\\tau_1 \\\\tau_3} + k_1^{(3)}(\\\\tau_3) \\\\delta_{\\\\tau_1 \\\\tau_2}\\\\right]\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. In the above formulas the impulse functions are introduced for the identification of diagonal kernel points. If the Wiener kernels are extracted with the new formulas, the following Wiener-to-Volterra formulas (explicited up the fifth order) are needed: : h_5 = k_5^{(5)}, : h_4 = k_4^{(4)}, : h_3 = k_3^{(3)} - 10 A_3 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_4} k_5^{(5)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_4, \\\\tau_4), : h_2 = k_2^{(2)} - 6 A_2 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_3} k_4^{(4)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_3), : h_1 = k_1^{(1)} - 3 A_1 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_2} k_3^{(3)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2) + 15 A_1^2 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau2} \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_3} k_5^{(5)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_3, \\\\tau_3), : h_0 = k_0^{(0)} - A_0 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1} k_2^{(2)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_1) + 3 A_0^2 \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1} \\\\sum_{\\\\tau_2} k_4^{(4)}(\\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_1, \\\\tau_2, \\\\tau_2). As can be seen, the drawback with respect to the previous formula is that for the identification of the n-th-order kernel, all lower kernels must be identified again with the higher variance. However, an outstanding improvement in the output MSE will be obtained if the Wiener and Volterra kernels are obtained with the new formulas. Feedforward network This method was developed by Wray and Green (1994) and utilizes the fact that a simple 2-layer neural network (i.e. a multilayer perceptron or feedforward network) is computationally equivalent to the Volterra series and therefore contains the kernels hidden in its architecture. After such a network has been trained to successfully predict the output based on the current state and memory of the system, the kernels can then be computed from the weights and biases of that network. The general notation for the n-th-order volterra kernel is given by : h_n(\\\\tau_1, \\\\dots, \\\\tau_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^M (c_i a_{ni} \\\\omega_{\\\\tau_1 i} \\\\dots \\\\omega_{\\\\tau_n i}), where n is the order, c_i the weights to the linear output node, a_{ji} the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of the output function of the hidden nodes, and \\\\omega_{ji} are the weights from the input layer to the non-linear hidden layer. It is important to note that this method allows kernel extraction up until the number of input delays in the architecture of the network. Furthermore, it is vital to carefully construct the size of the network input layer so that it represents the effective memory of the system. Exact orthogonal algorithm This method and its more efficient version (fast orthogonal algorithm) were invented by Korenberg. In this method the orthogonalization is performed empirically over the actual input. It has been shown to perform more precisely than the crosscorrelation method. Another advantage is that arbitrary inputs can be used for the orthogonalization and that fewer data points suffice to reach a desired level of accuracy. Also, estimation can be performed incrementally until some criterion is fulfilled. Linear regression Linear regression is a standard tool from linear analysis. Hence, one of its main advantages is the widespread existence of standard tools for solving linear regressions efficiently. It has some educational value, since it highlights the basic property of Volterra series: linear combination of non-linear basis- functionals. For estimation, the order of the original should be known, since the Volterra basis functionals are not orthogonal, and thus estimation cannot be performed incrementally. Kernel method This method was invented by Franz and Sch√∂lkopf and is based on statistical learning theory. Consequently, this approach is also based on minimizing the empirical error (often called empirical risk minimization). Franz and Sch√∂lkopf proposed that the kernel method could essentially replace the Volterra series representation, although noting that the latter is more intuitive. Differential sampling This method was developed by van Hemmen and coworkers{cn}} and utilizes Dirac delta functions to sample the Volterra coefficients.

(London, Constable & Company, Ltd, 1912). p.263 It was made a part of the South Lushai Hills on 1 April 1898, while it was part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts earlier. It became a flourishing trade center during 1860-70 when Mizo in north and south had less knowledge of commerce. It was used as the main river port to import goods from what is now Bangladesh through Chittagong city. It had an old fort constructed during British time at the advice of Lt. Col. T.H. Lewin..British Troops and missionaries used this route to reach Mizoram during the Colonial days. It used to take 5 days to reach from Chittagong to Tlabung, a distance of about 90 kilometers after which they would travel another 35 kilometers to reach Lunglei.

Located at the intersection of Broadway and Union Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it is served at all times by the G train.  History  This opened on July 1, 1937, as part of the extension of the Crosstown Line from Nassau Avenue to Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets.  Station layout  This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. The platforms have a green trim line on a black border and name tablets reading \\"BROADWAY\\" in white sans serif lettering on a black background and green border. The i-beam columns in the entire station are dark blue with alternating ones on the platforms having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. Small station signs underneath the trim line read \\"BROADWAY\\" in white lettering on a black background. One of the icon tiles on the northbound platform was incorrectly spelled as \\"BRO _DA_ WAY\\"; this mistake may have been part of the station's original tilework. After the Daily News and several other news outlets reported on the misspelling in February 2009, the two wrong letters were covered with the correct ones printed on stickers, but the stickers were removed by December 2009. In December 2011, the MTA stated the tiles would remain; however, by late February 2020, the tiles with the two wrong letters were permanently swapped. Exits The station has a small mezzanine above the platforms and tracks at the south end, allowing a free transfer between directions. Two staircases from each platform go up to the mezzanine. A turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and three street stairs: one to the southwestern corner of Broadway and Heyward Street, and the remaining two to the southeastern and northeastern corners of Broadway and Union Avenue. There is also a stair to the southwestern corner of Broadway and Union Avenue, but it was closed in the 2000s. A staircase at the southeast corner of Union Avenue and Broadway with the BMT Jamaica Line in the background. The station previously had a full length mezzanine. However, the northern half was closed and to the public, and parts of it currently hold offices while the rest of the mezzanine is used for storage space. The mezzanine had an exit to the northwestern corner of Johnson Avenue and Union Avenue, and a small upper landing with exits to all corners of South 5th Street, Montrose Avenue, and Union Avenue except for the southwestern corner. Free transfer The BMT Jamaica Line lies directly above the staircases to this station; Lorimer Street and Hewes Street are located to the east and west of the entrances, respectively with Lorimer Street being slightly closer to the station. However, there is no permanent free transfer between either of those stations and this one, in spite of requests from riders and transit advocacy groups. Despite the lack of a free transfer, temporary free transfers have been offered during construction or service disruptions. A transfer was provided from July 25, 2014, to September 2, 2014, between Lorimer Street and this station, due to the closure of the IND Crosstown Line under the Newtown Creek for tunnel repairs. A free transfer using a MetroCard between Broadway and Lorimer Street stations was provided during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown from April 2019 until May 31, 2020 during weekends and late nights. A temporary free MetroCard transfer to and from the Hewes Street station was also made available. These two transfers were honored through the end of May 2020, even though L train tunnel work was completed on April 26.  Unfinished station  \\"Broadway\\" mosaic The north end of the Broadway station has been blocked by false walls. This northern third of the platform level area consists of passages that would have served as transfers to an unfinished station on a level directly above the Crosstown Line tracks (provisionally called South Fourth Street or Union Avenue). The unfinished station was built as part of a planned expansion of the Independent Subway System. The station is a semi-complete shell with four island platforms and six track beds, having the same layout as Hoyt‚ÄìSchermerhorn Streets station.

These lines would have become two major trunk lines going east; one would have run under Utica Avenue, and the other would have run towards the Rockaways along Myrtle Avenue and Central Avenue Line.Project for Expanded Rapid Transit Facilities, New York City Transit System, dated July 5, 1939 The closed mezzanine area of the Broadway station has stairs at its north end to an upper level mezzanine directly above the unfinished station. This mezzanine has stairs leading to the northern corners of the intersection of South 4th Street, Meserole Street, and Union Avenue. However, it has no stairs leading to the unfinished station itself. Like the closed mezzanine area of the Broadway station, the upper level mezzanine is used for storage. In 2010, dozens of street artists created murals on the walls of the unfinished station over the course of 18 months, collectively called \\"the Underbelly Project\\", without clearance from the MTA. Afterwards, the MTA removed access to the transfer passage on the northbound platform at Broadway and replaced dilapidated fencing blocking closed areas with cinderblock walls.

The technical crew can consist of only a few individuals, or be divided up into a multitude of positions depending on the scale and needs of a particular production. The roles, composition and number of workers in a tech crew can change significantly depending on the nature of an event, and often evolves as the production does. In a small scale production, the technical crew might consist of a single person, operating the lights and controlling the volume of the sounds and music. In a large scale productions, the technical crew can consist of dozens of different departments and may run into the hundreds of individuals. Each department has their own specific job that pertains to their area of expertise, but they are all part of the technical crew. Job categories The technical crew on a performance fall into different categories based on area of expertise and responsibilities. The most common categories (those encountered on the largest variety of productions) include: Stage Manager, Production Manager, Rigging, Lighting, Sound, and Technical Directors. Each of these departments have sub-categories, often breaking down tasks in more detail. Responsibilities Theatre technical crew have significant responsibilities in regards to ensuring that a production runs smoothly.

Although capacitance sensing methods were in widespread use the idea of using capacitance measurement to form images is attributed to Maurice Beck and co-workers at UMIST in the 1980s.S M Huang, A Plaskowski, C G Xie and M S Beck, Capacitance-based tomographic flow imaging system, Electronics Letters, 24 (7), 1988, pp 418‚Äì19. Although usually called tomography, the technique differs from conventional tomographic methods, in which high resolution images are formed of slices of a material. The measurement electrodes, which are metallic plates, must be sufficiently large to give a measureable change in capacitance. This means that very few electrodes are used and eight or twelve electrodes is common. An N-electrode system can only provide N(N‚àí1)/2 independent measurements. This means that the technique is limited to producing very low resolution images of approximate slices. However, ECT is fast, and relatively inexpensive.

Plot introduction A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable, the title heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus, also known as Merry Gentry. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court. While her aunt tried to kill her as a child, she has since offered her the title as crown princess as the Court needs more heirs. Plot summary Seduced by Moonlight begins shortly after the events of A Caress of Twilight. Kurag, Goblin King, is insisting upon proof that Kitto has become sidhe following sex with Merry. She offers an extra month of their alliance for every goblin hybrid she can bring into sidhe magic. During the discussions, Siun, Kitto's nightmarish, spidery former mistress, appears and he is terrified. It is revealed that Rhys also swore blood price on her, as it was she that took his eye when he failed to \\"glow\\" for her during sex. In his fear, Kitto accidentally uses the Hand of Reaching to open a portal through the mirror. Siun falls through and is trapped half- way, and after some negotiation, Kurag allows the Ravens to do what they like. Kitto viciously wounds her, and Rhys kills her with a sword. It is revealed that Meredith is a vessel for the Goddess Danu when she inadvertently brings the pregnant Maeve Reed back into her god-head, and gives Frost newfound god status (which he is not comfortable with). The cup or cauldron also reappears after Merry has a dream about it, an effect that has significant impact upon the sidhe who believed it lost forever. During sex with Merry many of her lovers suffer unexpected side-effects: * Rhys is brought back into his god- head * Frost is brought into his god-head * Sage is turned into a full-sized sidhe * Nicca is possessed by Dian Cecht * Doyle regains his shape-shifting abilities (turning into a dog and a horse), plus ones he never had previously (an eagle). Merry and her lovers return to the Courts. Upon the flight back, Merry is presented with the Queen's ring by Rhys. This is not only a symbol of her status as heir, but also a potent artifact in its own right. It was known as the happy ever after ring as it permitted sidhe to find their perfect mates. When they arrive at the airport they are greeted by several of the Queen's Ravens as well as human policemen. The Queen has insisted that Merry take to her bed any of the sidhe that the ring recognises. A short while after their arrival, they attend a press conference. A policeman is bewitched and shooting breaks out. Merry is saved by Frost and others of the Ravens. Yet more Ravens await Merry at the sithen. The Queen insists that Merry beds two out of the four before she appears before her. The result is the appearance of a spring, from which Merry fills a cup. Andais, apparently insane with bloodlust, is attacking her men. The Ravens attempt to intervene and protect one another. Merry uses her Hand of Blood to draw wounds upon her aunt. The Green Man then gives Merry the ability to heal all those in the room. It is discovered that a spell was used to incite the Queen to murder. The plot was hatched by those amongst the court who feared that a mortal Queen, Merry, would result in the sidhe ceasing to exist. Merry is challenged by one, Miniver, and they duel before the court. Meredith is declared the winner.

It serves about 550 pupils, from the town of Maybole and the villages of Dalrymple, Crosshill, Kirkmichael, Straiton, Minishant, Dunure, Dailly, Kirkoswald, Maidens, and surrounding farms. It was last inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectors in March 2015. The school's motto is Superbe Gerimus which is Latin for \\"We bear it proudly\\". The school coat of arms is a red chevron, indicating Carrick, on a silver background, with three azure lions, representing Maybole, and a gold book and quills, illustrating the school. The school houses are Culzean House (blue), Crossraguel House (red), and Cargill House (yellow) and also previously included Cassilis (green) History As both a primary and a secondary school, the school that was later to become Carrick Academy was founded in 1845. The three schools in Maybole (including the original parish school first mentioned in 1630) united under the name of Maybole Public School, which was then changed in 1891 to Maybole Ladyland School. The school then assumed the title of Maybole Carrick Academy in 1905. The new academy moved to its current site in 1926 with the opening of the present Old Building. The New Building was added in 1974, where the school became what it is now. Heraldry The school badge originates from the red chevron in a silver field which is the coat of arms of Carrick. The blue lions with red claws and red tongue came from the coat of arms worn by the Bruce family. When Robert the Bruce, the Earl of Carrick, became King of Scots his title moved into the Scottish royal family and subsequently into the present royal family. Prince Charles is the current Earl of Carrick. Maybole is the ancient capital of Carrick which is the most southerly of the three historical divisions of Ayrshire. The Kennedys of Cassillis, the principal land owners of Carrick and known as the \\"Kings of Carrick\\", were in the main responsible for providing a school building and the schoolmaster's salary. In the badge, the black in the quills is taken from the black cross-crosslets in this family's coat of arms. The book is the normal symbol used to indicate a school badge. The motto Superbe Gerimus was supplied by the Latin Department and means \\"We bear it proudly\\". The colours, blue and gold, were chosen because of their association with the Kennedy family. For distinguished service at Beug√© in 1421, a member of the Kennedy family was given the right to use the blue and gold colours of the royal family of France.

The album, Loggins' first since splitting from Loggins and Messina, represents a slight move away from the folk-rock leanings of his previous recordings towards a more polished, soft rock sound. Despite featuring production by famed Billy Joel collaborator Phil Ramone and jazz keyboardist Bob James, Celebrate Me Home (eventually certified platinum by the RIAA) failed to make a significant impact on the Billboard album charts, peaking at number 27.

Enrollment rates amongst Palestinians are relatively high by regional and global standards. According to a youth survey in 2003, 60% between the ages 10‚Äì24 indicated that education was their first priority. Youth literacy rate (the ages 15‚Äì24) is 98.2%, while the national literacy rate is 91.1%. Enrollment ratios for higher education were 46.2% in 2007, among the highest in the world. In 2016 Hanan Al Hroub was awarded the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize for her work in teaching children how to cope with violence.Daud Abdullah, https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170828-education-is-a-right-being-denied- to-palestinian-children-and-israel-is-the-culprit/ 'Education is a right being denied to Palestinian children, and Israel is the culprit,' Middle East Monitor 28 August 2017 Education System There are three types of schools from perspective of gender in Palestine: boys' schools (37%), girls' schools (35%), and co-educational schools (29%). In Palestine's education system, compulsory basic education includes Grades 1 to 10 and this is divided into the preparatory stage (Grades 1 to 4) and the empowerment stage (Grades 5 to 10). Secondary education (general secondary education and a few vocational secondary schools) covers Grades 11 and 12. In tertiary education, there are 11 universities (10 private and one public) and 11 technical colleges (4 Palestinian Authority, 2 UNWARY, 4 public and 1 private), all of which mainly offer four-year courses. Additionally, there are 19 community colleges (1 Palestinian Authority, 9 public, 2 UNWARY, and 7 private) that mainly offer two-year diploma courses in technical and commercial specializations. The first refugee camp schools for were established by the Red Cross in 1949.Rosendo, Maya, Confronting the occupation: work, education, and political activism of Palestinian families in a refugee camp, Stanford University Press, 2004, p.213; not to be confused with the Palestine Red Crescent Society established in 1968 initially to operate ambulances First UNWARY elementary six-year schools begun in 1959‚Äì60 school year.Digger Wolf rum, Christian Philip, United Nations: law, policies, and practice: Volume 2, 1995, p.1358 UNWARY schools offer Grades 1 to 10 and do not provide secondary education (Grade 11 and 12). Rwanda's education provision has played a major role in Palestinian education since 1967 Even if students in Grade 1 to 3 do not achieve well, they are not to repeat a grade at that level by the ministry policy. However, students in Grades 4 to 12 are to repeat by the ministry regulations (maximum of 5 percent of a class cohort), which is based on the students' total average achievement score for a year. There is no remedial teaching for the students nominated to repeat during their repeated year. Education Management University College of Applied Sciences The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) was first established and took responsibility in 1994. (MOEHE website) In 1996, the MOEHE was divided into two separate ministries: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education, and these two ministries were merged again to become the MOEHE in 2002. (Nicolai 2007) The MOEHE has a responsibility for the whole education sector from pre-primary to higher education and for recruiting and training teachers as well. The MOEHE works as the liaison on training issues with the education directorates. (Mustafa and Bisharat 2008) The MOEHE is also in charge of managing governmental educational institutions and supervising private educational institutions and institutions run by UNRWA. Education in Palestine is centralized in regard to its curriculum, textbooks, instructions, and regulations. The administrative structure of the general education is composed of 22 fields' directorates (districts offices) of education, including 16 in the West Bank and 6 in Gaza The mission of the MOEHE is 1) to ensure education for all, 2) improve its quality and its standards, and 3) to ultimately develop citizens with sound and balanced characters Education Finance Funding for the education system comes from the government budget through the Ministry of Finance Government expenditure on education as % of total government expenditure is 17.9 in 2003 The remaining funding in education comes from donors and international organizations In Palestine, access to schools is primarily constrained by physical conditions and movement restrictions. However, insufficient investment in upgrading education has led to crowding and deterioration in the learning environment. Schools have lost their revenue base from fees, and faced difficulties in securing basic school supplies and materials. The limited services for students with special needs, facing psychological trauma, has also become evident. The inequity in resource allocation between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has become serious as well. Education Policy A formal sector plan was not developed until five years after the creation of the MOEHE but this does not mean that planning was ignored until then. A formal five-year plan was first discussed in 1998, and it took more than a year to prepare. UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) provided technical assistance in developing the plan, and the MOEHE set up two working teams; one focused on policy and another worked the details. Five-Year Education Development Plan 2000‚Äì2005 had five goals: 1) to provide access to education for all children, 2) to improve the quality of education, 3) to develop formal and non-formal education, 4) to develop management capacity in planning, administration, finance, and 5) to develop human resources across the education system. Education Development Strategic Plan (EDSP) 2008‚Äì2012 has four goals: 1) to increase access of school-aged children and students of all education levels and improve the ability of the education system to retain them (Access), 2) to improve the quality of teaching and learning (Quality), 3) to develop the capacity for planning and management and to improve the financial and management systems used (Management), and 4) to realize a gradual conversion of the higher education sector from a supply-oriented to a demand-oriented sector, which will gradually guarantee more compatibility between higher education outputs and labor market(s) need from qualitatively and quantitatively (Relevance). Goal 1 to 3 is for pre-school, general, non-formal, higher education, and vocational education, and Goal 4 is only for higher education and vocational education. Pre-Primary Education Pre-primary education is for children, usually starting at 4 years and up to the age of 6 years. According to the 2004/2005 PCBS Educational Institutions Census, there were approximately 898 private kindergartens, and only 3 operated by the Palestinian Authority. (WB and BCRD 2006) Although most kindergartens are private, the MOEHE provides technical and educational supervision, teacher training and licensing, and some funding The number of male and female children was roughly equal, and most kindergartens have co-educational system. Gross enrollment ratios for pre-primary education are 29.9% for total, 30.3% for boys, and 29.5% for girls Basic education Preparation stage In the preparatory stage, a total of 383,748 students (male 195,618 and female 188,130) were enrolled in schools during 2005/2006 school year. Among them, 238,500 students (62 percent of total) were in schools provided by Palestinian Authority, 109,419 students (29 percent) were in schools provided by UNRWA, and 35,829 students (9 percent) were in private schools Gross enrollment ratios for preparatory stage are 80.4% for total, 80.4% for boys, and 80.4% for girls There is no grading system (marks) or written tests in Grade 1 to 4. Teachers assess students on the basis of their progress through formative assessments, observations, student portfolios, and other assigned student work as the basis of their graduating judgment Empowerment stage In the empowerment stage, a total of 569,873 students (male 296,247 and female 283,626) were enrolled in schools during the 2005‚Äì2006 school year. Among them, 398,672 students (70 percent of total) were in schools provided by the Palestinian Authority, 145,133 students (25 percent) are in schools provided by UNRWA, and 26,068 students (5 percent) were in private schools Gross enrollment ratios for empowerment stage were 97.5% for total, 95.7% for male, and 99.5% for female students. There is a graduating examination in Grade 9. This examination is offered to students who have not completed Grade 9 or have left school and want to achieve a Grade 9 competency level equivalent to the Certificate of General Secondary Education Examination Palestinian students at Grade 8 participated in TIMSS in 2003 and 2007. The score for mathematics test was 390 in 2003 and 367 in 2007 The score for science test was 435 in 2003 and 404 in 2007 Secondary education Secondary education consists of two years, and includes an academic and a vocational program. (MOEHE 2005b) Students are able to select either of these programs, but their right to entry is based on successful completion of Grade 10 based on the results of their final assessments In secondary academic education in 2005/2006, a total 118,868 students were enrolled in schools. Among them, most students were enrolled in schools provided by the Palestinian Authority (114,790 students, 97 percent of total), and about 3 percent of the students were enrolled in private schools. UNRWA does not provide education at secondary level Gross enrollment ratios for empowerment stage were 97.5% for total, 95.7% for male, and 99.5% for female students. In secondary vocational education during the 2005/2006 school year, a total of 5,999 students were enrolled in schools. Among them, most students were enrolled in schools operated by the Palestinian Authority (5,653 students, 94 percent of total), and about 6 percent of the students were enrolled in private schools Gross enrollment ratios for empowerment stage are 97.5% for total, 95.7% for male, and 99.5% for female students. Gross enrollment ratios for secondary education were 75.2% for total, 69.2% for male, and 81.6% for female students. In the secondary education 2005/2006 school year, there were in total 3,734 classes, of which 185 classes (5 percent) were co-educational. While in the West Bank the share of co-educational classes was 7.4 percent, in The Gaza Strip only 0.1 percent of the total classes were co-educational, in fact only one school. Certificate of General Secondary Education Examination (Tawjihee) was issued for high school students in grade 12 to prepare them for admission to the universities Higher education Islamic University of Gaza The university education consists of four years college education to obtain a bachelor's degree and additional two years for a master's degree. Some colleges provide two years of education for a diploma course. During 2005 in the West Bank and Gaza, there were 10 universities, 1 distance education university (Al-Quds Open University), 13 university colleges, and 19 community colleges. Most of these universities were established and developed mostly since the period of Israel occupation begun in 1967. Majority of the universities are non-profit institutions. They combine fund-raise with funding received from the Palestinian Authority. In Higher Education Institutions, 138,139 students were enrolled during the 2004/2005 academic year. Among them, 76,650 students (55% of total) were enrolled in universities, 46,453 students (34%) are enrolled in the distance education university, 6,034 students (4%) were enrolled in university colleges, and 9,002 students (7%) were enrolled in the community colleges. The male students share is greater than that of female students in the universities, open university and university colleges. On the other hand, the share of female students is greater in the community colleges.(MOEHE 2005a) Gross enrollment ratios for higher education were 46.2% for total, 41.6% for male, and 50.9% for female students in 2007. More students enrolled in certain academic programs such as social science, education, and humanities and arts in higher education, and the share of science and engineering is proportionately less. Demand for tertiary education has increased significantly in the past decade with students enrolled in tertiary education institutions more than tripling between 1995 and 2006. Some academics have suggested that Palestinian Authority higher education system needs to not only satisfy the increasing demand from the growing population of secondary education graduates, but also to maintain quality and relevance to meet the changing demands of the global economy. In addition, public financing for tertiary education is considered insufficient given Palestinian Authority financial circumstances. The system heavily depends on student fees, which represent 60% of universities' operating costs. The MOEHE has developed a new student loan scheme for tertiary education. The objectives of this loan scheme are: 1) to create a sustainable resource that will assist students into the future, 2) to ensure that students understand their responsibility to share the cost of their education, 3) to provide a strong, streamlined repayment system that is easy and fair (repayments of loans must be collected from all students), and 4) to provide a collection mechanism that will ensure sustainability (a revolving fund). UNESCO states that because of \\"isolation, [the Universities] have suffered in particular from the absence of research departments.\\" \\"Inter-university co-operation programmes are underway, such as TOKTEN, PEACE and MEDCAMPUS. They are supported by partners such as the European Union, UNESCO and the UNDP. The PEACE programme (Palestinian-European Academic Co-operation in Education) involves 23 Palestinian Authority and European universities. It has been particularly noteworthy for having allowed students and teachers from the West Bank and Gaza to be admitted to European faculties at a time when the university establishments of Gaza and the West Bank were closed. In a second phase, it is to provide for the dispatch of missions of volunteer academics, on sabbatical, from Europe, North America and the rest of the world to the West Bank and Gaza.\\" \\"Palestinian students wishing to obtain a doctorate must study either in Israel, or overseas.\\" Starting in November 2017, around half the foreign lecturers in Palestinian universities began to be informed that their residency visas would not be extended because they had been \\"living in the area for more than five years.\\" In addition, their spouses were required to pay tens of thousands of shekels as guarantee that they would not work. Academic organizations *Palestinian Academic Network *Durham Palestine Educational Trust Technical and vocational education and training Formal vocational education starts after basic education and lasts two years. After graduation, students can join university colleges (diploma in 2 years or bachelor's degree in 4 years) or colleges (2 years). There are five streams in school-based vocational training: industrial, agricultural, commercial, hotel and home economics. Fifteen secondary industrial schools offer 17 specializations and 2,185 students are enrolled in 2004/05. All but three of these industrial schools are funded by government. Sixty four academic secondary schools offer commercial subjects and nearly 3,000 students are enrolled. The two hotel training schools are private. Total students enrollment for the five streams increased from around 3,000 in 1999/2000 to 5,561 in 2004/05. This is considerably lower than the MOEHE 2000‚Äì2005 target (9,000 students enrollment). This is partly because this type of training remains unpopular among most students and parents/guardians. The demand for most vocational training is weak. A few community colleges with limited capacity of 200‚Äì300 students have high applicant-place ratio (especially for nursing and the UNRWA Gaza Training Centre). The rest of community colleges have only around one applicant-place ratio. Manual skilled occupations continue to have low status and only the least academically able students are expected to enroll at TVET institutions. The majority of colleges have low student-teacher ratios and high unit cost. In addition to community colleges, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs provides other TVET opportunities. Twelve Rehabilitation Centers that target dropouts, slow learners are run by this Ministry. Total enrollments were around 850 in 2004/05 with 380 graduates. The Ministry of Ex- Detainees also offers TVET to around 1,000 students and most of them are males. Four hundred fifty students are enrolled in the National Institute of Information Technology. The ministry also handles TVET centres (enrollment: 6600 students, which offer curriculum in trade (2 years), technical/semi- professional (2 years) and certificate courses (1 ‚Äì2 years). Besides, The UNRWA provides short-term courses (8‚Äì40 weeks). National Curriculum A unified curriculum was applied in both the West Bank and the Gaza after using curriculum from other nations for a long time. The implementation phase of the national curriculum began by implementing national textbooks in all subjects in 2000. The textbooks were first implemented in Grade 1 and Grade 6, followed by textbooks for Grade 2 and Grade 7 in 2001. By the beginning of the 2006‚Äì2007, all students in all grades were using the Palestinian national textbooks ;Research institutes * Applied Research Institute, Jerusalem * Institute for Palestine Studies * Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS) ;Schools * American School of Palestine * Al-Arkam school * Rafah Elementary Co-Ed \\"B\\" School * Ramallah Friends Schools  Education for Palestinian Refugees  UNRWA has been the main provider of basic education to Palestinian refugee children since 1950. Basic education is available to all registered refugee children free of charge up to around the age of 15. By 31 December 2009, there were close to 482,000 students enrolled in 691 schools.Acquiring Knowledge and Skills, UNRWA-at-a-glance UNRWA schools follow the curriculum of their host countries. This allows UNRWA pupils to progress to further education or employment holding locally recognised qualifications and fits with the sovereignty requirements of countries hosting refugees.Education, UNERWA web site In the 1960s UNRWA schools became the first in the region to achieve full gender equality. Overcrowded classrooms containing 40 or even 50 pupils are common. Almost all of UNRWA's schools operate on a double shift ‚Äì where two separate groups of pupils and teachers share the same buildings. Not all refugee children attend UNRWA schools. In Jordan and Syria children have full access to government schools and many attend those because they are close to where they live. UNRWA also operates eight vocational and technical training centres and three teacher training colleges that have places for around 6,200 students.

Encycylopedia Astronautica it has also more recently been used by North Korea but found its greatest applications (under the name TG-02) in the Soviet Union, for example, in the propulsion projects of the A.M. Isayev Chemical Engineering Design Bureau. Its name is a reference to the tonka bean; as it was invented during the Second World War, it has no connection to the similarly named toys. Its composition is approximately 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine, with the most common oxidizer used to burn it, nitric acid or its anhydrous nitric oxide derivatives (classified as the AK-2x family in the Soviet Union). In a similar manner to the chemically related nitric acid /aniline(Benzamine) propellant combination used in the USA's first indigenous sounding rockets, the WAC Corporal and Aerobee, this fuel-oxidizer combination is likewise hypergolic(spontaneously ignites upon mixing, with little delay). The combination has a maximum practical Isp of approximately 216-248 at sea level, with the latter figure stated as a specification for the R-21 (missile)(The Soviet Union's first Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile) which was first fielded in 1963.Nodong missile analysis by FAS. data on R-13/SS-N-4 and R-21/SS-N-5 Isayev engine S5.38 The history of study into the hypergolic propellant in the Soviet Union, after the reverse-engineering of the German Wasserfall missile, began in greatest part after its selection for the deeply studied but ultimately shelved Soviet Burya-intercontinental cruise missile project of the early 1950s, the knowledge base created in this project was then later put to use in the long serving, 1960s era, Kh-22(anti-ship cruise missile),Soviet/Russian Cruise Missiles, Technical Report APA-TR-2009-0805 and the S5.4 engine - the original spacecraft propulsion braking or de-orbit engine used on the upper stages of the R-7 (rocket family) derived Vostok (spacecraft), Voskhod (spacecraft), and Zenit (satellite), which all burnt TG-02/AK-2x in low earth orbit and thus were notably responsible for bringing, the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, back to earth in Vostok 1(1961). The most globalized use of Tonka however is as an igniter in many Soviet Scud missile variants and its descendants (N.Korean Nodong), which are principally propelled by nitric acid and kerosene (TM-185), a combination that in contrast does not spontaneously ignite when mixed and therefore necessitates an ignition source, a solution to this problem was the design of a co-injection system of a few kilograms of Tonka fuel beginning at the moment ignition is desired.Debris from North Korea‚Äôs Launcher: What It Shows The progenitor Scud engine, the S2.253, which has a (sea level) Isp of 219 seconds.http://www.friends-partners.org/mwade/engines/s2253.htm popularized this ignition arrangement. Triethylamine / xylidine mixtures composed the TX and TX2 fuels of the French SEPR rocket engines of the 1950s, used for auxiliary rocket power in the Mirage IIIC. In aircraft use, TX fuels were later replaced by non-toxic kerosene jet fuels, simplifying fuelling of the aircraft. Little change was required to the engines but as this was no longer hypergolic with nitric acid, a small tank of TX was retained for ignition. The use of Tonka by amateurs is not advised, as the exact proportions of ingredients necessary for the mixture to work as desired, rather than fail catastrophically, is a function both of the ingredients' purity, and of their temperature during use.

During British rule  During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Hindu Shekhawat rajput officials of British Raj based at Tosham killed the Bhati and Ranghar Muslim Rajputs of Jamalpur and Mangali. These Hindu Thakur (Shekhawat) were granted the Thikana of Tosham as a Pargana under Shekhawati in 1870 by the British raj and Maharaja Mukund Singh for their services.  Tosham Thikana  Tosham Thikana was granted as a thikana by Shekhawati ruler Maharaja Mukund Singh in 1870 to Kunwar Abhaya Singh, the son of Maharaja Raj Singh II. Around 1755, Rajputs of this area and all of central and south Haryana came under the Maratha Empire under Maharaja Khande Rao Holkar of Indore when he attacked the independent Mughal chieftain, Ismail Beg, Ismail Beg escaped to Madhogarh and established a post near Madhogarh fort, captured Ismail Beg at Kanud, imprisoned him at Agra Fort and put him to death on 1794. Maratha Maharaj Mahadaji Shinde (Scindia) of Gwalior had conquered Rania, Fatehabad and Sirsa from Bhatti Rajput Muslims. Haryana came under Maratha Empire. Mahad Ji divided Haryana in four territories: Delhi (Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, his family and areas surrounding Delhi), Panipat (Kernal, Sonepat, Kurukshetra, and Ambala), Hisar (Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, parts of Rohtak), Mewat (Gurgaon, Rewari, Narnaul, Mahendragarh).

Tosham rock inscription  Tosham rock inscription, dating from 4th to 5th century, is an epigraph documenting the establishment of a monastery and the building of water tanks at water cascade for followers of the Satvata (ancient Yadava kingdom) Two interesting antiquities are to be seen in the neighborhood of Tosham. A baradari and another Sanskrit inscription on a rock on the face of the hill to the west of the town. The ToshƒÅm rock inscription is an epigraphic record documenting the establishment of a monastery and the building of water tanks for followers of the SƒÅtvata religion. Found in Tosham, Haryana (India), It is not dated but can be assigned to the early fifth century CE. The inscription records the lineage and building activities of a line of SƒÅtvata religious preceptors (ƒÅcƒÅrya) dating to the 4th and 5th centuries CE. This is an important record for the history of the Vai·π£·πáava faith. The kinship and clan position of the SƒÅtvatas is described in the article on the Yadavas. It does not appear to have been as yet satisfactorily translated. It seems to refer to a Scythian king Tushara who appears to have conquered the Gupta Galotkacha who reigned from about A. D. 50 to A. D. 79 and is referred to in the inscription. There appears to be evidence to show that the Tosham hill was a monastery of Buddhist monks or Bhikshus. The date of the inscription is said to be A. D. 162‚Äì224.  Tosham rock paintings  In 2013, rudimentary rock paintings (supposedly circa 5th century CE) at the site of Tosham rock inscription were discovered.

Trimbakeshwar town is an ancient Hindu Pilgrim centre located at the source of the Godavari River, the longest river in peninsular India. The Godavari River, which is considered sacred within Hinduism, originates from Bramhagiri mountains at Trimbakeshwar and meets the sea near Rajahmudry. The town is at the foothills of the Brahmagiri and Gangadwar mountains. Situated in a wooded area, it is a popular destination for tourists and Hindu pilgrims. History There was built a city which later on became famous as Trimbakeshwar. In the period of the Peshwas regime Nana Saheb Peshwa had instructed to construct the Trimbakeshwar temple and developed and beautified the city of Trimbakeshwar. Neel Mani * Neel Mani - Once a large Neel Mani (Blue Diamond), Now named as Nassak Diamond, adorned the Trimbakeshwar temple. The Diamond was looted by English colonel named J. Briggs. from Bajirao Peshva. In turn, Briggs delivered the diamond to Francis Rawdon-Hastings which then went to England. Religious significance The Hindu belief is that those who visit Trimbakeshwar attain salvation or Moksha. Trimbakeshwar is considered as the most sacred town India. There are many reasons for this belief. Godavari originates from the Brahmagiri hills in this town and it is believed that it is the birthplace of Lord Ganesha, known as place of Tri-Sandhya Gayatri. This place is believed to be the holiest and ideal place to do Shraddha ceremony, a Hindu ritual for the salvation of the soul. Sinhastha Mahatmya speaks of Lord Rama having made the Yatra at Trimbakeshwar. A shraddha on the river Godavari gives great satisfaction to the forefathers. If it is not done in this place, it is considered as a religious sin. So Ganga Pujan, Ganga Bhet, Deh Shuddhi Prayaschitta, Tarpan Shraddha, Vayan, Dasha Dana, Gopradan etc. rituals are done in Trimbakeshwar. Mundana and Tirtha Shraddha are also performed here. The Lord Shiva at Trimbakeshwar is worshipped by recitations of Rudra, Rudri, Laghu Rudra, Maha Rudra or Ati Rudra puja. Actually Rudraksha is a religious fruit which is said to be found in Lord Shiva's neck in the form of Rudra garland. Some of the trees of Rudraksha are also found in Trimbakeshwar. The holy Jyotirlinga circuit will be complete with the visit to this sacred Shiva temple. Other facilities at Trimbakeshwar The public and religious institutions in the town are Veda shala, Sanskrit Pathashala, Kirtan Sanstha, Pravachan Sanstha, two gymnasiums, Lokmanya Free Reading Room, municipal office, post and telegraph office, Bus station, dispensary and a police sub-inspector's office. Sanskrit Pathashala has produced a good many disciples who have become Shastris and Pandits. Noted film maker and father of Indian cinema, Dadasaheb Phalke was born here. Pradakshina (Ring routes/ Pheri) There are two pradakshinas (ring routes) in this kshetra - one round the Brahmagiri and the other one round Hariharagiri. Pilgrim has to go for pradakshina with holy garment early in the morning visiting and bathing in various tirthas. The tour is to be completed in either a day, three days. Godavari River Brahmadev worshipped God Trivikram when he came to Satya Loka (on earth) with the same holy water of the Ganges, to get the river Ganges held up by God Shankar on his head, to flow. River Ganges in the form of a woman was enjoying with Lord Shiva, which was noticed by Lord Shiva's wife Parvati. She planned to drive Ganges away from her husband. Parvati and her son Ganesh came to live in Gautama's Ashram with Parvati's friend Jaya. There was a famine of 24 years and people were affected by the pangs of hunger. However, Varun - the God of Rains, pleased with Sage Gautama arranged rains every day in Gautama's Ashram (dwelling place) which was in Trimbakeshwar. Gautama used to sow rice in the surrounding fields of his Ashram in the morning, reap the crop in the afternoon and with it fed a large group of Rishis, who took shelter in his Ashram on account of the famine. The blessings of the group of rishis increased the merit (Punya) of Gautama. Lord Indra's position became shaky because of his increased merit. So Indra ordered clouds to rain all over Trimbakeshwar, so that the famine will be over and Rishis will go back and the increasing merits of Gautama will be weakened. Although the famine was over, Gautama urged the Rishis to stay back and kept on feeding them and gaining merit. Once he saw a cow grazing in the paddy field and he drove her away by throwing Darbha (sharp, pointed grass). The slender cow died by this. It was Jaya - Parvati's friend, who had taken the form of a cow. This news upset the Rishis and they refused to luncheon at his Ashram. Gautama requested Rishis to show a way out of this sin. He was advised to approach Lord Shiva and request him to release Ganges and a bath in the Ganges would set him free of his sins. Gautama then practiced penance by going to the peak of Brahmagiri. Lord Shankara was pleased by his worships and gave him the Ganges. However, Ganges was not prepared to part with Lord Shiva, which irritated him. He made TandavNrutya (dance) on the peak of Brahmagiri and dashed his jata there. Frightened by this action, Ganges appeared on Brahmagiri. Later on Ganges appeared in the Trimbak Tirtha. Gautama praised her but she off and on appeared on the mountain at various places and disappeared in anger. Gautama could not bathe in her waters. Ganges then appeared in Gangadwar, Varaha-tirtha, Rama-Laxman tirtha, Ganga Sagar tirtha. Still Gautama could not bathe in her waters. The Gautama surrounded the river with enchanted grass and put a vow to her. The flow stopped there and the tirtha thus came to be called Kushavarta. It is from this Kushavarta that the river Godavari flows up to the sea. The sin of killing a cow by Gautama was wiped off here. Pujas performed here This place is famous for a number of Hindu religious rituals (vidhis). Narayan nagbali, Kalsarpa Shanti, Tripindi vidhi etc. are done here. Narayan Nagbali puja is unique to Trimbakeshwar. This puja is performed for three days. This puja is performed on special dates (muhurt). Some days in the year are not suitable to perform this puja. This puja is performed for many reasons like to cure an illness, going through bad times, killing a Cobra (Nag), childless couples, financial crisis or you want to perform some religious puja to have a peaceful & happy life to you and your family members. Accommodation There are many small and big Hotels in Trimbakeshwar city. Some of them are Hotel Sahyadri, Hotel Krushna Inn, Hotel Dhruv Palace, Hotel Sanskruti Holiday Resort, Shubham Water World, Sai Krupa Hotel Kaka, Hotel Sai Yatri.

It is owned by the Marr Trust and is operated by South Ayrshire Council which was transferred to then Strathclyde Regional Council in 1975, with South Ayrshire Council being responsible for providing the educational provisional provided by the school.https://www.south- ayrshire.gov.uk/documents/marr%20college%20-%20outcome%20of%20informal%20consultation.pdf The school was gifted to the town of Troon by Charles Kerr Marr. Throughout 2016-2017, it underwent extensive restoration works including a new build extending on from the original school building. As of 2017, 903 pupils currently attend Marr College.https://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/schools/pupil- rolls/actual%20school%20rolls%202017%202018.pdf History Marr College was built and established using the money left from Charles Kerr Marr, a native of Troon who believed that people should be educated together, no matter their background and levels of wealth. The creation of Marr College has long been regarded as the model that paved the way for state comprehensive schools as this was created long before the establishment of state comprehensive schools became a political ambition. Whilst at first the school was run by a board of governors, it still provided free education in a traditional Scottish manner. Pupils from all areas of Troon attended the school despite their backgrounds. Marr College lost its anomalous direct-grant status in 1978 and became a Strathclyde Region run school. When Strathclyde was abolished in 1996, the newly formed South Ayrshire Council took over the responsibility of the school, delegating much responsibility to the school's Head Teacher. Whilst much of the original building remains standing and intact, much of the building had fallen into a state to disrepair. Throughout 2016-2017, the school underwent a substantial period of renovation and new building blocks undertaken by South Ayrshire Council to improve the educational facilities and learning environments to bring the build up to date with other newly built schools in the area and to improve educational outcomes for the pupils. The improved updates, estimated at a cost of ¬£37 million (in 2017 terms), has seen new facilities added to the existing Marr College estate such as a new sports hall, new teaching wing and improved landscaping around the school estate. At present, the current roll of Marr College is 921 pupils as of July 2017 which is expected to rise to 1350.http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local- news/transformation-troons-historical-marr-college-9722064 Refurbishment and extension The official opening of the new extension and modernisation of Marr College, November 2017 The condition of the Marr College building has been well known and a matter of concern to South Ayrshire Council. In 2001, Marr College was included on a list of schools within South Ayrshire for consideration to be included on the Public Private Partnership bid to South Ayrshire Council ‚Äì a bid which would have seen an entirely new state of the art school estate constructed. Due to community issues such as disagreements on which proposal would represent best value to the community, the bid could not proceed. In 2008, Turner Townsend commissioned a report entitled Fit for Purpose which highlighted a serious number of concerns in terms of the condition of the current buildings which make up the Marr College campus. Many members of the Troon community believed that the issues relating to the condition of the Marr College estate was due to negligence and neglect on South Ayrshire Council's part. In response, a council representative issued a statement that South Ayrshire Council, for as far as their budget has allowed, has maintained the original Marr College building which has seen a number of improvements including upgraded roofing and new and more energy efficient window replacements. Whilst a new Marr College campus has not been constructed, there have long been concerns from members of the Troon community and parents with children attending the school that the current school building is overcrowded. South Ayrshire Council acknowledge and agree on this point, but highlighted that when South Ayrshire (then Strathclyde Regional Council) took over Marr College in 1975, the increase in pupil roll was addressed by implementing hut classrooms and extending parts of the school to meet the needs of the local community. On 29 November 2017 the ¬£37 million new extension of Marr College was officially opened by John Swinney, Deputy First Minister of Scotland and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills. The work was completed as part of a ¬£94 million pipeline of works being delivered across South Ayrshire school estates.https://www.south- ayrshire.gov.uk/news/landmark-marr-college-fit-for-the-future-after-extensive- modernisation.aspx Management team As of 2017, the management team at Marr College consists of one head teacher, four depute head teachers and several principal teachers of individual subjects and principal teachers of guidance.

Hamilton. Plot introduction A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable, the title heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus, also known as Merry Gentry. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court. While her aunt tried to kill her as a child, she has since offered her the title as crown princess as the Court needs more heirs. Plot summary A Caress of Twilight begins a few months after the events of A Kiss of Shadows. It is December, and Merry and the Sidhe warriors she has chosen as her lovers have returned to Los Angeles, California. Merry has resumed working for the Grey Detective Agency and several of the Sidhe have also joined the payroll. Merry is approached by Maeve Reed, previously known as Conchenn before her exile from the Seelie Court and now a famous Hollywood actress. Maeve asks Merry to perform a fertility rite that will permit her to have a child by her dying human husband. In return, she tells the princess that the reason for her exile was that she had refused to become the wife of Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, because she believed he was sterile. Galen, badly injured by the demi-fey during A Kiss of Shadows, has yet to heal, despite the usually phenomenal healing abilities of a sidhe warrior. Merry approaches the Queen of the Demi-Fey, Niceven, regarding a cure. The price of the cure and an alliance is a weekly drink of Merry's blood by a surrogate to be chosen by Niceven. During Merry's first night in bed with Doyle, they are interrupted by Andais who reveals that the Nameless has been freed. The worst of both courts, the Nameless was the last great spell that Seelie and Unseelie had cooperated upon. They had stripped themselves of everything too awful for them to be permitted to stay in the United States, and from it had been formed the Nameless. A strange murder brings members of the Grey Agency, including Merry, to the scene. However, their presence is challenged by others of the police force and they are thrown off site. However, this is not before they have a chance to suspect that supernatural forces are at work. It is suspected that the lives had been sucked from the murder victims by the ghosts of dead gods. Nothing is said to the police, however, as the only known person to work such a spell was a sidhe and, if it were discovered, that fact could result in all sidhe being banished from the country. Healed from his injuries by Niceven's representative, Sage, Galen acts the part of the Green Man in the fertility ritual with Merry which results in Maeve Reed becoming pregnant. It begins to become clear that Taranis is also planning something as various social secretaries insist upon Merry attending first the Yule Ball and then a feast in her honour. This culminates in a conversation between Merry and Taranis himself. Finally, the Nameless attacks Maeve Reed's home. It is finally defeated by Merry and her companions, Merry herself showing for the first time her second Hand of Power - the Hand of Blood. The result of the destruction of the Nameless is the release of the magics which formed it; these magics transfer themselves to the victors, who begin to exhibit unforeseen side effects.

They were introduced by Marcel Riesz in 1911 as an improvement over the Ces√†ro mean. The Riesz mean should not be confused with the Bochner‚ÄìRiesz mean or the Strong‚ÄìRiesz mean. Definition Given a series \\\\\\\\{s_n\\\\\\\\}, the Riesz mean of the series is defined by :s^\\\\delta(\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_{n\\\\le \\\\lambda} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{n}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^\\\\delta s_n Sometimes, a generalized Riesz mean is defined as :R_n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_n} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (\\\\lambda_k-\\\\lambda_{k-1})^\\\\delta s_k Here, the \\\\lambda_n are a sequence with \\\\lambda_n\\\\to\\\\infty and with \\\\lambda_{n+1}/\\\\lambda_n\\\\to 1 as n\\\\to\\\\infty. Other than this, the \\\\lambda_n are taken as arbitrary. Riesz means are often used to explore the summability of sequences; typical summability theorems discuss the case of s_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k for some sequence \\\\\\\\{a_k\\\\\\\\}. Typically, a sequence is summable when the limit \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} R_n exists, or the limit \\\\lim_{\\\\delta\\\\to 1,\\\\lambda\\\\to\\\\infty}s^\\\\delta(\\\\lambda) exists, although the precise summability theorems in question often impose additional conditions. Special cases Let a_n=1 for all n. Then : \\\\sum_{n\\\\le \\\\lambda} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{n}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^\\\\delta = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{c-i\\\\infty}^{c+i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta)\\\\Gamma(s)}{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta+s)} \\\\zeta(s) \\\\lambda^s \\\\, ds = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1+\\\\delta} + \\\\sum_n b_n \\\\lambda^{-n}.

The power series :\\\\sum_n b_n \\\\lambda^{-n} can be shown to be convergent for \\\\lambda > 1. Note that the integral is of the form of an inverse Mellin transform. Another interesting case connected with number theory arises by taking a_n=\\\\Lambda(n) where \\\\Lambda(n) is the Von Mangoldt function. Then : \\\\sum_{n\\\\le \\\\lambda} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{n}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^\\\\delta \\\\Lambda(n) = - \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{c-i\\\\infty}^{c+i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta)\\\\Gamma(s)}{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta+s)} \\\\frac{\\\\zeta^\\\\prime(s)}{\\\\zeta(s)} \\\\lambda^s \\\\, ds = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1+\\\\delta} + \\\\sum_\\\\rho \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta)\\\\Gamma(\\\\rho)}{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\delta+\\\\rho)} +\\\\sum_n c_n \\\\lambda^{-n}.

Synopsis Prince Hyacinth is born to a widowed Queen. He is a beautiful baby, except for his nose- the very largest ever seen. Unknown to either the Queen or any of her court, this giant nose had been foretold before his parents' marriage. Prince Hyacinth's father, the King, had sought the help of the Fairy to win the Princess when his courtship failed. Taking pity on the distraught suitor, she told him the secret of breaking the spell that prevented the Princess from marrying: step on the tail of the Princess' great cat. As soon as the King managed to get his foot squarely on the cat's tail, the animal transformed into an angry wizard, who tried to dampen the King's joy. \\"You will have a son who will be horribly unhappy\\", the enchanter taunted, \\"a Prince made miserable because he will not know of the enormity of his own nose\\". The King was more confounded than worried by this prediction. After all, how could anyone not know the appearance of his own nose? Sure enough, the prince grew to be a man with no idea that he had an unusual facial feature. From the moment of his birth, his mother and everyone at court went to great lengths to imply that the length of his nose was not only normal but desirable. Only children with extra-long noses were allowed to play with him, courtiers pulled on their own noses to make them appear longer, his history tutor took pains to describe any handsome or beautiful personage as having had a particularly long nose. When he became of age, Prince Hyacinth was shown a portrait of a dear little Princess. Falling in love with her instantly, he still had to admit that her nose was extremely small and tilted. His mother, pleased with the match, re-assured him that small noses are actually not considered so ugly in women. Ambassadors were sent to ask the neighboring King for the Dear Little Princess' hand in marriage. The sorcerer seizes the princess, as Prince Hyacinth watches. Illustration by Henry Justice Ford for Andrew Lang's The Blue Fairy Book (1889). Consent was given, and the joyful Prince travelled to meet her. As he approached, ready to kiss her hand, the Sorcerer appeared and whisked her away. The Prince ordered his entourage of courtiers to leave him and wandered, disconsolate. For the first time in his life, he was alone. He meets the Fairy, a little old woman who takes quite some time adjusting her spectacles to look him over. Her nose is too short to easily secure the glasses, and they repeatedly fall off. Regarding each other, each bursts into laughter. The Prince is stunned to find the Fairy thinks his nose is ridiculous. He sees that everyone flatters her and assumes they have deceived her into believing her tiny nose is not a fault. How foolish some people are, he thinks, not to see the reality of their own character. At dinner, which he is very glad to get, his hunger prompts him to put up with her repeated observations about the length of his nose. Finally, he asks her to stop mentioning his nose. She agrees, promising that she will not only stop talking about it, she will even try to believe he has an ordinary nose, though clearly it could make three reasonable sized ones. With that, the Prince has had enough and rides off. Everywhere he goes, searching for the Dear Little Princess, he meets people who claim that his nose is abnormally large. He thinks them all mad. The old Fairy, who had been so fond of his father, helps Prince Hyacinth. She shuts the Dear Little Princess in a crystal palace and places the palace where the Prince will find it. With great joy, he sets to work to free her, but cannot get through its walls. The Dear Little Princess extends her hand through a window for him to kiss it, but he cannot manage to get his lips past his nose to touch her hand, no matter how he turns or twists. For the first time, he realizes just how long that nose really is, too long! With that realization, the crystal palace shattered into splinters and the old Fairy presented the Dear Little Princess to him with the admonition, \\"You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects. We refuse to see them until we find them in the way of our interests.\\" Prince Hyacinth's nose shrinks down to a usual size and he marries the Dear Little Princess. The two live happily ever after.

Political and satirical activity Vovak claimed to be the youngest ever Republican candidate (31 years of age) to run for President of the United States when in 2003 he focused on the states of Iowa, Connecticut, Ohio, and Texas. After entering the contest against George W. Bush, Iowa's Governor Tom Vilsack jestfully labeled Vovak \\"an invader from the East\\" as Vovak, sporting his white wig, fired a question to the Governor during the Iowa Press Convention. Vovak ran on the campaign theme of \\"Small Ideas for America\\" and drove a truck he named \\"Air Ford One\\", making people laugh on the campaign trail as he criss-crossed various states. Vovak's presidential campaign essentially ended on January 11, 2004 when he was ejected from the final Democratic presidential debate. On January 19, he was defeated in the Iowa Caucus by the President. In July 2004, Vovak entered the U.S. Senate contest in Illinois, seeking the Republican nomination after Jack Ryan withdrew.

His ideas were border control, controlling judges, and canceling the White House's subscription to The New York Times. Vovak regularly wore a wig in his public appearances. According to his website, Vovak wore the wig because: # It is a clever idea to help movie audiences remember him, # It saves millions of dollars in advertisements with free media coverage, # It evokes the Whig Party roots of the Republican Party and its reliance on the founders' version of the United States Constitution.

It is the birthplace of Paola Ruffo di Calabria, Queen of the Belgians from 1993 to 2013. Tourism is the principal activity of Forte dei Marmi's citizens. The population of the town, amounting to some 7,700, nearly triples during the summer, because of the hundreds of tourists who mainly come from Florence, Milan, Germany, and Russia. Forte dei Marmi is one of the major destinations which attract the Italian upper class. The city contains a gate built in a former bog, a historical artifact that relates to strategic planning by the ancient Roman army. In Italian Forte dei Marmi means \\"Fort of the marbles\\". The town takes its name from the fortress that rises in the middle of the main square, built under Grand Duke Peter Leopold, who was to become Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1788. The fortress was built to defend the coast from outer attacks, but in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century it became the place where the marble quarried from the Alpi Apuane (they are the same mountains of the famous marble of Carrara) was stocked before being sent to the pier for shipping. Forte dei Marmi's field hockey team is in the Italian A-league. History During their expansion within the Italian territory, the Romans settled in Versilia. The army managed to overcome the people of Liguria in the 2nd century BC, under the skillful command of the proconsuls Publius Cornelius Cethegus and Marcus Baebius Tamphilus. The whole territory was centuriated to create new settlements for the colonies coming from Luni and Lucca. The silver lead and iron mines were exploited and the area became a strong economic resource. Between Querceta (Serravezza) and the Vaiana area, where Forte dei Marmi is currently located, there was a road that represented one of the axes of the Roman land centuriation (This road was later called \\"Via delle mordure\\", and to this day it bears this name). Vaiana is mentioned in a document from 794 AD that registers the sale of a piece of land then called \\"Vaiano\\", where it was later discovered that there were springs that contributed to the waterlogging of the nearby countrysides. In 1515 the marble quarries of the Versilian municipalities were donated to the Medici family; consequently new quarries were opened and a new road was laid out to bring the marble blocks down to the sea, where a pier was built. In the mid-17th century, the Medici government decided to divert the flow of the river Versilia, to avoid the flooding of the town of Pietrasanta. A new course was laid so that the waters of the Versilia would overflow naturally in the swamps of lake Porta. This meant that the territories of Querceta and Vaiana had to be cut out of the river's trajectory. At about 1,500 meters, the river Versilia's new path crossed a road wanted and planned by Michelangelo, so a wooden bridge was built (this bridge was called \\"Ponte delle Tavole\\": \\"bridge made out of wooden planks\\"). Throughout the years, other canals were built and the area was reclaimed. The road became more and more important for the marble transportation. The first stable settlement on the coast was called Caranna; it was not far from the watersprings of Vaiana. Later on, other settlements were built in what now is the current Forte dei Marmi city centre. Initially, the area was called \\"Magazzino del Ferro\\" (The Iron deposit) or \\"Magazzino della Magona\\" or \\"Magazzino dei Marmi\\" ( The Marble deposit) because of the only building on the seashore. The whole district was also known as \\"Marina\\"; the county road that went from Querceta to the sea is to this day known as \\"Provinciale di Marina\\" (Marina county road). In 1788 the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Peter Leopold II, commissioned the construction of a fort, the Forte Lorense, to defend the marble shipments and promote the territory. It was similar to the forts of Marina di Castagneto and Marina di Bibbona on the Maremman seaside. The fort was completed on 6 February 1788. It was a defense point against pirate raids and it was also used as a deposit for the marble that came from the Apuane mountains to be shipped out to sea. Thus, the area began to be known as Forte dei Marmi (The Fortress of Marble). In 1833 the Grand Ducal Government asked engineer Giovanni Franchi to reconstruct the Ponte delle Tavole (The bridge was destroyed in 1944, during the nazi invasion of Italy. It was later rebuilt in bricks). In the meantime, the town of Forte dei Marmi was considered part of the municipality of Pietrasanta at the Unification of Italy in 1861. The touristic development at the beginning of the 20th century led to the birth of a city committee that asked for the detachment from Pietrasanta and planned on joining the town of Serravezza or on affirming its own independence. With the political support of Giovanni Montauti from Lucca, sponsored by the counts Siemens-Schuckert who owned most of the territory, Forte dei Marmi declared its autonomy as a separate comune on 26 April 1914. Tourism Tourism in Forte dei Marmi started at the end of the 18th century when the rich families of the inland went to the coast to breathe healthy air and to sandbathe. At the beginning of the 19th century many wealthy families from Tuscany and the north of Italy started to choose this town for their summer holidays. Later on, also European families started to do so. Many notable people started to arrive in the area and the first villas were built in the pinewood near the sea. The first ones were Agnelli, Siemens, Giovanni Gentile, Thomas Mann, Renato Fucini, Italo Balbo, Curzio Malaparte, Enrico Pea, Aldous Huxley, Guglielmo Marconi, the writer Riccardo Bacchelli, the sculptor Henry Moore, Luchino Visconti and many Italian noble families. Artists meeting every day talking about arts and culture created a group called Quarto Platano. The Grand Hotel in Forte became an important place for the European high society and the hotel was chosen also from the Belgian royal family. Tourism increased after the Second World War, especially in the Sixties when more and more families love spending their summer and this lovely paradise. Many houses and hotels were built near the sea. In 1991 hotels were 101, most of them open only during the summer and some of them family-run businesses. Today the area is still a destination for businessmen, managers, politicians, show-men, movie and sport stars. It is still a town immersed in the pinewood with a sandy beach. The number of hotels decreased from 101 in 1991 to 58 hotels today. However, the number of people that have bought vacation houses here has increased. Many of the area's hotels have been renovated and are now apartments, private villas or three and four star hotels. Today, the 58 hotels have a total of 1.965 rooms. In 2010 in Forte dei Marmi 109.379 tourists spend an average of 3.9 nights for a total of 428.352 visits. The total visits were 423.250 in 2009 and 450.800 in 2008. In 2010, 49% were foreign tourists, in 2009 45% and in 2008 46%. The majority of Italian tourists come from Tuscany, then Lombardia, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna e the fifth region is Lazio.

Benito was introduced along with his wife and two sons, following the announcement of several cast departures. Spartels was glad to bring something different to the show as part of the first ethnic family. He thought the introduction of the Alessis showed viewers \\"a broader picture\\" of Australia, after the show was criticised for not accurately representing suburban life. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 28 July 1992. Benito was described as being \\"typically Italian\\" by writer Josephine Monroe. He wants his sons to excel in everything they do, but is left disappointed. The character has a comedic rivalry with business partner Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), which Spartels enjoyed playing. Benito and Cathy's marriage is tested by her desire to have another child, Benito's secret vasectomy and the revelation that they had a daughter, who was given up for adoption. Spartels chose to leave the serial to record a children's music album and his final scenes aired on 28 May 1993. Casting Benito and his wife Cathy Alessi (Elspeth Ballantyne) were introduced in July 1992, shortly after their sons Marco Alessi (Felice Arena) and Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon). The family's introduction followed the announced departures of several regular characters. They were the first \\"truly ethnic family group\\" to be introduced into the cast, and were given immediate links within the series as relations of sisters Caroline Alessi (Gillian Blakeney) and Christina Alessi (Gayle Blakeney). Spartels relished the challenge of portraying a member of the Alessi family, explaining \\"Being half Greek myself ‚Äì and knowing lots of Italians and Greeks ‚Äì I thought it was interesting to bring a different flavour to the show.\\" He also believed the introduction of the Alessis was \\"a sign of maturity\\" and a chance for viewers to see \\"a broader picture\\" of Australia, after the show was criticised for not representing suburban life as it was at the time. Development Writing in the Neighbours Programme Guide, author Josephine Monroe said Benito was a second generation Italian immigrant.Monroe 1994, p.35. He is \\"typically Italian\\" and wants his sons to excel in everything they do, however, after realising that Marco will always be a drifter, Benito invests more in his younger son. Benito is disappointed when Rick proves that he is not academically gifted and Benito is further shamed when Rick is expelled from his boarding school. Producers established a rivalry between Benito and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) when they go into business together selling cars. Monroe observed: \\"The two men's sales styles clashed badly! Benito disapproved of Lou's sleazy ocker pitch, and Lou thought Benito was too gentlemanly to sell beers to a drunk!\\"Monroe 1994, p.43. Spartels picked Benito and Lou's comedic rivalry as one of his favourite storylines, along with Benito's secretary Gaby Willis' (Rachel Blakely) reinvention as a \\"wild-haired rock chick\\". Benito and Cathy's marriage is tested by her desire to have another child, forcing Benito to reveal that he had had a vasectomy years earlier.Monroe 1994, p.36. Spartels called the storyline \\"unforgettable\\". He said that he did not have to research it too much, as it was a subject he was uncomfortable about, which made it \\"unnerving\\" to act out on-screen. The couple's fictional backstory was then explored when it emerged that Cathy had given birth to a daughter when they were sixteen. As they came from respectable families, Cathy and Benito were forced to give the baby up for adoption. Producers soon introduced the couple's daughter Lindsay Steiner (Jane Longhurst), leading to arguments with Marco, who always thought he was Cathy's oldest child. Arena said the scenes involved \\"lots of shouting and slamming of doors\\". Benito, Cathy and Marco were only on the show for a year. The characters were not written out. Spartels had been a presenter on Play School prior to joining Neighbours, so when he was offered the chance to record a children's music album, he had to choose between leaving the show or recording the album. Spartels decided to leave Neighbours, which he admitted he was sad about, as he felt his character was \\"hitting his stride\\". Spartels did not regret his decision to leave, as it led to a successful music career, but he found that he missed Neighbours. He added that if he was offered a role in a soap opera again, he would accept it.

Benito is furious when he finds out what the Duncan brothers are going to show the businessmen, but he is happy when he lands the account. Reception The character's profile on BBC Online states that his most notable moment was \\"Admitting to Cathy that he'd had a vasectomy without her knowledge.\\" Writer Josephine Monroe thought the \\"childishness\\" between Benito and Lou was \\"hilarious\\". Jason Herbison of Inside Soap commented that Spartels \\"brought a welcome bit of Greek flavour to Ramsay Street\\", while the Alessi family \\"added much-needed spice\\" to the show. Writing in Small Screens ‚Äì Essays on Contemporary Australian Television, David Nichols found Benito's persona was similar to the angry, ethnic father trope, calling him \\"an easily angered patriarch in conflict with what were presented as everyday 'Australian' mores\\".

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 29 July 1992 and remained until her departure on 4 August 1993. Casting The Alessi family were introduced in 1992 following the announced departures of several regular characters. The family were the first \\"truly ethnic\\" group to be introduced into the cast. Following her stint as Meg Morris in Prisoner, Ballantyne took eight years off television to concentrate on theatre work. She then received the role of Cathy Alessi and revealed she could not turn it down. Ballantyne told David Nicholls of Inside Soap \\"I had a wry smile on my face when I read about the character of Cathy Alessi. She has two teenage sons, one just out of school and one still in school, and that's a very similar situation to my own.\\" Ballantyne's character became popular with viewers in Australia and the actress said Cathy had some good storylines coming up, so she hoped she would become as popular as Meg. Within a year, the entire Alessi family had left, leaving only Rick (Dan Falzon) behind. Development When Cathy became broody around Phoebe Bright (Simone Robertson) and decided to try for another baby, it emerged that she had once had a child adopted out. Cathy conceived while she was dating her future husband Benito (George Spartels). She gave birth to a daughter shortly after her 16th birthday. The news shocked Cathy's son, Marco (Felice Arena), who had always thought he was the oldest. He was also hurt because he considered his mother to be his best friend. Marco decided to embark on a search for his sister and the adoption agency tracked her down, but she did not want to make contact with the family. Cathy and Benito believed that the matter was at an end, but a young woman began following Marco and later revealed herself to be his sister, Lindsay (Jane Longhurst). While Marco was pleased to meet Lindsay, she was angry and accused him of ruining her life. Cathy and Benito later came face-to-face with Lindsay. Arena enjoyed filming the storyline and praised Ballantyne and Spartels. Storylines Cathy and her husband, Benito, move into Number 22 Ramsay Street, after they are left it by Benito's niece, Christina (Gayle Blakeney), and her husband. Cathy takes over the Coffee Shop lease from Madge Bishop (Anne Charleston) and employs a pregnant Phoebe Bright to help out. Phoebe's pregnancy causes Cathy to reminisce about the daughter she gave up for adoption. She tells Benito that she wants to try for a baby. Benito is initially against the idea as he had a vasectomy after their youngest son, Rick, was born. However, he decides to get it reversed. Cathy is devastated to learn from the doctors that she is not able to carry a child to full term due to her age. Phoebe asks Cathy to be godmother to her daughter, Hope. Cathy's spaghetti sauce recipe catches the eye of a sauce manufacturer and they ask Cathy to sell the ingredients to them. She initially refuses to consider the offer as the recipe had been passed down from Mama Alessi in Italy. The manufacturer also wants to add extra flavourings, which Cathy believes would ruin the taste, but she agrees to the deal as the money is too good to turn down. Cathy's son's Marco and Rick are told about their sister and Marco finds her. Lindsay agrees to meet Cathy and Benito, but only if Marco does not tell them she is their daughter. He brings her to the house and Cathy and Benito believe she is Marco's girlfriend. They are shocked when Marco reveals that Lindsay is their daughter. Cathy meets Lindsey, but she becomes upset when Lindsay tells her that she wants to get on with her life. Cathy gives her some knitted booties that she had kept and Lindsay agrees to keep in touch. Benito is offered a job in Sydney and Cathy leaves the Coffee Shop in the hands of Phoebe and her husband, Stephen (Lochie Daddo). Cathy is not happy that Rick wants to stay behind, but she gives him her blessing. When Phoebe and Stephen leave town, Rick takes over the Coffee Shop until Cathy comes back to terminate the lease. Cathy tries to persuade Rick to come to Sydney with her, but she eventually arranges for Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) to take Rick in. Reception A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said that Cathy's most notable moment was \\"Meeting her adopted daughter.\\" Inside Soap's Josephine Monroe branded Cathy \\"supermum\\". Robin Oliver of The Sydney Morning Herald used Cathy coming to terms with her infertility as an example of Neighbours becoming more \\"moralistic\\".

In high school and college he was known for his strong offense, while his quick and agile moves to the basket drew comparisons to the likes of Dominique Wilkins. A Parade Magazine and McDonald's All-American standout at Griffin High School in Griffin, Georgia, Hancock was ranked among the country's best high school basketball players in the late 1980s. He played his first two college seasons at Garden City Community College, where he was considered one of the top junior college recruits in the nation before transferring to the University of Kansas. There he was the starting small forward on the Kansas Jayhawks' Final Four-bound squad in the 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Hancock left college after his junior year to play professional basketball and eventually found success in United States semi-pro basketball leagues after several uneventful stints in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is considered to be among the best all-time Georgia high school basketball players in the state's history. Early life Darrin Hancock was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama but relocated to the small community of Griffin, Georgia, south of Atlanta in Spalding County, when he was in sixth grade. Hancock suffered tragedy at a young age in 1978 when his father died after succumbing to a heart attack and thereafter was raised by his mother. As a child, he kept to himself and only picked up playing basketball in the eighth grade. Hancock credited James Martin, the Griffin High School basketball coach, as his most positive influence other than his mother. Martin was his coach and mentor in high school and frequently advised Hancock on professional and personal affairs. The young Hancock eventually came to look at Martin as a father figure and the coach later became his legal guardian. High school career The young Alabama native attended Griffin High School where his considerably tall height of 6'6\\" and athletic talent helped land him the role of starting center on his school's varsity basketball squad during his freshman year. Hancock instantly emerged as the star of the team and was considered as one of the state's top freshman high school basketball players during the 1986‚Äì87 season. He managed to lead the 25‚Äì2 Griffin Bears in points and rebounds as well as helping his number two ranked school seize the state's Region 6-AAAA championship title, all the while before completing his freshman year. The Griffin Bears continued to flourish with Hancock, as the now number one ranked basketball squad posted a 28‚Äì1 record and claimed their second Region 6-AAAA title during the 1987‚Äì88 season. Darrin Hancock finished the season averaging 17 points per game while earning the distinct honor of being the first sophomore to be named as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution state Player of the Year. He was not only considered one of the state's premier underclassmen, but was also rated as the number one sophomore basketball player in the nation by B.C. Scouting Service during his second year in high school. Griffin High School began the 1988‚Äì89 season in a new basketball class, the 4-AAAA South region, but were unable to replicate their recent success. The team struggled to adjust to the new class and dropped to a sixth-place ranking with a 19‚Äì5 record. However, Hancock continued to achieve individual success, including being named to the 1988‚Äì89 Parade Magazine All-American First Team and finishing third in votes for the magazine's National Player of the Year award. He was additionally considered as one of the nation's top five high school players by several national surveys upon entering his senior year in school. Hancock and the Bears finally managed to break into the 4-AAAA South region after their relative lapse during their previous season. The team obtained the number one ranking in their new class and finished with an impressive 26‚Äì4 record before losing to Southwest Macon High School in the state's Class 4-AAAA state quarterfinals. Hancock, who recently had also begun playing in the Forward (basketball)forward position, displayed what would be considered his best single-game high school performance that season when he scored 50 points and nailed the match's game-winning three-pointer in a double-overtime victory against Vanguard High School of Ocala, Florida.WKEU Radio Story on Hancock The All-American averaged 30 points and nine rebounds a game at the close of the 1989‚Äì90 season. Darrin Hancock, considered to be one of the nation's top senior high school basketball players at the time, was a highly sought after prize by many college basketball programs. The All-American eventually signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) in the spring of 1990 but was ultimately disqualified from accepting an NCAA Division I scholarship (under Proposition 48 guidelines) because of his grade point average. Unable to enroll at UNLV as a college freshman, Hancock instead opted to enroll at Garden City Community College in southwest Kansas, where he could officially become eligible to transfer to another university after completing his coursework. College career Garden City College Darrin Hancock relocated from his Georgia home to the Midwest and settled in rural Finney County, Kansas in 1990 to begin his enrollment at Garden City Community College. He joined Garden City's basketball squad as the team's star swingman and averaged 17.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.7 steals during his freshman season. His continued athletic accomplishments earned him his third consecutive Parade Magazine All-American recognition as well as being named to the JUCO All-American Third Team. The Georgia transplant further expanded his prowess on the court during his college sophomore season and averaged 21.8 points per game and 11.7 rebounds per game. Hancock displayed his top single- game college performance when he recorded a triple-double against Barton County Community College, scoring a then-collegiate career high of 37 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists and three steals. Many considered Hancock to be the nation's number one junior college basketball player, including the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), who named the sophomore star as the 1991‚Äì92 NJCCA Player of the Year. Hancock also captured the attention of the nearby University of Kansas, whose powerhouse basketball program successfully persuaded him to become a Jayhawk for the upcoming 1992‚Äì93 season on an athletic scholarship. Kansas Hancock transferred to the University of Kansas where he was tapped to start as the basketball team's starting small forward. News of Hancock's addition to the Kansas Jayhawks' basketball squad created quite a buzz and even prompted Jayhawks' coach Roy Williams to state that, \\"Darrin is one of the best athletes in the nation [a]nd he will be one of the best athletes ever to put on a Kansas uniform.\\" Several hoops analysts forecasted Kansas as a top-ranked team and as a possible Final Four contender with the arrival of Hancock. The Jayhawks fulfilled those predictions, capturing the 1993 Big Eight Regular Season Championship and the second seed in the Midwest division of the 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a 27‚Äì8 record. The Jayhawks marched through the NCAA tournament and arrived at the Final Four Regional Championships, their second appearance in three years. Though Kansas eventually lost to North Carolina in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one. The dynamic backcourt duo of Rex Walters and Adonis Jordan provided the bulk of the Jayhawks' scoring. Hancock, on the other hand, was primarily a secondary offensive contributor with an average of 7.5 points per game in 33 starts. Hancock's failure to live up to pre-season expectations appeared to have been a result of not adapting well to Kansas' style of play. In July 1993 he abruptly left the university after undisclosed personal issues forced the Jayhawk small forward to miss required summer school coursework and thus become academically ineligible to play on the team. Hancock transferred to Indiana State University in September but had a change of heart after one month, choosing instead to pursue a professional career in Europe. Professional career Charlotte Hornets The former Jayhawk spent his first season as a pro playing in the French Pro B League for the Maurienne basketball club, where he averaged 17.3 points and 5.4 rebounds over 17 games. Back in the United States, players and teams were prepping for the upcoming 1994 NBA draft. Hancock attended the Chicago pre-draft camp over the summer where he showcased his trademark agility to NBA scouts. The Charlotte Hornets, who earlier packaged away their first-round pick as part of the Hersey Hawkins-Kendall Gill trade, were busy deciding whom to choose for their sole 2nd-round pick. The organization sought out either a rebounding-prone rookie with height or a backup point guard. However, many of Charlotte's rookie prospects were already selected by time it was their turn; and therefore the Hornets tapped Hancock with the 38th overall pick of the draft after he impressed the organization with athleticism that complimented the team's running game style of play. The young rookie earned the final open slot on Charlotte's 12-man roster after displaying his skills at the NBA summer league over the off-season. Hancock joined a veteran-heavy team that was led by the young powerhouse combination of Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning. Hancock's own talents were outmatched by many of his teammates, compromising his minutes on the court as the Hornets' 12th man. Nonetheless, he saw significant playing time in April 1995 when Charlotte's starting small forward Scott Burrell and backup small forward David Wingate were simultaneously out with injuries. Hancock recorded a then NBA career high of 15 points that same month against the Philadelphia 76ers in one of his seven starts that season. As a team, the Hornets enjoyed success with their best regular season record in franchise history (50‚Äì32) while finishing second in the Central Division. Charlotte returned to the NBA playoffs for the second time in three years before suffering a loss against the Chicago Bulls in the first round. Hancock saw limited playing time in his NBA Playoffs debut as the Hornets shifted players around in order to keep a big lineup against the Chicago Bulls. Nonetheless the Hornet's rookie contributed in the post-season action, though sparingly, playing less than 10 minutes in three games. Hancock spent the 1995 summer off-season working on expanding his offensive prowess, which appeared to have some effect on his game during a surprising pre-season start where he averaged 15.5 points over six exhibition games. Starter Scott Burrell entered the season on the injured list nursing a torn Achilles tendon, forcing the newly acquired shooting guard Glen Rice to switch positions and replace Burrell as the squad's starting small forward. Charlotte took a chance with tapping Hancock to temporarily fill the void at the starting shooting guard position in the meantime. He appeared in four starts during the middle of November, averaging five points and two rebounds. However, Burrell returned to the starting lineup later in the month, relegating Hancock back to the bench. Darrin Hancock saw limited playing time in about half of all regular season games through the end of December but recorded an NBA career high of 16 points during an away game against the Utah Jazz. The now second-year NBA swingman began to see a dramatic increase in playing time after Burrell suffered a season-ending dislocated shoulder on New Year's Eve. This time around Charlotte went with Dell Curry as the team's new replacement starting shooting guard, designating Hancock as the Hornets' primary guard-forward swingman reserve. Hancock finished the season with a total average of 13.3 minutes per game in 63 games. Despite seeing more time on the court, Hancock was unable to carry over his pre-season offensive exploits into the regular season and settled instead for a 4.3 points per game average. The Charlotte Hornets, playing their first year without star Alonzo Mourning, had also seen better times after failing to make the playoffs with a 41‚Äì41 record. The Hornets decided not to re-sign Hancock at the end of his two-year contract, making the former Hornet a marketable free agent soon thereafter. Bucks‚ÄìHawks‚ÄìSpurs Darrin Hancock was signed by the Milwaukee Bucks on October 3, 1996 and his strong defensive front court presence helped the former Hornet survive the team's off-season cuts. He averaged 4.8 points and 14.8 minutes in six pre- season contests and eventually made the team's roster for the start of the 1996‚Äì97 season. However, Milwaukee head coach Chris Ford struggled to work Hancock into his playbook and as a result the newly acquired Buck saw scarce minutes on the floor, averaging 4.3 minutes per game as small forward reserve. He was traded along with a conditional second-round draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Chucky Brown after playing in only nine games for Milwaukee. Hancock remained inactive on the Suns' injured list with bruised knees and was waived a week later on December 11, 1996. However, Hancock's future soon looked promising when Tyrone Corbin, the Atlanta Hawks' starting small forward, went down with a sprained left ankle in late December. The organization took interest in the native Georgian, who was looking to rebound back into the league after having recently been dropped by the Suns. Hancock, who at the time was conveniently residing in Atlanta, accepted his hometown team's eventual offer. The Hawks signed Henry James and later added Hancock on January 2, 1997, handing Corbin's starting role over to James while assigning Hancock as the team's backup small forward. However, Darrin Hancock only saw scarce time on the court during his stay with Atlanta, playing a total of 10 minutes in two games. Just five days after joining the Hawks, the team released Hancock in order to re-activate Tyrone Corbin from the injured list. However, the dismissal did not prevent Hancock from returning to the court. He soon found an opportunity to in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) when the Omaha Racers offered Hancock a deal to play for the team in late January. Hancock averaged 14 points and 3.5 rebounds in his first two games with the Racers. Hancock departed the CBA soon thereafter and found his way back into the big leagues on a 10-day contract with the San Antonio Spurs on January 29, 1997, joining his fifth NBA team in three seasons. Hancock donned a Spurs uniform for only eight minutes during a road game against the Philadelphia 76ers before San Antonio decided against re-signing his 10-day contract in favor for re-signing teammate Jamie Feick. Hancock was offered a 10-day contract in March to return to Atlanta, where he finished the remainder of season as a Hawk. Personal Darrin Hancock is married to Kathleen Hancock. Darrin and Kathleen met while he was at GCCC. The two finally married in 2011.

He earned six caps for the Dutch national team, scoring two goals. Career Club De Wolf was born in Schiedam. He began his professional career with Sparta Rotterdam, making his senior debut in 1983. After two seasons in the team, he departed for FC Groningen where he continued to impress and won a call-up to the Dutch national team in 1987. The defender moved on to Feyenoord in 1989 and after a season outside their first team, he settled into the side and won the Dutch league championship in 1992‚Äì93 with the club. He also won three Dutch Cups during a stay of four full seasons and made it to the 91‚Äì92 Cup Winners' Cup semi-final, which they lost on away goals against Monaco. He left for English First Division (second tier) side Wolverhampton Wanderers in December 1994 for ¬£600,000. He was swiftly made captain of the side by manager Graham Taylor, and helped them reach the FA Cup quarter-finals, as well as remarkably scoring a hat-trick from centre-back in one game against Port Vale. However, he soon suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of the promotion run-in, where the team would ultimately lose to Bolton in the play-offs. The following season, however, he missed most games as Wolves finished a lowly 20th in the final table. The Dutchman fell out with new manager Mark McGhee who attempted to select him for the reserve side, only for De Wolf to speak out and claim that he should not be fielded in the reserves as he was an experienced player who had not been injured. He left the club soon afterwards and returned to his homeland with VVV-Venlo of the second division. After a solitary season back in his native land with VVV, he once again moved abroad, joining Israeli side Hapoel Ashkelon in 1997. He failed to adapt though and made only three appearances ‚Äì scoring an own goal in his final game ‚Äì before quickly returning to Dutch football with Helmond Sport in the second flight. He had a strained personal relationship with the club, though, and both parties agreed to terminate his contract during his second season. De Wolf instead ended the campaign with a short spell as player-manager of amateur side Zwart-Wit '28. International De Wolf made his debut for the Netherlands on 16 December 1987 in a 3‚Äì0 win in Greece during their Euro '88 qualifying campaign. After this substitute appearance though, he was not chosen again for over five years. He returned to contention under managerialship of Dick Advocaat and won five further caps during 1993‚Äì94. He scored two international goals during a 6‚Äì0 thrashing of San Marino in March 1993 and was subsequently chosen for the squad for the 1994 World Cup, however he did not feature in any of the games. His final cap came on 13 October 1993 in a 2‚Äì0 win against England that effectively ended both their hopes of qualifying and Graham Taylor's reign as manager. Ironically, it would be Taylor who would next sign de Wolf in his club career (for Wolves). Managerial He retired from playing in 2000, and joined RKSV Halsteren as trainer. He has been manager of three different sides since ‚Äì SVVSMC, VV Haaglandia and FC T√ºrkiyemspor. He left the latter in February 2008. In February 2009 de Wolf became the manager of Voorschoten '97.

Hamilton, the first book in the Merry Gentry series. Plot introduction A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also popular, the heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court, however having fled the court three years before she has been hiding herself under the name of Merry Gentry and working as a private investigator for the Grey Detective Agency. Plot summary The story begins in Los Angeles, California, in a world where magical creatures are \\"out of the closet\\" and, in some cases, even legal. Princess Meredith NicEssus is working for the Grey Detective Agency under the assumed name of Meredith 'Merry' Gentry. When two women come to the agency with a story about fey-wannabes and rituals involving fey women, Merry goes undercover to investigate. However, she and her colleagues get more than they bargained for when it is discovered that the culprit is using Branwyn's Tears, an illegal oil that can make a human appear as a sidhe (pronounced 'shee') lover for a night, and turn even a sidhe or a sidhe-descendant into his sexual slave. In the process of solving the case, Merry's secret is revealed, and she is hunted by the demonic Sluagh. Brought to see their King, Sholto, he offers Meredith a deal. Himself disapproved of by Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, because of his mixed blood, he proposes an alliance between the two of them. Jealous at the idea of Merry becoming his lover, Sholto's harem of nighthags attack Merry. During the fight Merry's gift, the Hand of Flesh, is revealed when one of them, Nerys, turns into a ball of flesh. Shocked, Merry tries to flee, but is trapped. Doyle, Captain of the Queen's Raven Guard, appears. He announces that the Queen never sent the Sluagh, and that in fact the Queen meant her no harm. As proof of this he produces the Queen's sword Mortal Dread, as well as the Queen's mark, which he transfers to Merry in a kiss. Merry returns with Doyle to the Court. The Queen claims that she wants her bloodline to continue upon the throne. She is willing to take as her heir whichever of Meredith or her cousin, Cel, can first produce an heir. She lifts the geiss of celibacy upon her Ravens for Meredith alone, insisting that she choose at least three in order to increase the chance of pregnancy. While this offer would permit Merry to end her self-imposed exile and return home, it also brings dangers. Cel, previously the sole heir, makes several attempts upon her life. Merry makes alliances with others such as Kurag, the Goblin King. However, Cel was behind the Branwyn's Tears incident in LA. In punishment, he is to be confined for six months after being coated with the oil himself, something akin to torture.

Hamilton, and was released December 12, 2006. Plot introduction The series has revolved around a conflict between title character, faerie princess Meredith NicEssus, and her cousin, Cel. Cel's mother, Queen Andais, has promised that the first of the two cousins to produce a child will become ruler of the Unseelie Court. Mistral's Kiss continues to follow Meredith's attempts to bear a child and to avoid Cel's various schemes. Plot summary Meredith wakes up from a dream where she is given a horn cup from the Consort. The horn is a lost relic belonging to Abeloec, one of her guards, and the former god of wine. Abeloec and Merry drink from the horn, and some of his former god powers are restored. The other guards receive tattoos, symbols of their former god-powers that link the guards to Meredith in a mysterious way. They are magically transported to the heart of the Unseelie sithen, the dead gardens, where sex with Meredith, Abeloec and Mistral causes the gardens to come alive again. Rain begins to fall inside the garden. Through the sex magic, Galen, Nicca and Aisling disappear into the earth, air and trees, apparently as sacrifices to bring the magic back. Merry discovers that the Sithen responds to her desires, like adjusting how much rain falls in the garden. Merry learns that Abeloec's cup was once used to make queens and goddesses, and the group speculate as to whether Merry is now immortal. Meredith asks the sithen to create a door to return to the Unseelie sithen. When they go through it, they find that they have accidentally passed into the Sluagh sithen, and they end up in the dead garden of the Sluagh. Before they can escape, they are confronted by Sholto, King of the Sluagh, and Lord of That Which Passes Between, and his two night hags, Agnes and Segna. Meredith discovers that Sholto's tentacles have been shaved off by a member of the Seelie who tricked him. The hags believe that Meredith is part of the conspiracy. Segna attacks Meredith, but before she can reach her, Sholto strikes her and throws her into the dead lake, where is she is speared by the enchanted bones of the dead. Segna is mortally wounded, but alive. Sholto and Meredith wade into the lake to euthanize Segna. In a last-ditch attempt to kill Meredith, Segna pulls her under the water. Meredith uses her Hand of Blood to finish Segna. Sholto and Meredith magically appear on the Island of Bones in the middle of the lake. Sholto carries a dagger and a spear of bone, signs of kingship among the sluagh that had been lost. The Goddess appears and gives Sholto the chance to restore magic to the Sluagh. He is given the choice to either bring the magic back with blood by killing Meredith, or by sex. If he chooses death, the black heart of the sluagh will be restored. But if he chooses sex and life, it will change the sluagh sithen to a more Seelie-like place. Sholto chooses sex and life, and together they restore magic to the Sluagh garden. In a blast of power, they are returned to the Sluagh garden which is now filled with herbs, plants and flowers. Drunk with his new power, Sholto calls the Wild Hunt to chase the sidhe. Meredith and her guards flee. Meredith conjures a protective covering of four-leaf clover and discovers a \\"thin place\\" that allow them to escape the Sluagh sithen. Now more sidhe than ever, Sholto is attacked by the very Wild Hunt that he called up, and he is forced to flee as well. Now in the real world, Meredith calls on a group of Red Caps (cousins of the goblins), led by Jonty, to fight the Wild Hunt with them. The Wild Hunt is defeated and through the remaining magic, faerie animals including dogs appear. After the battle, they are rejoined by Galen, Aisling and Nicca who, having disappeared from the garden, reappeared in the Hall of Mortality. Galen's wild magic causes flowers and water to appear in the Hall, and he accidentally causes all prisoners to be freed, including Cel, the Queen's son, who wants Meredith dead. A furious Andais confronts Meredith and tells her that she must take her guards and go back to Los Angeles tonight, because she has ruined her sithen and Andais cannot keep her safe from Cel.

Petzold was born 2 July 1794 in Lichtenhayn, a village in Saxony near Mei√üen. His father, a Protestant minister, wanted him to learn an artistic trade and in April 1798 brought him to Dresden where he apprenticed with Charles Rodolphe August Wenzky, maker of organs and pianos to the court. After five years, Petzold travelled to Vienna with a letter of recommendation from Wenzky to Walther for whom he worked until departing for Paris December 1805. Petzold formed a partnership with J. Pfeiffer in April 1806, and their first products were a cabinet upright which Petzold called the harmomelo, and a well received triangular piano, followed by an improved square. The partners established their own workshops in 1814, and the sound, regulation and construction of Petzold's subsequent instruments earned him a distinguished reputation. The enlarged soundboard Petzold introduced in square pianos at the 1806 French National Exposition received little notice. Its purpose was to increase the amount of sound, but the arrangement increased the height of the strings and required greater action leverage than the English square action could provide. Petzold substituted a variation of an English grand action with a crank escapement and individual hammer flanges, but the heavier blows it allowed required heavier stringing, which in turn required stronger frames. These changes gave his squares an unprecedented fullness and capacity for expression, and indicated the direction of subsequent changes that would take place in the art of constructing, as well as writing for and performing on pianos.  Notes  # This was a vertically strung, full size upright with underdampers operated by a crank from the keys. (Harding. p248); Fetis mistakes it for a kind of upright grand.  References  * F√©tis, F.

Description The population of 449 (2009) live on a village area of about 5.27 km¬≤ at an altitude of 560 to 580 m above sea level.Painting of Erisdorf 1589 by Philipp Renlin History In 1311, Erisdorf was mentioned first on the occasion of the sale of the lands of Lord Henry, called \\"Flekle\\", a knight, to the Salem monastery. In the sales documents its name was rendered as \\"Eringsdorf\\". The supremacy over the village went to the Lords of , then to the Lords of Reischach, In 1398, it was taken over by the Hospice of the Holy Spirit in Riedlingen that had been founded in 1378 by Konrad Manopp, the parish priest, having acquired 22 pieces of land as early as 1378, and enlarging its property even later on by the purchase of a mill. In 1403, the Abbey of Reichenau gave new tenures to it. Until the rule of W√ºrttemberg in 1805 the Riedlingen Hospice or its curator, the mayor and council of the town, had the jurisdiction, elected the head of the council, and chose the 12 lawyers from the village. Parochially, however, Erisdorf was part of Ertingen. An early mass has been held since 1403, but it was not until 1837 that it became an independent parish. Folklore Erisdorf takes also part in reanimating the Suebian traditions of \\"Fasnet\\". The Erisdorf type of carnival is marked by the colourful rites and ceremonies of the \\"R√∂thenb√§chler\\". Their costumes are blue and remind of the professional habit of millers in the 16th century. The name is taken from the stream in Erisdorf which once powered the village mill. One of the traditional festivals in Erisdorf, attracting a great number of visitors from surrounding villages, is the so-called \\"festival of the noodles\\" (\\"Nudlafescht\\"), where home-made noodles ranging from plain noodles over \\"Sp√§tzle\\" to the \\"cigar noodles\\" reminding of cigars in shape and with a sweet taste.

Hayward went on to say that while Ryan had a mischievous sense of humour, he often became annoyed when he was the victim of his sister's practical jokes. Ryan moved to Erinsborough, after being expelled from his private school. When he started at the local high school, Ryan told the other pupils that he had been expelled for locking a teacher in a cupboard. Ryan and Tiffany come to Ramsay Street to stay with their aunt, Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence).

Gemma Ramsay (Beth Buchanan) moves with her aunt Madge (Anne Charleston) and uncle Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) and both Matt and Ryan are taken with her. Ryan is disappointed when Gemma chooses Matt. Ryan's parents, Russell and Petra (Bernadette Wheatley), go overseas and he moves in with Dorothy.

At age five, Cruguet was placed in an orphanage after his father abandoned the family and his mother was unable to cope. From age ten to sixteen, he lived at a secondary school run by Roman Catholic priests where he says he was physically abused. At age sixteen, a friend of his grandfather offered the diminutive Cruguet work at a Thoroughbred race track. His fledgling career as a jockey was interrupted by mandatory military service and he served in the French Army during the Algerian War. After being discharged from the army, Cruguet returned to thoroughbred flat racing. He replaced army-bound jockey Yves Saint-Martin at the stable run by trainer Fran√ßois Mathet. Once Saint-Martin was discharged from the army, Cruguet had to find new rides but met with only limited success. After meeting his future wife Denyse, a trainer and one of the pioneering woman in French racing, in 1965, they decided to emigrate to the United States. In Florida, Cruguet was hired to ride for Horatio Luro at Hialeah Park Race Track and began to achieve success in the ensuing years. In 1969, he won a major Grade I race aboard Arts and Letters when he replaced Braulio Baeza due to another commitment, riding the future Hall of Fame colt to victory in the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park. In 2004, Jean Cruguet said Hoist The Flag was the best horse he ever rode. The 1970 U.S. Champion two-year-old colt, ridden by Cruguet in all his starts, went undefeated in his short career but in his three-year-old season was injured in March 1971 while preparing for the Wood Memorial Stakes. The career-ending injury denied the colt a chance to try for the Triple Crown. Cruguet and his wife returned to race in Europe for the 1972 season, where he won Group One races such as the Prix Vermeille and Poule d'Essai des Pouliches in France, and the Champion Stakes in England. He rode the Champion San San in all her wins for trainer Angel Penna Sr. but missed being aboard the filly for her win in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe when he was sidelined by injury as a result of a racing accident. After finishing second in France's jockey standings for 1972, Cruguet and his wife returned to the United States. In 1976, Cruguet rode the two-year-old colt Seattle Slew to victory in the Champagne Stakes. The following year, he and Seattle Slew won the Wood Memorial Stakes and the Flamingo Stakes en route to winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes, thereby capturing American racing's Triple Crown. In a move still written about today, with 20 yards to go to the finish line in the Belmont Stakes, Cruguet stood up in the stirrups, raised his right arm over his head, and jubilantly gave the crowd a victory salute by waving his whip in the air. In 1978, Cruguet was the regular jockey aboard Mac Diarmida, whose wins included the two most important North American turf races with European competitors: the Canadian International Championship at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. Mac Diarmida was voted the 1978 Eclipse Award for American Champion Male Turf Horse. Jean Cruguet retired from riding at age 41 in July 1980 to join his wife as a full-time trainer in their own small stable, but he returned to riding two years later. His last major Grade I Stakes victory came aboard Hodges Bay in the 1989 Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack. Retired and now living near Versailles, Kentucky, Cruguet made guest appearances for many years in support of organizations such as Old Friends Equine, a retirement and rescue facility for pensioned Thoroughbreds in Midway, Kentucky. For a time, he almost completely disappeared from the public eye because he was the sole caregiver for his wife Denyse, who was bedridden after suffering a debilitating stroke in 2003. She died at their home in Kentucky in September 2010. Cruguet planned a one-race comeback at the Keeneland Racecourse Spring Meet in April 2011 at age 72. Slated to ride a three-year-old filly trained by friend John Paul Pucek, he postponed his comeback attempt due to bad weather and concerns over the youth of the horse. He also planned to attempt a comeback during the 2011 Arlington Park meet as part of a special \\"Legends\\" race in support of the Permanently Disabled Jockeys Fund on August 12, but also had to withdraw from that event citing health concerns.http://www.drf.com/news/keeneland-jean-cruguet-plans- one-race-comeback Notes and references * Lexington Herald-Leader article by Maryjean Wall on Jean Cruguet Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Agen Category:French jockeys Category:American jockeys Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:French military personnel of the Algerian War ","title":"Jean Cruguet"},{"id":"5812054","text":"Fouzia Rhissassi () was born in Fes, Morocco on April 15, 1947.

Pinafore (D'Oyly Carte, 1960) Gillian Knight (born 1 November 1934) is an English singer and actress, known for her performances in the contralto roles of the Savoy operas. After six years from 1959 to 1965 starring in these roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Knight began a grand opera career. Knight joined Sadler's Wells Opera (now known as English National Opera) in 1968 and, in 1970, went on to the Royal Opera, where she performed numerous roles over a period of more than three decades. Knight has performed with many other opera companies in Britain, Europe and America and at houses internationally and has recorded many of her Gilbert and Sullivan and grand opera roles. Beginnings and D'Oyly Carte years Knight was born in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, and educated in Birmingham. She won a five-year scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where she studied with May Blythe and Roy Henderson.Sleeve notes to \\"Gilbert and Sullivan Hits for All\\", Enterprise Records, ENTB 1032 She sang in concerts, oratorio and on television with the Linden Singers while still at the Academy.Gillian Knight profile at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 5 May 2009 Knight joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1959, going on tour immediately in eight of the leading contralto roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory. In September of that year, at the age of 25, she succeeded Ann Drummond-Grant as the company's principal contralto on Drummond-Grant's death.Rollins and Witts, pp. 183‚Äì84 The Times wrote, \\"Many good Savoyards have regretted Gilbert's unkind lampooning of the unattractive elderly female, stouter than she used to be, with a caricature of a face and so on; and we have observed with gratitude that Buttercup, Ruth, Lady Jane and their equivalents are acted this season by a pleasing and personable young lady.... Miss Gillian Knight's Buttercup is in itself an iconoclastic impersonation.\\"The Times, 5 January 1962, p. 4 Before even beginning to tour with the company, her first performance with the company was to play the role of Little Buttercup in the company's recording of H.M.S.

Although originally found in snake venom, the activity of 5'nucleotidase has been described for bacteria and plant cells, and is widely distributed in vertebrate tissue. In mammalian cells the enzyme is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and its primary role is in the conversion of extracellular nucleotides (e.g. 5'-AMP), which are generally impermeable, to the corresponding nucleoside (e.g. adenosine) which can readily enter most cells. Consequently, the enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of nucleotides. The enzyme has a wide substrate specificity for nucleotides and has been shown to hydrolyze 5'nucleotides rapidly, ribose-5-phosphate slowly, and other phosphate esters extremely slowly (if at all). For example, the 5'nucleotidase enzyme catalyses the following chemical reactions : a 5'-nucleotide + H2O a nucleoside + phosphate : ribose 5-phosphate + H2O ribose + phosphate The 5'nucleotidase catalyzed reaction of an AMP nucleotide to adenosine nucleoside is shown below: AMP + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons adenosine + phosphate Nomenclature *Recommended Name: 5'nucleotidase *Systematic Name: 5'ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase *Synonyms: 5NT, 'uridine 5'-nucleotidase, 5'-adenylic phosphatase, adenosine 5'-phosphatase, AMP phosphatase, adenosine monophosphatase, 5'-mononucleotidase, AMPase, UMPase, snake venom 5'-nucleotidase, thimidine monophosphate nucleotidase, 5'-AMPase, 5'-AMP nucleotidase, AMP phosphohydrolase, IMP 5'-nucleotidase).  Structure  upright=1.25 Active site Studies of the soluble form of human ecto-5'nucleotidase, without a GPI anchor, have shown that the C-terminal domain holds the substrate-binding pocket, and that the aromatic purine motif of the substrate is stacked between two phenylalanine residues. Furthermore, a catalytic mechanism has been proposed involving an in-line nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl moiety that is coordinated by zinc on the substrate phosphorus, with the nucleoside acting as a leaving group. Membrane-bound and soluble forms Cartoon schematic of membrane-bound and soluble forms of mammalian 5'nucleotidase Studies of mammalian 5'nucleotidases have shown that there exist at least four different forms of the 5'nucleotidase enzyme: one membrane-bound form and three soluble forms. The membrane-bound form is anchored to the plasma membrane via GPI at its C-terminus. One of the soluble forms appears to be derived from the GPI- anchored ex-5'-nucleotidase and has an extracellular location. The two cytosolic forms of the enzyme have similar characteristics, but can be differentiated on the basis of their preferential affinities for nucleotide substrates. The GPI-anchored form exists as a dimer, with the two subunits linked via a disulfide bridge. The soluble forms can exist as dimers or tetramers. Generally at least 50% of the enzyme is found in the surface-bound form. Medical relevance 5' Nucleotidase blood test The concentration of 5‚Äônucleotidase protein in the blood is often used as a liver function test in individuals that show signs of liver problems. The combined assays of serum 5'nucleotisase and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities are extremely helpful in differential diagnosis since serum 5'nucleotidase activity is increased in obstructive hepatobiliary disorders, but not in osseous disorders, whereas serum AP activity is generally increased in both categories of diseases. In other words, the test is used to determine if elevated protein levels are due to skeletal damage or liver damage. Normal levels of 5‚Äônucleotidase are 2-17 units per liter. Elevated levels may indicate cholestasis, destruction of liver cells, hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver ischemia, a liver tumor, or use of liver-damaging drugs. Pregnancy and certain medications (acetaminophen, halothane, isoniazid, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin) may interfere with the test. The test may also be referred to as 5'NT Levels Blood Test, CDF73 Levels Blood Test, and Ecto-5'-Nucleotidase Levels Blood Test. Lymphocyte 5'nucleotidase in immunological disorders Ecto-5'Nucleotidase is considered a maturation marker for T cells and B cells. This is due to the fact that the enzyme activity is approximately 10-times higher for peripheral T cells than thymocytes, 5-6 times higher in adult peripheral B cells than fetal B cells, and largely absent in non-T cell and non-B cell lymphocytes. In immunodeficiency diseases with arrested lymphocyte maturation, ex-5'nucleatidase activity is generally low. Such diseases include severe combined immuno-deficiency, Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome, congenital X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective IgA deficiency and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Relation to lead poisoning Numerous studies have shown that erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase activity is significantly lowered in patients with lead poisoning, and that pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase activity can be used as an index of lead poisoning. It is believed that lead induced deficiency of the enzyme in maturing erythroid cells is responsible for basophilic stippling and hemolysis in a manner analogous to the pathogenesis of the hereditary enzyme deficiency syndrome. The mechanism of inhibition of 5'nucleotidase in lead poisoning may contribute to the hemolytic syndromes that occur in patients with acute lead poisoning. Since erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'NT activity is inhibited in vitro by various metals (e.g., copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, and tin), it is likely that inhibition of pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase may contribute to the hemolytic syndromes that occur in patients with acute poisoning by these metals.

It is located at the border of Assam and Meghalaya states some 112 km from Haflong, the district headquarters of Dima Hasao district of Assam. Khandong Dam Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya The Umrongso Reservoir Etymology History The region has been deeply affected by factional violence involving several armed insurgent groups fighting among themselves and with the Indian Security Forces. Since 2011 there has been a decrease in violence following arrests of several high- ranking insurgent leaders and a cease-fire agreement with the Indian Government. Economy Energy NEEPCO - Kopili Hydro Electric Project A government of India enterprise, located in the Dima Hasao district (formerly known as North Cachar Hills district) near the Assam- Meghalaya border, the hot spring of Garampani is now lost in the dammed water of Kopili river after completion of Kopili Hydro Electric Project. The Kopili Hydro Electric Project was the maiden venture of NEEPCO when it came into existence in 1976. ; Khandong and Kopili Power Station : The first stage of Kopili Hydro Electric Plant has two dam and dyke systems which created two reservoirs, one on the Kopili River and the other on the Umrong stream, a tributary of the Kopili. Water from the Kopili reservoir is used in the Khandong power station through a 2759 metre tunnel to generate 50 MW (2 √ó 25 MW) of power. The tail water from this powerhouse is led to the Umrong reservoir. The water from Umrong reservoir is taken through a 5473 metre tunnel to the Kopili power station to generate 200 MW (4 √ó 50 MW) of power. : The first stage extension of the plant envisaged setting up two additional 50 MW units at Kopili power station, provisions for which were already kept during the first stage development of the project. The Units III and IV under this extension scheme were commissioned in March 1997 and June 1997 respectively. The total installed capacity of the Kopili power station thus went up to 200 MW and that of the project as whole to 275 MW. The Umrong reservoir was raised by 7.6 m to meet the demand for more water for two additional 50 MW units of first stage extension. ; KHEP Stage II power station:''' : The second stage of the Kopili Hydro Electric Plant involves a powerhouse to generate additional 25 MW of power by using water from the Khandong reservoir through a 481 metre long water conductor system, provision of which was kept as a bypass conduit from the surge shaft in the Khandong tunnel. The water from the second stage powerhouse will go to the Umrong reservoir for use in the Kopili power station. Cement Industry * Vinay Cement : Vinay Cements was set up in 1989 at a capital cost of ‚Çπ270 million. At the time of commissioning, it was one of the largest private sector investments in the North-East region. The plant uses rotary technology with a four stage pre-heater and fourth generation grate cooler with current installed capacity of 0.24 million tons per annum. In its category, it has consistently been among the top three manufacturers of cement since its inception. In 2004 it became a 100% debt-free company. In 2006‚Äì2007 it has reported revenues of ‚Çπ488 million and an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA) of ‚Çπ117 million. With a view to consolidate the group companies and provide greater shareholder value, it has recently initiated the process of acquiring RCL Cement in an all-stock deal. * NECEM Cements Limited (1989) * RCL (1999), * Calcom (2007) * Dalmia cement factory (2011).

Plot The game plot takes place in the time shortly before Ragnar√∂k, an epic battle at the end of the world in Norse mythology. The player assumes the role of a fallen warrior (an Einherjar) tasked by the god Odin to attempt to change the destiny of the gods and avert their fall during the coming war. Although the title takes some liberty with the accepted mythos, most elements are well represented and hence can be considered semi-educational. The tasks given to the player include: * Recovering the missing head of Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. * Finding key items needed to forge a chain to bind Fenrir. * Strengthening Thor's fishing line, so that it doesn't break when catching the world serpent. * Obtaining a special breastplate for Heimdall. Once all of the tasks are completed, Heimdall can be asked to blow his horn, causing the battle of Ragnar√∂k to commence, with the outcome then being reported to the player. Gameplay The gameplay elements are relatively primitive, although the game does feature a large world with many areas to explore. Combat often involves the player attacking and then fleeing in order to minimize damage sustained. Many different weapons and armor are acquired as the player travels through the various regions, growing progressively stronger with each enemy defeated. This was one of the first open world games that did not send the character on a linear path, as the player is free to explore the many maps in any order. Reception Computer Gaming World praised the detail of Interstel's research into Norse mythology, but stated that \\"most players will probably find Dusk to be a very disappointing experience\\", with VGA graphics that \\"lack imagination\\", poor gameplay documentation, and \\"monotonous\\" text.

It is in the Malwa region of western Madhya Pradesh. Kamitpuran Parshwanath Mulnayak: Nearly 63 cms. high black-coloured idol of Bhagwan Kamitpuran Parshvanath in the padmasana posture. There is an umbrella of 7 hoods over the head of the idol. There is a speciality in the hoods of this idol which is not there in any other idol of Bhagwan Parshvanath. On the hood on both the sides, Dharnendradev and Padmavatidevi are carved Tirth: It is in the Jain temple street in the Unhel village. Historicity: This temple belongs to a period earlier that the 10th century. Ruins of the Gupta period are found here which indicate the antiquity of this place. The ancient name of this village was Toran. When Janmejay of Nagda, performed the Naag Yagna, he erected 4 gates with arches in all 4 directions of which one was in this place. A city was established here and it came to be known as Toran. When this was destroyed, a new city was built in its place and it came to be known as Unhel. This temple was renovated many times. The last renovation was accomplished in V.S.2020 and the idol was installed by Acharyadev Vijay Vigyansurishvarji. This idol is believed to be more than 2,000 years old. Non-jains also worship this idol with great devotion. If worshipped with great faith, the wishes of the devotees are fulfilled, hence the name ‚ÄúKamitpuran‚Äù. This Parshvanath is more famous by the name of ‚ÄúChintamani Parshvanath‚Äù. Miracles keep happening here. During festival days of special significance, sounds of various musical instruments being played along with the singing of devotional song are heard in the night. One feels as if the ‚ÄúArati‚Äù of the Lord is being performed by some invisible divine beings from heaven. Some years ago, Ami (nectar) appeared flowing from the eyes of the idol. Some devotees cleaned the eyes by wiping off this Ami and yet the flow had continued for sometime and stopped automatically. Other Temples: There are two more temples near, nakoda bherav, shri gurudev and mata saraswati mandir. Works of art and Sculpture: The idol of God is extraordinary and fascinating. There is no other idol of this kind. The temple is also very artistic and it is very peaceful here. Guidelines: Unhel, the nearest railway station on the Ujjain-Ratlam railway line is at a distance of 10 kms. and Ujjain is at a distance of 40 kms. from this temple. Bus service and private vehicles are available. There is a Dharamshala near the temple. Food is provided on prior intimation.

It is located near the road between Tallinn and St. Petersburg. History Following the end of the Soviet Union's 45-year rule over Estonia, P√ºssi saw a sharp economic downturn and a population exodus. In 1989 the population of P√ºssi stood at 2,400 people, and 20 years later, in 2009, was only 1,809. The population has continued to decrease and by 2012 stood at 1,783 people. In October 2013, P√ºssi along with Maidla Parish were merged into L√ºganuse Parish, and therefore ceased to exist as sovereign municipalities. Economy By 2002 P√ºssi had accumulated 20 million kroons of debt, the equivalent to 1.3 million euros; and property values had become so low that apartments were valued around zero. Since then, the city's economy has begun to recover. P√ºssi has planned the construction of an industrial park. The Chairman of the town council, in an interview with The Baltic Times, marketed P√ºssi by stating that property values in the city were only 1% of those of the capital city of Tallinn. P√ºssi has historically served as a production center for particle board. At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the town's largest employer was particle board manufacturer Repo Vabrikud, which employed 1,400 people, over half the city. Although Repo Vabrikud has scaled back employment significantly, other particle board manufacturers have moved in. Sorbes Group has the production center for its \\"Repo by Sorbes\\" line of particle board in P√ºssi. In 2011, the Estonian furniture manufacturer Viisnurk took over an inactive softboard factory in the city with the intention to manufacture softboard for international clients in Asia and Europe. In December 2010, Siemens announced that P√ºssi had been selected as the location of one of two converter stations for their \\"EstLink 2\\" high voltage power line between Estonia and Finland. Culture P√ºssi is the home of the P√ºssi Punk Festival, which has run annually since 2005, and features rock, metal, blues, and indie musicians from several countries. The town contains an artificial mountain made of ash from an oil shale power plant that has been depositing ash in the location since the 1930s. The mountain is used for motocross racing. Notable person Painter Carl Timoleon von Neff (1804‚Äì1877) was born in P√ºssi.

The open-loop transfer function is equal to the product of all transfer function blocks in the forward path in the block diagram. The closed-loop transfer function is obtained by dividing the open-loop transfer function by the sum of one (1) and the product of all transfer function blocks throughout the feedback loop. The closed-loop transfer function may also be obtained by algebraic or block diagram manipulation. Once the closed-loop transfer function is obtained for the system, the closed-loop poles are obtained by solving the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is nothing more than setting the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function to zero (0). In control theory there are two main methods of analyzing feedback systems: the transfer function (or frequency domain) method and the state space method. When the transfer function method is used, attention is focused on the locations in the s-plane where the transfer function (the poles) or zero (the zeroes). Two different transfer functions are of interest to the designer. If the feedback loops in the system are opened (that is prevented from operating) one speaks of the open-loop transfer function, while if the feedback loops are operating normally one speaks of the closed-loop transfer function. For more on the relationship between the two see root-locus. Closed-loop poles in control theory The response of a linear time-invariant system to any input can be derived from its impulse response and step response. The eigenvalues of the system determine completely the natural response (unforced response). In control theory, the response to any input is a combination of a transient response and steady-state response. Therefore, a crucial design parameter is the location of the eigenvalues, or closed-loop poles. In root-locus design, the gain K is usually parameterized. Each point on the locus satisfies the angle condition and magnitude condition and corresponds to a different value of K. For negative feedback systems, the closed-loop poles move along the root-locus from the open-loop poles to the open-loop zeroes as the gain is increased. For this reason, the root-locus is often used for design of proportional control, i.e. those for which \\\\textbf{G}_c = K. Finding closed- loop poles Consider a simple feedback system with controller \\\\textbf{G}_c = K, plant \\\\textbf{G}(s) and transfer function \\\\textbf{H}(s) in the feedback path. Note that a unity feedback system has \\\\textbf{H}(s)=1 and the block is omitted. For this system, the open-loop transfer function is the product of the blocks in the forward path, \\\\textbf{G}_c\\\\textbf{G} = K\\\\textbf{G}. The product of the blocks around the entire closed loop is \\\\textbf{G}_c\\\\textbf{G}\\\\textbf{H} = K\\\\textbf{G}\\\\textbf{H}. Therefore, the closed-loop transfer function is : \\\\textbf{T}(s)=\\\\frac{K\\\\textbf{G}}{1+K\\\\textbf{G}\\\\textbf{H}}. The closed-loop poles, or eigenvalues, are obtained by solving the characteristic equation {1+K\\\\textbf{G}\\\\textbf{H}}=0. In general, the solution will be n complex numbers where n is the order of the characteristic polynomial. The preceding is valid for single-input-single-output systems (SISO). An extension is possible for multiple input multiple output systems, that is for systems where \\\\textbf{G}(s) and \\\\textbf{K}(s) are matrices whose elements are made of transfer functions.

The reservation is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and is an important nesting area for the piping plover and the least tern. Access to the reservation is through the adjoining Parker River National Wildlife Refuge. Geography Entrance sign in the parking lot beneath Bar Head. Sandy Point State Reservation is on a large spit of sand at the southern end of Plum Island: \\"Sandy Point\\". Plum Island Drive, a dirt road on the southern half of Plum Island, ends at the foot of a hill of glacial origin, Bar Head. Rocks: \\"Bar Head Rocks\\", extend from a 19th-century gravel pit in the side of the hill into the water. Some of them have been formed into a rudimentary breakwater at the high water line. At present harbor seals have been observed basking in these rocks and in Emerson Rocks slightly further north in the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge. They are rare; visitors cannot count on seeing one. They are advised by sign not to approach a seal if one is present. The presence of the seals has also brought their main predators back to the waters off Plum Island: sharks. Although shark attacks are extremely rare as yet, sightings are not. Among them is the great white shark. Swimmers either from the beach or from boats off the beach are advised to consider the dangers. On the north side of Bar Head is Stage Island Pool, a fresh-water pond created on the vestiges of a 19th-century salt works. It is named after Stage Island, the esker that forms its northern border. The drying vats stood where the pool now stands; gravel was mined from the hill to place a circular protective access road around what is now the pool area. Within it was a canal and within that the vats. A dike was placed across the mouth of what was then Bar Island Creek (now non-existent) dividing it from Stage Island Creek and creating an impoundment in the canals, kept full by several pump-up windmills and a treadmill. Water was periodically channeled from the canal to the drying vats. The salt works was not profitable and did not last long. The dike was kept, behind which fresh-water runoff drowned the vats and the canal, creating a convenient refuge for birds. The Parker River National Wildlife Refuge extends to the foot of Bar Hill on the southern side of Stage Island Pool; that is, the pool is not in the state park. Stage Island is part of the refuge. The trail on state land along the southern half of the pool, which follows the old salt-works road, is continued in the refuge on the northern side. The road on the east side of the pond also is not state land. The dunes in this area have been stabilized with stands of black pine. Visitors are restricted from the dunes and in summer the beach on the federal reservation. A large variety of rarely seen birds may feed and rest in and around the pool. An observation tower on federal land, open in the summer, is of use in viewing the birds. Sailboat beating upwind into the channel in Ipswich Bay. Castle Hill and Crane's Beach are visible in the background. The tide is high. A breaker on Sandy Point is visible in the foreground. The state park contains mainly the hill and the sand spit, a maritime feature. The Atlantic Local Coastal Pilot of 1879 gives detailed instructions for sailing into the Ipswich River and Plum Island Sound from the Atlantic. It advises the captain of a sailing vessel to heave to and send for a pilot, as \\"The bar at the entrance to Ipswich Harbor is of shifting sand and changes its position with every heavy gale ....\\" The channel went, and still goes, between two bars, North Breaker, extending from Sandy Point, and South Breaker, extending from the vicinity of Castle Hill. In 1879 they were marked by buoys and lights. Currently North Breaker is marked by a spar buoy and South Breaker by a can buoy, in addition to the channel buoys. At low tide North Breaker is nearly entirely exposed. The reference points out the difficulty in 1879 of anchoring either off the mouth of the channel or in Plum Island Sound, as the currents may cause the vessel to drag anchor. Currently Ipswich Harbor is sprinkled with mooring buoys securely fastened to the bottom. At low tide water in the channel may be as deep as only , which is true today. As at the northern end of Plum Island, tidal currents through the channel are unusually swift; moreover, the sands near the low tide mark are uncompacted and form quicksands. In the age of wooden sailing vessels, it was possible for small cargo vessels to sail up the Ipswich to unload their cargos closer to town. Today mainly motorized recreational vessels are seen in marinas along the river. The reference estimated the height of Castle Hill ‚Äî called that even then ‚Äî at . Bar Head was estimated to be 40‚Äì50 feet high and was bare of trees. Today the entire hill is covered with a dense and impassable thicket, a refuge for birds. A trail has been cut from the beach to a vegetation-choked wooden observation tower on the summit. Historical summary Bar Island seen from Sandy Point at low tide. In the earliest documents concerning the Plum Island region (17th century) the major features are named with their current names. The coastal terrain of the North Shore of Massachusetts is mainly of glacial origin. Moraines and eskers in the wetlands are often called \\"islands\\" regardless of whether they are so. Bar Head received its original name of Bar Island from the bar extending from Sandy Point. Bar Head is currently preferred, but that name may also refer to only Bar Head Rocks or only to the cliff facing the sea. In the time of the salt works, a small village was placed there, Bar Island Village. In colonial times as now Bar Island was never an island, even at high tides.This Bar Island with its breakers is the one mentioned by late-19th- and 20th-century writings as being visible from Castle Hill, site of the former Crane Mansion. Although the tops of a few elevations of southern Maine are visible from Castle Hill on a clear day, the low-lying Bar Island, Maine, and any breakers on it, are far beyond the horizon. Just to the north of Bar Island is Stage Island, also formerly called \\"the Bluffs\\", which is an esker. Early literature refers to it as an upland. These terms are relative to the point of view of a boat on the water, as Stage Island was never an island and the bluffs are only a gentle rise of 10‚Äì20 feet off the water, not a bluff or an upland in the usual montane sense of the word. The term stage comes from some sort of stage, unknown now, used for drying fish at that location. Also visible from Sandy Point are Grape Island and Middle Ground, or Middle Island, which are islands in Plum Island Sound, Castle Hill, Little Neck and Jeffrey's or Great Neck. The latter three are divided from the mainland by the wetlands of the Ipswich River and the Essex River. The south end of Plum Island can only be accessed (except along Plum Island Drive) by boat from hills and necks that are far from town and difficult to access themselves. From commons to estate From 1634 to 1649 use of the southern portion of Plum Island was ungoverned. Individuals pastured farm animals there in the summer, mainly hogs. In 1649 the General Court of Massachusetts apportioned the southern 2/5 of Plum Island to Ipswich, Massachusetts. It was at first managed by appointees of the town as a commons. If the town harvested the grass it was distributed to those who had no grass; otherwise, individuals were allowed to harvest grass at will. Mutual interferences were punishable by fine. By popular demand at town meetings the Ipswich portion of Plum Island, Hog Island and Castle Neck (on which was Castle Hill) were divided into lots, 1664‚Äì1665, which were distributed to the legal residents. On April 10, 1665, selectmen chosen by town meeting for the purpose found that there were 203 \\"reckoned and allowed inhabitants\\" and of commons. Allowing 2 shares (6 acres) for 28 persons, 1.5 shares (4.5 acres) for 70 persons and 1 share (3 acres) for the rest, they specified a method for laying out 266 shares starting from the Rowley border. The shares received by a person: 2, 1.5 or 1, depended on the person's assessed wealth. The lots were distributed by a system that combined chance and wealth such that \\"the fine upland lots fell in the main to the humbler folk.\\" In 1667 the town acted to restrict herd animals from the newly distributed commons, as \\"the value of the upland lots, particularly, was greatly impaired by the unrestrained wandering of the cattle and swine....\\" These and other measures were not effective. Animals originating in Newbury continued to devastate the island. In 1679 Ipswich petitioned the General Court again charging that the marshes were being \\"trodden to dirt\\" and the cover removed from the dunes was destabilizing the sand. The court acted to forbid animals from the island without proprietor permission, but as this measure was not effective either, in 1739 all animals were restricted from the island under penalty of impoundment and heavy fines if the animals were claimed, confiscation if they were not. The cutting of trees and bushes also was forbidden, with a fine for each plant cut. The act was continued until at least 1785. The commons division of 1665 was no great windfall to the population of Ipswich. Many were not farmers and had no animals. The remote location prevented most from occupying and building on their land. Other crops could not be grown in the sandy and salty soil; only salt marsh hay was worth anything. The parcels were advertised as \\"fine upland farms\\", but they were neither farms nor upland. If a farmer did pasture his animals there in the summer, they had to compete for the grass with unrestrained herds from the north. The best course for the new owner was to sell if he could find a buyer. They were not long in arriving; entrepreneurs gradually bought up the land for their own purposes. Middle Island was the richest farmland and was close to the Ipswich shore. The original recipients were John Brown and William Buckley. In 1693 John Pengry bought the island and in subsequent years the lots in the marsh and dunes opposite. He acquired Stage Island. He did not occupy the land himself, but chose to build a house and barn and lease the expanded farm to Amos Goodwin. In 1712-13 Pengry sold to Nathaniel Emerson, a fisherman who had been born in Ipswich but lived in Gloucester, thus starting the Emerson dynasty. The Emersons placed a fishing business there: a wharf, a warehouse, fish-drying stages, and kept two sloops in the creeks: the Sea Flower and the Hope. Emerson Rocks are named after the Emersons. In 1732 Pengry sold another tract including Stage Island, which was resold and ended up in the hands of William Dodge, a \\"wealthy merchant.\\" He kept a schooner, the Rebecca, and a fleet of smaller boats in Plum Island sound and owned a \\"negro man servant, Scipio.\\" Although slaves could not be legally purchased in Massachusetts, they could be bought elsewhere and owned in Massachusetts, and were, extensively. In 1783 Dodge bought Bar Island, which had been tenanted by small landholders attempting to live there. The island was clear of vegetation and remained so until the 20th century. The Emersons reached a peak in the 1730s when the estate came into the hands of the brothers, Nathaniel and Broster. An alcoholic, Broster squandered the assets of the business, forcing it into bankruptcy. Nathaniel's son Stephen in 1740 sold to Ralph Cross, a shipbuilder from Newbury, the first of the Cross dynasty. He gradually bought all the Ipswich portion of Plum Island up to and over the Rowley line, except for Stage Island and Bar Island, which was sold as a single estate to various owners. The Cross holdings became known as Cross Farm, a name which they hold today. Stage Island and some of the marsh to the north were the last remnant of privately held land in the south of the island, but now they have been left to the Federal reservation. Although the hay was cut and sold for a profit, the holdings were never a subsistence farm as on the mainland. The now apparently rural sound was then a busy harbor where 3-masters anchored between shores lined with shipyards and the warehouses of merchants from the Parker River southward. By the 19th century the businesses were preempted by Newburyport Harbor, not accessible from the sound, and the region declined. Commercial enterprises The public interest Hazards of Ipswich Bar Bar Head Rocks, a prelude to disaster. Seen here at low tide, they are covered at high, waiting to take the bottom out of a vessel trying to clear Sandy Point. Ipswich Bar, as Sandy Point has been called historically, has a long history of tragedy. The swift currents and shallow waters are dangerous at any time of year, but they are fatal most often in winter and in a storm. Sailing vessels were driven aground on the bar and although in full sight of land only 1/4 mile or less away the victims could not reach it except through the chilled waters and breaking surf, and if they did reach it, found themselves far from assistance. The main cause of death is hypothermia or drowning following on hypothermia, which ensues in only a few minutes in the winter waters of Massachusetts, chilled by the Labrador current. Records of the loss of small boats began in the 18th century. They went aground on the beach or bar in winter. The boat's complement attempting to reach shore died in the surf or on the beach. As those buried in the sand did not stay buried a cemetery was established for them on Bar Island. Among the disasters of greater magnitude is the wreck of the Falconer, a 360-ton brig from Belfast captained by Joseph Rolerson, of the same city, whom the town records of Ipswich, Massachusetts, list as Captain Joseph Rawlinson. She was transporting 350 tons of coal from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to Boston when she encountered the northeaster of December 15, 1847. The ship carried 53 passengers and crew, including the captain's wife and son. The initial phase of the storm was mild and foggy. A lumber ship, the Pliant, of Eastport, Maine, under Captain Reynolds, lost its way in the fog and struck on Ipswich Bar, the entire crew escaping without further incident. Captain Rolerson out at sea observing Squam Light at Gloucester, Massachusetts, believed it was Cohasset Light south of Cape Ann and tacked north to enter what he thought was Boston Harbor. In reality it was Ipswich Bay. Observing the bar lights at Ipswich and Newburyport he knew he was lost and dropped anchor three miles (5 km) from shore to wait out the storm, a fatal judgement. On the night of the 17th the temperature dropped, the full force of the storm struck the ship, she dragged anchor and struck Ipswich Bar 3/4 of a mile from Patch's Beach, as it was then called, at the foot of Castle Hill. There was a driving snow. At daybreak the residents immediately sent for help to Ipswich away. The vessel foundered in breakers throwing spray mast-high and began to disintegrate. The ship's boat was thrown in the surf, drowning three. The captain's wife and son with many passengers died of exposure in the cold wind, unable to shelter below deck. Help arrived at the beach, the remaining ship's complement were taken off at great hazard in small, open boats. The captain died within an hour of reaching safety. The residents of Ipswich opened their homes. The wreck resulted in 17 deaths. After a funeral procession winding through town they were buried in Ipswich, except for the captain and his family, who were shipped back to Belfast. Many of dead were poor immigrants headed for a new life in America. On December 3, 1849, the Nancy with a cargo of bricks went aground on Plum Island. The crew of five were lost. On December 24, 1850, the Argus with a cargo of worked stone foundered on Emerson Rocks. The captain and some of the crew were lost. Two were trailed through the snow to a thicket, where they were found dead. The list continues: the Ornament, the Teazer, the Votary and in 1883 the City Point, a sidewheeler, on Emerson rocks. In 1802 and in 1852 the Merrimack Humane Society of Newburyport constructed shelters for cast-away mariners at Sandy Point. Only scattered stones remain. The dunes at the south end of Plum Island are strewn with massive ship timbers, some protruding from the sand at odd angles, causing visitors to speculate concerning their origin. Ecology View inland from Stage Island. In the foreground is Stage Island Creek at low tide, an intertidal flat. Part of the island is shown, then Plum Island Sound, and in the background Jeffrey's Neck, Ipswich. To the right of that is the entrance to the Eagle Hill River. The inland side of Plum Island is an estuary containing four subcategories of ecosystem: salt marsh, fresh marsh, tidal creeks and bays and intertidal flats. Over the last 50 years the system has been declining due to a decreased rate of sedimentation caused by the abandonment of farming in the region, reforestation of the former farms, and a gradual rise in sea level. Fresh marsh is visible in Stage Island Pool. The predominant plants around its fringes are Typha latifolia (common cattail), and the intrusive species, Phragmites (common reed) and Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife). Northward from Stage Island can be seen salt marsh stretching to the horizon interspersed with tidal creeks. At low tide shellfishing takes place in the intertidal flats, typically of individuals digging for clams, which are cooked and sold in all the restaurants of the region. Salt marsh features Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) and Spartina patens (marsh hay). Along the south of Plum Island some haying continues, whether government-sponsored or associated with private ownership or leases. Activities and amenities The park offers beachcombing, fishing, restricted hunting, and walking trails. Birdwatching opportunities include a wealth of seabirds, shore birds, and field birds.

He also made good links with Anantpur and other neighbouring towns. At present, the government owns Uravakonda but the descendants of Govindachar are still alive.

The built-in 2 MB of RAM can be upgraded up to 32 with (2x16) SIMM that Akai provided. Iomega Zip drives were very commonly used for storage and backup.

A member of the Madrid Bar Association since 1976, Calder√≥n opened his Law Firm: Calderon Abogados, where he has been working during the last 40 years. Life and career Calder√≥n was the 16th President of Real Madrid from 2 July 2006 until 16 January 2009 and also club Director from 2001 to 2006. He has also been the Director of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), President of the Centenary Committee and, on the international level, was appointed Vice-President of UEFA's Club Competition Committee, and Director of the FIFA World Club Cup Committee, being an active and prominent participant and collaborator with UEFA and FIFA. As Real Madrid's president, the club won two La Liga championships and one Spanish Super Cup. He hired Fabio Capello as manager in his first year and Bernd Schuster, in the second one. Amongst his promises when running for election was the signing of Arjen Robben from Chelsea, Cesc F√†bregas from Arsenal and Kak√° from Milan. He was only successful with Robben. On 19 July 2006, Calder√≥n announced his first two signings, Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson; both signed from newly demoted Juventus for an estimated ‚Ç¨20 million. He later signed Ruud van Nistelrooy from Manchester United and Mahamadou Diarra from Lyon, as well as delivering on his promise to acquire Robben from Chelsea. A year long loan swap deal was also concluded with Jos√© Antonio Reyes from Arsenal moving to Real Madrid in exchange for J√∫lio Baptista. Before the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Calder√≥n tried to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to the club, but failed in doing so as the player wanted to stay one more year at Manchester United. Finally, on 12 December 2008, he managed to sign the contract with the Portuguese player for the next 6 years, after having agreed a transfer fee of ‚Ç¨94 million with United. Calder√≥n was major proponent and driving force behind the club's social and institutional transformation. While at the helm, he strengthened Real Madrid's social responsibility programs as well as the activities of its Foundation (where he is currently a Member of the Board) opening several Academies around the world to help children improve their lives.

Currently, he workes in his law office in Madrid where he has been practising during 40 years, and participates regularly on TV and Radio Football Programs in Spain and abroad (beIN Sports, BBC, Sky Sports, Talksport, ESPN, SiriuxRadio, Newsweek and others) On 16 January 2009 and after many pressures, Calder√≥n decided to resign as Real Madrid president following unfair allegations of vote-rigging for the confirmation for the financial Budget. The supposed rigging consisted in the presence, in a General Assembly, of 10 non-accredited people among 1,380 participants while the Budget was approved for 350 votes. The case was taking to Court and the ruling of the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid was in favor of Calder√≥n stating that he had not had any responsibility in that matter and that, on top of that, the presence of the people not credited, did not affect the result for the approval of the Loss and Profit Account.

It is also classified as Morella pensylvanica. Myrica pensylvanica is a deciduous shrub growing to 4.5 m tall. The leaves are 2.5‚Äì7 cm long and 1.5-2.7 cm broad, broadest near the leaf apex, serrate, and sticky with a spicy scent when crushed. The flowers are borne in catkins 3‚Äì18 mm long, in range of colors from green to red. The fruit is a wrinkled berry 3‚Äì5.5 mm diameter, with a pale blue-purple waxy coating; they are an important food for yellow-rumped warblers. This species has root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, allowing it to grow in relatively poor soils.  Taxonomy  This plant is one of several Myrica species that are sometimes split into the genus Morella, e.g. in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. Additionally southern bayberry, M. caroliniensis, and this species are sometimes lumped, disregarding the putative difference that M. caroliniensis is evergreen or tardily deciduous. M. pensylvanica is similar to wax myrtle, M. cerifera. These plants' leaves and scent distinguish them: wax myrtle leaves have scent glands on both sides and are fragrant when crushed, northern bayberry has scent glands mainly on the leaf undersides and is not markedly fragrant. Northern bayberry hybridizes with both southern bayberry and wax myrtle. Uses The berries can be used to make bayberry wax candles. American colonists boiled the berries to extract the sweet-smelling wax, which they used to make clean-burning candles.Mark H. Brand. \\"Myrica pensylvanica: Northern Bayberry\\".

It is a simplified relative of Euchre, and has many variations throughout Northern Europe. The game has been popular in England for many years, and has given the language a slang expression, \\"to go nap\\",From the game of Nap, when a player sets himself to get all five tricks - Thesaurus of Traditional English Metaphors, pg. 602 meaning to take five of anything.The book of card games, Peter Arnold, 1995 - pg. 162 It may be less popular now than it was, but it is still played in some parts of southern England and in Strathclyde. Despite its title and allusions, it is not recorded before the last third of the nineteenth century, and may have been first named after Napoleon III.Oxford Book of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 163 Rules The old game of Napoleon consists simply of five cards dealt out singly with the various players bidding in their turn how many tricks they think they can make. The player to the dealer's left has the privilege of bidding first, and then every player after him may bid up to the limit, Napoleon, which is a declaration to take all five tricks. Whoever bids highest leads first, the card led determining the trump for that round, and the winner of the trick then leads to the next. The cards are not gathered or packed together, but left face upwards on the table in front of their owners, except for the winning card, which must be kept turned face down on the table. This is the simplest form of Napoleon, requiring only that the players judge the value of their hands regarding the number of players and any bid that may have been previously made. Set-up Nap is best for four to five players using a stripped pack from 28 to 52 cards. If four play, 28 to 32 cards are used, if five, 36 to 40 cards. When six play the dealer deals himself no hand, but pays or receives the same as the other players. The cards in each suit rank from high to low (ace high). The dealer deals five cards to each player. Deal and play are clockwise, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Draw The players cut to determine the dealer for the first deal. The player with the lowest card deals first. The ace ranks below the two.Morehead, Albert H., Official Rules of Card Games , Fawcett Crest Books, New York, 1983. Ballantine Books by arrangement with the United States Playing Card Company. . Pages 186‚Äì188. Shuffle and cut After the shuffle, the pack is cut by the player at the dealer's right. The cut must leave at least four cards in each packet. Deal Each player receives five cards, dealt in a round of three at a time, followed by a round of two at a time. Bidding for four- or five- player Nap The bidding starts with the player to dealer's left, and goes clockwise round to end with the dealer. Each player is allowed only one bid and it must be higher than the preceding bid (or a pass). :The allowed bids are as follows: * Three - the bidder undertakes to win at least three tricks - most schools tend to not bother especially if money is involved * Four - the bidder undertakes to win at least four tricks * Nap - the bidder undertakes to win all five tricks * Napoleon or Bonaparte - the bidder undertakes to win all five tricks by leading the lowest trump first * Wellington - the bidder undertakes to take all five tricks by leading the lowest non-trump first Play The high bidder makes the opening lead, and the suit of this lead becomes trump. The hands are played out in tricks with clockwise rotation. A player must follow the suit led if able. If unable to follow led suit, any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump card in it; if no trump is in the trick the highest card of the suit led wins. The winner of the trick leads for the next trick. Scoring Napoleon is usually played for stakes. An equal number of chips is distributed to every player. It is also possible to play for money (as in \\"Penny Nap\\", where each trick is worth one penny)Phillips, Hubert, The Pan Book of Card Games, Pan Books, London, 1960. . Pages 268‚Äì269. If the bidder makes his bid, he collects from each other player, although it matters nothing if he makes more tricks than he declared. He is paid only for the number of tricks that he first declared. If he is defeated, he pays every other player, but only for the tricks he declared before the play *Less than 5: Bidder wins 1 for each trick from every player, or pays 1 for each trick to every player if he loses. *Nap: Bidder wins 10 from every player, or loses 5 to every player. Thus, playing Nap against 4 players, the bidder would win 40 chips (10 from every player), or lose 20 chips (the bidder pays 5 to every player). Penalties Failure to follow suit to the lead when able is called a \\"revoke\\". A revoking bidder must pay all opponents as though he had lost. A revoking player must pay the bidder the full amount he would have collected had he won. In the last case, the other opponents pay nothing. In every case, play is abandoned and settlement is made at once. Variations :Variations allow the following additional bids: *Two - A bid to win two tricks. *A joker may be added, counting as the highest trump, or in \\"Mis\\", as the only trump. * Players bet 1 chip each deal in a cumulative pot. The first to bid and win 5 tricks takes the pot. *After each player receives five cards, the next card is taken to be a floater. Players other than the dealer must bet 1 chip to look at the floater. Players can make bids with or without the floater (without is a higher bid than with). Mis Mis, Mis√®re, or Mysery is a bid to lose every trick. It ranks between three and four in the bidding. At Mis√®re, an adaptation from Solo Whist, there is no trump suit. The principle is that the bidder has to lose the whole five tricks, while his opponents make it their business to force the player to take a trick. At some tables, trumps are recognized, determined in the usual way by the initial lead. However, this feature has doubtless been imported by players unacquainted with the original Mis√®re and the method of playing it. Wellington Wellington is when the bidder undertakes to win all five tricks. The bidder must lead with his lowest value trump card when bidding Wellington. The stakes, if he loses, are double what they are in Napoleon. Wellington can only be bid if another player has already bid Nap. It was introduced into the game by \\"card-sharpers\\", who, working in collusion, used it to systematically overcall \\"Mr. Jugging's\\" Naps, and the unconscious \\"Mr. Jugging\\", attracted by the pleasing novelty, introduced this modality among his friends.The Cyclopaedia of Card and Table Games, Professor Hoffmann - William Clowes & Sons, London 1891, pg. 127 Bl√ºcher Bl√ºcher is a bid to win all five tricks. It can only be bid after another player has bid Wellington. Sir Garnet Sir Garnet consists of a hand in excess of five cards, dealt in the usual way and left on the table. Until this extra hand is appropriated, each player, when it is his turn to bid, has the privilege of taking it up and combining it with his own hand. From the ten cards in his possession, he then discards five, throwing them away face downwards, and on the remaining five he is bound to declare Napoleon. Peep Nap It consists of one extra card dealt face downwards on the table, and each player, on his turn to bid, may at his option have a private peep at the card by paying one Penny, or chip, to the pool. When all the players have bid, the superior declaring hand has the privilege, if he has \\"peeped\\", of exchanging the table card for one of his own. In the event of a Nap call, it is a rule to the advantage of the following players to peep also, as, if the bidder uses the peep card, they have thereby a guide as to what suit to save. Ecart√© Nap Arguably the most interesting form of Napoleon. After the deal, and before any bid, the dealer goes round and serves out fresh cards from the pack in exchange of as many cards as the players wish to throw away from their original hands. For every fresh card, the players pay one chip to the pool. They must not exchange cards more than once in each round, but they can either refuse or buy any quantity up to five. The cards thrown away are not shown and are not used again till the next deal. In view of the extra cards brought into the game, Ecart√© Nap should be confined to a table of no more than four players, and for the same reason the bids should be made on much stronger hands than the ordinary Nap. Seven-card Nap Each player receives seven cards. There is no exchange of cards and no peep.Hoyle's Card Games, London 1979, pg. 141 Bids of Wellington and Bl√ºcher are not permitted. The players may bid anything from three up to the lot (seven tricks). Mis√®re is played at Seven-card Nap and ranks as next highest bid to Nap. The order of bids with their stakes are: *Three = stake of 3. *Four = stake of 4. *Nap = stake of 10. *Mis√®re = stake of 10. *Six = stake of 18. *Seven = stake of 24. Scoring *Mis√®re: Bidder wins 3 from every player. *Wellington: Bidder wins 10 from every player. *Bl√ºcher: Bidder wins 10 from every player. Penalties *Mis√®re: Bidder pays 3 to every player. *Wellington: Bidder pays 10 to every player. *Bl√ºcher: The stakes are double what they are in Wellington. Bidder pays 20 to every player. *Sir Garnet: The stakes are the same as on the ordinary Nap call. *Ecart√© Nap: At the same stakes it will be found to be more expensive than the latter game, but a great deal more interesting. *Seven-card Nap: Players losing nap, misery, six, or seven pay half stakes.

Demographics India census, Uthukuli had a population of 10130. Males constitute 49.62% of the population and females 50.38%. Uthukuli has an average literacy rate of 68%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 76%, and female literacy is 58%. In Uthukuli, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. In the earlier days, agriculture was the primary activity with hygienic and sweet water available from the multitude of tanks also called \\"Kuttai\\" and \\"Kulam\\". There were green pastures and one could see herds of goats, sheep and buffaloes grazing. This aided development of agriculture-based industries like butter making and Uthukuli was known for its famed butter. There were also many rice and paddy-hulling mills facilitating agriculture-based trade. However, the rapid expansion of textile industries in Tiruppur led to installation of many dyeing units and soon, polluted effluents from the textile city of Tiruppur converted the once fertile Noyyal river into a virtual drain. The polluted river and vanishing tanks had dealt a big, still unrecoverable blow to agriculture, dairy farming, rice mills and paddy-hulling in these areas. Consequently, the young and old of this land are now forced to seek employment opportunities outside this once scenic spot. Apart from water pollution, scarcity of water and steep rise in labor costs in an unorganized labor sector has resulted in agriculture taking a back seat and the traditional hereditary farms called \\"Thottams\\" are fast vanishing. With the rapid expansion of nearby towns such as Tiruppur in the west, establishment of industrial parks such as SIPCOT, TAHDCO, \\"New Tiruppur\\" al within a short distance and overall growth in trade and commerce, this area is now transforming itself into a service support hub. Agricultural lands are now giving way to accommodate handlooms, spinning mills, stone quarries, mining and poultry farms around this place. During the recent years, many schools and colleges have opened in the area. Connectivity: Utthukuli is well connected by Road with frequent bus services to Erode and Tiruppur. A vital rail link of the Indian Railways runs through Utthukuli making it accessible to other parts of the country. Temples:- Kaithamalai Hill Station is famous for its Sri Kaithamalai Vetrivelautha Swami Murugan Desvasthanam Temple. The unique feature of Kaithamalai is the Ther procession that attracts many people especially through the surrounding hills, the only place that a procession goes through hills. The 'Ther' festival held in \\"Thai\\" maasam is popular. Then the God is called as \\"Vetri Velayudha Swami\\" and the Temple is called \\"Kaithamalai.\\" With Vetrivelayutha Swamy's Arul and blessings, Mr. Muthusamy Gounder, a farmer has been performing Pooja's and Arul vaakku in Kalasamurugan Temple at Kannaan Kaadu, northern foothills of Kaithamalai for many years. Lord Murugan has incarnated in the temple many years before when one of the Kalasam of the car (Thiru Ther) of Kaithamalai Murugan Temple rolled down to the Northern side of the hill and settled at our thottam during its Car Festival once. Hence the name, Kalasamurugan People of Uthukuli town and Tirupur used to come and visit this temple near Northern Adivaaram of Kaithamalai. In the year 2009 Kumbaabishekam has been conducted to the newly built temple and many people attended and received the blessings of Lord Kalasamurgan. Mr. Mutthusamy Gounder identified that the Lord Murugan has incarnated in that spot where the KALASAM settled. From that day, he has been doing regular poojas to the Lord Kalasamurugan by temporarily building a temple. With his Arul vaakku, people satisfied that all their worries vanish.

Feldj√§ger riot control exercise. A LAPV Enok of the Feldj√§ger Feldj√§ger Mercedes-Benz Vito patrol vehicle. Feldj√§ger Nissan Patrol. The Feldj√§ger () are the military police of the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces. The term Feldj√§ger, literally meaning field huntsmen or field J√§ger, has a long tradition and dates back to the mid-17th century. History The first modern Feldj√§ger unit was activated on 6 October 1955 when the bill creating the Bundeswehr was signed. The new law called for a military police training company to be established at the former Luftwaffe hospital in Andernach. The original intention was to call the military police units of the Bundeswehr \\"Milit√§rpolizei\\", literally military police. However, objections arose on the part of the federal states which had been given the mission of law enforcement. They wanted the use of the word \\"Polizei\\" to be unique to them and so the name was changed to Feldj√§ger in 1956. Organization The Feldj√§ger corps serves all component forces of the German Federal Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) i.e., German Army, German Navy, German Air Force, Zentraler Sanit√§tsdienst (Joint Medical Corps) and Streitkr√§ftebasis (Joint Support Service). The Military Police Command has its headquarters in Scharnhorst Kaserne in Hanover and is under the operational command of the Bundeswehr's Territorial Tasks Command of the Streitkr√§ftebasis. The Feldj√§ger have three regiments of military police stationed around Germany which are subordinate to the Military Police Command as is the Feldj√§ger School which is also in Hanover, but in the Hauptfeldwebel-Lagenstein-Kaserne (previously Emmich- Cambrai-Kaserne). Missions The 24 Feldj√§ger MP Stations located throughout Germany work around the clock to perform the Feldj√§gers‚Äô main mission which is to be a central point of contact for all soldiers who need assistance. There is a nationwide emergency phone number (0800 190 9999) so Bundeswehr soldiers can contact their nearest Feldj√§ger station at any timeInternet presence of the Feldj√§ger https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/kontaktinformationen-184168. The Feldj√§ger also have four more missions: Maintaining military discipline and order, military traffic control, security operations and investigations. Military discipline To maintain military discipline, the Feldj√§ger perform regular patrols on-post and at places where Bundeswehr personnel congregate. They also patrol at large military events, conduct checks in military installations, assist in collecting and returning stragglers and apprehended soldiers, support the military courts of justice, and assist in collecting and transporting prisoners of war. Controlling military traffic When directing and controlling military traffic, Feldj√§ger work closely with the civilian police to improve traffic safety and protect soldiers. Feldj√§ger traffic missions therefore include route reconnaissance and marking of convoy routes, preparing reports on road accidents with Bundeswehr involvement, directing and controlling military traffic, escorting military oversize or hazardous material vehicles, assisting with the planning and supervision of military traffic, safety checks on military hazardous material vehicles, and setting up military traffic networks. Security operations Feldj√§ger security operations prevent crimes against the German Federal Armed Forces and prevent illegal disturbances of official Bundeswehr ceremonies. In addition, Feldj√§ger can be tasked to protect allied armed forces and provide personal security protection for high-risk Bundeswehr officials. They also secure the command posts of large units, escort VIPs, safeguard conferences and exhibitions, secure military property, assist commanders in physical security matters, and perform riot control missions. Investigations and inquiries Investigations and inquiries range from reporting serious accidents, analyzing matters of official interest, assisting in the investigation of military offenses, and searching for AWOLs. The Feldj√§ger corps also has military working dog (MWD) teams. The dogs are first trained to be patrol dogs and then as sniffer dogs at the Bundeswehr MWD school in Ulmen, around 60km west of Koblenz. Their teams assist in the search for explosives and drugs. Overseas deployments Deployed Units On overseas deployments, Feldj√§ger support the respective contingent by performing military police tasks. They are frequently employed in multinational military police units and not only monitor the behaviour of German soldiers in the area of operations, they also cooperate closely with local authorities, police, organizations, or the military police of other states under the Charter of the United Nations. House searches for illegal weapons and explosives are the day- to-day business in foreign deployments. One mission only performed overseas, for example, is the airport security and border clearance mission. Training To be able to conduct these varied and challenging missions, Feldj√§ger soldiers are sent to numerous training courses at the Feldj√§ger School in Hannover or to specialist courses with the civilian police. One course that all Feldj√§ger must complete is the proficiency test in English, which makes them excellent liaison officers when dealing with other MP forces. Uniform The Feldj√§ger, although a joint force, wear Army uniforms because they originated as an Army branch of service. They wear red berets with a badge derived from the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle, with the motto Suum Cuique (Latin meaning \\"To each his own,\\" a phrase derived from Cicero), as their branch of service emblem. The collar patches and shoulder straps are piped in orange which is the Feldj√§ger branch colour. For routine patrol missions, the Feldj√§ger wear the normal camouflage uniform with \\"Schwarzzeug\\" (black gear) meaning a black MP brassard, with the legend Feldj√§ger in smaller letters, as well as a black belt with black holster, black handcuff holder etc. However for representative purposes, e.g. parades, ceremonies and the motorcycle escort for senior officers, Wei√üzeug is worn. This is the older leather \\"white gear\\" worn before the Schwarzzeug, i.e., white belt, white gloves and a white holster worn on the left side of the belt in the tradition of sword carrying soldiers. Jurisdiction In Germany, the Feldj√§ger only have jurisdiction over soldiers, civil employees of the Federal Armed Forces, and any civilian who enters a military compound. The Feldj√§ger also hold authority over any civilian who enters military jurisdiction if there is some issue of federal security or federal jurisdiction. The Feldj√§ger will also apprehend those violating local laws on local military posts. Feldgendarmerie The Feldgendarmerie (roughly translating to \\"Field Police\\") were the military police units of the armies of the German Empire (including the Wehrmacht) from post-Napoleonic times to the conclusion of World War II.

He was educated at the King David School in Victory Park, Johannesburg and at Crawford College, Sandton. He was a student of the University of Cape Town Drama Department from 1997 to 2000. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Drama, and subsequently completed a Performer‚Äôs Diploma in Speech and Drama. Career Goldin began performing professionally at the age of eleven and had extensive experience in television, film and theatre. Includes Brett Goldin biography.

Film Goldin's film roles include Carl in the 2002 horror film Slash, Lourens in the 2003 romantic drama Proteus, and B-Dog in Crazy Monkey's 2005 comedy feature film Straight Outta Benoni. Theatre In 2004 Goldin wrote and acted in his first stage play, a one-man show titled Bad Apple, which examined what would happen if a Columbine-style killing spree were to occur at a wealthy public school in Johannesburg. The production opened in August 2004 at the Intimate Theatre at the University of Cape Town, directed by Matthew Wild. The production received excellent reviews from the local press. At the time of his death, Goldin was playing the role of Guildenstern in Hamlet at the Baxter Theatre and was set to go to the United Kingdom as part of the South African production to be performed in Stratford-upon-Avon.

At the age of eighteen he already had his degree and was studying law while working in the mail room at the William Morris Agency, quickly moving up the ranks to agent and then head of the theatrical department.David Rensin, The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up (Random House, reprint 2004), , pp. 3‚Äì15. Excerpt available at Google Books. After serving in the Korean War by making training films in Manhattan, he returned to agency work, but in 1953 left to open his own management company, where he represented James Coburn, Robert Culp, Steve McQueen, Mel Brooks, Herbert Ross, Charles Strouse, and Lee Adams. Elkins turned to Broadway theatre producing in 1962 with the Garson Kanin play Come on Strong. The following year, he saw former client Sammy Davis, Jr. performing at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, and approached him about starring in a musical version of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy. When Davis expressed interest, Elkins approached Odets to adapt his 1937 hit play and write the book for the musical (revised by William Gibson when Odets died in August 1963) and hired Strouse and Adams to compose the score. The 1964 Broadway production, directed by Arthur Penn, earned Elkins Tony Award nominations for Best Musical and Best Producer of a Musical. Additional Broadway credits include Oh! Calcutta!, The Rothschilds, and Hedda Gabler and A Doll's House, the latter two with his then-wife Claire Bloom (they married in 1969 and divorced in 1972). Elkins reunited with director Penn for his first film production, Alice's Restaurant (1969) with Arlo Guthrie. This was followed by the Golden Globe-nominated film A New Leaf (1971), screen adaptations of Oh! Calcutta! (1972) and A Doll's House (1973), and Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1979). For television, Elkins produced the documentaries Pippin: His Life and Times (1981), Sex, Censorship and the Silver Screen (1996), An Evening with Quentin Crisp (1999), and Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool (2005). Elins owned the screen rights to the Kurt Vonnegut novel Cat's Cradle, which currently is in development. Elkins was the subject of a 1972 book, The Producer by Christopher Davis. He left behind two sons Johnny and Daniel, his wife Sandi Love and granddaughter Ellen.

It is a day most famous for the battles that occurred on it, most notably the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Because of the St. Crispin's Day Speech in Shakespeare's play Henry V, calling the soldiers who would fight on the day a \\"band of brothers\\", other battles fought on Crispin's day have been associated with Shakespeare's words. Other notable battles include the fall of Lisbon in 1147, the Battle of Balaclava (Charge of the Light Brigade) during the Crimean War in 1854 and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Pacific theatre in 1944. Feast day The feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispinian is 25 October. Although this feast was removed from the Roman Catholic Church's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council, the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Martyrology. The feast remains as a \\"Black Letter Saints' Day\\" in the calendar of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer (1662) and a \\"commemoration\\" in Common Worship (2000). Agincourt The Battle of Agincourt was dramatised by William Shakespeare in Henry V featuring the battle in which Henry inspired his much- outnumbered English forces to fight the French through a speech, saying \\"the fewer men, the greater share of honour\\". The main part of the speech begins \\"This day is called the feast of Crispian\\", and goes on to say that each soldier who survives the battle, will, each year, \\"rouse him at the name of Crispian\\" and say \\"'These wounds I had on Crispin's day'\\", and: Crispin Crispian shall ne‚Äôer go by, From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remember√®d; We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.Shakespeare, W., The Life of King Henry the Fifth, Act 4, Scene 3. Other battles When the Battle of Balaclava was fought on the 25 October 1854, the coincidence was noticed by contemporaries, who used Shakespeare's words to comment on the battle.Deborah Bachrach, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Lucent Books, 1997, p.60. The contrast between the two battles, one a complete victory, the other indecisive and notorious for the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade, has also been noted.Evan Thomas, Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the Last Great Naval Campaign 1941-1945, Simon and Schuster, 2006, p.245. The Battle of Shangani (1893) in the First Matabele War was also fought on that date.Miles F. Shore & Robert I. Rotberg, The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power, Oxford University Press, 1988, p.442. Several battles of World War II were fought on St Crispin's day. In 1942, this day was the third day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, and, on the other side of the world, the Battle of Henderson Field was fought at Guadalcanal. Two years later, in 1944, the Battle of Leyte Gulf was being fought at Cape Enga√±o, Samar Island and in the Straits of Surigao; in the latter, the Japanese fleet was effectively destroyed. Other battles have also been fought on the day, but were not associated with its symbolism at the time. In 1315, a century before Agincourt, Adam Banastre, Henry de Lea and William Bradshaw, led an attack on Liverpool Castle. An early battle of the American Civil War, the First Battle of Springfield, Missouri, was fought on October 25, 1861, and was a Union victory. Another forgotten battle in that war, the Battle of Marais des Cygnes, Kansas (Mine Creek), was fought on that day in 1864.

It produces the Yeo Valley Family Farms range of yogurt and the Roscombe Dairy Ice Cream brand and owns two cafes in Blagdon. The company is owned by its founder Roger Mead's family and is now run by his son Timothy Mead. History Yeo Valley headquarters in Blagdon Yeo Valley founders Roger and Mary Mead began making yogurt using milk from their dairy herd in 1974, selling it from the gate of their farm and to local shops. The present owner is their son, Tim Mead, who took over in 1990 when Roger Mead died in a farming accident. Yeo Valley production facility at Lag Farm in Blagdon Production of organic yogurt was started in 1993, as local farmers who were producing organic milk had difficulty finding a consistent demand for it. Yeo Valley encouraged more local farmers to become organic and form a co- operative, guaranteeing to buy their produce to cope with growing demand. Yeo Valley has won awards for product quality and innovation, and a Queen's Award for Enterprise presented in 2001 for the revolutionary way it worked with its farming suppliers, encouraging them to turn organic and giving them long-term ‚Äòfair trade‚Äô contracts. The firm won another Queen's Award for Enterprise, for sustainable development, in 2006 for its \\"Approach to management with continuing support for sustainable UK organic farming thereby minimising environmental impact\\". In 2010, they launched a ¬£5 million advertising campaign, created by Bartle Bogle Hegarty, featuring the Yeo Valley Rap, using commercial breaks in The X Factor finals, which went viral. Their follow-up campaign which featured a spoof boy band, The Churned, launched during the first X Factor live show on 8 October 2011. They subsequently released the single \\"Forever\\" on iTunes and are running a karaoke-style competition on their Facebook page where the winner will appear on their final ad during the X Factor final. In March 2012, the business was re-branded as \\"Yeo Valley Family Farm\\" by Perry Haydn Taylor's agency Big Fish who redesigned their entire range of over 145 products, relaunched their digital communications and introduced a sales promotion plan. Their new brand identity changed from a droplet of milk to a heart with the words \\"Yeo Valley Family Farm\\" and the strapline \\"Supporting British Family Farms\\" beneath it. In 2010, Yeo Valley Group invested in fields to grow 'Elephant Grass', which the company describes as \\"brilliant stuff [which] regrows every year, absorbing lots of CO2 as it grows.\\" During the winter months, Yeo Valley's headquarters are powered by the bio-fuel. In 2018, the subsidiary Yeo Valley Dairies Ltd was purchased by Arla Foods UK, transferring production of milk, butter, spreads, and cheese under the Yeo Valley brand to Arla . Production of Yeo Valley yogurt, ice cream, cream and desserts remained with Yeo Valley Group Ltd. Products Yeo Valley is the largest organic dairy company in the UK, producing over 2,000 tonnes of yogurt, butter, milk and ice cream each week. The Yeo Valley brand continues to grow and the range now includes: Yeogurt (fruity, low fat and Greek style varieties), milk, children's products (First Yeos, Little Yeos, Yeotubes and Smoothies), butter, cream, Frozen Yeogurt, ice cream, compote and rice pudding.

It also licensed proprietary technologies in the audio/music DSP sector to software manufacturers including Emagic, Steinberg, Digidesign, TwelveTone Systems, Merging, DAVID, AutoDesk/Discreet and others. Headquartered in Karlsruhe, Germany, Prosoniq pioneered the use of artificial neural networks for commercial audio processing. Company history Prosoniq was founded in 1990 by Stephan Sprenger (later married as Stephan Bernsee). It began as a privately held company involved in artificial neural network software development for medical applications. Stephan Bernsee, being a music enthusiast and an avid keyboard player became interested in the application of artificial neural network processing to sound manipulation. He created an automatic audio morphing software for the ATARI 1040ST which was later ported to the Silicon Graphics computers and ultimately to the Apple Macintosh, for which it was sold under the name \\"sonicWORX\\" in the years 1994 - 2004. Distributed by Steinberg and bundled with Sony and Creative Labs hardware, sonicWORX reportedly reached a distribution of over 500,000 copies quickly becoming the most successful product of the company. However, with the PC becoming more popular in the 1990s and sonicWORX being an Apple Macintosh-only software specifically optimized for Mac OS 9 it was finally discontinued in 2004. In 1993 the company was acquired by the rapidly growing UCMG Under Cover Music Group founded by Joachim Keil who drew benefits from custom tailored software solutions for their music production facilities and in turn provided funding for the future research and development of Prosoniq. In 1995 the UCMG network had outgrown its company structure and was split into individual subsidiaries - Prosoniq became a separate company again. This was when Bernhard Bouch√©, a former colleague of Stephan Bernsee joined the company. Both filled the position as CEO and CTO from 1995 - 2004. In 2003 the UCMG who at that time held 54% shares in Prosoniq filed for insolvency, nearly killing Prosoniq in the process. In 2004 Stephan Bernsee retired from the daily business at Prosoniq to concentrate on the development of new technologies at the DSP Dimension, leaving Bernhard Bouch√© in position as the CEO. In 2008 Prosoniq released its OrangeVocoder and audio morphing algorithm as a Cocoa Audio Unit plug-in, as well as a Mac OS X version of its TimeFactory time stretching and pitch shifting software, all developed by their former CTO Stephan Bernsee. At Musik Messe 2009 Prosoniq announced that it would discontinue all Windows software development starting June 2009. Since Prosoniq's CEO alluded that this decision was primarily due to piracy on the Windows platform this created a lot of controversy in the blogosphere. A revised version of the press release that came out a few days later tried to make it more clear that even though piracy was a major problem on both platforms, Prosoniq had always been primarily a Mac software company. At Musik Messe 2009 Prosoniq also announced a successor of its sonicWORX audio editing software designed to extract, process or suppress individual sounds, notes and instruments in a song. This software got widespread coverage in the media when they demonstrated its capabilities (and potential impact on the music industry) by extracting Peter Gabriel's voice from his famous song \\"Don't Give Up\\". According to its developer sonicWORX Pro is based on their PANDORA technology developed in 1996 which allowed automatic suppression of voice in a mono or stereo mix. Limited by the processing power of desktop computers of that era and due to contracts that gave the exclusive right of use to an unknown party the product was never developed into a fully featured end user product until 2009. As of May 2010 Prosoniq sells a scaled down \\"sonicWORX Isolate\\" version that contains the key features demonstrated in the YouTube video at a reduced price. The Pro version with its additional modules has been announced for end of 2010. Within the first days of the FIFA World Cup 2010 Prosoniq came out with a free \\"VuvuX\\" AudioUnit plug in to remove the Vuvuzela noise from the audio commentary without affecting speech and background atmosphere. According to their web site the plug in is not using a notch filter and is based on their sonicWORX de-mixing technology which utilizes statistical signal properties.http://duc.digidesign.com/showpost.php?p=1624534&postcount;=5 In September 2013 Prosoniq announced that it has sold its entire line of products, intellectual property, patent rights and research data to the Hannover-based Zynaptiq startup company, who will continue to offer and maintain their products in the future. Prosoniq also entered liquidation, a process by which a company is brought to an end, and the assets and properties of the company are to be redistributed. Stephan Bernsee, founder of Prosoniq came back as CEO to oversee the process. Liquidation ended in January 2016 with the dissolution of the corporation.

It is bordered by the Nashik districts to the west, Kannad tehsil to the north, Gangapur tehsil to the east, and Ahmednagar districts to the south. Vaijapur is the headquarters of Vaijapur tehsil and also known as the Gateway of Marathwada. History Battle of Palkhed In 1719 Nizam-ul-Mulk who had been appointed the governor of Malva by the Mughal Emperor rose against the Sayyid Brothers and marched to the Deccan. He was followed by a large force under Dilawar ‚ÄòAli Khan, and another army advanced against him from Aurangabad, commanded by the acting viceroy, ‚ÄòAlam ‚ÄòAli Khan. Nizam-ul-Mulk first encountered the former, and Dilawar ‚ÄòAli Khan was defeated and killed in engagement at Ratanpur, sixteen kos from Burhanpur. ‚ÄòAlam Ali Khan was at Fardapur when news arrived of Husain ‚ÄòAli Khan, who was advancing to his assistance from Agra. He preferred, however, to hazard a battle, and was defeated and killed Burhanpur on 1 August 1720. Nizam-ul-Mulk proceeded to Aurangabad, where he was joined by Mubariz Khan, the subadar of Hyderabad, and other officers.22 Nizam-ul-mulk now established himself firmly in the Deccan. Next year saw the downfall of the Sayyad brothers and elevation of Nizam-ul-mulk as prime minister of the Mughal Empire. He took charge of his new post in 1722.1 But tired of court intrigues retired to the Deccan in 1724 when he crushed Mbariz Khan, the governor of Hyderabad in the battle of Sakharkherda which he later renamed Fatteh Kharda fought in October 1724.2 From this date the Nizam became virtually independent of Moghal power. In the next two years the Nizam consolidated his hold in the eastern parts of the province. His real enemies, however, were the Marathas who under the dynamic leadership of Peshva Bajirao were fast growing into an all-India power. In 1727 Nizam-ul-mulk opened his campaign against the Marathas. Bajirao, also made his preparations. He laid waste the district of Jalna in the cold season of 1727, and ‚ÄòIwaz Khan with Asaf Jah's advanced guard partially engaged him. The Marathas retired to Mahur, and then turned rapidly towards Aurangabad and made for Burhanpur followed by ‚ÄòIwaz Khan and ‚ÄòAsaf Jah. After crossing the Ajanta ghat, Bajirao started off for Gujarat; while ‚ÄòAsaf Jah relieved Burhanpur, and returned to Aurangabad with the intention of advancing on Pune. ‚ÄòAsaf Jah went as far as Ahmadnagar, when Bajirav also returned in 1728, and crossing the Kasar Bari ghat, laid waste the talukas of Vaijapur and Gangapur. ‚ÄòAsaf Jah's Maratha allies rendered him but little assistance, and he was much harassed by the enemy. There was also great scarcity of water. The Maratha forces surrounded him at Palkhed where a battle was fought in March 1728 and forced him to sign a treaty by which the Nizam agreed to acknowledge Shahu as the head of the Marathas, and as entitled to collect chauth and sardeshmuki in the Deccan. This treaty is a landmark in the history of the Nizams as the Marathas now obtained a full right to post their officers for the collection of chauth and sardeshmukhi in the territory of the Nizam.Gazetter of Aurangabad district/Aurangabad Geography Vaijapur is located at . Vaijapur, situated on the Narangi river. Vaijapur is located 514 m (1,666 ft) above sea level on the western margin of the Deccan plateau. Toponomy Regarding the origin of Vaijapur which was also known as Baizapur, it is related that a certain Kunbi struck upon a linga while ploughing his field. He installed this linga in a temple to Vaijanath and hence the village came to be known as Vaijapur. Yet another story tells that a certain princess Vaija was converted by a Muhammedan saint and that after her death she was laid to rest in the tomb of that saint. To commemorate this event the village was termed as Vaijapur or Baizapur. The town gives glimpses of its former prosperity in the handsome stone buildings which were erected by the savakars or capitalists of the place. The basement of the structures and the lower half of the walls are constructed of huge stone slabs, cemented and bolted together. Large kiln-burn bricks have been employed in building the upper portions of the walls, and the roofs are terraced. The town had a population of 16,660 in 1971.

Geological setting Deccan trap of the Late Cretaceous-Palaeogene comprising lava flows of basaltic composition, occupy the whole area of the tehsil. Quaternary alluvium occupies the Godavari valley and well exposed south of Vaijapur and comprises gravel beds, sands, silts, and clay.Director General, GSI, Calcutta,District resources map, Aurangabad District, Maharashtra,1999 Soil The most important soils of the district are the black clayey soils on plains interspersed with occasional stretches of shallow soils on ridges. In the north, the soils are shallow and poor and in the south they are deep and fertile and particularly so in the Godavari valley. They are all derived from Deccan trap. The soils can be classified as light, medium and heavy according to the depth, texture and location. Rivers * Godavari -The Godavari forms nearly the entire southern boundary from Dongaon about 3 kilometres above Puntamba to Chendufal. * Narangi River -The Narangi rises on the southern slopes of the water divide to the south of the Maniyad river a little above Naral village and flows past Vaijapur. A little below the latter, it is joined by the Deo nala, flowing from Nasik district. It has a fairly long south by southwesterly course before its point of entry into the Godavari is carried a little down the latter. It is joined by the Chor nala from the west and Kurla nala from the east. * Narali-The Narali nala is a small stream rising above Jambargaon on a low divide and after passing by Virgaon joins the Godavari at Dak Pimpalgaon. *Shivna-The Shivna is a much larger river than any of the streams mentioned above and is a master stream of the western part of Aurangabad district. The Shivna rises on the eastern slopes of the Ajanta range just east of the trijunction of Jalgaon, Nasik and Aurangabad districts above Kalanki village and has a fairly long easterly course as far as Kannad town draining the entire area lying between the Ajanta range on the north and the Surpalnath range on the south. Near Kannad it is joined by several streams draining the Ajanta range and the northern part of the Ellora range, inclusive of the one which rises on the southern slopes of the Satmala hill. South of Kannad, the Shivna after flowing beyond the eastern extremity of the Surpalnath range, is relieved of the restrictive influence of the latter and flows in a southwesterly direction as far as Baigaon, where it turns and flows almost in a southerly course up to Katepimpalgaon. Here it turns and flows in a southeasterly course to join the Godavari at Sawkheda. Thus the river has an initial easterly course, then a southwesterly course, then a southerly course and lastly a southeasterly course. These changing directions of flow depict the lines of structural lines of weakness in the basal rocks. *Bori nala.-The westernmost significant tributary of the Shivna is Bori nala which rises above HilaIpur on the low water divide separating it from the Maniyad. Near Kolhi where the ShiynaVaijapur road crosses the Bori is located the Kolhi Project. After passing by Borsar, Bhaigaon, Parsoda and Karanjgaon it turns and flows southwards to join the Shivna above Katepimpalgaon below the confluence of the Dheku. *Dheku-The Dheku nala rises in the Gorakhnath and Kapilanath hills of the Ajanta range above Dheku. village in Nasik district and flows in a southerly course as Tunki, where it turns and flows in southeasterly course. It covers an area of 410 km2 and lies between latitudes 12¬∞152 N to 19¬∞552 N and longitudes 74¬∞452 E to 75¬∞002 E and falls in the Survey of India Toposheet 46L/ 16 and 47I/13. The Karali nala, a similar stream flowing a little eastwards joins the Dheku. The headworks of the Dheku Project are located below this confluence and upstream of Bhatana village. Below Bhatana the river flows in a more southerly course and after running nearly parallel to the Shivna for more than 20 km., joins the latter upstream of Katepimpalgaon.Aher, K.R. and S.M. Deshpande, 2015. Hydrogeochemical characteristic and assessment of water quality in Dheku basin, Aurangabad, India. J. Applied Geochem., 17: 41-49 * Khari-The Khari nala rises in the Ajanta range and after an initial course in Nasik district enters this district. Soon it is joined by the Chamandara nala and the combined stream flows southeastwards and joins the Shivna near Bharagaon. *Maniyad - Maniyad river the tributaries of the Tapi basin flowing towards north and meet Girna river in Nashik district. A Maniyad reservoir called as Vinayaksagar constructed across this river near Parala village. This reservoir is used for irrigation and supply of drinking water to part of Vaijapur taluka and also for pisciculture on lease basis.http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter/Aurangabad Irrigation projects * Dheku Project The dam is of composite type with a total length of 2583 ft having a maximum height of 48 ft at gorge portion. It is situated on Dheku nala, a tributary of Shivna river near village Bhatana in Vaijapar tehsil.

It consists of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (earlier known as Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park (IGWLS&NP;) and prior to that as Anaimalai Wildlife Sanctuary). It is located above sea level on the Anaimalai Hills range of the Western Ghats. The foothill starts exactly from Monkey Falls which is at a distance of to Valparai. The route to Valparai from the foothills consists of 40 hairpin bends. The Kerala state border town of Malakkappara is at a distance of 26 miles from Valparai. While major portions of the land are owned by private tea companies, large forest areas continue to be out of bounds. History Earliest records of this area are from the year 1846 when K. Gopalsamy Mudaliyar started a coffee plantation here. In 1864, the Karnatic Coffee Company began their coffee plantation here but they could not make it profitable, hence they sold part of their land. In 1875, the roads and guest houses were built by soldiers for the visit of England's Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII. Soldiers were posted here and horses and elephants were used for this purpose. However, the visit was eventually cancelled. In 1890, W. Wintil and Nordan bought a huge portion of land in Valparai from the Madras State Government under the British Raj. Wintil deforested the area and planted tea and coffee. He was assisted by Carwer Marsh, an experienced planter for a salary of 250 rupees. Valparai receives rainfall throughout the year. The typical temperature range in Valparai is 25¬∞C (max) to 15¬∞C (min) in summer and ( and 15¬∞C (max) to 10¬∞C (min) in winter. Geography Valparai is located at . It is a mid-elevation hill station (Ootacamund is considerably higher) and has an average elevation of . Demographics According to the 2011 census, Valparai had a population of 70,859 with a sex-ratio of 1,013 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 5,007 were under the age of six, constituting 2,564 males and 2,443 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 59.68% and 1.75% of the population respectively. The average literacy of the town was 78.47%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The town had a total of 19,017 households. There were a total of 38,440 workers, comprising 107 cultivators, 4,828 main agricultural laborers, 173 in household industries, 29,338 other workers, 3,994 marginal workers, 71 marginal cultivators, 341 marginal agricultural laborers, 62 marginal workers in household industries and 3,520 other marginal workers.

Economy The economy of Valparai largely depends on plantation crops. Valparai has a high concentration of tea and coffee estates. Most of the people living here work in these estates. The Government of Tamil Nadu in collaboration with ITDC initiated the construction of private resort hotels and parks to attract tourists. Valparai is surrounded by many dams and hydro electric power plants. Aazhiyaar Dam is at the foothill of this cluster of mountains. As we go up Upper Aazhiyaar dam is located off the road(which branches off from the main road to Valparai) to Kadampaarai. In Kadamparai there is Kadamparai Dam and beneath the mountain a special kind of power station of TNEB (now TANGEDCO) is located. The road to this Kadamparai Pumped Storage Hydro Electric Power Station branches some 2 miles before and goes through a tunnel which ends up in the vast underground power station complex. The water from the dam flows through one of the dual penstocks and after rotating the turbine it is pumped up to the dam with a powerful motor through the other penstock. Lower Neeraar Dam and Upper Neeraar Vier are located beyond Kadamparai near Kerala border. Tamil Nadu Government's Chinchona estate and factory are located on the road to Neeraar dam. Chinchona is used in the medicine to cure malaria.Sholayaar Dam is located on the western side near Kerala border. It has one power house at the bottom of the dam and the second power house is located few miles away at Manompolli. The water which rotates the turbines goes through the forests in to Parambikulam Dam in Kerala. This water is brought back from Kerala to Tamil Nadu via a tunnel and then the Contour Canal (‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æµ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç) which ends up in Upper Aazhiyaar dam. Transport Winding ghat roads at Valparai Valparai is at a distance of from Pollachi; from Udumalaipettai; from Coimbatore; from Dharapuram; from Tiruppur; from Munnar; from Chalakudy; from Nelliampathi; from Palakkad; from Thrissur. The road from Pollachi to Valparai has 40 hairpin bends. It takes about 2 hours to reach Valparai from Pollachi on State Highway 78. TNSTC operates buses from Valparai to Pollachi, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Udumalaipettai,Dharapuram and Palani. Valparai is connected to Athirappilly Falls by road and is 107 km from Valparai to Chalakudi. Politics The Valparai assembly constituency is a Scheduled Caste constituency and forms part of Pollachi Lok Sabha constituency. Wildlife Valparai receives among the highest rainfall in the region during the monsoons (around June). The plantations in the town are surrounded by evergreen forests. The region is an elephant tract and is known to have many leopards. The drive to the town from Pollachi passes through the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary noted for Bengal tiger, elephants, boars, lion-tailed macaques, gaur, spotted deer, sambar, and giant squirrels. The area is also rich in birds, including the great hornbill, and hosts seasonal migrant birds such as the grey wagtail. The Valparai range is habitat to the Nilgiri tahr, an endemic wild ungulate. These mountain goats inhabit the high ranges and prefer open terrain, cliffs and grass-covered hills, a habitat largely confined to altitudes from 1200 to 2600m in the southern Western Ghats. Their territory extended far and wide all along these hills in the past, but, because of hunting and large-scale habitat destruction, they now exist only in a few isolated sites like the Anaimalai Hills. The human-elephant conflict here is a delicate issue. The tea plantations are a hindrance to the movement of wildlife, particularly elephants who walk large distances to reach water bodies and feeding areas.

It was built between 1739 and 1742 by a Christian missionary to the local Mahicans. It is a National Historic Landmark, designated in 1968 as a rare surviving example of a colonial mission house. It is now owned and operated as a nonprofit museum by the Trustees of Reservations. The town of Stockbridge was established in the late 1730s as a mission community to the Mahicans. John Sergeant was the first missionary, formally beginning his service in 1735. His first house, built in the valley where the Indians lived, has not survived; this house was built in the white community on the hill above the town following his marriage in 1739. It remained in the Sergeant family until the 1870s, and survived Gilded Age developments of the late 19th century. In the 1920s the house was purchased by Mabel Choate, owner of the nearby Naumkeag estate, and moved down into the valley. She and landscape designer Fletcher Steele restored the building, furnished it with 18th century pieces, and designed gardens to Steele's vision of what a colonial landscape might have been. Choate opened the house as a museum in 1930, and donated it (and eventually Naumkeag as well) to the Trustees of Reservations, who operate both properties as museums. Background Before the arrival of British colonists, the area that is now southern Berkshire County, Massachusetts was inhabited by communities of the Mahican tribal confederation.Sturtevant, p. 198 The population of these communities changed over the 17th century as war (sometimes with European colonists and sometimes with the neighboring Iroquois), disease, and migration made them smaller and more diverse. By the 1720s they had sold off most of their tribal lands, and lived in relative peace in two remaining tracts of land on the Housatonic River.Sturtevant, pp. 181, 204‚Äì207 Beginning in the late 1720s the Mahicans became a point of interest to British missionary organizations, because they were seen as potential conversion targets and to counter the possibility of influence on them from Roman Catholic New France. This effort was managed in New England by a commission headed by the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Jonathan Belcher. Belcher suggested in 1730 that the province lay out a town in the Mahican lands, and that London missionary groups pay for a mission there. Funds were allocated for this effort in 1733.Frazier, pp. 18‚Äì19 In 1734 Massachusetts residents in the Northampton area met to organize the mission. John Sergeant, a recent graduate of Yale College, agreed to take on the task, and spent some time that fall among the Mahicans.Frazier, pp. 19‚Äì22 After negotiations involving Governor Belcher and Mahican leaders, it was agreed in 1735 that a mission would be established, and Sergeant was ordained to serve as a minister among them.Frazier, pp. 31‚Äì35 He immediately moved to the Mahican lands and began preaching to and baptizing them.Frazier, p. 36 In 1736 a township of six square miles (16 km2) was formally granted to the Mahicans by the Province of Massachusetts Bay, which would be incorporated in 1739 as Stockbridge.History of Berkshire County, Massachusetts, p. 2:575 Included in the grant were provisions that the minister and schoolteacher receive land grants, and that four English families settle the area, in part to set an example of Christian living for the natives.Frazier, pp. 40‚Äì41 John Sergeant built a modest frontier house in the township,Sweeney, p. 179 and the Indian village grew around this area, which included a meeting house used as a church and school.Wheeler, p. 50 House history In 1739 Sergeant married Abigail Williams, the seventeen-year-old daughter of one of Stockbridge's English colonists. She wanted to live outside the village, so Sergeant had a new house, the subject of this article, built on Prospect Hill, overlooking the village. The date of its construction is uncertain: Sergeant received the land in 1739 after Stockbridge's incorporation,Wheeler, p. 60Vaughan, p. 279 and the house is known to have been built by 1742. The Sergeants lived there until his death in 1749. Abigail remarried and eventually moved out of the house, but it remained in the family. She returned to it after her second husband's death, living with her son's family until her own death in 1791. Jonathan Edwards, a minister who rose to fame during the First Great Awakening, succeeded Sergeant as missionary to the Mahicans (who also became known as \\"Stockbridge Indians\\" and \\"Mohicans\\"), but occupied the first house Sergeant built. That house has not survived, but its site is now marked by a sundial near 23 Main Street. Mission House in ca. 1908 postcard (as it looked in its original location) Sergeant's second house remained in the family until 1879, when the property was sold to David Dudley Field, Jr., a New York City lawyer. Field amassed an estate of some , on which he built a large summer house; the mission house he rented out for several summers to friends. It subsequently fell into disrepair, and was rescued in the 1920s by Mabel Choate, the daughter of New York lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate and owner of the nearby Naumkeag estate, who sought to establish it as a museum in memory of her parents.Karson, pp. 116‚Äì117 Sometime around 1926, Choate purchased the mission house. The house was then disassembled, and its pieces carefully numbered. In 1927 she purchased the lot at 19 Main Street where the house now stands, formerly the site of the Stockbridge Casino; the casino building she sold for $1, and it was moved to its present location east of town, where it serves as the home of the Berkshire Theatre Festival. In 1928 the house was reconstructed at its present location under the guidance of landscape designer Fletcher Steele. The property on which it originally stood is now the site of the Roman Catholic National Shrine of The Divine Mercy. The house's gardens were created between 1928‚Äì1932 by Steele (who was also responsible for significant work on Naumkeag's gardens).Karson, pp. 114‚Äì119 The house was furnished under Choate's guidance with pieces appropriate to the Sergeant period, and opened as a museum in 1930. She donated the house and surrounding property to the Trustees of Reservations in 1948, and bequeathed it part of her collection.Cooper, p. 83 Included in Choate's bequest to the museum was a two-volume Bible that had been given to the Mahicans in 1745 by Francis Ayscough. Choate had in the 1930s convinced the elders of the Stockbridge- Munsee tribe (successors to the Mahicans) to sell her the Bible for display in the museum. Tribe members objected to the sale after it took place, but no action was taken, and the Bible's location was lost to the tribe until it was spotted by tribal members in the museum in 1975. Following negotiations, the Trustees of Reservations returned the Bible to the tribe in 1991.Cooper, pp. 82‚Äì83 House and gardens The mission house now stands on a lot approximately in size. The layout of the house is a standard Georgian center- hall plan, with fireplaced rooms (a parlor to the left, and kitchen to the right) on either side of a central hall, which has a stairway to the second floor. Behind the parlor is an office space where Sergeant would have met with Indians. A diversion from the typical Georgian plan is the presence of a second entrance on the right side of the house, and a narrow hallway running from that entrance to the office. This made it possible for Sergeant's Indian visitors to reach his office without passing through the front of the house. The front door is adorned with a remarkably well-preserved specimen of a Connecticut River valley front door pediment. Outbuildings of the site behind the main house The property features several outbuildings, generally dating from the time of the restoration. A small one-room frame building in the southwest corner serves as a visitor center. Behind the house is a long one- story building that houses museum exhibits, as well as a storage and utility area. It is connected to the house itself by a grape arbor. Northeast of the house is a large barn-like building housing function facilities and a caretaker's apartment. The gardens and outbuildings of the property were designed to Fletcher Steele's vision of what colonial garden should be. He drew on ideas seen in the gardens of George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon to design a property where \\"a hundred forms of industry were carried on\\".Karson, p. 117 Rows of vegetables, fruit trees, and bushes, were lined with flowers for aesthetic appeal, and spaces for carved out that he envisioned would have been used for performing outdoor work such as chopping wood, churning butter, and preparing preserves. Echoing statements made in his Design of a Little Garden, published just a few years earlier, Steele laid out the outbuildings in such a way to provide the homeowners a private retreat.Karson, p. 119 The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It contains a collection of eighteenth-century American furniture and decorative arts. It is open to the public on summer weekends or by appointment.

DRB1 encodes the most prevalent beta subunit of HLA-DR. Several alleles of DRB1 (shared epitope alleles) are associated with an increased incidence of rheumatoid arthritis.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues. The class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DRA) and a beta chain (DRB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins to T helper cells. Class II molecules are constitutively expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages), and could be induced in non- professional APCs.  Gene structure and polymorphisms  The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa. It is encoded by 6 exons, exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DR molecule the beta chain contains all the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities. Hundreds of DRB1 alleles have been described and typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation.  Gene expression  DRB1 is expressed at a level five times higher than its paralogues DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. DRB1 is present in all individuals.

It is the first of two films comprising what has come to be known as Fritz Lang's Indian Epic; the other is The Indian Tomb (Das Indische Grabmal). Fritz Lang returned to Germany to direct these films, which together tell the story of a German architect, the Indian maharaja for whom he is supposed to build schools and hospitals, and the Eurasian dancer who comes between them. Prior works Lang's Indian epic is based on work he did forty years earlier on a silent version of Das Indische Grabmal. He and Thea von Harbou co-wrote the screenplay, basing it on von Harbou's novel of the same name. Lang was set to direct, but that job was taken from him and given to Joe May. Though Lang did not control the final form of that earlier version, it is one of his most revered films. Released in 1921, the original version of Das Indische Grabmal had a running time of 3 hours. For the remake, Lang divided the story into two parts that each run about 100 minutes, a length modern audiences can more easily accept. Plot  The tale begins when architect Harold Berger (Paul Hubschmid) arrives in India and travels to the kingdom of Maharaja Chandra (Walter Reyer), for whom he will build schools and hospitals. En route to the Maharajah's palace, Berger travels with a temple dancer named Seetha (Debra Paget), who has also been invited by the Maharajah, and saves her from a tiger. Seetha, whose father was European, has inadvertently caused the Maharajah to become infatuated with her, but she and the architect begin to fall in love. Predictably, this leads to tension between Chandra and Berger, exacerbated by scheming courtiers who believe that the Maharajah's potential marriage to the dancer could become a pretext for toppling him. The film is filled with action: a highlight is Seetha's ritual dance. At the end of Tiger, Seetha and Berger escape together into the desert just as Berger's sister and her husband, an architect who works with Berger, arrive in Eschnapur. Chandra informs them that he now wants a tomb to be built for Seetha before any further work on the commissioned buildings.

Lang was able to get permission from the Maharana of Udaipur to shoot at many locations that were normally barred to Western film crews. One of these was the floating Lake Palace seen much later in Octopussy.DVD Savant Review: The Tiger of Eschnapur & The Indian Tomb Interiors were shot at the Spandau Studios in Berlin with sets designed by the art directors Helmut Nentwig and Willy Schatz. Releases The two films were edited down into one 95-minute feature courtesy of American International Pictures and released in the US in 1959 as Journey to the Lost Citywith Seetha's dance scenes heavily trimmed, courtesy of the Hays Office. The negatives of Fritz Lang's original films were thought to be lost, but a set was rediscovered. Fantoma Films restored them to DVD format, producing one disc for each film. The discs contain both German and English dialogue tracks, plus other extras. They were released by Image Entertainment in 2001. Trivia * Another film titled Der Tiger von Eschnapur was released in Germany in 1938. It too was based on Thea von Harbou's novel Das Indische Grabmal (The Indian Tomb). The film was directed by Richard Eichberg and written by him along with Hans Klaehr and Arthur Pohl.

DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. New York Times 1 Nov 1975: 31. Plot Federal agent Irving Greenfield confers with a Southern governor about the corruption problem in fictional Dunston County and local boss \\"Bama\\" McCall. Irving intends to find Gator McKlusky, an old buddy of Bama's just out of prison, to help get the goods on Bama. When Irving mentions that \\"cleaning up\\" Dunston County would help his re-election, the governor agrees to give Irving whatever he needs. Irving visits Gator who is back with his father and daughter in Okeefenokee. Gator is disinterested at first, but reconsiders when Irving threatens to put his father in jail and his daughter in foster care. They drive to Dunston, where Gator reunites with Bama at a political rally and is immediately hired as a collector. Gator also locks eyes with TV reporter Aggie Maybank, who is after a story. After treating Gator to a taste of the high life, Bama secretly orders a background check on him, and Gator gets a closer look at Bama's empire: extortion, drugs, and corruption at every level. Then Bama sets Gator up with one of the girls at his brothel, a drugged cheerleader Gator remembers from the rally; she says that all the girls there are minors, which Bama prefers. Disgusted, Gator wants out, and Bama gives him a spiked drink and says he will wake up in his car parked at the county line pointed toward home. As promised, Gator wakes up in his car at daybreak, but now he wants to get Bama. Meanwhile, Irving is trying to fit in by hanging out at a local bar and making conversation when a corrupt cop recognizes him and gets word to Bama's enforcers Smiley and Bones, who injure Irving bad enough to be hospitalized. At the hospital Gator meets Aggie, who wants to see Irving. She tells of Emmeline, a \\"cat lady\\" fired from the Dunston County courthouse after 22 years. Gator and Aggie visit the woman, who mentions secret ledgers in the courthouse basement. That night, using stolen keys, they sneak in and find the ledgers, but a guard hits the alarm, and police quickly converge, but they escape in a patrol car, pick up Irving, and go to Aggie's uncle's beach house nearby. Gator and Aggie slip out to the beach for the night while Irving and Emmeline get acquainted. At daybreak, while Gator and Aggie go to call Irving's boss, Bama and Bones arrive, kill Irving, and set fire to the house to destroy the ledgers; Bones tries to haul Emmeline away, but she breaks free and is killed when she tries to rescue her cats. Seeing the fire, Gator and Aggie hide at a nearby motel. He first calls Irving's boss to come and get them, then Bama to tell him that he has some of the tax records and wants $2,000 and a plane ticket home in exchange for his location; Bama apparently agrees. When they arrive, Bama sends Bones into the room to kill Gator and Aggie, but he is killed by an exploding booby trap set by Gator, who then emerges and chases Bama to the nearby beach. Gator beats him in a fistfight just as a helicopter approaches. Later, Aggie is in a celebratory mood; her story has gone national and CBS wants her to work in New York. Gator tells her he loves her but, realizing they have no future together, he reluctantly heads home.

A native of California, Benson also served as educator, a land office clerk, and was twice elected as Oregon Secretary of State. From this position he became governor after sitting governor George Earle Chamberlain resigned to become a United States Senator. Early life Benson was born in San Jose, California in 1858 to a minister sent west by the Methodist Episcopal Church. His father, Henry Clarke Benson, moved the family to Portland, Oregon to become editor of the Pacific Christian Accord in 1864. His mother was Matilda Williamson Benson, and his older brother Henry Landin Benson was speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives and served on the Oregon Supreme Court.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. Young Frank enrolled in the Portland Academy, and completed his education at the California Wesleyan College (now University of the Pacific in Stockton, California), where he earned an A.B. in 1877, and an A.M. degree in 1882. After college, he returned to Oregon, and began a career in education. In 1880, he became the administrator of the Umpqua Academy in Wilbur, Oregon, a Methodist school that is now closed. Benson was elected Superintendent of Douglas County Schools in 1882, but resigned the next year to become president of the now defunct Normal School in Drain. In 1883, Benson married Harriet Ruth Benjamin, and they had two sons. Benson served as the clerk of the U.S. Land Office in Roseburg from 1894 to 1896. Benson was elected Douglas County Clerk in 1892, and was re-elected in 1896. That year passed the state bar exam, and he began practicing law in Roseburg in 1898. Secretary of State and Governorship In 1906, Benson ran for Secretary of State as a Republican, and was elected. Governor George Earle Chamberlain was elected to the United States Senate halfway through his term in 1909 and resigned as governor. As Secretary of State, Frank Benson was next in the gubernatorial line of succession, and was sworn into office March 1, 1909. (There is no Lieutenant Governor position under the State of Oregon's constitution.) Benson did not resign as Secretary of State, and held both positions in violation of the Oregon Constitution. (Previously, Governor Stephen F. Chadwick, succeeded to the office of governor under similar circumstances in 1877, and held both offices simultaneously in contravention of state law.) Benson collected pay for both offices. As governor, Benson initiated little despite holding the state's two most powerful offices. He did call for a special session of the Oregon Legislative Assembly to fund the operation of certain state institutions, including the state's prison, reform school, mental hospital, school for the blind, and veteran's home. The legislation had been overlooked in the previous (25th Biennial) Session. Benson attempted to resolve a boundary dispute with neighboring Washington. Benson was ill when he assumed the office of governor, then his health appeared to improve. In 1910 he traveled to California for further treatment. On June 15, 1910, Benson telephoned his private secretary, and transferred the Governor's powers to Oregon State Senate President Jay Bowerman until he could return to Salem, which he anticipated would be by July 20, 1910. Bowerman was sworn in as Acting Governor on June 16, 1910. However, Benson did not return and remained in California till his death. Bowerman completed the term as governor. In the fall 1910 election, Benson did not seek a full term of office as governor, but he was elected to another term as Secretary of State. His health failed in Redlands, California, and he died on April 14, 1911. Sources * in the Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States 1789 - 1978.

Vanthali has an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 77%, and female literacy is 61%.  History  Vanthali is a small town in Junagadh district in the Indian State of Gujarat. There are traces that this place was inhabited many many centuries back. It was called ‚ÄòVamanasthali‚Äô or \\"wamansthali\\" in ancient days. After the destruction of Maitraka dynasty of Saurashtra, Sorath area became independent. During this time the Vanthali area was ruled by Walaram, a Chavda Rajput king. Raja Wala Ram had no sons, and the question arose as to who should succeed him after his death. It happened that among the Hindu tribes which had migrated Southward before the encroachments of the Mahomedans was that of the Samas, who settled at Saminagar (now Nagar Thatha), in Sindh. Wala Ram's sister had been married to the chief of the Samma tribe, and her son, Ra Chuda, was selected to follow his uncle at Wamansthali. Accordingly, at Wala Ram's death, in about A.D. 875, Ra Chuda founded the Chudasama dynasty, adding the name of his father's tribe to his own name.

He was the first commander of the Shaked Reconnaissance BattalionSayeret Shaked of Israel's Southern command. Service in the IDF Early years Yarkoni was born Abd el-Majid HidrIzkor Website Citation entry () in the Bedouin village of Na'uraBiography of Amos Yarkoni (east of Afula, in the Gilboa region of northern Israel). His family were Muslim Bedouin of the Mazarib tribe.Biography of Rechavam Zeevi American Jewish year book 1995, Volume 95, The American Jewish Committee, 1995. p. 415 In 1936, at the age of 16, he joined a band which sabotaged the Trans-Arabian Pipeline (Tapline), an oil pipeline running from the Iraqi oilfields to Haifa while Palestine was under British Administration (after Israeli independence, the Tapline was redirected to Sidon, Lebanon). Due to an internal disagreement within the band, Abd el-Majid fled to a Jewish area of Palestine, where he was sheltered by Jews. There, he made contacts in the Haganah through Moshe Dayan. Abd el-Majid kept in touch with Dayan up until the War of Independence. In December 1947, as the war raged, he placed his destiny with the Jews, joining the nascent IDF and changing his name to Amos Yarkoni. Yarkoni served in a number of units during the War of Independence, eventually settling in the Minorities Unit, and proved himself to be an excellent tracker and patrolman, continually astounding his fellow soldiers with his abilities.Biography of Amos Yarkoni In 1953, Yarkoni passed the Officer's Course (his main concern being that the exam was in Hebrew), and went on to become the Commanding Officer of the Minorities Unit. Shaked In 1955, the frequency and effectiveness of Fedayeen attacks being launched from the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip and the Jordanian-controlled Hebron Hills area against isolated Israeli civilian communities increased, and the IDF searched for new ways to eliminate the threat. Rehavam Zeevi, then a senior officer in the Southern Command and in charge of securing the isolated towns of the Jordan Valley, recommended Amos Yarkoni for the task. Yarkoni and Zeevi had met some years earlier, when serving in a joint minorities/Jewish unit, and remained close friends for the rest of their lives. Yarkoni accepted the recommendation, and the IDF tracking and counter-terrorism unit was formed under his guidance and command. The unit was named \\"Shaked\\" (, lit. almond. Because the almond blooms early, the word also has connotations of diligent or perseverant). Shaked was also an acronym for ( _Sh_ omrei _K_ av ha _D_ arom, Guardians of the Southern Border). The unit fielded both Jews and non-Jews, yet when it came to Bedouin recruits, Amos was careful to accept only Bedouins from northern Israel (rather than the south of the country), so that they would not have to fight against their tribal brethren. Yarkoni was based in the Negev for many years, and was involved in countless operations. He was wounded many times, and his body was peppered with bullet and shrapnel wounds. He lost his right hand in combat in November 1959, and was badly wounded in the leg in an explosion. In 1961, after his recovery, Yarkoni was re-appointed as Commanding Officer of the Shaked Battalion. At the time, the Military Commander commented that \\"if Moshe Dayan could be the Ramatkal (Chief of General Staff) without an eye, we can have a Battalion Commander with a prosthetic hand\\".Amos Yarkoni, Shaked Battalion Commander, Shaked Battalion Homepage Even by this stage, many Israelis did not know that Amos Yarkoni was not Jewish: most simply assumed he was a Jew from an Arab country. A running joke among those who did know was \\"Fouad the Jew and Amos the Bedouin\\", referring to the two lead officers of counter-insurgency in the Jordan Valley: \\"Fouad\\" Ben-Eliezer, an Iraqi-born Jew with an Arabic name, and Amos Yarkoni, a Bedouin with a typically Sabra/Israeli name. During the Six-Day War (1967), Yarkoni served on the Sinai front. After years of distinguished service, Yarkoni retired from the IDF in 1969. Death Yarkoni died on February 7, 1991, after a prolonged battle with cancer, aged 70. His old friend, Rehavam Ze'evi, requested that the IDF bury Yarkoni in a military cemetery, despite the fact that as a retired soldier, he was technically ineligible for a military burial. Both then- Minister of Defense, Moshe Arens, and the Head of Manpower for the IDF approved the request. In a mark of respect to Yarkoni, and going against military tradition, Yarkoni's coffin was carried by soldiers of a higher rank than him: six Brigadier Generals ‚Äì his former commanding officers ‚Äì carried his coffin. Behind the coffin marched the President of Israel, Chaim Herzog, political and military leaders, and ordinary Israelis from all walks of life. Also included in the cort√®ge were former members of the Shaked Battalion. Legacy Streets in several towns are named for him (including in Beer Sheva and Haifa). Burial controversy Because Yarkoni was not Jewish, there was a problem with burying him in the Military Cemetery at Kiryat Shaul. (According to Orthodox Jewish burial law, Jews must be buried among Jews.) There was an outcry over the unseemliness of the impediment to burying a hero of the stature of Amos Yarkoni in a Military Cemetery. The matter was resolved quickly when Rehavam Zeevi, Yarkoni's lifelong friend and comrade, purchased a grave in the cemetery for himself, allowing Yarkoni to be buried at the end of the row, and therefore technically not in the Jewish part of the cemetery. The incident over Yarkoni‚Äôs burial, and the increasing numbers of non-Jewish soldiers (especially after the influx from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s) has seen the system of burial for non-Jews in Jewish military cemeteries streamlined.

Sidi Yahya along with Djinguereber and Sankore compose the \\"University\\" of Timbuktu. Sidi Yahya's mausoleum was destroyed on 2 July 2012 following the Battle of Gao and Timbuktu. The sacred legend of this holy site states that the \\"End of The World\\" main gate of Sidi Yahya mosque would not be opened until the last day (of the world), or end times.Defiant Mali Islamists pursue wrecking of Timbuktu, Reuters, 2 July 2012. History Sidi Yahya is named for its first imam and head professor Sidi Yahya (also called Sidi Yahya Tadelsi or Sidi Yahya Al Andulusi). The mosque is located south of the more famous Sankor√© Mosque. Construction of the Sidi Yahya mosque was begun in 1400 by Sheikh El- Mokhtar Hamalla in expectation of a great holy person. It took 40 years to complete. In 1441 Mohamed Naddah, the city-governor of Timbuktu, appointed his close friend Sidi Yahya as its first imam. This marked the beginning of the mosque as a madrassa and a great center of learning for the region. Changes The Sidi Yahya mosque was restored in 1577 or 1578 by Cadi Al Akib. Its original shape was altered in 1939 to reduce its appearance as a military fortress. The original minaret, however, is still in place. Beneath it are the sepulchres of Sidi Yahya and Mohamed Naddah who are said to have died one week apart. The doors of the mosque were also repaired. Notable features Sidi Yahya closely resembles the other famous mosques in Timbuktu (Sankore and Djinguereber). Key differences are it is not as tall and the doors are ornately made reflecting Moroccan influence. The mosque has three rows of pillars facing north-south. The main courtyard is located in the southern part of the city and towered over by the minaret. The courtyard was converted into a cemetery that is no longer in use. The imams of the school are buried in an underground area located to the north of the mosque. Evening and morning prayers are performed there. It also contains lodgings for the mosque‚Äôs guard. A smaller, external courtyard is used as reading space during the celebration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad. Compared to other mosques of Timbuktu, this one benefits from greater care and maintenance. Desecration In the summer of 2012, members of Ansar Dine broke down the doors of the mosque, which according to legend were not to be opened until the end times. They claimed that the reverence for the site was idolatrous, but offered roughly $100 US dollars to repair the mosque.

That piece of data is usually a (unitless) integer or, in some cases, a set of dice. For some types of statistics, this value may be accompanied with a descriptive adjective, sometimes called a specialisation or aspect, that either describes how the character developed that particular score or an affinity for a particular use of that statistic (like Specialisations in Ars Magica or Attribute Aspects in Aria). Most games divide their statistics into several categories. The set of categories actually used in a game system, as well as the precise statistics within each category, vary greatly. The most often used types of statistic include: * Attributes describe to what extent a character possesses natural, in-born characteristics common to all characters. * Advantages and disadvantages are useful or problematic characteristics that are not common to all characters. * Powers represent unique or special qualities of the character. In game terms, these often grant the character the potential to gain or develop certain advantages or to learn and use certain skills. * Skills represent a character's learned abilities in predefined areas. * Traits are broad areas of expertise, similar to skills, but with a broader and usually more loosely defined scope, in areas freely chosen by the player. There is no standard nomenclature for statistics; for example, both GURPS and the Storytelling System refer to their statistics as \\"traits\\", even though they are treated as attributes and skills. Many games make use of derived statistics whose values depend on other statistics, which are known as primary or basic statistics. Game-specific concepts such as experience levels, alignment, character class and race can also be considered statistics.  Types  Attribute advancement screen in a computer role-playing game.  Attributes  An attribute describes to what extent a character possesses a natural, in-born characteristic common to all characters in the game. Attributes are also called statistics, characteristics or abilities. Most RPGs use attributes to describe characters‚Äô physical and mental characteristics, for example their strength or wisdom. Many games also include social characteristics as well, for example a character's natural charisma or physical appearance. They often influence the chance to succeed in a skill or other tests by addition to a die roll or by determining the number of dice to be thrown. As a consequence, usually a higher number is better, and ranges can be as small as 1‚Äì5 (for numbers of dice) or as great as 1‚Äì100 (when adding to results of percentile dice). In some games, attributes represent linearly increasing ability (e.g. in Tunnels and Trolls, where a character can lift 10 lbs per point of Strength) whereas in others a small increase can represent a major gain in ability (e.g. in the DC Heroes/Blood of Heroes system, where +1 to Strength doubles a character's lifting capacity). Some games work with only a few broad attributes (such as Physical or Mental), while others have a greater number of more specific ones. Most games have about 4-10 attributes.The RPGnet article A BROAD VIEW ON PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES by Sergio Mascarenhas, 2005-07-08, links to a PDF file with a table of the attributes used in 30 RPG systems. 26 of them have 4‚Äì10 attributes, two use 3, and one each has 11 and 12 attributes, with an average of 7 (rounded). About two thirds use an even number of attributes. Most games try to give all attributes about the same usefulness to a character. Therefore, certain characteristics might be merged (such as merging a Charisma-type and a Willpower-type attribute into a single Personality attribute), or split into more attributes (such as splitting physical \\"Comeliness\\" from Charisma in the original Unearthed Arcana), or even ignored altogether (for example, Intelligence and Charisma in a hack and slash adventure). In many games, a small set of primary attributes control a larger number of derived statistics such as Armor Class or magic points. During character creation, attribute scores are usually determined either randomly (by rolling dice) or by distributing character points. In some games, such as World of Warcraft, the base attribute scores are determined by the character‚Äôs race and class (however the vast majority of stat points will be obtained through end-game gear/equipment). Because they represent common, in-born characteristics and not learned capabilities (as skills do), in many games they are fixed for the duration of the game. However, in some games they can be increased by spending experience points gained during the game, or as part of the process of \\"levelling up\\".  Advantages and disadvantages  An advantage is a physical, social, intellectual, or other enhancement to a character. In contrast, a disadvantage is an adverse effect. Advantages are also known as virtues, merits or edges and disadvantages as flaws or hindrances, or by the abbreviation \\"disads\\". Many games encourage or even force players to take disadvantages for their characters in order to balance their advantages or other \\"positive\\" statistics. Disadvantages also add flavor to a character that can't be obtained solely by a list of positive traits. Advantages and disadvantages often have a thematic element to them. They often provide a direct relationship between how someone wants to role-play their character and a tangible \\"in-game\\" enhancement to skill or ability rolls. Systems of advantages and disadvantages are often criticized for allowing or even encouraging min-maxing, where a player strives to take disadvantages which have little or no tangible effect on play while using the character points gained from those disadvantages to pay for powerful advantages.  Character points  Character points are abstract units used in some role-playing games during character creation and development. Early role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons assigned random values to a player character's attributes, while allowing each character a fixed number of skills. As a result, characters were at the same time wildly unbalanced in terms of attributes and heavily constrained in terms of skills. Champions (1981) introduced a points- based system of purchasing attributes and skills as a means of improving game balance and flexibility. These points are known as character points, and it has become a feature of numerous later games, most notably GURPS. Usually, a player is allotted a number of points for character creation. A character's attributes (such as high intelligence), skills (such as fixing a car or mechanics), or powers (such as flying) can then be bought for a certain number of points. More powerful abilities or a greater degree of power will require more \\"spending\\" of character points. Later, character points can be earned and spent to improve attributes or skills, or to buy new skills or powers. In some games, such as Champions, these points are experience points; in others, such as Ars Magica, there is a more complicated relationship between experience points and character points.  Powers  A power represents a unique or special quality of a character. In many games, powers are binary on-or-off qualities as opposed to attributes and skills which are usually numeric quantities. The main exception to this is superhero RPGs, where superpowers are often treated as a sort of skill. Superpowers may also use the same rating scale as the primary statistics.  Skills  A skill represents the learned knowledge and abilities of a character. Skills are known by various names, including proficiencies, abilities, powers, talents and knacks. During character creation, a player character's skills are generally chosen from a long list. A character may have a fixed number of starting skills, or they may be paid for using character points. In contrast to attributes, very few games fix a player's skills at the start of the game, instead allowing players to increase them by spending experience points or during \\"levelling up\\". Since some skills are likely to be more useful than others, different skills often have different costs. Skills usually influence a character's chance to succeed by adding to the relevant attribute. In some games (such as GURPS), each skill has a specific base attribute to which it is always added; in others (such as Ars Magica), a skill can be added to different attributes depending on how the skill is being used. Some games (such as Feng Shui) add the base attribute to the skill at character creation time; after that, it is independent of the attribute and is used instead of the attribute rather than adding to it. Most games have a fixed penalty for attempting a task without a relevant skill; older editions of Shadowrun gave a complex network of penalties for using similar skills (such as attempting to pick an electronic lock by using the Computer skill instead of the Electronics skill). The text-based roleplaying game Avalon: The Legend Lives is noted for being the first text based multi user role-playing game to offer a developed profession and skills system . Choosing a profession then conveyed a bank of general skills and guild specific ones each containing a ladder of skills which could be invested in via lessons earned through on-line play. Initially there were around 30 such skills with approximately 17 abilities in each covering a wide range from Riding, Perception, Thievery or Demonology. As of 2015 Avalon possesses 66 Skills with a staggering 2194 distinct abilities developed over its 26-year tenure.  Traits  A trait represents a broad area of expertise of a character. Traits are rarely drawn from a predetermined list; rather, the player chooses some description during character generation. For example, a squash-playing history professor with a knowledge of fine wines might have the traits \\"History\\", \\"Squash\\" and \\"Oenology\\". In terms of a more fine-grained system of statistics, a single trait would often be represented by a group of skills, one or more advantages and attributes, or a combination thereof. The first major role-playing game to use traits was Over the Edge. Some systems, such as Castle Falkenstein and HeroQuest, use traits as the only type of statistic, although they may use some other term for them, such as abilities.  Derived statistics  Many games make use of derived statistics: statistics whose values are determined only by the values of other, \\"basic\\" statistics. They often represent a single capability of the character such as the weight a character can lift, or the speed at which they can move. Some are unitless numbers, but often they use real-world units of measurement (such as kilograms or metres per second). Derived statistics are often used during combat (e.g. hit points, Armor Class and initiative). Basic and derived statistics are also called primary and secondary statistics, respectively. In games which use such concepts, derived statistics are often modified by the character's race and class. In addition, certain in-game methods such as spells or magical items might raise or lower these statistics temporarily.  Interdependencies between statistics  Some games define various interdependencies between statistics of different categories, as well as within categories. The most common are: ; Prerequisite : Only if statistic A has a value of at least x, statistic B may exceed value y. (Where y is often 0 or none.) For example, a character class may require certain minimum attribute scores, or a spell may require a minimal level of magical talent. Learning some esoteric skill often requires knowledge of another one at an \\"expert\\" level or possession of a certain advantage: In GURPS Martial Arts, for example, \\"cinematic\\" or \\"mystical\\" martial arts abilities require a special advantage, Trained by a Master. ; Limitation : If statistic A has a value of at least x, then statistic B cannot exceed value y. This is the opposite of prerequisite. (Only if statistic A has a value of at most x, statistic B may exceed value y.) For example, a character class may be disallowed for certain races, or one of the game effects of a disadvantage (say, Unfit), could be to limit a certain attribute (Constitution or Health in the example) to a certain maximum value (no more than average). ; Bonus or base value : If statistic A has a value of x, then the value of statistic B is increased by (or starts at) y. The term base value is preferred if y = x or if y is large compared to B's value. Higher scores in an attribute often grant bonuses to a group of skills. ; Derivation: If statistics A and B have values of x and y, respectively, then the value of statistic C is a function of (x, y). Derived (or secondary) statistics are discussed elsewhere.

It tells of how the animals of the Bean Farm went to rescue some of their animals friends who went on an expedition to the North Pole.Freddy Goes to the North Pole: product description Plot summary In the beginning, Freddy had the idea to establish a tourism company called Barnyard Tours Inc. The animals agreed, and the company was formed. Animals could pay for a tour with food, or by doing work for Mr. Bean. Soon, however, Freddy and Jinx, the cat, were sick and tired of conducting the tours. Freddy suggested a trip to the North Pole. So they and four other animals set off. A year passed, and the animals left began to worry. A mob formed in the barnyard triggered by a speech by Charles, the rooster. Then, Ferdinand, a crow from the expedition, came back and organized a rescue party. He said they had gone on a ship and crew were planning to eat Freddy. The sailors had said that they might try going to Santa Claus‚Äô house. Later, in the woods of Canada, two children and a bear joined the rescue party. However, it soon was discovered that Ferdinand forgot to bring food and clothing for the animals. Everything looked grim for Ferdinand for a minute, but he suddenly came up with the idea for a lecture tour. The animals of the woods brought in food and clothing they found in the woods. Also, a few weeks later Charles and Jack, a dog, wandered away and were captured by some wolves. The animals, Charles and Jack, managed to drive the wolves away with the help of some ants. They finally arrived at Santa Claus‚Äô house. The animals found Freddy there and also found a problem: The sailors were trying to turn Santa Claus's irregular workshop into an ordinary, assembly line factory. The animals tried to make the sailors leave. They played ghosts, but one sailor wasn't scared. Then, Freddy sent the captain, Mr. Hooker, a treasure map. He thought all the sailors would go with him, but instead, he tried to get all of it for himself. Freddy and Jinx chased after him and took it back. Later, the whole crew of the ship was shown the map. The sailors left and Santa Claus's workshop went back to normal.

In Vasna Borsad INA, 17% of the population is under 6 years of age. The population mainly survives on farming and agriculture, but in the last ten years many families have migrated from this village to cities and overseas. Vasna has the most NRI families out of the Chovis Gam Patidar Samaj. Darmaj is a short distance away and Borsad is nearby, too. Vasna has recently had proper sewage system put in place as well as having the most reliable mains power supply for a village. Other Chovis Gam territories don't have solid paving, even to this date, but Vasna, due to its overseas NRI population amounts, have had funding in place to provide this facility throughout the main parts of the village.  Places of interest  In the centre of the village there is a big house around three stories high, with a great Krishna Statue atop it, and this house can be seen from any rooftop in Vasna. This house was constructed in the late 1960s or early 1970s. There are also many temples which are popular attractions. Trimandir: This temple has been built based on the non-sectarian concept developed by Param Pujya Dada Bhagwan to demonstrate that the essence of all religions is the same, to achieve self-realisation.

Family background Sevier was born in Virginia in 1747. He was named after his father, Valentine 'The immigrant' Sevier, who had taken passage from London to America and settled in Augusta County, Virginia in an area which is part of Rockingham County today. His older brother, John Sevier, became the first governor of the state of Tennessee. As a young man, Sevier moved over the Appalachian Mountains to join the Watauga Association when it was established at present day Elizabethton, Tennessee. Service During the American Revolutionary War, Sevier fought against the British Regular and Loyalist forces. His younger brother, Robert Sevier, commanded a company of Overmountain Men at the Battle of Kings Mountain and died during battle. Sevier also fought in many actions against Native Americans across the Washington District (part of the eastern division of Tennessee). During the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars Sevier attained the rank of colonel. Life on the frontier Following the war, Sevier moved to the Clarksville area. Here, the family was subjected to frequent attacks by Native Americans. In 1792 he built a small rock fortress for his family and others to take refuge in during these attacks. The structure still stands in the \\"Boot Hill\\" section of Clarksville above Red Paint Hill. It was here that the family was attacked on November 11, 1794. Several family members were wounded or killed, including a 12-year-old daughter who was scalped but survived. The fortress is called Sevier Station, and is marked by a historic marker. Sevier's three sons had been killed two years previously by a raiding party under the Chickamauga Cherokee leader, Doublehead, whose band was based at the head of Muscle Shoals.

It affects lymphocyte apoptosis. It is a rare genetic disorder of abnormal lymphocyte survival caused by defective Fas mediated apoptosis. Normally, after infectious insult, the immune system down- regulates by increasing Fas expression on activated B and T lymphocytes and Fas-ligand on activated T lymphocytes. Fas and Fas-ligand interact to trigger the caspase cascade, leading to cell apoptosis. Patients with ALPS have a defect in this apoptotic pathway, leading to chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and secondary cancers. Presentation All people with ALPS have signs of lymphoproliferation, which makes it the most common clinical manifestation of the disease. The increased proliferation of lymphoid cells can cause the size of lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes and spleen to increase (lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, present in respectively over 90% and over 80% of patients). The liver is enlarged (hepatomegaly) in 30 - 40% of patients. Autoimmune disease is the second most common clinical manifestation and one that most often requires treatment. Autoimmune cytopenias: Most common. Can be mild to very severe. Can be intermittent or chronic. These include: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Autoimmune neutropenia, Autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Other signs can affect organ systems similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (least common, affecting <5% of patients) Symptoms of the nervous system include: Autoimmune cerebellar ataxia; Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome; transverse myelitis. Gastrointestinal signs like autoimmune esophagitis, gastritis, colitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis can be found or (Dermatologic) Urticaria, (Pulmonary) bronchiolitis obliterans, (Renal) autoimmune glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome. Another sign are cancers such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas which appear to be increased, possibly due to Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus-encoded RNA-positivity. Some carcinomas may occur. Unaffected family members with genetic mutations are also at an increased risk of developing cancer. Genetics This condition is usually caused by mutations in the FAS gene. Rarely cases due to mutations in other genes including the FAS ligand gene have been reported.Magerus-Chatinet A, Stolzenberg MC, Lanzarotti N, Neven B, Daussy C, Picard C, Neveux N, Desai M, Rao M, Ghosh K, Madkaikar M, Fischer A, Rieux-Laucat F (2012) Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome caused by a homozygous null FAS ligand (FASLG) mutation. J Allergy Clin Immunol Diagnosis Diagnostic algorithm The old diagnostic criteria for the illness included: Chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation, elevated peripheral blood DNTs and defective in vitro Fas mediated apoptosis. The new criteria require chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation (over six months lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly), elevated peripheral blood DNTs. A primary accessory in diagnosis is defective in vitro Fas mediated apoptosis and somatic or germline mutation in ALPS causative gene (FAS, FASL, CASP10). The secondary accessory in diagnosis are elevated biomarkers (plasma sFASL over 200 pg/ml, plasma IL-10 >20 pg/ml, plasma or serum vitamin B12 >1500 ng/L, Plasma IL-18 >500pg/ml) and immunohistochemical findings on biopsy consistent with ALPS as determined by an experienced hematopathologist. Another sign is autoimmune cytopenias and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and a family history of ALPS or non- malignant lymphoproliferation. A definitive diagnosis is chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation and/or elevated peripheral blood DNTs plus one primary accessory criterion. A probable diagnosis is the same but with one secondary accessory criterion.

No longer considered a subtype of ALPS but distinct disesase Treatment Treatment is most commonly directed at autoimmune disease and may be needed to treat bulky lymphoproliferation. First line therapies include corticosteroids (very active but toxic with chronic use), and IVIgG, which are not as effective as in other immune cytopenia syndromes. Second line therapies include: mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept) which inactivates inosine monophosphate, most studied in clinical trials with responses varying (relapse, resolution, partial response). It does not affect lymphoproliferation or reduce DNTs, with no drug-drug interactions. This treatment is commonly used agent in patients who require chronic treatment based on tolerance and efficacy. It may cause hypogammaglobulinemia (transient) requiring IVIgG replacement. Sirolimus (rapamycin, rapamune) which is a mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor can be active in most patients and can in some cases lead to complete or near-complete resolution of autoimmune disease (>90%) With this treatment most patients have complete resolution of lymphoproliferation, including lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (>90%) and have elimination of peripheral blood DNTs. Sirolimus may not be as immune suppressive in normal lymphocytes as other agents. Some patients have had improvement in immune function with transition from cellcept to rapamycin and it has not been reported to cause hypogammaglobulinemia. Hypothetically, Sirolimus may have lower risk of secondary cancers as opposed to other immune suppressants and requires therapeutic drug monitoring. It is the second most commonly used agent in patients that require chronic therapy. It is mostly well tolerated (though side effects include mucositis, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia, delayed wound healing) with drug-drug interactions. It has better activity against autoimmune disease and lymphoproliferation than mycophenolate mofetil and other drugs; however, sirolimus requires therapeutic drug monitoring and can cause mucositis. A risk with any agent in pre- cancerous syndrome as immune suppression can decreased tumor immunosurvellence. Its mTOR inhibitors active against lymphomas, especially EBV+ lymphomas. The Goal serum trough is 5-15 ng/ml and can consider PCP prophylaxis but usually not needed. Other treatments may include drugs like Fansidar, mercaptopurine: More commonly used in Europe. Another is rituximab but this can cause protracted hypogammaglobulinemia and a splenectomy but there is a >30% risk of pneumococcal sepsis even with vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis References  External links  Category:Lymphocytic immune system disorders Category:RASopathies Category:Syndromes with tumors ","title":"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome"},{"id":"5812987","text":"Vastrapur is an area in Ahmedabad district in the Indian state of Gujarat.

Edward Whymper was planning to climb the mountain with Lord Francis Douglas, when he heard that Hudson (together with Michel Croz) had the same objective. Whymper wrote: The accident occurred because Hadow slipped on the descent not far from the summit, pulling Croz, Hudson and Douglas down the north face of the mountain; the rope between these four and the other three members of the party (Whymper and the two Zermatt guides named Peter Taugwalder, father and son), snapped, saving them from the same fate. Some have blamed Hudson for insisting on the presence of the inexperienced Hadow in the party, and for not checking the quality of the rope or the boots Hadow was wearing. Hudson's body was retrieved from the Matterhorn glacier and was buried in the Zermatt churchyard.

In a career which lasted from the spring of 1902 until October 1904 he ran twenty times and won sixteen races. He was a leading British two-year-old of his generation, winning the 2,000 Guineas Stakes The Derby and the St. Leger Stakes. He won another series of major races as a four-year-old before being retired to stud, where he had success in both Europe and North America. Background Rock Sand was a small brown horse bred by his owner Sir James Miller at his Hamilton Stud in Newmarket.Ahnert, Rainer L. (Ed. in Chief), \\"Thoroughbred Breeding of the World\\", Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 Rock Sand was sired by Sainfoin, the winner of the 1890 Derby, who was bred by Queen Victoria. He was the first foal of Roquebrune by St. Simon who won two races and was a half-sister to Epsom Oaks winner Seabreeze. Rock Sand was trained throughout his career by George Blackwell at Newmarket, Suffolk. Rock Sand was a notably bad mover in his slower paces: those unfamiliar with his gait frequently assumed that he was lame when he trotted or cantered to the start before his races. He was also criticised early in his career by some observers who felt that he was too small to be a Derby winner. Racing career 1902: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, Rock Sand began his racing career by winning the Bedford Stakes at the Newmarket Spring meeting. He then won the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom, the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket on 17 July and the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in September, ridden on each occasion by the American Danny Maher. By the end of summer he was being described as the best two-year- old of the season. At Newmarket on October he suffered his first defeat when beaten as the even money favourite for the Middle Park Stakes. The race was won by his stable companion Flotsam (ridden by Maher) with Greatorex second and Rock Sand, ridden on this occasion by William Lane third. Two weeks later Rock Sand defeated the King's colt Mead by three lengths to win the Dewhurst Stakes with Greatorex third. As the horses went into the winter break, Rock Sand was 4/1 favourite for the following year's Derby, with Flotsam the second choice. 1903: three-year-old season On his first race as a three-year- old Rock Sand won the Bennington Stakes, a minor race at Newmarket's Craven meeting. In the 2000 Guineas on 29 April he started 6/4 favourite in a field of eleven runners, with Sermon on 6/1 and Flotsam on 7/1. Ridden by the American jockey Skeets Martin he tracked Flotsam in the early stages before moving into the lead just after half way and winning easily by one and a half lengths from Flotsam, with Rabelais third. The Sportsman magazine noted that Rock Sand was a rather lazy colt who \\"does not gallop until he is compelled to\\". Danny Maher ca. 1900. The Derby at Epsom attracted a field of seven runners, the smallest of the twentieth century. Rock Sand was ridden by Danny Maher (right) and started favourite at 4/6 in front of a crowd which included the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales. Rock Sand started quickly and took an early advantage before the Royal colt Mead took over and led until just before the turn into the straight, where Maher moved Rock Sand back into the lead. The French-trained second favourite Vinicius came from well back in the field to emerge as the main challenger in the last quarter- mile but could never catch Rock Sand who won by two lengths, with Flotsam two lengths further back in third. It was the first of three Derby winners for Maher and the third successive win for an American jockey following the wins of Lester Reiff in 1901 and Skeets Martin in 1902. Rock Sand followed up his Derby win with a run at Royal Ascot where he took the St. James's Palace Stakes over one mile from three \\"moderate\\" opponents at odds of 1/10. He then faced older horses for the first time when he was sent to Sandown for the Eclipse Stakes. The 1903 running of the Eclipse Stakes on 17 July was one of the notable races of the early 20th century when Rock Sand faced the previous year's Derby winner Ard Patrick and the filly, Sceptre who had won the other four British Classic Races in 1902. The race thus brought together \\"the three best horses in England\\", and perhaps \\"the most valuable field of horses that ever started in a race in any part of the world\\". The King was among the immense crowd which was drawn to Sandown for the \\"Battle of Giants\\". The odds at the start were 5/4 Rock Sand, 7/4 Sceptre and 5/1 Ard Patrick. Rock Sand disputed the lead with Oriole in the early stages but was challenged and overtaken by Ard Patrick before the turn into the straight. He faded in the closing stages and finished third, beaten a neck and three lengths by Ard Patrick and Sceptre who fought out a \\"desperate finish\\". The contest was favourably compared to the race for the 1887 Hardwicke Stakes between Ormonde, Minting and Bendigo. On 9 September at Doncaster, Rock Sand attempted to complete the Triple Crown in the St Leger. Only four horses opposed him and he was sent off the 2/5 favourite. He reportedly had thing \\"all his own way\\" and won easily by four lengths from William Rufus, with Mead in third. Rock Sand's final start of the season came in the ¬£10,000 Jockey Club Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Newmarket on 1 October. Ard Patrick had been retired by this time but Rock Sand was opposed by Sceptre. Rock Sand was beaten four lengths by the filly, who was conceding eighteen pounds‚Äì nine pounds more than weight-for-age‚Äì and won with \\"consummate ease\\". Rock Sand's earnings of ¬£22,633 in 1903 enabled his sire Sainfoin to his best position of second on the list of leading sires. 1904: four-year-old season On his four-year- old debut, Rock Sand ran against Sceptre again in June over the Derby course and distance in the Coronation Cup, a race which also featured the first meeting between Rock Sand and his contemporary Zinfandel, a colt whose engagements in the previous year's classics had been rendered void by the death of his owner Colonel Harry McCalmont. Zinfandel won easily from Sceptre, with Rock Sand third. Rock Sand avoided Zinfandel for the remainder of the season and was unbeaten in his remaining five races. He won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot, beating Sceptre for the first time. He was then an easy, odds-on winner of the ¬£10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket on 30 June from Saltpetre (who won the Goodwood Cup on his next start) and William Rufus. Sceptre was not allowed to run in the race as her former owner, R. S. \\"Bob\\" Sievier had been \\"warned off\\" (banned from any involvement in racing). It was reported that Lillie Langtry, the former mistress of King Edward VII, eased her financial difficulties by winning ¬£100 on the race. A few days later Rock Sand added the Lingfield Park Stakes, beating Loch Ryan and Henry the First. and later in July he won the Newmarket First Foal Stakes. Rock Sand ended his racing career in the ¬£10,000 Jockey Club Stakes on 29 September in which he defeated Henry the First and William Rufus, with the Derby winner St. Amant unplaced. Before the race his action looked even worse than usual as he hobbled to the start \\"like a cripple\\", but won impressively and was given an enthusiastic reception by the Newmarket crowd which greeted the joint-favourite's success with \\"deafening cheers\\". Rock Sand's winning prize money of ¬£19,719 made him the highest earner of the British season ahead of the filly Pretty Polly. He was kept in training until the spring of 1905 with the aim of running in the Ascot Gold Cup, but persistent tendon trouble forced his retirement. Assessment Despite winning more top class races than most Derby winners, Rock Sand was never rated very highly, although it was acknowledged that he was \\"unmistakably... a high-class racehorse\\". His success in the Triple Crown was seen as arising from the generally poor quality of his rivals and the enforced absence of Zinfandel an impression reinforced by his defeat by Zinfandel in 1904. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rock Sand an \\"average\\" Derby winner. Stud record Rock Sand retired to stud in England, but when James Miller died in 1906 he was put up for sale. He was bought for ¬£25,000 for breeding purposes by the American, August Belmont Jr., who sent him to his Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. His arrival in the United States was not trouble-free as it took more than an hour before he could be persuaded to walk down the gangplank from the ship which had brought him to America. In Kentucky, he sired: * Damrosch, winner of the 1916 Preakness Stakes * Friar Rock (won Belmont Stakes) * Gun Rock, a stallion of the United States Army Remount Service that was chosen in the 1920s to be the mascot of what is now known as the University of California, Davis * High Rock (won WATC All-Aged Stakes and WATC Grandstand Plate) * Mahubah (1910), the dam of Man o' War * Qu'Elle Est Belle II (Prix de Diane) * Rock View (USA Withers Stakes) * Spun Glass dam of Broomspun (Preakness Stakes) winner * Sun Queen dam of Coventry (Preakness Stakes) winner * Tracery (1909) won St. Leger Stakes etc.; sire of a number of British champions, including 1923 Derby winner Papyrus. The Hart‚ÄìAgnew anti-betting legislation implemented by the Republican controlled New York Legislature under Governor Charles Evans Hughes eventually led to the complete shutdown of horse racing in New York state and forced Belmont to sell Rock Sand to a syndicate who shipped him to a stud farm France in 1912. He became a difficult horse to manage, eating his bedding straw and kicking the walls of his stable. He died of heart disease on 20 July 1914. His skeleton can be seen in the Gallery of Comparative Anatomy & Paleontology at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, France.

A native of Montreal, Quebec, Laing was the youngest in a family of five children. His eldest sister Carol was followed by triplet brothers, Jeffrey, Leslie, and Stephen, and then by Corky. According to Corky, his brothers called him \\"Gorky\\" because they could not pronounce his given name \\"Gordon\\". \\"Gorky\\" eventually morphed into Corky, a moniker which has remained with him throughout his career. Getting his break playing drums for vocal group The Ink Spots in 1961, he later played in a group called Energy, who was produced by Cream collaborator and Laing's future bandmate Felix Pappalardi. Laing left Energy in 1969 to replace drummer N.D. Smart in a hard rock outfit and heavy metal forerunner Mountain, who, with Laing at the drum kit, released three albums and the classic song \\"Mississippi Queen\\" between 1970 and 1971. Musikhalle Hamburg, April 1973 After the band's first breakup the following year, Laing and Mountain bandmate Leslie West went on to form blues-rock power trio West, Bruce and Laing with former Cream bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce. West, Bruce and Laing produced two studio albums and a live release before Mountain reformed without Laing in 1974 and released two more albums, Avalanche (with Laing) and the live Twin Peaks (without Laing), only to break up again shortly after. The band would once again reconvene with Laing in 1985 upon the release of Go For Your Life, and Laing has continued with them to this day, most recently working on the band's 2007 Bob Dylan cover album Masters of War. In late 1977, he recorded an album with John Cale (former Velvet Underground member), Ian Hunter (from Mott the Hoople) and Mick Ronson. This album was not released. In addition to Mountain, he has recorded as the group Cork, with Spin Doctors guitarist/vocalist Eric Schenkman and Noel Redding, formerly bass guitarist of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late 1975, he played congas on several tracks on Bo Diddley's all-star album The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll. In 1991, he was featured on Men Without Hats's cover version of The Beatles's song \\"I Am the Walrus\\" on drums. This is available on the Sideways album. 2000s In 2003, Laing and Leslie West authored Nantucket Sleighride and Other Mountain on-the-Road Stories, a chronicle of their time with Mountain in its heyday and their careers in the years following. Laing lives in Toronto's historic Liberty Village and was interviewed for the 2006 documentary film, Liberty Village - Somewhere in Heaven. He contributed the music for the film from recordings of his band Cork. In 2007, Laing recorded Stick It!, the audio version of his memoirs with Cory Bruyea in Oakville, Ontario.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1981 though Frontier Records. While the band's eponymously titled debut EP, released earlier that year, had been filled with radical leftist lyrics, Dance with Me moved away from politics in favor of horror film- and gothic-inspired subject matter. The album includes T.S.O.L.'s most well-known song, the necrophilia-themed \\"Code Blue\\". Following the punk rock revival of the 1990s, Dance with Me was re- released by Epitaph Records in 1996 and by Nitro Records in 2007. Recording and release Following the release of the T.S.O.L. EP through Posh Boy Records in spring 1981, T.S.O.L. moved to Frontier Records to record a full- length album. This led to a dispute with Posh Boy owner Robbie Fields, who claimed the band had not honored their commitment to record a second EP for his label. The issue was settled several years later, with the band received back payments of royalties from Posh Boy while the label was able to purchase the master recordings and publishing rights to T.S.O.L.'s 1982 EP Weathered Statues. Dance with Me was recorded at Redondo Pacific Studios in Redondo Beach, California with record producer Thom Wilson, who was initially hesitant to work with T.S.O.L. because of their violent reputation: \\"I was very apprehensive about it,\\" he recalled in 1998, \\"People said to me, 'Are you sure you want to do this? They beat people up. However, he found that the band members took the recording process seriously and worked hard, the lone quirk being singer Jack Grisham's insistence on sitting while he recorded his vocal tracks. Wilson engineered and mixed the recordings, and they were mastered at K Disc. Paintings by artist Mark Wassman were used for the front and back cover, while photos for the back cover and insert were taken by photographers Glen E. Friedman and Edward Colver. The album was released through Frontier in 1981 as catalog number FLP004.Blush, p. 326. Grisham credited himself as Alex Morgan on the sleeve, following a tradition of using a different pseudonym on each release both to confuse audiences and to hide his true identity from the police.Blush, p. 94. As part of his Alex Morgan persona, Grisham wore stage makeup resembling that of Adam Ant, though this was not entirely new: \\"I was wearing makeup when I was a skinhead three years ago, just to bum people out\\", he later recalled. Music and lyrics Lyrically, Dance with Me diverged from the radical leftist political themes of the band's debut EP in favor of horror film- and gothic-inspired topics. Steven Blush, author of American Hardcore: A Tribal History, writes that \\"T.S.O.L. were always a step ahead of the audience. Their self-titled EP with 'Abolish Government' was lauded for its political conviction. By 1981, [singer Jack Grisham] was smearing makeup on his face to affront the surf punks, and people called it 'goth'.\\" According to Grisham, the band had been moving in a horror-inspired direction prior to the T.S.O.L. EP, and already had some of the Dance with Me material in their repertoire before recording the EP but withheld it for later use: > People talk about how T.S.O.L. changed so much from the first EP to Dance > with Me,from political punk to gothic punk. But we had all those songs > before we did the first EP. If you look on the first EP cover, my hair's > sticking straight up, I'm wearing some Frankenstein suit, and I've got black > makeup all over my eyes. We knew Posh Boy was gonna burn us, but we wanted > to put out a record. So it was like, 'Let's give him these, and we'll save > the good stuff for later.' During Dance with Me, we were labeled > gothic/horror...whatever. Yeah, we dug up some graves but we dug up graves > even before the first record. All that crap, like breaking into mortuaries, > we'd done that before. Look at the first T.S.O.L. record, it thanks the > church PA: we'd been busting into churches and desecrating the altars. We'd > steal the PA and spraypaint the altars. Photographer Edward Colver, who contributed photos for the album's insert, remarked \\"Back then, we called it death rock. It wasn't called goth yet. T.S.O.L., Christian Death, 45 Grave, and even Social Distortion started that whole mess. They all wore lots of pancake makeup and pissed off a lot of the punk rockers in the process.\\"Blush, pp. 93‚Äì94. Reception and legacy According to Blush, \\"Dance with Me's impact confirms SoCal hardcore as a source of the American goth scene.\\" Bradley Torreano of Allmusic called the album \\"a phenomenal gothic punk record that paved the way for bands like the Misfits and The Lords of the New Church to make similar music.\\" In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Adam Bregman gave the album four stars out of five, calling it \\"no mere footnote in punk rock history\\", \\"slam pit-inducing, infectious stuff\\", and \\"loaded with fine numbers\\": \\"Other than the Misfits, no band has combined gothy subject matter and punk rock barre chords as well as T.S.O.L., who hit the nail on the head with this classic 1981 recording.\\" Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times included Dance with Me in his list of \\"Essential Albums, '78‚Äì'98\\", celebrating twenty years of Orange County punk and alternative rock: > Dance with Me had little in common with the T.S.O.L. EP. Its cavalcade of > moods and themes was kept on track by the dark authority of the playing. A > spooky mood prevails on Dance with Me, underlined by a graveyard scene on > the cover. The album inhabits a Halloween fun-house hall of horrors on the > title song and \\"Code Blue\\", in which Grisham plays a necrophiliac giving a > hilarious, if explicit, account of his preferences. It veers toward film > noir for the cloak-and-dagger mystery \\"Triangle\\" and encompasses earnest > accounts of embattled individualism. In the wake of the 1990s punk rock revival, Dance with Me was re-released in 1996 with slightly altered artwork through Epitaph Records, who had also released albums by Grisham and guitarist Ron Emory's band The Joykiller. Dexter Holland and Greg Kriesel of The Offspring were fans of T.S.O.L., and listened to Dance with Me obsessively when they were getting into punk rock. When The Offspring found major success in 1994, Holland and Kriesel founded their own record label, Nitro Records, re-releasing the T.S.O.L. and Weathered Statues EPs in 1997 as a single compilation. When the original T.S.O.L. lineup reunited in 1999, they signed to Nitro and released the albums Disappear (2001) and Divided We Stand (2003). In 2007 Nitro released a remastered version of Dance with Me with its original artwork.

Plot  In the early 1960s, Bobby Fontana (Lewis Smith), a young greaser-type rebel, challenges Joe Barnes (Mark Metcalf) to a game of chicken for making a pass at his girlfriend Emily (Jane Kaczmarek). Bobby wins the race easily when Joe dives out of his car, but Bobby is unable to get out of the car in time due to his bracelet getting caught on the gearshift. He dies as his car plummets over the cliff into a fiery wreck. Bobby awakens to find himself aboard a speeding train, which stops at a station housing a huge escalator going up into a bright white light, which one of the attendants refers to as \\"Uptown\\". Bobby is denied entry, and Rafferty (Richard Mulligan) appears and explains that he isn't considered ready yet and needs to carry out an assignment in order to earn his ticket Uptown. After many years in limbo, Bobby is finally given his assignment: he is to return to Earth and act as a guardian angel and friend for Lenny Barnes (Jason Gedrick), a promising high school student who is constantly picked on in school, particularly by school bullies Fred Gallo (Stephen Gregory) and Bill McIntyre (Beau Dremann). However, Bobby is instructed that he is only allowed to reveal himself to Lenny and nobody else. Bobby helps Lenny by giving him a makeover, assisting him in dealing with Fred and Bill, and helping him win the affection of the hottest girl in school, Sharon (Anne Sawyer). However, Bobby comes to realize that the new lifestyle Lenny is leading is not noble, as it causes him to rebel against everyone, including his parents and long-time friend Melissa (Nancy Valen). Bobby discovers that Lenny's mother is Emily, his former girlfriend, and is married to Joe, the man he was racing against when he died. Bobby breaks the Uptown rules and reveals himself to Emily to confess his love for her, and Emily informs him that he is actually Lenny's father. In a scene reminiscent of the opening sequence, Lenny is challenged to a chicken race at the local quarry by Fred, Sharon's former boyfriend. Having been told by Rafferty that Lenny will die just as Bobby did earlier, Bobby offers to trade his own chance to move Uptown (essentially, his own immortal soul) to save Lenny's life. Much like Bobby's car race, the race ends with Lenny and Bobby flying over the edge of a cliff, and the car exploding in a fiery wreck. However, Bobby prevents Lenny from dying, and they climb up the cliff together. Bobby helps Lenny see the error of his ways as Lenny reunites Melissa. After bidding an emotional goodbye to Lenny, during which he tells him that they will always be best friends, Bobby offers himself to Rafferty to fulfill his end of the bargain by accepting a ride \\"Downtown\\" (essentially, to Hell). However, Rafferty explains that this will not be happening. Bobby incredulously asks why, since he had made a deal to trade his own soul for Lenny's second chance at life. Rafferty explains to Bobby that he had learned to love and value someone more than himself, and that is how one earned a ticket Uptown. Bobby and Rafferty fly into the sky on a motorbike, and Bobby boards the escalator to Uptown.  Cast   Soundtrack  The soundtrack consists of ten songs featured in the movie.

It is often confused with congenital achromatopsiaBriefing from 2008 Achromatopsia Conference by James Fulton but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called color agnosia exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at. Signs and symptoms Patients with cerebral achromatopsia deny having any experience of color when asked and fail standard clinical assessments like the Farnsworth- Munsell 100-hue test (a test of color ordering with no naming requirements). Patients may often not notice their loss of color vision and merely describe the world they see as being \\"drab\\". Most describe seeing the world in \\"shades of gray\\". This observation notes a key difference between cerebral and congenital achromatopsia, as those born with achromatopsia have never had an experience of color or gray. Pathophysiology Cerebral achromatopsia differs from other forms of color blindness in subtle but important ways. It is a consequence of cortical damage that arises through ischemia or infarction of a specific area in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex of humans. This damage is almost always the result of injury or illness. Classification A 2005 study examined 92 case studies since 1970 in which cerebral lesions affected color vision. The severity and size of the visual field affected in cerebral achromatopsiacs vary from patient to patient. Bilateral and hemifield The majority of cases in the 2005 study were the result of bilateral lesions in the ventral occipital cortex. It is unknown whether this was the result of bilateral lesions being more likely to produce color-loss symptoms, or if it was a sampling effect of patients with more severe brain trauma more often being admitted for treatment. In many of the cases examined, patients reported only partial loss of color vision. The locations of color vision loss can be restricted to one hemisphere or one quarter of the visual field. The term \\"hemiachromatopsia\\" has been used to denote patients who experience loss of color in only one hemisphere of the visual field. However, as applied to achromatopia resulting from brain trauma, the term is incomplete in characterizing the often-complex nature of the vision loss. Transient In still rarer cases, temporary ischemia of the associated ventral occipital cortex can result in transient achromatopsia. The condition has thus far been characterized only in stroke patients and provides further support for a color processing area. In one case, a 78-year-old stroke victim had lost the ability to identify color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests. Even when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this achromatism to \\"poor lighting\\" and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the ventral occipital cortex. Co-occurrence with other deficits The most common disorder seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize or recall faces. In some studies, the comorbidity is seen as high as 72%. This significance has not been overlooked and is a subject of ongoing research. See below. Cerebral achromatopes often have poor spatial acuity. Diagnosis The most common tests perform to diagnose cerebral achromatopsia are the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test, the Ishihara plate test, and the color-naming test. Testing and diagnosis for cerebral achromatopsia is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor‚Äôs offices. Remarkably, almost 50% of tested patients diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia are able to perform normally on the color-naming test. However, these results are somewhat in question because of the sources from which many of these reports come. Only 29% of cerebral achromatopsia patients successfully pass the Ishihara plate test, which is a more accepted and more standardized test for color blindness. Difference from congenital achromatopsia The most apparent distinguishing characteristic between congenital achromatopsia and cerebral achromatopsia is the sudden onset of color vision loss following a severe head injury or damage to the occipital lobe following a stroke or similar ischemic event. Non-invasive imaging techniques can be the most helpful in determining whether the area of damage following a traumatic event is an correlated with color-vision processing. Simple diagnostic tools can also be used to determine whether a patient is a likely candidate for further testing, as advancing imaging procedures can often prove expensive and unnecessary. Co-morbid factors can be valuable indicators of the likelihood of cerebral achromatopsia. One disorder often seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recall or recognize faces. The correlation is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most telltale clue in this association is the close proximity of brain lesions seen in prosopagnosics and cerebral achromatopsiacs without prosopagnosia. Figure 1 illustrates overlap of brain lesions compiled from numerous case reports of both disorders. A common area of damage associated with both disorders can be seen in the right occipital lobe. Treatment No current treatment is known for the disorder. History The number of reported cases of cerebral achromatopsia are relatively few compared with other forms of color-vision loss. In addition, the severity of the color perception deficits along with other psychological effects vary between patients. Current research Based on the knowledge gained from cerebral achromatopsia case studies, current research is focusing on learning more about the cortical area involved in color processing. A recent study provided some of the first direct evidence of color-specific processing in the ventral occipital cortex. A subject with a history of seizure activity was examined using fMRI and electrode implantation. Using the fMRI, researchers examined the areas of blood oxygenation in the occipital lobe as the subject viewed various color-specific stimuli. The result of the experiment was the identification of an area in the subject, slightly anterior to the lesioned area in cerebral achromatic patients, that responded to variance in color stimulation. The resolution of the MRI was a limiting factor in identifying areas corresponding to specific colors. The next portion of the study used an electrode implanted in the right hemisphere in the location identified by the fMRI scan as pertaining to color processing. It was found the electrical activity of the area increased when the subject was presented with blue stimuli. The next, and most significant finding of the study, was that when the electrode was used to present an electrical stimulus in the subject‚Äôs brain, the subject reported the perception of the color blue. Such a result is consistent with other reports of electrical stimulation in visual field maps eliciting perception of phosphines in subjects‚Äô visual field. The color stimulus presented is not the only factor in determining the involvement of the ventral occipital cortex in color processing. The amount of attention and the type of object also affect the activation of the ventral occipital cortex. It has been noted that this area of the occipital lobe may not be a processing center but rather a pathway that is a critical intersection of several cortical areas involved in color perception. Society and culture The disorder is often presented as evidence of our incomplete knowledge of color processing. Color vision research is a well-studied field of modern neuroscience and the underlying anatomical processing in the retina have been well categorized. The presence of another factor in the perception of color by humans illustrates the need for more research. The case of the colorblind painter The most famous instance of cerebral achromatopsia is that of \\"Jonathan I.\\" immortalized in a case study by Oliver Sacks and Robert Wasserman, and published as \\"The Case of the Colorblind Painter\\".Sacks, Oliver. \\"The Case of the Colorblind Painter\\". An Anthropologist on Mars. New York: Random House, 1995. 3-41. The essay tracks Johnathan I.'s experience with cerebral achromatopsia from the point where an injury to his occipital lobe leaves him without the ability to perceive color, through his subsequent struggles to adapt to a black, white and gray world, and finally to his acceptance and even gratitude for his condition. Especially pertinent is the analysis of how cerebral achromatopsia affects his practice as a painter and artist. Descriptions of cerebral achromatopsia's effects on his psychological health and visual perception are especially striking. For instance, in recounting Mr. I.'s descriptions of flesh and foods, the authors write: See also *Achromatopsia *Cortical blindness *Color blindness *Ishihara color test  References  Category:Color Category:Vision Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa Category:Neuropsychology Category:Agnosia Category:Stroke ","title":"Cerebral achromatopsia"},{"id":"5813072","text":"Veerakkalpudur is a panchayat town in Salem district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

Based in Toronto, Ontario, Bloor has been performing and recording Knurl material since 1994, when his seminal harsh noise releases \\"Nervescrap\\" and \\"Initial Shock\\" were recorded and released. He has released over twenty albums internationally, and has collaborated with sound sculptors such as Jim O'Rourke, Thurston Moore, and Aube. Biography Bloor, originally from Windsor, Ontario, was involved in several bands in the early 80s, including a Hardcore punk band called \\"Binge of Violence.\\" After the band's breakup, he pursued a career as a solo musician, studying jazz bass, as well as classical and flamenco guitar. In the late 1980s he began performing noise backgrounds at poetry readings in Detroit, Michigan, in which he experimented with his bass guitar by placing metal objects on the strings to produce the sounds (a technique often called prepared guitar). Since that time, Bloor has delved heavily into experimentation with found objects as sound sources, which have included fan blades, typewriters, scrap metal and car springs. He has also supplied musical scores for performers Andrew Hammerson (ex DV-8) from the UK and Jake Brown, Montreal. Since the beginning of 1995 he has been performing solo as Knurl in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Detroit, and has explored a less harsh side of noise music in his acclaimed ambient music project called Pholde. Music Knurl's objective is to take music and strip it entirely of what we know music to be: it's rhythm, melody, vocals, even production quality which is most associated with music today. Bloor records and performs without the assistance of computers, synthesizers or samplers.

The National Socialist regime and its anti-Semitism forced her to leave Germany in 1937 and to emigrate to Sweden. In Sweden, she continued to work as a portraitist and painter of landscapes until her death. The art works she created during the 1920s and 1930s in the context of New Objectivity in Germany constitute the highpoint of her career. Life and work Laserstein was born in Preussisch Holland, German Empire in 1898. Her father Hugo was a pharmacist and her mother Meta was a pianist, piano teacher and a porcelain painter.Stroude, Caroline, and Adrian Stroude. ‚ÄúLotte Laserstein and the German Naturalist Tradition.‚Äù Woman's Art Journal, vol. 9, no. 1, 1988, pp. 35‚Äì38., www.jstor.org/stable/1358361. Christened as a child, she grew up in an assimilated German-Jewish household. She received her artistic training at the Prussian Academy of Arts (Preu√üische Akademie der K√ºnste), which she entered only a couple of years after its admission of female students. Here, Laserstein studied under Erich Wolfsfeld. In her final two years at the academy she advanced to one of his 'Atelier Meistersch√ºler' or 'star pupil'. This entitled her to her own studio as well as free access to models. The paintings she produced between her graduation in 1927 and 1933 in Berlin are considered to be her best works which were shown in 20 exhibits in the city's galleries and museums. Laserstein who favored female models and the representation of female lifeworlds blended \\"social representation with painterly presence\\". While her entire oeuvre encompasses approximately 10.000 works, 300 paintings and 100 drawings are verified for her Berlin years. After her emigration to Sweden, she took on mostly commissioned portrait works. Her attempts to save the lives of her mother Meta and her sister K√§te from Nazi persecution by bringing them to Sweden were in vain. Her mother was murdered in 1943 in the concentration camp Ravensbr√ºck, and her sister survived deeply traumatized in hiding and died in 1965. Berlin in the 1920s was a center of cultural production as well as political and economic struggle. Laserstein painted cadavers to illustrate text books to obtain cash during the period of hyperinflation. During this time women were growing in independence and were increasingly entering the workplace. Laserstein depicted contemporary women of many stripes and fashions, including New Woman types, who adopted a more masculine look, and female nudes. As a single professional woman, Laserstein herself embodied the New Woman, and her androgynous look is evident in her many self-portraits, for example, Self-portrait with A Cat (1928) at the Leicester Museum and Art Gallery.Lotte Lasserstein at Leicester's German Expressionist Collection. Retrieved 17 March 2017 Her most famous paintings, for example Die Tennisspielerin (The Tennis Player, 1929), contributed to the verism of New Objectivity movement but also showed continuity with German Naturalism. Laserstein's masterpiece was the large (about 7‚Äì 8 feet wide) 1930 painting Abend √ºber Potsdam (Evening over Potsdam), a frieze of friends sharing a meal on their terrace, with Potsdam's skyline arrayed in the far distance. The painting was so large that it needed the co-operation of friends to transport it. The elegiac scene references Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper and Jan Vermeer von Delft's Milkmaid in order to convey the particular affect, temporality and political stalemate of 1930. During the Nazi period in Germany, Laserstein emigrated to Sweden, where she stayed in Stockholm and the city of Kalmar. She died in Kalmar on January 21, 1993. Legacy Laserstein was rediscovered in 1987, when Thomas Agnew & Sons and the Belgrave Gallery organized a joint exhibition and sale of works she had retained in her personal collection, including Abend √ºber Potsdam, now in the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin.Women Artists Slide Library Journal 22 (April‚ÄìMay 1988). Retrieved 5 November 2014 Laserstein attended the exhibition together with her close friend and model of many decades, Traute (Gertrud) Rose. Her painting Traute washing was the first purchase by the National Museum of Women in the Arts with its own funds.\\"Women's Museum Makes Its First Purchase,\\" Washington Post, January 27, 1988, D 1, 11.

Players assume the role of a skeet shooter shooting clay pigeons. There is a two-player mode where the players alternate. Skeet Shoot was developed by programmer Ed Salvo in his Iowa home and purchased by Pat Roper under the newly formed Apollo. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success and led to Salvo's continuation with the company, where he became Director of Development. Gameplay Gameplay; the shooter is seen at the bottom. The player controls a skeet shooter who is shooting clay pigeons. By pressing the button on the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle. A point is earned if the bullet hits. Difficulty varieties adjust the speed of the pigeons. Two two- player gameplay variations exist and are activated by modifying the Atari 2600's difficulty switches. There is an alternating version where players take turns shooting the clay pigeons, and another variation features one player shooting while the other controls the angle of the clay pigeons. Other variables that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from. Development Ed Salvo developed Skeet Shoot independently. Salvo had self-taught himself to program for the Atari 2600 after purchasing an Atari 800; the dealer wanted a flight simulator for the 2600 so he contracted Salvo to make one. The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest. According to Salvo, the development of Skeet Shoot took him around a month at night in his home to finish. After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio Games by Apollo that asked for programmers, he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him Skeet Shoot. Roper decided that Skeet Shoot was a good enough game for a first time. He offered Salvo a job at Apollo, which Salvo declined, believing it would be too risky. When Salvo returned to his Iowa home, Roper contacted him and told him he would buy Skeet Shoot for five thousand dollars which Salvo accepted. Skeet Shoot still had glitches when it was released; one caused the image to flip vertically. Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it, and the only cartridges that bear the bug are European versions. Reception Reviews were negative, as Apollo's publicist Emmit Crawford acknowledged. Crawford believed that the reason people did not like Skeet Shoot was because it did not provide enough challenge for most video game players and that the company had distributed it in too much of a hurry. He later said that \\"All in all, Skeet Shoot wasn't a spectacular game to start off with.\\" Despite the poor publicity, the game sold very well. Author Brett Alan Weiss wrote that Skeet Shoot was \\"a shoddily programmed, graphically primitive game\\" and said that the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game \\"virtually worthless\\". A writer for Atari HQ called it a mediocre game. Lee Peppas of ANALOG Computing remarked that \\"Atari & Activision have nothing to fear from the graphics on this first release.\\" TV Gamer opined it was one of the worst games for the system, saying that it was boring and criticizing the fact that it was difficult to hit the skeet. Mark Androvich of Classic Gamer Magazine was similarly negative, writing \\"Games by Apollo released a couple of decent games before going bankrupt, but you never would have guessed that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game.\\" Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not \\"a step in the right direction\\" for Apollo. Aftermath After Skeet Shoot, Salvo signed a contract that led to the creation of Spacechase. Eventually, Salvo became Apollo's Director of Development and was given the job of hiring 25 programmers to work on Apollo's games. Apollo went on to release seven other games after Skeet Shoot. One year later, the studio eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 12, 1982, due to pressure from its advertising agency, Benton & Bowles. Apollo owed the company $2.5 million (half of its total debt). Although Roper expected Apollo to return in \\"smaller form\\", the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed.

The film stars Kevin Kline as Nick Starkey, a smart ex-NYPD detective who is lured back into service by his police commissioner brother (Harvey Keitel) when a serial killer terrorizes the city. Nick becomes involved with the mayor's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and is aided in his investigation by his neighbor, Ed, an artist (Alan Rickman). Plot On New Year's Eve, Manhattan socialite Alison Hawkins returns home from the evening's festivities. As she feeds her fish before going to bed, she is strangled to death by an undetected intruder with a blue ribbon. It is the latest murder by a serial killer who has been terrorizing the city for eleven months. The mayor, frustrated with the lack of progress in the case, and tells NYPD commissioner Frank Starkey to bring in his brother, former detective Nick Starkey, being the only man brilliant enough to catch the killer. This is a controversial assignment for Frank because Nick left the force in disgrace two year earlier. Frank talks Nick into returning, but only on the condition that he be able to cook dinner the next night for Frank's wife, Christine, who is Nick's ex-girlfriend. After a press conference announcing Nick's reinstatement, Christine and Nick have dinner. Old wounds are opened, including mention of a canceled check which indicated that Frank was involved in the scandal that got Nick fired. After reporting for work, Nick takes a different office than the one he was assigned because the light was not to the liking of his friend Ed, a painter. After getting Alcoa to add Ed to the payroll as his assistant, Nick begins work on the case. His first lead is to speak to the mayor's daughter, Bernadette, who was a friend of Alison. After Nick and Bernadette visit Alison's apartment, he decides to let her stay at his apartment because she is too frightened to return to her own. Nick realizes that the previous murders occurred on dates that are prime numbers, all of which are among the twelve prime numbers possible up to the number 31. Because 5 is the only one of the prime numbers that has not been used, Nick deduces that the next murder will take place the following night, on the fifth of the month. However, Nick is seemingly proven wrong when a woman is strangled one day ahead of Nick's prediction, after which the killer leaps out the window to his death. Nick believes that this is a copycat killing, especially when he learns that the man broke a window, as opposed to picking a lock to gain entrance as in the other murders. Frank and the mayor consider the case closed are content to be done with Nick. Nick and Ed figure out that the position of the victims' buildings, when seen on a map of Manhattan, forms the constellation Virgo. They also realize that all the rooms in which the murders took place have windows on the front of the building, and that when the exterior positions of the windows are lined up together according to which floor they are on, they correlate to eleven notes in the chorus of the song \\"Calendar Girl\\". This enables them to identify where the killer will next strike. Nick sets a trap with Bernadette as bait, outfitting her with a neck guard to prevent the killer from strangling her. The trio stake out the room in a supply closet and witness the killer picking the lock to get into the apartment. They intercept the apartment's resident and send Bernadette in, where she is attacked. Nick breaks in and, after a prolonged struggle with the killer, subdues him. He then wraps him up in the hall carpet and delivers him to the police outside the building. Cast * Kevin Kline as Lt.

Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \\"one of the worst movies of all time,\\" writing: \\"The January Man is worth study as a film that fails to find its tone. It's all over the map. It wants to be zany but violent, satirical but slapstick, romantic but cynical. It wants some of its actors to rant and rave like amateur tragedians, and others to reach for subtle nuances. And it wants all of these things to happen at the same time.\\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post was even more harsh, writing, \\"Eliot called April the cruelest month, but then he hadn't seen The January Man. Billed as a mystery with romance and comedy, it is a damp sock of a movie that makes you wish for a leap year\\". The film's box-office gross (in the USA) was $4,611,062. It holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 16 reviews.

In animal cells, CAK phosphorylates the Cdk subunit only after cyclin binding, and so the two steps in Cdk activation are usually ordered as shown here, with cyclin binding occurring first. Budding yeast contains a different version of CAK that can phosphorylate the Cdk even in the absence of cyclin, and so the two activation steps can occur in either order. In all cases, CAK tends to be in constant excess in the cell, so that cyclin binding is the rate-limiting step in Cdk activation. CDK-activating kinase (CAK) activates the cyclin-CDK complex by phosphorylating threonine residue 160 in the CDK activation loop. CAK itself is a member of the Cdk family and functions as a positive regulator of Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6.  Catalytic activity  Cdk activation requires two steps. First, cyclin must bind to the Cdk. In the second step, CAK must phosphorylate the cyclin-Cdk complex on the threonine residue 160, which is located in the Cdk activation segment. Since Cdks need to be free of Cdk inhibitor proteins (CKIs) and associated with cyclins in order to be activated, CAK activity is considered to be indirectly regulated by cyclins. Phosphorylation is generally considered a reversible modification used to change enzyme activity in different conditions. However, activating phosphorylation of Cdk by CAK appears to be an exception to this trend. In fact, CAK activity remains high throughout the cell cycle and is not regulated by any known cell-cycle control mechanism. However compared to normal cells, CAK activity is reduced in quiescent G0 cells and slightly elevated in tumor cells. In mammals, activating phosphorylation by CAK can only occur once cyclin is bound. In budding yeast, activating phosphorylation by CAK can take place before cyclin binding. In both humans and yeast, cyclin binding is the rate limiting step in the activation of Cdk. Therefore, phosphorylation of Cdk by CAK is considered a post-translational modification that is necessary for enzyme activity. Although activating phosphorylation by CAK is not exploited for cell-cycle regulation purposes, it is a highly conserved process because CAK also regulates transcription.  Orthologs  In animals (for example, H. sapiens, left), a trimeric CAK enzyme containing Cdk7 functions both in the activation of Cdks and in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (right) the homologous enzyme, Kin28, does not contribute to Cdk activation but is focused entirely on control of transcription. In this species, an unrelated protein kinase, Cak1, activates Cdks. The fission yeast S. pombe (center) occupies an intermediate position, in which Cdk activation can be achieved both by the Cdk7 homolog Mcs6 and by a Cak1 homolog, Csk1. Cdk7, Kin28 and Mcs6 are all Cdks whose activities are also enhanced by phosphorylation of residues in their T-loops. In budding and fission yeasts, this phosphorylation is carried out by Cak1 and Csk1, respectively. The kinase that phosphorylates Cdk7 in animals is not clear. CAK varies dramatically in different species. In vertebrates and Drosophilia, CAK is a trimeric protein complex consisting of Cdk7 (a Cdk-related protein kinase), cyclinH, and Mat1. The Cdk7 subunit is responsible for Cdk activation while the Mat1 subunit is responsible for transcription. The CAK trimer can be phosphorylated on the activation segment of Cdk7 subunit. However, unlike other Cdks, this phosphorylation is might not be essential for CAK activity. In the presence of Mat1, activation of CAK does not require phosphorylation of the activation segment. However, in the absence of Mat1, phosphorylation of the activation segment is required for CAK activity. In vertebrates, CAK localizes to the nucleus. This suggests that CAK is not only involved in cell- cycle regulation but is also involved in transcription. In fact, the Cdk7 subunit of vertebrate CAK phosphorylates several components of the transcriptional machinery. In budding yeast, CAK is a monomeric protein kinase and is referred to as Cak1. Cak1 is distantly homologous to Cdks. Cak1 localizes to the cytoplasm and is responsible for Cdk activation. Budding yeast Cdk7 homolog, Kin28, does not have CAK activity. Fission yeasts have two CAKs with both overlapping and specialized functions. The first CAK is a complex of Msc6 and Msc2. The Msc6 and Msc2 complex is related to the vertebrate Cdk7-cyclinH complex. Msc6 and Msc2 complex not only activates cell cycle Cdks but also regulates gene expression because it is part of the transcription factor TFIIH. The second fission yeast CAK, Csk1, is an ortholog of budding yeast Cak1. Csk1 can activate Cdks but is not essential for Cdk activity.

The active site of Cdk2 lies in a cleft between the two lobes of the kinase. ATP binds deep within the cleft and its phosphate is oriented outwards. Protein substrates bind to the entrance of the active site cleft. In its inactive form, Cdk2 cannot bind substrate because the entrance of its active site is blocked by the T-loop. Inactive Cdk2 also has a misoriented ATP binding site. When Cdk2 is inactive, the small L12 helix pushes the large PSTAIRE helix outwards. The PSTAIRE helix contains a residue, glutamate 51, that is important for positioning the ATP phosphates. When cyclinA binds, several conformational changes take place. The T-loop moves out of active site entrance and no longer blocks the substrate binding site. The PSTAIRE helix moves in. The L12 helix becomes a beta strand. This allows glutamate 51 to interact with lysine 33. Aspartate 145 also changes position. Together these structural changes allow ATP phosphates to bind correctly. When CAK phosphorylates Cdk's threonine residue160, the T-loop flattens and interacts more closely with cyclin A. Phosphorylation also allows the Cdk to interact more effectively with substrates that contain the SPXK sequence. Phosphorylation also increases the activity of cyclinA-Cdk2 complex. Different cyclins produce different conformation changes in Cdk.

Two forms of CAK have been identified: free CAK and TFIIH-associated CAK. Free CAK is more abundant than TFIIH-associated CAK. Free CAK phosphorylates Cdks and is involved in cell cycle regulation. Associated CAK is part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. CAK associated with TFIIH phosphorylates proteins involved in transcription including RNA polymerase II. More specifically, associated CAK is involved in promoter clearance and progression of transcription from the preinitiation to the initiation stage. In vertebrates, the trimeric CAK complex is responsible for transcription regulation. In budding yeast, the Cdk7 homolog, Kin28, regulates transcription. In fission yeast, the Msc6 Msc2 complex controls basal gene transcription. In addition to regulating transcription, CAK also enhances transcription by phosphorylating retinoic acid and estrogen receptors. Phosphorylation of these receptors leads to increased expression of target genes. In leukemic cells, where DNA is damaged, CAK‚Äôs ability to phosphorylate retinoic acid and estrogen receptors is decreased. Decreased CAK activity creates a feedback loop, which turns off TFIIH activity. CAK also plays a role in DNA damage response. The activity of CAK associated with TFIIH decreases when DNA is damaged by UV irradiation. Inhibition of CAK prevents cell cycle from progressing. This mechanism ensures the fidelity of chromosome transmission.

Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling. Cycling is a discretionary full blue sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the Varsity Match against Cambridge, as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.  History  Early years The history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as Oxford Blue) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \\"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\\". Those local aims were soon to have national application as the club became centrally involved in forming and shaping the bodies that would organize competitive and recreational cycling in England and Wales in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. It was one of the eight clubs that met in Westminster on 7 September 1875 to establish an Amateur Championship. Founder members of the D.B.B.C. included the three who would represent Oxford in the first cycling Varsity match, which was held in 1874: Edgar Wing (Worcester Coll.), Charles Penrose (Oriel Coll.), and Charles F. Read (Queen‚Äôs Coll.) and, according to his own recollection, Edmund Denniss (Hertford Coll.).Anon. (1915) Representative British Freemasons. A Series of Biographies and Portraits of Early Twentieth Century Freemasons, London: Dod's Peeerage, pp.150-52. Rivalry between the two university clubs soon extended to the Hour Record, being first set and then bettered by their riders three times between 1876 and 1879, the two latter by Dark Blues, Weir and Christie. In May 1881, the club changed its name to the Oxford University Bicycle Club, abbreviated to O.U.Bi.C.; the \\"i\\" distinguishing it from the Oxford University Boat Club. In Lent Term, 1882, the membership of the club stood at 44.Rules, Bye-Laws, Report and List of Members, Oxford: Oxford University Bicycle Club, 1882. The club continued as O.U.Bi.C. until it fell dormant in 1903. Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885 (not held) and 1895 (abandoned), while over that period the format of the competition had varied considerably, from a road race between the two university towns to a track race meet. Modern era OUCC rider Danny Axford on his way to a 4th BUSA Hillclimb victory, at Curbar Gap, Derbyshire In early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: ‚ÄúAfter an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\\".Liverpool Daily Post, Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12. it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29 January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of World War II, mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. During the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \\"3-up\\" team time trial on a \\"neutral\\" course near Whipsnade. Cambridge \\"rode over\\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure. The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall), while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of Rilke,Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of Oxford Today, 13 December 1997, in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', Oxford Today 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997). was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. After another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. It has enjoyed continuous unbroken existence ever since. The club was affiliated (for road racing) to the British League of Racing Cyclists and (for time trials) to the Road Time Trials Council. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was Anne Sims (St. Anne‚Äôs Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co- existing happily with the racing imperative, and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957‚Äì58. Following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held on the H23 course (Kidlington) on 5 June 1958; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists. Their President was official timekeeper for the early Varsity matches when the OUCC took its turn to organise the event. In its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under Cycling Time Trials (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. In the 1960s and 1970s, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed ‚Äòclub‚Äô cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college ‚ÄòCuppers‚Äô 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only Roy Cromack, then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to- late ‚Äò60s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. ‚Äòall-rounder‚Äô, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance, was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. In the early-to-mid 1970s, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970s, the racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in ‚Äú3-up‚Äù and ‚Äú4-up‚Äù time- trial ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London, whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.\\"Varsity Verve\\", Oxford Mail, 12 May 1982. In the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980s by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \\"Gene\\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by Dick Poole, the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980s. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former Giro d'Italia rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of cycling for sheer enjoyment. While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the Scholar Gypsy affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery. The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. Inter-university achievements In 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining BUCS / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S. Newington, D. Hulmes, S. Cryer: team Hill-Climb) and 1996 (Brenda Allen: Women's 10-miles T.T., 25-miles T.T., and Hill-Climb; Jim Henderson: Hill- Climb) and 1997 (Digby Symons: Best All-Rounder over 10/25/50/100-mile T.T. distances; Brenda Allen: Women's 100-miles T.T.; Jim Henderson, 50-miles T.T.). Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998. 2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the Cyclo-cross race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships. In 2015, Olivia Withers (L.M.H.), Imogen Kempton (Lincoln Coll.), and Tamara Davenne (Merton Coll.), of the newly formed women's racing squad, won the BUCS \\"3-up\\" team time trial, with Devenne also winning the BUCS circuit road race.

It is located south of Callaghan Lake and west of the resort town of Whistler. With a summit elevation of and a topographic prominence of , it rises above the surrounding rugged landscape on an alpine mountain ridge. This mountain ridge represents the base of a north- south trending volcanic field which Mount Fee occupies. The mountain consists of a narrow north-south trending ridge of fine-grained volcanic rock and small amounts of fragmental material. It is long and wide with nearly vertical flanks. Mount Fee has two main summits, the southern tower of which is the highest. The summits are separated by a U-shaped crevice that gives them a prominent appearance. Geology Mount Fee is one of the southernmost volcanoes in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. This volcanic zone forms the central portion of the larger Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, which extends from the Silverthrone Caldera in the north to the Watts Point volcano in the south. The volcanic belt has formed as a result of ongoing subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone along the British Columbia Coast. This is a north-south trending fault zone about long, extending off the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone. The edifice of Mount Fee is the remains of a volcanic feature that has been significantly eroded by glacial ice. It likely represents a dissected stratovolcano (also known as a composite volcano) that was larger in area and higher in elevation than its current form. Stratovolcanoes can reach heights of and consist of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks and bombs. During the glacial periods, much of the volcano's original outer cone of pyroclastic material was eroded away by moving layers of ice and rock. The removal of the ejected volcanic material has exposed the dacite lava that forms the narrow north- south trending ridge of Mount Fee. The Black Tusk, a pinnacle of dark volcanic rock to the southeast, is also interpreted to be the remains of a deeply eroded volcano that was once covered with pyroclastic material. The present day edifice of Mount Fee contains several lava spines that reach heights of to above the main ridge. Eruptive history Volcanic activity at Mount Fee is among the oldest in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanic rocks remain undated, but the large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. As a result, the rocks comprising Mount Fee do not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice; the duration of volcanic events is unknown, and the exact timing of eruptive events is unknown. However, a large variety of volcanoes formed subglacially between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago in the vicinity of Mount Fee, including the lava domes of Ember Ridge to the south. Mount Fee rising above adjacent mountainous terrain. This view of the mountain is from the south. At least three phases of eruptive activity have been recognized at Mount Fee. The only exposed remnant of Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor outcrop of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive eruptions during Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of volcanic rocks on Fee's eastern flank. This volcanic material was likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of the ancestral Mount Fee. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lavas on its northern flank. The U-shaped crevice separating the two main summits of Mount Fee separates this lava flow from the main volcanic ridge. The conduit from which these lava flows originated was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older rocks deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north- south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark. Petrography The dacite and rhyodacite rocks comprising Mount Fee contain up to 70% brown volcanic glass and up to 15% vesicles. About 25% of the rocks contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates that it might have developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion. Human history Habitation The prominent spine of Mount Fee rising above the lightly glaciated northern subglacial dome of Ember Ridge. Human habitation at Mount Fee extends from hundreds to thousands of years ago. Glassy volcanic rocks, such as rhyodacite, were widely used to make knives, chisels, adzes and other sharp tools before the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century. It was collected from a number of minor outcrops on the flanks of Mount Fee, as well as at the Mount Cayley massif and Mount Callaghan. This material appears in goat hunting sites and at the Elaho rockshelter, collectively dated from about 100 to 8,000 years ago. In September 1928, Mount Fee was named by British mountaineer Tom Fyles after Charles Fee (1865‚Äì1927), who was a member of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club in Vancouver at the time. Subsequently, Mount Fee was one of the volcanoes in the Mount Cayley volcanic field illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980. Others included the Mount Cayley massif, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. Souther created a geologic map the following year that displayed the locations of the volcanoes and the regional terrain. Monitoring Like other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Belt, Mount Fee is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma chamber is. This is partly because no major eruptions have taken place in Canada for over a hundred years and the volcano is located in a remote region. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, such as tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. No recent earthquakes are known to have occurred at Mount Fee. If it were to erupt there would likely be weeks, months or years of warning signs, such as clusters of minor earthquakes that would likely originate less than below the surface. They are generally too small to be felt by people, but the existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes. However, the seismograph network is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a significant eruption. It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. A significant eruption at Mount Fee would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists has resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of the Garibaldi volcanoes. Climate Mount Fee in spring Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mt. Fee is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Fee.

Vallalar at Vettavalam Palace Vettavalam Palace Vallalar Real Picture drawn at Vettavalam Zamin VallalarVallalar at Vettavalam cured cases of spirit-possession. One of the two wives of the Zamindar of Vettavalam was possessed by a \\"brahma Rakshasi\\" an evil female spirit. The other suffered from the disease of dropsy. In spite of several treatments by medicine, by occultism and magic and by offering of animals in sacrifice, their sufferings could not be relieved. At the request of the Zamindar, Vallalar went to Vettavalam. The Zamindar had provided two identical chairs for Vallalar to sit on. As soon as Vallalar reached the house and was about to step into it, the spirit -possessed wife came out and joined her hands in prayer to Vallalar and assured him that she (the female spirit) was waiting to leave the affected person (i.e. Zamindar 's wife) at Vallalar's bidding. She received sacred ash from Vallalar. The spirit departed leaving Zamindar 's wife to enjoy the freedom of her life. Then, Vallalar gave sacred ash in three small quantities to the other wife of the Zamindar and cured her from dropsy. Vallalar sat in the very particular chair which the Zamindar had chosen for him, this was a test to see if Vallalar was a yogi or not. However the Zamindar asked for Vallalar's pardon for such a behaviour in his thought. He converted the whole family as vegetarians, stopped sacrifice of animals at the \\"Kali\\" temple of that village and instead asked the people to offer milk- rice (i.e., rice cooked in milk) to the goddess. All the poisonous creatures such as snakes were asked to be removed to a distant forest outside the village, instead of killing them or doing any harm to them. For this purpose a snake-charmer was engaged at the request of Vallalar.

Malaiammal was born in a Zamindar family in Vettavalam, a district near Thiruvannamalai. When Malaiammal was young, she was affected severely by smallpox. The zamindar brought Malaiammal to the temple and left her at its entrance and went away. On hearing the cries of the little girl, the Amman blessed the girl and cured her from the disease. Malaiammal had spent her entire life in the temple, cleaning the shrine and meditating before the Amman. Muthu Mariamman blessed and glorified Malaiammal. Malaiammal gave ‚ÄòArul Vaakku‚Äô(prediction the future) to the devotees who came there with sufferings and worries and her Vaakku became true. Many devotees came from different places to worship Muthu Mariamman and to get ‚ÄòArul Vaakku‚Äô from Malaiammal. Malaiammal extended the temple premises. Soon, Narthamalai became a famous temple.

The Monomachine was available as SFX-60 model, which is a desktop sound module, and was available as the SFX-6 model, which has a keyboard and a joystick controller. During the last quarter of 2007 Elektron released the SFX-60 MkII, which is a revision providing higher signal-to-noise ratio, a slimmer design and the ability to add user waveforms, introduced with OS 1.20 in July 2008. The Monomachine's major difference in comparison to other synthesizers is its sonic flexibility. The unit offers five synthesis methods: SID, VO, FM+, SuperWave, and DigiPro. It also offers multiple effects, which can be applied both to the internally generated voices and to external sources using the two audio inputs. The sequencer offers six tracksOffers six internal tracks and six external tracks for controlling other MIDI equipment programmable either in real time or via a step input method similar to classic drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 or classic sequenced synths like the Roland TB-303 or Roland MC-202. A key feature of the sequencer is what Elektron refer to as a \\"parameter lock\\", whereby each sequencer step can be associated with a snapshot of all the editable parameters for a sound. Signals can be routed externally to three stereo or six mono outputs.  Design  According to its designers, the Monomachine is designed to be a creative synthesizer and is not following the specs race as is common for today's synthesizers. The user manual states: > Synthesizers are available in many different types and forms. Nevertheless, > for most part they follow the norm how a synthesizer of its era is expected > to be. Development for musical tools generally comes in the form of new > synthesis techniques or an increase in polyphony, memory or other > quantitative elements. The advances in the music machine world have brought > numerous good inventions for musicians. However, we believe usability is > easily lost in the hunt for the highest specifications. With the Monomachine > we have tried creating a synthesizer free from prejudice, and focus on what > actually spurs creativity without letting technology stand in your way. We > want to inspire you to make sounds and music you haven‚Äôt even thought of.  SID  The SID emulation method is based on the sound processor from the Commodore 64 home computer (Elektron formerly offered a separate product known as the SidStation, each unit of which was built around a SID chip. However, the company has now ceased production, indicating that chips are no longer available). The parameters available in the Monomachine are considerably more limited than those in the SidStation, employing an interface editable in more conventional terms than the SID's wavetable approach. Saw, triangle, pulse, mixed and noise waveforms are available, and the sounds produced tend to be sharp-edged and gritty in character.  VO  The VO engine is a voice synthesizer similar in sound to the Speak & Spell of the 1980s.  FM+  FM+ sounds similar to the Yamaha DX series synthesizers, which use frequency modulation to construct sound.  SuperWave  SuperWave is a synth engine. Elektron states it is \\"based on the analog world of synthesizers.\\"  DigiPro  DigiPro is a machine that offers raw, 12-bit digital waveforms. DigiPro- Wave offers 32 waveforms, with interpolation between adjacent waveforms. DigiPro Beat Box is a drum machine, featuring 24 12-bit percussion samples. DigiPro Doubledraw allows the user to create an oscillator by blending two different waveforms. DigiPro Ensemble resembles the SuperWave Ensemble machine, but is built for use with the fixed DigiPro waveforms or those loaded by the user.

Since 2007 the site, now known as Zion's Camp, has been owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  Camp Onway history  The name \\"Onway\\" came from the latter part of the name of the great Bashaba (ruling chief) who led the nation of many tribes of Native Americans that ruled this area: Passaconaway. Camp Onway consisted of nine campsites: Abnaki, Algonquin (Provo), Jacunda, New Magee, Old Magee, Pedhela, and Travers. The other two campsites, Gillwell Fields and Nawachapo, were being used by Scoutcraft and the Woodsman program. The \\"hill\\" consisted of six cabins that housed the junior staff and the \\"Hill Patrol\\". The senior staff were housed in four cabins: the Screenhouse, the Lawrence Cabin, the Andovers Cabin, and the Methuen Cabin. The director and program director were in Cabin 13, also known as the Director's cabin. This land has been used as a camping place since 1900. The first camp was a county YMCA camp for boys. The YMCA used the Pine Grove, located at approximately the center of the waterfront property. For five to ten years the YMCA shared this land for one month with the Girls Work Community Council of Exeter. They operated together until 1924, at which time the county YMCA purchased a camp site in Kingston. The Girls Work Community Council operated the land until 1929. In 1929, the North Essex Council consisting of Lawrence, Methuen, Andover, and North Andover purchased the land for $4,400. A mortgage of $2,700 was held by Burchard E. Horne who, through his contribution, liquidated the entire amount. The mortgage was burned at the tenth anniversary of Camp Onway, July 21, 1940. The dining hall was named for Horne, in recognition of his interest in Scouting. When the camp opened in 1930, there were two troop campsites. The first was Abnacki, which came from the Native American Abenaki tribe who were ruled by Passaconaway. The second was Pedhela, whose name was taken from the two presidents of North Essex Council, William Peddler and James Hennessey, and from the chairman of the Camping Committee, Stanley Lane: PEDdler + HEnnessy + LAne = PEDHELA. In 1930, the St. James cabin was built. It is the oldest standing building in camp today. As the camp grew, so did the facilities. Between 1940 and 1945, the cabin just uphill from the dining hall (cabin 7) and the George Wilson Lodge (before 1998 this was the Health Lodge) were built. A new road was added to make travel in and out of camp easier. In 1964, the Camp Ranger's house burned down and was rebuilt along with a new maintenance building. In the years to follow, more additions were made such as the shower facilities, rifle and archery ranges, the Catholic chapel, and the Charrette Activity Center and Takesian Memorials. The kitchen was rebuilt and the dining hall was modernized in 1971 after fire struck again. Other additions include the staff cabins, the expansion of the waterfront area, an increase in the conservation practices, including multi-land use, and a Wood Badge/Leadership Development area. In 1989, Onway's 60th anniversary, Camp Onway and North Essex Council welcomed the North Bay Council in the first year of a shared camping venture between the two councils. In the following years improvements were made to the campsite latrines, the Trail Center was converted to become the new Commissary/Trading Post, and renovations were made to the central shower house and Magee Lodge. In 1992, thanks to a $20,000 gift from the George W. Magee Trust Fund, a floating swimming dock system was added to the waterfront. On January 1, 1993, North Essex Council, North Bay Council, and Lone Tree Council merged to form the new Yankee Clipper Council. A joint camp use committee decided to concentrate the council's summer Boy Scout program at Camp Onway and move all Cub and Webelos programs to Lone Tree Scout Reservation. The Friends of Onway contributed $70,000 to expand and renovate the dining hall to a first-class facility in 1994. Additional improvements included construction of a parking lot, a redesigning of the rifle range, and renovations to the newly dedicated Rheaume Nature Lodge. A new latrine was added to the waterfront and another was built in 1996 at the rifle range. 1997 saw the construction of a new storage shed for the Archery Range as well as a weather shelter. In 1998 a new health lodge was constructed and later named the Robert Mundry Health Lodge at the June 2000 council annual meeting. Also in 1998 the waterfront lookout tower was rebuilt, and a new walk-in freezer was added to the kitchen. The summer of 2007 marked the last at Camp Onway before it was sold to the LDS Church.  Sale  In 2005 the Properties Study Committee started reviewing all council camp properties to determine the best use of assets for the sustainability of the scouting program in the council's service area as part of the long-term strategic planning process. A recommendation to sell the Camp Onway property was eventually forwarded to the Yankee Clipper Council executive board. The sale was met with a large amount of opposition from Scouts, Scouters and staff members. Numerous arguments were presented to reject the sale. A petition was signed by over 1,000 Scouts, Scouters, and friends of Scouting. Many of the articles are available at SaveCampOnway.com. At a meeting on March 22, the Yankee Clipper Council (YCC) executive board voted 26-10 in favor of selling Camp Onway. The sale, originally set to take place in late August, was delayed due to controversy surrounding the original deed from 1929. After a drawn-out legal debate as to whether the YCC had the right to sell the camp, it was decided that they did. More than seven months after the initial vote, the YCC was contacted by the LDS Church, saying that because of the declining property market, they must lower the price of $2.8 million to $2.45 million. The YCC immediately had a vote to push the sale through. On November 30, 2007, Camp Onway was sold to the LDS Church for $2.45 million, which the YCC put into an endowment fund. The new owners have since changed the name to \\"Zion's Camp\\". Building projects 1929 *Burchard E.

Population: History First attested in 1137, Velsk regularly suffered from inundations before it was moved to a higher spot in the 16th century. It was known as a pogost before 1555, as a posad between 1555 and 1780, whereupon it was incorporated as a town of Vologda Viceroyalty. Velsk developed as a merchant town, having profited from its location on the Vaga and late on the road connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk (which in the 17th century was the only major trade harbor in European Russia). Trade fairs were held in Velsk; the most important one was the St. Athanasius Trade Fair. In 1796, Velsky Uyezd was transferred to Vologda Governorate and remained there until 1929, when several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished and Velsk became the administrative center of Velsky District, a part of Nyandoma Okrug of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai was transformed into Northern Oblast and in 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Velsk serves as the administrative center of Velsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with the railway station of Vaga, incorporated within Velsky District as the town of district significance of Velsk. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Velsk, together with two rural localities in Ust-Velsky Selsoviet of Velsky District, are incorporated within Velsky Municipal District as Velskoye Urban Settlement.Law #258-vneoch.-OZ Economy Industry Town's economy is dominated by timber industry. Vaga was used for timber rafting until the 1990s. Food production is also present. Transportation Velsk is located on the M8 Highway‚Äîone of the principal highways in Russia connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The secondary roads lead east to Oktyabrsky and west to Konosha, branching off in Velsk. Velsk has a railway station (since 1942) on the railroad connecting Konosha and Kotlas, which eventually continues to Vorkuta. The Velsk Airport provided passenger service until the 1990s, but has not been used since. In 2011, after a long break, a helicopter was tanked in Velsk. There are plans to use it as a base for the forest patrol aviation. Culture and recreation The historical center of Velsk, though having lost many of its historical buildings, conforms to the 1780 town plan and is regarded as a historically preserved area. In all, Velsk contains nineteen objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance, most of them being former merchant houses. The following objects are on the list: *the whole architectural ensemble of Velsk *Salnikov House (end of the 19th- beginning of the 20th century) *Istomakhin House (1888) *Shelovanova House (end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th century) *Gorbunova House (1880) *Orlov House (1885) *Kotutin House (1902) *Living House (end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th century) *Trading House (end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th century) *Transfiguration Cathedral (1898‚Äì1913) *a house at 46 Dzerzhinsky Street *a house at 49 Dzerzhinsky Street *Assumption Church (wooden, 1795‚Äì1796) *a house at 4 Komsomolskaya Street *the ensemble of the Lenin Square, including the Popov house and a trading house *prison church *monument to the victims of the Civil War Velsk hosts the Velsky District Museum.

Gateway Distriparks flagged off the first export train service from the newly built inland container depot (ICD) at Viramgam.  History  Around 1090, Minaldevi, the mother of Jayasimha Siddharaja of Chaulukya dynasty who ruled from Anhilwad Patan, commissioned the Mansar lake. Siddhraj added several shrines and temples later. Circa 1484, Viramgam state was founded. Under the strong Mandal chief, Viramgam did not become part of the Muslim Gujarat Sultanate until 1530. Commanding the entrance to Kathiawar, the Mughal governors chose it as the headquarters of the Jhalavad prant (district), and in the disturbances of the eighteenth century, it was the scene of several struggles. Viramgam on map of Ahmedabad district, under Bombay Presidency, British India 1877  Fort  The old town of Viramgam is surrounded by a rectangular, towerflanked brick and stone wall, about 21 miles round. In the wall are five gates: on the north, the Golwadi gate leading to Patan; on the north-east, the Bharwadi gate () leading to the railway station; on the east, the Raipuri or Rayyapur gate () leading to Ahmedabad; on the south-west, the Gangasar gate ; and on the west, the Mansar or Munsar gate (). There are also two unopened gateways on the north-west () and north-east, and in the south face is a window through which water is drawn from the Gangasar lake.  Lakes  The town is surrounded by three reservoirs: the Gangasar lake on the south-east and south, lying outside of the wall except a small portion known as the Gusaria lake; in the south-west beyond the Gangasar gate the Dhunia lake; and in the west the Munsar lake. Munsar lake Munsar lake was built about 1090 by Minaldevi, the mother of Siddhraj Jaisinh. Formerly known as Mansarovar, now shortened into Mansar or Munsar lake is 220 yards round, shaped like the conch and is surrounded by flights of stone steps. Gathering from the west, the water passes into a stone-built eightsided silt-well, kund, with, in a niche in each side, a figure cut in bold relief. From the silt-well, through a stone-lined channel and a three-cylinder tunnel, the water passes into the lake. Over the tunnel is a large pyramid-roofed pavilion repaired by the Marathas, and a temple of Bahuchar Mata, or, as she is locally called, Mansar Mata. Towards the north the steps round the lake are ruinous, and in several places broken roadways run down to the water's edge. Around the top of the steps runs a row of small spire-roofed shrines, many now wanting but once said to have numbered more than 300. In each shrine on one side of the lake is a pedestal, probably for an image of Krishna, and on the other side a round basin, jaladhar, probably sacred to Shiva. On either side of one of the roadways that runs to the water's edge, is a larger temple with a double porch and spire and across the lake is a flat roofed colonnade.  Gangasar lake  The Gangasar lake was built eight hundred years ago by Sufi (Muslim mystic) saint Hazrat Alauddin Shah Chishty with help from Hazrat Islahuddin. He was born Hindu and his birth name was Gangu Vanjara. According to legend, he converted to Islam after watching miracles by Aladdin Shah. He built a lake at the request of Hazrat Aladdin Shah, which was named Gangasagar after his birth name Gangu Vanjara. The name later shortened to Gangasar.  Historical and legendary references  According to Dr. Savliya, author of \\"Ancient lakes of Gujarat,\\" one of the rooms on the Musar lake has ancient writing of the person who built this lake. That is believed to be a proof according to which it seems like this lake was built by King Viramdev Vaghela. In that writing his wife's name is also there, Queen Sumla Devi. According to another story, King Bhimdev II had given land on samvat 1295 of Ghusdi village (now known as Viramgam). That land is used for Musar lake. Still today there is Ghusdiya lake and Ghusdiya ground in Viramgam which proves that earlier Viramgam was known as Ghusdi. According to another story, Barbara Bhut (Ghost) who was slave of King Siddhraj Jaysinh has build this lake in one night.  Geography  Viramgam is located at . It has an average elevation of 32 metres (104 feet). Connectivity/Transportation Air The closest major airport to Viramgam is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (AMD / VAAH). This airport is in Ahmedabad, India and is 71 km from the center of Viramgam and provides connectivity with domestic flights to the Metropolitan and other major cities of India. It also provides many international flights from Ahmedabad to destinations around the world. Rail Viramgam is well connected to other major cities of the country via regular trains. Railway Station(s): Viramgam Junction (VG) Viramgam Railway Station Viramgam used to be the point of intersection of BB & CI Railway and the Saurashtra Railway. Viramgam is at the intersection of four railway lines: Ahmedabad-Viramgam, Viramgam-Surendranagar, Viramgam-Mehsana, and Viramgam-Dhrangdhra-Samakhyali lines. It is at the intersection of the routes splitting towards Kachchh and Saurashtra while travelling from Ahmedabad. It is also having Inland Container Depot (ICD) facility by Gateway Distriparks.

It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the CEACAM1 receptor. It has, like other coronaviruses from genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Embecovirus, an additional hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene. The Murine coronavirus is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice. Prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV, M-CoV (MHV, specifically) had been the best-studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the molecular level. Some strains of M-CoV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis. Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases. A feature of the MHV is that many strains have the hemagglutinin-esterase gene turned into a pseudogene. This does not, however, apply to M-CoVs in general, as other members like PV (Puffinosis coronavirus) retain a functional version of this gene. RNA-RNA recombination Genetic recombination can occur when at least two RNA viral genomes are present in the same infected host cell. RNA-RNA recombination between different strains of the murine coronavirus was found to occur at a very high frequency both in tissue cultureMakino S, Keck JG, Stohlman SA, Lai MM.

J Virol. 1988 May;62(5):1810-3. PMID: 2833625 These findings suggest that RNA-RNA recombination may play a significant role in the natural evolution and neuropathogenesis of coronaviruses. The mechanism of recombination appears to involve template switching during viral genome replication, a process referred to as copy choice recombination.  Strains  Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), which is a strain Rat coronavirus, is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol. Acute infections have high morbidity and tropism for the salivary, lachrymal and harderian glands.

Life In the Battle of Udhuanala (1761) and the Battle of Buxar (1764), Majnu gathered a great number of Muslim faqirs and Hindu sannyasis against the East India Company who took over power in Bengali from the Nawab of Bengal in 1757. His center was in Dinajpur and in Bogra District. Majnu Shah was a faqir of the Madariya Sufi order founded by Syed Badiuduin Qutb-ul Shah Madar. His headquarters was at the shrine of Shah Madar in Makanpur near Kanpur. His first encounter with the British East India Company army on 25 February 1771 with the sepoys led by Lieutenant Feltham in Dinajpur was unsuccessful and he fled to the dargah at Mahasthangarh in Bogra district. He even managed to get a follower from Hindu zamindar family named Moti Giri or Moti Singh.Sannyasi and Fakir Rebellion, Muslim Societies, Vol 6.2 In the winter of 1773, Majnu Shah and his team of faqirs reappeared in Rajshahi district and joined up with a body of sannyasis. On 23 December 1773 they had an encounter with the four companies of sepoys of the British East India Company army. The company army repulsed them again.  Death  Majnu Shah sustained reverses while raiding the areas adjacent to Mymensingh in 1786 in a battle against the East India Company army under Lieutenant Brenan in Kaleswar area. He lost large number of his followers, and some of his wounded followers were carried to Mewat. After 1786 Majnu Shah was not found to lead any expedition. From a report of Lieutenant Brenan it is revealed that Majnu Shah was defeated and wounded in a battle on 8 December 1786. It is likely that with his wound he retired to the dargah of Shah Madar at Maqanpur in Cawnpur (Kanpur) district, where he is reported to have died on 26 January 1788. After his death, his nephew Musa Shah led the faqirs and carried out attacks with muskets and rockets till he was killed in an encounter in 1792.

The film, a parody of the 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne,Hammond 1974, p. 64 follows a fisherman who dreams of traveling by submarine to the bottom of the ocean, where he encounters both realistic and fanciful sea creatures, including a chorus of naiads. Plot Yves, a fisherman, comes home after a tiring day of fishing and soon falls asleep. In his dream, he is visited by the Fairy of the Ocean, who leads him to a submarine. Yves is made Lieutenant-in-Command and sets off on a submarine voyage. A panorama of undersea views follow, including shipwrecks, underwater grottoes, huge shellfish, sea nymphs, sea monsters, starfish, mermaids, and a ballet of naiads. The ballet is interrupted by Yves, whose inexperience with submarines leads him to run his craft aground on a rock. Yves leaves the wrecked submarine and chases after the departing naiads, but is attacked by huge fish and crabs. He escapes and travels past further underwater marvels, including underwater caves, anemones, corals, giant seahorses, and an octopus that attacks him. However, in vengeance for all the fish Yves has caught in his career, goddesses of the sea trap the fisherman in a net and let him fall into a gigantic hollow sponge, from which he struggles to escape. Waking up from the dream, Yves realizes that he has fallen from his bed into his bathtub, and is entangled in his own fishing net. His neighbors and friends free him from the confusion, and he treats them all to drinks at the nearest caf√©.

The dish was based in turn on a dish that Jules's father Antoine Alciatore had created‚ÄîPompano Montgolfierhonoring the brothers who had created the first balloons.Stanforth, Deirdre. The New Orleans Restaurant Cookbook, p.14. Doubleday & Company, 1976. A filet of pompano is baked in a sealed parchment paper envelope with a white sauce of wine, shrimp, and crabmeat. With a bit of luck the steam will puff up the parchment a bit, suggesting a hot air balloon. Notes on Preparation Pompano is a particularly appropriate choice for this kind of preparation. The fillet is uniform in thickness, thus it will cook evenly. A salmon fillet, for example, tends to be thicker at one end than at the other, making it difficult to produce an even result when baking. The texture of pompano is very firm, and so it will not break down when cooked in a sauce, like a trout fillet might. Finally, pompano has a delicate but distinct flavor that will not be lost in the richness of the sauce. The traditional preparation calls for cutting a heart shape out of a piece of parchment paper. A velout√© made with shrimp stock is combined with white wine (or champagne), shrimp, and lump crab meat. The sauce is spooned onto one side of the paper (which has been oiled) and the fish placed on top of that. The other side is folded over and the edges sealed all around. The packet is then placed on an oiled cooking sheet and baked in a hot oven (400 degrees) for about 10 minutes. The browned packets are placed onto plates and served as quickly as possible. Each guest slices open the paper, releasing the aroma. As a Symbol of New Orleans Grand Creole It is tempting in the modern culinary world to view Pompano en Papillote with some derision‚Äîa gimmicky old warhorse of a bygone era. But it is important to understand its place in culinary history. It is in some ways the epitome of New Orleans grand Creole cooking; to understand the dish is to understand the cuisine and the nature of the grand dames of New Orleans restaurants. The presentation of baked fish in a paper envelope is about theater and spectacle. There are no purely culinary reasons to do it. The same effect can be had by baking fish in a shallow dish with a tight lid. As long as the contents can be heated quickly and most of the steam retained, you will get the same basic dish. But grand restaurants are not simply about the food. At their best, they create a sense of specialness, of celebration, of achievement, and even a bit of mystique. Great restaurants today do this. Antoine's has been doing it since the mid 19th century. The presentation en papillote is an attention getter in the dining room, much like a souffl√© has always been, and much like the now played-out towering architectural food of the 1990s was. A tie to France is part of the very concept of New Orleans Creole. The city had come into the United States when Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase in 1803‚Äî almost a hundred years after its founding. It remained an American center for French culture, tradition, and immigration into the twentieth century. The velout√© is one of the 'mother' sauces, foundational in French cuisine. New Orleans took from France, but also began to impart its own spin. The traditional seasoning in the French version would be diced onions (sauteed briefly), salt, white pepper, and a pinch of ground nutmeg. A bouquet garni consisting of parsley, bay leaf, and thyme may have been added to the shrimp stock. New Orleans chefs would have added more onion, a bit of garlic, and a pinch of cayenne pepper (or a splash of hot sauce) in addition to the white pepper, producing a spicier version compared to the classic. Not the tongue searing hotness that came out of the caricature of Cajun food in the 1980s, but rather a piquant that added interest. The final driving force shaping the nature of New Orleans cooking was the richness of the local food products‚Äîin this case, pompano, shrimp, and lump crabmeat. New Orleans (and southern Louisiana) is uniquely situated. It is close to the Gulf of Mexico which yielded pompano, snapper, drum, trout, flounder, mackerel, shrimp, and sea turtle. But it is also part of the Mississippi River delta system and is just south of the wetlands abutting Lake Pontchartrain. From these regions came crab, crawfish, and oysters.

It was named by Major Thomas Mitchell after the three Napier brothers, who he had served alongside during the Peninsular War. Mitchell named it in August 1836, during his third expedition across south- eastern Australia. The local Aboriginal name for the mount is Tapoc. Mount Napier State Park is located 270 kilometres west of Melbourne and 17 km south of Hamilton. Location and features Mount Napier or Tapoc in the local Aboriginal language, has a composite lava shield with a superimposed scoria cone. The cone rises above the surrounding plains to an elevation of , making it the highest point on the Western District Plains of Victoria. Mount Napier is part of the Newer Volcanics Province, which is the youngest volcanic region in Australia. The Newer Volcanics Province covers an area of and contains over 400 vents. The Mount Napier Lava Flow followed the Harman Valley west from the volcano, and then south towards nearby Mount Eccles which is 25 km south-west of Mount Napier. Lava blisters or tumuli occur along the flow - these are house-sized mounds of basalt rocks. The blisters are the best developed in Australia and uncommon in the rest of the world. They are formed by the pressure of liquid lava pushing up against the crust. Several caves and lava tubes can also be found at Byaduk.

With a 'fairly large number of bad characters from various nations,' Lower Shawneetown posed a significant challenge to France and Great Britain alike. The community was less a village and more of a 'district extending along the wide Scioto River and narrower Ohio River floodplains and terraces.' It was a sprawling series of wickiups and longhouses ...

Brown, Salt and the Eastern North American Indian: An Archaeological Study, Cambridge, Mass., 1980. Salt was still being produced as late as 1755 when the captive Mary Draper Ingles was employed in boiling brine before she escaped from Lower Shawneetown in October of that year. Many 18th century European trade goods were also found at the site, including gun spalls and gunflints, gun parts (sideplate, mainspring, ram pipes, and breech plugs), wire-wound and drawn glass beads, tinkling cones, a button, pendants, an earring, cutlery, kettle ears, a key, nails, chisels, hooks, a buckle, a Jew's harp, and pieces of a pair of iron scissors. The Fort Ancient residents of southern Ohio were very likely wiped out in the late seventeenth century by infectious diseases brought by Europeans, particularly measles, smallpox, and influenza. Graves from this period often contain multiple burials‚Äîfrom four to over a hundred individuals‚Äîreflecting a sudden increase in mortality typical of epidemics. Depopulation may have been hastened by Iroquois raids during the Beaver Wars (1629-1701). The region was largely uninhabited when Lower Shawneetown was founded in the early 18th century.

The town also lay near the Seneca Trail, which was used by Cherokees and Catawbas, and it was surrounded by fertile, alluvial flatlands that were ideal for growing corn, beans, squash, gourds, tobacco, and sunflowers. The area adjacent to the town was rich in natural resources: a mosaic of mixed hardwood forests, flat grassy plains, canebrakes, salt and clear freshwater springs, home to deer, bear, elk, and bison.

During the 1740s and 1750s, both the British and the French became increasingly concerned about the growing Native American settlements in the region, including Lower Shawneetown's neighbors, Logstown, Pickawillany, and Sandusky.

Visits by French soldiers The earliest reference to the town is found in a July 27, 1734 letter by Fran√ßois-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, describing an English trader's warehouse (probably that of George Croghan and William Trent) in \\"the home of the Shawnees on the Ohio River.\\" The French had focused much attention on Canada, allowing English traders to establish themselves in the Ohio Valley, but in the late 1730s the French began trying to correct this by sending expeditions into the region. The earliest eyewitness account is a report by Charles III Le Moyne, Baron de Longueuil from July 1739. A French military expedition made up of 123 French soldiers and 319 Native American warriors from Quebec, under the command of Le Moyne, was on its way to help defend New Orleans from the Chickasaw, who were attacking the city on behalf of England. While on their journey down the Ohio River towards the Mississippi River, they met with local chiefs in a village on the banks of the Scioto, which was probably Lower Shawneetown.Charles Augustus Hanna, The Wilderness Trail: Or, The Ventures and Adventures of the Pennsylvania Traders on the Allegheny Path, Volume 1, Putnam's sons, 1911 Concerned that this vibrant community would be readily influenced by trade goods supplied by the British, the Governor of New France, Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois sent emissaries to Lower Shawneetown in 1741 to try to persuade the Shawnees to relocate to Detroit, but the proposal was rejected. Visit by C√©loron de Blainville Map of the route followed by Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville along the Ohio River in 1749, drawn by Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps. \\"Sinhioto\\" (Lower Shawneetown) appears at the lower edge.In the summer of 1749 Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville, leading a force of eight officers, six cadets, an armorer, 20 soldiers, 180 Canadians, 30 Iroquois and 25 Abenakis, moved down the Ohio River on his \\"lead plate expedition,\\" burying lead plates at six locations where major tributaries entered the Ohio. The plates were inscribed to claim the area for France. C√©loron also sought out British traders and warned them to leave this territory which belonged to France. C√©loron arrived at the town of \\"St. Yotoc\\" on 21 August, where a Lenape Indian they met informed them that the town consisted of \\"about 80 cabins there, and perhaps 100.\\" Father Bonnecamps, the geographer of Celoron's expedition, wrote: > The situation of the village of the Chaouanons is quite pleasant, at least, > it is not masked by the mountains, like the other villages through which we > had passed. The Sinhioto River, which bounds it on the west, has given it > its name. It is composed of about sixty cabins. The Englishmen there > numbered five. Conference between French and Native American leaders around 1750 by √âmile Louis Vernier.Hearing that a French military force was approaching, the inhabitants had hastily erected a stockade. C√©loron described it as a \\"stone fort, strongly built and in good condition for their defense.\\" He sent a delegation of Kahnawake and Abenaki Indians led by Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, but as they approached the town, warriors manning the stockade fired three shots at them, all of which struck the French flag they were carrying. Shortly afterwards, a canoe bearing a white flag approached C√©loron's camp, and Shawnee and Iroquois leaders from Lower Shawneetown met with C√©loron. They apologized for the shots fired at the French delegation, saying that they had feared that the French were planning to attack the town. The Shawnees invited him to enter the town and address them in their council-house, but C√©loron was wary of being ambushed: > I was aware of the weakness of my detachment; two-thirds were recruits who > had never made an attack...[The Indians] being much displeased, it would > have been a great imprudence to go to their village. C√©loron negotiated with the leaders of the town for two days but he was unable to persuade them to abandon their loyalty to the English, as \\"the cheap merchandise which the English furnished was [a] very seducing motive for them to remain attached to the latter.\\" On 25 August he summoned the five Pennsylvania traders who were then living in the town and ordered them to leave, stating that \\"they had no right to trade or aught else on the [Ohio] River.\\" C√©loron considered plundering their goods, but as he was confronted by a large and well-armed Shawnee force, he desisted and continued on his way.Ian K. Steele, Setting All the Captives Free: Capture, Adjustment, and Recollection in Allegheny Country, Vol. 71 of McGill-Queen's Native and Northern Series; McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2013. C√©loron's expedition was intended to impress the inhabitants of the Ohio River Valley with the capability of the French to maintain control over the region, but it met with defiance and resulted in a weakening of the French position. Commerce with British traders 1755 map showing \\"Lor. Shawnee T.\\" at the junction of the Scioto and Ohio rivers, lower left of map's center.William Trent established a storehouse in Lower Shawneetown sometime around 1734, and the Shawnees kept it secure in order to encourage further trade with the British. Between 1748 and 1751 the British traders Andrew Montour and George Croghan visited the town three times while attempting to strengthen the alliance between the Shawnees and the British government. When C√©loron visited the town in August 1749, he found five English traders \\"established...in the village and well sustained by the Indians.\\" In 1750, the Ohio Company hired Christopher Gist, a skilled woodsman and surveyor, to explore the Ohio Valley in order to identify lands for potential settlement. He surveyed the Kanawhan Region and the Ohio Valley tributaries in 1750‚Äì1751 and 1753. In January 1751 Gist, Croghan and Montour, accompanied by Robert Callender, visited the town. Gist's journal entry from January 29, 1751 states: > Tuesday 29.‚Äî Set out ... to the Mouth of Sciodoe Creek opposite to the > Shannoah Town, here we fired our Guns to alarm the Traders, who soon > answered, and came and ferryed Us over to the Town ‚Äî The Land about the > Mouth of Sciodoe Creek is rich but broken fine Bottoms upon the River & > Creek.

Christopher Gist, surveyor who visited Lower Shawneetown in 1751. Engraving from ‚Äò‚ÄôEmerson's Magazine and Putnam's Monthly,‚Äô‚Äô 1857.Annosanah: A Novel Based on the Life of Christopher GistThe journal terminates with a detailed description of a festival Gist witnessed during his stay in Lower Shawneetown.The Journal of Christopher Gist, 1750‚Äì1751 From Lewis P. Summers, 1929, Annals of Southwest Virginia, 1769‚Äì1800. Abingdon, VA. When the town was destroyed by flooding in 1753, British traders relocated with the rest of the town's population, intending to maintain their profitable businesses. In the 1918 edition of Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison, George P. Donehoo, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission, records: > Shortly after 1753 the village...was destroyed by a flood. The town was then > built up on the south side of the Ohio. George Croghan, William Trent and > other Indian traders had trading houses at this place. Croghan's large > store...was destroyed by the French and Indians in 1754.James Everett > Seaver, Charles Delamater Vail A Narrative of the Life of Mary Jemison: The > White Woman of the Genesee, American Scenic and Historic Preservation > Society, 1918. Archeological evidence shows that, by the 1750s, trade had transformed the lives of the residents of the town. Traders brought guns, metal tools, knives, saddles, hatchets, glass and ceramic beads, brooches, strouds (a kind of coarse blanket), ruffled and plain shirts, coats, clay tobacco pipes, brass and iron pots, and rum to trade for the furs and skins of deer, elk, bison, bear, beaver, raccoon, fox, wildcat, muskrat, mink and fisher. Town residents wore European-style glass beads, silver earrings, armbands, and brooches, rather than traditional Native American beads and pendants made from shell, animal teeth, or animal bone. Cloth matchcoats, blankets, skirts, and shirts supplemented moccasins and garments manufactured from animal skins. Lower Shawneetown's size and connections to neighboring communities allowed traders to establish storehouses for incoming and outgoing goods, managed by European men who lived in the town year-round and sometimes married Native American women. These trading posts attracted local hunters to bring skins and furs to the town, meaning that a post in Lower Shawneetown could do profitable business with dozens of villages without requiring the traders themselves to travel, as they had done previously. The town's location on the Ohio River allowed traders to send furs and skins by canoe up to Logstown, where they were taken by packhorses over the mountains, transferred into wagons for a fourteen-day journey to Philadelphia and then shipped to London. Captives At least five captives taken during raids on American pioneer settlements are known to have lived in or visited Lower Shawneetown. Catherine Gougar (1732‚Äì1801) was kidnapped in 1744 from her home in Berks County, Pennsylvania and lived in the town for five years.Caroline S. Coldren, \\"Catherine Gougar Goodman,\\" monograph, April 1940; Family History Library.Catherine Gougar Goodman She was eventually sold to French-Canadian traders and after two more years in Canada, managed to return home in 1751.Frank Warner, \\"Catherine Gougar,\\" Ohio History, Volume 31; Ohio Historical Society., 1922. Mary Draper Ingles (1732‚Äì1815) was kidnapped during the Draper's Meadow massacre in July 1755 and taken to Lower Shawneetown. French traders were living in the town at that time, selling cloth, and Ingles demonstrated her skill in sewing shirts, for which she was paid \\"in goods.\\" She stayed in the town for about three weeks before being taken to Big Bone Lick to make salt by boiling brine. She and another captive escaped in mid- October, 1755, and walked several hundred miles to return home. An article in the New-York Mercury of 16 February 1756, describing Mary's capture and escape mentions that, while in Lower Shawneetown, she saw \\"a considerable Number of English Prisoners, who have been taken Captives from the Frontiers of Virginia.\\" The same newspaper article states that she saw Captain Samuel Stalnaker, who had been captured during a raid on Holston River in Tennessee on June 18, 1755. A letter from Governor Robert Dinwiddie dated 21 June 1756, reports that he later escaped, although no details are given.Robert A. Brock, ed. The official records of Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant-governor of the Colony of Virginia, 1751-1758, Richmond: The Society, 1883-84; p. 447.Lewis Preston Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 1746-1786, Washington County, 1777-1870, J.L. Hill Print. Company, 1903.Indian Attacks of 1755-1758 in Augusta County, VA Moses Moore and Isham Bernat were captured in Virginia and taken to Lower Shawneetown in the spring of 1758. Bernat was living at his plantation near the Irwin River when he was taken prisoner by a party of Shawnees, Wyandots, Delawares and Mingoes on 31 March 1758. Moore was hunting beaver in Augusta County when he was taken prisoner by a party of Wyandots in April, 1758. They were held for a few days in Lower Shawneetown before escaping and walking for 23 days to reach Pittsburgh.Samuel Hazard, ed. Pennsylvania Archives: 1st Series: Selected and Arranged from Original Documents in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Conformably to Acts of the General Assembly, February 15, 1851, and March 1, 1852. Pennsylvania, Secretary of the Commonwealth. J. Severns, 1853; pp. 632-33. Destruction and relocation This 1779 map shows \\"Shannoah\\" on the Ohio River, although the town was abandoned in 1758.John P. Hale states that in about November, 1758, > ... a very extreme, if not unprecedented, flood in the rivers swept off a > greater part of the town, and it was never rebuilt at that place; but the > tribe moved its headquarters ... up the Scioto and built up successively the > Old and New Chillicothe, or Che-le-co-the Towns. There remained a Shawnee > village at the mouth of the Scioto, which was then built upon the other > side, the present site of the city of Portsmouth.John P. Hale, Trans- > Allegheny pioneers : historical sketches of the first white settlements west > of the Alleghenies, Cincinnati: The Graphic Press, 1886. When Mary Jemison, a captive of the Seneca, spent the winter at the mouth of the Scioto River in 1758‚Äì1759, Lower Shawneetown had been abandoned and relocated further up the Scioto River. It is possible that this new village was Chalahgawtha at the site of present-day Chillicothe, Ohio. George P. Donehoo says: > In 1758, the first year of Mary Jemison's going there, the Shawnee moved > their town (the Lower Shawnee Town) from the mouth of the Scioto to the > upper plains of the Scioto, sending for the Shawnees of Logstown to join > them there and possibly also for the Shawnees of the Shawnee Town at the > mouth of the Great Kanawha to do the same. Legacy A. Gwynn Henderson argues that multiethnic \\"supervillages\\" such as Lower Shawneetown might be considered early Native American city-states because of their political autonomy and the new opportunities they created for different tribes as well as for the interaction of Native Americans with Europeans: > \\"The intermarriage and ethnic diversity within these settlements created a > multitude of new kinship and social situations, adding layers of ethnic, > social, and village relationships. Thus, the potential for factionalism and > the development of different European responses may have been even greater > in these villages than in traditional single-ethnic villages. As autonomous > communities, these republics existed politically beyond the control of the > French, British, and even the Six Nations at Onondaga, and their residents > were responsible only to themselves. Thus, they had the freedom to make > decisions based on their own needs, traditions, and cultural proscriptions, > and they could ally themselves with whomever they wished or change their > alliances when it suited their needs. Lower Shawneetown's diversity prevented it from operating as a political entity, however. Independent factions, themselves often divided, responded individually to events, to the frustration of European envoys. Community leaders were rarely able to unify a majority in backing policy decisions, which prevented Europeans from establishing firm diplomatic relations with Lower Shawneetown as they did (to some extent) at Logstown.

In 2016, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for its National Film Registry. Plot A strange giant \\"sea monster\\" has been rampaging the seas. The United States naval ship Abraham Lincoln is sent to investigate, but the vessel is rammed and damaged by the \\"monster\\" which turns out to be Nautilus, the technologically advanced submarine of the enigmatic Captain Nemo. The Abraham Lincoln, now rudderless from the attack, is adrift. Then, in a \\"strange rescue\\", Nemo guides his submarine directly beneath four people who had been aboard the American ship and who had fallen into the sea during the attack. Nautilus surfaces and Nemo's own crew now bring the four individuals into the submarine through one of its deck hatches. The four include the master harpooner Ned Land, the French professor Pierre Aronnax, his daughter, and the professor's assistant. Once aboard the submarine, the four are required by Nemo to pledge they will not attempt to escape. The captain then introduces them to his vessel and to the wonders of its underwater realm. He later takes them hunting on the sea floor. Meanwhile, not far from the submarine, soldiers in a runaway Union Army balloon are marooned on a mysterious island, where they find a wild girl living alone. Soon the yacht of Charles Denver arrives at the island. A former British colonial officer in India, he has been haunted by the ghost of a woman (Princess Daaker) whom he attacked years ago. Rather than submit to him sexually, she had stabbed and killed herself. Denver then fled with her young daughter but later abandoned the child on the island. Long tormented by what he had done, he has returned to find the girl or to determine what happened to her. One of the Union soldiers schemes and kidnaps the wild girl onto Denver's yacht. Another soldier swims aboard to rescue her. At the same time, Nemo discovers that the yacht belongs to Denver, the enemy he has been seeking all these years. The Nautilus destroys the yacht with a torpedo, but the girl and her rescuer are saved from the water by Captain Nemo. In elaborate flashback scenes to India, Nemo reveals that he is Prince Daaker, and that he created the Nautilus to seek revenge on Charles Denver. He is overjoyed to discover that the abandoned wild girl is his long-lost daughter, but his emotion is such that he expires. His loyal crew bury him at the ocean bottom. They disband and the Nautilus is left to drift.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film Cast * Allen Holubar as Capt.

It is bordered by 16th Avenue to the north, 41st Avenue to the south, Oak Street to the east, and East Boulevard to the west. The older section of the neighbourhood, called \\"First Shaughnessy,\\" is considered more prestigious and is bordered by 16th Avenue to the north, King Edward Avenue to the south, Cambie Street to the east, and East Boulevard to the west. In 2011, the population was approximately 8,807. It was named after Thomas Shaughnessy, 1st Baron Shaughnessy, former president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The neighbourhood's residents have an average annual household income of $105,000 ($777,184 in Shaughnessy Heights) and the average house price is $2.89 million, the highest in Vancouver.http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Shaughnessy- census-data.pdf It is also the site of many historical homes, especially in First Shaughnessy. Of the neighbourhood's homes 51.5% were built before or during World War II, compared with 20.8% for the city at large. This is largely due to the 1981 First Shaughnessy Official Development Plan by-law, which promotes private property ownership and single-family dwelling, while limiting property subdivision and population density. The neighbourhood was created in 1907 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the largest real estate developer in Canada. It was meant as an alternative to the West End, which was the traditional home for the budding city's elite. Thanks to aggressive marketing by the railway, highly regulated development, and a stronger degree of exclusiveness, it gradually took the latter's status over the past century. Shaughnessy is known for its elegant tree-lined streets and large properties. In First Shaughnessy, Angus Drive and Osler Street have a tree-lined median in addition to the trees along the edge of the road. Crescent Park as seen in the 1930s Shaughnessy is home to Little Flower Academy, Vancouver College, and York House School. The public elementary schools are Shaughnessy Elementary and Quilchena Elementary. There is one public high school in Shaughnessy, Point Grey Secondary. The neighbourhood is in the catchment area of each of Eric Hamber Secondary School, in Oakridge, or Prince of Wales Secondary School, in Arbutus Ridge. Shaughnessy has five parks, including Shaughnessy Park, formally known as Crescent Park, and Angus Park in First Shaughnessy. The other three parks in Shaughnessy are Devonshire Park, Kerrisdale Park, and VanDusen Botanical Garden, located between 33rd and 41st Avenues. The Arbutus Greenway, purchased by the City of Vancouver from Canadian Pacific Railway, stretches along the western border of Shaughnessy from 41st Avenue to 16th Avenue.

Franconia Mennonite Conference was a conference of Mennonite Church USA based in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, with 45 congregations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont, New York and California and 19 conference related ministries. In February 2020, Franconia Mennonite Conference merged with Eastern District Conference to become Mosaic Mennonite Conference. It is a member of Mennonite World Conference. History As the oldest Mennonite body in America, Franconia Conference is a three-century-old Mennonite ‚Äúcongregation of congregations‚Äù in southeastern Pennsylvania. Comprising about fifty congregations with some 7,000 members, it dates the arrival of its first members at Germantown near Philadelphia in 1683, and the first baptisms a quarter-century later in 1708. The caution which delayed the first baptisms is symbolic of the desire for authentic church order, characteristic of the Franconia tradition. The act of conferring is at the heart of the historic Mennonite concern to ‚Äúgive and receive counsel‚Äù in the fellowship or body of Christ‚Äôs followers. Thus, Mennonites have found the English term ‚Äúconference‚Äù‚Äîused by Methodists since 1744‚Äîas the best equivalent for the German term Rath (counsel), originally used in this community of immigrants from Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. to the west, Mennonite leaders centered in Lancaster County proceeded similarly, using the word Zusammenkunft (gathering). Drawing on European conferences dating back to 1527, Mennonite bishops who had immigrated to present-day Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Berks Counties endorsed in 1725 a ‚Äúbrotherly agreement‚Äù originally drawn up in the Dutch Republic in 1632 and affirmed by Swiss leaders in 1660. By 1735 the American bishops were conferring repeatedly over new issues in their American environment. Their central concern was how to preserve and keep vital the fundamental issues of non-violent witness to their Christian faith. The American Revolutionary War tested the bonds of this fellowship as leaders discussed the proper way to express historic Mennonite convictions against participating in warfare and taking oaths. A developing sense of a geographic center shifting from Skippack to Franconia was firmly established by the 1840s. In this era, progressive-minded leaders thrust beyond the protective traditional emphasis on accountability to a freer, more congregational, education-oriented, missional and innovative style of conference. As a result, since 1847, there had been two parallel fellowships. However, after a century and a half of non-fellowship, strong mutual affirmation and cooperation have reappeared. (In 2020, these two conferences completed their reconciliation and merged to become Mosaic Mennonite Conference.) Without the more progressive element, the original Franconia Conference maintained its traditional, guarded church order, through the Civil War and World War I periods. As the local Pennsylvania German language gave way to English with the dawning of the twentieth century, attempts to guard against change and worldliness produced a codification of traditional rules, and eventually a written constitution. At the same time, as conservative Mennonites began to learn outreach from neighboring Christians, youthful energy broke through into the forming of local mission congregations. Some twenty new congregations appeared from these efforts, ranging from Philadelphia to New England. A steady growth of institutions began with a retirement home in 1914, followed by a mission board, an ‚ÄúAid Plan,‚Äù a periodical, church schools, and young people entering higher education of all kinds. These changes were further stimulated by the return of young people from widespread voluntary or drafted non-military service in World War II. With the 1950s came mission outreach to Mexico, where conference congregations today have sister fellowships. Members of Salford Mennonite Church's sister congregation, Dios con Nosotros. As the written code of rules gave way in the 1960s to more congregational initiatives and discernment, the original role of bishops changed from that of control to that of counsel and encouragement. This was finally folded into a concept of ‚Äúconference‚Äù that was more supportive and administrative than controlling. Nevertheless, a sense of responsibility for maintaining faithful scriptural standards has fostered a continuing credentialing for ministry of all sorts. Access to the heritage of faith is available in archives sponsored jointly with the ‚ÄúEastern District Conference‚Äù that emerged in 1847. In the 1970s, the older usage of ‚Äúconference‚Äù as the collective body of ordained persons changed in the direction of ‚Äúassembly,‚Äù with strong involvement by lay members, new leadership roles for women, and the increase presence of many non-ethnic Mennonites, but a church fellowship they had espoused for its concern to follow Christ. Room was made where desired for charismatic motifs, more congregational initiative, and overhaul of traditional structures. In connection with the larger Mennonite denomination, a ‚ÄúConfession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective (1995) was accepted, along with membership, in the year 2000, in a joint ‚ÄúMennonite Church USA.‚Äù Franconia Conference has had trouble in recent decades dealing with issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, with one of its congregations fully embracing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons. The conference removed Germantown Mennonite Church from its membership in 1997,Germantown Mennonite Church from Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online and in 2009 began the process of removing Alpha Mennonite Church of New Jersey for standing with its openly gay pastor. Alpha eventually changed pastors and remains with the conference.Lechiski, Kevin. Alpha Mennonite Church faces removal from membership.

He is considered one of the most prominent representatives of the Warsaw School of the History of Ideas. Life Szacki was born in Warsaw in 1929. After World War II, worked for the Polish Telephone Authority, first as a locksmith, later in a desk job. In 1948, he began to study sociology at the University of Warsaw. Incidentally, his was the last class to graduate before sociology was declared a \\"bourgeois\\" discipline and the sociological departments of Polish universities were closed in 1952. Szacki himself was sent to work in the Wroc≈Çaw-based train wagon factory Pafawag. In 1956, when the sociological department in Warsaw re-opened, Szacki returned there to obtain a Ph.D. degree. He wrote his thesis at the \\"Institute for the Education of Research Staff\\" (Instytut Kszta≈Çcenia Kadr Naukowych), which was attached to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and was soon afterwards renamed to \\"Institute for Social Sciences\\" (Instytut Nauk Spo≈Çecznych), whose director at the time was Bronis≈Çaw Baczko. Szacki completed his habilitation at the department of philosophy in 1965. He was appointed \\"extraordinary professor\\" in 1973 and \\"ordinary professor\\" in 1987, the highest rank in Polish academe. In the meantime, Szacki held various administrative positions at the University of Warsaw, including Vice-Dean of the Department of Social Sciences (1967‚Äì1968), Dean of the Department of Philosophy and Sociology (1981‚Äì1983), and director of the Institute for the History of Social Thought within the Institute of Sociology (1968‚Äì1999). Szacki retired from the university in 1999, but has been teaching at the private university-level Warsaw School of Social Sciences and Humanities since 2003.

From 1972 to 1976, Szacki was the president of the Polish Sociological Association, and held numerous further administrative positions, including in the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). From 1974 to 1991, he was editor-in-chief of the Polish Sociology Bulletin.Antoni Sulek, \\"The Multifarious and Changing Functions of the Polish Sociological Association\\", International Sociology, Szacki is perhaps most noted for his monumental Historia my≈õli socjologicznej (\\"History of Sociological Thought\\"). Written in Minneapolis and Oxford and originally published in English in 1979, it failed to make a strong impact on international sociology, but remains a popular textbook among Polish teachers and students of sociology until this day. The updated edition of 2002 was awarded with the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science (Nagroda Fundacji na rzecz Nauki Polskiej), colloquially dubbed the \\"Polish Nobel Prize\\", in 2003 In the 1970s, Szacki began to maintain contacts with oppositional circles, although he never became an active figure in politics. In 1978, he participated in the informal discussion group Do≈õwiadczenie i Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá, which brought together pro- and anti-government intellectuals. In 1991, Szacki co-founded the Solidarno≈õƒá Pracy (Labour Solidarity), a short-lived social-democratic party formed by left-wing Solidarity members, which merged with the Labour Union (Unia Pracy) the following year. In 1998, he prefaced a book about the Gda≈Ñsk-based milieu of Polish liberals edited by the politician Donald Tusk (then a member of the Freedom Union). In 1994, Szacki published a book on Liberalism after communism (original title Liberalizm po komunizmie), which was translated into English and other languages and received favourable reviews in the West. In it, Szacki addresses the challenges faced by liberal democracy in an environment shaped by decades of communism and earlier non-democratic governments - a topic that has occupied much of Szacki's academic publications and popular essays in the general press. Szacki also translated several classic works from English and French into Polish: Some English-language writings by Florian Znaniecki, a pioneering Polish sociologist, as well as √âmile Durkheim's classic work Les R√®gles de la m√©thode sociologique, Jean-Pierre Vernant's Les origines de la pens√©e grecque and Marcel Mauss's Sociologie et anthropologie.

The first performance of Catilina in Norway not under Ibsen's pseudonym (Brynjolf Bjarme) was at Det Nye Teater in Oslo on 24 August 1935. Forced to support himself after his father's economic downfall, during a national economic crisis, Ibsen went to Grimstad as a pharmacist's apprentice. There he both prepared himself for university and experimented with various forms of poetry. While studying, he found himself passionately drawn into the Catiline orations, famous speeches by Cicero against the elected questor Catiline and his conspiracy to overthrow the republic. Ibsen chose this conspirator as the subject for his initial effort, finishing Catiline in 1849. Ibsen expresses in the prologue to the second edition (1875) that he was profoundly inspired by the contemporary political situation of Europe, and that he favored the Magyar uprising against the Habsburg empire. He explains that the case of Catiline had special interest for him, because \\"there are given few examples of historical persons, whose memory has been more entirely in the possession of their conquerors, than Catiline\\". Thus, Catiline can be read as one of Ibsen's troubled (and troubling) heroes, alongside Brand and Gregers Werle. The play appeared in Christiania the following spring under Ibsen's early pseudonym, Brynjolf Bjarme. The main character in this historical drama is the noble Roman Lucius Catilina, based on the historical figure of Catiline. He is torn between two women, his wife Aurelia and the Vestal virgin Furia. As characteristic of Ibsen's early work, the play is in blank verse. Although Catiline may not be among Ibsen's best plays, it foreshadows many of the themes found in his later works. Catilina, full of doubts and torn between love and duty, is similar to protagonists in John Gabriel Borkman and The Master Builder. Furia is also the prototype of some of the later female characters, such as Hedda Gabler. Ibsen was not the first playwright to dramatize the story of Catiline. Ben Jonson wrote a tragedy on the subject, called Catiline, His Conspiracy, in 1611. Asked later what he had read when he wrote Catiline, Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish Norse saga-inspired Romantic tragedian Adam Oehlenschl√§ger and Ludvig Holberg, \\"the Scandinavian Moli√®re\\".

It features the character Captain Nemo and is inspired by Jules Verne's 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It was written by Pip and Jane Baker.Variety film review; 17 December 1969, page 24. Plot Captain Nemo's submarine Nautilus rescues drowning passengers and takes them to an underwater city, Templemer (pronounced Temple- Meer) where they are told they will remain forever. The survivors include brothers Barnaby (Bill Fraser) and Swallow Bath (Kenneth Connor), Lomax (Allan Cuthbertson), Helena Beckett (Nanette Newman) and her son, and Senator Robert Fraser (Chuck Connors). Nemo takes them on a city scuba tour, but Lomax attempts to steal diving gear and escape but is caught. Fraser seems taken with a musical performance given by the city's swimming teacher Mala (Luciana Paluzzi), this noted by Joab, Nemo‚Äôs second in command (John Turner). Joab shows the Bath brothers how the city makes oxygen and fresh water and as a by- product gold, which is even thrown away. Joab advises them that no one has ever escaped Templemer. Lomax sees the oxygen machine as a means to escape by rupturing the city's dome. Lomax attempts this but only manages to flood the machine‚Äôs control room killing himself in the process. During this episode, the Bath brothers sneak into the Forbidden Area where they discover a second submarine, the Nautilus II, and see it as a means of escape. Enlisting Fraser to aid them, Fraser learns how to operate the submarine. During training they ram and kill a vast Manta Ray-like creature accidentally created during the building of the city. Fraser tells Nemo he should leave as he is attempting to cut off the supply of weapons to the American Civil War. Nemo refuses but offers Fraser a position at Templemer. This alienates Joab, who helps Fraser and the Baths steal Nautilus II, on condition they leave without bloodshed, and allow the crew to return with the submarine intact. They manage to take the submarine and are followed by Nemo in his submarine. Nemo explains there is fault with the Nautilus II's engines that means the sub could explode. The chase is brief. Unable to match the speed of the escaping submarine, Nemo has Nautilus I sheer away, to try 'going under the reef.' Confused by their pursuers apparently giving up, Fraser asks the Nautilus II's first mate if there is 'a shorter way,' and is told 'yes, there is,' but that 'this ship is too large!' A now desperate Fraser gives orders for 'crash speed.' As the submarine increases to flank an explosion causes the engines to fail, and out of control the ship strikes a reef before coming to a stop whilst still submerged. The crew with Fraser and the Baths put on diving gear and attempt to escape from the now flooding submarine, but Barnaby panics (weighed down by too much stolen gold by-product) and drowns in the attempt. Nautilus I approaches the wreck just in time to be buffeted violently as the bigger ship explodes; Joab is electrocuted as he is thrown against a control panel. Mortally wounded he confesses to Nemo that he helped Fraser to escape. Helena Beckett admits that she knew of the attempt, and that she and her son chose to stay. Mala reads Nemo a letter that Fraser left behind, in which he thanks Nemo for offering him a place in the city's future, but that he cannot accept, as he believes in his mission, and the 'slower, more painful process' towards peace. The film closes as Nautilus turns towards Templemer. On the surface, a small schooner is seen picking up two men in mid-ocean, far from either land or any sign of wreckage. Fraser and Swallow Bath, huddled in blankets, are made welcome aboard, and as the schooner prepares to set sail, Fraser finds his companion has concealed a gold ladle under his coat. The two exchange rueful smiles, and Fraser tosses it lightly into the sea. Production The film was produced on a budget of 1.5 million US dollars. It had stemmed from an idea that led to Roger Corman‚Äôs failed Captain Nemo and the Floating City, itself based on a combination of two of Jules Verne‚Äôs stories. Though that movie never passed the planning stage, MGM producer Steven Pallos managed to re-create the project having read a series of inspirational articles about Jacques Cousteau‚Äôs experiments with deep sea habitats, and the 'floating' was changed to 'underwater'. The film drew heavily on the supposed charm of the Victorian era, following agreement between director and scriptwriters to produce a popular escapist atmosphere, more the essence of Michael Todd‚Äôs Around the World in Eighty Days than of Disney‚Äòs 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial ‚Äì based on feudal responsibilities ‚Äì and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. Each manor had its own laws promulgated in a document called the custumal, and anyone in breach of those laws could be tried in a manorial court. The earlier Anglo-Saxon method of trial by ordeal or of compurgation was modified by the Normans into trial by a jury made up of 12 local freemen. The lord or his steward would be the chairman, whilst the parish clerk would write the record on the manorial rolls. Manorial courts The three types of manorial court were distinguished by the importance of those who made use of them. The court of honour was for the manor's chief tenants, the court baron for other free tenants, and the court customary was for unfree tenants. Court of the honour The honour court, also known as the curia ducis (\\"duke's court\\") or curia militum (\\"soldiers' court\\"), was made up of the most important of a lord's tenants, particularly those who owed him knight service. Unlike the other two types of manorial court its jurisdiction could extend over a number of manors. Dealing as it did with the most important of the lord's tenants it was initially the principal manorial court, and may have acted as a superior court of appeal for the lower manorial courts, at least until 1267. Court baron The main business of the court baron was the resolution of disputes involving a lord's free tenants within a single manor, to enforce the feudal services owed to the lord of the manor by his tenants, and to admit new tenants who had acquired copyholds by inheritance or purchase, for which they were obliged to pay a fine to the lord of the manor. The English jurist Edward Coke described the court in his The Compleate Copyholder (1644) as \\"the chief prope and pillar of a manor which no sooner faileth than the manor falleth to the ground\\". The court baron was constituted by the lord of the manor or his steward and a representative group of tenants known as the manorial homage, whose job was to make presentations to the court and act as a jury. The court baron was originally held every three weeks, although its sittings became increasingly infrequent during the 14th century, and by the 15th century it was often convened only twice a year. Those required to attend were summoned to appear, often by an announcement in church on Sunday or by a notice pinned to the church door. \\"Reasonable notice\\" had to be given, usually three days. Attendance at the court was a feudal duty, and those who failed to appear could be amerced, i.e. arbitrarily fined. After 1267 however, generally only a manor's unfree tenants could be compelled to attend. By the 13th century compilations of precedents such as Le Court de Baron had begun to appear, partly to standardise and formalise the proceedings of the courts baron, but also in response to increasing competition from the common law courts, which were administered nationwide under the authority of the monarch. As it became increasingly acknowledged by the legal establishment during the 15th and 16th centuries that custom had \\"a secure place in law\\", plaintiffs were able to resort to the common law courts to resolve their differences over tenure rather than the court baron. Court customary The court customary, or halmote court, was the equivalent of the court baron for the lord's unfree tenants. As the use of the court baron declined, the court customary became the predominant type of manorial court, and gradually the court's distinction between free and unfree tenants disappeared. Royal courts In some cases the manorial court functioned as a de facto court leet. The lord of the manor could be given a post by the central government, such as sheriff or officer in charge of the county, in return for a small payment. In these cases the manorial court's jurisdiction could in effect become county-wide. Alternatively, the lord could acquire a franchise of the Crown to hold court for criminal matters. This jurisdiction was that of court leet and view of frankpledge (the two terms define the same assembly), the manor freemen being the jury of a \\"crown\\" court within the manor's area.

In 1984, after a series of robberies in the station, Pfizer, which has a plant located one block away from the station, installed four closed circuit TVs and talk-back boxes on the platforms, monitoring them from the Pfizer plant security area, reporting crimes to the local precinct and TA police. The installation was completed as part of the TA's Adopt-A-Station Program and cost $50,000. The TA added additional lighting in a stairwell and added an additional Off-Hours- Waiting Area. Shortly after the installation, several crimes were prevented. As of 1990, the emergency system resulted in 14 arrests and 5 convictions. Pfizer also helped the MTA refurbish the Brooklyn-bound platform with high- entry turnstiles, security gates and new railings. New artwork was also added to the station. Under the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program, this station, along with 32 others, would have undergone a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would have included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, and improved signage and station lighting. However, most of these renovations are being deferred until the 2020-2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding.  Station layout  This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have a lime green trim line on a darker green border and name tablets reading \\"FLUSHING AVE.\\" in white sans serif font on a dark green background and lime green border. Underneath the trim line and name tablets are black name and direction tiles in white lettering. Exits Northbound stair The platforms each have one same-level fare control area at their south ends and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow a free transfer between directions. Each area has a turnstile bank, two full height turnstiles (one exit-only and the other high entry/exit), token booth, and one staircase to the street. The one on the southbound side goes up to the southwest corner of Flushing and Marcy Avenues while the one on the Queens-bound side goes up to the northeast corner of Union Avenue (which becomes Marcy Avenue at the intersection of Flushing Avenue) and Gerry Street (which begins diagonally at the aforementioned intersection). The turnstile bank and token booth on the southbound platform is only open on weekdays and the two full height turnstiles provide entrance to and exit from the station at other times. The station formerly had another exit at the north end as proven by one gated staircase on each platform going up. Directional signs indicate that this mezzanine and crossover, which are now used for storage and employee space, led to both southern corners of Walton Street and Union Avenue. Both staircases were eventually sealed, and the one to the southwestern corner was partly demolished during the construction of new buildings.

Banahaw, Luzon, Philippines in 1989 Kelimutu, Flores, Indonesia A complex volcano, also called a compound volcano, is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock. They may form due to changes in eruptive habit or in the location of the principal vent area on a particular volcano. Stratovolcanoes can also form a large caldera that gets filled in by a lava dome, or else multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may develop on the caldera's rim. Although a comparatively unusual type of volcano, they are widespread in the world and in geologic history. Metamorphosed ash flow tuffs are widespread in the Precambrian rocks of northern New Mexico, which indicates that caldera complexes have been important for much of Earth's history. Yellowstone National Park is on three partly covered caldera complexes. The Long Valley Caldera in eastern California is also a complex volcano; the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado are formed on a group of Neogene-age caldera complexes, and most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks of Nevada, Idaho, and eastern California are also caldera complexes and their erupted ash flow tuffs.

Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 4,413. The total number of literates in Warud was 37,422, which constituted 82.3% of the population with male literacy of 84.2% and female literacy of 80.2%.

Transportation Railway Warud Orange City (WOC) Railway Station Board Narkhed and Amravati towns in Maharashtra's orange belt have waited for more than 80 years to be linked by rail. The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84 billion approved. The then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao laid the foundation stone. But protests by the Shiv Sena, which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years. In September 2008, when President Pratibha Patil inaugurated the New Amravati railway station, it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010. Narkhed-Amravati line is ready on January 2014. Railways are now available to travel from Narkhed to Bhusaval. Warud's railway station has given the name Warud Orange City because it is the biggest exporter of oranges from all over the India. The railway station is 3 km from the centre of the Warud city. The Amravati - Chandur Bazar - Morshi - Warud Orange City - Narkher railway track is electrified. People of Warud can travel by train to cities like Amravati, Akola, Shegaon, Bhusawal, Washim, Hingoli, Nanded, Hyderabad, Narkher, Morshi, Chandur Bazar, Badnera, Indore, Bhopal, Banglore Roadways There is a Warud MSRTC Depot of Maharashtra State Transport (S.T.

It is a federally recognized historic district since 1985 and became a City of Atlanta Landmark District in 2006. History The area in the city limits of Atlanta known today as Castleberry Hill was originally part of the renegade Snake Nation community that functioned during the 1850s. According to an article from Atlanta Magazine,\\"Who the Heck Was Juan Ponce de Leon?: The Stories behind Atlanta's Street Names,\\" Atlanta Magazine, March 2009, Vol. 48, Issue 11, p. 64 Castleberry Hill was, by the mid-nineteenth century, a red-light district filled with prostitutes, gambling, and cockfighting. By the time the Civil War began, however, this area was in the process of industrialization. Items such as terra cotta and other building materials were produced then in Atlanta factories. Additionally, Castleberry Hill then contained cotton warehousing and grocers. One of those grocers was Daniel Castleberry, for whom the area was named.Castleberry Hill History Daniel Castleberry, however, is believed to have been an established businessman in the area as a result of his winning the land in 1821 in a Georgia land lottery. By the early 1990s, the area had fallen on hard times, serving as the backdrop for dystopic films such as Freejack and Kalifornia. Loft conversions began in the 1980s, and by 1992, there were 120 lofts with 150 residents. The 1996 Olympics saw another influx of development. By the early 21st century, however, Castleberry Hill began another renaissance with major motion pictures and TV series such as Walking Dead' being filmed in the area; the now well-known Castleberry Hill Art Stroll, which is held on the second Friday of each month, has become yet another popular event in this area.\\"Downtown's Colorful Communities,\\" Atlanta Magazine, Oct. 2014, Vol. 54, Issue 6, p. 120-121 Gallery File:Castleberry Hill Atlanta.jpgThe Art Stroll File:Castleberry hill.jpgThe Art Stroll File:Castleberry hill art stroll.jpgThe Art Stroll File:Castleberry Hill lofts.jpgLofts File:Lofts castleberry hill.jpgLofts References External links * Atlanta, Georgia, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Neighborhoods in Atlanta Category:Arts districts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Atlanta ","title":"Castleberry Hill"},{"id":"5813876","text":"Mieczys≈Çaw Aszkie≈Çowicz (born January 12, 1957 in Olsztyn) is a Polish politician.

The neighborhood sprang up in the late 19th century, adjacent to several railroad lines just south of downtown. The name \\"Mechanicsville\\" comes from the \\"mechanics\\" that worked on the railway lines. It was once a vibrant multiethnic community with working class blacks and middle class whites, and home to several prominent merchant families, including the Rich family, of department store fame. Mechanicsville was established in 1870. The mural in the background displays this information from an artists work. Its decline was caused by urban renewal, migration to the suburbs, and the construction of Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium and the nearby interstate highways. The city of Atlanta has targeted the area for revitalization. The movie ATL was filmed there. Big Gee of Boyz n da Hood was born and lives there.

Located at the intersection of Classon and Lafayette Avenues on the border of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant and Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, it is served at all times by the G train.  History  This station opened on July 1, 1937, when the entire Crosstown Line was completed between Nassau Avenue and its connection to the IND Culver Line. On this date, the GG was extended in both directions to Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets and Forest Hills‚Äì71st Avenue. Under the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Plan, this station, along with 32 others, was to have undergone a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would have included cellular service, Wi- Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, and improved signage and station lighting. However, most of these renovations are being deferred until the 2020-2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding. In 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program. Station layout This underground station has two side platforms and two tracks with space for a center track. Both platforms have a light green trim line on a darker green border and name tablets reading \\"CLASSON AVE.\\" in white sans serif lettering on a dark green background and lighter green border. There are small \\"CLASSON\\" directional signs in white lettering on a black background beneath the trim line and name tablets. Dark blue i-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. The space for an additional center track between the two outer ones was meant for the unbuilt IND Second System. It would have been an extension of the center track at Bedford‚ÄìNostrand Avenues, which dead-ends on either side of that station. Railroad south of Classon Avenue, the two tracks curve closer to each other and the center trackway ends. The south end of the southbound platform and the north end of the northbound one have room for proposed control towers. Those spaces are now used for crew facilities. Exits This station has a full length mezzanine above the platforms and tracks supported by dark green i-beam columns, but only the northern half is open to the public and has two staircases to each platform. The fare control area is at the center with a turnstile bank, token booth, and three stairs going up to all corners of Classon and Lafayette Avenues except the northeast one.
