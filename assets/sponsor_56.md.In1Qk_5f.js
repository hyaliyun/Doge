Plot summary David Alder, a British property magnate educated in Australia, wants to develop a real estate site in his old home town of Snelgrove that involves knocking down an old building. At a dinner in Snelgrove he meets a couple, Ted and Diane Hardin. David dances with Diane. He then contacts an old friend he has not seen in two years, George Timmins, and explains he has been seeing Diane. David says Diane wants to meet some of his friends, and George is the only one David has. Although George has been unemployed for years, David tells Diane that George is a successful screenwriter. David and George attend a party at Ted and Diane's house which winds up as a key party. George stays the night and discovers Ted is a grocer. David, George and Diane go on holiday together at David's holiday house. David buys Diane some lingere the leaves to go back to the city. Diane and George spend the night together platonically. Ted visits David at the latter's office and says he wants advice. A property developer wants Ted to get out of the business but Ted is reluctant as his family has been there for forty years. Ted asks David for advice how to fight it and David admits his company is the developer. David advises him to take the offer saying the building will fall down in a few years and that Ted can have a lease in the new building. David invites a councillor over to his house to persuade him to compulsorily acquire Ted's lease. The councillor is reluctant but David plies him with drink and arranges for a woman to perform oral sex on the man, which David has photographer. David invites Diane to move in with him. Diane writes Ted a letter saying he is leaving. In a rage, Ted sets fire to some items. David offers George a job and the latter agrees; he offers Diane anything she wants and she asks for plastic surgery. The building is knocked down. David reveals he will make a million pounds on the deal. When a drunken George asks David if money is the answer to all things, David says \\"yes\\". David dresses up in a uniform and engages in bondage with Diane. Ted stumbles in and shoots David and Diane to death. George turns to the camera and says what happened next: Ted goes to Broadmoor Prison. The share price of the company drops but picks up when it is announced business will continue. The Sunday Times pays twelve thousand points for the rights to the story. A new building is built on the site. The end caption reads “any similarity to characters living or dead is merely evidence of our times”.

The French and their First Nations allies did a brisk trade in ransoming captives; some of the youngest captives were adopted by Mohawk families.  Historical context  In 1693 the English at Boston had entered into peace and trade negotiations with the Abenaki tribes in eastern Massachusetts. The French at Quebec under Governor Frontenac wished to disrupt the negotiations and sent Claude-Sébastien de Villieu in the fall of 1693 into present-day Maine, with orders to \\"place himself at the head of the Acadian Indians and lead them against the English.\\"John Clarence Webster, Acadia at the End of the 17th Century: Letters, Journals and Memoirs of Joseph Robineau de Villebon, Commandant in Acadia, 1690–1700, and Other Contemporary Documents, Saint John, N.B.: New Brunswick Museum, 1934/1979, pp. 56-57, at Our Roots/Nos Racines, Canada's Local Histories Online Villieu spent the winter at Fort Nashwaak. The Indian bands of the region were in general disagreement as to whether to attack the English or not, but after discussions by Villieu and the support of Father Louis-Pierre Thury and Father Vincent Bigot (at Pentagouet), they went on the offensive.  Raid  The English settlement of Oyster River was attacked by Villieu with about 250 Abenaki Indians, composed of two main groups from the Penobscot and Norridgewock under command of their sagamore Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). A number of Maliseet from Medoctec, led by Assacumbuit, took part in the attack, but Fr. Simon-Gérard had dissuaded most of his followers from participating. Following the raid on Oyster River, \\"the savages of Pentagoet under Taxous and Madockawando, piqued at the little booty, and the few captives taken,\\" took 40 warriors and marched a roundabout route to Groton, Massachusetts, which they raided on the morning of July 27, 1694.Address of C.

It is a lava spire that remains with the rest of the ridge after much of the original mountain, Háafjall, fell in a large rockslide many centuries ago.

It was announced as being in development in September 2013 and unveiled at the E3 2015. It was released on 2 February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. The game is the parallel sequel to Euro Truck Simulator 2, the spiritual successor of 18 Wheels of Steel, and the third installment in the Truck Simulator series. Set in a condensed depiction of United States, the player can drive one of a choice of American-style conventional trucks, visiting various locations across the U.S., picking up a variety of cargos, and delivering them to its destination. Since its release, the game has sold over 2 million copies on Steam.  Gameplay  American Truck Simulator is a truck driving simulator with business management elements. Players drive trailer-hooked trucks and deliver loads to a designated location in order to be compensated with money and experience points. The payload must be delivered to the destination speedily within a given amount of time, and with the least amount of damage to the goods as possible, in order to net the most money and experience points possible. In- game money, after being earned, can be used to purchase more trucks and associated aesthetic, mechanical, and structural upgrades, purchase fuel and repairs for those trucks, take out and repay loans from a bank, as well as hire drivers and purchase garages to house and base them in. The amount of money and experience points earned is commensurate on the length of the delivery in distance traveled as well as the type of goods being transported. When delivering goods, players can use their own personally-purchased truck or use one provided by an in-game company. When delivering goods using a fleet- provided truck, repairs and other costs are paid for by the company rather than out of the player's in-game fund pool. Experience points can be accumulated and used to obtain perks, which improve the player's driving ability and what kinds of payloads they can deliver, such as chemicals and explosives, which net a bigger reward when completed successfully. In addition to driving and delivering goods, the player can manage a trucking business with hired drivers and owned properties. Hired drivers will perform deliveries on their own, netting the player money. The longer the drivers are hired, the more skillful they will become, thus increasing the amount of money they earn from each delivery. The player can train each driver to focus on a specific area of their driving that can be improved upon. Unlike in Euro Truck Simulator 2, the game features weigh stations, where players must stop at a designated weight station in order to determine the weight of the cargo before proceeding through (though the game will sometimes allow them to bypass the station but avoiding it deliberately will result in receiving a fine). The game started off at launch with the U.S. states of California and Nevada, and expanded from there, with Arizona being added in June 2016 as a major update. The U.S. states of New Mexico and Oregon have been made available, as paid downloadable content (DLC), in November 2017, and October 2018, respectively. Washington was released on 11 June 2019. Utah was released on 7 November 2019, and the most recent state to be added, Idaho, was released on 16 July 2020. The U.S. state of Colorado has been announced by SCS to be coming to the game sometime in the near future. More U.S. states are expected to be added by SCS Software in the future. = Trucks = SCS Software confirmed in a blog post on 15 February 2016 that the Kenworth W900 has been launched and added to the game. SCS Software confirmed in a blog post that the Peterbilt 579 and the Kenworth T680 will ship with the sim on release day. They also confirmed the Peterbilt 389 on 3 November 2016. Two years later, SCS Software included the Volvo VNL into the game on 5 November 2018. Another three months later, the CEO of SCS Software confirmed that the International LoneStar would be coming to the game. The developer would love to include many more trucks, but has ruled out adding fictional trucks and the biggest obstacle for including real trucks remains securing licensing rights. The International LoneStar was released into the game on 12 December 2019. On 28 April 2020, the Mack Anthem was added to the game. On 30 September 2020, the Western Star 49X was added to the game.  Setting  The game is set in a condensed 1:20-scaled version of the western contiguous United States, expanded periodically by the developer through downloadable content. It currently features depictions of the western U.S. states of California, Nevada, Arizona, with New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, and Idaho available as DLCs. The game features 113 visitable cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Albuquerque, Portland, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boise and many thousands of miles worth of in-game roads. Currently, the player may travel as far north as Bellingham, Washington, as far south as Nogales, Arizona, as far west as Eureka, California, and as far east as Hobbs, New Mexico, assuming the player has all the states available to them. SCS have stated that most future map expansions, if not all, will be at additional cost. The modding community for American Truck Simulator have also created their own map extensions. These most popular of these extensions include cities in each state, Mexico, and Canada, though the majority of these maps, with some exceptions, are generally not as dense with roads as the base game nor regarded by the community as high quality or detailed. Some modded maps redo older sections of the map with their own areas, regarded as higher quality than the vanilla game. These old areas are generally considered to be out-of-date by the community, with lower design standards than SCS Software's map content today.  Development  SCS Software announced the game on 6 September 2013. It was revealed at E3 in 2015. On 11 April 2014, SCS Software announced that there will be 100+ cities in the game once completed (not initially), and SCS released screenshots of the game. Truck brands included on American Truck Simulator so far are Kenworth, Peterbilt, Volvo, International Trucks, Western Star, and Mack. More will follow; the only setback remains the licensing of trucks from their manufacturers. SCS plans to eventually include the entire contiguous United States, as long as the game continues to do well. On 26 January 2015, SCS Software published a 1-hour video to YouTube of footage from early alpha of the game. On 18 December 2015, SCS Software announced the official release date for American Truck Simulator, 3 February 2016, on their blog. The game was released 1 day earlier instead. The game was released for PC-DVD on 14 December 2017.  Reception  American Truck Simulator has received mostly positive reviews from critics, scoring 76/100 on Metacritic. James Cunningham of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, \\"While a little more realism would make American Truck Simulator more fun, paradoxical as that may sound, there’s no escaping how fantastically playable it is.\\" Laura Dale from Polygon rated the game a 8/10 saying, \\"As someone who sunk countless hours into Euro Truck Simulator 2, a fresh coat of paint, an unfamiliar set of sights and the challenge of driving on the wrong opposite side of the road left me confident that I'll be sinking just as many hours into American Truck Simulator.\\" Andy Kelly of PC Gamer commended the game and noted that it shared the strengths and shortcomings of its predecessor due to the two games' similarities, though advised that it was not finished on launch and urged more cautious gamers to wait until it was more completed before purchasing the game. American Truck Simulator won Best technological solution at the 2016 Czech Game of the Year Awards, and was also nominated for Best Game, Best PC/Console Game, and Best Audio.

Anne Heaton was born in Rawalpindi in November 1930. She studied in Birmingham from 1937 to 1943, and then with Sadler's Wells Ballet School. She made her debut in 1945 with Sadler's Wells Opera. In 1946 she joined Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet creating roles in Howard's Mardi Gras (1947) and Ashton's Valses nobles et sentimentales (1947) among others. In 1948, she moved to Sadler's Wells Ballet at Covent Garden where she became a principal. She excelled in romantic ballets like Les Sylphides in 1948, A Mirror for Witches (1952) and Giselle in 1954, but also created roles in MacMillan's The Burrow (1958) and The Invitation (1960). She resigned in 1959 due to an injury to her foot, although she made occasional guest appearances until 1962. After retirement, she taught at the Arts Educational School and also staged some ballets, including Giselle for Iranian National Ballet in 1971. She married Royal Ballet principal dancer John Field, who later became director of La Scala in Milan. She was later co-director (with her husband) of the British Ballet Organisation (now known as bbodance) from 1984 until a month before his death in 1991. Heaton died in May 2020 at the age of 89.

Founded in 1939, it is part of the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is listed in the Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register as an \\"...excellent example of an Inter-War Gothic church with Art Deco influences\\". It was the first place in Australia to install a combination organ and has the only peal of bells in the Australian Capital Territory. It was the first Anglican church to be built following the foundation of Canberra as the national capital (St John's in Reid having been consecrated in 1845) and is the first Anglican parish in South Canberra. It is situated on the corner of Canberra Avenue and Captain Cook Crescent, opposite Manuka Oval and the Manuka shops. History The parish was formed as a district of St John the Baptist Church in Reid in 1914, and a corrugated iron hall was erected on the south side of Canberra at Eastlake (later renamed Kingston) to serve the needs of the nearby workmen's camps. The hall was much used in the 1920s, and a regular congregation gathered there each Sunday with a Sunday school. In the 1930s, there was an active choir, football and cricket teams associated with the congregation. In 1933, a building fund was commenced for a permanent church on a new site. However, as that was during the Great Depression, progress was slow. A design by Sydney architects Burcham Clamp and Son was approved in 1938 and W. J. Perry, a parishioner, successfully tendered to construct it. The foundation stone for the new church was laid by the Governor-General, Baron Gowrie, on 11 December 1938. The church was dedicated on 6 August 1939, five days after the 25th anniversary of the holding of the first Anglican service in the St Paul's Hall at Kingston. It was the first Anglican church to be built in the district since the 1840s. Initially St Paul's was part of the parish of St John's; the parish of St Paul, Canberra, was proclaimed formally on 26 March 1950. Neville Chynoweth was the rector from 1971 to 1974. An organ loft was built in 1988 for Queen Elizabeth II's Australian Bicentenary visit. Architecture The church is built of red brick in a style that blends Art Deco and Gothic Revival. The original structure included only the nave but has since been enlarged twice. In 1956 a new sanctuary and unusual bell tower were added. In 2001 two more bays were added to the nave, making it the largest Anglican church in Canberra.

Geographical position  Wolbrechtshausen is located on the western end of the Leine river valley between Solling and Harz. Through the village flows the river Espolde, a tributary of the Leine. Highest point of the location is the Höheberg with a height of 177,4 m over NN. Neighbouring villages are Hevensen, Lütgenrode and Parensen.  History  The first written reference of the village is from the year 1210 in a duplication of the 13th century and calls the location as Wolbreteshusen. An older reference from the 12th century often confuses the village with the deserted site Wolbechteshusen near Gillersheim. In 1345 it is written that the house of Hardenberg owned a large manor in Wolbrechtshausen. Then in 1486 Wolbrechtshausen became a casualty of a great fire and nearly the whole village burned down. One century later in 1597 the pest raged there and so much people died that there were not enough left to cultivate the cropland. The first school in the village was built in 1709. In the 19th century Wolbrechtshausen was the home of the linen weaver. From this episode in the village witnesses an old linen weaver flag that was spent to the village for carnival and survived the time till today. Another sign of this time are the two weaver's shuttles in the coat of arms that was given to the village in 1964. Since the foundation Wolbrechtshausen was an agricultural impressed village but with the beginning of the 20th century it became more a working- class quarter for the near cities. Protestant chapel = Protestant chapel = Wolbrechtshausen is habitat of a small chapel built in the 14th century. Before it became a chapel it was a defence tower. A few centuries later the inhabitants added a nave and church windows. From the original defence tower are the wall strength from over one meter and the crenels conserved.  Economy and infrastructure  The economy of the village consists of some small business and farms = Traffic = The federal highway 446 take course on the north of Wolbrechtshausen and public traffic consists of two bus routes.

Based on the short story \\"White Hands\\" by Arthur Stringer, and written by Doris Anderson, Percy Heath, and Julian Johnson, the film is about an impulsive thrill-seeking heiress who announces to her father that she entered into a \\"companionate marriage\\" with one of her party friends. After her father abducts her aboard his private yacht and sails away, she escapes in a small boat and after a storm ends up on a desert island along with the yacht's young captain who followed after her. Half a Bride was released on June 16, 1928 by Paramount Pictures in the United States. Half a Bride received generally good reviews upon its theatrical release, with one reviewer called it \\"a clever, entertaining picture\\". Plot Patience Winslow (Esther Ralston) is an impulsive thrill-seeking heiress who spends most of her time going from one wild party to another. One night after attending several parties, she smashes her car and spends the rest of the night in jail. The following morning, she comes home and announces to her father (William Worthington) that she just entered into a trial marriage with one of her party companions, a much older man. Concerned about her well-being, her father abducts her aboard his private yacht and sets sail in order to prevent the ill-advised marriage. Angered by her father's actions and determined to escape, Patience arranges for a motor boat to be lowered to the water and she soon takes off across the waves. Captain Edmunds (Gary Cooper), the young skipper of the yacht, follows after her in another motor boat. After catching up to her, Edmunds makes a daring leap into her boat. Just then a storm engulfs the small boat and the helpless couple end up swept ashore and marooned on a desert island in the Pacific. Filled with fashionable notions she learned from popular radio dramas, Patience insists that she and Edmunds enter into a \\"companionate marriage\\" (in name only) and live together as a couple, but without the sexual entanglements. Edmunds agrees, and for three months they live out this \\"civilized\\" arrangement. Over time, however, Patience grows to love the young captain who in turn develops feelings for her. About to declare his love for her, Edmunds reconsiders because of her past actions, despite her insistence that she is no longer the spoiled thrill-seeker she once was. One day they spot a ship which comes to rescue them. After returning to civilization, the young captain wished Patience well, now that she is back among her wealthy friends. Later that night, however, as Edmunds prepares to set sail, Patience returns to him with a minister in tow. Realizing that Patience has changed and that her feelings for him are sincere, Edmunds and Patience are married.Dickens, p. 52.

The clashes were mostly concentrated around Khan Shaykhun and on the highway towards Maarrat al-Nu'man. Rebel offensive Map showing the siege of Khan Shaykhun The rebels began the operation on 5 March; three days later it was reported that the rebels were trying to cut the road between Idlib and Al-Mastuma in an attempt to surround the city of Idlib. A day after the report of the offensive the SOHR reported that a commander of an FSA battalion was assassinated by unknown gunmen between the villages of Kafar-Sejna and Al- Rekaya. Free Syrian Army units and other rebel troops charted moderate gains since the start of their operation. On 12 March, pro-opposition sources claimed the rebels cut the M-5 highway at Khan Shaykhun; 13 days later it was reported that the rebels seized 15 Syrian Army checkpoints in Khan Shaykhun after days of fighting. According to Col. Afif al-Suleimani, head of Idlib's rebel Military Council, the Army withdrew many of its soldiers from Idlib province to reinforce their forces in Latakia province after the 2014 rebel offensive at Latakia was launched against the coastal area. The rebels then advanced towards Khan Shaykhun resulted in both the lifting of the siege of the town and cutting the supply line to Syrian Army bases further north in the province. Also, on 29 March, they reportedly captured parts of the Shiite town of Al-Fu'ah, northeast of Idlib city. On 4 April, four rebels were reportedly killed by clashes around Sehyan checkpoint north of Khan Shaykhun. It was also reported that Baboulin town and al-Salhiya village were captured by the rebels, thus cutting off the supply route and highway to the Wadi Deif and Hamidiyah army bases at Maaret al-Numan. At least 18 regular soldiers were reportedly killed in the clashes and two tanks were disabled. After Baboulin was captured, clashes took place along a nearby 20-mile stretch of highway between Morek and Maaret al-Numan. A day later, the SOHR reported that the rebels seized a checkpoint at Khan Shaykhoun over night. On 8 April, rebels detonated two suicide cars at the Khazanat fueling base east of Khan Shaykhun, followed by clashes and three days later reportedly took an Army checkpoint at the crossroads of the Heish, but Syrian Army units took it back the next day. Despite this setback, the rebels captured the al-Sayyad checkpoint the same day after heavy clashes with Army units in the southeast of Khan Shaykhoun according to the SOHR. On 15 April, 21 rebels (including a defected officer and a battalion commander) and a number of Army soldiers were reportedly killed in clashes around Qmenas town. In addition, 6 rebels were killed while no less than 40 were injured, and the connection was lost with 25 rebels after an ambush by Syrian Army units around Al-Hamedya camp It was also reported that the FSA affiliated Hazzm Movement had received 20 TOW anti-tank missiles from a \\"Western source\\". On 5 May, rebels detonated a 'tunnel bomb' under the al-Sahabh checkpoint in the east of Khan Shaykhoun and captured it. According to the SOHR, about 30 pro-government fighters (including two officers) were killed in the blast. Pro-government sources denied this claim and only reported several wounded. On 14 May, the Wadi al-Deif base was struck by another 'tunnel bomb'. According to the SOHR, tens of pro-government fighters were killed and wounded by the explosion. On 24 May, according to the SOHR, rebels launched an offensive towards Hish and reportedly captured the Kafr Bassin and Hish intersection Army checkpoints. The next day, six car bombs were detonated by the rebels: Four at checkpoints in the Al Arba’in Mountain area and two at the Khazanat Army base east of Khan Shaykhoun. According to the SOHR, tens of pro-government fighters were killed and injured by the blasts in the Al Arba’in Mountain area and at least 16 in the Khazanat base. The attacks resulted in rebel advances in the Al Arba’in Mountain area and the capture of the Khazanat base. Pro-government sources denied all of this and claimed that the army was advancing in the Al Arba’in area. The following day, rebels captured the al-Salam checkpoint west of Khan Shaykhoun, thus completely securing Khan Shaykhoun and its surroundings, and a checkpoint in the Hish area. Four rebels (including a commander) were killed during the takeover of the Khazanat base on the 25th. Aftermath On 27 October, Al- Nusra stormed government positions around Idlib in an attempt to cut the supply lines to the city. Later that same day, the army recaptured all buildings and strategic points held by Al-Nusra in and near the city.

Probably built in 1793, it was a good example of 18th-century vernacular farmhouse architecture, and was one of the town's oldest buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and was destroyed by fire in 2013. Description and history The Burpee Farm farmhouse was located in a remote rural setting of southern Dublin, on the north side of Burpee Road, a dead-end lane extending up the eastern slope of Mount Monadnock to the Eveleth Farm. It was a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade was four bays wide, with an asymmetrical arrangement of three windows around an entrance that is slightly off-center. The door and windows were all set with their tops butting against the roof eave. The interior included exposed post-and-beam construction timbers, and the chimney included a beehive oven. The house was probably built by Samuel Snow, one of Dublin's early settlers, who purchased of land here in 1793 and probably built this house soon afterward. It was purchased in 1853 by Abbott Bowman Burpee, and remained in that family for over a century. The building was, despite some early 20th-century alterations, a well-preserved example of 18th century vernacular farmhouse architecture, and was one of Dublin's oldest buildings. It was purchased by the Swanson family in 1969, and was occupied by rental tenants when it was destroyed by a fire of unknown origin in 2013.

History  This metre gauge branch line between and was approved for construction by French India during December 1895. The French government invested about 1,201,840 (approximately in 2014) for the construction, which was done by the then Great South Indian Railway (which was later merged with South Indian Railway Company) and opened on 14 March 1898.  Route  With a route length of , the line had four stations Ambagarattur, Paruttikudi, Thirunallar and Karikovilpathu within a stretch of up to karaikal, all falling within the territory of French India (now Karaikal district). The rest of between Ambagarattur and Peralam falls within British India region (now Tiruvarur district).  Operations  = Passenger services = Though owned by French India, the operations were transferred to the then Great South Indian Railway in accordance with agreement signed in 1902. There were 4 up-and-down services, but due improvement in road connectivity the earnings dropped and subsequently the services were reduced to one in 1943. After Indian Independence and Railway Re-organisation, the line fell into the jurisdiction of Tiruchirappalli railway division. In 1967, citing under utilisation of the line for passenger traffic in its transport survey, the National Council for Applied and Economic Research recommended for closure of line. = Freight services = This line provided rail connectivity to Karaikal port and transfer of goods through rail into British India, as this line would give further connectivity to , which falls on the main line. Cement, fertilisers, tiles, timber, kerosene oil, rice, wheat, grains, pulses and paddy were the main goods involved in traffic. Raw materials like pressed cotton and coal for textile mills and iron billets for Pondicherry Rolling Mills were brought in, processed and the finished product was supplied all over the country. Though the goods traffic density fared better, the passenger traffic slumped and services were called off except the rolling stock.  Gauge conversion Due to persistent demand from various quarters, revival of line gained momentum for surveying the feasibility outside the purview of Railway Budget, which proposed a rough estimate of about . Officially, the line was taken up for survey as the announcement came in the 2013–2014 Railway Budget, at an outlay of and at an estimate of about for full-fledged activities. Apart from retaining the four railway stations in the past and laying broad gauge tracks in the same old path, detour lines of about is planned at and about for Tirunallar yard. In June 2019 tenders were floated for the execution of the project, expecting to complete it by March 2021.

The main entrance is on the west side, sheltered by a portico with an arched valance. In 1886, Louis Cabot, a businessman from Brookline, Massachusetts whose family manufactured Cabot Stain, purchased two farms in this area. This house was built the following year, and became the centerpiece of a gentleman farmer's estate of some . The property also included a period barn that was one of the largest ever built in Dublin.

I Pass for Human was Chris D.'s directorial debut. The film was released theatrically at the San Francisco Horror Festival on March 21, 2004 and was released to DVD in late 2006. Plot I Pass for Human follows the downward spiral of Jane (Eleanor Whitledge) following the heroin overdose and death of her boyfriend, Dax (Bryan Small). Jane soon finds herself using heroin herself to cope with the pain of mourning, as well as the shock of haunting visions of Dax following her. Finding heroin alone inadequate, in short order she replaces Dax with the company of new beau Rick (Josh Coxx). Not only is Rick a heroin addict, but he also has a dead significant other, Azami, whose jealousy apparently follows him from beyond the grave. The film plays on the conceit that heroin addicts escape death; in I Pass for Human, heroin leaves its users never quite dead, yet never quite alive. Reception I Pass for Human's independent release and distribution has left its audience limited. Reviews have been mixed. Mainstream critics, in this case from Variety Magazine and Joblo Media, were impressed by the film's special effects and acting but felt the narrative was wanting. Independent reviewers such as DVD Verdict were more supportive, declaring I Pass for Human \\"works quite nicely\\".

Beginnings In the century before the Lordship was founded, Brycheiniog had been contested between its traditional dynasty, and that of Ferlix (a realm at the heart of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren). No more of the traditional line is reported by historic manuscripts (such as those of Jesus College), beyond Tewdwr ap Griffri. The Book of Baglan reports that Bleddyn ap Maenyrch, heir of the traditional dynasty of Ferlix (who had by now lost Ferlix itself, to Elystan Glodrydd's heirs), was the King of Brycheiniog during the time of the Norman invasion of England (possibly by acquiring a claim through his mother, the niece of Tewdwr ap Griffri). Though initially neutral on the matter, the Normans acquired a dim view of Welsh princes when many of the latter supported anti-Norman revolts by the Saxons (with whom the princes were allied), such as that of Eadric the Wild. After suppressing the Saxon part of Eadric's revolt, William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford went on to defeat three prominent southern Welsh princes who had supported Eadric, including Rhys ap Tewdwr (son of Tewdwr ap Cadell), the powerful king of Deheubarth. Though Bleddyn had married Rhys' sister, the records do not mention him (or Brycheiniog) being involved. Deheubarth had also been a contested realm over the previous century, in this case between the heirs of Maredudd ab Owain's daughter Angharad (such as Gruffydd ap Llywelyn), those of his brother Einion (such as Rhys ap Tewdwr), and the rulers of Morgannwg. In 1088, Gruffydd's son-in-law, and his son-in-law's son-in-law, Bernard de Neufmarché, took part in a rebellion against King William Rufus, without being punished for it. Emboldened by this, Bernard launched attacks on an area under Rhys' influence - Brycheiniog - while the sons of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Gruffydd's half-brother, attacked Deheubarth; this was likely a co-ordinated action between Bernard and Bleddyn ap Cynfyn's sons.Dr. K. L. Maund, Ireland, Wales, and England in the Eleventh Century, 1991, page 149 Bleddyn ap Maenyrch was defeated at the Battle of Caer-Bannau (one of Bleddyn ap Maenyrch's castles, and a former Roman army camp), while Rhys was forced to flee to Ireland. Rhys later re-established his position with Irish assistance, and in April 1093 he and Bleddyn attacked Bernard while he was building a castle at Brecon. The attack failed, and both Rhys and Bleddyn ap Maenyrch were killed. The Welsh Annales clearly state that Rhys was killed 'by the French who were inhabiting Brycheiniog' (implying that Bernard had already taken over the kingdom). Bernard established a Marcher Lordship in its place - the Lordship of Brecknock (the name being a Norman mangling of Brycheiniog). Bernard confined Bleddyn ap Maenyrch's eldest son, Gwrgan, in Brecon Castle (though Gwrgan was allowed to travel elsewhere, if accompanied by Bernard's knights); nevertheless, Bernard gave Gwrgan, and his brothers, some lands within Bernard's Lordship, to sustain their dignityBrecknock in S.Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, London, 1849 online version (Gwgan initially receiving Cathedine). Bernard was succeeded by his son, Mahel. However, Bernard's wife, Nesta, dramatically swore an oath, in the presence of King Henry I, that Mahel was a bastard. Henry consequently ruled that the inheritance should be transferred to Sibyl, Bernard's daughter, who just happened to be married to Miles Fitz-Walter, a friend of Henry. Role in the revolt of 1136 When Stephen de Blois broke his oath by displacing his cousin, Empress Matilda, from succeeding her father (Henry I) to the English throne, the conflict it caused eroded central authority in England,Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Great Revolt, beginnings Gwenllian pg 80, taking Ceredigion, restores Welsh monks, Battle of Crug Mawr, 82-85 to such an extent that a state of anarchy broke out. By the following year - 1136 - a number of Welsh princes and magnates had begun to see this as an opportunity to recover lands they had lost to Marcher lords,Davies, John, A History of Wales, the Anarchy, Norman vulnerability in Wales, extends borders, Oswestry annexed, capture of Rhuddlan, Ystrad Alun, Ial, Tegeingl, 124 and broke out in revolt. The revolt began when Hywel ap Maredudd, a minor lord in the west of the Lordship of Brecknock,John Edward Lloyd, A history of Wales from the Earlist Times to the Edwardian conquest, 1911, volume 2, page 470 recruited an army and marched to the adjacent Lordship of Gower, defeating the Norman and English colonists there in the Battle of Llwchwr. Inspired by Hywel's success, Gruffydd ap Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, hastened to meet with Gruffydd I of Gwynedd, his father-in-law, to enlist his aid. However, the opportunities presented by the anarchy worked both ways - the absence of Gruffydd ap Rhys from Deheubarth enabled Marcher lords to encroach further into Deheubarth.Warner, Philip \\"Famous Welsh Battles, Gwenllian pg 69, 79 To resist the encroachment, Gruffydd ap Rhys' wife Gwenllian, Princess of Deheubarth (and Gwynedd), gathered an host; Gwenllian's forces, however, were defeated, with Gwenllian and two of her sons being killed in the battle. Gwenllian's attempted defence nevertheless inspired further opposition to the Marcher Lords, ultimately leaving her son, Rhys ap Gruffydd as a much more powerful ruler than his parents had been. When Matilda and Stephen's differences were settled, and Matilda's son Henry II came to the throne, the renewed strength of central authority enabled Henry to push back Welsh princes to their pre- anarchy borders. The Lordship of Brecknock remained intact, and Sibyl's husband, Miles, remained its Lord. Sibyl's progeny Sibyl's sister-in-law was married to Richard Fitz Pons, a powerful supporter of Bernard, who owned lands in Herefordshire close to the border of Brycheiniog (as well as elsewhere) - the Barony of Clifford. Bernard had assigned some of the land on the Brycheiniog side of the border with Clifford to Richard (as a barony within the Lordship of Brecknock); Richard built a castle there - Bronllys Castle. Bernard had similarly assigned a region in the north eastern corner of Brycheiniog to Philip Walwyn, who similarly built a castle - Hay Castle. Subsequently, Hay Castle, and its surrounding land, was completely detached from the Lordship and given as a dowry to Sibyl's daughter Bertha, when she married William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, who already possessed the adjacent Lordship of Buellt. Years later, when Sibyl died, the rest of the Lordship of Brecknock was inherited by her son, Roger. However, Roger, who was childless, detached the region around Bronllys, the whole of the Cantref Selyf, and gave it as an independent Lordship to his cousin, Walter Fitz- Richard, the son of Richard Fitz-Pons. Roger remained childless, so the remainder of the Lordship of Brecknock was inherited by each of his brothers in turn, all of them (Walter, Henry, Mahel, and William) dying childless. William, the last of these died while at Bronllys, when the castle caught fire, and a falling stone killed him. The lands held by William (which were more extensive than just the Lordship of Brecknock) were divided between his sisters; Bertha received Brecknock, which was consequently joined with her husband's Lordship of Buellt (and Hay re-attached to it).  The de Braose inheritance  The lands of Bertha and her husband were inherited by their eldest son, William, who fell out with King John in a spectacular manner, consequently being forced into exile (where he died in penury), while his wife and eldest son were deliberately starved to death. In 1208, John seized William's paternal inheritance, and detached the eastern cantref of the Brecknock Lordship, erecting it into a new and distinct Marcher Lordship - the Lordship of Blaenllynfi (also known after its most significant town, Talgarth) - giving the latter to Peter FitzHerbert (the son of Bertha's co-heir, and sister, Lucy). When King John's son, Henry III, acceded to the throne, he was keen to make peace with the barons after the problems his father had encountered. Henry restored William's paternal inheritance, and the surviving Lordship of Brecknock (i.e. without Blaenllynfi), to the Braose family, specifically Reginald de Braose, William's younger brother. Reginald's lands were inherited by his son, who unfortunately was survived only by daughters, so the lands were divided between them: *Eva received the Lordship of Abergavenny; she married a minor noble *Maud received the Lordship of Radnor; her husband was Roger Mortimer (who, like his ancestors, had designs on the adjacent realm of Maelienydd) *Isabella received the Lordship of Buellt, and subsequently married Dafydd ap Llywelyn (son of Llywelyn Fawr, the ruling prince of Gwynedd) *Eleanor received the Lordship of Brecknock; her husband was Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford  Disputed Land  = Mortimer = Mortimer was, however, aggrieved at the paucity of his reward, noting that the lands were not the same size, and feeling the division should have been more equal. Over the next 25 years, Mortimer, a major ally of king Henry III at a time when the King was facing opposition from many of his other Barons, managed to get the settlement re-adjusted, so that he would be officially allocated parts of the Lordship of Brecknock. The de Bohuns, however, stalled the hand-over. Meanwhile, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, nephew of Daffyd ap Llywelyn, and new ruling prince of Gwynedd, had taken advantage of the king's weakness to expand his own territory, eventually conquering the Lordships of Radnor and Brecknock, having already seized Buellt. In 1263, the king's son, Edward, launched a successful counter-attack, defeating Llywelyn; Edward the whole Lordship of Brecknock to Mortimer (the king's ally) not de Bohun (an opponent of the king). Two months later, the Second Barons' War broke out; Mortimer and de Bohun were on opposing sides. In 1266, Mortimer's army was near- obliterated, but later that year the War was all-but-ended in the king's favour. Mortimer brokered a peace with de Bohun, surrendering the Lordship of Brecknock to him. = Llywelyn (again) = During the Second Baron's War, Llywelyn had become an ally of Simon de Montfor, the king's arch-enemy, when Simon offered to restore Llywelyn to the territorial gains he had previously been forced to relinquish by Edward. This had been formalised in the Treaty of Pipton. Llywelyn used this, and Mortimer's weakness, to re-expand Gwyneddian power, meaning that de Bohun, despite Mortimer's reluctant consent, still wasn't able to enjoy the Lordship of Brecknock. Though Simon's actions were treason, the King saw, following the War, that they presented a way to remove a potential source of further opposition; with a population fatigued of war, and many Barons who had previously opposed the King, stability was the important thing. The king and Llywelyn agreed the Treaty of Montgomery, by which - though nominally now a vassal of the king, Llywelyn received the Lordship of Brecknock. However, a decade later, after Henry had been succeeded by his son (Edward), Llywelyn married de Montfort's daughter, Eleanor, so Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel, and attacked Gwynedd. In 1277 Llywelyn was forced to agree the Treaty of Aberconwy, which limited Llywelyn's authority to Gwynedd alone. De Bohun was finally Lord of Brecknock. = de Clare = Towards the end of his life, in 1291, Humphrey fell into dispute with Gilbert de Clare about the border between their lands. Humphrey as well as being Lord of Brecknock was Earl of Hereford, while Gilbert was Lord of Glamorgan and Earl of Gloucester. In order to prevent War (as Marcher Lords they had the right to War with each other, in their Marcher Lordships), Edward (now king) insisted that the matter should be brought before his court before any further action was taken. Unfortunately, Gilbert's tenants then took it upon themselves to act, stealing cattle from those of Humphrey, so Humphrey's tenants counter-attacked. The king was extremely angered by this, and ordered that the Lordships of Brecknock and Glamorgan be forfeit. Subsequently, Humphrey and Gilbert settled their differences and persuaded the king to commute the decision in return for large sums of cash.  Edward II & Hugh Despencer  When King Edward II began his rule, the childless John Fitz- Reginald, heir of Peter Fitz-Herbert, granted the reversion of all his lands (including the Lordship of Blaenllynfi) to the king.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem: Volume 7, Edward III, File 14, entry 177 In 1309 the king issued a charter, granting them to Rhys ap Hywel, descendant and heir of Gwgan, in gratitude of Philip's loyalty to Edward's father; Fitz-Reginald had already given Philip baronial rights to a manor within the Lordship. The Bronllys Lordship was at this time held by Walter Fitz-Richard's heir, Maud, daughter of John Giffard, 1st Baron Giffard. When she died, in 1311, without immediate heirs, King Edward transferred the Bronllys Lordship to Rhys ap Hywel as well. Humphrey de Bohun was succeeded by his son, Humphrey, one of the ardent opponents of King Edward II's boyfriend, Piers Gaveston, and then of his subsequent boyfriend, Hugh Despenser. While in revolt against the latter at the Battle of Boroughbridge, Humphrey was killed, so Edward declared Humphrey's lands forfeit and gave them (including the Lordship of Brecknock) to Hugh. Rhys had similarly rebelled, so again Edward seized Rhys' lands and gave them to Hugh, re-uniting the whole Lordship of Brecknock. The leader of the revolt (other than Humphrey) was Roger Mortimer, who had been renting Buellt from Queen Isabella (Isabella having received it from Edward). Since the Queen herself was a supporter of the revolt, regarding Hugh Despencer as having destroyed her marriage to Edward, the King naturally seized Buellt too, and added it to Hugh's Lordship. Five years later, in 1326, Roger and Isabella (now Roger's lover), having fled to the continuent in the interim, returned and launched a coup against Edward and Hugh. According to the annals of Newenham Abbey, the king and his husband fled to Wales.Shopland, Norena 'The man with the upside-down arms' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales Seren Books (2017) They were caught there by a search party, containing Rhys ap Hywel, ultimately leading to their deaths. Roger Mortimer, now in effective control of the country (ostensibly on behalf of Edward's son, but in reality for his own benefit), restored the status quo ante as best he could; Rhys ap Hywel was restored to his portion of the Lordship of Brecknock, while Humphrey's son, John de Bohun received the rest.  Later De Bohun lords  John was succeeded by his brother, Humphrey, while Rhys was succeeded by his son, Philip ap Rhys. However, King Edward III, after taking control of government from Roger Mortimer (whom he had executed for treason), allowed himself to be persuaded that a place like the Lordship of Brecknock should be ruled by a powerful magnate (like Humphrey) not a weak one (like Philip). Edward consequently transferred Philip's portion of the Lordship to Humphrey, re-uniting the Lordship once again; Philip was compensated with a manor in Shropshire (Shifnal). Humphrey's son, Humphrey, succeeded him in turn. This Humphrey only had daughters so the land then went into abeyance. However, Humphrey's younger daughter, Mary, had married Henry Bolinbroke, who by now had usurped the throne, as Henry IV; Henry used his (usurped) authority and terminated the abeyance in Mary's favour - effectively transferring the lands to himself (by jure uxoris). Nevertheless, Anne of Gloucester, daughter of Mary de Bohun's elder sister Eleanor, petitioned Henry for her grandfathers lands - which should rightly be hers - to be returned to her. The Lordship of Brecknock was then ruled by Anne's descendants, the Earls of Buckingham. When her great-great-grandson, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was executed for treason, having been suspected of plotting against King Henry VIII, the Lordship was forfeited to the crown, and re-combined it with Buellt (which the crown still possessed, and had stopped renting out to Mortimer's heirs when the latter merged with the crown), as it had been last time it was a crown possession. By his Laws in Wales Acts, Henry converted the combined territory - the Lordships of Brecknock and Buellt - into Brecknockshire, subject to standard English law.

Excavations and research have revealed the remains of an Iron Age village of the ancient Kingdom of Ammon. A two-storey house of the early Islamic period was also found, providing insight of the seventh to eighth century transition from Christianity to Islam in Central Transjordan. Today Tall Jawa stands as a tell — a mound of ruins — overlooking the Madaba Plain. Amongst local people, it is known as 'the Rock' but the ancient name of the settlement is not known. Location Tall Jawa stands at an elevation of above sea level, close to the Iron Age capital city of Rabbath-Ammon. It is located west-northwest of the modern city of Jawa, south of modern Amman. History Tall Jawa was known to nineteenth-century travellers and explorers. Nelson Glueck conducted the first archaeological survey on site in 1933 and modern day excavations commenced in 1989. No other research is known to have taken place between Glueck's survey and the start of modern excavations. Tall Jawa underwent 6 seasons of research and excavations, first as part of the Madaba Plains Project and, after 1992, as the Tall Jawa excavation Project. Lawrence T. Geraty (Project Director, Madaba Plains Project) was in charge of the excavations in 1989 and 1991 and Michèle Daviau oversaw them from 1992 to 1995. Archaeological finds, including architecture and artefacts dating from the Iron Age (1100–600 BC), have revealed information about the Kingdom of Ammon. Some of the artefacts found on site have been retained by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan for the National Museum in Amman. The remaining objects are either at Wilfrid Laurier University or in storage at the American Center for Oriental Research in Amman. Archaeological research has revealed that the site was reoccupied 1200 years after the destruction of the Iron Age town, during the transition from the Byzantine to the Umayyad period. Archaeological finds Aspect of the Tall Jawa archaeological site in Jordan Excavations and research in 1989, 1991 and 1992–95, uncovered Iron Age settlements at Tall Jawa dating from 1100 to 600 BC. The earliest settlement on site dates back to the Iron Age I period (1100-900 BC). After the destruction of the Iron Age I village, excavations revealed the existence of a fortification wall and a multi-chambered gate dating to mid-late Iron Age II. The majority of the ceramic material found date primarily to Iron Age II, putting the site within the range of Iron Age II residential towns. Items excavated include artefacts of daily life such as flasks, jars and ground stone tools, jewellery, figurative objects, coins, seals and even marine shells. The presence of pottery sherds from the Byzantine period suggested the reoccupation of the site during the Late Antique period. Building 600, a two-storey house, was used in the Early Islamic Period and abandoned thereafter. Pottery, mould-made lamps, glass, a small coin hoard and mosaic pavements were amongst the artefacts and architectural elements found in or near the building. Research on this building and the material culture attached to it has made a contribution to our understanding and knowledge of village life during and after the Islamic conquests in Central Transjordan, as well as the overall seventh to eighth century Christian–Islamic transition. The zenith of Tall Jawa can be traced to during the period of the Assyrian Empire, according to evidence of ceramic artefacts that are more advanced and of higher status compared to others at the site.

Dismayed by the deposition of his fellow exponent of the School of Antioch, Nestorius, precipitated by Cyril of Alexandria's vigorous objection to the Christotokos (instead of Theotokos) expression which Nestorius used, Eutherius writes a lively text of protest, which in turn brings about his own deposition and exile, initially at Scythopolis in Palestine. John of Antioch, in the Act of Union of 433, reconciled with Cyril and pursued a policy of abandoning some of the positions he had once held and repression of those who continued to express them. His successor and nephew, Domnus II of Antioch, however, advocated conciliation, and Eutherius was able to escape from Scythopolis and take refuge with Irenaeus, the new bishop of Tyre (who as a senior civil servant (comes) had been involved at a key level in the organisation of the Ephesus council and as go-between for the delegations and Emperor Theodosius II, and whose pro-oriental sympathies had led to a term of exile in Petra). The text of the Protest appears to have survived largely through attribution to Athanasius of Alexandria. In the way of attestation Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople in his Bibliotheca is closer to the mark in ascribing it to Theodoret. Euthymios Zigabenos cites without naming an author, but Severus of Antioch in his Contra Impium Grammaticum quotes from with attribution to Eutherius of Tyana. (Both the latter authors are referring to chapter 20, which together with 21 may well constitute a slightly later addition by Eutherius to his original text). The Protest (Antilogia) against those who advocate a suffering God (Theopaschism) is written in a clear and vigorous style using various rhetorical devices (formulae, punch-lines, diatribe, metaphor - e.g.,in chapter 20, reaching a safe harbour after the risk of piracy) and attempting to expose the absurdity of his Alexandrian school opponents' arguments. He uses the terminology derived from Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorios, e.g. sunapheia. Minor incoherences (e.g.in referencing scriptural quotations) do not essentially compromise the high quality of his expression. Coherence, or rather the incoherence of the opposition's reasoning, is a recurring theme. Such qualities ensure that this work is no ordinary pamphlet. Eutherius' attitude to the Jews is interesting: like John Chrysostom, he rejects Judaism and he reproaches Jews for failing to discern the signs of divinity performed by Christ, but this very ignorance clears them of the charge of deicide, and in any case, he states that Christ has pronounced forgiveness. Eutherius' other surviving work consists of five letters preserved in Latin in the Collectio Casinensis (Letters 162, 163, 204, 205, 291), 4 addressed to fellow Antiochene theologian bishops, John of Antioch, Helladius of Tarsus, Alexander of Hierapolis together with Theodoret of Cyrrhus, Alexander of Hierapolis individually, and one to Pope Sixtus III in Rome.

Initially assigned to the North Sea, she was transferred to lead the 12th Minesweeping Flotilla. The Flotilla were posted to the Mediterranean to assist with Operation Torch. In 1942, after a successful mine clearing operation off Bougie, she was torpedoed by the , causing Algerine to sink, leaving only eight survivors.  Description  Algerine displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which gave a maximum speed of . The ship mounted one single 4-inch (102 mm) Mk V gun. Algerine had four single mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, and she was fitted with two depth charge rails, and four depth charge throwers.  Career  Algerine was laid down on 15 March 1941, by Harland & Wolff, Belfast, and launched on 22 December 1941. She was the eighth ship of the Royal Navy to be named . After being completed, the ship was commissioned on 24 March 1942, and adopted by Sittingbourne due to a Warship Week campaign. Algerine joined the 9th Minesweeping Flotilla in May 1942 and began action in minesweeping, escorting, and patrolling duties on the east side of England. She was proposed as leader for the 12th Minesweeping Flotilla, which would participate in action abroad. Her sister ships from the 9th Flotilla, and , joined her, as did , and . In October, she was put forward to go to the Mediterranean to assist Operation Torch, but her departure was delayed due to repair work. The other four ships in her flotilla left for Gibraltar as escorts to a convoy. Four days after the other ships left, Algerine escorted convoy KMF1 to Oran. Fate In early November, she helped recover the escort destroyer off Algiers after Cowdray was damaged by an aerial attack. On 15 November, Algerine and Alarm were positioned off Bougie, clearing mines. The mission had been successful, with 46 mines cleared; but, Algerine was torpedoed by the Italian , commanded by Lieutenant commander Rino Erler. The submarine had first fired two torpedoes at the middle ship in the trio, then fired another two torpedoes at the last ship, Algerine: Algerine suffered heavy casualties and sank. The converted merchant vessel rescued 32 men, of whom only 8 survived, internal wounds killing 24. The survivors had been on a Carley raft. The final death toll was 84. Algerines wreck lies at on the northern coast of Algeria.

Fellow students at Ridley College (Melbourne) found him deep and spiritual with a good sense of humour. Ordained ministry Mdimi Mhogolo was Principal of St. Philip’s College, Kongwa in the 1980s where he worked with New Zealand Church Missionary Society (NZCMS) missionaries. Mdimi Mhogolo was ordained a bishop in 1989 for the Anglican Diocese of Central Tanganyika, in Tanzania, a huge diocese. As a connection between Ridley College (Melbourne) and Tanzania where Mdimi Mhogolo came from, Rt Rev Alfred Stanway was an Australian who in 1950 was appointed Bishop of Central Tanganyika by the Archbishop of Canterbury before Mdimi Mhogolo. Alfred Stanway was later administrator at Ridley College (Melbourne) under Leon Morris and one residential hall at Ridley College (Melbourne) was named Stanway in honour of him.

Anne Makinda, speaker of the Tanzanian National Assembly, \\"said the late Bishop Mhogolo was the friend of everyone and that his death was a big shock.\\" Views on homosexuality Mhogolo was a moderate on the issue of homosexuality compared to many African Anglicans who strongly condemned homosexuality or even denied its existence in Africa; he sought to avoid a schism in the church over the issue. In 2007 he wrote that homosexuality as an issue \\"is not fundamental to the Christian faith, although many try to make it that way\\".

Other than these 5-year sample studies, India has – except since 2017 – never routinely collected monthly, quarterly or yearly nationwide employment and unemployment statistics. In 2016, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy – a non-government entity based in Mumbai, started sampling and publishing monthly unemployment in India statistics.  Methodology and survey frequency  =NSSO surveys= The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has been the key governmental agency in India at the national and state levels to study employment, unemployment and unemployment rates through sample surveys. It does not report employment or unemployment results every quarter nor every year, but generally only once every 5 years. The last three officially released NSSO survey and report on employment and unemployment were completed in 2004–2005, in 2009–2010, and 2011–2012. The 2011-2012 survey was initiated by the Congress-led Manmohan Singh's government because it was felt that the higher unemployment numbers in the 2009-2010 report may have been affected by poor monsoons, and an early survey might yield more accurate and better data. There was no NSSO survey between 2012 and 2017, and a new survey was initiated in 2017–2018. This report has not been officially released by the BJP-led Narendra Modi's government, but the report has been leaked to the media.The jobs data mystery: Understanding India's big crisis in a fraught poll season, The Economic Times (10 April 2019) According to ILO, the NSSO surveys are India's most comprehensive as they cover small villages in remote corners and islands of India. However, this survey uses unconventional and India-specific terminology. It estimates the activity status of a person by different approaches i.e. \\"usual status\\" unemployment and \\"current status\\" unemployment. These estimates yield various forms of unemployment numbers, according to an ILO report, and the totals vary based on, factors such as whether a person has, for pay or no pay, \\"worked at least for 30 days during the reference period of 365\\", \\"worked for at least 1 hour on any day during the 7 days preceding the date of survey\\", and an estimate for \\"person-hours worked in the reference week\\" according to its statistical methods\\". From its sample survey, it estimates a wide range of employment and unemployment statistics, along with the total population of the nation, gender distribution, and a host of other data. The NSSO methodology has been controversial, praised for its scope and effort, also criticized for its \\"absurd\\" results and inconsistencies.A Statistical Embarrassment, Surjit Bhalla, The Indian Express (April 13, 2019) =Labour bureau reports= The Indian Labour Bureau, in addition to the NSSO surveys, has published indirect annual compilations of unemployment data by each state government's labour department reports, those derived from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), Occupational Wage Surveys, and Working Class Family Income and Expenditure Surveys and other regular and ad-hoc field surveys and studies on India published by third parties. =CMIE reports= According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Private Limited,https://www.cmie.com/ India has never tracked and published monthly, quarterly or yearly employment and unemployment data for its people. This may have been a political convenience, states Mahesh Vyas, as \\"no measurements means there are no [political] arguments\\" about unemployment in India. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a non-government private entity, started to survey and publish monthly unemployment data for the first time in Indian history in 2016. Its data collection methodology and reports differ from those published by the NSSO.NYAY works against jobs, Mahesh Vyas, Business Standard (1 April 2019); for its methodology see Unemployment, CMIE, Mumbai (2019) =ILO reports= The United Nations International Labour Organization has published its statistics for unemployment in India, along with other nations, based on the international standards it has adopted. In 2017, ILO updated its methodologies to make the labour force, employment and unemployment trends measurement more accurate and more consistent across countries. According to the ILO's 2018 World Employment of Social Outlook report, it adopted revisions and measures for all countries so as to \\"encompass the inclusion of additional data points (e.g. new or updated data for countries), removal of inconsistent data entries and revisions stemming from the application of the internationally agreed criteria in the computation of unemployment rates in countries where nation- specific, relaxed definitions of unemployment were previously reported. These changes account for 85 per cent of the downward revision to global unemployment figures\\". In 2017, the ILO adopted changes to its overall population data estimates as well, for each country including India. The ILO uses a complex and diverse set of population demographics, sample surveys and economic activity indicators to derive its estimates.World Employment Social Outlook 2018, ILO United Nations, Geneva, pages 5-7, 40-41, 56-58 =Transition to periodic measurements= In 2017, according to The Economic Times, the government announced that the \\"employment data collection in India will soon undergo a major revamp\\", after a high-level expert panel recommended an end to the five-year employment surveys by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). The panel led by Niti Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended that it be replaced with an annual or more frequent and reliable data collection and reports.NSSO survey faces an end, panel to opt for a more robust tool, The Economic Times (7 July 2017)Govt to conduct annual job survey, labour bureau study not realistic: Panagariya, The Hindustan Times (6 June 2017) According to this panel, the NSSO methodology and practices have yielded misleading and biased data that \\"do not include the self-employed and farm workers, and are marred by low or irregular frequency and long-time lags\\". Statistics  Unemployment and under-employment have been a long- standing problem in the Indian economy. According to a 2013 report by Pravin Sinha, the Indian labor force has been officially classified by the Indian government into three categories:Combating Youth Unemployment in India, Pravin Sinha (March 2013), Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Berlin, Germany *Rural sector, which includes the farm labour *Urban formal sector, which includes factory and service industry labour with periodic salaries and coverage per Indian labor laws *Urban informal sector, which includes self-employment and casual wage workers The rural and informal sectors of the Indian labour market accounted for 93% of the employment in 2011, and these jobs were not covered by the then existing Indian labour laws. According to the 2010 World Bank report, \\"low-paying, relatively unproductive, informal sector jobs continue to dominate the [Indian] labor market.\\"World Bank (2010), India’s Employment Challenge – Creating Jobs, Helping Workers, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , page 3 \\"The informal sector dominates India’s labour markets and will continue to do so in the medium term\\", states the World Bank, and even if the definition of the \\"formal sector is stretched to include all regular and salaried workers, some 335 million workers were employed in the informal sector in 2004–5\\".World Bank (2010), India’s Employment Challenge – Creating Jobs, Helping Workers, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , page 8 =1980s to 2015= According to the Indian government's official statistics between the 1980s and mid 2010s, relying in part on the NSSO data, the unemployment rate in India has been about 2.8 percent, which states the World Bank, is \\"a number that has shown little variation since 1983\\". In absolute terms, according to the various Indian governments between 1983 and 2005, the number of unemployed persons in India steadily increased from around 7.8 million in 1983 to 12.3 million in 2004–5. According to the World Bank, these official Indian government \\"low open unemployment rates can often be misleading\\" and the official data does not reflect the unemployment and under-employment reality of the Indian population.a World Bank (2010), India’s Employment Challenge – Creating Jobs, Helping Workers, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , page 41-43 For decades, the Indian governments have used unusual terminology and definitions for who it considers as \\"unemployed\\". For example, \\"only those people are considered unemployed who spent more than six months of the year looking for or being available for work\\" and have not worked at all in the formal or the informal sector over that period. Alternate measures such as the current weekly or daily status unemployment definition are somewhat better. Using the current daily status definition, the unemployment rate in India had increased from \\"7.3 percent in 1999–2000 to 8.3 percent in 2004–5\\", states the World Bank report. However, these \\"better\\" official definitions and consequent NSSO data too have been a source of \\"unending controversy\\" since the 1950s, states Raj Krishna. In 1958–59, the Indian government began defining a current status employed as any person if \\"he was gainfully occupied [for wage or no wage] on at least one day\\", during the reference week [reference period] \\"regardless of the hours of work\\" he might have put in on that \\"gainfully occupied\\" day [or days]. A person was counted as \\"current status unemployed\\", since 1958 according to this official method, if he was not at all \\"gainfully occupied in that reference week and was available for work for at least one day in that reference period\\". Jobless economic growth According to Kannan and Raveendran, \\"there is unanimity amongst scholars that the organised manufacturing sector [in India] registered “jobless growth” during 1980-81 to 1990-91; while the average annual rate of growth of gross value added during this period was about 8.66%, the corresponding average annual employment growth was merely 0.53%.\\" After the deregulation of the Indian economy in the early 1990s, four years saw a boom in formal sector employment. Thereafter, the Indian economy has seen high GDP growth without a parallel increase in formal employment in the organized sector. This stagnation in formal sector employment, they state, has been attributed by some scholars to labor laws and regulations adopted since the 1950s that make inflexible labor market conditions and economic risks associated with offering formal sector employment. Other scholars contest that this hypothesis fully explains the unemployment and under-employment trends in India between 1981–82 and 2004–2005. According to Rubina Verma, while the Indian economy has been shifting from being predominantly agriculture employment-based to one where the employment is a mix of agriculture, manufacturing and services, the economy has largely seen a \\"jobless growth\\" between the 1980s and 2007. This jobless growth in the Indian manufacturing has been puzzling, states Sonia Bhalotra, and is in part linked to the productivity growth. The major industries that have seen growth in formal employment have been export-oriented manufacturing, software, and local services. However, states Ajit Ghose, the services-based industry has not been \\"particularly employment-intensive\\", and its rapid growth has not addressed the unemployment and under-employment problems in India – and the job needs of its growing population – between 1983 and 2010. According to Soumyatanu Mukherjee, even though the formal organized sector of the Indian economy grew rapidly in the 2000s, it did not create jobs and the growth was largely through capital intensive investments and labor productivity gains. The organised sector employment, states Mukherjee, actually \\"reduced dramatically between 2004~2005 and 2009–2010\\", especially when compared to 1999–2004 period if the NSSO reports for these periods were accurate. =2018-2019 reports= According to the Pew Research Center, a significant majority of Indians consider the lack of employment opportunities as a \\"very big problem\\" in their country. \\"About 18.6 million Indians were jobless and another 393.7 million work in poor-quality jobs vulnerable to displacement\\", states the Pew report.A Sampling of Public Opinion in India: Optimism persists, but concerns about terrorism and Pakistan loom large, 2019 polls, Kat Devlin; Survey Results Kat Devlin and Courtney Johnson, Pew Research Center, Washington DC (25 March 2019) Leaked NSSO report A report on unemployment prepared by the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO's) periodic labour force survey, has not been officially released by the government. According to Business Today, this report is the \\"first comprehensive survey on employment conducted by a government agency after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation move in November 2016\\". According to this report, the 2017–2018 \\"usual status\\" unemployment rate in India at 6.1%, a four-decade high, possibly caused by the 2016 demonetisation of large banknotes intended to curb the informal untaxed economy. The report and the refusal of the BJP government to release the latest NSSO report has been criticized. According to Surjit Bhalla, the BJP government's holding the report back is a bad political decision, the survey methodology is flawed and its results absurd, because the sample survey-based report finds that India's overall population has declined since 2011–12 by 1.2% (contrary to the Census data which states a 6.7% increase). The report finds that India's percent urbanization and urban workforce has declined since 2012, which is contrary to all other studies on Indian urbanization trends, states Bhalla. According to NSSO's report's data, \\"the Modi government has unleashed the most inclusive growth anywhere, and at any time in human history\\" – which is as unbelievable as the unemployment data it reports, states Bhalla. The NSSO report suggests the inflation-adjusted employment income of casual workers has dramatically increased while those of the salaried wage-earners has fallen during the 5-years of BJP government. The NSSO has also changed the sampling methodology in the latest round, state Bhalla and Avik Sarkar,Unemployment in India: The real reason behind low employment numbers, Financial Express, Avik Sarkar (28 February 2019) which is one of the likely sources of its flawed statistics and conclusions. The report states that male youth had an unemployment rate of 17.4 percent and 18.7 percent in rural and urban areas, while women youth had rates of 13.6 percent and 27.2 percent respectively in 2017-18. However, the think tank of Government of India, NITI Aayog says that these are not official and the data is not yet verified. The Indian labor force is estimated to be growing by 8 million per annum, but the Indian economy is currently not producing new full- time jobs at this rate. The BJP-led Indian government has claimed that the NSSO report was not final. ILO estimates According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) – a United Nations agency, unemployment is rising in India and the \\"unemployment rate in the country [India] will stand at 3.5 percent in 2018 and 2019 – the same level of unemployment seen in 2017 and 2016\\", instead of dropping to 3.4 percent as it had previously projected.(a) More joblessness: ILO sees India's unemployment rate rising to 3.5% in 2018, Business Standard, Somesh Jha (24 January 2019); (b) Full Report: World Employment Social Outlook Report, International Labour Organization (2019), , pages 108-109, Appendix D and Southern Asia section According to the ILO's World Employment Social Outlook Report, the unemployment rate in India has been in the 3.4% to 3.6% range over the Indian- government led 2009–2014 and the government led 2014–2019 periods.  Causes of Unemployment in India  According to Alakh Sharma, the causes of high unemployment and under-employment in India are subject of intense debate among scholars. A group of scholars state that it is a consequence of \\"restrictive labor laws that create inflexibility in the labor market\\", while organized labor unions and another group of scholars contest this proposed rationale. India has about 250 labor regulations at central and state levels, and global manufacturing companies find the Indian labor laws to be excessively complex and restrictive compared to China and other economies that encourage manufacturing jobs, according to the economist Pravakar Sahoo.No easy task for India’s labour reforms, East Asia Economic Forum, Pravakar Sahoo (12 November 2014) According to Sharma, the Indian labor laws are \\"so numerous, complex and even ambiguous\\" that they prevent a pro-employment economic environment and smooth industrial relations. India needs \\"labour market reforms that address the needs of both employers and workers\\", and it should rewrite its labor laws that protects its workers, provides social security for workers between jobs, and makes compliance easier for the industry. According to The Economist the Indian labor laws are inflexible and restrictive, and this in combination with its poor infrastructure is a cause of its unemployment situation.How India got its funk, The Economist (22 August 2013) Unemployment is a major social issue in India. As of September 2018, according to the Indian government, India had 31 million jobless people. The numbers are widely disputed.The uses of digital manufacturing and machinery in factories and garments are leading to unemployment in India. Government policies  =Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005= The Government of India has taken several steps to decrease the unemployment rates like launching the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme which guarantees a 100-day employment to an unemployed person in a year. It has implemented it in 200 of the districts and further will be expanded to 600 districts. In exchange for working under this scheme the person is paid 150 per day. Apart from Employment Exchange, the Government of India publishes a weekly newspaper titled Employment News. It comes out every Saturday evening and gives detailed information about vacancies for government jobs across India. Along with the list of vacancies, it also has the notifications for various government exams and recruitment procedures for government jobs. =Steps taken on Disguised Unemployment= Agriculture is the most labour absorbing sector of the economy. In recent years, there has been a decline in the dependence of population on agriculture partly because of disguised unemployment. Some of the surplus labour in agriculture has moved to either secondary or the tertiary sector. In the secondary sector, small scale manufacturing is the most labour absorbing. In case of the tertiary sector, various new services are now appearing like biotechnology, information technology and so on. The government has taken steps in these sectors for the disguised unemployed people in these methods.Employment News =National Career Service Scheme= The Government of India has initiated National Career Service Scheme whereby a web portal named National Career Service Portal (www.ncs.gov.in) has been launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (India). Through this portal, job-seekers and employers can avail the facility of a common platform for seeking and updating job information. Not only private vacancies, contractual jobs available in the government sector are also available on the portal. =National Rural Employment Programme= The National Rural Employment Programme offers people from the rural areas an equal shot at job opportunities across the nation. The growing disparity in terms of personal finance between those in the rural and urban areas has increasingly led to people from the rural areas to move to the urban areas, making urban management difficult. The NREP aims to provide employment opportunities in the rural areas, especially in times of drought and other such scarcities.National Rural Employment Programme, Yojanas Info =Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana= The Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana is a scheme that aims to help the poor by providing them industrially recognised skills. The scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Rural development. The purpose of the scheme is to eradicate both urban and rural poverty from the country by providing necessary skills to individuals that help them find well-paying job opportunities. This is aimed to be achieved through skill training and skill upgrading which enables the poor to get self-employed, elevate themselves above the poverty line, be eligible for bank loans, etc.Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana Politics In the 2019 Indian general election, unemployment in India was an issue. Economic issues like poverty, unemployment, development are main issues that influence politics. Garibi Hatao (eradicate poverty) has been a slogan of the Indian National Congress for a long time. The well known Bharatiya Janata Party encourages a free market economy. The more popular slogan in this field is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Cooperation with all, progress of all). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) vehemently supports left-wing politics like land-for-all, right to work and strongly opposes neoliberal policies such as globalisation, capitalism and privatisation.

History Cavalry barracks were built in Fulford as part of the British response to the threat of the French Revolution and were completed in 1795 but these have now been largely demolished. The infantry barracks, which were built between 1877 and 1878, were initially the depot of the 14th Regiment of Foot who arrived from Bradford Moor Barracks in 1878. Their creation took place as part of the Cardwell Reforms which encouraged the localisation of British military forces. Following the Childers Reforms, the 14th Regiment of Foot evolved to become the West Yorkshire Regiment with its depot at the barracks in 1881. Under the Cardwell Reforms the two battalions of the 25th (Sussex) Regiment of Foot also established a depot at the barracks but following the Childers Reforms that regiment evolved to become the King's Own Scottish Borderers and moved to Berwick Barracks in 1881. In the 1950s the barracks were renamed Imphal Barracks to reflect the battle honours won by the West Yorkshire Regiment at the Battle of Imphal in spring 1944 during the Second World War. The barracks became the home of the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire when the West Yorkshire Regiment amalgamated with the East Yorkshire Regiment in 1958. The barracks also became the home of Northern Command in 1958. North East District was established at the barracks in 1967 and Northern Command was disbanded in 1972; the barracks additionally became the home of 2nd Division in 1982.

It had a clear focus on preparing brigades for Afghanistan: during summer 2009, the divisional headquarters was significantly reinforced and transformed into Combined Joint Task Force 6 before deploying to Afghanistan as Regional Command South in November 2009. The 6th division headquarters closed in April 2011. Imphal Barracks was the home of 15th Infantry Brigade until 1 December 2014 when it merged with the former 4th Mechanised Brigade to form an infantry brigade known as 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East based in Catterick.

Early years Pierre Sylvain Dumon was born in Agen, Lot-et-Garonne, on 14 February 1797. He studied at the Lycée Henri IV in Paris, then became a lawyer. Under the Bourbon Restoration he joined the bar of the Court of Paris in 1818. He became the secretary of the advocate Dupin the elder, who had defended Marshal Ney in 1815 and was the adviser of the Duke of Orleans. He had liberal views and defended opponents of the regime. He pleaded in the case of the Saumur plot. He gained a distinguished reputation among the liberal advocates of Paris. July Monarchy On 27 March 1831 Dumon was elected deputy for the 1st electoral college of Lot-et-Garonne (Agen). He took his seat with the liberal opposition. He was offered the position of General Counsel in Agen, which he refused. Dumoan was reelected on 5 July 1831. He was named Councillor of State on special duty in 1832. He was reelected on 12 November 1833 and in successive elections in 1834, 1837, 1839 and 1842. He sat with the Doctrinaires. He was vice-president of the legislative committee in 1840, and a member of the committee on Algeria in 1842. Dumon accepted the position of Minister of Public Works on 16 December 1843, and was reelected on 13 January 1844 and on 1 August 1846. He was strongly opposed to state operation of the railways, and favored the monopoly of large companies. He invested much of his personal fortune in railways. This caused him to be violently attacked by the opposition. He also improved the network of roads and waterways. On 9 May 1847 he accepted Finance portfolio, and held this position at the time of the February Revolution of 1848. Dumon resisted change, and rejected proposals to adjust postal rates, and salt tax and cancellation of 3% annuities. He did request approval for increasing the amount of government debt. The government became increasingly unpopular as the economy struggled, the financial situation worsened and reforms were resisted. Dumon was named a knight of the Legion of Honor in 1834 and a grand officer on 29 April 1846. Last years The revolution of 1848 ended Dumon's political career. Fearing that he would be put on trial, and still faithful to the royal family, he fled to England. He returned to France in late December 1848 after the election of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as President of the Republic. He settled in his château of Castels near Agen, but often returned to England to visit the exiled royal family. He also spent time in Paris as a member of the Board of Directors of the P.L.M. Company. In 1859 he became a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques (Academy of Moral and Political Sciences). Dumon died in Paris on 24 February 1870.

One of her biggest inspirations was her aunt, singer Nardy Flores who died at a very young age. Vicente Carattini y Los Cantores de San Juan Alma started her career in 1977 with Vicente Carattini y Los Cantores de San Juan as one of the dancers. A few years later after noticing her vocal abilities, Vicente added her to the choir. Eventually she sang several songs as lead vocalist and finally in 1985's Controversia (Danny Rivera and Vicente's group) she did lead vocals with Danny in two songs (\\"Controversia\\" and \\"De Mi Voz Nació La Luz\\") and did lead vocals by herself on \\"Plena de los Cantores\\". Danny Rivera Controversia was the transition from Vicente to Danny. After falling in love with her voice, Danny Rivera offered to bring her with him to record albums and to go on tour but with the condition that she quit Los Cantores. Her first album as a soloist was Ofrenda (1986) in which she is the only female soloist. In Dulce Encuentro she sings half the song by herself while in other songs like Jardinero de Cariños she sings lead along with Danny. Although her last album with Danny was Mi Canción es Paz in 1987 she kept touring with him until 1992. Soloist In 1997 Alma released her first ever solo album called \\"Jájome\\". Due to poor support by local radio stations her album didn't sell too well. However, in 2009, TV producer Javier Avilés heard and loved the album and decided he wanted to make a TV special about it for Christmas.Jájome el musical FB pageJájome el musical The special included 7 of the 8 songs from the album and was first broadcast on Telemundo Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico TV in 2013.

It is the simplest unsaturated sulfonic acid.H. Distler: Zur Chemie der Vinylsulfonsäure in Angew. Chem. 77 (1965) 291–311, ( PDF). The C=C double bond is a site of high reactivity. polymerize gives polyvinylsulfonic acid, especially when used as a comonomer with functionalized vinyl and (meth)acrylic acid compounds. It is a colorless, water-soluble liquid, although commercial samples can appear yellow or even red.  Preparation  Vinylsulfonic acid is produced industrially by the alkaline hydrolysis of carbyl sulfate with subsequent acidification of the resulting vinyl sulfonate salt: :Vinylsulfonsäure aus Carbylsulfat The reaction is highly exothermic (reaction enthalpy: 1,675 kJ/kg) and requires exact maintenance of temperature and pH during the hydrolysis. When calcium hydroxide is used as the hydrolysis medium, a solution of calcium vinyl sulfonate is obtained. Acidification of this hydrolysis mixture with sulfuric acid gives vinylsulfonic acid, together with the poorly soluble calcium sulfate. Vinylsulfonic acid also can be prepared by dehydration of isethionic acid with phosphorus pentoxide: :Vinylsulfonsäure via Isethionsäure Vinylsulfonic acid can also be prepared by sulfochlorination of chloroethane, dehydrohalogenation to vinylsulfonyl chloride and subsequent hydrolysis of the acid chloride. :\\\\begin{matrix}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{ClCH2-CH3 + SO2 + Cl2 ->[][-\\\\ce{HCl}] ClCH2-CH2-SO2Cl ->[][-\\\\ce{HCl}] H2C=CH-SO2Cl ->[+\\\\ce{H2O}][-\\\\ce{HCl}] H2C=CH-SO3H}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\end{matrix}  Use  The activated C=C double bond of vinylsulfonic acid reacts readily with nucleophiles in an addition reaction. 2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid is formed with ammonia and 2-methylaminoethanesulfonic acid with methylamine. Vinylsulfonic acid is the monomer in the preparation of highly acidic or anionic homopolymers and copolymers. These polymers are used in the electronic industry as photoresists, as ion-conductive polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) for fuel cells. For example, transparent membranes with high ion exchange capacity and proton conductivity can be produced from polyvinylsulfonic acid. Research Vinylsulfonic acid may also be grafted to polymeric supports (e.g. polystyrene) to give highly acidic ion exchangers, which used as catalysts for esterification and Friedel-Crafts acylations.T.

Where the sulfonic acid functionality is not essential, the much more usable alkaline aqueous solution of sodium vinylsulfonate is used, which is obtained directly in the alkaline hydrolysis of the carbyl sulfate and is commercially supplied as an aqueous solution..

Now most states use Malaysian revenue stamps, except for Singapore which is independent and no longer uses revenue stamps. Johore Johore first issued revenues in 1904. From that year until 1922, of postage stamps showing Sultan Ibrahim were overprinted JUDICIAL for court use. These stamps are known with a number of different watermarks as they were in use for almost 20 years. At the same time, postage stamps were used for other non-judicial fiscal needs, and until the 1920s there were various postage stamps with high values that were intended for fiscal use only. During the Japanese occupation in World War II, pre-war dual-purpose postage-and-revenue stamps of Johore were overprinted DAI NIPPON 2602 and were issued as revenues in 1942–43. Some of these were also surcharged with new values or were further overprinted with a handstamp in Japanese. The only post-war revenue issues appeared in 1950 when a set of three high values of $25, $50 and $100 was issued showing the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque. Kedah Kedah's first revenues were three high values of $25, $100 and $250 issued in 1929 showing the Council Chamber building. For lower amounts dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps were used for fiscal needs. These were replaced by another set showing Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim in 1937 with the values of $25, $100 and $500. During the Japanese occupation, pre-war dual-purpose stamps were overprinted DAI NIPPON 2602, and they are known used both fiscally and for postal purposes. Kedah was ceded to Thailand in 1943 and renamed Syburi, and a single revenue stamp depicting the state's coat of arms and inscribed with the new name was issued in 1945. In 1950, when it was part of the Federation of Malaya, Kedah issued its last revenue stamps showing Sultan Badlishah with the values of $25, $100 and $250. Kelantan Kelantan issued very few revenue stamps. A single $25 value showing Sultan Ismail was issued in 1937. When Kelantan was occupied by Japan, various stamps postage were overprinted FISCAL to be used exclusively for revenue purposes in 1942–43. This overprint was applied to a wide range of issues, including stamps of the Japanese occupation of Kelantan (themselves overprinted on pre-war Kelantan postage-and-revenue stamps) and on general issues for Japanese Malaya (themselves overprinted on pre-war issues of the Straits Settlements and various other states). After the Japanese transferred control of Kelantan to Thailand, a set of revenue stamps depicting the state's coat of arms and inscribed in Jawi was issued in 1944–45. A second set depicting the new sultan Ibrahim IV and inscribed in Thai, Jawi and English was also issued in 1944–45. In 1950 another three values of $25, $100 and $250 were issued once again showing Ibrahim IV and an agricultural scene with a buffalo plough. Malacca Until 1942 Malacca was part of the Straits Settlements and used their revenue stamps. Its only revenues were a set of three \\"Nyasaland\\" keytype high values issued in 1950 showing King George VI. Negri Sembilan Negri Sembilan's first revenues were Sungei Ujong revenues overprinted JUDICIAL N.S. and further surcharged, for use in law courts. Around 1891 Straits Settlements revenues were overprinted with the name of the state for other non-judicial purposes, while postage stamps were overprinted J or JUDICIAL or further surcharged around 1900. In the meantime dual-purpose postage & revenue stamps were used fiscally, and then Federated Malay States revenues were used. Between 1936 and 1939 high values of $25 and $100 showing elephants were issued. A set of three $25, $100 and $250 values was issued between in 1950 again showing elephants. Pahang Pahang's first revenue stamps were issued around 1890. The first series consisted of Straits Settlements revenues overprinted PAHANG in two different formats. Dual-purpose postage & revenue stamps were later used for fiscal purposes, and from around 1900 Federated Malay States revenues were used. In 1903 Perak postage stamps were issued overprinted $50 Pahang for use as a fiscal, but FMS revenues also remained in use. In 1936 a $25 value showing elephants was issued. In 1944–45, during the Japanese occupation, various pre-war stamps were handstamped Dai Nippon 2602 Malaya for use as revenues in Pahang. The overprint was applied to the $25 Pahang revenue stamp issued in 1936, as well as to postage-and-revenue stamps of the Straits Settlements and the states of Kedah, Perak and Selangor. A set of three $25, $100 and $250 values was issued in 1950 showing Sultan Abu Bakar. Penang Prior to World War II Penang was part of the Straits Settlements and used their revenue stamps. In 1942, during the Japanese occupation, pre-war postage-and-revenue stamps of the Straits Settlements were overprinted with the seal of Akira Okugawa (Chief of the Treasury section of Penang) or DAI NIPPON 2602 PENANG, and these were used for both revenue and postal purposes. High value Straits Settlements revenues overprinted with the Okugawa seal, along with lower value dual-purpose stamps overprinted with a different Okugawa seal, were issued solely for fiscal use in Penang in 1942–43. After the war, Penang issued a set of three \\"Nyasaland\\" keytype stamps showing King George VI in 1949. Perak From 1880 to 1892 various judicial or revenue stamps of the Straits Settlements were overprinted PERAK in a wide range of styles and fonts. From 1896 to 1899 postage stamps showing tigers or elephants were overprinted Judicial or JUDICIAL while dual-purpose postage & revenue stamps were used for other fiscal purposes. In 1900 a postage stamp was issued overprinted Three Cents Revenue only for fiscal use, and later that year Federated Malay States revenues began to be used. Between 1936 and 1939 high values of $25 and $100 showing elephants were issued. While occupied by Japan, Perak issued a single stamp showing a map of the Malayan Peninsula with the state of Perak highlighted and the flag of Japan over it. The stamp was issued in 1943 with a red border around the rouletting, and in 1944–45 it was reissued without this border. Non-adhesive revenues inscribed Perak Shu Seicho Stamp Fees Paid were also used during the Japanese occupation. Between 1949 and 1952, a set of three $25, $100 and $250 values was also issued, once again showing elephants. Perlis Perlis' only revenues were a set of three values issued in 1951 showing the Syed Alwi State Mosque in Kangar. Selangor Selangor's first revenue stamps were issued around 1880. The first series consisted of Straits Settlements large format revenues overprinted SELANGOR reading up. The Straits Settlements issued a new set of revenues in 1882, and these were also issued with Selangor overprints between 1884 and 1891. At least thirteen different types of the overprint are known to exist. Between 1897 and 1902 postage stamps of Selangor were also overprinted J or JUDICIAL for use in courts. In the meantime, dual-purpose postage & revenue stamps were then used for non-judicial fiscal purposes, and from around 1900 Federated Malay States revenues were used. Between 1936 and 1939 high values of $25 and $100 showing elephants were issued. Between 1942 and 1945, while under Japanese occupation, Selangor issued a wide variety of revenue stamps by overprinting various issues with the Japanese word for \\"Tax\\", 税. This overprint was applied to pre-war dual-purpose or revenue-only stamps of Selangor itself, as well as to pre-war dual-purpose stamps of the Straits Settlements and various other states, pre-war revenue stamps of the Federated Malay States and various other states, and to postage stamps issued during the Japanese occupation (themselves overprinted on a wide variety of pre-war stamps of Selangor itself, the Straits Settlements or various states). A final set of three $25, $100 and $250 values was issued in 1950 showing Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah. Singapore Until 1942 Singapore was part of the Straits Settlements and used their revenue stamps. Its first revenues were a set of three \\"Nyasaland\\" keytype high values issued between 1948 and 1953 showing King George VI. These were reissued with the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II between 1954 and 1964. Singapore also issued various entertainments duty stamps to pay the tax on cinema tickets between 1955 and 1965. Singapore left Malaysia in 1965 and continued to issue its own revenue stamps independently until they were withdrawn in 1999. Sungei Ujong Sungei Ujong's first revenue stamps were issued around 1880. The first series consisted of Straits Settlements large format revenues overprinted SUNGEI UJONG in one line reading down. The Straits Settlements issued a new set of revenues in 1882, and these were also issued with Sungei Ujong overprints between 1884 and 1890. At least five different types of the overprint are known to exist. In 1893, postage stamps showing a leaping tiger were overprinted JUDICIAL for use in courts. Sungei Ujong became part of Negri Sembilan in 1896. Trengganu Trengganu initially used dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps for fiscal purposes, and like some other states it had high values solely intended for revenue use. During the Japanese occupation, various dual-purpose postage-and-revenue stamps were overprinted FISCAL restricting them to revenue use. When the Japanese gave Trengganu to Thailand a set of stamps showing a sailing boat was issued in 1944–45. In 1950 a set of three stamps showing a traditional fishing boat were issued.

Frøisland became known for expanding the journalistic efforts of the newspaper, and starting the weekly A-magasinet. In the 1927 Norwegian parliamentary election he was fielded as the second ballot candidate for the party National Legion, behind Karl Meyer and ahead of Thorvald Aadahl and Jens Bratlie. In a press release, the National Legion (led by Meyer) stated that it had cherrypicked \\"strong\\" personalities to combat the hardships in Norwegian politics. Frøisland denounced the ballot in an Aftenposten piece, stating that himself, Aadahl and Bratlie were unwilling and unaware of the nomination. He stated that a vote for the National Legion would be a wasted vote in the ongoing struggle against the \\"communists\\". However, according to Norwegian election law the people who were listed on the ballot had no legal grounds to avoid being nominated. The National Legion did not win any seats. In May 1919, Frøisland married the pianist Astrid Helene Fagstad (1885–1945). Frøisland died in January 1930 in Oslo.

Doctoral dissertation For part of his doctoral dissertation, Browning conducted, over a period of two years, an ethnographic study of people who self-identify as vampire in New Orleans. Browning's fieldnotes recount the experience: \\"On the eve of the second Tuesday of every month, I have become, to the watchful bystander, a familiar presence in the French Quarter. Flying through the dusky sky over Bourbon Street, as I strolled along casually, were fast, sweeping brown bats: An homage, maybe, to the business of interviewing vampires? To my side hung the trusty brown leather satchel that housed my pen and paper, and digital voice recorder. I left politely at home, of course, the crucifix I didn’t actually own, and the short wooden stake carved for me by an older brother when I was younger. For indeed the vampires with whom I was meeting tonight were not prisoners of lore and legend: theirs was a new lore, and they were becoming very quickly their own legend.\\" Browning extended his ethnographic fieldwork to include real vampires living in Buffalo, NY. For an op-ed in Deep South Magazine entitled Conversations with Real Vampires, Browning's notes further recount the experience: \\"We are meeting an hour later than usual for the third month in a row, because the sun, during the summer months, sets closer to 9 instead of 8. Tonight, I will ask for the first time if I can watch them feed.” Browning has more recently elaborated on his experiences in Palgrave Communications,Browning, John Edgar (2015). \\"The real vampires of New Orleans and Buffalo: a research note towards comparative ethnography.\\" Palgrave Communications 1:15006 doi: 10.1057/palcomms.2015.6.

In 750, Kiyokawa was appointed envoy to Tang China, with Ōtomo no Komaro and Kibi no Makibi as vice-envoys. Before his departure, the Emperor gave him a as a sign of his command, and he was granted the rank of . Upon arriving in Tang China, the envoy entered Chang'an and had an audience with Emperor Xuanzong, who praised them as proper gentlemen. At the New Year's greeting ceremony in 753 where the various domains offered well-wishes to the Tang Emperor, the Japanese delegation was seated in the second position on the west side, after the Tibetan Empire. Meanwhile, Silla was seated in the first position on the east side. Komaro protested, and the Japanese envoy changed seats with Silla in order to save face. Almost a year later, Kiyokawa's group set out to return to Japan, accompanied by Abe no Nakamaro, who had lived in China for 35 years and was a high official there as well. The monk Jianzhen wished to accompany them, but as the Tang government had forbidden his departure from China, Kiyokawa refused him. However, the vice-envoy Komaro snuck him on board. Their ships departed from Yangzhou, but the boat carrying Kiyokawa and Nakamaro met a strong headwind and washed ashore farther south, in what is now northern Vietnam. The natives attacked the ship, killing many of its crew, and Kiyokawa and Nakamaro barely escaped with their lives. The second ship, carrying Jianzhen, reached Japan without incident. In 755, Kiyokawa and Nakamaro returned to Chang'an. Kiyokawa took up the Tang-style name of Heqing (河清), and became the . In 759, a delegation led by entered China through Balhae to take Kiyokawa home. However, because China was in a state of turmoil due to the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang court forbade his return due to the danger of the roads. In 763, although Kiyokawa was still in China, the Japanese court appointed him governor of Hitachi Province, and in 764 he was promoted to . Still unable to return to Japan, Kiyokawa spent another decade in China before another Japanese envoy arrived in 777, and in 778 he died, still in China. The Tang court granted him the posthumous rank of . Having at some point married a Chinese woman, he had one daughter, named , who accompanied the envoy back to Japan.

Etymology The term consists of two words \\"Do\\" which means two and \\"mah\\" or \\"mas\\" meaning month. The word 'Domahi' means the junction of two months.Datta, Birendrnath (1995), Folk Culture of the Goalpara Region, p.98 Types The festival is subdivided into \\"Maghar Domahi\\" (mid January), \\"Baihagar or Baishakh Domahi\\" (mid April) and \\"Katir or Kartika Domahi\\" (mid October). Astronomically Baihagar Domahi is associated Vernal equinox, Kati Domahi with Autumnal equinox and Maghar Domahi with Winter solstice. Greater importance is attached to the winter festival than to the spring festival. But the third festival, held in autumn, is not always considered as another Domahi. =Maghar Domahi= Maghar Domahi or Domasi is festival of feasting after end of harvesting season and year. Its celebrated around mid of January. A mass feast is organised on eve of this festival called as \\"log bhaat\\". =Baihagar Domahi= Baihagar or Baishakh Domahi is special spring time festival. A fair usually held in the first week of Baihag or third week of April. It is known as \\"Bhatheli\\" in northern Kamrup, \\"Sori\\" or \\"Suanri\\" in southern Kamrup. In the southern part of Kamrup, where the festival is known as Sori, planting of tall bamboos is not seen, but bamboo posts, with the tuft at the top. People bow before the bamboos in northern Kamrup and they also touch them with reverence. Bhatheli Bhatheli as called in North Kamrup ( Nalbari, Rangiya etc.), held in month of Vaisakha. Each area decorates a long bamboo with flag and streamers. The one that adjusted best is called the bridegroom. The others who are termed brides, are then ranged around it in circle, and a mock marriage ceremony is performed.B.C. Allen (1905), Kamrup District Gazetteer,p.111 The one of the main feature is the planting of two green Bamboos. On the fixed date in the morning young men take purifying baths. They cut two bamboos and decorated it with coloured cloth and chowries, followed by celebrations with music and instruments. A large scale fair accompanied with trading of different commodities. In the south Kamrup where it is known as \\"Sori\\" or \\"Suanri\\" follows the same pattern with little variations. In Bajali area of north Kamrup bamboo is kept against a Banyan tree called as \\"Madan Mohan Gosain\\", a name of Krishna. Banikanta Kakati draws attention towards similarity between Bhatheli and ancient Indradhwaja festival.Banikanta Kakati, Visnuite Myths and Legends, pp.64-65 The Indradhwaja festival is described as \\"Sakrotthana\\" in the Kalika Purana, and it took place around a pole with flags. The procedures for the festival as described in the Kalika Purana approximate the preparations to be made for the celebrations of Bhatheli of the present days.

Released on June 8, 2012, it was his first studio album since 2000 and his first album of original material since 1994's Resurrection. It was produced by Damon Albarn and Richard Russell and released on the UK-based XL Recordings label. Recording took place between October 3 and December 2, 2011 in London and New York City studios, followed by a brief recording session in London on March 7, 2012.Recording dates from album liner notes. In the period between December and March recordings, Womack was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. In the period between the last recording session and the album's release he was diagnosed with colon cancer and successfully treated through surgery. The first song released from the album, \\"Please Forgive My Heart\\", was offered as a free download on XL Recordings's official website on March 8, 2012. Critical reception Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork said: \\"Already an industry veteran by the time he broke out as a solo artist in the 1970s, Bobby Womack had a music personality to match his vocal chops. He inhabits his songs with a gruffness that cuts through even the most florid arrangements to communicate romantic agony or social outrage. Like so many of his contemporaries, he struggled in subsequent decades to match those early hits, eventually reappearing in 2010 on Gorillaz' Plastic Beach. On this first glimpse of his first album in nearly 20 years, The Bravest Man in the Universe, co-producers Damon Albarn and Richard Russell don't try to re-create the musical flourishes of his old material. Instead, they opt for a burbling piano and synth syncopation that sounds like futuristic R&B.; The pair's sonic touches are hypnotic enough to sound unobtrusive, providing an intriguing contrast with Womack's coarsely textured voice, but also allowing him to sound as direct as ever. \\"Please Forgive My Heart\\" conveys regret as an existential state of being, which sounds all the more powerful for coming so late in a bold career: \\"Time is not commuted,\\" he sings. \\"It lingers, lingers without a sound.\\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13293-please-forgive-my-heart/ Credits *Damon Albarn – executive production, backing vocals, piano, drum machine, composition, synthesizer, mixing, engineering *Jason Cox – recording, engineering, mixing *Rirchard Russell – executive production, drum programming, MIDI, drum machine, MPC, AKAI MPC 500, production, mixing, engineering *Stephen Sedgwick – recording, engineering, mixing *Harold Payne – additional production *Bobby Womack – lead vocals, backing vocals, guitar, various References Category:Bobby Womack songs Category:XL Recordings singles Category:Songs written by Damon Albarn Category:Songs written by Bobby Womack Category:2012 songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:2012 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Bobby Womack Category:Neo soul songs ","title":"Please Forgive My Heart"},{"id":"42343236","text":"Murman Omanidze (; born November 5, 1938) is a former Georgian politician and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Georgia in 1991.  Career  Born in Tbilisi, Omanidze graduated from the Faculty of International Law, Tbilisi State University. He headed a legal department of the state-run agricultural company Suplmsheni from 1977 to 1985 and worked as a manager at the Ministry of Construction of the Georgian SSR from 1985 to 1989. During the rise of anti-Soviet and independence movement, Omanidze joined the Afghan Union of Georgia, an organization of the Georgian veterans of the Soviet–Afghan War, being its deputy chairman from 1990 to 1991. He became part of the government of Georgia as Deputy Minister of Transportation from March to May 1991. In a newly independent Georgia, Omanidze was appointed by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in August 1991. That same month, he was briefly an acting Prime Minister following the scandalous resignation of Tengiz Sigua. During the August 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, the opposition in Georgia alleged that Omanidze traveled to Moscow to meet members of the State Committee on the State of Emergency. After the coup collapsed, the Georgian leadership strongly denied such allegations. The opposition launched a military coup against Gamsakhurdia in December 1991. During the fighting in Tbilisi, Gamsakhurdia summoned Omanidze to a government house bunker, where he had entrenched himself against the rebel assaults. Omanidze was effectively placed under arrest and removed from his positions on December 31. Omanidze succeeded in escaping to Russia on 4 January and denounced Gamsakhurdia as a dictator. After Gamsakhurdia's flight from Georgia and Eduard Shevardnadze's accession to power, Omanidze was a member of the Parliament of Georgia from 1992 to 1998. He was also involved in several businesses. In 1996, the Georgian prosecutor’s office issued a warrant for the arrest of Omanidze on charges of illicit financial dealings. He managed to leave Georgia and distanced himself from politics.

Its natural habitat is temperate forests. It is sometimes known as the teetotum or rainbird.Grey warbler - New Zealand Birds Online http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/grey-warbler Description One of the smallest birds found in New Zealand, grey warblers are about 11 centimeters long, with a weight of up to 6.5 grams. It has grey- brown plumage (with a slight olive-green tint), with the face, throat and breast being pale-grey. The abdomen is off-white with a slight yellow tinge. The tail is white underneath and dark brown on top with white tips being visible in flight. They also have a distinctive ruby-red eye. Females are typically smaller than the male, but otherwise there is little sexual dimorphism. The young are paler with no hint of yellow and have brown eyes. = Song = The male's song often starts with a series of three squeaks and builds into a distinctive long plaintive wavering trill that rises and falls. They sing throughout the year but most vigorously when nesting, during spring. Grey warblers are often heard more than they are seen. Distribution and habitat Grey warblers are common throughout New Zealand's main islands and many off-shore islands, but are absent from open country and alpine areas. At home in native and exotic forests it may be found almost anywhere there is some tree or shrub cover.Atlas Of Bird Distribution In New Zealand 1999–2004 - Ornithological Society of New Zealand http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/bird-distribution-atlas-1999-2004-last-gasp-field Behaviour =Diet= Grey warblers mainly feed upon spiders, insects and their larvae. They are very active, and almost never stay still as they move from one perch to another. =Nesting= Illustrations of grey warbler nests (1888)Juvenile grey warblerGrey warblers are unique among New Zealand birds in building a pear-shaped nest with a side entrance near the top. The male collects nesting material, but the female builds the nest from grass, leaves, rootlets and moss, held together with spider web threads, anywhere from 2 to 25 feet above the ground, lined with feathers and other soft material. It is attached to a twig at the top, but is often also secured at the back or sides. The male is not involved in nest building or incubation, but helps to feed nestlings and fledglings. The 3 to 6 eggs, each laid 2 days apart, are pinkish-white with fine reddish-brown speckles all over. The eggs, weighing 1.5 grams are about 17 millimetres long and 12 millimetres wide. Incubation takes about 19 days and the chicks spend another 15 to 19 days in the nest. Their breeding season is from August to January and they usually manage two clutches. The shining bronze cuckoo, a brood parasite, often targets the second clutch. In Māori culture The direction in which a grey warbler would build its nest served as an indicator of forthcoming weather conditions to Māori – in this respect, the bird was known as a manu tohu tau. The tradition states that a grey warbler will build the nest entrance in the opposite direction to the prevailing wind. As such, a eastern-facing entrance would indicate a poorly season brought on by western winds; in contrast, a northern-facing entrance would suggest a pleasant season ahead. In spring, the song of the grey warbler is said to be a signal for Māori to begin planting their crops. As such, those whose 'ignore' the call of the grey warbler and do not help out with the planting of crops (and later seek to reap the harvest for themselves) are rebuked with the following whakataukī (proverb): References * NZ Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, Nov 2003 * Gerygone Flaviventris. -- (Grey Warbler.)

After declaring an emergency, the crew landed the aircraft safely at RAAF Base Learmonth. It was later determined that the incident, which caused 119 injuries, 14 of them serious, was the result of a design flaw of the plane's Air Data Inertial Reference Unit and a limitation of the aircraft's flight computer software. *On 1 June 2009, Air France Flight 447, an A330-200 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of the islands of Fernando de Noronha, with no survivors. Malfunctioning pitot tubes provided an early focus for the investigation, as the aircraft involved had Thales-built \\"–AA\\" models known to record faulty airspeed data during icing conditions. In July 2009, Airbus advised A330 and A340 operators to replace Thales pitots with equivalents manufactured by Goodrich. Investigators later determined that the inadequate response of the pilots to both a loss of airspeed data and subsequent autopilot disengagement resulted in Flight 447 entering into an aerodynamic stall. *On 25 December 2009, passengers and crew subdued a man who attempted to detonate explosives in his underwear on an A330-300 operating Northwest Airlines Flight 253. *On 12 May 2010, Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771, an A330-200, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya, on a flight from OR Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg, South Africa.

She received a postgraduate degree in \\"Library Management\\" from the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona; as well as in “Government and Public Management in the Information Society: Electronic Government”, from the Pompeu Fabra University and the Escola d’Administració Pública de Catalunya. Between 1992 and 2001, Pérez-Salmerón served as the first director of the Casacuberta Central Urban Library of Badalona, coordinator of the libraries in the north of the Barcelonés municipality and delegate at the UNET (UNESCO Model Library Network). Between 2001 and 2005, she was appointed Technical Director of the Network of Municipal Libraries of the Diputació de Barcelona. In 2005 she became Head of Library Cooperation Service of the Department of Culture and Media at the Generalitat de Catalunya, from which she coordinated the Library System of Catalonia. In 2008, she was elected President of the Spanish Federation of Societies of Archivist, Librarians, Documentalists and Museology (FESABID), a position she held until September 2010, whilst she was Head of the Office of Assistance in Electronic Administration at the Diputació de Barcelona in which she managed, amongst other duties, the municipal register of 268 municipalities of the province of Barcelona, “the adaptation to the LOPD (Data Protection Act), the technological development of the OACs (Citizen’s Attention Offices) and the design and maintenance of the municipal websites if the province of Barcelona. Glòria Pérez-Salmerón is also Vice President of the European Bureau of Library, Information and Documentation Associations (EBLIDA) and member of the Management Committee of The European Library (TEL). In July 2010 she was elected Director of the National Library of Spain, a proposal made by the then Minister of Culture Ángeles González-Sinde, after consulting the Board of Trustees of the National Library. Ángeles González-Sinde emphasised her experience in digitalisation projects and stated that she was the perfect person to see the Library “through the transition from analogue to digital”. As Director of the BNE, she elaborated and directed the activities to commemorate the institution’s tricentenary from the end of 2011 to the end of 2012, centred mainly on bringing citizens closer to the BNE. During her time as director she also established the drafting of the 29th of July 23/2011 law, the legal deposit and studied and initiated the drafting of the Royal Decree of Legal Digital Deposits as well as creating the National Repository which holds these. She also began a Strategic Plan for the 2012-2014 triennial, based on a programme with four main values: quality, austerity, coherence and permanent vocation. Under Pérez-Salmerón's management, the BNE developed a project of systematic digitalization of holdings, thanks to a partnership agreement with Telefónica – it foresaw the digitalization of 200,000 book titles between 2008 and 2012. In those two years, the Iberian American Digital Library (BDPI) project also flourished and became a reality in October 2012, during the Association of National Libraries’ (ABINIA) General Assembly, with the creation of an access portal to the collections of the American digital libraries. IFLA Secretary General Gerald Leitner and IFLA President Glòria Pérez-Salmerón making award to Honorary fellow Sinikka Sipilä in 2018 At the end of 2011, the BNE incorporated the World Digital Library, contributing with some of the most important works of its collections. She launched the BNE 2.0 intranet as a horizontal communication tool and the library’s Museum activities, and improved the BNE’s presence on the Internet via its website and social media. Together with her team, she worked to achieve the library’s own statute, which facilitated its self-management and leadership abilities at a global level. In January 2012, the new government ratified Glòria Pérez- Salmerón in her role as Director of the National Library of Spain.«El Ministerio apoya la gestión de Glòria Pérez-Salmerón al frente de la BNE» On 18 February 2013, she was dismissed as Director of the National Library of Spain.http://www.bne.es/es/AreaPrensa/noticias2013/0218_RelevoDireccionBNE.html?pagina=1 She was the President of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) in 2018 and has been President of the Spanish Federation of Societies of Archivist, Librarians, Documentalists and Museology (FESABID), and Vice President of EBLIDA, European Bureau of Library, Information and Documentation Associations.

Although there are several ecosystems and environmentally distinct, this nature reserve includes three principal areas (the calderas Funda and Rasa, the mountain region of Morro Alto and Pico da Sé and the islet of Maria Vaz), in addition to several protected areas. History The creation of this Nature Park was made in order to aggregate various protected areas, with various diverse protection statutes covering bio- and geo-diversity. The protected areas included are classified as nature reserves, natural monuments, protected areas for habitat preservation, areas for landscape protection and areas protected for natural resource management. The Nature Park was created by regional legislative decree on 23 March 2011 (law 8/2011/A). The island of Flores became part of the network of World Biosphere Reserves (UNESCO), along with the islands of Corvo and Graciosa, on 27 May 2009. The area that is included in the biosphere definition includes most of the island, in addition to the marine ecosystems around them: in total the region includes 58,619 hectares, selected for the landscapes, geological, environmental and cultural characteristics that make it unique. Part of its designation comes from its importance as nesting areas for migratory and marine bird species. The higher altitudes and humid areas of the Central Plateau is known for Atlantic peat bog and forest of Juniperus brevifolia, vital for the island's hydrology and for supporting the ravines and waterfalls that define the landscape. Geography A view of the debris field of Fajã de Lopo Vaz The snow-covered interior hilltops of Pico de Sé The twin lakes of Lagoa Cumprido and Lagoa Rasa The Flores Nature Park is actually a dispersed reserve that encompasses several individual areas of protection. The nature reserve encourages the use of the spaces and promotes biodiversity, through nature tourism and the creation of local products. Meanwhile, the regional government provides incentives for promoting scientific investigation, projects to promote international cooperation and sustainable development. =Classified areas= Nature reserves Those areas classified as Nature Reserves () include: * [FLO01] Nature Reserve of the islet of Maria Vaz ()Diário da República (23 March 2011), p.1632 * [FLO02] Nature Reserve of Morro Alto and Pico da Sé () * [FLO03] Nature Reserve of Caldeiras Funda and Rasa (),Diário da República (23 March 2011), p.1622 defined by a line that extends from Pico da Marcela to the altitude and extends to the southeast, curving at a peak that separates the water bodies of Caldeira Funda and Ribeira Funda.

He is ranked as First Class Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Envoy.  Career  Gogi Khoshtaria was born in Tbilisi in the family of Georgian intelligentsia. His father, Metode Khoshtaria (1911–1938), a highway engineer and a nephew of the wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist Akaki Khoshtaria, was shot at the age of 27 during the Great Purge. His mother, Tinatin Virsaladze (1907–1985), was an art historian. Gogi Khoshtaria was also trained as an art historian at the Tbilisi State University and pursued an academic career. In the 1980s, he joined the dissident movement and became closely associated with Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who became the first post-Communist leader of Georgia and made Khoshtaria Minister of Foreign Affairs on November 26, 1990. As a foreign minister, Khoshtaria met with the Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh twice after Georgia's declaration of independence in April 1991, but the relations between Moscow and Tbilisi became increasingly tense and the contacts between the two ministries ceased by mid-1991. Khoshtaria worked with the Turkish government for closer Georgian–Turkish relations and resisted the Soviet attempts to bring these ties under control. He also visited Germany and France in April and the United States in June 1991 to further the Georgian independence cause and lobby for closer economic relations. Despite his efforts, Khoshtaria became alienated from Gamsakhurdia and was dismissed in August 1991. He cited Gamsakhurdia's authoritarian tendencies and failure to immediately denounce the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt as the reasons behind the split. After his retirement, Khoshtaria resumed academic career. He lectures at several other academia and is a frequent commentator on culture and monument protection.

The estate is named in reference to the nearby Regent's Canal, which was commissioned by the Prince Regent who later became King George IV. It is adjacent to, but distinct from, the Regents Court Estate. The estate is situated between Queensbridge Road, Pownall Road, Brownlow Road and Brougham Road. It is to the south east of London Fields and adjoins Broadway Market to the west. Housing The estate comprises council housing built in the late 1970s and early 1980s and owned or by the London Borough of Hackney. The estate is a mix of terraced houses, purpose built flats in smaller blocks, with 3 large blocks of flats on Broke Walk, Marlborough Avenue and an additional block on Brownlow Road that was included as part of the estate in 2006. As terraced houses have been sold under the right to buy scheme, this has resulted in a mixed ownership of freeholders, long leaseholders, council tenants and Housing Association tenants. Facilities The estate has three community buildings: The Regent Estate Community Centre/Hall, The Regent Estate Pensions Club/Hall and The Regent Estate Community Office. The latter is used by Hackney Homes Cleaning Services. The estate is served by the Ozen Supermarket. The estate houses the Workshop 44 gallery, based in a shop space which stood shuttered up for over a decade.

He incorporated counseling techniques that take into account the students' feelings toward their learning experience, and are meant to lower the affective filter. In the early 1970s he proposed Community Language Learning as a method based on his approach. His views, which were mostly promoted and tested by his students Paul G. La Forge (1971) and Taylor (1979), among others, gained particular attention and prominence in the 1980s & 1990s through the work of Jennybelle P. Rardin (1994), Keiko Komimy (1994) and Katherine M. Clarke (1989). As a priest, he wrote several books in which he addressed the topic of institutionalized religious education, and the theological concept of sin compared to the sense of guilt in psychotherapy.Curran, Charles A. \\"The concept of sin and guilt in psychotherapy.\\" Journal of Counseling Psychology, Vol 7(3), 1960, 192-197.

He was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and the Ukrainian Star For Courage (later known as the Order For Courage). Life Pravik was only twenty-three years old when the Chernobyl disaster occurred. He was a college graduate, engaged in creative endeavors such as photography, drawing, and poetry. He was also a member of the Komsomol, the youth division of the Communist Party. Pravik was married to a kindergarten teacher, who had just given birth to their first child when he died. Chernobyl disaster When the explosion happened, Pravik and his men were resting in the fire station. He heard the explosion and seconds later came an alarm. He was told that the roof was on fire. Pravik dispatched 4 firetrucks over to the power plant. Once Pravik reached Unit 3, he saw the burning ruins of Reactor 4 and sounded a stage 3 alert, meaning every available fire station in the Kiev region had to respond. He parked his trucks outside between Units 3&4 on the North side of the plant. He and another man, Sergeant Leonid Shavrey, ran inside the plant to conduct reconnaissance and find the source of the fire. After a while of running through empty corridors, Pravik found a telephone on the wall which was connected directly to Unit 4's control room. No one answered. He found 2 distressed plant workers who suggested that the turbine hall and the roof of Unit 3 had caught fire. Pravik and Shavrey returned to their trucks, the men from Pripyat Fire Station had arrived, he spoke briefly with Lieutenant Kibenok. Pripyat brought their ZIL-131 AL30 (mechanical ladder-truck). It was deployed on the north side of the plant, and used to access the unit 3 fire escape stairs, which they used to climb to the roof of Unit 3. He went to Unit 3's roof with five other men, Viktor Kibenok, Vasily Ignatenko, Nikolai Titenok, Nikolai Vashchuck and Vladimir Tishura. He reached the top of Unit 3 and deployed his hoses. As this was happening, Pravik's men from the NPP fire station were extinguishing fires on the turbine hall roof. During the explosion, the standpipes that supplied water had been blown off. So Kibenok had to radio in his Ural water tanker. Pravik twisted his hose but no water came out, just a dry hiss, Pravik then called down his radio \\"Give me more pressure!\\". After around 30 minutes on the roof, they all started to stumble and collapse, they were all vomiting. They started to make their way back down the fire escape. Men who stayed with the trucks ran to help. Ambulances arrived, and took them away, Leonid Telyatnikov arrived 10 minutes prior and took over command. Pravik and the others spent a day in Hospital 126 in Pripyat, before they were transported by helicopter to Moscow Hospital No.6 which specialised in radiation accidents. He died on May 11th 1986 at the age of 23. It is estimated that Pravik got a 750 rad dose (855 roentgen, 7.5 Sv).

History The site was acquired by the War Office from Newcastle Corporation in 1804 and, following the construction of three barrack blocks, became the home of units of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons under the name of Newcastle Barracks in 1806. The officers' mess, designed by James Wyatt, was completed around the same time. Soldiers' duties included putting down the Chartism movement riots in the 1840s. In 1846 units of the Royal Horse Artillery arrived and in 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the two battalions of the 5th (Northumberland Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 5th Regiment of Foot evolved to become the Northumberland Fusiliers with its depot at the barracks in 1881 and the Durham Light Infantry arrived from Sunderland Barracks in 1884. The Durham Light Infantry museum opened at Fenham Barracks shortly after the First World War but moved out to Brancepeth Castle when the regiment transferred there in 1939. The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers museum opened at Fenham Barracks in 1929 and remained there after the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers were absorbed into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1962. The museum finally moved out to Alnwick Castle in 1970. The majority of the Georgian barracks buildings were demolished in the 1970s and replaced with new buildings (those that remained were sold off twenty years later and now serve as student residences). In 1975 the barracks became the home of 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars; they moved out in 1992 when the regiment was amalgamated to form part of the Light Dragoons.

It was last assigned to the United States Army Personnel Distribution Command. It was closed on 15 December 1946. The Greensboro Center opened in November 1941 as the headquarters of the First Technical Training District, Air Corps Technical Training Command.ACTTC was formed at Chanute Field, IL, 26 Mar 1941. The command moved to permanent headquarters in Tulsa, OK, in Sep 41. On 15 Mar 42 redesignated AAFTTC. On 16 Apr 42, after moving from Tulsa, OK, HQ AAFTTC opened at Knollwood, NC. On 31 Jul 43, Army Air Forces Technical Training Command prepared for inactivation. Its resources and its technical and basic military training missions transferred to Army Air Forces Flying Training Command. At the same time, the War Department redesignated AAFFTC as the Army Air Forces Training Command. The command now included over 600 training installations and more than a million people. In 1943, it was expanded to become AAF Basic Training Center No. 10, welcoming nearly 90,000 men into the United States Army Air Forces to undergo basic military training (BMT). Transferred to the Army Personnel Distribution Center in June 1944, the Greensboro Overseas Replacement Depot (ORD), arranged the deployment of over 150,000 airmen to overseas groups and squadrons in combat theaters around the world. With the end of the war in 1945, nearly 30,000 men were demobilized from the Army Air Forces and returned to civilian life at Greensboro. History The center was established as a headquarters for the Technical Training Command, First District on 1 November 1941 which operated from the Pilot Life Complex in Sedgefield.Greenboro, It's Past and Present. Headquarters, Public Relations Office, AAF Overseas Replacement Depot and AAF Redistrubution Station No. 5, 31 January 1946 However severe overcrowding at Basic Training Center No. 7 at Atlantic City, New Jersey led to the decision to expand Greensboro in 1942 to accommodate and train recruits. 652 acres on the city's east side was leased for a facility large enough to train and mobilize the tens of thousands of crewmen needed for the air war in Europe and Asia. Strategically located, surrounded by the necessary transportation and support facilities. Basic Training Center No. 10 opened on 1 March 1943, and during the spring and summer of 1943, carpenters were erecting barracks and warehouses. Trainees endured from four to eight weeks of intensive training in weapons, drill, physical fitness, and chemical warfare. Airmen then left for advanced training at other bases prior to assignment in combat theaters around the world. At first the center was limited to new recruits, however it was expanded to include new nurses, pre-aviation cadets, convalescents, and regular Army and Service troops. Among the 87,500 trainees who passed through the facility were members of the Women's Air Corps, whose six-week stints trained them in a variety of administrative and support fields. The center also trained African American airmen, a fact that displeased some of Greensboro's citizens. Black servicemen were segregated, and despite their repeated requests for equal treatment as military personnel, their training was restricted to support services and labor battalions. Training continued by ETTC until 1 May 1944 when jurisdiction of Greensboro was transferred to the AAF Personnel Distribution Command. The mission was changed from basic training to the perpetration of airmen and soldiers for overseas combat duty. AAF personnel, many who had completed basic training at Greensboro were assigned to one of the overseas air forces, equipped and scheduled for deployment to whatever part of the world they were needed. In February 1945, overseas shipments were ended and Personnel Redistribution Center No. 5 was established to begin the task of returning overseas personnel from the European Theater of Operations, and the Mediterranean Theater of Operations to the Pacific Theater to enter combat against the Japanese Empire. With the end of the war in the Pacific, on 17 September 1945 the final mission of Greensboro was initiated, to assist in the expedient separation of personnel back to civilian life. That mission was completed and the Greensboro Center was inactivated on 15 December 1946. It was declared surplus eight days later. Today, a North Carolina State Historical marker notes the Greensboro Center. It is located west of the intersection of U.S. Route 70 on the south side of East Wendover Avenue in Greensboro. The marker is located at the approximate midpoint of the facility. The facility itself was completely redeveloped in the postwar years, and was incorporated into the city's urban community.

It has been used as a rifle range and a sports field, as well as hosting a brick works. It was the home ground of Durham City football club between 1920 and 1923. History The land originally belonged to the Kepier Hospital, and on the dissolution of the monasteries, it was transferred to William Paget and John Cockburn, who sold it to John Heath in 1555. The land subsequently changed hands a few times, with mining works being established in 1822 and 1872.How family's estate grew out of land omce [sic owned by monks] The Northern Echo 22 October 2004 The site housed a brick works, which remained in use until the 1880s; this was dismantled in the 1890s, leaving only the kiln. The space was then used as a rifle range, with firing posts every 100 yards from a concrete target (also extant). The latter 500 yards of the range were removed in 1920, when Durham City moved to the ground.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p72, The only spectator facility was a wooden seated stand. In 1921 Durham were elected to the Third Division North of the Football League, and the first Football League match played at the ground on 3 September 1921 saw Durham beat Southport 2–0 in front of 3,800 spectators. On 3 December 1921 the ground's record attendance of 7,886 was set for an FA Cup match against Darlington. However, the ground's location some distance from the city centre made it unpopular with supporters, and in 1923 the club relocated to Holiday Park, taking with them the wooden stand. The last League game played at Kepier Haughs was on 5 May 1923 when Durham beat Barrow 4–1 in front of only 1,000 spectators, equalling the lowest recorded attendance at the ground. The remaining 400 yards of the rifle range survived into the 1930s. By 2019, only the concrete frame of the target remained. The site was purchased by the North Eastern Electric Supply Company in the 1940s, with a view to constructing a power station on the site, and on nationalisation ownership was transferred to the British Electricity Authority who disposed of it in the 1950s. The former football ground is now used as a school playing field; the final 400 yards is pasture land. References Category:Defunct football venues in England Category:Durham City A.F.C.

Her experiences are documented in the records of a criminal investigation carried out by the city council of Nördlingen between December 1471 and January 1472. The investigation was first prompted by rumours that Els had become pregnant by a customer, and had subsequently been forced by the brothel madam to terminate her pregnancy by means of a herbal abortifacient. The inquiry later expanded to involve the interrogation of all twelve women working in Nördlingen's brothel in the latter half of 1471, as well as the brothel madam Barbara Tarscheinfeindin and brothel-keeper Lienhart Fryermut. As several of the women in the brothel had left Nördlingen by the time the interrogations began (including Els herself) the investigation also involved cooperation between the authorities in Nördlingen and the city councils of Nuremberg and Weißenburg in Bayern. Original transcriptions of the women's testimony are held today in Nördlingen's civic archive. The case record offers the most comprehensive vision of prostitution currently known to have survived from medieval Europe which shows the perspectives of prostitutes themselves. Els's story has been the subject of several magazine articles, a TV documentary, and a theatrical production, and has been the focus of modern research into prostitution in medieval Europe.  Prostitution in medieval Europe  Public brothels of the kind that Els von Eystett worked in were a common feature in towns across much of western Europe in the period ca. 1350–1550. Although the medieval Church condemned prostitution and saw prostitutes themselves as sinful women, it was generally accepted that tolerating prostitution in society represented a lesser evil than banning it altogether. This position was upheld by a number of major ecclesiastical figures including St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. In southern and central Germany, where public brothels were much more common than in the north, brothels typically operated on a leaseholder model which saw a brothel-keeper (Frauenwirt/in) pay civic authorities for the right to run the brothel. Rules governing the relationship between brothel-keepers and the authorities were set out in lease agreements, and frequently in oaths sworn by brothel-keepers which required them to make promises of loyalty and obedience. These documents frequently also contained 'house rules' specifying the behaviour forbidden in brothels (such as drunkenness and blasphemy) and governing the relations between prostitutes and the brothel-keeper. Prostitutes themselves typically lived in the brothel, and as well as paying for board and lodging were required to give the brothel- keeper a certain amount of the money they received from clients. This usually amounted to one third of their earnings. Most cities permitted brothel-keepers to contract debts with prostitutes or to accept women as pawns, requiring them to pay off debts through their labour. Partly as a consequence of this, prostitutes were often heavily in debt to brothel-keepers, and many were traded between brothels.  The Nördlingen investigations of 1471-2  The transcriptions produced from the testimony of Els von Eystett and the other women of Nördlingen's brothel form the primary source of information about the investigation. Sentencing records for Barbara Tarschenfeindin and Lienhart Fryermut are also held in Nördlingen's civic archive in the city's so-called blood book (Blutbuch), a medieval and early modern record of criminal punishments, and the town's collection of Urfehden, a form of judicial oath. The women's statements indicate that the investigation proceeded along two lines: a specific inquiry into the rumours of Els's abortion, and a more general inquiry into the working conditions in the brothel, ostensibly prompted by Els's claims of other abuses by Barbara and Lienhart. The proceedings were handled by the Nördlingen city council, which in common with other Free Imperial Cities at the time, functioned as both executive and judiciary. Proceedings were made more complex by the fact that three of the women who had witnessed events surrounding the alleged abortion had left Nördlingen by the time the investigation began. Els herself had gone to Weißenburg in Bayern, while Margrette von Biberach and Ursel von Konstanz had both gone to Nuremberg.  Inquiry into working conditions  Proceedings in Nördlingen began with the inquiry into the working conditions in the brothel. Each woman working there at the time of the investigation was first asked a set of questions pertaining to how they had been treated by Lienhart and Barbara, and whether they had experienced specific abuses at their hands. The first witness was named Anna von Ulm, whose testimony supplied the majority of the evidence. Those who followed her were named Adelhait von Sindelfingen, Anna von Schaffhausen, Catrin von Nürnberg, Chündlin von Augsburg, Cristina von der Etsch, Els von Nürnberg, Enndlin von Schaffhausen, Margrette von Biberach, and Wÿchselbrunn von Ulm. Another woman, Ursel von Konstanz, had since left Nördlingen to work in Nuremberg's public brothel; she was therefore interrogated by the Nuremberg city council at the request of the council in Nördlingen, who received a copy of her statement. The women's testimony revealed a widespread pattern of abuse and exploitation at the hands of Lienhart Fryermut and Barbara Tarschenfeindin. This included practices such as forcing the women to work while menstruating; forcing them to work on holy days; denying them the chance to go to church to hear Mass; confiscating their clothes and forcing them to buy items from them at excessive prices; feeding them disgusting food; forcing them to spin cloth to generate extra income; seizing tips given to them by customers and taking more than the permitted one-third cut from their wages. Many of the women said they had routinely suffered violence at Lienhart's hands, and that he sometimes used a bullwhip to beat them. Almost all of the women stated that they were in debt to Lienhart and as a consequence were unable to leave the brothel, notwithstanding the fact that he forbade them to leave the building most of the time.  The abortion inquiry  As well as testifying about working conditions in the brothel, many of the women also described the events surrounding the alleged abortion of Els von Eystett's child, including Els herself. Els claimed in her own statement that she had first complained of abdominal pains to Barbara. Barbara had told her that she was merely suffering from amenorrhea, and stated that she would mix up a drink to bring on menstruation. Having dispatched Anna von Ulm and Margrette von Biberach to fetch ingredients from the market, Barbara then mixed together periwinkle, cloves, carrot (likely to have been daucus carota, a known abortifacient) and strong wine into a hot draught, which, Els claimed, she was forced to drink. Several witnesses including Els, Margrette von Biberach and Anna von Ulm testified that the drink rapidly brought on strong abdominal pains. This caused Els to miscarried a male foetus which Els herself estimated to be twenty weeks old. After her miscarriage Els was forced to return to work, and revealed to at least one customer what had happened to her. After rumours of what had happened had reached the city council, but before the latter had acted, Barbara and Lienhart agreed to release Els from her debts and allow her to leave the brothel, on the condition that she not reveal what had happened; having left Nördlingen, Els subsequently went to Weißenburg in Bayern, where she was eventually tracked down after the investigation was launched in Nördlingen.  Consequences of the investigation  Following the interrogation of the women of Nördlingen's brothel, both Lienhart Fryermut and Barbara Tarschenfeindin were themselves interrogated. Barbara was found guilty of causing the abortion of Els von Eystett's child. Although Nördlingen's town law contained no explicit reference to abortion, convictions of abortion in German-speaking towns in the fifteenth century usually resulted in the expulsion of the guilty party. Barbara was consequently put on the pillory before being branded across the forehead and banished across the Rhine in perpetuity. Lienhart was dismissed from his post as brothel-keeper and forced to swear an oath (the Urfehde) in which he renounced the right to take vengeance and acknowledged his own banishment from the town. In 1472, a new ordinance (Frauenhausordnung) was drawn up for the running of Nördlingen's brothel containing a number of provisions intended to prevent abuses of the kind reported by the women at the investigation. The extent to which these new rules were ever in force is nevertheless doubtful as the ordinance was never bound into the town's collection of statutes. Barbara was consequently put on the pillory before being branded across the forehead and banished across the Rhine in perpetuity. No further historical records pertaining to Els von Eystett survive; after giving her testimony, nothing more is known of her life.

Early life Pumpa grew up in the country, in Cayon Village. He attended Cayon Primary School until the third grade. At the age of nine he relocated to St. Croix US Virgin Islands where he then finished his elementary education at the Lew Muckle Elementary School, and then went to Central High School.  Career  During his freshman and early sophomore years, he sang dancehall and even opened for the “Energy God, Elephant Man.” Although he enjoyed singing dancehall and was good at it, in an island community that is built on soca and calypso it was quite difficult to thrive in that genre of music. He crossed over to the soca side of things with a local band called “Rockin Vybez.” While playing with “Rockin Vybez” he realized that soca/calypso would be the arena in which he would flourish. During the spring of 2003 the birth of a band that set the standard for Crucian soca music took the Virgin Islands region by storm. Angel “A.J.” Ventura, Alvin Burke, Ana “Nina Nyce” Nelson, Dennis “Pumpa” Liburd, Roland “Kurt” Horsford and Wanston formed the “Xtaushun Band.” Together, they used their musical genius to set the standard for others as each collaboration was unparalleled by no other! They considered their style “The Evolution of Soca Music.” They were fresh on the scene and they captured gold by winning their first roadmarch championship with “Energy” a song that was written by Dennis “Pumpa” Liburd and performed by the band. While “Pumpa” used these formative years to usher him into local stardom, he also used them to experiment with new ideas and perfect his raw and natural talent for composing and performing excellent music. It was not before long that he caught the attention of local musician, Alwyn “Daddy Jones” Baptiste Jr. Together they collaborated on a soca album entitled “Daddy Jones Presents” which grabbed the attention of the entire Caribbean. “Moko Jumbie,” a song that talked about Caribbean stilt dancers caught the attention of VP records. “Moko Jumbie” was later released on their “Soca Gold” compilation. Following the release of the “Daddy Jones Presents”, “Pumpa” found it necessary to embark on a yet another chapter of his life. He graduated from the St. Croix Central High School and then ventured on to the Bryant & Stratton College in Syracuse, New York on a full athletic scholarship. He later transferred to Monroe College in New Rochelle, New York and studied Business Administration. While pursuing his undergraduate degree, he continued to pursue his musical career and released his first solo album “Boom Bam Bye”.

SR 354 SR 354 was a state route through central Columbiana County. The route primarily provided access to Guilford Lake to nearby routes. In 1932, an unnumbered state route was created starting near the lake and traveling southeast on mostly dirt roads to US 30 west of Lisbon. The route received its number of SR 354 by 1934. Within one year, it was extended west to the community of New Garden at SR 9. The route existed in this form until 1939 when the entire route became an extension of SR 172, the number the road carries today. SR 355 SR 355 was a short state route in Eaton, Preble County that served the Fort St. Clair State Memorial. The route was created in 1934 when a formerly unnumbered state route received its number. At a length of , the route began at SR 122 west of downtown Eaton, traveled south to the memorial's entrance, went through the site, and ended at itself. The route was removed from the state highway system in the late 1990s after the memorial's jurisdiction was transferred to the city. SR 359 SR 359 was a state route connecting the entrance of Kendall State Park to SR 8, entirely in Boston Township, Summit County. The route was signed in 1934 replacing an unnumbered state-maintained dirt road. The route would not undergo any changes until the mid 1980s when SR 8 was moved off its surface road onto a nearby freeway. The route stopped appearing in the official state map beginning in 1987 but was included within the 1988 Summit County traffic survey report. The entire route is now a part of Summit County Road 187. SR 367 SR 367 was a short state route in Russells Point that existed from 1934 until 1937. The route started at the former SR 32 (later a part of US 33, now SR 366) and traveled north for a short distance. SR 367 served a small community on the shore of Indian Lake. After 1937, the entire route was replaced by SR 708. SR 375 SR 375 was a state route in and in the vicinity of Marietta that existed from 1935 until 1969. The route started at the intersection of Putnam and 3rd Streets; the latter street also carried US 21, US 50 Alternate, and SR 7. The route traveled north out of the city climbing to ridge lines along the hills here. Along its path, it intersected the former state highways SR 326 and SR 351. The route would remain near the tops of these hills except as it approached its northern terminus; the route made several sharp curves to quickly descend a hill to end at US 21. The route was deleted after 1969 which was also around the time I-77 was completed in the city. Today, the parts of the former SR 375 outside of the Marietta city limits are Washington County Road 375. SR 381 SR 381 was a short-lived state highway connecting Greenville and Ansonia in western Darke County. The route was created in 1935 but was replaced after 1936 by SR 118 which was greatly expanded from its former terminus in Rockford. SR 382 SR 382 was a state highway in Portage and Geauga Counties that existed from 1935-1936. The route connected Aurora and US 422 south of the village of South Russell. The route was deleted in 1937 when SR 306 was extended south from its former end in Chesterland. SR 384 SR 384 was a state highway in the northwestern corner of Ohio. When the highway was first created in 1935, the route ran from US 6 east of Edgerton to SR 108 (which became SR 2 within one year) near Williams Center. By 1941, SR 384 was extended east through southern Williams County and northwestern Henry County to end at US 6 near Ridgeville Corners. The route was truncated at its western end to the SR 2 intersection in 1948 since US 6 was rerouted onto the now former section of SR 384. SR 384 would remain on this alignment for the remainder of its time as a state route. The route was deleted in 1957 when US 6 was rerouted out of Bryan and instead traveled on the entire length of the deleted route. SR 386 SR 386 was a short spur route from SR 256 in northwestern Fairfield County. The route, which was long and located in parts of Violet and Liberty Townships, was created in 1935 along a dirt road. Within the next year, the route became a gravel road. The route was deleted in 1937 having been replaced by SR 204. SR 387 SR 387 was a state highway that served as a southern bypass of Sandusky. The route started at an intersection with US 6, State Routes 2, 12, and 101 southwest of the city. Though at first it traveled due south, the route curved to head due east, often forming the border between the city and Perkins Township. Along the way, SR 387 intersected SR 4 and US 250/SR 13. Near the route's end, it turned to the northeast and ended at US 6 east of the city. The route existed from 1935 until 1962 when the state relinquished control of the road. The parts of the former route that sit on the border of Sandusky and Perkins Township are now Erie County Road 5 (known locally as Perkins Avenue). SR 424 SR 424 was the former routing of US 24 along the Maumee River between Defiance in Defiance County to Liberty Township, Henry County by way of Florida and Napoleon. The route was first designated in 1964 through Defiance when US 24 was moved to an expressway bypass north of the city. By 1969, as more of US 24 was moved onto the expressway through northwestern Ohio, SR 424 was extended to its full length of about . The route would remain unchanged until 2008 when all of SR 424 in Defiance County was deleted from the state highway system.News Release, Defiance County Commissioners, Monday, November 10, 2008. Defiance County official website. Retrieved 2009-04-07. In 2012, the remaining portion of SR 424 in Henry County was deleted from the state system. All of the former state route outside of incorporated municipalities are signed as County Road 424. SR 440 SR 440 was the designation for former sections of US 40 which were moved onto nearby completed sections of Interstate 70 in the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1959, two sections of SR 440 existed: from Englewood to Springfield in the western part of the state, and from Kirkersville to Gratiot in the center part of Ohio. In 1962, another segment of the route was designated near St. Clairsville. A fourth separate segment of SR 440 was designated between Zanesville and Norwich by 1964. By 1969, as most of I-70 was completed across the state, all segments of SR 440 were reverted to US 40. SR 504 SR 504 was a short route east of Troy entirely in Staunton Township. It connected SR 70 (now a part of SR 41) and the northern terminus of SR 202 to SR 55. The route was assigned in 1937 and reassigned as the northernmost portion of SR 202 after 1982. SR 509 SR 509 was a state route in northern Wyandot County. The route began in Carey at US 23 on Dow Street, traveled out of the village on North Patterson Street, and traveled along modern-day Wyandot County Roads 5 and 99. SR 509 ended southwest of McCutchenville at SR 53. The route was created in 1937 and was deleted in 1964. SR 512 SR 512 was a state route in Newark that existed from 1937 until 1959. Prior to 1937, SR 16 entered downtown Newark from the west on Granville Street staying to the north of the Raccoon Creek. In 1937, SR 512 was assigned on a straighter route into Newark via Church Street, crossing the creek twice. By 1941, the two routes switch places, SR 512 took the more northerly route into downtown Newark. SR 512 would remain in existence until 1961. SR 522 (1937–1939) SR 522 was the designation for what is now the easternmost of SR 166 in Thompson Township, Geauga County and Trumbull Township, Ashtabula County. The route started in Thompson Township at the intersection of SR 166 (which traveled west and north of this point) and the northern terminus of SR 528 and traveled east to Trumbull Township at SR 534. The route only existed from 1937 until 1939 when it was wholly replaced by SR 166; SR 528 was then extended north along the former SR 166 to North Madison. SR 524 (1937–1941) SR 524 was a north-south state route in the extreme eastern portion of Ashtabula County. The route started in the Williamsfield Township community of Simons at US 322. SR 524 traveled north along the western shore of the Pymatuning Reservoir, never straying more than from the Pennsylvania state line. Along its way, it intersected SR 85 near Andover. The route ended at US 6 on the border of Richmond and Pierpont Townships. SR 524 was created in 1937 along a dirt road and by the time the route was removed from the state highway system in 1941, the route was gravel- paved. SR 526 SR 526 was a state route in the vicinity of Akron and Mogadore. The route, first created in 1937, started in east of downtown Akron at East Market Street (SR 18) and traveled east along Mogadore Road. After passing through Mogadore and intersecting SR 532, the route ended in Suffield Township, Portage County at SR 43. By 1971, the route was truncated at its eastern end to SR 532 in Mogadore. SR 527 (1937–1941) SR 527 was a state route through Summit and a part of Portage County that existed between 1937 and 1941. The route began near Ghent at US 21 and traveled east into the northern extents of Cuyahoga Falls. It also passed through Silver Lake before ending in the northern part of Kent at SR 43. Originally, the entire route was a gravel road but as time progressed, the part of SR 527 between Ghent and SR 8 became downgraded to a dirt road. SR 533 SR 533 was a state route entirely in Jefferson Township, Logan County. The route was a short north- south connector road between SR 540 and SR 47 northeast of Bellefontaine. The state-maintained route was in existence from 1937 until 2014 when the Ohio Department of Transportation and the Logan County Engineer's Office arranged a jurisdiction swap. SR 533 became Logan County Road 5 while portions of County Roads 144 and 144A became an extension of SR 347. SR 538 SR 538 was a state highway entirely in Pierpont Township, Ashtabula County. The route, which existed in 1937 and 1938, connected SR 7 to the Pennsylvania state line where the road continued as PA 198. In 1939, the route became a part of the eastern extension of SR 167. SR 539 (1937–1959) SR 539 was a state route entirely in Manchester Township, Morgan County. The route, also known as Wood Grove Road, connected SR 78 and SR 76 (modern-day SR 83) in the northeast corner of the county. SR 539 was in existence from 1937 until 1959 when the route was replaced by Morgan County Road 27. SR 541 (1937–1942) SR 541 was a state route in the now-defunct Mentor Township, located between Mentor and Painesville. The route, also called Heisley Road, started at US 20 and traveled north to SR 283. SR 541 was a part of the state highway system from 1937 until 1942. In 1963, some of the right-of-way of the old SR 541 became a part of a state highway again as SR 44 was routed along Heisley Road from the newly constructed SR 2 freeway past a new interchange with SR 283 to Headlands Beach State Park. SR 543 SR 543 was a state route in northern Miami and the extreme southern portion of Shelby County. SR 543 served as a shortcut from US 36 between Piqua and Fletcher and US 25 south of Sidney. The route was created in 1937 and was removed by 1961 when US 25 was moved onto a new freeway (I-75) west of its original route. SR 544 SR 544 was a state route in western Sharon Township, Richland County. The short route connected SR 61 and SR 96, though for the first two years of its existence (1937 through 1938), there was no connecting state route at SR 544's northern end; it was a spur to the community of Hines. The route was deleted after 1959. SR 548 SR 548 was a state route Wayne and Medina Counties. Existing from 1937 until 1967, the route started in Mount Eaton at US 250 and SR 241 and traveled through Dalton, Marshallville, and Easton before ending in Wadsworth at SR 94. The route would follow this routing throughout its entire history. Around 1969, numerous state highways were rerouted in Wayne County; as a result of this, SR 94 was routed along the entire length of SR 548 therefore the SR 548 designation was deleted. SR 549 SR 549 was the designation for what is now SR 95 between Mohicanville at SR 89 and SR 3 southwest of Wooster. The route was short-lived, it only existed in 1937 and 1938. By 1939, the entire route became a part of SR 95, the number the road carries today. SR 550 (1937–1946) SR 550 was a state route in Pike County that connected Pebble Township and Waverly. The route existed from 1937 until 1946 and also provided access to the western shore of Lake White and its two associated state routes (Routes 551 and 552). In 1947, SR 220 was extended from its end in Waverly along all of SR 550 to SR 772. The SR 550 designation was therefore deleted. SR 563 SR 563 was a rural state highway in Noble County. The route started near Dexter City at US 21 and traveled west and northwest to its eastern terminus at SR 564 in Enoch Township near Middleburg. The route was in existence from 1937 until 1964 when the entire road's jurisdiction was transferred to Noble County forming Noble County Road 2 (also known as Low Gap Road). SR 567 SR 567 was a state highway that ran near Ohio's northern border with Michigan from 1938 until 1955. The route started at SR 49 in Northwest Township (about from the Ohio-Michigan-Indiana tripoint) and traveled east, first past the northern shoreline of Nettle Lake, then a short jog to the south before heading east again past SR 571 and ending in the village of Pioneer at SR 15. This alignment would be maintained throughout its history. After being deleted from the state highway system, the route became a part of Williams County Road 14. SR 568 SR 568 was a state highway in northern Lucas County that ran near the Michigan state line. The route it utilized for most of its history from 1939 until 1951 started in Sylvania at US 223 and ran east along Alexis Road to US 25 (Detroit Avenue) in Washington Township. For its first year in existence, however, SR 568 was signed west of Sylvania along what became SR 120 by 1940. Beginning in 1947, the route east of SR 183 was co-signed with Bypass US 23-24-25. After 1951, the part of Alexis Road co-signed with the Bypass US Routes became solely designated as that route while the remainder of Alexis Road was removed from the state highway system though by 1964, all of Alexis Road was signed as Bypass US 24–25. Today, all of Alexis Road from its western terminus in Sylvania to I-75 (east of the original eastern terminus at Detroit Avenue) is known as SR 184.

Fraternities and sororities The University Office of Greek Life recognizes thirteen fraternities and eight sororities, which include approximately 25% of the student body. Greek life has been a part of the university culture since 1877, when Beta Theta Pi fraternity became the first to form a chapter on campus. Sororities arrived at Hopkins in 1982. As with all Hopkins programs, Greek discrimination on the basis of \\"marital status, pregnancy, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status\\" is prohibited. JHU also has an anti–hazing policy and prohibits alcohol at recruitment activities. Hopkins does not permit \\"city–wide\\" chapters, and requires all members of a JHU recognized fraternity or sorority to be a JHU student. As of spring 2011, 1,208 students were members of one of Hopkins' fraternities or sororities. The All–Greek Average GPA was 3.31, above the undergraduate average GPA. In spring 2010 the university was considering construction of a \\"fraternity row\\" of houses to consolidate the groups on campus. All Johns Hopkins fraternities and sororities belong to one of four Councils: the Inter–Fraternity Council, the National Panhellenic Conference, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the Multicultural Council. The Inter–Fraternity Council includes twelve fraternities: * ΑΔΦ – Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, chapter founded 1889. * ΑΕΠ – Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, Psi chapter founded 1936. Jewish interest. * ΒΘΠ – Beta Theta Pi fraternity, Alpha Chi chapter founded 1877. * ΛΦΕ – Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity, Upsilon chapter founded 1994. Asian–American interest. * ΦΙΑ – Phi Iota Alpha fraternity, Colony founded 2012. Latino interest. * ΦΔΘ – Phi Delta Theta fraternity, Maryland Delta chapter founded 2009. * ΦΓΔ – Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, Beta Mu chapter founded 1891. * ΦΚΨ – Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, Maryland Alpha chapter founded 1879. * ΠΚΑ – Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Iota Tau chapter founded 1994. * ΣΑΕ – Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Maryland Phi chapter founded 1994. * ΣΧ – Sigma Chi fraternity, Kappa Upsilon chapter founded 2004. * ΣΦΕ – Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Maryland Alpha chapter founded 1929. The National Panhellenic Conference includes five sororities: * ΑΦ – Alpha Phi sorority, Zeta Omicron chapter founded 1982. * ΚΚΓ – Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, Eta Epsilon chapter founded 1999. * ΦΜ – Phi Mu sorority, Gamma Tau chapter founded 1982. * ΠΒΦ – Pi Beta Phi sorority, Maryland Gamma chartered November 20, 2010. * ΚΑΘ – Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Zeta Chi chapter founded April 20, 1997, disbanded April 14, 2009, reorganized March 1, 2014. The National Pan–Hellenic Council includes two historically African–American groups: * ΑΦΑ – Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Sigma Sigma chapter founded 1991. * ΣΓΡ – Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, Rho Omega chapter founded 2009. The Multicultural Council includes four groups: Johns Hopkins University Main Campus at Homewood * αΚΔΦ – alpha Kappa Delta Phi sorority, associate chapter founded 1997. Asian–American interest. * ΔΞΦ – Delta Xi Phi sorority, Lambda chapter founded 2003. Multicultural interest. * ΙΝΔ – Iota Nu Delta fraternity, chapter founded 2008. South Asian interest. * ΣΟΠ – Sigma Omicron Pi sorority, Lambda chapter founded 2002. Asian–American interest. Delta Phi fraternity, also known as St. Elmo's, maintains a chapter exclusive to students at Johns Hopkins, though it is not recognized by the Office of Greek Life. Unrecognized Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta African–American interest sororities often recruit Johns Hopkins undergraduates, in their citywide chapters. Delta Sigma Theta was the first National Pan–Hellenic Council member to charter on the campus in 1976, as well as the first sorority of any kind on the JHU campus. Kappa Alpha Theta, a National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sorority, was disbanded by its national headquarters on April 14, 2009 after twelve years on campus. The removal was due to repeated risk management violations. Theta was reorganized on March 1, 2014. In March 2010, Johns Hopkins University officially opened for NPC extension. In May 2010, the University Panhellenic Council selected Pi Beta Phi, which opened in the fall of 2010. Recruitment for Inter–Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Conference fraternities and sororities takes place during the spring semester for freshmen, though some groups recruit upperclassmen during the fall semester. All participants must have completed one semester and must be in good academic standing. Many of the fraternities maintain houses off campus, but no sororities do. Baltimore City allows housing to be zoned specifically for use as a fraternity or sorority house, but in practice this zoning code has not been awarded for at least 50 years. Only Sigma Phi Epsilon's building has this zoning code due to its consistent ownership since the 1920s.  Honor and Professional Societies  The university is home to a number of professional fraternities, societies, and honor organizations. * ΑΕΔ – Alpha Epsilon Delta pre-med honor society. * ΑΚΨ – Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity, Rho Psi chapter founded 2001. * ΑΦΩ - Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity, Kappa Mu chapter founded 1952 * ΒΒΒ – Beta Beta Beta biology honor society, Rho Phi chapter. * ΛΕΜ – Lambda Epsilon Mu Latino pre-med honor society. * ΝΡΨ – Nu Rho Psi neuroscience honor society. * ΣΙΡ – Sigma Iota Rho international studies honor society. * SHPE – Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. * ΤΒΠ - Tau Beta Pi The Engineering Honor Society. * ΘΤ – Theta Tau engineering fraternity.

The News-Letter won an Associated Collegiate Press Newspaper Pacemaker award for four–year, non–daily college newspapers in 2007. * JHU Politik, founded in 2008 as the University's only bi-partisan political publication, produces a weekly magazine, The Politik Press. The Politik Press contains student written op-eds and interviews with professors, professionals and experts in various political fields. Every semester JHU Politik publishes a special issue to highlight diverse perspectives on singular topics. JHU Politik is also responsible for numerous speakers events on campus as well as more informal discussions and conversations that take place throughout the academic year. * Epidemic Proportions is the university's public health research journal, designed to highlight JHU research and field work in public health. Combining research and scholarship, the journal seeks to capture the breadth and depth of the JHU undergraduate public health experience. * Thoroughfare, Zeniada and j.mag are literary magazines.

Foundations is the undergraduate history journal. * Américas is the Latin American Studies journal. * Argot is the undergraduate anthropology journal. * The Triple Helix is the university's journal to address issues concerning science, law and society. * Perspectives is the official newsletter of the Black Student Union. * The Black & Blue Jay is among the nation's oldest campus humor magazines. It was founded in 1920. According to The Johns Hopkins News–Letter, the magazine's name led the News–Letter to first use the moniker Blue Jays to refer to a Hopkins athletic team in 1923. While the magazine enjoyed popularity among students, it received repeated opposition from the university administration, reportedly for its vulgar humor. In October 1934, Dean Edward R. Berry removed financial support for the magazine; without funding, the magazine continued under the name The Blue Jay until Berry threatened to expel the editors in 1939. The magazine had a revival in 1984, and has appeared intermittently since then. * The Hopkins Donkey was a political newspaper with a Democratic perspective on international, national and statewide political topics. It is now defunct. * The Carrollton Record was a political newspaper with an American conservative perspective on campus and citywide politics. Like the Hopkins Donkey, it is now defunct. Student–Run businesses Hopkins Student Enterprises (HSE) is a venture capital fund and umbrella organization with the goal of fostering innovation and facilitating resources and mentorship to student entrepreneurs. Current businesses that are in operation are as follows: * Hopkins Consulting Agency (HCA)—Business and technology consulting company that prepares technology commercialization reports and business plans. * Hopkins Student Movers (HSM)—Moving and storage company that serves JHU faculty, staff, and students and the broader Baltimore community. * Hopkins Creative Design (HCD)—Full service graphic design company. * The Blue Jay Cleaners - Student janitorial service for all on-campus and select off campus residence halls. * The Complete Dorm Room - Dorm essential delivery service with over 130 items to choose from including everything from linens to printers. * Hop and Shake - Health food kiosk located in the Ralph S.

Programming Boards  In addition to the many clubs that exist on campus, there are a set of groups that run in close conjunction with the Student Leadership and Involvement office to run major activities and events on campus including: * The HOP - The Hopkins Organization for Programming is a group responsible for a continuous stream of on campus events. They also are known to co-sponsor other groups events to help bring other groups visions to life when as the HOP has more resources at their disposal then most groups. Symposiums Established in 1967, the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium is a student-run lecture series at the Johns Hopkins University. Established in 1998, the Foreign Affairs Symposium has hosted a speaker series for the student body, with past speakers including Edward Snowden, Gloria Steinem and Dr. Cornel West. Established in 2018, the Osler Medical Symposium is a student-run speaker series that hopes to bridge the divide between those making decisions in medicine and those affected by these decisions. Notable past symposia include Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore City Commissioner of Health and current President of Planned Parenthood; Dr. Paul B. Rothman, Dean/CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine; Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, former Principal Deputy Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and former Baltimore Commissioner of Health; Dr. Peter Beilenson, former Baltimore City Commissioner of Health and current Sacramento County Commissioner of Health; and Dr. Peter Agre, Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry. Additional student organizations Since 1918, the Johns Hopkins University Barnstormers (originally known as the dramatics club) has been performing various works on campus. In their current set-up they put on five shows a year. Two MainStage productions (a fall play and a spring musical) as well as a spring cabaret, an intersession show and series of one-acts done performed by freshmen. They will be celebrating their 100th anniversary in the 2018-2019 school year.Barnstormers http://www.thejhubarnstormers.org Since 1972, the Johns Hopkins Outdoors Club, or JHOC, has organized weekend trips for students looking to experience the outdoors. Along with Outdoor Pursuits, an arm of the University's Rec Center, JHOC offers students the opportunity to participate in activities such as canoeing, kayaking, caving, and mountain biking. The Johns Hopkins Student Government Association represents undergraduates in campus issues and projects. It is elected annually. Blueprints for a new programming board called The Hopkins Organization for Programming (\\"The HOP\\") were drawn up during the summer and fall of 2006.

Coronary artery ectasia is characterized by the enlargement of a coronary artery to 1.5 times or more than its normal diameter.Lin, C.T., Chen, C.W., Lin, T.W., and Lin, C.L (2008) Coronary artery ectasia, Tzu Chi Med, 20(14), 270-274 The disease is commonly asymptomatic and is normally discovered when performing tests for other conditions such as coronary artery disease, stable angina and other acute coronary syndromes.Hsu, P.C., Su, H.M., Lee, H.C., Juo, S.H., Lin, T.H., Voon, W.C., Lai, W.T., and Sheu, S.H.(2014)Coronary artery collateral circulation in patients of coronary ectasia with significant coronary artery disease.PLOS ONE,9(1), doi: 10.13.71Antoniadia, A.P., Chatzizisis, Y.S., and Giamoglou, G.P. (2008) Pathogenic mechanisms of coronary ectasia. Int J Cardio, 130, 335-343 Coronary artery ectasia occurs 4 times more frequently in males than in females and in people who have risk factors for heart disease such as smokers.Hartnell, G.G., Parnell, B.M. and Pridie, R.B. (1985) Coronary artery ectasia: its prevalence and clinical significance in 4993 patients. Br Heart J, 54, 392-405Li, J., Nie, S., Qian, X., Zeng, H., and Zhang, C. (2009) Chronic inflammatory status in patients with coronary artery ectasia. Cytokine, 46, 61-64 While the disease is commonly found in patients with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, it can occur by itself and in both cases it can cause health problems. The disease can cause the heart tissue to be deprived of blood and die due to decreased blood flow, and blockages due to blood clots or spasms of the blood vessel. This blood flow disruption can cause permanent damage to the muscle if the deprivation is prolonged. Coronary artery ectasia also increases the chance of developing large weak spots in the affected coronary arteries, or aneurysms that can rupture and result in death. The damage can result in angina which is pain in the chest and is a common complaint in these patients. Pathology Coronary artery ectasia is commonly found in patients with diseases of the connective tissue and an increased inflammatory response such as Marfan syndrome and Kawasaki Disease.Sayn, T., Doven, O., Berkalp, B., Akyurek, O., Gulec, S. and Oral, D. (2001) Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery ectasia without obstructive coronary artery disease. ‘’Inter J Cardio’’, 78,143-149 It can also be found transiently in patients that have undergone stent placement resulting in the stretching of the vessels 1. Coronary artery ectasia is characterized by an increased wall stress of the vessel, thinning of the arterial wall which causes progressive dilation and remodelling of the vessel. The permanent dilation of the artery is thought to be mainly caused by inflammation, triggered by disease, chemicals, or physical stress of the vessel. The inflammatory response results in an over expression of matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine proteinases, and serine proteinases that causes the partial breakdown of the vessel and weakens it.Theodoros, A., Korovesis, S., Giazitzoglou, E., Kokladi, M., Venetsanakos, I., Paxinos, G., Fragakis, N.and Katritsis, D. (2013) Clinical and angiographic characteristics of patients with coronary artery ectasia. Int J Cardio, 167, 1536-1541 The inflammation response will also trigger platelet activation which increases the risk of blood clots. The risk of blood clots will increase due to the turbulent blood flow of the enlarged vessel which can activate platelets and form clots.Varol, E., Uysal, B, A., Dogan, A., Ozaydin, M. and Erodogan, D. (2012) Mean platelet volume as a prognostic value in patients with coronary artery ectasia. Clin Appl Thromb-Hema,18(4), 387-392 Inflammation elevated oxidative stress is increased, and antioxidant activity is depressed in coronary artery ectasia. This imbalance can cause damage to the cells and cause them to die, weakening the vessels further.Sezen, Y., Bas, M., Polat, M., Yildiz, A., Buyukhatipoglu, H., Kucukdurmaz, Z., Kaya, Z. and Demirbag, R. (2010) The relationship between oxidative stress and coronary artery ectasia. Cardio J, 17(5), 488-494 The activation of the inflammatory response causes a detectable increase in C reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and cell adhesion molecules, which can be used as a diagnostic marker,. Diagnosis To discover the extent and severity of coronary artery ectasia there are a variety of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray.Aydn, M., Texn, I.O., Dogan, S.M., Yildirum, N., Arasli, M., Sayn, M. and Aktop, Z.(2009)The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in patients with isolated coronary artery ectasia.Mediat Inflamm.Doi:10.1155/2009/106/145 Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery.Lin, C.T., Chen, C.W., Lin, T.W., and Lin, C.L (2008) Coronary artery ectasia, Tzu Chi Med 20(14), 270-274 Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1¬→diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2¬→ diffuse disease in 1 vessel and local disease in another, Type 3¬→ diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4¬→ localized or segmental ectasia. Treatment The treatment of coronary artery ectasia is normally done in conjunction with therapies of other heart disorders such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. To prevent the formation of blood clots and the blockage of the vessels, patients are commonly placed on anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin, and aspirin), as well as anti-spasm therapy of calcium channel blockers. Coronary artery ectasia also responds to statins and ACE inhibitors.[reference needed]  References  Category:Heart diseases ","title":"Coronary artery ectasia"},{"id":"42344515","text":"James Ellis (27 May 1867 – 16 April 1939) was a Scottish footballer who played as an inside right for Mossend Swifts, Third Lanark and Leith Athletic.

Life  =Education= His father was a brewer and he grew up in a part of the city that largely retained its Medieval character.Hans Lohne: Frankfurt um 1850. Nach Aquarellen und Beschreibungen von Carl Theodor Reiffenstein und dem Malerischen Plan von Friedrich Wilhelm Delkeskamp. Verlag Waldemar Kramer, Frankfurt am Main 1967, , S. 64 His father wanted Carl to take his place as proprietor of the family tavern, but Carl displayed a precocious interest in art, so a live-in drawing tutor was obtained. In 1828, he and his teacher took a trip around Hofheim, Lorsbach and Eppstein. Reiffenstein would later declare that trip to be the most important factor in determining the direction of his career. By 1830, he was already sufficiently advanced to gain paid employment, hand coloring lithographs and prints. He continued his studies with several other teachers and taught himself from books. At the age of thirteen, with his father's permission, he enrolled at the Städelschule under Friedrich Maximilian Hessemer. Initially, he planned to become an architect but found that he was more interested in Hessemer's architectural drawings so he switched to painting, with Heinrich von Rustige as instructor. When he left the school in 1846, he engaged in several study trips, ranging from Paris to Bohemia and Italy. Tuchgaden (1862) =Career= He soon achieved great success as a painter and, in 1858, became a corresponding member of the \\"Cercle Artistique\\" in Ghent. He was awarded the Medal for Art at the World Exposition, Vienna, in 1873. His evocative landscapes earned him the nickname \\"Malenden Dichters\\" (The Painting Poet). Many of his commissions came from the Rhein-Main region, but he also received an order from Amorbach destined for Queen Victoria in memory of her step- brother, Prince Karl von Leiningen. For many years, he was a board member of the \\"Vereins für Geschichte und Altertumskunde\\" (Association for History and Archaeology) in his hometown. In this capacity, he was involved in the effort to preserve the Goethe House, acting as treasurer for donations and contributions and instrumental in arranging its purchase by the \\"Freie Deutsche Hochstift\\" in 1863. In 1867, he married the daughter of a wine merchant. The marriage was childless, and his wife acted as a sort of secretary, organizing and cataloguing his works. After his wife's death in 1892, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed his right side. When he appeared to be recovering, he came down with a kidney ailment, then influenza. He died near the end of 1893 and was buried in the Hauptfriedhof. A Plaza in Frankfurt has been named after him.  Work  St.John's Church (1871). A reconstruction of the way it would have appeared in 1845. It is difficult to make a full assessment of his surviving works, as they are widely dispersed in private collections. His known works number over 2,000 (mostly watercolors). It is estimated that if one includes study sheets, sketches etc., that the number would exceed 10,000. The Städelschule alone possesses forty-three volumes of study sheets. As early as the 1830s, the character of the Altstadt in Frankfurt had begun to change, largely due to what were intended as hygienic improvements. Beginning in the 1850s, he would wander through the area making sketches; sometimes only days before the buildings were razed to make way for new structures or streets. When he was too late, he would make use of every possible resource to reconstruct the scene. He compiled a seven volume work with over 1,600 images and 2,600 pages of extensive notes on architectural details, suspected changes, owners and the age of buildings throughout the Altstadt. These volumes were bequeathed to the Historical Museum and have yet to be fully published, although many of the images have been used; notably in an edition of Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit.

A well known supporter of Ajax, Sven was a key member of the F-side, a hooligan firm associated with the club from Amsterdam. In 1997 he was commissioned by AFC Ajax N.V. and with permission of the Amsterdam Arena, together with fellow writers DELTA, OASE, RHYME and GASP to create a graffiti mural dedicated to the club. The mural has been situated behind the goal line along the south-end of the Stadium where the F-side are situated ever since. HIGH also started a clothing line for his own designs dedicated to hooliganism and Ajax, initially starting by creating T-shirts, he soon expanded into all areas of fashion, to footwear and eventually accessories. He funded his A.F.C.A brand with the success of his company Ticketbureau Ticket Unlimited, an important vendor for tickets to concerts and sporting events in the Netherlands. He also opened an official A.F.C.A store in the neighborhood of Hoogoorddreef (Zuidoost). Known in the Netherlands for his involvement in several criminal cases, some which were never resolved, with most cases revolving around graffiti, drug trafficking and his activity as a hooligan since the mid-eighties. He was no stranger to trouble, and his A.F.C.A store was eventually set on fire in 2009. On 12 August 2011 Sven was gunned down in front of his house on Borgloonstraat in the neighborhood of Slotervaart (Nieuw-West) by a man on a scooter. He was then kept in an artificial coma in hope that he would recover from his injuries. On 17 August 2011, the doctors who were treating Sven for his gunshot wounds pulled the plug on his life support. He was survived by a daughter. On 18 November 2011 it was announced that Rick Halman was the prime suspect in the murder of Sven Westendorp, who was then finally caught and arrested on 20 April 2012. American hip-hop and Street culture magazine Complex Magazine, listed HIGH as the 9th most influential graffiti artist in their Top 25 Graffiti writers from Amsterdam article in December 2011.

Tenenbaum (born 1945) is an American linguist, anthropologist and artist specializing in metalsmithing and jewelry. She is equally well known for her documentation of the Dena’ina language as for her jewelry pieces which tell the stories of Alaska native peoples and landscape.  Life and early influences  Tenenbaum discovered jewelry making at the age of 13 while in the ninth grade. She studied Romance languages and Anthropology and received her B.A. from the University of Michigan. She attended graduate school in Anthropology and Linguistics and received her Ph.D. from Columbia University. Research for her dissertation took her to Nondalton, a small village in rural Alaska where she lived for two years in order to document the Dena’ina language. In the succeeding two years she wrote a grammar of the Dena’ina verb for her dissertation, Morphology and Semantics of the Tanaina Verb, and compiled a preliminary dictionary of the endangered language. She also translated and compiled 24 stories which she had recorded and transcribed in Nondalton, for her book Dena’ina Sukdu’a: Traditional Stories of the Tanaina Athabaskans, first published in 1976. Both the dissertation and the collection of Dena’ina stories are still regarded by linguists today as among the finest in the field. After completing her Ph.D. Tenenbaum lived with Yup’ik and Iñupiat peoples in several other Alaskan villages, teaching and coordinating rural delivery programs for the University of Alaska, among them the X-CED Program. During all these years, she continued to make jewelry and never gave up her dream to one day be a full-time artist. In 1982 Tenenbaum changed directions and began to devote herself to her jewelry making career, studying with a personal mentor, and pursuing classes, challenging herself to master the most difficult techniques. In time, the life-changing experiences of being welcomed and loved by Alaskan village communities began to surface in her jewelry work. Additionally, she has continued to go back to Alaska and visit the peoples she lived with. What has resulted is a synthesis of an Anthropologist's perspective with a lifelong dedication to the art of jewelry making. Over the years, as her understanding of these cultures and the landscape they inhabit deepened and her technical goldsmithing vocabulary expanded, Tenenbaum's jewelry work has become more complex, more subtle and the bearer of increasingly deeper meaning regarding our connection to the earth. Her work is entirely hand fabricated using precious metals, gemstones, cloisonné enameling, and a wide range of metalsmithing and goldsmithing techniques. Her pieces tell stories and paint pictures of the peoples with whom she lived, of how we interact with our environment, and of places of transcendent beauty. These pieces are wearable miniature landscapes having both cultural themes and ecological messages.

On September 25th, 1874, 352 Icelanders, exhausted and weakened by illness arrived at the emigration sheds in Toronto. When the Victoria Railway Company offered work constructing its line from near Kinmount, the provincial government housed the Icelanders in log shanties down river from here. Poor ventilation, sanitation and diet allowed sickness to rage through their cold, over-crowded quarters. Within six weeks, twelve children and a teenager had died. By the spring of 1875, the death toll had doubled and many of the settlers scattered in search of a better life. In the fall, most regrouped in Toronto and travelled west to found the settlement of Gimli, Manitoba.\\" Additional plaques include this text in Icelandic and French.

On 19 November 2018, S14 and fellow Ukrainian nationalist political organizations—the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Right Sector—endorsed Ruslan Koshulynskyi candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. In the election Koshulynskyi received 1.6% of the votes.Zelenskiy wins first round but that’s not the surprise, Atlantic Council (4 April 2019) Group image S14 (as spelled in the Ukrainian alphabet) just resembles the word Sich () – the name given to the administrative and military centres for Cossacks in the 16–18th century.. But this statement is being denied by the news organization and the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium who have reported that the number 14 in the group’s name has been seen as a reference to a 14-word slogan coined by American white-supremacist David Lane. S14 leader has repeatedly defended himself from attacks calling him a Nazi. According to him his main \\"confrontations\\" were with \\"non- Ukrainian ethnic groups that controlled Ukraine's political and economic forces\\" (Karas identified Russians and Jews). (According to him) \\"We don’t consider ourselves a neo-Nazi organization, we’re clearly Ukrainian nationalists.\\" In May 2018 Hromadske.TV stated \\"Most of C14's actions do seem to be directed at Russia, or those sympathetic towards Russia\\". German political scientist Andreas Umland on the other hand claimed (also in May 2018) that S14 \\"could qualify as neo-Nazi.\\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported in June 2018 that members of the group had openly expressed neo-Nazi views. In 2017, S14 was accused by left-wing anti-war activist Stas Serhiyenko of having been involved in his stabbing. The day after the attack S14 leader Karas accused Serhiyenko of having supported the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Kharkiv and the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and claimed that the attack was \\"far from the first, but not the last, attack on the bacilli of terrorism, hidden in the midst of peaceful Ukrainian streets\\". In June 2018, S14 gained international notoriety after reports it was being involved in violent attacks on Romani camps. After one such alleged attack in May 2018, Kyiv Police released a statement it had not receive complaints from Roma for beatings nor violence. S14 itself states that it does only use \\"compelling legitimate arguments\\" to remove illegal Romani camps.

Frederick George H. Williams (January 13, 1863 in Clapham, London, United Kingdom - June 16, 1944 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was an English–Canadian journalist, writer, and historian. Background Fred Williams was the son of the respected war correspondent and journalist Charles Frederick Williams, and of Georgina Gould Ward. Career =Newspaper= Fred Williams began his newspaper career in January 1882 at the age of 19 serving first at the Montreal Herald and later at the Montreal Gazette. His career in journalism would span more than sixty years. He also served The Montreal Star, The Toronto News, The Ottawa Free Press, The Victoria Colonist, The Vancouver Sun, The Toronto Mail and Empire, and The Globe and Mail. He went to Australia as a reporter from 1893–1896. He served as a city editor, telegraph editor, news editor, editorial writer as well as a reporter. He became a freelance writer in 1918 with a syndicated column on Canadian history. Williams also covered Canadian federal politics as a member of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery in Ottawa for 25 years and served on its executive. He knew Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and all the eminent men who were their colleagues and successors. On June 6, 1891, Williams was the reporter on duty who was first reported the death of Prime Minister MacDonald. The two greatest speeches he ever heard were both by Canadian Prime Minister Laurier given in the Canadian Parliament. The first was a tribute to Prime Minister MacDonald on the occasion of his death. The second was in praise of Queen Victoria following her death in 1901. His work in the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery was recognized as he left the Ottawa Free Press for British Columbia in 1912 at a farewell party that included an engraved gold handled silk umbrella and valuable case of pipes. By the end of his career in journalism that spanned 62 years, he was referred to as the \\"grand old man of journalism.\\" =Canadian history= The 1934 Canadian 10-cent stamp featuring the 150th anniversary of the United Empire Loyalists being established in Canada. One of his contributions to a popular understanding of Canadian history was his regular series of articles reviewing events that occurred on particular dates in Canada's story. Through these articles, he was said to have done more than any other individual to make Canadians \\"history conscious\\" through his care to provide an authentic and accurate portrayal of events. The series first began with the Toronto Mail and Empire newspaper with a daily feature entitled \\"Do You Know?\\" This series was eventually syndicated and quoted across the continent. The Montreal Gazette remarked, \\"Day by day Mr. Williams delves into the history of this country bringing to light finer details of the past than our present histories contain. He goes into the byways of forgotten places, breathes life into the character of an earlier age and keeps before us historical dates we are too apt to forget.\\" He also had a syndicated column through the Toronto Daily Star known as \\"Lest We Forget\\" that also recounted Canadian history. Williams gave historical talks to encourage an appreciation of Canadian history and was enjoyed as a speaker. In 1934, a Canadian 10-cent stamp featuring the 150th anniversary of the United Empire Loyalists being established in Canada was the result of William's suggestion. Williams was referred to as \\"the brilliant Ontario historian.\\" This stamp was awarded fourth place among the postage stamp designs of 1934 by a world consensus of philatelists. Currently, his article on the death of John Crooks of the War of 1812 is featured on the Ontario War of 1812 history website. =Author= Williams and his wife Aley Mary Shonfeld Williams co-authored The Canadian Book of Days in 1924. =Others= Williams also served as a gunner with the Montreal Garrison Artillery that was sent in 1885 to combat the Northwest Rebellion in Manitoba. He fought in the battles of Fish Creek, Cut Knife, and Batoche. He received the North West Canada Medal for his service. Their trip constituted the first passenger train trip from Montreal to Winnipeg. Fred Williams first learned of the death of his father, Charles Williams, the famous war correspondent, on the wire service he was monitoring at his newspaper in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\"The late Mr. Charles Williams.\\" Coleraine Constitution and Northern Counties Advertiser, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, 27 February 1904. Death Williams died on June 16, 1944 at his home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the age of 81. The funeral was held at St. James Cathedral in Toronto and was led by the Dean of Toronto and rector, C. E. Riley. In attendance at the funeral of Fred Williams were the leading publishers and journalists of Canada. Among the honorary pallbearers were J.E. Atkinson, Main Johnson and Russell Fox of The Toronto Star; George McCullagh, Hector Charlesworth, J. V. McAree and A. A. McIntosh of The Globe and Mail, C. O. Knowles of the Evening Telegram; B. K.

The murder Forsyth, a road worker, and Harris, an unemployed driver, were part of a gang which also included Christopher Louis Darby (aged 20, a coalman) and Terence Lutt (aged 17, an unemployed labourer). On the night of 25 June 1960, at about 11.17 p.m., they set upon 23-year-old engineer Allan Jee on a footpath at the bottom of James Street, Hounslow, Middlesex, kicking him unconscious while attempting to relieve him of his money (a ten-shilling note which was all the money Jee had on him was missed) and leaving him bleeding from head injuries. Jee, who had been walking home after an evening with his fiancée, Jacqueline Herbert, was about 20 yards from his home when he was attacked; he had become engaged on the previous day. He suffered a fractured skull during the attack and died from his injuries two days later at the West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, having suffered a cerebral contusion.Link to Capital Punishment UK website A witness, Anthony Cowell, who was standing at the other end of James Street, was able to give police a detailed description of four young men running from the scene of the crime; it was a friend of Forsyth's, Kevin Cullinan, who informed the police on 18 July 1960 that Forsyth had been boasting about his part in the attack. Furthermore, he gave the police the names of three young men - Harris, Darby and Lutt - whom he had seen with Forsyth in a coffee bar on the night of the attack. The four young men were arrested two days later; in the course of the police investigation into the murder, traces of Jee's blood were found on Forsyth's ‘winkle-picker’ shoes and trousers. At the time of the murder, Forsyth was on bail for having assaulted two police officers at Heathrow Airport and had been detained in an Approved School. The trial It became clear at the subsequent trial at the Old Bailey that Lutt had been the one to strike the first blow upon Jee but that the kicking had been administered by Forsyth. Only Darby claimed to have used no violence upon Jee; for that reason, the charge against him was reduced to one of non-capital murder. Pathologist Dr. Donald Teare testified that Jee had been kicked five times in the head by the gang. Three of the gang - Forsyth, Harris and Lutt - were found guilty of capital murder. Both Forsyth and Harris were sentenced to death by Mr Justice Winn on 26 September 1960 under the 1957 Homicide Act, which defined murder in the course of robbery as a capital crime (although nothing had actually been taken in the course of the assault). As a minor, Lutt was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure (he would serve 10 years), while Darby was found guilty of non- capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Execution The appeals of both Forsyth and Harris were dismissed in October 1960. A petition for clemency containing around 3,000 names, including such prominent names as The Earl of Harewood, Donald Soper, Gilbert Harding, Kingsley Amis and J. B. Priestley, was turned down on 8 November 1960. The executions took place two days later, at 9 a.m. Forsyth was given a ’drop’ of seven feet and two inches. Forsyth – whose girlfriend Margaret Caitlin (he claimed) was expecting his child in January 1961Article on Murder In Notting Hill website \\\\- was the last 18-year-old to be hanged in Britain (the last teenager to be executed in Britain - 19-year-old Anthony Miller - was hanged in Glasgow just over a month later, on 22 December 1960). Only three other eighteen-year-olds were executed in Britain in the 20th century (Henry Julius Jacoby in 1922, Arthur Bishop in 1925 and German POW Armin Kuhne in 1945); the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 fixed the minimum age for a prisoner to be hanged at 18 years. =Victor Terry= On the morning of 10 November, 20-year-old Victor Terry, a friend of Forsyth's, heard about the executions on his car radio. One hour later, he shot dead a security guard at a bank in Worthing, West Sussex in the course of a robbery. Terry was to claim at his subsequent trial that he was possessed by the spirit of the American gangster 'Legs' Diamond. He was found guilty of capital murder and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 25 May 1961, on the same gallows upon which Forsyth had been executed just over six months earlier.Article on Old Police Cells Museum website Bibliography * John J.

The P50 response is used to measure sensory gating, or the reduced neurophysiological response to redundant stimuli. Research has found an abnormal P50 suppression in people with schizophrenia, making it an example of a biological marker for the disorder. Besides schizophrenia, abnormal P50 suppression has been found in patients with traumatic brain injury, recreational drug use, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Paired click test In a paired click test, one auditory click sound will be presented, followed by a second click approximately 500 ms after the first one. The second sound is considered redundant, and so a typical control showing normal sensory gating will produce a reduced response (in wave amplitude) to the second click. The suppression is measured as the percentage of amplitude decrease in response to the second click compared to the first click, with typical controls showing an approximately 80% decrease to the second stimulus. This response is recorded at the scalp and represents a pre-attentive process of sensory gating. Development Healthy infants as young as 1 to 4 months old were found to demonstrate a P50 suppression in a paired click task, suggesting that sensory gating is present early in development. Suppression deficits in schizophrenics Studies have found that patients with schizophrenia fail to show a reduced response to the second click. Abnormal sensory gating may be behind symptoms of schizophrenia such as sensory overload and difficulty concentrating. A link exists between abnormal α7 receptors and the abnormal P50 response. In a family that has a child with schizophrenia, at least one of the parents tends to show higher rates of abnormal P50 gating compared to normal controls even when the parents themselves do not have schizophrenia. Abnormal P50 suppression in paired click tests can be found through either a failure to suppress the second stimulus, or as a failure to produce a heightened response to the first stimulus. Some studies suggest that P50 suppression in people with schizophrenia might instead appear as a smaller response to the first auditory stimulus.

A week prior to this episode's release, it was announced by ABC Studios that the series was canceled.

Upon airing, the finale was watched by 3.38 million American viewers and attained an 18-49 rating of 0.9, marking an increase in viewers from the previous episode, but a slight decrease in 18-49 ratings. Commentators also gave the finale generally positive reviews. Plot =Opening sequence= The White Rabbit is seen in the forest. =In Wonderland= Jafar and Amara successfully breaks the laws of magic, becoming the two most powerful sorcerers in all the realms. However, despite this, Jafar refuses to share the title with Amara and tries to kill her as Amara attempts to heal Cyrus. Jafar is interrupted by his father, who wants nothing but the madness to end. Wanting to get the love he never got from his father, Jafar uses his magic on his father to love him and then coldly kills him. Amara and Alice uses this commotion to flee the castle with Cyrus on a magic carpet. They seek refuge at the White Rabbit's home, where Amara heals Cyrus. Alice hatches a plan with Cyrus, Amara, and the White Rabbit to defeat Jafar and they part ways in two teams; Alice and the White Rabbit to find people to help fight Jafar while Amara and Cyrus heads to the Well of Wonders to return the magical waters to Nyx to undo Jafar's spell. Jafar raises the dead and commands them to hunt down and kill Alice, Cyrus, and Amara. He also resurrects Anastasia, who is under the impression that she is Jafar's lover. Alice and the White Rabbit, once gathered some men and women, fights against Jafar's undead army, and Alice is promptly captured and taken to the castle. Jafar interrogates Alice to learn Amara's whereabouts and learns about their plan involving Nyx and the Well of Wonders. With Anastasia's help, Jafar heads over to eliminate Amara. Upon reaching the doorway to the Well of Wonders, Amara and Cyrus is ambushed by the undead army. Using her magic, Amara kills them and proceeds to sacrifice herself to Nyx as Jafar confronts them. In the mid of this, Alice and the White Rabbit ambushes Jafar. As Amara slowly condensers into water, Jafar steals the water before it could be fully returned to Nyx. Believing that he defeated Alice and Cyrus, Nyx, angered that he stole her waters without her permission, curses Jafar into a genie and his genie bottle is scattered to another realm. Once Jafar is defeated, his wrongdoings are undone; Will, Taj, and Rafi is freed from their genie imprisonment, and Anastasia remains dead. However, Nyx believes that while the Red Queen was meant to move on, Anastasia's path lives on and instead she gifts Alice and Cyrus her waters to awake Anastasia. Will, upon Anastasia dying again, griefs her death once again. When Alice and Cyrus returns to the castle, they gives Nyx's waters to Anastasia which awakens her. She reunites with Will as Cyrus reunites with his brothers. With nothing left to lose, Alice suggests that they return to Victorian England for their marriage. With the White Rabbit's help, Alice and Cyrus returns home. =In Victorian England= After sometime after returning home, Alice prepares to wed Cyrus. On her wedding day, her father Edwin apologies for never believing in her tales of Wonderland. He walks her down the aisle while their guests: Sarah, Millie, Anastasia, Will, Taj, Rafi, Mrs. Rabbit, and Tweedledum looks on. After reaching the end of the aisle, as Alice and Cyrus is together, the White Rabbit officiates the wedding by talking about how Alice and Cyrus have stayed by each other through thick and thin and officially pronounce them as husband and wife. After the ceremony, Alice and Cyrus bids farewell to their friends as the White Rabbit sends everyone back home via his portal. Many years later, while having tea with Cyrus in the garden of their home, Alice tells her tales of Wonderland to her daughter, noting that Anastasia and Will had become the White Queen and King of Wonderland as the White Rabbit looks on the happy family. Production Executive producers and creators of the series Adam Horowitz, Edward Kitsis, and Zack Estrin wrote this episode; while Kari Skogland directed it. On 28 March 2014 -- a week prior to the episode's release -- it was revealed that the series would be ending. Despite the show's cancellation, Edward Kitsis said prior to the show's premiere \\"We really want to tell the story without having to worry about how to stretch it for five years. This is not meant to be a 22-episode season. Whatever it ends up being, we'll have told a complete story ...\\" It was revealed in August 2013 at the TCA Summer Press Tour that, contrary to previous reports that more than 13 episodes were ordered straight out the gate, only the usual amount of 13 episodes had been ordered. Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz commented \\"However many we wind up doing this season, what we're planning to do is tell a kind of complete tale with a beginning, middle and end\\" and added \\"If it does well [and] people like it, hopefully we'll come back and tell another adventure with this cast.\\" Prior to and after the show's cancellation, questions rose about whether the characters would be featured in the parent series, with the ABC president Paul Lee suggesting that Horowitz and Kitsis will \\"weave storylines across their assets.\\" Reception =Ratings= The finale was watched by 3.38 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 0.9/3. Though the viewership improved slightly from the previous episode, the 18-49 rating decreased. The show placed third in its timeslot and fourteenth for the night. =Critical reception= The finale received generally positive reviews from critics. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode an 8.9 out of 10, saying \\"The series finale was emotionally satisfying and worthy of the characters and their stories. Though there is always room for improvement, it delivered what it needed to. It's unfortunate we won’t get more time with these characters in this setting.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 out of 5, signaling positive reviews. Lily Sparks of TV.com gave the episode (and the season) a mixed review, saying \\"Thanks to this finale, Wonderland's future fans will have an emotionally satisfying, classic happy ending to look forward to at the end of the rusty laser-tag game that was the season—an ending so complete and composed that I’m sure the production team had a big heads-up they wouldn't be getting a second season well before they wrote the finale script. No storylines were left unsewn, there was no signature Kitsis & Horowitz cliffhanger; instead, we saw a very All’s Well That End’s Well, every-character-reunited wedding, presided over by a CGI rabbit, no less.\\" References External links  Category:2014 American television episodes Category:American television series finales Category:Once Upon a Time in Wonderland episodes ","title":"And They Lived..."},{"id":"42344979","text":"The Sugarplastic is an alternative rock band founded in Los Angeles, California in 1989. History Founding members Ben Eshbach and Kiara Geller met in the late 1980s. Geller, who was still learning to play bass at the time, was impressed by Eshbach's guitar playing and encouraged him to form a band.http://sugarplastic.com/biography.html The two bonded over similar tastes in music and began jamming informally with drummer Josh Laner in December 1989. The trio rehearsed in a local appliance store owned by Laner's father and went through a multitude of names before finally settling on The Sugarplastic. After failing to find a suitable lead singer, the band played only instrumentals for its first year of existence until Eshbach stepped up to sing. In 1991, the band recorded a demo tape and began performing live around Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, the band gained attention and was asked by Pronto Records to release an EP of original material. \\"Ottawa Bonesaw\\", a collection of six singles, was released in 1993, followed by two more singles released by indie label Small-Fi. The band entered the studio along with engineer Casey Neiditch to begin recording their debut full-length album Radio Jejune. During the sessions, they were approached by Geffen Records and agreed to sign on the condition that \\"Radio Jejune\\" be released by their current label, Sugarfix Records. Their major-label debut, \\"Bang, the Earth is Round\\" followed in 1996 and was produced by Ben Eshbach. The single \\"Polly Brown\\" was sent to radio, though it garnered little airplay. For their next album, the band chose to work with producer Andy Metcalfe, formerly of Squeeze and The Soft Boys. The sessions were drawn out by the departure of drummer Josh Laner and a contract renegotiation that allowed the band to be released from Geffen. Furthermore, the band wished to take their time in assembling a coherent collection of songs as their first two albums had only compiled material written at different times. Pat Mastelotto provided drums and percussion on two early tracks. David Cunningham, a long-time friend of Eshbach's, soon replaced Laner on drums as a full-time member. The band's third album, \\"Resin\\", was finally released in 2000. The song \\"Don't Look Down\\" was recorded for The Powerpuff Girls in 2001. For their fourth album, the band chose to release an A-side/B-side single every three months for a two-year period, culminating in \\"7x7x7\\", a full-length collection containing all seven singles.http://idiot-dog.com/music/sugarplastic/indexs.html Their fifth and latest album, \\"Will\\", was released in 2005. The title is dedicated to William Glenn, a former engineer and friend of the band who died four years prior.

Plot  At the age of thirty Carlo is a chronic and complex boy, in full existential crisis, left by his wife for a more mature and self-confident man, and fired from a job he has never loved. Having reached the limit of endurance, he decides to change scenery for a while and, accepting the invitation of his historic friend Massimo, he leaves Rome to spend a few weeks in Venice, the city where man has rebuilt his life. Massimo also has a bankruptcy story behind him, from which his 11-year-old daughter Giulia was born. Carlo has not seen his friend's daughter for some years, and when he meets Giulia for the first time, he is strangely struck. Even the girl immediately shows a strong sympathy towards her father's young friend, with a very different character compared to the adults she knows. The time spent in the lagoon soon leads Carlo to forget his ex-girlfriend, while the commitments of his parents mean that Giulia ends up spending most of her days in the company of Carlo: his adolescent soul, sometimes childish, and the character of her, a decidedly precocious child compared to her young age, means that between the two there is an unforeseeable \\"love at first sight\\".

The steering- column levers control ignition timing (left) and the throttle (right). The large hand-levers set the rear-wheel parking brake and put the transmission in neutral (left) and control an after-market 2-speed transmission adapter (right). Car controls are the components in automobiles and other powered road vehicles, such as trucks and buses, used for driving and parking. While controls like steering wheels and pedals have existed since the invention of cars, other controls have developed and adapted to the demands of drivers. For example, manual transmissions became less common as technology relating to semi-automatic and automatic transmissions advanced. Earlier versions of headlights and signal lights were fueled by acetylene or oil. Acetylene was preferred to oil, because its flame is resistant to both wind and rain. Acetylene headlights, which gave a strong green-tinted light, were popular until after World War I; even though the first electric headlights were introduced in 1898 (and those were battery-powered), it wasn't until high- wattage bulbs and more powerful car electrical generating systems were developed in the late 1910s that electric lighting systems entirely superseded acetylene. Steering 1904 Oldsmobile Curved Dash with a tiller steering The first automobiles were steered with a tiller sometimes on the left or right, sometimes in the centre. The steering wheel was first used when Alfred Vacheron competed in the 1894 Paris–Rouen motor race in a Panhard et Levassor. In 1898, steering wheels became a standard feature of Panhard et Levassor cars. They were introduced in the U.S. by Packard in 1899, and by 1908 were on most models. Power steering helps drivers steer by augmenting the driver's steering effort. Power steering has used hydraulics to reduce a driver's steering effort. However, hydraulic steering is being replaced by electric power steering, because it eliminates the hydraulic pump, and increases fuel efficiency. Braking Standing pedals in a Saab Sonett. From left to right the standard modern layout: clutch, brake, throttle. Pedals either hang from the bulkhead or stand on the floor. The arrangement is the same for both right- and left-hand traffic. 1969 Citroen DS Pallas interior with hydraulic gear selector mounted top right of steering column with a single spoke steering wheel. Note the so-called mushroom brake pedal. (The pedal on the left is the parking brake). In modern cars the four-wheel braking system is controlled by a pedal to the left of the accelerator pedal. There is usually also a parking brake which operates the rear brakes only. On manual cars this is a lever between the front seats, but can be a pedal on some automatic transmission vehicles. In rallying the handbrake lever is long and vertical, extending to near the steering wheel, to facilitate handbrake turns. Throttle control The throttle, which controls fuel and air supply to the engine and is also known as the \\"accelerator\\" or \\"gas pedal\\", is normally the right-most floor pedal. It has a fail-safe design – a spring, which returns it to the idle position when not depressed by the driver. Normally the throttle and brake are operated by the right foot, while the clutch is operated by the left foot. However, drivers sometimes mistake the accelerator for the brake, leading to sudden unintended acceleration and causing 16,000 accidents per year in the US. However, there are drivers who practice left-foot braking. Early cars had a hand lever to control the throttle, either directly, or by controlling an engine speed governor which in turn controlled both the throttle and timing.\\"The Wilson-Pilcher Petrol Cars\\", The Automotor Journal, April 16th, 1904, pp463-468 In 1900 the Wilson-Pilcher car was introduced in Britain which had a hand controlled speed governor, and a foot throttle which could override the action of the governor. Unlike modern throttle pedals this could be raised to accelerate the car or depressed to slow it, \\"and thus quick accelerations or retardations can be effected\\" without interfering with the governed speed set using the hand control. The combination of governed engine speed with foot throttle override is in many ways similar to a modern cruise control. In spite of this development, steering column mounted hand throttles remained common, especially in mass-produced cars such as the Ford Model T. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a hand lever to set the minimum throttle. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake to the right and left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.Speed control device for resisting operation of the accelerator. Ralph R. Teetor. US-Patent 2519859 A Transmission A floor-mounted gear lever in a modern passenger car with a manual transmission Vehicles that generate power with an internal combustion engine (ICE) are generally equipped with a transmission or gearbox to change the speed-torque ratio and the direction of travel. This does not usually apply to electric vehicles because their motors can drive the vehicle both forward and backward from zero speed. In some four- wheel drive vehicles there is a gear lever that engages a low-ratio gearbox. Other levers may switch between two- and four-wheel drive and differential locks. Some cars have a freewheel that disengages the driveshaft from the driven shaft. This happens when the driven shaft rotates faster than the driveshaft. For example, Saab used a freewheel system in their earlier vehicles, to let the engine disconnect from the transmission while coasting. This was a feature added because of the limited lubrication in the two-stroke engine. A petroil-lubricated two-stroke requires lubrication according to its speed, but provides this lubrication according to the amount of its throttle opening. Where the engine operates at high RPM and low throttle (such as when coasting down a long hill), the lubrication provided may be inadequate. With the freewheel, a coasting engine could reduce its speed to idling, thus requiring only the small lubrication available from the closed, coasting, throttle. Freewheeling can also be used to help reduce high exhaust gas temperatures in two stroke models caused by prolonged use of the throttle at higher RPM. Freewheeling was retained in the four-stroke variant, until the end of production and in the Saab 99 with the 1709 cc Triumph engine. A minor drawback to the freewheel, particularly for drivers unfamiliar with the Saab, is that it makes engine braking unavailable although it could be manually engaged or disengaged by a control in the foot-well. Fixed wheel engagement, using the foot, could be difficult, as it involved pulling a 'T handle' intended for manual operation. Some cars, such as the Rover P4, include a manual switch to engage or disengage the freewheel. =Manual= Manual transmission is also known as a manual gearbox, stick shift, standard, and stick. Most automobile manual transmissions have several gear ratios that are chosen by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Manual transmissions feature a driver-operated clutch pedal and gear stick. Historically, cars had a manual overdrive switch. =Automatic= The desire for driver convenience led to the widespread implementation of the semi-automatic transmission, automatic transmission and continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some automatic transmission vehicles have extra controls that modify the choices made by the transmission system. These controls depend on the engine and road speed. Automatic transmissions generally have a straight pattern, beginning at the most forward position with park, and running through reverse, neutral, drive, and then to the lower gears. Signals and lighting Cars have controls for headlamps, fog lamps, turn signals, and other automotive lighting. Turn signals are activated by the driver to alert other drivers of their intent to turn or change lanes.Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment: Final Rule 12/04/2007 While the modern turn signal was patented in 1938, electric turn-signal lights date back to 1907. most countries require turn signals to be included on all vehicles driven on public roadways. The turn signal lever is usually activated by a horizontal lever protruding from the steering column. Instrumentation Volkswagen Polo dashboard with, left to right, controls for lighting and the horn, gauges for engine temperature, vehicle and engine speed, fuel level, and the windshield wiper control. Vehicles are generally equipped with a variety of instruments mounted on the dashboard to indicate driving parameters and the state of the mechanics. The placement of the instruments can vary. While they are usually mounted behind the steering wheel, they may also be mounted centrally below the windshield, or integrated into the center stack above the climate control and audio system. The standard gauges found on road vehicles include the following: *Speedometer *Tachometer *Odometer *Fuel gauge *Engine temperature gauge *Ammeter *Oil pressure gauge These gauges are supplemented by an assortment of warning lights that indicate the currently selected transmission gear mode, the generic check engine light, and the current status of various vehicle systems. The layout and design of these instruments have evolved over the years by being implemented as digital readouts rather than the traditional analog dial-type indicators. Depending on the type of vehicle, more specialized instruments may be used such as a trip computer, fuel economy gauge, or battery level display. Starting and running the engine 1917 Packard crank holder Before the appearance of the starter motor, engines were started by various difficult and dangerous methods. These methods included: wind-up springs, gunpowder cylinders, and human-powered techniques such as a removable hand-crank. In 1896, the first electric starter was installed on an Arnold,G.N. Georgano (1985). Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930. London: Grange-Universal. . one of the first motor cars manufactured in the United Kingdom. Charles Kettering and Henry Leland later invented and filed for the first electric starter in America in 1911. In 1912, the Cadillac Model Thirty became the first American car to have a starter installed. Before Chrysler's 1949 innovation of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, the starter was operated by the driver pressing a button that was mounted on the floor or dashboard. This type of control has now returned with the use of keyless entry. Early Chevrolet cars had the starter pedal to the right of the accelerator, with a secondary throttle control knob on the dashboard because it was difficult to operate the starter pedal and pump the gas pedal at the same time. Some other historical engine controls, which are automated in modern passenger cars, were the choke valve, ignition timing, and spark arrestor.  Additional controls  In the past, all cars had manual controls for starting and running the engine. Now, modern cars not only have automated controls, but they also have controls that are not directly used to drive the vehicle. These controls include air conditioning, navigation systems, on-board computers, in-car entertainment, windscreen wiper, and touchscreen panels. These controls vary in scope and design between different types of cars. They may also be located and operated differently in other road vehicles such as motorcycles, where the throttle is controlled by a hand lever and the gear shift is operated by a pedal. Some types of vehicle controls are found in rail vehicles. For example, some trams and light rail vehicles like the PCC streetcar use automobile-style pedals to control the speed. In Formula One auto racing, many vehicle parameters can be set by the driver during a race. Controls for these are mounted on the steering wheel, and can include controls for: brake balance, differential, ignition timing, regenerative brake, rev limiter, and others.

In 1997, the Jesuits handed over administration of the church to the Diocese of Thunder Bay who continue to serve the parish. First Nations Parishes St. Andrew's was not the first Jesuit presence in Thunder Bay. They set up the Immaculate Conception Mission (). In July 1849 by two French Jesuit missionaries, Fr Pierre Choné (1808-1879) and Fr Nicolas Frémiot (1818-1854) came to the area and started the mission. From there St. Andrew's Church was one of many churches that was missioned to the First Nations in Northern Ontario, particularly St. Patrick's Church, which in 1952 became the cathedral for the diocese and St. Agnes Church.

She served primarily as an ocean convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war, she was sold to the Dominican Republic and renamed Presidente Trujillo and in 1962, Mella. Carlplace was named for Carleton Place, Ontario, a town located in Eastern Ontario. The town's name was considered too long and was shortened. Carlplace was ordered 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 30 November 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 6 July 1944. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 13 December 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history Making her way to Halifax, Nova Scotia after her commissioning, Carlplace was seriously damaged by ice and took several weeks to repair at Halifax and eventually, Philadelphia. After repairing she proceeded to work up at Bermuda and upon her return was assigned to escort group EG 16 based out of Derry. En route to joining her group in Europe, Carplace escorted a Royal Navy submarine. She arrived in the United Kingdom in April and escorted two convoys to Gibraltar. In May she returned to Canada to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the Pacific Ocean. The refit began on 2 June 1945 at Saint John, New Brunswick, switching to Shelburne, Nova Scotia on 10 July before being called off on 20 August. Following the Surrender of Japan and the end of the war, Carlplace was paid off 13 November 1945 and laid up at Shelburne. =Dominican Navy= Carlplace was sold to the Dominican Republic in 1946 and named Presidente Trujillo for President Rafael Trujillo. She was modified for use to a presidential yacht. Modifications included extra accommodation and deck-houses were built aft. In 1962, with the fall of Rafael Trujillo, she was renamed Mella and used as a training craft. She was armed with one 76.2 mm, two 40 mm and four 20 mm guns. She was also fitted out with an American radar installation. In 1963, Mella was used to take the overthrown President Juan Bosch back into exile. In 1965, she took part in the bombardment of Santo Domingo during the Dominican Civil War. During the 1970s, Mella became known as a site for lavish parties among the naval elite. From 1970–1974, she was the only frigate in the Dominican fleet able to go to sea. Mella was deleted from the registry and turned into a museum ship in 1998.p. 69 In 2003 the Dominican Republic offered her to Carleton Place as a museum ship, however the offer was turned down due to the poor condition of the ship and the limited ability to return her to her original state as a River-class frigate. In 2010, Carleton Place was given a framed photo of the ship, a brief history and a photo of the ship's badge by the Department of National Defence in Canada as part of the Canadian Naval Centennial.

(2013). Radio Journalism in America: Telling the News in the Golden Age and Beyond. Mcfarland & Company, Inc. . P. 201. He became a staff announcer for CBS, and later became most known as the long-time announcer for Arthur Godfrey. Early life Marvin was born on October 5, 1912. A graduate of Erasmus Hall High School, he nearly became a doctor, graduating from St. John's University and attending the Long Island College of Medicine for two years. However, the Great Depression intervened, and he had to drop out to help to support his family. Marvin's obituary in the New York Times noted that \\"his big break\\" came during the latter job. It said, \\"As he serviced a limousine, the owner heard him singing and offered to pay for a vocal teacher for him The result was a scholarship for a year's study with an MGM voice coach.\\" From that training, Marvin performed with the New York Operatic Guild and in some theatrical light comedies. The Godfrey years in radio Marvin's first job in radio was at WNYC in New York City. From there, he went to CBS as a staff announcer, beginning October 1, 1939. A 1959 article in Radio and Television Mirror reported that at CBS \\"Tony did everything from daytime serials to symphonies and in 1946, when the Arthur Godfrey morning show was sustaining, Tony was assigned to it.\\" When Godfrey's activities expanded from Arthur Godfrey Time to include Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and Arthur Godfrey and his Friends, Marvin did the announcing for those shows as well.\\"Tony Marvin, Announcer Plus\\".

Godfrey at times stirred controversy with his firing of his show's personnel. Marvin was the last of Godfrey's supporting players to go. He had been with Godfrey 12 years when he learned in 1959 that Godfrey would not need an announcer for the coming year. An Associated Press story in The Miami News reported: \\"The TV and radio star said his new program will be very informal and he will handle all the commercials himself. Godfrey told Marvin he regretted their association had to end and thanked him for his services.\\" Marvin's departure was widely perceived as a more amicable parting than Godfrey's previous dismissals of cast members, which were often abrupt. Post-Godfrey years in radio Marvin branched out in 1958, adding a two-hour, Monday-Saturday disc jockey show on WABC to his other duties.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 425. Columnist Marie Torre reported in her newspaper column that the show would differ from other DJ programs \\"in its public spirit.\\" Marvin planned to honor a \\"Hero of the Week\\" and \\"visit hospitals, worthy charitable functions and various points of interest.\\" In 1961, Marvin became host of My True Story, a radio drama that moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System after having been on ABC and NBC for a total of 17 years. That same year he became a newscaster for Mutual. An ad for that network in Sponsor magazine touted Marvin's role, saying, \\"Always one of the top news commentators in the business, now he's in the Mutual line-up -- bringing his news experience into play -- as a regular member of Mutual Radio's news corps.\\" An article in Sponsor in 1962 noted the influence of Mutual's Affiliates Advisory Committee on the network's decision to hire Marvin for that role: \\"What are some of the more recent programing moves initiated by the committee? ... Insistence on stronger news voices, for one. ... Result: The hiring of Tony Marvin and Del Sharbutt to strengthen the lineup ....\\" Marvin's duties at Mutual were not limited to newscasts. The January 1962 issue of TV Radio Mirror reported, \\"He's working a full day on commercials and as a newscaster at Mutual.\\" Radio after the networks In his later years, Marvin had two more stints with programs on local radio stations. In 1976, he had a four-hour afternoon show, \\"Tony's Time,\\" on WATR in Waterbury, Connecticut. A story in the Toledo Blade reported: \\"'I'm my own engineer for the first time in years,' Marvin said. 'I'm enjoying it.' He cues records, pushes the buttons for the taped commercials, and decides what kind of music to play, including show tunes, vocals, big bands, and lighter contemporary sounds.\\" Beginning in 1977, Marvin had a show on WDJZ in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which at the time was one of the first radio stations playing the \\"Music of Your Life\\" format, consisting primarily of music from the big band era. In 1981, Marvin came out of retirement to do \\"The Tony Marvin Show,\\" a one-hour program broadcast live from the Palm Beach Hilton on WKAO. He said, \\"I want to bring back live radio.\\" The show originated in the hotel's dining room and featured an orchestra. An anecdote in a newspaper article summarized the program and Marvin's reason for doing it.: > [V]ocalist Kit Stewart stepped to the microphone and announced she would > sing \\"That Old Feeling.\\" \\"Oh, you've got that old feeling,\\" Marvin mused. \\"I > sure do.\\" \\"Well, it looks good on you.\\" A couple with their young child > listened from cushioned arm chairs in a corner by the windows while Ms. > Stewart sang in her sensuous voice. \\"It brought back that old feeling to > me,\\" said Marvin when she finished, \\"because that's the way it used to be in > radio.\\" Indeed it was. The same kind of songs and unrehearsed chatter done > on the show were the format of Arthur Godfrey's radio shows in the latter > 1940s. Other professional activities Marvin's obituary in The New York Times noted that he \\"was made the official 'voice' of the New York World's Fair\\" of 1939. On television, in addition to his work with the Godfrey programs, Marvin was the \\"Voice of Authority\\" on the CBS program, We Take Your Word. In 1957, Marvin recorded an LP album, \\"Words and Music of Love,\\" featuring his recitation of poems backed by Lee Erwin's organ music. A review in The Billboard summarized the recording thus: \\"Tony Marvin ... reads a group of love poems (mostly by contemporary American poets) with a surprising amount of reticence and tenderness.\\" Family Martin married Dorothea Wiener June 6, 1937.

The hospital was completed in November 1931 and cost $1.6 million to construct. Built on a hill near the center of the city, the 12-storey building, topped with a gleaming metal dome, was a prominent landmark in Saint John's skyline. The hospital boasted state-of-the-art facilities for its time: in 1932 its new cancer clinic was treating patients with radiation therapy, in 1952 it introduced a neurosurgery department, and in the 1960s it became the first hospital in the region to offer renal dialysis. The building was expanded in 1959 with the addition of a new wing, but by the late 1970s the facility was dated and many services formally provided at the General Hospital had moved to newer hospitals. On October 31, 1982, the last patients were moved to other facilities and the hospital officially closed. It remained empty and condemned until December 10, 1995, when the building was demolished by a controlled implosion. The hospital's dome survived the demolition intact and was pulled from the rubble. It now forms the roof of a gazebo in a small Saint John park, located near Garden Street.

Compiling diverse evidence such as limited accumulation of soil organic matter, high phenol oxidative and proteolytic enzyme potentials due to microbial activity, and symbioses between plants and fungi, the fungal loop hypothesis suggests that carbon and nutrients are cycled in biotic pools rather than leached or effluxed to the atmosphere during and between pulses of precipitation.Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420. Theory development The fungal loop hypothesis is similar in concept to the microbial loop hypotheses in oceans or soil, more specifically for arid ecosystems. That is because of characteristics specific to arid ecosystems that are not found elsewhere. =Pulse dynamics= In arid ecosystems, there is low total precipitation and high variability in size of rain events (pulses) within and between years. Differences in how plants and decomposers respond to these pulses of precipitation affects biogeochemical cycling within the ecosystem. For example, extracellular enzymes present in the soil become active nearly instantaneously after any moisture pulse, while production in microbes and plants have lag times of various durations, and require pulse events of different sizes. Williams, C.A., Hanan, N., Scholes, R.J., Kutsch, W. 2009. Complexity in water and carbon dioxide fluxes following rain pulses in an African savanna. Oecologia 161: 469-480. =Patchy distribution of nutrient pools= Arid ecosystems also often have patchy distributions of vascular plants with bare patches of soil in between. Such vegetation reduces radiation and wind speed at the soil surface which reduces evaporation and thus creates favorable microhabitats for other species. In addition, as plants senesce and become litter, this increases carbon and nitrogen contents in the top layers of soil under plant canopies.Charley, J.L., and West, N.E. 1975. Plant-Induced Soil Chemical Patterns in Some Shrub- Dominated Semi-Desert Ecosystems of Utah. Journal of Ecology 63(3): 945-963. Together, these effects create “islands of fertility” where plants are distributed.Schlesinger, W.H., and Pilmanis, A.M. 1998. Plant-soil interactions in deserts. Biogeochemistry 42: 169-187. In the bare soil between plants, biological soil crusts are often present. Crust microorganisms can fix carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere as well as trap nitrogen-rich dust.Hawkes, C. 2003. Nitrogen cycling mediated by biological soil crusts and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Ecology 84: 1553-1562. Therefore, biology soil crusts contribute to carbon content and nutrient resources in soil surfaces where plant cover is low. =The role of fungi in biogeochemical cycling= Litter produced by plants must be broken down by decomposers into nutrients available to organisms. Both bacteria and fungi produce extracellular enzymes to break down large molecules into compounds that can be taken up by plants.Skujins, R.G. 1976. Extracellular enzymes in soil. CRC Critical Reviews in Microbiology. 4(4): 383-421. However, fungi can metabolize at higher temperatures and lower water potentials than bacteria. Therefore, in arid ecosystems where precipitation falls during the hot season, fungi are likely the most important contributors to nutrient cycling due to their tolerance to temperature and ability to persist during long dry periods. In several sites in the southwestern US, denitrification and nitrification were shown to be mostly carried out by fungi.Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420. =The fungal loop= In arid ecosystems, many primary producers, such as grasses and biological soil crusts, form symbioses with fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi colonizing plant roots acquire carbon directly from plant roots, provide phosphorus sources to plants, and have been shown to transport water.Allen, M.F. 2007. Mycorrhizal Fungi: Highways for Water and Nutrients in Arid Soils. Vadose Zone Journal 6(2): 291-297. Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are also common in many aridland plants and are hypothesized to perform similar roles as mycorrhizal fungi.Mandyam, K. and Jumpponen, A. 2005. Seeking the elusive function of the root-colonising dark septate endophytic fungi. Studies in Mycology. 53: 173-189. Fungi are an integral part of the biological soil crust community, and similar fungal taxa have been found in biological soil crusts and plant root zones, which suggests hyphal connections between these two spatially separate organisms.Porras-Alfaro, A., Herrera, J., Natvig, D.O., Lipinski, K., Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2011. Diversity and distribution of soil fungal communities in a semiarid grassland. Mycologia 103: 10-21. The fungal loop hypothesis suggests that biological soil crusts and associated microbes are able to become active after smaller water pulses compared to vascular plants, which require more water to become active. However, fungi are able to take up the nutrients produced by biological soil crusts at lower water potentials, and keep them in the biotic pool until larger water pulses allow plants to become active and take up those nutrients. Active plants then are able to contribute excess carbon from photosynthesis to their fungal symbionts. Therefore, root-associated fungi symbiotic with plants and biological soil crusts connect the spatially- and temporally-distinct activities of crusts and plants. Evidence Evidence of conditions favorable to the existence of a fungal loop is readily available.Collins, S.L., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Crenshaw, C., Green, L., Porras-Alfaro, A., Stursova, M., and Zeglin, L.H. 2008. Pulse dynamics and microbial processes in aridland ecosystems. Journal of Ecology 96: 413–420. However, direct experimental tests of the hypothesis in arid ecosystems are still relatively rare. One study used isotopic labeling to trace where nitrate and glutamate moved when provided to biological soil crust or to grass foliage a distance away. They found that organic and inorganic N could be dispersed up to 100 cm per day bidirectionally between plants and crust.Green, L.E., Porras-Alfaro, A., and Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2008. Translocation of nitrogen and carbon integrates biotic crust and grass production in desert grassland. Journal of Ecology 96: 1076–1085. Other research has shown evidence of bidirectional transport in soil-fungal-plant connections in redistributing water in arid ecosystems.Allen, M. F. (2009), Bidirectional water flows through the soil–fungal–plant mycorrhizal continuum. New Phytologist, 182: 290–293.

Hall departed to become a professional wrestler.Hall Family - Kobayo  Professional wrestling career  =Early career (2012–2014)= Hall began to train as a professional wrestler in 2010 with his father, as he wanted to follow in his footsteps. Hall's first match took place on July 14, 2012 in Belleview Pro Wrestling, defeating Josh Hess.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=82421 In the following years, Hall worked in various promotions, usually in tag matches with Kevin Nash or Sean Waltman, both Scott Hall's friends. On November 15, 2014, at Superstars of Wrestling 2, Hall won the Superstars of Wrestling Championship after defeating Tim Zbyszko in a ladder match.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=120386 In 2014, Hall won the Georgia Heavyweight Championship from Southern Fried Championship Wrestling. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (2015–2017)= Hall as a member of Bullet Club in February 2015 Hall working in NJPW in 2015 In January 2015, Hall began training at the New Japan Pro Wrestling dojo. On January 5 at New Year Dash!!, Hall debuted as Bullet Club's personal \\"young boy\\" trainee. Hall made his NJPW in-ring debut on February 2, teaming with his stablemates Doc Gallows, Karl Anderson, Kenny Omega and Yujiro Takahashi in a ten-man tag team main event, where they were defeated by Captain New Japan, Hirooki Goto, Katsuyori Shibata, Ryusuke Taguchi and Hiroshi Tanahashi, who pinned him for the win. As is usually the case with \\"young boys\\" in Japan, Hall would lose many of his first matches with NJPW, and often be pinned in multi-man tag matches, but achieved his first victory on April 29 at Wrestling Hinokuni in a tag team match, where he and Yujiro Takahashi defeated Captain New Japan and Satoshi Kojima. Hall, however, was not involved in the finish of the match. Over the next year, Hall mainly worked tag team matches with his Bullet Club stablemates, while also becoming an enforcer for The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Hall scored his first win himself on April 2, 2016, when he submitted rookie Hirai Kawato in a singles match. Hall was injured later that month at Invasion Attack 2016, and remained sidelined until January 2017, when his profile was quietly removed from NJPW's roster page, signaling his departure from the promotion. = Pro Wrestling Noah (2017–2019) = On March 13, 2017, the Japanese Pro Wrestling Noah promotion announced that Hall would start working regularly for the promotion on April 11. The following month, Hall teamed with Randy Reign in the 2017 Global Tag League, finishing with a record of four wins and three losses, failing to advance to the finals. During the tournament, Hall and Reign defeated eventual tournament winners and reigning GHC Tag Team Champions Maybach Taniguchi and Naomichi Marufuji, making them the number one contenders to Taniguchi and Marufuji.

From 1977 to 1985 he worked at the BMW Motorsport and one of his first programme was the touring car BMW Junior Team which promoted Eddie Cheever, Manfred Winkelhock and Marc Surer through the ranks. In 1980 Stappert took the role of Sporting Director and became responsible for BMW F1 programme, resulting in Nelson Piquet winning the 1983 F1 World Championship with the BMW-powered Brabham. In 1986 Stappert became the motorsport manager for HB tobacco brand, acting also as team manager of the 250cc world championship motorcycle racing team. He created a highly competitive team signing former Anton Mang's mechanic Franz- Josef \\"Sepp\\" Schlögl as technical director and starting a long-term relationship with Honda Racing Corporation to receive factory-spec NSR250s. Over the years the HB team won many races with riders like Reinhold Roth, Helmut Bradl and Ralf Waldmann but never achieved the world title, finishing as runner-up four times (1987, 1989, 1991 and 1996). After the withdrawal of HB from motorcycle road racing, Stappert established his own racing team in 1997 with Marlboro sponsorship and a factory Honda NSR250 for Ralf Waldmann who finished again second in championship. In 1998 the team received Castrol sponsorship and entered a NSR250 for Stefano Perugini with poor results. Since 1999 to 2005 the team raced with Aprilia motorcycles and was known as Aprilia Germany. During this period the most notable riders were Ralf Waldmann, Jeremy McWilliams and Chaz Davies. In 2006 Stappert managed the KTM Junior Team in the 125cc class with Stefan Bradl as rider.

It is approximately long and is the largest tributary of Catawissa Creek. Named tributaries of the creek include Little Crooked Run, Little Tomhicken Creek, Raccoon Creek, and Sugarloaf Creek. The watershed of the main stem has an area of 20.6 square miles. A number of mine tunnels discharge into the creek and its tributaries. Course The headwaters of Tomhicken Creek are inside a deep mine. Tomhicken Creek begins in southwestern Hazle Township, Luzerne County immediately west of an area of strip mines and north of Pismire Ridge. It flows west-southwest, roughly paralleling Pennsylvania Route 924 and shortly leaves Hazle Township and Luzerne County. Upon leaving Luzerne County, the creek enters East Union Township, in Schuylkill County. It crosses Pennsylvania Route 924 and flows immediately north of another area of strip mines before turning northwest to flow off Green Mountain and entering North Union Township. It receives Sugarloaf Creek in the eastern reaches of the township and shortly afterwards passes the community of Miller's Corner. At Miller's Corner, Tomhicken Creek turns southwest and then north, receiving Raccoon Creek. The creek then turns southwest again and meanders several times south of Red Ridge before reaching its confluence with Catawissa Creek near the community of Zion Grove. =Tributaries= Tomhicken Creek's tributaries include Sugarloaf Creek, Little Tomhicken Creek, and Raccoon Creek. Raccoon Creek is approximately long and flows west from Black Creek Township, Luzerne County into North Union Township, Schuylkill County, where it joins Tommhicken Creek. Little Tomhicken Creek is approximately long and flows southwest to join Tomhicken Creek in East Union Township. Sugarloaf Creek is approximately long and flows from Hazle Township, Luzerne County to North Union Township, where it joins the main stem. Other tributaries include Little Crooked Run and \\"Trib 27568 to Tomhicken Creek\\". Hydrology Little Tomhicken Creek contributes acid mine drainage to Tomhicken Creek. There are also high concentrations of nutrients in the creek. Upstream of Little Tomhicken Creek, Sugarloaf Creek, and the Oneida No. 3 Tunnel, the iron concentration is 0.5 milligrams per liter. The daily load is . The manganese concentration is 0.08 milligrams per liter, equating to a daily load of . The concentration of aluminum is 0.69 milligrams per liter, so the daily load is . The concentrations of acidity and alkalinity are 0.83 and 23.37 milligrams per liter respectively and the loads are per day and per day. The concentration of sulfates ranges from 10 to 65 milligrams per liter with an average of 25.69 milligrams per liter. At the mouth of Tomhicken Creek, the concentration of iron is 0.15 milligrams per liter. The daily load is . The manganese concentration is 0.17 milligrams per liter, equating to a daily load of . The concentration of aluminum is 0.42 milligrams per liter, so the daily load is .

The pH of Tomhicken Creek upstream of Little Tomhicken Creek, Sugarloaf Creek, and the Oneida No. 3 Tunnel ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 with an average of 6.52. At the mouth, the pH ranges from 5.8 to 6.2 with an average of 6.0. Before 1997, much of the lower reaches of the creek had a pH from 4.0 to 4.9. The discharge of Tomhicken Creek near its headwaters is 10,681 gallons per minute. Near Zion Grove, the discharge is 10,687.5 gallons per minute. Geology The Oneida No. 3 Tunnel empties into Tomhicken Creek downstream of the mouth of Little Tomhicken Creek. The Oneida No. 1 Tunnel discharges into the tributary Sugarloaf Creek. Little Sugarloaf Mountain is located between Tomhicken Creek and Little Tomhicken Creek. There is a small and narrow basin of coal in the watershed of Tomhicken Creek. The Mauch Chunk Formation is found near the confluence of the creek with Catawissa Creek and much of the rest of the Tomhicken Creek watershed. However, some of the upper reaches of the watershed are occupied by the Hamilton Group. The soils in the watershed include the Leck Kill soil in the lower reaches and the Hazleton Soil in the upper reaches. There are deep valleys north and south of the Tomhicken Creek basin due to erosion. Watershed The watershed of Tomhicken Creek has an area of 20.6 square miles. The creek is the largest tributary of Catawissa Creek. The watershed is not far from the headwaters of Black Creek at Little Sugarloaf Mountain. The Tomhicken Creek watershed does not border any other major sub- watersheds of Catawissa Creek. The Eagle Rock Resort is located in the upper reaches of the Tomhicken Creek. It consists mostly of second homes or retirement homes. History and recreation Gristmills and other types of mills were built on the creek some time before 1901. The Red Ridge Road bridge over Tomhicken Creek was built in 1937. A nine-ton weight restriction was placed on it in 2010. A number of large private campgrounds have been established along the creek. Biology Tomhicken Creek is a coldwater fishery. Little Tomhicken Creek was studied by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in 1997 and found to be completely devoid of fish. This has later been found to inaccurate. Tomhicken Creek was found to be teeming with life such as the Bluntnose minnow, Brook trout, Brown Trout, digger crayfish and multiple species of turtles. The tributary Raccoon Creek is classified as a high-quality coldwater fishery. There are four species of fish in the upper reaches of Tomhicken Creek and five species of fish between two sites in the lower reaches. A large population of brook trout, as well as several other fish species, inhabit the tributary Raccoon Creek. There is also a significant population of brook trout in the tributary Little Crooked Run. In 1905, 700 rainbow trout were observed in Tomhicken Creek and Little Tomhicken Creek. Significant numbers of Allocapnia and Taeniopteryx were observed on Tomhicken Creek near Zion Grove in 2003. Sweltsa have also been observed in the creek.

A Shardmap index consists of a scalable number of index shards. Each shard entry maps a hash key to the logical block number of a directory entry block known to contain a name that hashes to that key. Each shard is represented as an unsorted fifo on disk and a small hash table in memory. Shardmap scales in two ways: # Rehash a cached shard to a larger number of hash buckets # Reshard a stored shard fifo to divide it into multiple, smaller shards. These operations are staggered to avoid latency spikes. The reshard operation imposes a modest degree of write multiplication on the Shardmap design, asymptotically approaching a factor of two. The key ideas of Shardmap are: # The representation of directory data is not the same on media as it is in cache. On media we have fifos, but in cache we have hash tables. # Updating a fifo is cache efficient. Only the tail block of the fifo needs to be present in cache. The cache footprint of the media image of a shardmap is therefore just one disk block per shard. # A small fifo on media is easily loaded and converted to an efficient hash table shard on demand. Once in cache, index updates are performed by updating the cached hash table and appending the same entries to the final block of the shard fifo. The shardmap implementation in the Tux3 file system uses SipHash hash function designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein.

It was the home ground of Clapton Orient between 1930 and 1937. History The stadium was originally a speedway venue, but also started hosting football matches in 1930 when Clapton Orient moved to the site, having been forced to leave their Millfields Road ground due to financial problems.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p83, At the time that Orient moved to the ground, spectator facilities included a covered stand on the southern side of the ground and embankments around the remainder. The first League match played at the ground was a 3–1 win against Newport County on 3 September 1930 with 5,505 in attendance.Smith & Smith, p75 A few weeks into the season, the Football League authorities notified the club that the gap between the edge of the pitch and the speedway track fence was too narrow, and that no more matches could be played at the ground until this was rectified. Whilst the works were carried out, Orient played two matches at Wembley Stadium; a 3–0 win over Brentford on 22 November (with an attendance of 10,300) and a 3–1 win against Southend United on 6 December (2,500).Smith & Smith, p142 Further improvements were later made to the ground, including a covered stand on the northern touchline and concrete terracing on the west, north and eastern sides of the stadium. The works increased the capacity to around 20,000, and Orient's record League crowd of 20,400 was set on 13 March 1937 when Millwall were beaten 1–0.

At least 16 job seekers were confirmed dead, and several scores of people were injured. The major causes of death was due to overcrowding, stampede, exhaustion, and impatience of the applicants.  Background  According to the National Bureau of Statistics, at least 23.9% of Nigerians are currently unemployed (about 40 million). All applicants for the exercise paid 1000 Naira (about $6) before they could complete their registration for the test. They were also mandated to provide a medical report before being considered eligible for the exercise. Since the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) is a Paramilitary agency, they were instructed to put on white sporting attires for fitness training and easy identification. The Minister of the Interior, Abba Moro, and the NIS delegated the exercise to a consultancy firm citing transparency and accountability as reasons for this step. Locations with injuries or fatalities The following does not include numerous episodes of fainting, most of which were heat- related, and all of which were treated successfully on the scene. At one location, Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri, ten people fainted while waiting to enter the venue, including three pregnant women. =Abuja National Stadium, Abuja (10 fatalities, 50 injured)= An estimated 100,000 job hopefuls arrived for testing in Abuja. 64,000 applicants had been invited to the 60,000 capacity Abuja National Stadium. When the gate opened, the crowd surged, killing seven people and injuring more than 50 others. Three of the injured died later at the National Hospital, which had become overwhelmed and sent several of its admitted patients to other hospitals. The event carried on. =Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin (4 fatalities, 50 injured)= At the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, applicants began gathering as early as 6:00 AM, and NIS officials lost control of the crowd of 28,000 by 10:00 AM. Soldiers began firing their rifles in the air, causing a panic in which four applicants were killed and 50 injured. Thirty of the injured received treatment at local hospitals and clinics. One witness described the four who died as three pregnant women and a nursing mother. Applicant screening began at 2:15 PM, but the event was soon called off. =Women Day Secondary School, Minna (3 fatalities, 4 critically injured)= Three applicants were killed and four were left in critical condition following the NIS recruitment event in Minna. The venue at the Women Day Secondary School had a capacity of 11,000. It was filled to capacity as early as 7:00 AM. A line formed outside the venue hat was two kilometers long. When NIS officials sensed they were losing control over the crowd, they used tear gas, which caused a panic, leading to the trampling deaths of three applicants and critical injuries to four others. =Port Harcourt Stadium, Port Harcourt (5 fatalities, more than 8 injured)= The NIS invited 25,000 candidates to the 16,000 capacity Port Harcourt Stadium, though the NIS spokesman for the Port Harcourt Command, Bisong Abang, estimated the crowd to be 40,000. At 10:00 AM, NIS officials opened one of the two gates to begin screening applicants. The crowd surged forward, and many of those in front fell to the ground, with those behind them falling on top of them in a progressive crowd collapse. Soldiers fired their rifles into the air, as they did in Benin, though this caused further panic in the crowd. One unnamed witness said “far fewer people would have died today if the officers had not shot into the air.\\" When it was over, two people were dead at the scene, and three died later in a local hospital. One physician, speaking anonymously, at Braithwaithe Memorial Specialist Hospital said 12 patients had been brought to that facility. Of those 12, four had died, four were in critical condition, and four had been treated and released. Other patients were treated in the nearby military hospital. Although the shooting caused a panic, at least one witness credits the soldiers' actions with saving his life, as he and others at the front of the line were being crushed by those behind him, some losing consciousness, and the rifle shots dispersed the crowd. =Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano (0 fatalities, 7 injured)= Seven people were injured when a surge led to a crush at the only open entrance to the Sani Abacha stadium. No fatalities were reported in Kano. =Lagos (possibly one fatality or more, unknown injuries)= Moro told reporters that the deputy controller of immigration operation and passport told him that he had called off the recruitment event in Lagos because of \\"the unruly behaviour of the applicants\\". Moro also listed the Lagos venue among the locations where fatalities occurred, though he was not quoted as giving a number. An estimated 64,000 applicants had come to that recruiting site.  Reactions  On March 16, 2014, the Minister for Interior Patrick Abba Moro explained in an interview that the applicant's impatience and failure to follow instructions were the cause of the tragedy. The Coalition Against Corrupt Leaders (CACOL) called for Moro's prosecution. Moro appeared before a Senate Committee on interior for two days of public hearings. On March 27, he accepted responsibility for the events and expressed his grief. He said he was saddened that his effort to put an end to nepotism and favoritism in the recruitment process had turned out like this. President Goodluck Jonathan ordered automatic employment for affected families. He also ordered immediate return of all the funds collected from the applicants. He went further to say that there would be a new recruitment exercise and the previous one would be cancelled.

As of August 2018, Flax family owned and operated specialty retail stores are located in San Francisco, Oakland, Atlanta, Orlando, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The Flax businesses were founded between 1919 and 1946 by four Flax brothers, with locations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. The business entities have always been independent of each other, yet through common branding they have represented a coast-to-coast Flax Art Supply presence.  Beginnings  In 1903, Meyer Flax arrived in New York on the SS Pennsylvania from a small farming community in Russia.Staatsarchiv Hamburg. Hamburg Passenger Lists, 1850-1934 database on- line. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2008. The eldest in a family of six children with four boys and two girls, Meyer earned enough over the next two years to send tickets back home for his siblings and parents so they could join him in America. The family settled in Bayonne, New Jersey. Meyer sent his two younger brothers, Louis and Sam, to school, while Herman, the second oldest and still a young teenager, joined Meyer’s growing painting and contracting business. In 1911, Louis was invited into the business before he and Herman spent time in World War I, after which the three brothers, Meyer, Herman and Louis, enjoyed much success until the 1930s. Sam had secured his livelihood with an art supply business. When his three brothers lost their contracting business and all real estate holdings in the Great Depression, Sam invited them into his business to learn the art supply trade. Not wanting to compete with kin, eventually Meyer, Herman, and Louis each moved with their family to a different American city, spreading the Flax art supply stores across the country.1964, February, \\"Industry Mourns Sam Flax, Outstanding Pioneer, Leader\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XVI, number 2, pp. 8–9.1972, November, \\"What Makes Lenny Run?\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XXIV, number 11, pp. 22–23, 46–47.1974, September, \\"Sam Flax Goes To Atlanta\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XXVI, number 9, pp. 28–29.  Chronology  = New York, est. 1919 = Sam Flax was sixteen years old when he answered a newspaper ad for his first and only employer, art supply dealer Sam Halpern. Ten years later in 1919, Sam Flax opened his own store in New York City, aptly named Sam Flax. All three of Sam's sons, Leonard, Sidney, and David, entered the business after World War II. Sidney opened a second store in Brooklyn in 1949, and was the first to implement the Flax style of creative merchandising when he introduced colorful neckties. Over the next three decades, the brothers grew the business to five Sam Flax stores in New York. Sam Flax died in 1963. In 1973, David Flax established a new Sam Flax store in Atlanta, then in 1990 he opened another store in Orlando, Florida. In 2003, the two (see the 1980s) New York Sam Flax stores were sold to individuals outside the Flax family. A 95-year presence in New York came to an end in 2014, when the Midtown store closed its doors for good on Christmas Eve.http://commercialobserver.com/2014/12/sam-flax-flagship-closing- after-95-years-of-selling-art-supplies/, by Lauren Elkies Schram, Commercial Observer, December 2, 2014 Members of the Flax family originally from New York continue to run the Orlando and Atlanta stores, which both moved into larger locations in 2011.http://www.whatnowatlanta.com/2011/06/09/sam-flax-art- supply-to-relocate-after-20-years/, \\"Sam Flax art supply to relocate after 20 years\\", by Caleb J.

Like their father, Don and Al learned the business by working under Sam Flax in New York. By 1970 the company grew to have two businesses: a primary 14,000 sq ft store in the Chicago Loop and a smaller retail store led by Al, and Regents Products Co., a wholesaling business run by Don. Louis presided over both as president. The retail business began concentrating on the framing category in the 1980s, and Al's son Brian continues to run the company under the name Flax Art & Frame. In 1979, Al and Don purchased Meyer's Art Supply in Phoenix. Don moved there, and was soon after joined by Al's son Doug, who took over management of the 15,000 sg. ft. Phoenix Flax store upon Don's retirement in 1990. Following Al's death in 2003 the store closed the following year, primarily hastened by a poor economy.http://legacy.suntimes.com/obituaries/chicagosuntimes/obituary.aspx?n=donald- flax&pid;=137149718, Chicago Sun-Times, \\"Donald Flax, obituary\\", Dec. 11, 2009http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-11/news/0311110221_1_commercial- artist-art-supply-store-brother, Chicago Tribune, \\"Alvin Flax, 77\\", Nov. 11, 2003 Like their Uncle Sam, both Al and Don served as Directors for the art supply industry organization NAMTA, with Don serving as its president from 1961–1963.1975, May, \\"NAMTA Celebrates 25 Years of Service to Art Materials Industry\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XXVII, number 5, p. 35.1975, March, \\"The Flax Story-Chicago Style\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XXVII, number 3, pp. 24, 25, 45.Jack Roland Coggins, 1982, October, \\"Don Flax Takes on Phoenix\\", Art Material Trade News, volume XXXIV, number 10, p. 15.  The 1980s  The advent of desktop publishing and CAD in the 1980s brought a dramatic change to the art supply industry. Prior to that period, an art supply retail business could expect up to 65% of sales from commercial sources, which included business from advertising, engineering and architectural firms. Layouts and designs were created manually using materials such as drafting supplies and rub-on lettering (see Letraset). When those processes shifted onto computers, a traditional source of revenue quickly dried up and art supply businesses had to adapt. For the Flax stores, New York closed all but one art supply branch in that city(and Kate's Paperie opened, which tapped into a growing demand for unique paper products); San Francisco diversified into mail order with new product categories; and Chicago shifted their emphasis to picture frames and framing services.  Collaborative branding  The Flax logo designed by Louis Danziger Harvey Flax, who in 1949 was just entering the Los Angeles Flax business to work with his father Meyer, commissioned a young designer named Louis Danziger to create a new trademark. The logo was originally intended to support a private label program for a new formula of pressure sensitive rubber cement, but soon thereafter the 'F' was adopted and shared with the other Flax businesses across the country as a unifying branding element. Danziger is one of the most respected graphic designers in America, distinguished by the AIGA award in 1998 for \\"standards of excellence over a lifetime of work\\".http://www.aiga.org/medalists/, \\"AIGA\\", accessed March 16, 2014. He has done work for Microsoft, General Lighting, and A & M Records among others, and went on to teach at his alma mater, Art Center College of Design.http://thinkingform.com/#/2012/11/17/thinking-louis- danziger-11-17-1923, Aswin Sadha, \\"Thinking Louis Danziger. 11 17 1923\\", Thinking Form, November 17, 2012 In his approach to design, Danziger’s goal was in “taking a minimal amount of material and a minimal amount of effort- nothing wasted-to achieve maximum impact.” Featured in the book American Modernism: graphic design 1920–1960, the authors state “The ‘F’ is simply constructed, bold in weight and adaptable to many applications.”R.

From the early 1960s–1980, the Flax entities shared in the production and distribution of a commercial catalog that utilized Danziger's 'F'. The art supply catalog averaged 150 pages and featured thousands of items.1974, December, “The World of Advertising”, Art Material Trade News, volume XXVI, number 12, p. 23.1967, November, “Selling Successfully by Catalog”, Art Material Trade News, volume XIX, number 11, p. 9. More than 60 years later, the different Flax locations still use the original logo, though with some variations.  Products  The Flax stores remain independently operated. Each has its own unique product assortment.

Incident During the late 1980s in Hong Kong, actress Carina Lau was abducted by triad members for refusing a film offer from a triad boss, which was a very known case for many years. In 2008, renowned film producer and former chairman of the Hong Kong Film Award Manfred Wong revealed on his blog that Lau was abducted and forced to fly to the Netherlands to act in China White, alongside co-stars Andy Lau and Alex Man, whom were also forced as well. For many years, rumors surrounding that Andy Lau, one of the top box office draws in Hong Kong, was once forced at gunpoint by triads to shoot a film. Wong also confirmed on his blog that China White was the film that Lau was forced at gunpoint to act in. Many people believe that producer Jim Choi, who would benefit the most from it, was the mastermind of the case. Choi, who was the manager of Jet Li and Nina Li, was shot dead in 1992 at the age of 38. After Choi's death, there were many rumors surrounding around it including his connection to the Netherlands triads, keeping Li away from other film producers and karma for his actions in filming China White.

The Austro-Hungarian Army entered the country in two large movements: one from the north into Bosnia, and another from the south into Herzegovina. A series of battles in August culminated in the fall of Sarajevo on the 19th after a day of street-to-street fighting. In the hilly countryside a guerrilla campaign continued until the last rebel stronghold fell after their leader was captured.  Background  Bosnia, Herzegovina and Novi Pazar on a map from 1904 Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the Congress of Berlin was organized by the Great Powers. By article 25 of the resulting Treaty of Berlin (13 July 1878), Bosnia and Herzegovina remained under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, but the Austro-Hungarian Empire was granted the authority to occupy the vilayet (province) of Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely, taking on its military defence and civil administration. The Austro-Hungarians also received the right to indefinitely occupy strategic posts in the sanjak of Novi Pazar: > The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be occupied and administered > by Austria-Hungary. The government of Austria-Hungary, not desiring to > undertake the administration of the Sanjak of Novi-Pazar, which extends > between Serbia and Montenegro in a South-Easterly direction to the other > side of Mitrovitza, the Ottoman administration will continue to exercise its > functions there. Nevertheless, in order to assure the maintenance of the new > political state of affairs, as well as freedom and security of > communications, Austria-Hungary reserves the right of keeping garrisons and > having military and commercial roads in the whole of this part of the > ancient vilayet of Bosnia. To this end the governments of Austria-Hungary > and Turkey reserve to themselves to come to an understanding on the > details.Modern History Sourcebook: The Treaty of Berlin, 1878—Excerpts on > the Balkans hosted by Fordham University Although the Ottomans protested the occupation of Novi Pazar, the Imperial and Royal (K.u.K.) Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy secretly assured the former that the occupation in Novi Pazar was \\"to be regarded as provisional\\". This Austro-Hungarian expansion southward at the expense of the Ottoman Empire was designed to prevent the extension of Russian influence and the union of Serbia and Montenegro. The Austro-Hungarians expected no trouble in carrying out their occupation. It would be, in Andrássy's words, \\"a walk with a brass band\\" (Spaziergang mit einer Blasmusikkapelle). This opinion did not take into account that the Serbs had just fought a war for independence from the Ottoman Empire, while Herzegovina had revolted. Resistance to the Austro-Hungarian takeover came mainly from the Orthodox Serbs (43% of the population) and the Bosnian Muslims (39%), barely at all from the Catholic Croats (18%). The Muslim population stood to lose the most under the new Christian government. The resistors were characterised by the Austro-Hungarian government as \\"uncivilised\\" (unzivilisiert) and \\"treacherous\\" (verräterisch). Troops Infantry Regiment No. 17 crossing the Sava by Karl Pippich (1905) The Austro- Hungarian Army engaged in a major mobilization effort to prepare for the assault on Bosnia and Herzegovina, commanding by the end of June 1878 a force of 82,113 troops, 13,313 horses and 112 cannons in the VI, VII, XX, and XVIII infantry divisions as well as a rear army in the Kingdom of Dalmatia. The primary commander was Josip Filipović; the forward XVIII infantry division was under the command Stjepan Jovanović, while the rear army commander in Dalmatia was Gavrilo Rodić. The occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina started on 29 July 1878 and was over on 20 October. The Ottoman army in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time consisted of roughly 40,000 troops with 77 cannons, that combined with local militias to around 93,000 men. Fierce resistance from Muslims was expected as Austro-Hungarians realized their occupation meant that Bosnian Muslims would lose their privileged status based on their religion.  Occupation  Battle of Jajce, painting by Karl Pippich The original occupying force, the 13th Corps under General Josip Filipović, crossed the river Sava near Brod, Kostajnica and Gradiška. The various Abteilungen assembled at Banja Luka and advanced down the road on the left side of the Vrbas river. They encountered resistance by local Muslims under the dervish Hadži Loja, supported (almost openly) by the evacuating Ottoman Army troops. On 3 August a troop of hussars was ambushed near Maglaj on the Bosna river, prompting Filipović to institute martial law. On 7 August a pitched battle was fought near Jajce and the Austro-Hungarian infantry lost 600 men. A second occupying force, the 18th Division of 9,000 men under General Stjepan Jovanović, advanced out of Austrian Dalmatia along the Neretva. On 5 August the division captured Mostar, the chief city of Herzegovina. On 13 August at Ravnice in Herzegovina more than 70 Hungarian officers and soldiers were killed in action. In response, the Empire mobilised the 3rd, 4th and 5th Corps. Assault on Livno (15 August 1878) by Julius von Blaas. The Austro-Hungarian troops were occasionally met with ferocious opposition from elements of both Muslim and Orthodox populations there, and significant battles occurred near Čitluk, Stolac, Livno and Klobuk. Despite setbacks at Maglaj and Tuzla, Sarajevo was occupied in October 1878. \\"Storming of the Castle of Sarajevo\\", from The Graphic (1878) Battle for Sarajevo, by G. Durand, from The Graphic (1878) On 19 August the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, a town of 50,000 inhabitants at the time, was captured only after the deployment of 52 guns and violent street fighting. A day earlier Filipović had arrested the former Ottoman governor, Hafiz Pasha. A formal report of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff remarked \\"small windows and numerous roof gaps allowed the discharge of fire in different directions and the most sustainable defense\\" and \\"the accused insurgents, in the nearest houses, barricaded all entrances and kept up a destructive fire against the infantry.\\" According to Filipović's own account: > \\"There ensued one of the most terrible battles conceivable. The troops were > fired upon from every house, from every window, from each split door; and > even women took part. Located at the western entrance to the city, the > military hospital was full of sick and wounded insurgents. . .\\" The occupiers lost 57 killed and 314 wounded of the 13,000 soldiers employed in the operation. They estimated the insurgent fatalities at 300, but made no effort to estimate civilian casualties. In the days following there were many executions of accused rebels following summary trials. After the fall of Sarajevo the main insurgents retreated into the mountainous country beyond the city and there maintained their resistance for several weeks. Hadži Loja surrendered to the K.u.K. Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 37 Erzherzog Joseph on 3 October in the ravine by Rakitnica. He was sentenced to death, but his sentence was later commuted to five years' imprisonment. The castle of Velika Kladuša surrendered on 20 October. Tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly Herzegovina) and a mass emigration of predominantly Muslim dissidents occurred. However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a \\"model colony\\". With the aim of establishing the province as a stable political model that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and generally to provide for modernization.  Results  The Austro-Hungarian Empire was forced to use five corps with a collective strength of 153,300 soldiers and 112 guns to subdue Bosnia and Herzegovina. The General Staff estimated there were 79,000 armed insurgents assisted (illegally) by 13,800 regular Ottoman soldiers with about 77 guns. Total Austro-Hungarian losses were about 5,000: 946 dead, 272 missing, and 3,980 wounded. Austro-Hungarian casualties amounted to over 5,000 and the unexpected violence of the campaign led to recriminations between commanders and political leaders. There is no reliable estimate of Bosnian or Ottoman losses. During the campaign, an article in the German-language Hungarian newspaper Pester Lloyd criticising the army's preparedness for the occupation was censored on the orders of King-Emperor Franz Joseph. Legacy There is an exhibition in the Museum of Military History in Vienna about the 1878 campaign. It contains several items from the personal property of General Filipović, an insurgent banner and captured Ottoman weapons.

Pilon fractures are caused by rotational or axial forces, mostly as a result of falls from a height or motor vehicle accidents. Pilon fractures are rare, comprising 3 to 10 percent of all fractures of the tibia and 1 percent of all lower extremity fractures, but they involve a large part of the weight-bearing surface of the tibia in the ankle joint. Because of this, they may be difficult to fixate and are historically associated with high rates of complications and poor outcome. Pilon is the French word for \\"pestle\\" and was introduced into orthopedic literature in 1911 by pioneer French radiologist Étienne Destot.  Classification Pilon fractures are categorized by two main X-ray schemes, Ruedi-Allgower classification system. and Müller AO Classification of fractures.  Treatment  The treatment of pilon fractures depends on the extent of the injury. This includes the involvement of other bones such as the fibula and the talus, involvement of soft tissue, and the fracture pattern. Treatment strategies and fixation methods used include internal and external fixation, as well as staged approaches, with the aim of reducing the fracture, reconstructing the involved bones and restoration of articular surface congruence, with minimal insult to soft tissues. Appropriate wound management is important to reduce the high rate of infectious complications and secondary wound healing problems associated with open pilon fractures. Vacuum-assisted wound closure therapy and using a staged protocol (awaiting soft-tissue recovery before extensive reconstructive efforts) may play a positive role.

Leaders from the 72nd New York recruited men from New Jersey, as well as from cities and small towns across the State of New York. Service Raised by former U.S. Congressman Daniel Sickles, under authority of the U.S. War Department on May 18, 1861, the 72nd New York Infantry was organized at Camp Scott on Staten Island, New York with its members mustering in there from June through November 1861.\\"72nd Regiment, New York Infantry\\", in \\"Union New York Volunteers\\", in \\"Battle Unit Details\\", in \\"The Civil War\\".

Part of Sickles' Excelsior Brigade, the 72nd New York participated in many of the war's most significant battles. Transported to Washington, D.C., the members of this regiment were initially attached to Division of the Potomac (Sickles' Brigade), and assigned to defend the city before participating in the Union Army's expedition to lower Maryland (September 15–October 2, 1861). They were then reassigned as Sickles' Brigade to the U.S. Army of the Potomac in October as part of the division commanded by Brigadier-General Joseph Hooker. Their next significant deployment came as part of the U.S. Army's Third Corps, Second Division when they engaged in the Union Army's advance on Manassas, Virginia (March 10, 1862), the expedition from Dumfries to Fredericksburg, capture of stores (March 18), and reconnoissance from Liverpool Point to Stafford Court House and subsequent operations there (April 4). Reassigned to the Peninsula Campaign, they then participated in the Siege of Yorktown, Virginia (April 5–May 4, 1862), and incurred heavy casualties in the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5). By the time that battle was over, nearly 200 members of the regiment had been killed or wounded, a loss rate which the regiment would not experience again for the remainder of the war. Next engaged in the Battle of Seven Pines/Fair Oaks (May 31–June 1), the regiment then fought in the Seven Days Battles at Oak Grove (June 25), the Peach Orchard and Savage's Station (June 29), White Oak Swamp and Glendale (June 30), and Malvern Hill (July 1 and August 5). Transferred from the Peninsula during the fall of 1862, the regiment saw heavy action in the Union's Manassas Station Operations (August 25–27) and the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28–30).\\"72nd Regiment, New York Infantry\\", in \\"The Civil War\\", U.S. National Park Service, retrieved online October 4, 2018.\\"72nd Infantry Regiment: Civil War: Third Regiment, Excelsior, or Sickles', Brigade\\", New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.

During this phase of duty, the 72nd New York lost nearly one-fourth of its members in the intense combat of the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 7, including the regiment's commanding officer, Colonel William O.

Union Gen. Daniel Sickles rides past his staff to inspect the front lines of the III Corps at the Peach Orchard salient during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863). Assigned next to the Gettysburg Campaign, the 72nd New York fought in the Battle of Gettysburg under the command of Colonel John Austin. Positioned near the Emmettsburg Road, the regiment was forced to retreat when the Third Corps was routed from its advance position. By the time the second day's fight was over, Austin and one-third of the regiment had become casualties, as had Sickles, the regiment's founder, whose leg was so badly damaged by a stray cannon ball that it required amputation. When the engagement was over, the regiment was ordered to pursue Confederate troops from Gettysburg into Maryland and Virginia, and re-engaged with the enemy in the battles of Wapping Heights (July 23), Bristoe Station (October 14) and Kelly's Ford (November 7), as well as in the Mine Run Campaign (November 27–December 2).\\"72nd Regiment, New York Infantry\\", in \\"The Civil War\\", U.S. National Park Service, retrieved online October 4, 2018.\\"72nd Infantry Regiment: Civil War: Third Regiment, Excelsior, or Sickles', Brigade\\", New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.

Childs is an American politician who served on the Greenwood, South Carolina, county council. President Barack Obama has credited her with coining his campaign slogan: \\"Fired up! Ready to go!\\" Background Childs was born in 1949 in South Carolina. She attended Brewer High School in Greenwood, where she studied health; and graduated in 1967. After retiring as a licensed practical nurse she became local activist in her community. She started an anonymous hotline in Greenwood County to help seniors who were being preyed on by criminals and feared retribution if they called police. After retiring as a licensed practical nurse, she studied criminal justice and became a private investigator. Political career In 1994, Childs ran for an at-large seat on the Greenwood School District 50 board of trustees. She served on the school board until 1998. In 1999 she ran for and won a seat on the Greenwood County Council, representing District 1. Much of her efforts have centered on establishing after school programs for the community's youth, providing holiday meals for the unemployed, obtaining funding for a new rec center and providing school supplies for underprivileged youth. =Controversy= In July 2013, the South Carolina ethics commission leveled a fine against Childs for what it found to be inappropriate spending of \\"in district\\" funds. The commission found that she used $100 to make personal donations to nonprofits outside Greenwood County. One of the contributions was $50 paid to put an advertisement in the program for a local beauty pageant. 2008 Presidential primary In June 2007, then-Senator and presidential hopeful Barack Obama visited the small town of Greenwood, South Carolina (population 29,000) as part of his campaign efforts. When he arrived at the town's civic center, late at night and in a driving rain, he was surprised to find a room of only 30 supporters. Childs, noticing the look on the candidate's face, yelled out to those assembled, \\"Fired up!\\" The room responded, \\"Fired up!\\" Obama, surprised by the enthusiasm, turned around to see Childs as she continued, \\"Ready to go!\\", to which the room again responded, \\"Ready to go!\\" Soon after the campaign stop in Greenwood, the same chant was repeated at a larger Obama rally in Aiken, South Carolina (see the Aiken video here:). Before long, volunteers were carrying signs and wearing shirts printed with the slogan. The national press picked up on the craze; CNN interviewed her in Greenwood, and the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post also interviewed her. She flew to New York to appear on CBS. When a Japanese reporter wrote a story on her, in Japanese, the president of Greenwood’s Fujifilm plant translated it for her.http://www.thestate.com/2012/09/06/2427803/greenwood-activist-still- fired.html In December 2009, almost a year after he assumed office, President Obama invited Childs to the White House for the first holiday celebration hosted by the Obamas. 2012 Presidential primary Childs was chosen by her party to be part of the South Carolina delegation to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. There she led the 'fired up\\" chant again, but this time in front of 20,000 delegates and their guests and a national TV audience.

Born in Nova Scotia's Musquodoboit Valley, Bruce spent some time in the United States, likely teaching in Boston for a period. In her 30s, she returned to Nova Scotia where she attended the Normal School in Truro, earning a diploma and, in 1883, a first-class license. That same year, she started teaching at Lockman Street School in Halifax, a segregated school for black girls. The next year, the school was merged with the Maynard Street School, creating a coeducational, but still segregated, school, and Bruce was appointed principal. In 1884 the city's black residents had, after years of protests and campaigning, gained the right to attend integrated primary schools rather than one of the two segregated schools (the other school was in Africville). As the white principal of a segregated school, Bruce was viewed with suspicion by the black community. She was charged with assaulting a pupil in 1886 (she won the case), and was investigated by the school board after letters she wrote to the board, in which she referred to her students as \\"darkeys\\", were made public. The investigation exonerated Bruce, but she resigned her position in 1892. When she reapplied in 1893, the board, despite its earlier decision, declined to hire her. The school supervisor, in protest, offered her a substitute teaching position at the Albro Street School. She remained there until 1901, then transferred to the Acadian School on Argyle Street, once again a principal. Bruce remained principal of the Acadian School until her death in 1907.

It passes through the Dzungarian Gate into Kazakhstan, and moves through Russia, Belarus and Poland before arriving in Duisburg. The railway is part of a growing rail network connecting China and Europe along the New Silk Road. Background According to the European Commission, as of March 2014, the EU is China's biggest trading partner. Rail transport is becoming increasingly important for trade between Europe and China as the latter promotes industrial hubs in cities further inland in its territory.

It is the seventh track from their sixth studio album, Ghost Stories. Composition The song is an acoustic ballad that has been described as channelling Coldplay's earlier works, Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head. The song is predominantly played with an acoustic guitar and a steady electronic drum beat, with a light orchestra accompanying the song towards the end. The song's second half merges into the next track from the album, A Sky Full of Stars. The song's lyrics, which share the same motif as the rest of the songs featured on Ghost Stories, deal with a troubled relationship. Recording The song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose- built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and Mylo Xyloto respectively. Reception \\"Oceans\\" received positive reception upon its debut during the band's appearance on Live Lounge. Carolyn Menyes of Music Times, who described the song as \\"dreamy\\", wrote a positive review of the song, describing it further as \\"sleepy, comforting and straight up pretty in all the right ways; at least on the surface\\". Bruna Nessif of E! also wrote positively of Martin's performance of the song, writing that \\"there are notes Martin hits that are just incredible, and they sound just as amazing as they do while playing on repeat on your radio at home\\". Carl Williott of Idolator, upon mentioning comparisons of the song to Parachutes, wrote that the song \\"is the first track that truly feels like it could've come from a Parachutes session. There's hardly a hook to be found, but it's a lovely, slightly forlorn sway of a song, with an acoustic guitar anchoring Chris Martin's meandering falsetto amidst some swirling atmospherics\\". Alex Young of Consequence of Sound jokingly stated that the song would \\"make for a good Starbucks soundtrack\\". Live performances \\"Oceans\\" was first performed by the band during their appearance on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge program on 23 April 2014, alongside \\"Magic\\". A video of the performance was uploaded onto the official BBC Radio 1 YouTube channel the same day as the airing of the performance. The performance was featured on many music magazines and websites, with some noting Martin's performance of the song, playing the acoustic guitar without his wedding ring; the first time since his separation from Gwyneth Paltrow.

She is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy (Emerita) at Stony Brook University. Her primary interests include feminist philosophy, ethics, social and political theory, metaphor, and the application of these disciplines to disability studies. Kittay has also attempted to bring philosophical concerns into the public spotlight, including leading The Women's Committee of One Hundred in 1995, an organization that opposed the perceived punitive nature of the social welfare reforms taking place in the United States at the time. Education and career Kittay received her bachelor's degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1967, and went on to receive her doctoral degree from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1978. After receiving her doctorate, she accepted a position as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park for the 1978-9 year, before accepting a permanent position at Stony Brook University in 1979 as Assistant Professor. Kittay was promoted to Associate Professor in 1986, and full Professor in 1993. Kittay received a Distinguished Professorship from Stony Brook in 2009. Kittay is also a Senior Fellow at the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care, and Bioethics at Stony Brook, and a Women's Studies Associate. In addition to these permanent positions, Kittay has accepted a variety of temporary appointments, including ones at Sarah Lawrence College and Newcastle University. She has received numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, and NEH Fellowship, and the Lebowitz Prize for philosophical achievement and contribution from the American Philosophical Association and Phi Beta Kappa. She has also been recognized for her writing on disability by the Institute Mensch, Ethiks, und Wissenshaft, The Center for Discovery and IncludeNYC. She was named Women of the Year by the Society for Women in Philosophy 2003-2004. She served as the President of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, 2016-2017.  Research areas  Kittay's research has focused on feminist philosophy, ethics, social and political theory, the philosophy of disability, metaphor, and the application of these disciplines to disability studies. Her viewpoints on the ethics of care are quite similar to those of Virginia Held and Sara Ruddick - namely that human interactions occur between people who are unequal yet interdependent, and that practical ethics should be fitted to life as most people experience it. Kittay has also extended the work of John Rawls to address the concerns of women and the cognitively disabled. In developing the ethics of care, her most significant contribution has been the emphasis on the inevitable fact of human dependency and the need to incorporate such dependency and dependency work into ethical and political theories.

The origins of the current flag of Puerto Rico, adopted by the commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1952, can be traced to 1868, when the first Puerto Rican flag, \\"The Revolutionary Flag of Lares\\", was conceived by Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and embroidered by Mariana \\"Brazos de Oro\\" Bracetti. This flag was used in the short-lived Puerto Rican revolt against Spanish rule in the island, known as \\"El Grito de Lares\\".\\"Puerto Rico - Cinco Siglos de Historia\\"; by: Francisco Sacrano; publisher: McGraw Hill Interamericana, SA, 1993; pag. 533 Juan de Mata Terreforte, an exiled veteran of \\"El Grito de Lares\\" and Vice-President of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, in New York City, adopted with its members the flag of Lares as the flag of Puerto Rico, until 1895, when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee. The new flag, which consisted of five equal horizontal bands of red (top and bottom) alternating with white; a blue isosceles triangle based on the hoist side bears a large, white, five-pointed star in the center, was first flown in Puerto Rico on March 24, 1897, during the \\"Intentona de Yauco\\" revolt. (This is contrasted by the usage of three blue and two white equal horizontal stripes and a red equilateral triangle at the hoist with a five-pointed star in the Cuban flag.) The use and display of the Puerto Rican flag was outlawed and the only flags permitted to be flown in Puerto Rico were the Spanish flag (1492 to 1898) and the American flag (1898 to 1952). In 1952, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico adopted the 1895 flag design as its official standard. The color of the triangle that was used by the administration of Luis Muñoz Marín was the dark blue.Flags of the World; Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 In 1995, the government of Puerto Rico issued a regulation regarding the use of the Puerto Rican flag titled: \\"Regulation on the Use in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of the Flag of Puerto Rico\\" (), in which the government specifies the colors to be used but does not specify any official color tones or shades. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see the flag of Puerto Rico with different shades of blue displayed in the island.Reglamento sobre el Uso en Puerto Rico de la Bandera del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico(Spanish), Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Retrieved on Feb. 25, 2009 History =Spanish era= Captain's Ensign of Columbus's Ships. The introduction of a flag in Puerto Rico can be traced to when Christopher Columbus landed on the island's shore and with the flag appointed to him by the Spanish Crown claimed the island, which he named \\"San Juan Bautista\\", in the name of Spain. Columbus wrote in his logbook that on October 12, 1492, he used the Royal Flag, and that his captains used two flags which the Admiral carried in all the ships as ensign, each white with a green cross in the middle and an 'F' and 'Y', both green and crowned with golden, open royal crowns, for Ferdinand II of Aragon and Ysabel (Isabel I).Enchanted Learning, Zoom Explorers, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 The conquistadores under the command of Juan Ponce de León proceeded to conquer and settle the island. They carried as their military standard the \\"Spanish Expedition Flag\\". After the island was conquered and colonized, the flag of Spain was used in Puerto Rico, same as it was used in all of its other colonies. Once the Spanish armed forces established themselves on the island they began the construction of military fortifications such as La Fortaleza, Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Cristóbal and San Gerónimo. The Spanish Army designed the \\"Cross of Burgundy Flag\\" and adopted it as their standard.

The independence movement in Puerto Rico gained momentum with the liberation successes of Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín in South America. In 1868, local independence leader Ramón Emeterio Betances urged Mariana Bracetti to knit a revolutionary flag using the flag of the Dominican Republic as an example, promoting the then popular ideal of uniting the three caribbean islands into an Antillean Confederation. The materials for the flag were provided by Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue with a white star in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross on it stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom. The \\"Revolutionary Flag of Lares\\" was used in the short- lived rebellion against Spain in what became known as El Grito de Lares (The Cry of Lares).Peres Moris, José, Historia de la Insurrección de Lares, 1871 , Library of Congress, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 The flag was proclaimed the national flag of the \\"Republic of Puerto Rico\\" by Francisco Ramírez Medina, who was sworn in as Puerto Rico's first president, and placed on the high altar of the Catholic Church of Lares, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican Flag. The original Lares flag was taken by a Spanish army officer as a war prize. Many years later it was returned and transferred to the Puerto Rican people. It is now exhibited in the University of Puerto Rico's Museum. Lares revolutionary flag of 1868, also known as the \\"First Puerto Rican Flag\\" in Puerto Rico In 1873, following the abdication of Amadeo I of Spain and with Spain's change from Kingdom to Republic, the Spanish government issued a new colonial flag for Puerto Rico. The new flag, which was used until 1873, resembled the flag of Spain, with the difference that it had the coat of arms of Puerto Rico in the middle. Spain's flag once more flew over Puerto Rico with the restoration of the Spanish kingdom in 1874, until 1898 the year that the island became a possession of the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1898) in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.Popular Expression and National Identity in Puerto Rico: The Struggle for Self, Community, and Nation; by Lillian Guerra; Pg. 200; Publisher: University Press of Florida; 1st edition (June 30, 1998); ; =Current design= Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee (standing L-R) Manuel Besosa, Aurelio Méndez Martínez, and Sotero Figueroa (seated L-R) Juan de M.

He joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee and was named its Vice-President. Terreforte and the members of the Revolutionary Committee adopted the Flag of Lares as their standard. In 1892, the Committee was presented with the design of the current flag of Puerto Rico. The new flag's design has been attributed to various Puerto Ricans who were members of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. Some sources document Francisco Gonzalo Marín with presenting a Puerto Rican flag prototype in 1895 for adoption by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. Marín has since been credited by some with the flag's design.\\"Latin America's Wars Volume I: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791-1899\\"; by Robert L. Scheina; Pg. 359; Publisher: Potomac Books Inc.; 1 edition (January 2003); ; There is a letter written by Juan de Mata Terreforte which gives credit to Marin. The original contents of the letter in Spanish are the following: :\\"La adopción de la bandera cubana con los colores invertidos me fue sugerida por el insigne patriota Francisco Gonzalo Marín en una carta que me escribió desde Jamaica. Yo hice la proposición a los patriotas puertorriqueños que asistieron al mitin de Chimney Hall y fue aprobada unánimemente.\\" Which translated in English states the following: :\\"The adoption of the Cuban flag with inverted colors was suggested to me by the distinguished patriot Francisco Gonzalo Marín in a letter he wrote to me from Jamaica. I made the proposal to the Puerto Rican patriots who attended the meeting at Chimney Hall and it was approved unanimously.\\" According to other accounts on June 12, 1892, disputed by scholar Armando Martí, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then took a look at the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited José Martí as a guest. Martí was pleasantly impressed by the prototype, and made note of it in a newspaper article published in the Cuban revolutionary newspaper Patria, published on July 2 of that year. Acceptance of the prototype was slow in coming, but grew with time. Francisco Gonzalo Marín, who decided to have a proper flag sewn based on the prototype, presented the new flag's design in New York's \\"Chimney Corner Hall\\" a gathering place of independence advocates two years later. The Puerto Rican Flag (with the light blue triangle) soon came to symbolize the ideals of the Puerto Rican independence movement.Antonio Vélez Alvarado, amigo y colaborador consecuente de Martí y Betances, Author: Dávila, Ovidio; pp. 11-13.; Publisher: San Juan, P.R. : Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture), 2002.

This created a belief that her father could have been its designer. In her letter she described the flag as one which consists of five stripes that alternate from red to white. Three of the stripes are red, and the other two are white. To the left of the flag is a light blue triangle that houses one white five-pointed star. Each part of this flag has its own meaning. The three red stripes represent the blood from the brave warriors. The two white stripes represent the victory and peace that they would have after gaining independence. The white star represented the island of Puerto Rico. The blue represents the sky and blue coastal waters. The triangle represents the three branches of government.Puerto Rico, Welcome to Puerto Rico, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 Finally, it is also believed by some that it was Lola Rodríguez de Tió who suggested that Puerto Ricans use the Cuban flag with its colors reversed as the model for their own standard.Lola Rodríguez de Tió, Library of Congress, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 The color of the Cuban flag's blue stripes, however, were a darker shade of blue, according to Professor Martí.

In 1932, the Nationalist Party used the flag as its emblem during the elections and in their parades. On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the island. The Senate, controlled by the Partido Popular Democrático (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jurídica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintrón This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, was enacted under the name Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) on June 10, 1948, when signed by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. Later that same year Puerto Ricans were permitted to elect a governor and they elected Luis Muñoz Marín. During the Jayuya Uprising of 1950 against United States rule, members of the Nationalist party placed the Puerto Rican flag on top of the town hall; the flag was later taken down by a soldier. =Formal adoption= In 1952, Governor Luis Muñoz Marín and his administration adopted the Puerto Rican flag which was originally designed in 1892, and proclaimed it the official flag of Puerto Rico. The official adaptation of the flag has been interpreted by some as a ploy by Muñoz Marin to neutralize the independence movement in his own party.\\"Puerto Rico: Culture, Politics, and Identity\\"; by Nancy Morris, Published by Praeger/Greenwood 1995; .

His primary emphasis was in the area of computer-human interface (CHI) design. His goal was to make computers easier for ordinary people to use, and therefore more valuable to them. Personal life and influence Smith was born in Roanoke, Virginia on March 29, 1945. Smith graduated from Chillicothe (Ohio) High School in 1963 and was inducted into the Chillicothe High School Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame in 2007 =Oberlin College= Smith attended Oberlin College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1967. During the last semester of his senior year, Smith realized he didn't want to pursue a career as a mathematics professor. Smith gained interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) after reading Computers and Thought by Edward A. Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman. In his eyes, AI was the future of computing and he wanted to be involved. =Stanford University= In 1967 he began pursuing his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford University. At Stanford he wanted to develop a computer able to learn. He turned to Alan Kay, a computer science assistant professor at Stanford who also worked in the AI lab, for help. Kay was interested in creating machines that helped make people smarter. Smith shared this same interest and asked Kay to be his thesis advisor. Kay agreed. In one of their first meetings to discuss the thesis (he hadn't yet thought of a topic), Kay handed Smith a stack of books on art and philosophy, including Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field by Jacques Hadamard, Visual Thinking by Rudolf Arnheim, and The Act of Creation by Arthur Koestler. Kay believed that ideas outside of Computer Science were essential to the advance of the field and wanted to share this with Smith. Eventually, Smith also read Art and Illusion by Ernst Gombrich, which came to be one of the most influential books in his life during this time. By reading this book, Smith realized that people were used to certain conventions and if he strayed too far from these conventions with his new ideas, people would not accept or understand them. This helped shape his approach on innovative interaction techniques and integrating the computer into the common workplace. Smith finished his Ph.D in 1975.Lecture on Human-Computer Interaction, Carnegie Mellon., February 2014 Career timeline 1963-1967: Pursued a B.S. in Mathematics at Oberlin College 1967-1975: Pursued a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford University – During this time, Smith also worked at Xerox PARC where he contributed to the Alto computer and helped develop Smalltalk, an object-oriented programming language, with Kay. 1975-1976: Programmer in Douglas Englebart’s Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) – Smith was originally drawn to SRI because of the many papers coming out of the Augmentation Research Center and Englebart's The Mother of All Demos. However, he didn't feel as if he was doing the similar cutting-edge research like he was at Stanford and left. 1976-1983: User Interface Designer at Xerox in the Xerox Systems Development Division – Smith was one of the 6 principal designers for the Xerox Star computer. 1983-1984: User Interface Designer at VisiCorp – At the time, Smith joined VisiCorp, it was larger than Microsoft and produced four of the top ten best selling personal computer applications - including VisiCalc. He joined VisiCorp because he admired VisiCalc inventors Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin. Similar to them, he wanted to contribute to the world of laymen personal computers. Consequently, he prototyped a new application that was going to do for relational databases, what current spreadsheets did for financial modelling. Unfortunately, VisiCorp went out of business before he could fully execute his prototype. Smith describes this as one of the biggest disappointments of his career. 1984-1985: Cofounder, System Architect, & User Interface Designer at Dest Systems – Smith, and other former employees of VisiCorp, formed a start-up under the umbrella of Dest Corporation to combine Dest's OCR reader with mass storage devices, such as optical disks to transform large amounts of paper documentation into a searchable and editable electronic form. The team was influenced by statistics such as the documentation for the Boeing 747 weighed more than the airplane itself. Again, Smith and his team prototyped the product but Dest went out of business before they could fully execute it. 1985-1988: Cofounder and Vice President of Human Interfaces at Cognition – This was a Massachusetts start-up that attempted to do for mechanical engineers what workstations, such as Daisy's and Mentor Graphics, did for electrical engineers. Architecturally, it was based on Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad; it used constraint-based geometry to portray mechanical devices such as the windshield raising-lowering mechanism in a car. The dimensions, angles, and other measurements in the diagrams were linked to mathematical formulas. When the values in the formulas changed, the diagrams automatically updated to represent the changes. Smith designed a simple interface modeled on an engineer's notebook. It had sketchnotes for the diagrams, math notes for the formulas, text notes for textual descriptions, etc., which could then be pasted into the pages of the notebook. It was a modular design that made it easy to include new note types as users thought of them. The product was finished and sold, but Cognition was never profitable and went out of business largely due to the increasing power of low-cost personal computers using Intel chips. However, the interface was successful and won a General Motors competition; it was recognized for its standardized interface across all workstation software. 1988-1996: User Interface Designer at Apple – Smith worked in Apple's Advanced Technology Group where he and Allen Cypher invented KidSim, with important contributions by Alan Kay. 1996-2002: Cofounder and User Interface Designer of Stagecast – After the KidSim Project was terminated at Apple, Smith and some of his former coworkers at Apple formed the company Stagecast and renamed KidSim to Creator. Stagecast went out of business due to a lack of funding. 2002-2003: Human-computer interface designer at IBM 2004-2009: Retired – Smith and his wife Janet traveled the country in an RV. He is currently writing a book about their travels. 2010-current: Still retired. Living in Bend, Oregon. Enjoying hiking, camping, skiing, reading, and photography. Especially enjoying Pygmalion Pygmalion is the name of Smith's thesis, finished in 1975 at Stanford. Smith and his colleagues would often come together to discuss and draw different concepts on a blackboard. They would work out fully sketched diagrams and then sit down and begin translating these diagrams into programming language that a computer could recognize. This method produced many errors and Smith wanted to reduce these by creating a way to transfer the blackboard sketches directly to the computer. He viewed this as an executable electronic blackboard.Smith, David. \\"Pygmalion: A Creative Programming Environment\\", 1975. Smith named this system Pygmalion after the famous sculptor Pygmalion from Roman mythology. Originally, Pygmalion was implemented in Smalltalk on the Xerox Alto computer. Pygmalion introduced two new key innovations: the concept of a computer icon and programming by example (PbE). Since then, icons have become a widely accepted, but programming by example is still waiting to be proven as a valid concept among the masses. =The development of icons= When creating Pygmalion, Smith wanted objects that could be directly manipulated in the system. Smith was inspired by the belief within certain religions, that images portraying holy figures embody some of the holiness of that figure. Smith viewed the objects in Pygmalion as having both visual and mechanical schematics that they represent. He saw a religious icon and the objects he was drawing as having the same double meaning, thus he named these objects icons. Xerox Star Smith served as a user interface designer for the Xerox System Development Division between 1976 and 1983. His role as one of the six principal designers for the Xerox Star constitute his main contributions to the field of human-computer interaction. The other five designers were Larry Clark, Eric Harslem, Charles Irby, Ralph Kimball, and Jim Reilly. While working on the Star, Smith helped develop four main features: the desktop metaphor, dialog boxes, the icon designs, and universal commands. =Desktop metaphor= The desktop metaphor is the representation of common office objects in a computer's user interface. Smith and his colleagues were trying to develop a computer for the office. Prior computers were not tailored to the office and what Smith called \\"knowledge workers\\". He made a distinction between how these knowledge workers and secretaries - who were the common computer users at the time - wanted to use a computer. To introduce a computer that knowledge workers could easily understand and interact with, Smith believed it was imperative to incorporate objects and ideas they were already familiar with. This led him to represent common office items, such as documents, folders, file cabinets, and wastebaskets, in his icon designs for the Star.\\"The Star User Interface: An Overview\\", , Proceedings from the AFIPS 1982 National Computer Conference.Xerox Star user interface demonstration, 1982Final demo of the Xerox Star, 1998 =Dialog boxes= A dialog box is a small window that contain clickable options, allowing users to communicate a command to the computer. By presenting a list of options within these boxes, users don't need to memorize them. =Icons= Smith designed the initial icons of the office icons for Xerox Star. As development on the Star progressed and drew closer to completion, he and the other designers decided that the icons needed a more professional look. The six of them began interviewing graphic design artists that could polish his initial drafts. They soon met Norm Cox - an artist already working for Xerox in Dallas, Texas. After Cox created several new sets of the icons, they conducted user tests to finalize which set would be more appropriate for the Star system. These tests were used to determine which of the different sets were most aesthetically pleasing, identifiable to the real world object they represented - such as a printer or mailbox - and how fast users could locate a given type of icon in a screen full of them. =Universal commands= A universal command is a command that work in all applications of a system. In Smith's own words, “This simplifies the system as a whole without reducing its power. Some of the universal commands for the Star were: Again, Copy, Copy Properties, Delete, Move, Show Properties, and Undo.  Apple =KidSim= For eight years, Alan Kay, Allen Cypher, and Smith worked closely together in the Advanced Technology Group to find a way to teach children how to program. During this project, they faced two main issues. The first issue was how to input programs without boring or overwhelming students and the second was how to understand how a program works once it is written. Their efforts were ultimately successful and they developed a system called KidSim (for Kids' Simulations). The system enabled children as young as preschoolers to program video games that other children could play. =Component software= One of Smith's side projects at Apple was component software. In hardware, the designer does not descend to the level of individual transistors and resistors, but rather, goes to a component catalogue, selects a set of integrated circuits, and pieces them together. However, in software, the designer deals with the lowest level elements: conditional statements, variables, and procedure calls. Sometimes a library will provide predefined routines that can be called, thereby saving the designer the work of implementing them. However, these libraries often don't do what is needed or they cannot be used properly. Component software attempted to enable software components for use in an analogous way with hardware components. Like many of Smith's other projects, it did not continue past the prototype stage. =OpenDoc= Another one of Smith's side projects was OpenDoc. Apple wanted to implement a new document architecture. In OpenDoc, a user could write documents using an open-ended collection of multimedia components. The architecture was flexible enough to allow new types of components to be included as people thought of them. For this project, Smith acted as the user interface consultant and contributed a new universal command: Link. Link would later be added to the list of universal commands such as cut, copy, paste, and undo, that worked with all components. Link established a dynamic connection between components. For example, between a spreadsheet component and a database component, when a change was made in one of these components, the same change was made it the other. This command reduced the amount of manual updating needed to change materials and provided a significant increase in functionality with almost no increase in complexity. Unfortunately, OpenDoc was quickly discontinued. =Extensible programming language= Finally, Smith designed a new extensible programming language for use within the Advanced Technology Group. This language used the PLisp technology previously developed by Larry Tesler, Horace Enea, and Smith at Stanford. Not only could new programming constructs be added to the language, enabling a programmer to use those constructs in a program, but such extensions could be made at compile time. That is, the programmer could include a preface at the beginning of a program which would dynamically add features just for the program that follows. However, this language was never implemented. Stagecast Creator Stagecast Creator is a visual programming language based on the concept of programming by example. It was intended to teach children how to program. Smith believed that programming was not inherently hard, but that the true problem was that computer scientists had failed to create an easier way to learn and do it. Creator was a solution to this problem. Through user testing groups of 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, Smith and his team discovered the programming language was most successful within the 5th grade groups. He believed that the 5th graders were “around the age where they didn’t have the creativity and enthusiasm crushed out of them by the education system, yet old enough to be inventive”. Smith wanted a new way to engage kids and actually teach them how to think, instead of how to memorize facts. Although the kids looked at creating simulations with Creator as making video games, Smith believed he was implicitly teaching them the scientific method. By using Creator, kids were creating theories and hypotheses, and experiments to test them, executing those experiments, and then observing the results to confirm or disprove their hypotheses. Creator is a continuation of Smith's KidSim project at Apple. In 1997, Steve Jobs eliminated the Advanced Technology Group that Smith was working for. This meant that KidSim would no longer receive funding. However, Apple gave Smith and about 12 other employees of the former Advanced Technology Group permission to continue the project on their own. In 1997, Smith and his fellow employees created a start-up, Stagecast, Inc., to continue their work with KidSim. The goal of that firm was to finish the Java implementation of KidSim and sell it as a commercial product. Soon after founding the company, KidSim was renamed Creator. The first version was finished in 2000 and the second version in 2001. , it is still available for purchase at the official Stagecast website, www.stagecast.com. However, Stagecast, Inc. went out of business in 2002 due to a lack of funding from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. In his own words, Smith said several venture capitalists told his company, \\"We love your software, and could we please have a copy for our kids? But we aren’t going to fund you because we’ve never made money on educational software.\\" Smith called the disbandment of Stagecast, Inc., the second greatest disappointment of his career. Retirement Smith and his wife Janet retired in the beginning of 2004 and from 2004-2009 toured the country viewing scenic locations and photographing historical sites. They were inspired by the travelogue Travels with Charley: In Search of America by John Steinbeck. Smith and his wife plan to publish a similar book called Travels with Janet.

South Guthrie is adjacent to the city of Guthrie, Kentucky; essentially, it is the part of the Guthrie community located south of the state line. In the Jim Crow era, South Guthrie was the African-American community associated with the white city of Guthrie, with the state line forming a dividing line between the races. The community of Guthrie was established in 1868 and experienced early growth after a railroad junction was completed in 1870. South Guthrie, which grew up alongside Guthrie, was known historically by the nicknames \\"Squiggtown\\" and \\"Niggertown\\", the latter being a pejorative used by white residents of Guthrie. In the early decades of the 20th century, residents of South Guthrie found industrial employment in a broom factory and a plant that made railroad ties. South Guthrie also had a small middle class of African-American professionals and benefited economically from African-American tobacco farmers in the surrounding \\"Black Patch\\" region. South Guthrie is still predominantly black, while Guthrie is predominantly white, although the divisions are not as sharply defined as they were historically. The building that houses the South Guthrie community center is a former Rosenwald school that was completed in 1922 and operated as a school until 1968.

It has also appeared on several live albums. It is particularly notable for the jazz trumpet breaks played by Freddie Hubbard. Lyrics and music The themes of \\"Zanzibar\\" include love of sports, love of alcohol and the singer's attempt to pick up a waitress. According to producer Phil Ramone, Joel had written the music and had decided he liked the title \\"Zanzibar\\" for the piece, but had not figured out what to say about Zanzibar. Hearing the music conjured up for Ramone images of people watching television in a bar, and as a result Joel decided to make the song about activity in a sports bar named Zanzibar rather than about the country Zanzibar. The lyrics include a number of contemporary sports references, including to heavyweight champion boxer Muhammad Ali, baseball player Pete Rose, and the baseball team the New York Yankees, who were the World Champions at the time. The lyrics also use a baseball expression as a sexual metaphor when the singer wants to steal second base with a waitress in the bar if the waitress will allow it. Joel biographer Hank Bordowitz considers the waitress to be a metaphor for Joel's first wife Elizabeth, similar to how he considers the waitress \\"practicing politics\\" in Joel's earlier song \\"Piano Man\\" to be a metaphor for Elizabeth. The song begins with a short slow section, but then moves to a shuffle rhythm. It contains two jazz trumpet solos played by the legendary jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. The song's bridge begins with a \\"dreamy\\" keyboard section, which leads into the first trumpet solo. According to Ramone, the urgency and sexiness of the trumpet part is enhanced by the ascending and descending line played on bass guitar beneath the solo. The second solo comes at the end of the song and goes into the fades out. Of playing with Hubbard, Joel stated that it \\"was a special treat for me, because I've always admired and respected jazz players.\\" Joel also recalled that after playing with Hubbard on the song, drummer Liberty DeVitto claimed that \\"Now I feel like a grown up.\\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers the melody of \\"Zanzibar\\" to be homage to Steely Dan's Donald Fagen.

The community of Warrendale, Oregon, the site of one of his canneries, was named for him. He died in the sinking of . Biography Warren was born on May 10, 1848, in Ellsworth, Maine, and came to the Oregon Territory with his parents, Francis M. Warren and Elizabeth Dyer Warren, when he was 3. The family lived on a donation land claim in Rainier, Oregon. Francis Warren (1818 – 1900) was a member of the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1857. When Frank Warren was 9, the family moved to Portland. When he was 69 he worked for Wells Fargo; he also worked for Ladd & Tilton Bank. In 1866, Warren was a member of The Pioneer Base Ball Club. Warren founded the Warren Packing Company, a salmon canning business, and was considered a pioneer of the salmon canning industry on the Columbia River, building his first cannery at Cathlamet, Washington, in 1869. He later built a cannery in Warrendale, which was also the site of a state-run fish hatchery in 1889 and 1890. Warren married Anna Sophia Atkinson, the daughter of pioneer missionary George H. Atkinson, in 1872. They had four children, Frank, Frances, George, and Anna. The Warrens were members of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Portland. In the 1890s the Warrens were active members of the church and their patronage helped acquire the land and complete the church building next to the South Park Blocks. Frank Warren was on the board of trustees of Pacific University, which was co-founded by Anna's father. By the time of the sinking of Titanic it was said Warren was a millionaire. Titanic Frank and Anna Warren boarded Titanic at Cherbourg and were traveling first class. They were returning from a three-month trip to Europe to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and were the only first- class passengers originally from Oregon on the ship.Note: Wealthy hops merchant Herman Klaber was also traveling first class after touring Europe for his company Klaber, Wolf & Netter. He was returning to his home in Portland but was originally from San Francisco and was primarily based in Washington per Anna Warren survived the sinking of Titanic on April 15, 1912, after Frank Warren helped her onto a lifeboat and then stepped back onto the ship. If Frank Warren's body was recovered from the shipwreck it was never identified. An account of Anna's experience was printed in the Morning Oregonian on April 27, 1912. Memorials and legacy There is a cenotaph for Warren in River View Cemetery in Portland. Anna died in 1925; she is buried in River View Cemetery. An Oregonian article at the time of Mrs. Warren's death states that after the Titanic disaster she suffered from ill health. Warren's son Frank M. Warren Jr. (1876–1947) also worked in the salmon packing industry, and was president of the Port of Portland, a director of Portland General Electric, and a member of the Oregon State Fish Commission. Warren's other son George worked for the Warren Packing Company as well. Homes Francis Warren's house was located at SW Salmon Street and 9th Avenue in downtown Portland; today the parking structure for the Heathman Hotel is located at the site. His son Frank's home was next door. Frank Warren owned what is now known as the George Earle Chamberlain House, built in 1893, after signing on as a trustee for his friend, wealthy banker David D. Oliphant. Governor George Earle Chamberlain bought the house in 1904. After moving from 9th and Salmon, Frank Warren Sr. moved to a home designed by Whidden & Lewis at 969 SW St. Clair Avenue (originally 215 W St. Clair Street) in Portland's West Hills. Anna was living there at the time of her death. Another Frank M. Warren House is located at 2545 NW Westover Road, it is now a bed and breakfast. It was designed by Joseph Jacobberger and built in 1904 for Frank Warren Jr. See also * A. B.

Captain Eddie is a \\"biopic\\" of Rickenbacker, from his experiences as a flying ace during World War I to his later involvement as a pioneering figure in civil aviation, and his iconic status as a business leader who was often at odds with labour unions and the government.Orriss 2013, p. 109. Plot In World War II, famed World War I pilot Eddie Rickenbacker (Fred MacMurray), while serving as a United States Army Air Forces officer, is assigned to tour South Pacific bases. On October 21, 1942, his Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress has to ditch at sea, forcing Rickenbacker, pilot Lt. James Whittaker (Lloyd Nolan), co-pilot Capt. Bill Cherry (Richard Crane) and other crew members to survive for 19 days on a tiny rubber raft. While awaiting their rescue, Rickenbacker recalls his other adventures that have highlighted a remarkable life. From his childhood in Columbus, Ohio, marked by a passion for machinery and technology, the young man becomes a celebrated race car driver, although his mother Elise (Mary Philips) and father William (Charles Bickford) have mixed feelings about his interest in cars, and eventually, aircraft. When war breaks out, Rickenbacker signs up and becomes a fighter pilot with the 94th Aero Squadron. By war's end, he has shot down more aircraft than any other American, becoming the American \\"ace-of-aces\\". After World War I, Rickenbacker marries his sweetheart Adelaide (Lynn Bari) and enters commercial aviation as an owner and great advocate for the fledgling airline industry. When war breaks out again, he is compelled to return to the military. Returning to the present predicament, he becomes the natural leader of the survivors. The ordeal leads to the death of one of the men from exposure, but Rickenbacker's ability to organize the dwindling supplies and keep up morale among the others, leads to their survival. After a three-week stay in a military hospital, Rickenbacker is able to complete his mission and is hailed as a true hero. Cast Production Spad XIII in livery of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, 94th Aero Squadron. Principal photography for Captain Eddie began in November 1944 and continued for three months on Fox's back-lot in Los Angeles. The film received cooperation of the United States Army Air Forces, primarily coming in the form of the loan of a B-17F from the AAF's First Motion Picture Unit in Culver City, California. Crash survivor Lt. James Whittaker was also temporarily assigned to the production to serve as a technical advisor. Scenes of the ditching were done in a studio water tank, using the mock-up fuselage of a B-17.Orriss 2013, p. 110. For the World War I aerial scenes, the flying aircraft included a SPAD S.VII, Thomas-Morse Scout, Curtiss JN-4 and a pair of Nieuport 28s.Hardwick and Schnepf 1983, p. 54. Aerial coordinator Paul Mantz also loaned a Curtiss Pusher, flown from the Santa Rosa fairgrounds, serving as a pre-World War I airfield. Reception The world premiere for Captain Eddie was held in Rickenbacker's hometown of Columbus, Ohio, attended by a select mixture of politicians and celebrities, including the actress Carole Landis.Gans 2008, pp. 147–148. Family members were also in attendance.Orriss 2013, p. 111. Reviews for the film were mixed, with most critics seeing it as a romanticized biography of a famous and controversial figure. Bosley Crowther in his review for The New York Times dismissed the effort as \\"not the story it promises to be\\" \\"... just another sentimental comedy about a kid who jumped off the barn in his youthful passion for flying and courted his girl in a merry Oldsmobile ... this is not the story of Rickenbacker— not the significant story, anyhow.

The couple operated a farm where they worked as horse trainers and dressage instructors. After bringing back clogs for their farm staff on several trips to Denmark, Cabot and Kjellerup decided to establish Dansko in 1990. Dansko has since added several shoe styles, including sandals, boots, heels, flats, and more types of clogs. Inc. Magazine named Dansko in its list of 500 fastest-growing private companies in 1999 and 2000. In 2012, 80% of Dansko's shoes were made in China; 20% in Italy. In early years, the company worked with a Danish partner and manufactured shoes in Europe (including Poland). Beginning in 1995, the company attempted to manufacture some product in the US but challenges related to lack of expertise in the labor force were deemed insurmountable and much manufacturing was shifted to China.http://www.heraldextra.com/business/national-and-international/u-s-- based-dansko-struggles-to-produce-shoes- at/article_8a78a71d-5f92-5c32-9959-d877e71dd0ef.html In an effort to increase operational efficiency, Dansko opened a new, larger facility with 46 Kiva robots to assist with processing order fulfillment needs in November 2012. Also, at the new facility, distance walked by employees during a workday decreased. The Dansko Foundation, a non-profit run by employees, was founded in 2003. In 2005, Dansko launched its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which fosters employee ownership. The company was able to buy back all previously-issued stock and operate as a completely employee owned company by 2012. In 2007, Dansko started selling beyond North America, with vendors in Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Europe. Dansko is sold at 2,500 retailers which include department stores, shoe stores, and online retailers. In July 2014, Dansko clogs were featured in a photo displaying the Normcore fashion trend alongside Dolce & Gabbana. Today Style featured Dansko's Trista clog as one of the most comfy shoes. In September 2014, Dansko was recognized on B Corp's \\"Best for Workers\\" list. Shoe features Dansko clogs feature anatomically contoured arch support, a rocker-bottom sole and a slightly raised heel. These features are meant to offer increased shock absorbency, extra stability and ease leg and back muscles of wearers who stand or walk for many hours a day. Dansko shoes are particularly popular with occupational professionals who spend most of the day on their feet, like teachers, chefs, and those in the medical field, but are also worn by others for comfort and support. Most Dansko shoes have the Seal of Acceptance from the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) and many styles are slip-resistant. Footwear Plus Magazine has awarded Dansko with the \\"Plus Award\\" in the Women's Comfort category eight times. Dansko Foundation The Dansko Foundation is a nonprofit corporation founded in 2003 to benefit philanthropy, voluntarism, and grant making foundations. The Dansko Foundation is staffed by Dansko employees, who are given 20 hours of paid time off a year with which to volunteer. Dansko also makes a charitable donation equal to the employee's salary for hours an employee volunteered. Certifications The Delaware Valley Green Building Council and the American Sustainable Business Council have recognized Dansko's environmental efforts. Both Dansko's headquarters and distribution center are LEED certified buildings. Dansko has been a B-Corporation certified company since December 2007. The American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) has awarded many Dansko shoe styles its Seal of Acceptance, which recognizes products that promote quality foot health.

It is located about north of Cue and south west of Meekatharra in the Mid West region of Western Australia. The old townsite of Tuckanarra is situated within the station boundaries. The property occupies an area of , with frontage along the Great Northern Highway and the Jungar River and its tributaries. The property has numerous wells and bores at a shallow depth and the creek systems provide extensive floodout country that supports mulga shrubland and perennial grasses such as buffel. The maximum carrying capacity is approximately 8,050 sheep. The homestead, which is the old Tuckanarra hotel, and shearers' quarters have been upgraded and offer tourist accommodation. The homestead has 15 rooms in total, including five bedrooms. The station was established at some time prior to 1899 when it was placed on the market along with New Forrest Station. Together the leases occupied an area of and were carrying 3,200 sheep, 100 cattle and 40 horses. Improvements at the property included a six-room homestead, a woolshed, yards and fencing. Ben Copley acquired the property in 1918. By 1920 Copley, who also owned Mount Barnett Station in the Kimberley region, would overland cattle from Mount Barnett the to Karbar for agistment before sending them to market. James Hicks acquired the property in 1923 and had started running sheep and producing wool. Hicks died in 1944; the property was initially to be sold by the executors of Hicks' will but this was refused by the Supreme Court and Karbar was left to the Hicks' three children. The Hicks family still owned the property in 1952 and the property was still producing high quality wool attracting top prices. The Snell family acquired Karbar shortly afterward. The company headed by Dallas Dempster, Hyperion Energy, had purchased Karbar in January 2011 with the intention of building a tall solar updraft tower on the property at an estimated cost of 1.6 billion. Since acquiring Karbar the company has started to convert the property infrastructure to run cattle.

The generic name Abbottella is in honor of Dr. W. L. Abbott.This means either William Louis Abbott (1860-1936), or William James Lewis Abbott (1853-1933)  Distribution  The distribution of Abbottella includes Cuba (one species Abbottella decolorata in Guantánamo, the easternmost point on Cuba) and Hispaniola (all other species). Abbottella species are a highly endemic group of land snails living in Hispaniola with a single species in eastern Cuba. Most are known chiefly from Puerto Plata to the Samaná Peninsula in the Cordillera Septentrional that forms the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. A second, lowland group occupies the easternmost portion of the island from the coast west to Santo Domingo. A few puzzling outliers occur at Isla Beata and near Thomazeau, Haiti. Many species are known only from the type locality, or from an unknown locality, and thus their actual distributions remain unclear. Abbottella and its relatives appear to have evolved on mainland Hispaniola, and thus were not part of the Tiburon Peninsula species assemblage that was tectonically rafted to the island. Preliminary radular and phylogenetic studies clearly indicate that Abbottella and its relatives are a distinct monophyletic group apart from the rest of the Annulariidae.  Description  The genus was described by John Brooks Henderson Jr. and by Paul Bartsch in 1920. Their description reads as follows: In 1920, 8 species were classified in the genus Abbottella in 1920. There are several genera that appear to be related to Abbottella: Lagopoma, Rolleia, and Leiabbottella. Lagopoma contains a single species, Lagopoma lagopoma, which differs from Abbottella in the form of the outer lip. The genus Rolleia differs from Abbottella in lacking spiral sculpture; it consists of Rolleia martensi, Rolleia haitensis, and Rolleia oberi. Leiabbottella contains species lacking all sculpture except for finely incised axial grooves; this genus contains Leiabbottella galaxius, Leiabbottella soluta, and Leiabbottella thompsoni. Species Species within the genus Abbottella include: Subgenus Abbottella Henderson & Bartsch, 1920 The shells of species in the subgenus Abbottella are small (generally <10 mm in width), depressed, widely umbilicate and helicoid. The shell is widely expanded, often with a fimbriated peristome. Axial and spiral sculpture is usually present, usually forming cusps or serrations at the intersections. The multispiral operculum has an erect, calcified spiral lamella. The radula has a bicuspid inner marginal, in which the inner cusp is much larger than outer one. * Abbottella abbotti Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella adolfi (Pfeiffer, 1852) ** Abbottella adolfi peninsularis Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella aenea Watters, 2010 * Abbottella calliotropis Watters, 2013 * Abbottella crossei (Pilsbry, 1933) * Abbottella diadema Watters, 2013 * Abbottella dichroa Watters, 2013 * Abbottella gabbi (Crosse, 1873) * Abbottella haitensis Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella harpeza Watters & Duffy, 2010 * Abbottella mellosa Watters & Duffy, 2010 * Abbottella milleacantha Watters & Duffy, 2010 * Abbottella moreletianus (Crosse, 1873) \\\\- type species * Abbottella newcombi (Crosse, 1873) * Abbottella nitens Watters, 2013 * Abbottella rosaliae (Pfeiffer, 1858) * Abbottella samanensis Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella sanchezi Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella sosuaensis Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella tenebrosa Watters, 2013 * Abbottella tentorium (Pfeiffer, 1850) * Abbottella urbana Watters, 2012 * Abbottella wilhelmi (Pfeiffer, 1858) Subgenus Gundlachtudora Torre & Bartsch, 1941Torre C. de la & Bartsch P.

Proceedings of the United States National Museum 89: 131–385, plates 9–57. \\\\- altogether 3 species Species in the subgenus Gundlachtudora have a shell which is small in size for this family (type species ca. 9 mm maximum width, including peristome), depressed, helicoid in shape. The umbilicus is wide. The protoconch is not decollated, and consists of 11⁄4 smooth, minute whorls. Spiral sculpture is absent (or barely present in the umbilicus). Axial threads on early whorls are widely spaced, and barely perceptible. On the last whorl there is axial sculpture of microscopic, widely spaced grooves. The aperture is double, circular, adnate to the adjacent whorl, and expanded to various degrees. The operculum is multispiral with a thin, oblique lamella. * Abbottella bompardopolensis Bartsch, 1946 * Abbottella decolorata (Pfeiffer, 1859) - type species of the subgenus Gundlachtudora * Abbottella paradoxa Watters, 2013 Abbottella may be organized into five species complexes based on conchological characteristics; these groups may be worthy of subgeneric status. One complex has subdued sculpture, a globose shell with a high spire, and a metallic sheen to the shell. It occurs along the Cordillera Septentrional from Sósua to Higüey. The group consists of Abbottella mellosa and Abbottella nitens. A second complex has small, compact shells covered with numerous, minute pustules or points, the shells often white or scarcely patterned, with only moderately expanded outer lips. This group occurs in the lowlands on the southeastern coast from Santo Domingo to the easternmost portion of the island and north to the Samaná Peninsula. It consists of Abbottella milleacantha, Abbottella aenea, Abbottella tentorium, Abbottella urbana, Abbottella crossei, and Abbottella calliotropis. A third complex consists of species with rather large, openly coiled to nearly planispiral shells with pronounced prickly sculpture and widely expanded outer lips; the shells are often strongly patterned. The group contains Abbottella haitensis, and Abbottella moreletianus. Bartsch (1946) broke Abbottella moreletianus into five subspecies. Zoogeographically, this group presents a problem: the two species occur at opposite ends of the island (Thomazeau, Haiti and the Samaná Peninsula and environs). This group will be addressed in a future study. A fourth complex consists of species with small, turbinate shells, strongly sculptured with the outer lip serrate or undulating. The group is distributed in the Cordillera Septentrional from Sósua to the eastern tip of the Samaná Peninsula. It contains Abbottella rosaliae and Abbottella abbotti. Abbottella gabbi may belong to this group as well. The fifth complex consists of species with generally large, turbinate shells with minute sculpture often arranged in blocks; the outer lip is broadly expanded and the shells are usually darkly colored. It occurs along most of the Cordillera Septentrional, from Puerto Plata through the Samaná Peninsula. The group consists of Abbottella newcombi, Abbottella samanensis, Abbottella sanchezi, Abbottella adolfi, Abbottella dichroa, Abbottella tenebrosa, and Abbottella wilhelmi. The several remaining species do not fit into the above species complexes. Abbottella harpeza from Isla Beata, somewhat resembles Abbottella gabbi but occurs nearly 200 km away from any other Abbottella species. The peculiar sculpture of Abbottella diadema is so unique that this species may warrant a new genus to contain it.  Habitat  Most species are associated with limestone outcrops, often in humid forests. Even those species living in the lowlands away from the mountain ranges occur on isolated limestone ridges. Limestone deposits mainly exist on the coast, whereas the interior mountain ranges are primarily igneous and do not harbor these snails. The ranges of most species appear to be quite small; some probably occur along bluffs of ca. 20 km or less. Fortunately, some species have at least a portion of their range in protected areas such as Parque Nacional Del Este, Parque Nacional Isabel De Torres, and Parque Nacional El Choco. Despite their narrow ranges, individuals are often locally abundant.

Whatever the actual intent was, the concept was proven so effective that the command was moved to continuous salvage service at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, near the end of the Vietnam War. Scope \\"....to provide salvage repair;\\" - simply put --- the refloating of practically every conceivable type of sailing craft: sampans, small boats, barges, dredges, riverine men o'war, tugs, freighters, ad infinitum, and making temporary repairs to those craft in preparation for transit to a permanent repair facility. \\".... diving and rescue services....\\" - experienced HCU-1 divers provided the nucleus for all diving operations. Without divers, most salvage would have been impossible. They provided diving assistance to ships and shore activities and aided in the rescue and recovery of distressed persons, riverine craft, ships and aircraft anywhere their talents were needed. \\"....in rivers and restricted waters....\\" - this meant operating in muddy jungle rivers infested with repugnant life, in crisp, clear mountain streams, in polluted shipping channels and harbors, in beautiful tropical lagoons and on the high seas. \\"... and to conduct harbor and river clearance operations in the Western Pacific.\\" - navigable shipping lanes, rivers and harbors are of vital importance to military operations, and to the free flow of civilian foodstuffs and commercial goods. HCU-l was actively engaged in the clearing of channels, rivers, and harbors in the Asian countries since its commissioning. Salvage teams and salvage craft made regularly scheduled rotational deployments \\"in-country\\": 80% of Western Pacific jobs existed in/near Vietnam. The mission was vast in scope. \\"Salvage\\" to the men of HCU-l encompassed the entire spectrum of tasks one could squeeze into its meager definition. From Korea to Guam, to Japan and the Philippines, HCU-1 detachments aided military forces of the US, South Vietnam, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. They covered every corner of Vietnam: from the harbors of Saigon to the rivers of the lower Mekong Delta; from the coastline to the upper highlands near the Cambodian and Laotian borders, from the DMZ to \\"Sea Float\\" in the southernmost tip of the country. They rescued from the murky waters of the Mekong and its tributaries practically every type of vessel utilized in Vietnam. Salvage also meant the recovery of, the repair of, and/or the demolition of aircraft and bridges; trucks, tanks, and tractors; forklifts and ferry landings; sampans and steamers. Territory Western Pacific State of Readiness: Completely mobile, continuously ready to augment Seventh Fleet forces anywhere in the Western Pacific. Administrative and Operational Control: Harbor Clearance Unit One was under the operational and administrative control of COMMANDER Service Group THREE; Vietnam detachments were under the operational control of ComNavFor-V Saigon Under CincPacFlt. History \\"Harbor Clearance Unit One, or HCU-One, was established at Subic Bay on 1 February 1966 with a hand-picked cadre of five officers and sixty- five enlisted men.\\" The original harbor clearance units were formed during World War II and were active clearing the obstructed harbors of Bizerte, Tunisia; Naples, Italy; Cherbourg, France; and Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines. As a direct descendant of those first harbor clearance units, HCU-l was commissioned at the unit's Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, home port. Twenty-four days after unit commissioning, salvage of the merchant vessel Sea Raven near Chu Lai, South Vietnam, was underway. It was a successful operation. Six months and numerous smaller operations later, the Victory ship Baton Rouge Victory was salvaged on the Long Tau River, South Vietnam. \\"The Baton Rouge Victory was the first American vessel sunk in the Saigon ship channel.\\" A large-scale operation ensued: the tender, the Subic staff, an all support personnel were called to the job site. The entire command, except for one Light Lift Craft, participated. Baton Rouge victory and its $500,000+ cargo was salvaged. The world's largest salvage patch to date, costing over $50,000, was designed/applied by the HCU-l personnel. The patch was manufactured by the Ship Repair Facility, Subic Bay Naval Shipyard, Philippines. The second major salvage operation in January/February 1967, was \\"one of the world's largest dredges . . . the 170-foot dredge Jamaica Bay\\", in Dong Tam, South Vietnam. This job was the first of three dredge jobs, all similar in size and configuration, all sunk in Dong Tam and all less than a kilometer apart. Most salvage jobs consisted of segmented operations requiring the independent operation of teams and craft deployed in-country. Major jobs were less frequent and required the mobilization of many craft, personnel, and materials. Large or small, salvage and clearance operations were the unit business: vital to the Vietnam effort. Since its inception, HCU-1 conducted these salvage and clearance operations: * Eleven large stranded ships refloated * Four large sunken ships refloated * Six large sunken ships obstructing channels demolished or removed * Twenty-nine barges refloated * Four barges demolished to clear channels * Six tug boats refloated * Three tug boats demolished to clear channels * Wreckage of twenty-two aircraft salvaged * Fifty-one Swift, PBR, and Riverine boats salvaged or saved from sinking * Twelve demolished bridges cleared from rivers * Five sunken dredges salvaged * Two sunken dredges, obstructing channels, demolished * Two tanks, four amphibious tractors, and eight Army trucks salvaged * Eight sunken mooring buoys raised and repaired * Five concrete pontoon ferry landings refloated * Two mobile support bases utilizing ammi pontoons moored in position * Two refuse trucks salved * Two forklifts salved * Six major fires fought and extinguished HCU-1 trained numerous Vietnamese divers and turned over many US Navy salvage assets to Vietnam during the Vietnamization Program. The unit was relocated to Bishop Point moorage at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (on Hickam Air Force Base) on 1 JUL 71. YRST-1 later followed the Headquarters Unit; it was towed by USS CHOWANOC (ATF-100) from Subic Bay on 7 JUL 71, bound for Pearl Harbor. YRST-1 moored at Alpha Docks on 30 JUL 71 and was then moved to Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for modification on 6 OCT 71. Modifications included the installation of a Taylor Diving System to support the Navy/Makai Range CY 71 Dive Project. Harbor Clearance Unit One (HCU-1) was renamed Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One (MDSU-1) in January, 1982. Manpower level was greatly reduced and the command was transferred as a unit under the control of Service Squadron Five at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The unit also gained six reserve detachments consisting of over 250 personnel. MDSU-1 dive teams were back in- country twenty-plus years later, farther north than any wartime operations and for a decidedly different purpose. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam allowed the US Government to research and recover remains of US service members killed in action at coastal aircraft wreck sites. In October 1995, a scuba survey team deployed to Vietnam to gather evidence. Their efforts resulted in the positive identification of one site and the elimination of several others. MDSU-1 conducted recovery operations at several sites off Nang An province in March and April, 1996. The professionalism displayed by the Harbor Clearance Unit One Salvors during the Vietnam era resulted in command awards of the Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Commendation and the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. Manpower \\"Beginning as a small cadre of personnel, HCU 1 quickly grew in size to over 260 personnel, as combat operations in littoral environment intensified. At its peak, the unit consisted of five Harbor Clearance teams of 20 to 22 personnel each and a varied armada of specialized vessels within the Vietnam combat zone.\\" Each salvage team was designed to supply experienced and qualified marine salvors anywhere they were needed: divers and non-diving technicians, artisans, and support personnel. Approximately 18 in number, teams were led by an Officer in Charge and an assistant, both diving Officers. Teams often worked in groups of three to five men on small jobs. They carried what gear they could to the job, utilizing a wide variety of transportation facilities: helicopters, cargo aircraft, small boats, ships, trucks, jeeps, and on foot. Upon arrival, they made a detailed survey to develop the salvage plan: methods to be used plus required materials and equipment. Work commenced with a minimum of three divers and whatever indigenous labor and/or materiel was available. Whenever major salvage operations were required, the teams supplied all manpower. Teams were very mobile and task-oriented. Part of a team might work deep within the Delta clearing the jungle rivers of obstructions with explosives, while others might work aboard a YLLC to reclaim a sunken PBR. Faced with responsibilities only specialized, independent duty could provide, each team member was relied upon for his contribution. Within each salvage team, it was not a matter of Navy rate, it was a matter of personal skill. The teams had a unified spirit, an esprit de corps, a bond among men --- that brought fulfilling satisfaction to the work. The teams gained extensive experience in marine salvage, deck seamanship, heavy rigging, operation and maintenance of salvage gear and equipment, and riverine warfare. All ratings were required --- from Seaman Apprentice to Chief Petty Officer, for qualified divers and non-divers. Hardware =Repair Salvage Tender (YRST)= The main unit support and headquarters barge: a towed Repair Salvage Tender --- which housed the Officer in Charge, Assistant Officer in Charge and crew of 34, including divers. Equipped with repair shops and a working platform for the fabrication of salvage patches, it also provided electrical power to wrecks. It contained the Headquarters Group, including a Naval Engineering Duty Officer (Naval Architect and Salvage Engineer), diving Medical Officer, Supply Officer, and Admin Officer, plus appropriate personnel. According to the Naval Vessel Register (NVR), the former YRST-1 (redesignated \\"YR 94 FLOATING WORKSHOP\\") still remains in service: http://www.navsource.org/archives/14/3394.htm =Heavy Lift Craft (YHLC/AHLC)= Commissioned in 1943 by Nazi Germany and contracted 14 years later by the United Nations to clear the Suez Canal of sunken vessels, ENERGIE and AUSDAUER added 4,800 tons of combined lift strength to HCU-1. YHLC-l CRILLEY (formerly ENERGIE) and YHLC-2 CRANDALL (formerly AUSDAUER) were the two largest salvage craft in the world at that time. Manned by an Officer in Charge and twenty-five men, they provided command headquarters, berthing and messing facilities for embarked personnel. The first use of the YHLCs on salvage operations was near Dong Tam, RVN, on the sunken dredger SANDPUMPER, which sank after it dredged aboard a piece of unexploded ordnance that later exploded. =Medium Lift Craft (YMLC)= Four YMLC's with tidal/ballast lift capability of 750 tons each, on lease from Great Britain, were indispensable in effecting major salvage tasks. Manned by Harbor Clearance Teams, they provided headquarters and berthing facilities for the deployed teams and craft at Vung Tau Harbor. =Light Lift Craft (YLLC)= Capable of lifting 25 tons with an A-frame derrick mounted forward and capable of a 100-ton ballast bow lift: an exceptional salvage platform with air compressors for diving operations and salvage tools. A Clyde salvage winch and a capstan, each with 7.5-ton pulling capacity, provided the muscle needed for the A-frame, the three complete sets of beach gear carried on board (60-ton pull on each leg), and the flexible power needed on independent operations. Two jetting pumps provided dewatering, underwater digging, and auxiliary fire fighting capabilities. Cutting/welding and messing/berthing facilities were also aboard. Two AC generators also provided electrical power to the salvage site and shore power to distressed ships/bases as required. Manned by an Officer in Charge and 16 enlisted men, they often operated independently and were a vital asset to a major salvage job. =Combat Salvage Boats (CSB)= Four converted Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM 6) were designed/equipped for riverine salvage work in support of the Mobile Riverine Force. A much smaller version of the YLLC, each CSB was manned by a handpicked, all enlisted crew of six to eight men, four of whom were divers. Able to perform salvage operations in lesser rivers and channels than the YLLC, the CSB was capable of entirely independent salvage operations—a mainstay of salvage support for Mobile Riverine Groups. =Diving Boats (YDB)= Two Yard Diving Boats, 64-foot highly-maneuverable craft, were a vital part of every salvage operation. Mainly used as a diving platform, they were able to go where others could not. It was manned by a crew of from four to six enlisted men (not necessarily divers) YDBs rotated between Subic Bay and Vietnam. =Advanced Diving System IV (ADS IV)= Used for both deep water search and salvage to 600 feet, it could be airlifted anywhere in the world and was maintained in Subic Bay by Harbor Clearance Team TWO.

She served primarily as an ocean convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Chebogue, Nova Scotia. During the war she was torpedoed and declared a constructive loss. Chebogue was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 19 March 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 17 August 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 22 February 1943 at Esquimalt. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on- Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After transiting to Halifax and arriving on 12 April 1944, Chebogue was sent to work up at Bermuda. Upon her return in May, she was assigned to the Mid- Ocean Escort Force escort group C-1 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. On her second return trip to Canada with a convoy she was torpedoed. =Torpedoing= On 4 October 1944 while escorting ONS 33, a convoy made up of slower ships, Chebogue was hit by a GNAT fired by . GNAT was the codename (German Naval Acoustic Torpedo) the Allies gave to the torpedo that tracked targets by the sounds they made. At the time the convoy was from the British Isles. Seven men were killed in the resulting explosion with the loss of off her stern. With part of her stern missing, Chebogue was unable to move under her own steam and had to be taken under tow. A succession of , , and the ocean tug, towed her roughly before the towline parted in a gale and Chebogue was driven ashore in Swansea Bay, Wales. She was re-floated and taken to Port Talbot where she was declared a constructive loss. Chebogue was placed in reserve at Port Talbot until December when she was towed to Newport, Wales where it was intended to make her seaworthy enough to be towed across the Atlantic Ocean. That plan was cancelled and Chebogue was instead taken to Milford Haven and paid off 25 September 1945. She was broken up in 1948. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

History KNOMAD grew out of the World Bank's earlier efforts to compile data on migration and remittances; the goal with KNOMAD was to make the process more systematic and encompass a wider range of measures related to migration. KNOMAD's inception phase was May 2011-April 2013. During this time, it held consultations with governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and academics. It organized global experts' meetings in December 2012 in Geneva and Washington D.C.. As part of the inception process, Dilip Ratha, KNOMAD's CEO, shared thoughts on KNOMAD's role in shaping future policy in a blog post for the World Bank's People Move blog. KNOMAD was announced by the World Bank on April 19, 2013. It entered a five-year implementation phase in May 2013. KNOMAD has collaborated with diverse organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Paris workshop, December 2013) and the United Nations Development Programme (specifically, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research). A number of seminars, conferences, and workshops have been held by KNOMAD in collaboration with other agencies and institutions to further its agenda. Funding The KNOMAD is funded by a multi-donor trust fund set up by the World Bank. The largest contributors are the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany). People Dilip Ratha, the CEO of KNOMAD, is also Manager of the Migration and Remittances Unit of the Migrating out of Poverty initiative of the Department for International Development in the United Kingdom as well as the host of the People Move blog of the World Bank. Research areas KNOMAD has working groups in the following twelve areas: # Data on migration and remittance flows: The focus here is on improving the availability, accessibility, and scope of data collection as well as establishing and harmonizing data and quality standards. # Skilled labor migration: The focus here is on understanding how skilled migration can best support development, and how the human capital of workers can be augmented in both sending and receiving countries. # Low-skilled labor migration: The focus here is on determining the appropriate mix of policies affecting low-skilled migration, both temporary and permanent, determining how low-skilled migration interacts with regional integration, and understanding the implications of low-skilled migration for social and economic development. # Integration issues in host communities: The focus here is on understanding what categories of migrants should be targeted by integration policies, how integration policies can best be designed to meet stakeholders' needs and values of diversity and freedom, and how integration affects development in sending countries through remittances. # Policy and institutional coherence: # Migration, security and development # Migrant rights and social aspects of migration # Demographic changes and migration # Remittances, including access to finance and capital markets # Mobilizing diaspora resources as agents of social and economic change # Environmental change and migration # Internal migration and urbanization It also identifies four cross-cutting themes for its work: The four cross-cutting themes are: # Gender # Monitoring and impact evaluation # Capacity building # Public perceptions and communications References External links * Category:Migration-related organizations based in the United States ","title":"KNOMAD"},{"id":"42347265","text":"Wrightsboro Road is a major road in the east-central part of the U.S. state of Georgia, traveling through the northwestern part of McDuffie County, the extreme northern part of Warren County, the southeastern part of Wilkes County, the southern part of Columbia County, and the northeastern part of Richmond County. It consists of two disconnected segments. The western segment, which is a north–south highway, extends from Georgia State Route 17 (SR 17) and the northern terminus of Harrison Road in Thomson to US 78/SR 10/SR 17 southeast of Washington. This is also the northern terminus of SR 80\\\\. The eastern segment, which is an east–west highway, extends from SR 223 and Hinton Wilson Road east-northeast of Thomson to James Brown Boulevard in Augusta. Even though Georgia does not sign its county highways, except for on green street signs, the western segment's McDuffie County portion is McDuffie County Route 308 (CR 308); the eastern segment's Columbia County portion is Columbia CR 571\\\\. The western segment is mostly a rural highway. In fact, some of its path is a dirt road. Except for the northern part of SR 80 between Cadley and Washington, it is an unnumbered highway. At the western end of the eastern segment, it is also fairly rural, but at its eastern end, it is an urban corridor of the Augusta metropolitan area. It connects rural areas of southwestern Columbia County with Grovetown and Augusta. It also serves as the main entry point to Augusta Mall. From its western terminus, east-northeast of Thomson, to Grovetown, it is signed as part of SR 223\\\\. In Grovetown, it is signed as part of SR 388\\\\. East of Grovetown, it is an unnumbered highway. It was named after Wrightsboro, a settlement formed in 1768 by British Royal Governor James Wright. It was a settlement for displaced Quakers from North Carolina. Later, Thomson, Dearing, and Wrightsboro were merged with parts of Warren County to form McDuffie County. Route description =Western segment= McDuffie County Wrightsboro Road begins at an intersection with SR 17 (Washington Road) in the north-central part of Thomson, in the central part of McDuffie County. This intersection is also the northern terminus of Harrison Road. It travels to the west-northwest and immediately curves to the north-northwest. It then leaves the city limits of Thomson. Just south of an intersection with the eastern terminus of Ridgeview Drive, the highway begins a curve to the north-northeast. Just north of an intersection with the western terminus of Daniel Place (CR 200), it travels over, but does not have an interchange with Interstate 20 (I-20). Immediately, Wrightsboro Road curves back to the north-northwest. North of an intersection with the western terminus of Knox Rivers Road NW (CR 20), it curves to the west- northwest. It then crosses over Mattox Creek. Just south of an intersection with the northern terminus of 3 Points Road (CR 021), the highway curves to the north. Just south of an intersection with the western terminus of Stagecoach Road, it begins to curve to the west-northwest. It crosses over Middle Creek. It then travels through Wrightsboro and then curves to the northwest. Northwest of an intersection with Ridge Road, the highway crosses over Hart Creek. It crosses over Factory Creek and then curves to the north- northwest. North of an intersection with the eastern terminus of Giles Road, it curves back to the northwest. It then intersects SR 80 on the McDuffie–Warren county line. SR 80 and Wrightsboro Road travel concurrently to the north-northeast, briefly on the county line. Almost immediately, they enter the extreme northern part of Warren County. Warren and Wilkes counties SR 80 and Wrightsboro Road slip into Warren County for just over . During this short piece, they curve to the north-northeast. Then, they briefly travel on the Warren–McDuffie county line. At a crossing of Little River Creek, they enter the southeastern part of Wilkes County. Immediately, they curve to the northwest and begin paralleling Cedar Creek. Just south of an intersection with the northern terminus of Macedonia Church Road, they curve to the north-northwest. South of an intersection with the western terminus of Big Cedar Road (CR 197), the creek ends. They curve to the north- northeast and cross over Rocky Creek. Immediately, they curve back to the north-northwest. Approximately later, they both reach their northern terminus, an intersection with US 78/SR 10/SR 17 (Thomson Road). =Eastern segment= Columbia County Harper House Wrightsboro Road resumes at an intersection with Georgia State Route 223 (SR 223) and the northern terminus of Hinton Wilson Road, east-northeast of Thomson, in Columbia County. West- northwest of this intersection, SR 223 has the local name of East White Oak Road. At this intersection, SR 223 assumes Wrightsboro Road as its local street name. They then cross over Kiokee Creek and have a slight northward jog before continuing to the southeast. Approximately later, they intersect US 221/SR 47 (Appling–Harlem Road) at a roundabout. SR 223/Wrightsboro Road then curve to a more east-southeasterly routing and cross over Little Kiokee Creek. Then, they travel just south of Euchee Creek Elementary School and Euchee Creek Library. A short distance later, the roadway crosses over the northern terminus of the Grovetown Trails at Euchee Creek and the creek itself, briefly skirting along the northwestern city limits of Grovetown in the process. A few hundred feet later, the road crosses into Grovetown proper and has an intersection with the eastern terminus of Harlem–Grovetown Road. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of SR 388, which takes on the Wrightsboro Road name, while SR 223 continues to the southeast, known as East Robinson Avenue. SR 388/Wrightsboro Road travel to the left and in a northeasterly direction, before curving to the east. Along the way, the roadway is lined with numerous retail businesses on both sides of the road. They also travel along the southeastern edge of Goodale Park. At an intersection with the northern terminus of Katherine Street, SR 388 splits off to the north-northeast, onto the southern end of Horizon South Parkway, while Wrightsboro Road continues to the east. It leaves the city limits just before passing by the Grovetown post office. Then, it transitions into more of a residential roadway and begins to gradually turn to the northeast. Just to the east of Bellevue Memorial Gardens, a cemetery, it curves back to the east- southeast and intersects SR 383 (Jimmie Dyess Parkway). Immediately after this intersection, the road enters Richmond County and the city limits of Augusta. Richmond County Augusta Mall sign As soon as the road travels through the SR 383 intersection, it curves to the south-southeast and immediately curves to an easterly direction. It travels north of Sue Reynolds Elementary School and then makes a gradual curve to the southeast. At the eastern terminus of Belair Road, Wrightsboro Road curves to the east-northeast and transitions into a more business-oriented roadway. It has an intersection with the southern terminus of Augusta West Parkway, which serves as a frontage road for the western side of Interstate 520 (I-520; Bobby Jones Expressway), and the northern terminus of Barton Chapel Road. After that intersection, Wrightsboro Road has an interchange with the Interstate highway itself. Immediately after this interchange are two entrance roads to Augusta Mall. An intersection with the southern terminus of Marks Church Road, which serves as a frontage road for the east side of I-520, as well as the northern terminus of Garden Spring Lane, which also leads to the mall, is next. Just after this intersection, is an intersection with Capps Road, which is the last road off Wrightsboro Road to lead to the mall. From I-520, Wrightsboro Road is lined with businesses on both sides of the highway. At the intersection with the northern terminus of North Leg Road and the southern terminus of Jackson Road, Wrightsboro Road travels just south of Copeland Elementary School. Three blocks later, it skirts along the southern edge of Augusta University's (AU) Forest Hills campus and Forest Hills Golf Club. Then, it skirts along the northern edge of the Augusta Municipal Golf Course and Daniel Field, a public use airport. Just past Daniel Field, Wrightsboro Road travels between AU's Summerville campus and the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center. The roadway skirts along the southern edge of Monte Sano Elementary School. It travels just south of Paine College. On the southwest corner of AU's main campus, Wrightsboro Road travels under, but does not have an intersection with, SR 4 (15th Street), although there is a ramp that leads to Wrightsboro Road. It then crosses over some railroad tracks of CSX and curves to the southeast, passing just to the southwest of Lucy Craft Laney High School, C. T. Walker Traditional Magnet School, and A. R. Johnson Health Science and Engineering Magnet High School. Just over later, the roadway meets its eastern terminus, at an intersection with James Brown Boulevard, just north of that road's southern terminus at Twiggs Street and Nicholas Street. =National Highway System= The only portion of Wrightsboro Road that is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense, are as follows: * From just east of SR 223's intersection with Chamblin Road, in the northwestern part of Grovetown, to the SR 4 overpass in Augusta. History In the fall of 2012, Reeves Construction Company of Macon was awarded a contract to widen Wrightsboro Road from two to four lanes between Jimmie Dyess Parkway and I-520. This was partially done to protect Flowing Wells Spring, a historic spring that was built to provide water to Sue Reynolds Elementary School.

The neighborhood became known as \\"Italian Harlem.\\" The Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as \\"Little Italy.\\" Many families from the town of Brusciano, Italy migrated to East Harlem bringing with their tradition of the yearly Dance of the Giglio festival in honor of Anthony of Padua.https://www.eastharlemgiglio.org/ The Giglio (\\"lily\\" in Italian) is an 80-foot-tall, three-ton statue which is carried and danced through the streets of East Harlem by over 100 members of the society.

The Festival on 106th Street grew for many years becoming one of the largest street fairs in America and remained that way until 1955. Then, in 1957, the festival moved a few blocks uptown to 108th Street, where the Dance of the Giglio continued until 1971. =21st century= After a 29-year hiatus, the Dance of the Giglio returned to East Harlem in 2000 as a Cooperative Feast with the Church of Our Lady of Mt.

Based on the results of academic research, the organization maintains that America is capable of meeting its entire energy needs through renewable energy sources, and that this goal can be achieved by the year 2050. (The organization defines renewable energy as solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy and wave/tidal power.) Furthermore, the organization claims that the solutions that will be needed to achieve this goal are primarily social and political, not technical, in nature, as most of the technology necessary to bring about the transition already exists. The organization has proposed what it calls the \\"50 States 50 Plans\\" initiative. These are plans developed for each of the 50 United States specifying the precise mix of renewable energy types that, given factors such as geography and climate, would allow that particular state to receive all of its energy from renewable sources by 2050. The organization claims that, beyond the issue of environmental sustainability, a number of significant benefits to society would come about if the initiative were adopted, including consumer energy cost savings, health cost savings and millions of long-term (40 years or more) jobs. Founders of The Solutions Project include Stanford University professor Mark Z. Jacobson, renewable energy executive Marco Krapels, documentary filmmaker and activist Josh Fox and Hollywood actor and activist Mark Ruffalo. History In June 2011, Mark Ruffalo made an appearance in Santa Monica to receive the 15th Annual Millennial award from the organization Global Green USA to honor his environmental activism — an honor he later admitted he did not believe he deserved. During the event, Ruffalo made mention of the Marcellus shale in the northeastern United States, which contains large deposits of shale gas that various energy developers in the region are either currently releasing or planning to release through the process of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking. (Ruffalo strongly opposes this practice). Banker Marco Krapels — who worked as Executive Vice President for Rabobank, a sponsor of the event, and whose full first name happens to be Marcellus — approached Ruffalo and said \\"Hi, I'm Marcellus and I'm here to help you fight Marcellus.\\" By the time the two men met, Ruffalo had already recognized that it was not effective for him as an activist merely to express opposition to fracking and other carbon-based resource extraction practices; he needed to offer a viable alternative. Later that month, Ruffalo and Krapels met in California with a group of people including filmmaker Josh Fox, the director of the widely seen anti-fracking documentary, Gasland, and environmental engineer Prof. Mark Jacobson, head of Stanford University's Atmosphere and Energy Program. Ruffalo had read a Scientific American article that Prof. Jacobson had published in 2009 that proposed, on a macro level, the feasibility of a nationwide transition to 100 percent renewable energy. Ruffalo and Fox requested that Jacobson prepare a brief document providing greater detail about how such a transition might be accomplished for their home state, New York. Fox convened a conference call between Professor Jacobson and prominent Cornell Professors Anthony Ingraffea and Robert Howarth who agreed to work on the study in the hopes that it would provide an alternative to fracking in New York state. Initially, Jacobson, referring to his busy academic schedule, promised only \\"a few paragraphs.\\" But the following day, Ruffalo found a 40-page feasibility study from Jacobson in his email. (Jacobson himself recalls the document as being 20 pages long.) Krapels in turn created a business model from this study. Jacobson also created studies for California and Washington State. A science team then employed basic calculations derived from these existing plans to create plans for the remaining 47 states. As one writer has stated, \\"By bringing together a scientific and financial perspective and giving it a cultural boost, Ruffalo’s goal with The Solutions Project is to build enough public support to make it politically palatable.\\" To that end, several of the founders have made personal appearance to help garner such support, including Prof. Jacobson in a 2013 interview on the David Letterman television show and Ruffalo in a public appearance at a NASCAR race at Chicagoland Speedway, where he cheered for a racecar with a Solutions Project advertisement written upon it, driven by environmentally-conscious racer Leilani Münter.

The Kennedy rifle works continued in operation until 1838 and the place became known as Mechanics Hill. http://www.townofrobbins.com Kennedy also established what was reputed to have been \\"the largest gun factory in this part of the south\\" in which he worked as many as seventy-five hands. According to tradition, Kennedy bought part interest in a small gun shop owned and operated by William Williamson after which they ran the concern jointly as Williamson and Kennedy. A few old guns in the section bear the initials \\"W. W. and D. K.\\" Later, Kennedy bought out sole interest in the business. Various types of guns and swords were made in this factory. The finer rifles were said to have been ornamented with silver melted from sixteen silver dollars and sold for proportionately higher prices. Large grindstones, which were operated by water power, shaped the barrels into octagonal shape and the metal was drawn out and molded by large trip hammers, also operated by water power. Finally, the task of truing the sights on the rifles was accomplished by shooting across the millpond to a target on the other side, near which stood a man to mark the deviation from the bull’s eye. The sights were then patiently varied until they were found true. Many of these guns are said to have been used in the War of 1812. So important did this business become that a post office was established there and names Mechanics Hill. There is a local legend to the effect that Kennedy, weary of paying such a high price for his gunlocks which he \\"imported\\" from a New York factory, made a trip on horseback to the latter factory, where he found that the secret method used in making the locks was carefully guarded. Undaunted, he finally wormed his way into the good graces of the workers and operators by his violin music, which they greatly admired. Once inside the shop, he soon discovered the secret involved and returned to Mechanics Hill where he began to make his own. A contemporary writer described the business in 1810: We have no manufactories unless the efforts of a couple of Riffle Makers deserve that name – these Men are Self Taught and believed to excel any Gun Smiths in the State for Neteness and Elegence of Work, The Profits of David Kennedy is worth about $15,00 [$15,000?] and that of his Brother about $1000 P. Annum. Little else is known of the sylvan operator other than the fact that he is said to have given the land and borne the expense for the construction of the old Mechanics Hill Baptist Church, the first Baptist Church in that section of Moore County. Described as \\"a substantial frame building 40 x 60 ft.\\" The building is still standing at Flint Hill between Carthage and Robbins. Inside one may still see the narrow, uncomfortable wooden seats, typical of earlier days. Planked wood railings divided the pews from each other.

Retrieved on March 13, 2017. In the 2008-2009 school year Wharton was scheduled to add the seventh grade. The eighth grade was scheduled to follow shortly afterwards. Therefore the school's name officially changed from Wharton Elementary to its current name. Imelda Alamia served as the principal for three years. In 2009 she resigned. As of 2012 the school used temporary buildings to house grades 3-8, as well as the library and technology laboratory, since the original building could not support the entire student body. As part of the 2012 HISD Bond, the school was scheduled to receive a renovation of the original building and a middle school classroom wing. In addition there were plans for updated internet capacity, additional restrooms, an art room, a larger cafeteria, a technology laboratory, a multipurpose area, a science room, and a new library. This would increase the capacity of the school facility to 750 to 900 students. The total cost was $35.6 million. As part of the move plans, in 2016 Wharton was temporarily relocated to \\"Wharton Village\\" at the Gregory- Lincoln Education Center in the Fourth Ward.\\"051616GLECLetter.pdf.\\" Gregory- Lincoln Education Center.

It was proposed due to the school's small enrollment and the district's budgetary issues. HISD had the potential of selling the school property for $8 million or higher. In October 2007 parents of Wharton students protested the proposed closure. HISD officials had argued that the Milam class had extra classrooms that could accommodate middle school students, as Wharton was scheduled to receive middle school grades. Wharton parents argued that the Milam campus was too close to railroad tracks, that the Milam campus was in a less safe neighborhood, and that the Milam campus had less room to expand. Parents were also opposed to the idea of consolidating with Gregory-Lincoln as it had inferior disciplinary and academic statistics. In addition, they argued that if a merger with Gregory-Lincoln occurred, that school would have become overcrowded. Parents in the area around Wharton created a website dedicated to saving the school and met with Saavedra to ask him to not close the school. A Houston Chronicle editorial criticized the proposal to close the school due to its high academic performance. Members of the Cherryhurst community opposed on the grounds that the closure of Wharton could imperil a baseball field on the Wharton property serving an area little league. The East Montrose Civic Association worked with the Friends of Wharton group in an effort to save the school, and all of the member organizations of the Neartown Association voted to make efforts to save Wharton. The Greater Houston Preservation Alliance attempted to get Wharton placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In April 2008 HISD stated that the school would at least remain open until the end of the 2008-2009 school year. By August 2008 Saavedra recommended that Wharton be kept open, and that month all of the HISD board members voted to keep it open. Student body In 2013 the school had about 425 students, with about 70% being classified as low income. Some students had parents who originated from Houston while others had parents who originated from foreign countries, including Mexico, China, and India. At the time there were 70 students in the Wharton middle school program. Originally the student body was mostly Anglo White. By the 2001-2002 school year about 90.5% of the approximately 400 students were Hispanic and Latino. 94% of the students qualified for free or reduced lunch. The percentages of non-Hispanic white, black, and Asian students were 5%, 3%, and 2%, respectively. The school continued to be majority Hispanic and Latino in 2008, when it had 378 students. At the time the maximum possible number of students was 397. Due to the school building's then-small size, it was at 95% capacity. Campus The campus had of space as of 2008. That year the Houston Chronicle stated that Wharton is \\"one of a handful of HISD elementary schools considered architecturally significant.\\" Architect Harry D. Payne stated that he gave the school building a Lombard Italian style.Payne, Harry D.

The building comes in a buff cast stone trim in a brown sandstone-like red color. The bricks come in many colors and are in a light buff, velour-textured style. The roof, a gray and soft brown color, is made of tiles. Wharton's sister schools are River Oaks, Briscoe, Field, Henderson, and Poe elementaries, which all share the same floor plan. Payne gave each of those schools its own unique exterior.Ewing, Betty. \\"River Oaks grads, you can relive those good old days.\\" Houston Chronicle. Monday November 29, 1976. Section 2. Page 1 (). Wharton included a SPARK Park which could be used after school by members of the community. In 2004 HISD board trustees agreed to allow a field at Wharton to be developed into a baseball field so the Neartown Little League could play there. The Conrad Hilton Foundation donated $250,000 and Maxine Meyers, the wife of a deceased automobile dealership owner, donated $5,000. The Meyers donation funded a scoreboard. The little league raised $350,000 to help pay for the facility. The baseball field was known as Eric Hilton Field. In 2016, the SPARK Park and baseball field, as well as the school's outdoor covered basketball court, were removed to make way for the construction of a new building.http://swamplot.com/gregory- lincolns-field-plowed-so-wharton-elementary-can-grow-in-fourth- ward/2016-08-31/This new building, completed in 2019, is 3 stories tall and features an indoor gym, maker spaces, and a central courtyard.https://blogs.houstonisd.org/news/2019/01/08/wharton-dual-language- academy-opens-new-campus/ Curriculum The Wharton Elementary Dual Language philosophy promotes both Spanish and English as languages of equal value. Based on second language acquisition theory and the structure of the dual language program, students must enter the program in kindergarten. Students may enter at 1st grade to be determined on a case by case basis. Since every classroom, from Kinder-5th, is a dual language classroom, English dominate students moving into the Wharton school zone after 1st grade will receive a regular English language education at the Gregory Lincoln Education Complex two blocks from Wharton. Academic performance Reflecting the bilingual structure of the school, students may take state achievement tests in either English or Spanish. In 2008 the school had the following Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) scores: In mathematics, 100% at standard and 68% commended; in reading, 94% at standard and 32% commended. By 2008 the Texas Education Agency had ranked the school as \\"Recognized\\". In 2013, Ericka Mellon of the Houston Chronicle stated that the school's percentage of students scoring at an \\"advanced\\" level in mathematics was below the average of Houston public schools, and therefore it had \\"room to improve\\". As of 2013 Children at Risk ranked the elementary school program 278 out of 775 and the middle school program 11 out of 283. In 2013 Jennifer Day, the principal, stated that the stability in the teaching staff and the school's small size contributed to the school's academic performance.

The core rulebook combines the functions of a player character (PC) manual, a game master (GM) guide, and a monster reference in one volume. With the rules as written, it makes minor changes from its original 1981 inspiration in separating race from class, using the d20 ascending armor class scheme, and dispensing with alignment.

Additional classes, additional races, conversion tools and other accessories for PCs and the GM are also available for free, allowing the game to be scaled to the desired complexity, similar to the advanced fantasy games of the 1980s, if desired.

Background Undefeated heavyweight champion George Foreman had little trouble in his two fights the previous year. First he captured the WBA and WBC heavyweight titles after dominating Joe Frazier, scoring six knockdowns in less than two rounds in an easy technical knockout victory in January 1973. Foreman would follow this by making his first defense against José Roman in Tokyo in September of that year, easily winning the bout by first-round knockout. For his second defense, Foreman was matched up against Ken Norton for a March 1974 bout held in Caracas, the capital and largest city in Venezuela. Norton was coming off two successive fights against Muhammad Ali in 1973, winning the first fight in March by split decision (famously breaking Ali's jaw in the process), and then narrowly losing the second by another split decision in September. Norton's impressive performances against Ali made him one of the top heavyweight contenders for Foreman's titles, but the future hall-of-famer was installed as a 3–1 underdog against the hard-hitting champion and given little chance of obtaining a victory. A week before the fight had happened, promoter Don King, banking on a victory by Foreman, had already inked a deal that would see Foreman make his next defense against Ali in the \\"Rumble in the Jungle.\\" When George was King: Foreman vs Norton 29 year anniversary, Secondsout.com article, Retrieved on 2014-03-29 A 3 to 1 underdog, Norton was back in a familiar position, promised less money than Foreman ($200,000 to the $500,000 George was guaranteed), and deemed a solid underdog to the hard-slugging Texan. If Caracas seems like a strange destination to hold a heavyweight boxing event, there was a practical reason it was sought out as the host: an agreement had been reached stipulating all taxes would be waived. Don King produced the initial guarantee, a $10million letter of credit from Carl Lombardo, a 34‐year‐old Cleveland construction millionaire. King earlier had persuaded Lombardo to put up $400,000 for the Foreman‐Norton bout here. The Fight The fight would last less than two rounds with Foreman scoring his third consecutive knockout victory to retain the heavyweight titles. The two fighters fought an even first round, but Foreman quickly gained an upper hand in the second and sent Norton to canvas three times in the round. Foreman stunned Norton about a minute into the round and followed it up with a combination that sent Norton down into the ropes for the first knockdown. Norton was able to continue the fight, but Foreman continued his attack and quickly sent Norton back down with a left hand to the head. Norton would again get back up and continue but was once again attacked by Foreman who put Norton flat on his back with another combination. Norton would get back up, but the referee decided to call the fight and Foreman was awarded with the victory at exactly two minutes of the second round. Aftermath There was considerable controversy after the fight as both fighters ran into unexpected trouble with the Venezuelan government. The fight had been made in Venezuela on the basis that all taxes would be waived. However, a day after the fight, the government reneged the offer and insisted that they collect 18% of the fighter's purses, which was $700,000 for Foreman and $200,000 for Norton.

The land upon which the house was built, at the northwest corner of Elizabeth and John Streets, had belonged to William Wragg and passed to his heirs after Wragg died in 1796. The property was subsequently acquired in part by Gabriel Manigault. It is possible that Manigault, an amateur but successful architect known for his Adamesque designs, had a hand in designing the building before dying in 1809.

After being a member of the Republican Party for twenty years, in 2012 he switched to the Democratic Party. Ferrell previously served ten years on the Federal Way City Council and was the prime mover behind the city's transition from a Council–Manager form of city government to a Mayor-Council or \\"Strong Mayor\\" government. Federal Way is currently the 9th largest city in the state of Washington.  Personal background  Jim Ferrell grew up in Federal Way until the age of nine when his father died. After his father's passing, he, his mother, his twin brother and his older brother and sister moved to Yelm, Washington. Jim Ferrell graduated from Yelm High School in 1985 as a multi-sport athlete and student body president. After high school, Ferrell attended the University of Washington and walked on, as an outside linebacker, to the Washington Huskies football team, then led by Hall of Fame head coach Don James. Ferrell spent four seasons (1985–88) on the team, receiving the 1986 Brian Stapp Memorial Award for the most inspirational non-letterman, earning the 1988 Bob Jarvis Award for most inspirational walk-on player, and was chosen by his fellow players in 1988 to win the prestigious Guy Flaherty Medal for the team's most inspirational player, despite being primarily a scout team player for all four seasons. After graduating in 1989 from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in political science, Ferrell attended the Gonzaga University School of Law and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.) in 1993. Jim Ferrell lives in Federal Way with his wife, Wendy, and their son.  Professional background  While in law school, Ferrell was a White House intern during the presidency of George H. W. Bush and worked as a legislative assistant for State Senators Pete von Reichbauer and Ray Schow; both of whom represented Washington's 30th legislative district, which includes the entirety of Federal Way. During this period, Jim Ferrell was nearly appointed to the Washington State Senate, finishing second behind Schow to fill the seat left vacant after von Reichbauer's election to the King County Council. After receiving his J.D., Ferrell began his career as a prosecutor for the City of Renton, Washington before moving onto the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office in 1998. That same year Ferrell won an award from the King County Sheriff's Office for performing life-saving CPR on a fellow prosecutor and, in 2003, won an award for chasing down on foot and apprehending a defendant who had fled a courtroom. In 2000, Ferrell became the supervisor of King County's newly created domestic violence court and later (2005–07) served two terms as the president of the King County Prosecuting Attorneys Union. Similar to his near appointment to the State Senate, Ferrell in 2007 finished second behind Dan Satterberg to be appointed as King County Prosecuting Attorney to fill the position following the death of Norm Maleng. Jim Ferrell had risen to the position of King County Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney before resigning on December 31, 2013 to take the position of mayor of Federal Way.  Political career  In 2002, Jim Ferrell challenged the 30th Legislative District's (then) two-term incumbent socially conservative Democratic Washington State Representative Mark Miloscia.Like Ferrell, Miloscia would later change parties, he to Republican in 2014. Miloscia ended up winning the election by more than 11 percentage points. The following year, Ferrell took on incumbent Federal Way City Councilmember Mary Gates, who had been a city councilmember since Federal Way was incorporated in 1990. Ultimately, Ferrell defeated Gates by nearly 5 percentage points. In his two subsequent city council reelection races in 2007 and 2011, Ferrell did not face any opposition. One of Ferrell's prime initiatives while on the city council was a successful transition to making Federal Way Municipal Court judges elected, instead of appointed. Analogous to this interest in having public accountability for officials, Jim Ferrell supported the February 2008 ballot initiative to transition from a Council–Manager form of city government to a Mayor-Council or \\"Strong Mayor\\" government. The initiative failed by about 10 percentage points. The following year, Ferrell spearheaded a second effort to make the same transition in city government. This initiative, on its second attempt, passed by about 3 percentage points on the 2009 General Election ballot. During the campaign to change the city's form of government, Ferrell made clear that he would run for the office of mayor if the initiative proved successful. Later, State Representative Skip Priest, City Councilmember Mike Park, and City Councilmember (and future State Representative) Linda Kochmar also joined the race to become the city's first elected mayor. His campaign focused on opposition to the proposed skyscraper development in the city's downtown, skepticism of the proposed performing arts center, and a focus on public safety. In the primary election, Ferrell and Priest finished as the top-two vote-getters meaning they would face-off in the general election. Ultimately, Skip Priest won the general election by about 4 percentage points. The proposed skyscraper plan, which was a major talking point during the campaign, died three months after the election when the developers could not pay an initial $100,000 to the city on the proposed $350 million project. In April 2012, five months following Ferrell's election to a third term to the Federal City Council, he announced that he would be switching parties; from the Republican party to the Democratic party. In his column explaining his decision, Ferrell said it was motivated by what he saw as a move by the Republican party to more far-right tone and reactionary policies. Chief among his concerns were that the Republican party appeared to him to take neither global climate change nor a 21st-century approach to energy policy seriously. Also concerning Ferrell was what he saw as the Republican party's continued preference toward tax cuts for the rich instead of policies to mitigate the jobs lost and lives upended following the Great Recession of 2008. On May 6, 2013, Jim Ferrell announced his candidacy for Federal Way's mayor in the 2013 election, in what turned out to be a rematch of the 2010 contest between himself and (then) Mayor Skip Priest. In addition to similar themes heard during the 2010 election, Ferrell was also critical of Priest's cuts in the city's workforce, particularly its police force, during his term in office, as well as his advocacy for legislation that would have dismantled Sound Transit. Public safety was of particular interest during the election due to the 2013 mass shooting at Federal Way's Pinewood Village apartment complex that left five dead, in addition to a 24% increase in burglaries and a 12% increase in auto thefts in the city in 2012. The rematch of the 2010 election resulted in the unseating of the incumbent mayor with Ferrell prevailing with more than 55% of the vote. =Mayor of Federal Way= Jim Ferrell took office as Federal Way's second elected mayor on January 1, 2014.

Soimaud makes a conscious effort to portray these communities, stating, “Your eyes are your first steps towards education; therefore your work should exude energy, strength and love.\\" His work has been featured in several solo exhibitions, from Florida to his native France. Soimaud's Studio is located in the heart of Little Haiti in Miami, Florida. Soimaud's work expands recognition of the various African Diaspora communities throughout the world. Biography From a young age, Soimaud was exposed to creativity. His father, Jean-Pierre Soimaud, was a Parisian designer who owned a boutique called O'Kennedy on the Champs-Élysées and his stepmother, Catherine Alain Bernard, former Editor-in- Chief of French Elle Magazine and Depeche Mode Magazine. Spending much time in the studio, Soimaud learned the fashion business, but more importantly he watched fashion luminaries at work, which inspired his own creative process later on in his art career. After graduating from Lycee Racine in Paris, Soimaud apprenticed at the Ecole Superieure d'Architecture de la Ville de Paris as well as the Academie de la Grand Chaumiere in 1982, where he fine- tuned his abilities before leaving school in order to travel. While journeying throughout Asia, Africa, and South America, Soimaud went out of his way to integrate amongst the people in order to better understand them. Visiting Colombia in 1986, during the height of Pablo Escobar's power, Soimaud ignored warnings of danger in order to paint people of lower socio-economic status, causing some to applaud his love of South America. Art Soimaud's career spans 25 years; the main mediums for his work include charcoal drawing, oil painting, and photography. Largely self-taught, Soimaud cites influences from Impressionism, Les Nabis, Abstract Expressionism, and Dada. A top Miami art critic, Elisa Turner, said about his work, “With a rare gift for evoking the soul of street life at the fringe of fabulous wealth, his [Soimaud's] art documents the grit and groan of tough neighborhoods.” Soimaud's work draws inspiration from the settings he places himself into, be they a small village in South America, or the ugly truths of urban life; his work speaks honestly to the experiences of those he meets. “His broad life experiences are reflective in his work, which mostly focuses on life in the downtrodden communities of the African Diasporas around the world.” His latest projects focus on chronicling the underbelly of Miami, as well as featuring aspects of Haitian culture, including symbolism linked to Vodou ceremonies and the large Haitian community in Miami. Besides his large-scale works, Soimaud has done book covers for a number of publishers, including Temple University Press and L'Harmattan. In 2012, Soimaud's artistic work on the Haitian Diaspora received recognition from University of Florida and Duke University in the forms of grants (where his works are housed in their Digital collections), as well as from the John and James L. Knight Foundation as a 2009 Knight Art Challenge Finalist. During the Art Basel 2013 show in Miami, Blouin ArtInfo called his exhibition, Genesis, a “must see”.

Burns, executive officer of the board, Feb. 1943 The Combined Munitions Assignments Board was a major government agency for the U.S. and Britain in World War II. With Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's top advisor in charge, it took control of the allocation of war supplies and Lend lease aid to the Allies, especially Britain and the Soviet Union.Roll, (2012) pp 176-79 Churchill's original plan called for two offices for the Board, one in London which he controlled, and one in Washington under Harry Hopkins. The US Army strongly protested, and insisted that the board be under the control of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the body that brought together the top American and British military commanders. General George C. Marshall, US Army Chief of Staff, argued that the distribution of munitions was so essential to military strategy, that it could never be left to civilians. His argument won out. Hopkins became the head of the Board, but he always saw his role as subordinate to the Combined Chiefs.Robert E. Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins: An Intimate History (1948) pp 471-73 Canada asked for a seat on the Board; it was refused but was given a seat on other, much less powerful combined boards.

In order that these committees may be fully apprised of the policy of their respective Governments, the President will nominate a civil chairman, who will preside over the committee in Washington, and the Prime Minister will make a similar nomination in respect of the committee in London. In each case the committee will be assisted by a secretariat capable of surveying every branch and keeping in touch with the work of every sub-committee as may be necessary.

The film was a naval melodrama, an attempt by Blasetti to make a more commercial film following the difficulties encountered with the propagandist The Old Guard (1934).Moliterno p.41 Plot After a couple of projects had either been postponed or fallen through for Blasetti, it was suggested that he should make a film about the navy in peacetime. The result is this strange film, which at the outset plays like a propaganda piece for the might of the Italian navy, only to veer off into high melodrama, as it zeroes in on Commander Corrado Valeri (Gino Cervi), and his conflict between duty and the jealousy of his wife. There are comedic asides, a visit to a North African club, affording Blasetti to contribute the first scenes of nudity in Italian film, and there are moments of heroics, including a mission to rescue the doomed crew of a wrecked submarine. As if all of that was not more than enough, the film features a star-studded cast including Evi Maltagliati, Gianfranco Giachetti, Doris Duranti, Elisa Cegani (in her debut), and even a brief cameo by Blasetti himself.

He graduated with a B.S. from Cornell University and a MD-PhD from the University of Virginia where he studied under future Nobel Laureate, Alfred G. Gilman. He then worked at New York Hospital where he trained to become a neurologist and also served as a junior faculty member. Career Noticing that the biotechnology company Genentech was conducting state-of-the- art research but not on diseases of the nervous system, he determined to get into the biotechnology business. After rebuking Gilman's efforts to recruit him as an academic, he found a sponsor in George Sing, a venture capitalist at Merrill Lynch, and obtained $1 million in seed capital. He also recruited George Yancopoulos, a 28-year-old scientist, to be his partner, and in 1988 they founded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. After several years of trying to recruit research doctors many of whom preferred to work in academia or for large corporations, they developed their first drug to treat Lou Gehrig’s disease. It was a failure as was their second drug to treat obesity. Thereafter, they invited the former Merck & Co. CEO Roy Vagelos to be the chairman of their company and to help to turn the company around. He implemented two strategic changes; only invest in drugs in which the biology of the disorder is fully understood; and do not underestimate the importance of human testing to ensure that what works in the laboratory will also work in the real world. =Eylea= As CEO of Regeneron, Schleifer oversaw the \\"approval and growth of high-priced drugs.\\" In 2011, Regeneron's first successful drug was Eylea for age-related macular degeneration.

Sanofi, in order to get out of its commitment, paid Regeneron $50 million and ceded the rights back to Regeneron. The drug was a blockbuster generating $838 million in its first full year and sales increased 55% to $1.3 billion in 2013 making Schleifer a billionaire. In 2014 Eylea grossed $1.735 billion. As CEO Schleifer received a total compensation of $41,965,424 in 2014.

Titled \\"My Gangster Lover\\" in Korean, the film is about a recent college graduate from a rural town who's having trouble finding a job in Seoul, so she moves into a cheap basement apartment, which happens to be next door to a middle-aged, third-rate gangster. Critics called My Dear Desperado a \\"likeably offbeat\\" character-driven romance and \\"one of the discoveries of Korean cinema in 2010,\\" praising it for Kim's \\"enjoyably unaffected\\" direction and \\"fluid handling\\" of his own script, the strong acting and chemistry between its two leads, the smooth transition from comedy to pathos, and a casual realism of setting and style that's evocative of ordinary, real people (despite fitting within the conventions of a romantic comedy). With minimal marketing and no major stars, the film struggled to attract attention upon its theatrical release. But it gradually built up positive word of mouth, and managed to sell close to a modest 700,000 tickets, enough to ensure the filmmakers a healthy profit (it was produced by Yoon Je- kyoon). Kim won Best New Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards, and received New Director and Screenplay nominations from the Grand Bell Awards and Korean Film Awards. Kim would later make a cameo appearance in Park's first film as a director, Top Star (2013). =Tabloid Truth= In 2014, Kim directed Tabloid Truth, starring Kim Kang-woo, Jung Jin-young, Ko Chang-seok and Park Sung- woong. The crime thriller begins with the apparent suicide of a promising actress due to false, malicious rumors, and as her manager risks his life by seeking the truth behind them, he uncovers a vast conspiracy of power, money and sex, where faceless people from every field of society, such as financial firms, public relations agencies, and government organizations, are authors of jjirasi (from the Japanese word chirashi, meaning \\"leaflet\\"). Jjirasi are secretive online newsletters that navigate the sketchy underbellies of politics, business and showbiz, read voraciously by stock investors and tabloid journalists who pay for them; fact and fiction are selectively picked, processed and published to shape public opinion and further particular agendas. Fascinated by the subject of jjirasi -- what it is, how it came about, and who circulates it -- Kim chased sources, but doing his research was difficult because the \\"rumor makers behind the scenes\\" refused to reveal their identities. He eventually found a \\"distributor\\" and an \\"information collector\\" who were willing to be interviewed, and coupled with an in-depth look into timely scandals such as the suicides of Jang Ja-yeon and Choi Jin-sil, Kim used the information to make the movie more realistic despite the backdrop of fictional events. Reviews praised Kim for the slow-building intensity in his directorial approach, his \\"deft\\" rendering of fight and chase scenes, and for \\"convincingly dramatizing\\" the ruthless competition between jjirasi writers and the destructive nature of their information. But some critics also pointed out the limitations of Tabloid Truth as merely a predictable action thriller, though Kim said he intended to make an \\"entertaining film rather than a serious one with social commentary.\\" Filmography *The Great Battle (2018) - director *Tabloid Truth (2014) - director, script editor *Top Star (2013) - cameo as DP *The Suicide Forecast (2011) - cameo as dead body 2 *My Dear Desperado (2010) - director, screenplay *Off Road (2007) - screenplay *Oasis (2002) - 1st assistant director *Last Statement (2002) - screenplay *Inner Circle (1999) - screenplay *3PM Paradise Bath House (1997) - script editor *The Flying Monster (1984) - special effects crew member Television *The Return of Iljimae (MBC, 2009) - screenplay *Snail (SBS, 1997) - screenplay Awards *2010 31st Blue Dragon Film Awards: Best New Director (My Dear Desperado) References External links Category:South Korean directors Category:South Korean screenwriters Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kim Kwang-sik"},{"id":"42347774","text":"Arthur William Kornhauser (November 23, 1896 - December 11, 1990) was an American industrial psychologist. He was an early researcher on topics such as labor unions and worker attitudes, and advocated a form of industrial psychology that approached problems from the workers' standpoint rather than that of management. He has been described as one of the most important early figures in organizational psychology, and is particularly remembered for his focus on worker well-being. His work was interdisciplinary, crossing the boundaries between industrial psychology and sociology and political science. Early life and education Kornhauser was born in Steubenville, Ohio on November 23, 1896. He studied psychology and biology at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with a BS in 1917. Subsequently, during World War I, he worked with Walter Dill Scott to develop psychological and trade tests for the US Army. Kornhauser obtained an MA from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1919, and worked as a research assistant at Scott's \\"Scott Company\\" from 1919 to 1920. His early research worked focused on the practical application of psychological testing to the needs of business. He completed his formal education with a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Chicago in 1926. His dissertation was titled \\"A Statistical Study of Some Methods Used in Judging College Students\\". Kornhauser began teaching business psychology at the University of Chicago in 1921, first as an instructor and later as an associate professor. He married his first wife, Beatrice Levy, in 1923. They had two children, William (1925), who became a renowned political sociologist, and Ruth (1927). Career Kornhauser taught at the University of Chicago from 1921 to 1946. From 1922 to 1930, he was the most-published author in the Journal of Personnel Research, with 9 articles to his name. His research during this period focused on psychological testing. He served as a research fellow of the Social Science Research Council from 1928 to 1929, and was president of the business division of the American Association of Applied Psychology (which later became the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) from 1941 to 1943. In addition to his teaching and research work, Kornhauser served as a consultant for numerous companies. During this period, Chicago was a major center of early industrial psychology, which was beginning to emerge as a distinct discipline. Feeling slighted by the lack of attention and resources given to his work, Kornhauser left the U of C in 1943. After a brief research position at Columbia University, he move to Wayne State University, taking a joint appointment with the Department of Psychology and the Institute of Industrial and Labor Relations, which began to offer doctorates in 1955. Kornhauser's research covered a broad range of topics. He worked to develop the opinion polling techniques of David Houser into rigorous scientific techniques. He pioneered the union-friendly application of industrial psychology, which up to then had been entirely used in the service of management. Later in his career, he focused on workers' mental health. His 1965 work Mental Health of the Industrial Worker put forth the spillover hypothesis, which traces the cause of problems in home and leisure life to problems at work. Ross Stagner, who chaired the Wayne State psychology department at the time, stated that his own administrative support for Kornhauser's writing of the book was \\"one of my significant contributions to the field.\\" Kornhauser retired from Wayne State in 1962. He died on December 11, 1990, of a stroke resulting from Parkinson's disease, at his home in a retirement community in Santa Barbara, California.

History 1908 Los Angeles Times Advertisement for original Pig 'n Whistle in Downtown Los Angeles The Pig 'n Whistle was originally a chain of restaurants and candy shops, founded by John Gage in 1908. He opened his first location in Downtown Los Angeles, next to the now- demolished third city hall in the 200 block of South Broadway. The Hollywood location of the Pig 'n Whistle was first opened in 1927 next to The Egyptian Theatre. The building housing the new restaurant cost $225,000 and featured \\"[c]arved oak rafters, imported tiles, artistically wrought grilles and balcony and great panelled fresco paintings from Don Quixote.\\" It was frequented by such celebrities as Spencer Tracy, Shirley Temple and Howard Hughes. The original Hollywood location closed down after World War II and its distinctive wooden furniture, decorated with hand-carved whistle-playing pigs, was sold to Miceli's Italian Restaurant, located around the corner at 1646 Las Palmas Avenue, where it remains to the present day. By the late 1990s the location housed a fast-food pizza restaurant, and all that remained of the original tenant was a bas-relief pig on the front of the building. In 1999, British restaurant operator Chris Breed remodeled the building, recovering the spectacular original ceiling ornamentation, and re-opened the restaurant. The restaurant name originates from two Old English words, piggin, a lead mug, and wassail, a wine drunk during yuletide. In Popular Culture *1974 - In Chinatown J.J.

The purpose is to provide a wide variety of financial support which are excluded in Comprehensive Social Security Assistance for the poor in order to ease the confrontational sentiments and reduce the hatred emotions towards the rich people. It was suggested by Donald Tsang Yum-kuen, who was the Chief Executive of Hong Kong from 2005-2012, in the 2011 Policy address of Hong Kong. The Finance Committee Finance Committee Procedure discussed about contributing five billions to the Community Care Fund on 13 May 2011 and it was passed with twenty seven votes agreeing, six votes disagreeing and twelve votes abstaining. The Fund started in the second half year of 2011 and the fund is managed by Steering Committee Steering Committee press release of the Community Care Fund. Steering Committee of the Community Care Fund The chairperson of the Steering Committee is the Administrative Secretary. The committee members include twenty members who are from different areas like business, community welfare, education, medical treatment, political, labours and regional and four members from the government. They are responsible for supervising and the overall planning of the fund. The Executive committee under the steering committee is responsible for giving suggestions according to the target needy groups, funding amounts, arrangements of fund-raising and other financial and administrative issues. Four subcommittees (Education, Home affairs, Medical and Welfare) are responsible for the implementation of new projects. Assistance programmes =School-based Fund for Cross Boundary Learning Activities Education Bureau = It aimed to subsidize students from low-income families to participate in cross-boundary learning activities, which enable them to widen their horizons and gain special learning experiences. The target participants are Primary 1 to Secondary 7 students studying in Hong Kong, they should be full or half granted by the Student Financial Assistance Agency (SFAA). Covering Period: July 2011 to June 2014 =Community Care Fund Medical Assistance Programme Hospital Authority= It provides subsidies for patients with financial difficulties to pay medical bills. The targeted recipients are cancer patients. To fit the eligibility criteria, the patient must be eligible within the meaning of the latest relevant government gazette published under the HA Ordinance. Indication and commencement of treatment must be supported by a designated HA doctor as stipulated under the prevailing clinical guidelines. Moreover, an applicant must pass a household-based financial assessment conducted by the Medical Social Workers (MSWs). Covering Period: August 2011 (First Phase), January 2012 – August 2012 (Second Phase) =School Lunch Subsidy School Lunch Subsidy = Primary students from needy families can get lunch subsidies. The target students are primary one to primary six students who receive full grant under the Student Financial Assistance Scheme and study in whole-day government- aided and Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) primary schools (including special schools). Covering Period: 2011-2012 academic year =Special Care Subsidy for the Severely Disabled Social Welfare Department= The programme aims at providing severely disabled persons who are requiring constant attendance, living in the community and not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance with a special care subsidy for assisting them to purchase care goods, services or for other purposes related to nursing care. Covering Period: October 2011 - Now More assistance programmes can refer to the official website. Controversy =One-off measure= The fund has been criticized for its ineffectiveness in alleviating poverty as most of the subsidies are one-off payments, such as the One-off Living Subsidy for Low- income Households Not Living in Public Housing and Not Receiving CSSA. People who are out of the safety net asked the measures under the CCF to be regular.Boost to Community Care Fund no real relief, says struggling mum, South China Morning Post, 28 February 2013 Responding to these voices, the Hong Kong government has regularized some measures since September 2013, including Financial Assistance for Non-school-attending Ethnic Minorities and New Arrivals from the Mainland for Taking Language Examinations, Medical Assistance Programme (Second Phase) and Subsidy for Non-school-attending Ethnic Minorities and New Arrivals from the Mainland Participating in Language Courses.Community Care Fund Also, in the 2014 Policy Address, the government has announced that seven programmes under the fund will be regularized progressively starting from April 2014. =School-based Fund (Cross-boundary Learning Activities)= The initial motive of this subsidy is to provide opportunities for students with financial needs to participate in cross- boundary learning trips. Eligible students can get a $3000 subsidy. However, people commented that subsidies for buying textbooks, stationeries or other learning tools would be more appropriate. Cross-boundary learning trips are not a must in their learning process. People also complained that this programme would benefit travel agencies. After the announcement of the programme, learning trips which cost $2999 were promoted.商界無興趣捐關愛基金 , Sing Pao, 01 June 2013 =Lack of support from the business sector= The initial proposed funding of the CCF was from both the government and the business sector with each contributing HK$5 billion, but the business sector has shown little support in donations. Carrie Lam, the Chief Secretary for Administration at the time, said the government will no longer actively reach out to businesses for donations, as she “personally” prefers to encourage the private sector to engage in all forms of poverty alleviation activities, instead of just making contributions.Community Care Fund receives HK$15b boost , China Daily Hong Kong Edition, 22 June 2013 As of 31 December 2013, injections from the Government reached $20 billion, whereas the donations pledged and received was only $1.8 billion and $1.468 billion respectively. The imbalance proved its initial attempt to help the poor by receiving assistance from the business sector is unsuccessful. =Lack of transparency= Usual regular measures for alleviating poverty are to be approved by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong before implementation, but the measures proposed under the CCF are not. Concerns over the transparency of budgets and planning of measures hence were aroused. It was worried that proposals without prior consent of the public could not be carried out smoothly, which would result in a misuse of public funds. In response to this, Carrie Lam, the Chief Secretary for Administration at the time, assured lawmakers that LegCo will always be consulted beforehand if a CCF program costs more than HK$100 million. A biannual report will also allow LegCo to assess the work of the CCF.Community Care Fund receives HK$15b boost , China Daily Hong Kong Edition, 22 June 2013 References Category:Welfare in Hong Kong ","title":"Community Care Fund"},{"id":"42347800","text":"Irdomyrmex breviantennis is an extinct species of ant which belongs to the genus Iridomyrmex.

He wrote and directed the horror-romantic comedy Spellbound (2011) and the crime thriller Monster (2014). Career =As screenwriter= Hwang In-ho first wrote the screenplay of Sisily 2km (also known as To Catch a Virgin Ghost), a 2004 film that combined horror and black comedy elements in a story about gangsters (played by Im Chang-jung and Kwon Oh-joong) who steal a diamond and escape to a small town, . His next screenplay, Love Phobia (titled \\"Lizard\\" in Korean) was a 2006 melodrama that starred Cho Seung-woo and Kang Hye-jung as a couple who meet each other only thrice in the 20 years spanning their childhood to adulthood. His third screenplay, Two Faces of My Girlfriend (2007) was a romantic comedy about a 30-year-old male virgin and loser who falls for a woman with DID (played by Bong Tae-gyu and Jung Ryeo-won). Hwang also served as script editor on high school comedy The Legend of Seven Cutter (also known as Escaping from Charisma, 2006) starring Yoon Eun-hye, and the World War II blockbuster My Way (2011) starring Jang Dong-gun. =Spellbound= In 2011, Hwang made his feature directorial debut with Spellbound (titled \\"Chilling Romance\\" in Korean), about a stage magician (Lee Min-ki) who meets an introverted woman (Son Ye-jin) who is constantly haunted by ghosts. Like Sisily 2km, Hwang again flouted genre conventions by combining romantic comedy with horror. He said he had felt uncomfortable within the limitations of Korean commercial cinema, and wanted his \\"story to flow free of genre restrictions,\\" adding, \\"Why do you have to respect every genre rule? My story still makes sense anyway, with or without them. [...] I just added a ghost to a simple love story, which resulted in a romance with a totally different texture than other romance films.\\" Spellbound became a hit with more than 3 million admissions, making it the 7th top-grossing Korean film of 2011 and one of the most commercially successful Korean rom-coms in recent years. =Monster= For his sophomore directorial effort, Hwang reunited with actor Lee Min-ki on Monster (2014), this time opposite Kim Go-eun. Kim played a developmentally disabled woman who wreaks revenge on the serial killer (Lee) who murdered her beloved younger sister. Hwang experimented further with his filmmaking by pushing genres to the extremes, combining thriller, comedy and fantasy. But he primarily presented the film as \\"a character drama,\\" saying he made \\"an effort to express the emotions, alienation and loneliness the main characters were experiencing. It was their emotions rather than the situations I wanted to explore. [...] What counts for me are characters. What interests me is the fresh tone created by a new type of character when he or she is introduced to a different cinematic world.\\" Critical and audience response were mostly negative, criticizing the unsuccessful genre mashup and a perceived misogyny beneath the film's ostensible message of female empowerment.

In contrast to the more radical and left-wing bodies advocating for indigenous sovereignty at the time, OPAL was for most of its existence overtly assimilationist, advocating for the integration of Aboriginal Australians into mainstream white culture. Its main focus was on welfare and housing and as it received monies from the Queensland government for its programs, the work of OPAL had both equal parts support and criticism for not being independent and operated by non-Indigenous organisers. History OPAL was founded by white Australians including Joyce Wilding and Muriel Langford in 1961 in order to facilitate the integration of Aboriginal people in Queensland into a single \\"multicultural\\" society. Conservative in outlook from the start, it declined to affiliate itself with the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI), with which it had significant ideological differences. It also had a long standing rivalry with the Queensland Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (QCAATSI), which it saw as subversive and communist. Senate Neville Bonner, the first Indigenous Australian elected to parliament, was president of OPAL from 1968 to 1974.  Housing Program  In 1962, OPAL purchased a hostel in Melbourne Street, South Brisbane to provide short term accommodation for homeless Indigenous families, who had moved to Brisbane. It was also a meeting place for Indigenous people. This hostel closed in 1985.

The organization advocates for the passage of socially conservative policies in the state. It also produces voter guides to encourage its supporters to elect conservative lawmakers. Over 100 bills supported by CAP have been signed into law in Arizona. CAP employees co-wrote Arizona's controversial SB 1062, which would have shielded business owners and employees from lawsuits if they refused service to anyone based on what they described as sincerely held religious beliefs. In particular, the bill would have exempted such businesses if they refused to hire or service people because of the person's sexual orientation based on religious beliefs. The bill was vetoed by governor Jan Brewer. History Cathi Herrod The Center for Arizona Policy was founded by Len Munsil in 1995; he served as Founding President and General Counsel until 2005. The current President is Cathi Herrod, who joined the organization as legal counsel in 1997. CAP receives some of its funding from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, an organization largely funded with money from the Hobby Lobby craft store company. In 2011 the Foundation awarded $236,250 of the $1.6 million CAP received in grant revenue that year. Legislation CAP has supported and lobbied for over 100 bills that have been signed into law in Arizona. In 2012, 13 CAP-supported bills passed, including a law banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. = Abortion = The Center for Arizona Policy opposes legal abortion and has supported legislation to restrict access to abortion. CAP helped to write a bill in Arizona to require that women to explain to their medical providers why they are seeking to have an abortion. Lawsuits against anti-abortion laws have cost Arizona taxpayers more than $2 million, but CAP president, Cathi Herrod, stated that the anti-abortion policies \\"outweigh the losses in court.\\" = Civil Union Ordinances = In 2013, the City of Bisbee announced that it intended to legalize same-sex civil unions within the municipality. The Arizona Attorney General, Tom Horne, initially opposed the ordinance, but withdrew a legal challenge after the city adopted an amended version of the ordinance that complied with state laws. The Center for Arizona Policy opposed the city's move to offer civil unions and responded with a challenge saying, \\"If the City of Bisbee enacts a law recognizing a quasi-marital relationship not provided for by Arizona law, it will likely find itself involved in expensive and time-consuming litigation, which it is likely to lose.\\" Following Bisbee, the cities and towns of Clarkdale, Cottonwood, Jerome, Sedona, and Tucson also approved of civil unions. CAP describes acceptance of homosexuality in society as \\"a deceitful and angry ideology\\" and supports what it describes as a \\"biblical value that God has a specific intent for sexuality and that it is only realized in the relationship between one man and one woman within the confines of marriage.\\" =SB 1062= The Center for Arizona Policy, along with the Alliance Defending Freedom, helped write Arizona Senate Bill 1062, a controversial bill that, if signed into law, would have allowed business owners and employees to refuse to serve anyone based on sincerely held religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill claimed it was meant to protect the religious freedoms of Arizonans, while opponents pointed out that it was intended to allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Top aides for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer worked closely with CAP in crafting the language of the bill, but Brewer, in response to boycott threats and other economic pressure from various national groups,http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/26/politics/arizona-brewer-bill/index.html vetoed it on February 26, 2014, a few days after it passed the state Senate and House. CAP and its president Cathi Herrod received a great deal of media attention during the debate over the bill, with several stories highlighting the amount of influence the organization has in Arizona politics.

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region but has spread to other parts of the world. It is a free-swimming epipelagic species found near the surface of the water. It was first described as Oithona oculata by the Irish zoologist George Philip Farran in 1913. Description Free-living copepods have translucent bodies divided into a broad head, a thorax bearing swimming legs and a narrow, limbless abdomen. They have a major articulated joint between the front and rear portions where the body flexes ventrally. Male Dioithona oculata are long, with females being slightly larger at . A distinguishing feature for this species is the structure of the lens of the eye. Distribution and habitat Dioithona oculata is native to the Indo- Pacific region but has expanded its range into the Atlantic. Its range includes Madagascar, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, lagoons in the Laccadives, Rodrigues, the Nicobar Islands, Christmas Island, the Strait of Malacca, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, the Caroline Islands, the Palau Islands, the Great Barrier Reef, New Caledonia, the Samoa Islands, northern Chile and California. The Atlantic range includes the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, Belize, the Caribbean, Jamaica and the Gulf of Mexico. It can form swarms, dense aggregations of individuals, and these have been observed in shallow water over sandy bottoms, above patches of algae in reef areas and over algae on rocky shores. They also form swarms in sunlit patches of water among mangrove roots at the edge of lagoons in the Caribbean where they have reached densities of 90 copepods per ml (0.034 fl oz). Behaviour The swarming behaviour of these copepods has been studied among red mangroves in Belize. It was found that swarms only formed by day, with the individuals dispersing at night. Swarms were denser in June than in January and consisted of adults and late-stage larvae. In nearby open water younger larvae predominated during the day and swarming did not take place. In a current of up to , the swarm maintains its position, usually in a position where a beam of sunlight penetrates the canopy. There is an energy cost in maintaining the swarm in a particular location and each individual faces greater competition for food which makes the adaptive value of this behaviour unclear. Swarming may provide greater breeding opportunities, reduce the chance of involuntary dispersal by the current and protect against predation. In fact, there are few planktivorous fish feeding on this copepod among the mangroves and the main predator is the medusa of the tiny box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora.

Various clubs and societies function under the aegis of the university and it has various notable academicians, literary figures, politicians, jurists, lawyers, sportsperson, among others as its alumni.  History  Bab-e-Syed, entrance to the university = Funding = The university was established as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan,\\"Aligarh\\" in Chambers's Encyclopædia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 267. starting functioning on 24 May 1875. The movement associated with Syed Ahmad Khan and the college came to be known as the Aligarh Movement, which pushed to realise the need for establishing a modern education system for the Indian Muslim populace. He considered competence in English and Western sciences necessary skills for maintaining Muslims' political influence. Khan's vision for the college was based on his visit to Oxford University and Cambridge University, and he wanted to establish an education system similar to the British model. A committee was formed by the name of foundation of Muslim College and asked people to fund generously. Then Viceroy and Governor General of India, Thomas Baring gave a donation of 10,000 while the Lt. Governor of the North Western Provinces contributed 1,000, and by March 1874 funds for the college stood at 1,53,92 and 8 anas Maharao Raja Mahamdar Singh Mahamder Bahadur of Patiala contributed 58,000 while Raja Shambhu Narayan of Benaras donated 60. Donations also came in from the Maharaja of Vizianagaram as well. The college was initially affiliated to he University of Calcutta for the matriculate examination but became an affiliate of Allahabad University in 1885. The 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, HEH Mir Osman Ali Khan made a remarkable donation of Rupees 5 Lakh to this institution in the year 1918. = Establishment as university = Masjid at the Aligarh Muslim University Circa 1900, Muslim University Association was formed to spearhead efforts to transform the college into a university. The Government of India informed the association that a sum of rupees thirty lakhs should be collected to establish the university. Therefore, a Muslim University Foundation Committee was started and it collected the necessary funds. The contributions were made by Muslims as well as non-Muslims. Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan and Aga Khan III had helped in realising the idea by collecting funds for building the Aligarh Muslim University. With the MAO College as a nucleus, the Aligarh Muslim University was then established by the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920. In 1927, the Ahmadi School for the Visually Challenged, Aligarh Muslim University was established and in the following year, a medical school was attached to the university. The college of unani medicine, Ajmal Khan Tibbya College was established in 1927 with the Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College Hospital being established later in 1932. The Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College And Hospital was established later in 1962 as a part of the university. In 1935, the Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology was also established as a constituent of the university. Before 1939, faculty members and students supported an all-India nationalist movement but after 1939, political sentiment shifted towards support for a Muslim separatist movement. Students and faculty members supported Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the university came to be a center of the Pakistan Movement.Mushirul Hasan, \\"Nationalist and Separatist Trends in Aligarh, 1915–47,\\" Indian Economic and Social History Review, (January 1985) 22#1 pp 1–33 =Women's education= Dr. Sheikh Abdullah (\\"Papa Mian\\") is the founder of the women's college of Aligarh Muslim University and had pressed for women's education, writing articles while also publishing a monthly women's magazine, Khatoon. To start the college for women, he had led a delegation to the Lt. Governor of the United Provinces while also writing a proposal to Sultan Jahan, Begum of Bhopal. Begum Jahan had allocated a grant of 100 per month for the education of women. On 19 October 1906, he successfully started a school for girls with five students and one teacher at a rented property in Aligarh. The foundation stone for the girls' hostel was laid by him and his wife, Waheed Jahan Begum (\\"Ala Bi\\") after struggles on 7 November 1911. Later, a high school was established in 1921, gaining the status of an intermediate college in 1922, finally becoming a constituent of the Aligarh Muslim University as an undergraduate college in 1937. Later, Dr. Abdullah's daughters also served as principals of the women's college. One of his daughters was Mumtaz Jahan Haider, during whose tenure as principal, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad had visited the university and offered a grant of 9,00,000. She was involved in the establishment of the Women's College, organised various extracurricular events, and reasserted the importance of education for Muslim women. In 2014, then vice-chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah turned down a demand by female students to be allowed to use the Maulana Azad Library, which was males-only. Shah stated that the issue was not one of discipline, but of space as if girls were allowed in the library there would be \\"four times more boys\\", putting a strain on the library's capacity.

Although there was a separate library for the university's Women's College, it was not as well- stocked as the Maulana Azad Library Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Smriti Irani decried Shah's defence as \\"an insult to daughters\\". Responding to a petition filed by Human Rights Law Network, the Allahabad High Court ruled in November 2014 that the university's ban on female students from using the library was unconstitutional, and that accommodations must be made to facilitate student's use regardless of gender.India court library ban on women 'unconstitutional' . BBC News Online, 14 November 2014. The Court gave the university time until 24 November 2014 to comply. = Minority institution status = Aligarh Muslim University is considered to be institution of national importance, under the seventh schedule of the Constitution of India. In 1967, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court had held that the university is not a minority educational institution protected under the Indian constitution; the verdict had been given in case to which the university was not a party. In 1981, an amendment was made to the Aligarh Muslim University Act, following which in 2006 the Allahabad High Court struck down the provision of the act which accorded the university minority educational institution status. In April 2016, the Indian government stated that it would not appeal against the decision. In February 2019, the issue was referred by the Supreme Court of India to a constitution bench of seven judges.  Organisation  The university's formal head is the chancellor, though this is a titular figure, and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university.

Established as The Bulletin, then The Bull, BULL was the union's only high-gloss magazine and was published monthly by an editorially independent student team.University of Sydney Union's BULL Magazine , Retrieved 21 March 2013. Written by students, for students, editorial leadership changed annually and as a result, editions changed tone and style over the years.

BULL had a strong focus on feature articles, culture and arts and involved fellow student reporters, contributors and photographers enriching the magazine. In 2015 the readership of the magazine dropped dramatically which eventually led to the closure of BULL that year. In early 2016, it was officially reported that BULL would be discontinued with print versions and the website shutting down, and a new online platform, later titled Pulp, would take its place, edited by student journalists Whitney Duan and Aparna Balakumar. History Originally published daily as The Bulletin, then The Bull, the Union Recorder was the main monthly student publication at the University of Sydney prior to BULL. However, due to rationalisation in the face of voluntary student unionism, it was announced that in 2006, BULL would be the primary repository of student content and feature student editors. Since 2006, BULL has been wholly staffed and operated by University of Sydney students, with eight editions published a year. In 2013 BULL was awarded at the ACUMA Awards for Excellence in Campus Service, receiving Best Publication, among other awards given to the University of Sydney Union at the ceremony. In March 2014, Honi Soit reported that a proposal was made to the University of Sydney Union student-appointed board of directors to take BULL exclusively online. While the decision was unanimous among the editors, the current Board, who have power over the Union's operations, struck down the proposal, leaving the publication in print. BULL faced a review as a result.Honi Soit: The Manning Files , Retrieved 21 March 2013. Rather the editors of this year pursued with establishing a BULL online platform and radio program that was later discontinued. 2015 saw the magazine readership decline severely and lead to a reduction in circulation. Content Content of BULL was all written by students of any degree and contributors were encouraged to write throughout the year. In 2014, BULL began a collective of reporters from applicants to be regular writers for the publication, which continued through to 2015. The topics explored in BULL varied year to year in line with the priorities and beliefs of the editors. Each edition contained an editorial, feature articles, interviews, travel and cultural articles and reviews. Student photography and comics were often printed by the magazine, but did not appear in every issue. BULL had no political alignment and is distanced from the agenda of student representatives, though many editors later went on to run for election as editors of Honi Soit as part of the Students' Representative Council. =Features= As a cultural magazine, BULL had explored current and cutting edge topics over the years. Some feature articles concepts had included dying on social media, disabled sex, being gay in Canberra, the art of \\"picking up\\", slash fiction, eating competitions, Asian blepharoplasty, over-the-counter medicine addiction, the Pink Panthers, sex over 60, firestarters, Shakespeare and Company, cat obsessions, stuttering and the rise of King Hits in Australia. The front cover of Issue 5 in 2013 was particularly controversial for depicting a cartoon penis dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan, for the accompanying article \\"Getting Racy\\", by Flora Grant and Lawrence Muskitta, on sexual racism. =Interviews= BULL had interviewed a number of notable Australian and international people. This has included Anna Funder, Jasper Knight and Andrew Hansen. Closure In early 2016, it was announced that BULL would be discontinued and replaced with a new online platform. In February, it was announced that this platform would be titled Pulp and would have two editors paying student contributors for their articles on the website, rather than unpaid contributions as had occurred in the past and occurs with newspaper Honi Soit. Likewise students were to be paid salaries in the place of bursaries that had become commonplace in student positions across the university campus. The new editors for Pulp in 2016 were announced as Whitney Duan and Aparna Balakumar, with the latter later replaced with Swetha Das.

Excavation of the wreck and its well-preserved artifacts has revealed details of the construction of this British-made vessel, and of life aboard ship and of the cargo carried. These details have been augmented by considerable documentary material such as the ship's manifest and cargo list. The excavation of the ship was concluded in 1981. The ship's construction and configuration has been presented using contemporary records from 1774 and 1776 and examination of the lower part of the ship's hull in situ. According to the records of the time, it was a ship of some 470 tons. The craft was about 121 feet (documents of March 1764) or 127.5 feet (archaeological measurement) long. The oak frame was held together with both iron and wooden nails.

Among these were Mexican ceramics such as miniature shoes, animals and musical instruments as well as Guadalajara ware. The ship also carried various dye stuffs, including leather bags containing more than 10,000 pounds of cochineal. Archaeologists recovered some of these dye containers. In addition to silver coins, cacao and vanilla beans were valuable items in the cargo that were salvaged right after the storm. Exotic lading included two kimonos that were also rescued by the Spanish. Although all the silver coins listed on the manifest were recovered immediately after the storm, no silver or gold ingots were listed as being on board or as having been recovered; however, archaeologists recovered some gold and over eighty pounds of silver ingots. It is concluded that these unmarked pieces were contraband not originally recovered because they were not very accessible and the owners did not want to make a fuss over them lest the government salvage officials find out they had been smuggling strenuously controlled goods. In addition, items used by the crew were recovered by the archaeologists in the late twentieth century. These include porcelain, glassware, olive jars, grindstones, and the remains of bones from various animals. All recovered artifacts are in the possession of the state government.

Originally formed in 1916 for overseas service during World War I, the battalion fought in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium between late 1916 and 1918, before disbanding at the conclusion of hostilities. During the inter-war years, the 44th became part of the part-time Citizens Force, based in Western Australia. During World War II, it undertook garrison duties in Australia but was not deployed overseas to fight. In the post-World War II period the 44th was amalgamated with the 11th Battalion, before being subsumed into the Royal Western Australia Regiment in 1960. History =World War I= Raised at Claremont, Western Australia, in February 1916, the battalion formed part of the 11th Brigade, which was part of the 3rd Division, which was formed as part of an expansion of the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) that took place at the end of the failed Gallipoli Campaign. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel William Mansbridge. After a period of training in Australia, in June 1916 the 44th, with an authorised strength of 1,023 men, embarked on the transport Suevic, and was transported to the United Kingdom where the 3rd Division underwent a further period of training on Salisbury Plain before crossing the English Channel to France in November 1916, where they joined the other four infantry divisions of the AIF. The following month, the battalion entered the front line for the first time. Throughout the winter of 1916-17, the battalion rotated between manning the front line, and conducting training or manual labour in the rear areas. Their first taste of combat on the Western Front came on 13 March 1917, when half the battalion was committed to a major raid, which ultimately proved unsuccessful. For the next two years, the 44th Battalion fought in the trenches along the Western Front, taking part in a number of significant battles, the first of which came around Messines in early June 1917. The battalion received in a new commanding officer in August, when Lieutenant Colonel James Clark took over from Mansbridge; he would subsequently command the battalion until the end of the war. In late October 1917, the battalion fought around Broodseinde Ridge, where it suffered heavily - out of 992 men committed, only 158 finished the battle uninjured. After wintering in Belgium, in early 1918, the 44th was moved south to the Somme Valley after the Germans launched their Spring Offensive, during which it undertook defensive operations in front of the vital railhead of Amiens, including repelling a German attack around Morlancourt. After the German offensive was blunted, a lull period followed during which the Allies slowly sought to gain the initiative, undertaking several \\"Peaceful Penetration\\" operations. In July, the 44th took part in the Battle of Hamel, assigned the task of flanking the village to the north and south in support of the 43rd Battalion. In August, the 44th joined the Allied Hundred Days Offensive after which it took part in several attacks against the Hindenburg Line in the final months of the war. Its final battle came in early October 1918, at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal. By the time it was withdrawn for rest, it was down to just 80 men and it did not return to the line before the war came to an end in November 1918; total casualties during the war amounted to 437 killed and 1,346 wounded. A total of nine drafts of reinforcements were sent to the battalion between June 1916 and July 1917. The 44th Battalion received 15 battle honours for its involvement in the fighting on the Western Front; these were bestowed in 1927. =Inter-war years and World War II= Following the end of the war, the 44th Battalion was eventually disbanded as part of the demobilisation of the AIF. In 1921, Australia's part-time military force was reorganised to perpetuate the numerical designations and divisional structure of the AIF, and as a result the 44th Battalion was re-raised at this time, based in Western Australia, drawing personnel from the 16th, 28th and 51st Infantry Regiments. Through its link with these units, the battalion inherited the theatre honour \\"South Africa 1899-1902\\". During the inter-war years, the battalion formed part of the 13th Brigade, which was headquartered in Perth, and was part of the 5th Military District. Despite the widespread Defence cutbacks that occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, the battalion remained in existence throughout the Great Depression, even when other units were amalgamated as manpower became scarce. In 1927, when territorial titles were introduced, the battalion adopted the title of the \\"West Australian Rifles\\"; it also formed an alliance with the Essex Regiment and In Hoc Signo Vinces was adopted as the battalion's motto. The majority of the battalion was based in Perth during this time, but a single company was raised at Bunbury. At the outbreak of World War II, the provisions of the Defence Act initially precluded Militia units from being sent overseas to fight. As a result, the 44th Battalion remained in Australia to undertake garrison duty, and even though it was later gazetted as an AIF unit after the majority of its personnel volunteered to do so, it was never deployed overseas. In early 1942, the 44th Battalion was detached from the 13th Brigade and assigned to the Special Mobile Force that was formed to respond in the event of a Japanese raid against installations in Western Australia. In June 1944, the battalion was disbanded, though, as the Japanese threat had passed and the Australian military sought to redress an manpower shortage in other areas. After the war, the battalion was not re- raised in its own right, although it was formed as an amalgamated unit known as the \\"11th/44th Battalion (The City of Perth Regiment)\\". This unit remained in existence until 1960, when a reorganisation of the Citizens Military Force led to the creation of six multi-battalion state-based regiments, and the 11th/44th became subsumed into the Royal Western Australia Regiment. Battle honours The 44th Battalion was awarded the following battle honours: * South Africa 1899-1902 (inherited from predecessor units); * First World War: Messines, 1917; Ypres, 1917; Polygon Wood; Broodseinde; Poelcappelle; Passchendaele; Somme, 1918; Ancre, 1918; Hamel; Amiens; Albert, 1918; Mont St. Quentin; Hindenburg Line; St. Quentin Canal; and France and Flanders, 1916-18.

Early Structures Four structures have served as the home of Perry County's courts and administration since Perry County's creation. The first structure was a temporary home for the court, while the latter three structures were constructed solely to house the county courts and administration. The first structure was a two-story log building which served as the site of the county court after the creation of Perry County in 1821, and housed the court until a courthouse building could be built in 1826. The first building solely built to serve as the county courthouse was constructed in 1826 at a cost of $1,486.25. No known photos exist of this building. The first courthouse building of 1826 was replaced in 1861 with a new two-story stone building at a cost of $8,000. The second courthouse building constructed in 1861, however, had eventually fallen into disrepair and was replaced with the third and present brick courthouse in 1903 at a cost of $31,819.Perryvillemo.com: Attractions History 2nd Perry County Courthouse, 1861-1903 In the early days before statehood, court sessions took place in private homes or the parish houses. By 1821, the population of the Barrens and surrounding area warranted the separation of the southeastern portion of Ste. Genevieve County into a new county, Perry County. After Perry County was organized in 1821, the county court was established on May 21, 1821 in the home of Bede Moore, located two and half miles north of Perryville, by Lewis Cissell, D.L. Caldwell, and Samuel Anderson. County officials used a two-story log building for conducting county business. At first, there was a delay in building a court house as the population of Perry County had also been obliged to help fund the courthouse in Ste. Genevieve County, as they had been a part of that county. Commissioners were appointed to locate a seat of justice somewhere in the county, but no move was made toward the erection of a courthouse until 1825.State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html Because of its centrality, population, and location on the historic road between Ste. Genevieve and Cape Girardeau, the area just east of the Barrens was chosen to be the seat of Perry County. Bernard Layton donated fifty-one acres of his land one-half miles east of St. Mary's Seminary for the site of a county-seat town, Perryville. 3rd Perry County Courthouse, 1909 In 1825, it was decided that a more permanent building was needed to house the county court and administration, so a contract was let for the first courthouse. Funding of the $1,486.25 (1825 dollars) project came from the sale of 55 lots of property deeded to the county by Bernard Layton. No known illustrations of the structure exist. By 1859, a growing county created a need for more space. The court appropriated $8,000 (1859 dollars) for construction and appointed John E. Layton as superintendent of the construction. The two-story building was completed in 1861. The site of the building was on the northeast corner of the square. The building continued in use until after the turn of the century. Grand jury reports from that time indicated the condition of the building was beyond repair. After county residents presented a petition calling for an election on September 1, 1903, voters approved a proposition for a $30,000 bond issue to finance a new courthouse. From several plans submitted in November, the court selected the proposal of Caldwell and Drake, Columbus, Indiana, who were then contracted for construction. Construction began in February, 1904. The cornerstone ceremonies were conducted on June 4, 1904. The total cost on the red brick, 65-by-92-foot building was $31,819. The county continues to use the courthouse for county court and administration purposes.Extensions.missouri.edu http://extension.missouri.edu/p/UED6078 (includes 19 photographs from 2015) The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.
