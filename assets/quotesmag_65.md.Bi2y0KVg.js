He ruled the area around modern Bijapur in the early 6th century, and was the grandfather of the dynasty's first sovereign ruler, Pulakeshin I.  Reign  Jayasimha finds a mention in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions of his dynasty, but no inscription issued by him has been discovered so far. A 543 CE (Shaka 465) inscription dated to the reign of his grandson Pulakeshin I has been discovered at Badami. Assuming a reign of around 20 years each for Jayasimha and his son Ranaraga, historian Durga Prasad Dikshit dates Jayasimha's reign to c. 500-520 CE. He was succeeded by his son Ranaraga, who appears to have stabilized the Chalukya rule in the region. The Mahakuta inscription eulogizes Jayasimha as \\"the very receptacle of brilliance, energy, valour, memory, intellect, splendour, polity and refinement.\\" It compares him to the deity Maghavan (Indra) in terms of good qualities, and to the deity Vaishravana (Kubera) in terms of wealth.  Political status  The Mahakuta inscription gives Jayasimha's title as nṛpaḥ (\\"king\\"). The Chalukya records also accord him various epithets, such as Vallabha, Shri-vallabha, and Vallabhendra. The absence of any imperial titles in this list indicates that Jayasimha was a vassal king. According to one theory, Jayasimha was a vassal of the Kadambas. The Chalukya inscriptions and coins are somewhat similar in style to those of the Kadambas, who preceded them in the Deccan region. According to the Daulatabad inscription of Jagadekamalla, Jayasimha was \\"the destroyer of the pomp of the Kadambas\\". This suggests that Jayasimha was originally a Kadamba vassal, but this cannot be said with certainty. For example, it is possible that Jayasimha was actually a vassal of the early Rashtrakutas of Manapura, and repulsed a Kadamba attack a Rashtrakuta feudatory. Another possibility is that Jayasimha assumed sovereignty after the defeat of his Rashtrakuta overlords by the Nalas and the Mauryas of Konkana, and then repulsed a Kadamba invasion. Another theory is that Jayasimha was a vassal of the early Rashtrakutas of Manapura (not to be confused with the later imperial Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta). According to the records of the later Chalukyas of Kalyani, who claimed descent from the Chalukyas of Vatapi, the Chalukya family's progenitor Jayasimha defeated the Rashtrakutas (like the 10th century Kalyani Chalukya ruler Tailapa II, who defeated the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta). These records include the Kauthem inscription and the court poet Ranna's Gadayuddha. The Kauthem inscription names the defeated king as Indra, the son of Krishna; no such early Rashtrakuta king is known from the extant historical records. An inscription of the early Rashtrakuta king Abhimanyu records the grant of the Undikavatika village to the Shaivite ascetic Jatabhara in the presence of Jayasimha, the commander of the Harivatsa fort. This commander may be same as the Chalukya ruler Jayasimha. Historian D. C. Sircar theorized that the Rashtrakutas of Manapura were overthrown by the Nalas and the Konkana Mauryas, who, in turn, were overthrown by the Chalukyas.

Jayasimha seems to have carved out a principality around modern Bijapur after the decline of his overlords, and Ranaraga appears to have spent his reign stabilizing the Chalukya power in the area. Like his father, Ranaraga finds a mention in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions of the Vatapi Chalukyas.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as \\"At Risk, Declining\\" by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy D. griseata was first described and illustrated by George Vernon Hudson in 1898. Hudson further discussed and illustrated the species both in his 1928 and 1939 publications. The lectotype specimen is held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Description Hudson gave a description and illustration of the larvae of this species in his 1939 publication. In appearance the larvae are extremely variable but it is able to mimic the appearance of a twig on its host plant. The pupa are enclosed in a cocoon made of moss and plant detritus and can be found on the ground. Hudson described the adult moth as follows: Distribution D. griseata is endemic to New Zealand. This species range is from the Bay of Plenty/Taupo to Southland. However it is likely locally extinct in some North Island localities. D. griseata has been recorded as being collected in Wellington, Top house at Lake Rotoiti, Mount Hutt, Castle Hill, Cave Creek in Paparoa National Park, Arthurs Pass, Waiho Gorge in Westland, Dunedin, Ben Lomond, Lake Wakatipu, Takitimu Mountains in Southland, Invercargill and Orepuki.  Biology and behaviour  The larvae of D. griseata are present in December and January. The adult moths emerge from February. This species can be found on the wing from September until May and is attracted to light. Adults rest on mossy tree trunks in the vicinity of their host plants. Host species The host species of this moth are leafy mistletoes, including Peraxilla colensoi. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being \\"At Risk, Declining\\". It was regarded by Hudson as being a scarce species even when first described. The survival of this moth is dependent on the survival of its host plants.

Reed (November 7, 1910 – February 1, 2003) was an American biologist and geneticist who coined the term genetic counseling and advocated for the wider use of genetic counseling as a means to educate the public.  Education  Reed was born in Vermont on November 7, 1910. He acquired a bachelor's degree in biology from Dartmouth College where he worked under George Davis Snell researching harelip in mice. He published a paper on this subject in his junior year. He later attended Harvard University for graduate school where he performed research under William Castle, studying mutations in mammals including harelip. He published 9 more research papers at Harvard before receiving his phd in biology in 1935.  Career  Reed performed research in labs at the University of Chicago, McGill University where he studied development in mice, and Harvard University, where he studied the relationship between fruit fly genetics and behavior. In 1942 Reed participated in WWII by using his background to assist in statistical research as well as interrogation of German scientists. In 1947, Reed began working at the University of Minnesota as the director of the Dight Institute for Human Genetics. While working at the Dight Institute, Reed coined the term “genetic counseling” as a way to describe advice he and his colleagues were giving to physicians in relation to genetic diseases such as Huntington disease, mental retardation, and cleft palate. In particular, he used this terminology to distance his work from terminology such as genetic hygiene, which he viewed as being overly associated with cleanliness products like toothpaste. In his writings on genetic counseling, Reed strongly emphasized the importance of respect for his clients, and his approach to counseling has since been regarded as being similar to that of psychologists. In 1956, Reed became president of the American Society of Human Genetics. That same year, he would release Counseling in Modern Genetics, a book designed to present the concept of genetics and advice related to genetics in a manner that the typical family could comprehend In 1956, Reed attended the first International Congress of Human Genetics, where he introduced and promoted the idea of genetic counseling. Though Reed never acquired a formal medical degree, he personally participated in over 4000 cases of genetic counseling. Reed retired from academic studies in 1978 and died on February 1, 2003 at the age of 93.  Personal life  Reed Married Elizabeth Wagner Beasley in 1946 after her husband, an acquaintance of Reed, died in WWII. He would have two more children in addition to the child that Beasly had by her first marriage. Beasly, an associate professor of biology herself, would frequently assist Reed with his research. Reed enjoyed breeding violets and orchids during his retirement and also spent helped Hmong immigrants learn English and other skills necessary to succeed in America.

She was a pioneer of the Tobacco Protest, which banned the use of tobacco, and instrumental in the protests that opened Tabriz temporary warehouses during the Bread Famine.  Life  Zainab was born to a country style family in one of the old Tabriz villages named, Amuzin Al-Din. Her father, Sheikh Sulayman, was a poor peasant who, like other villagers, had a hard time subsisting during that era.عبدالحسین ناهیدی آذر، 1360، (Women in Constitutional Revolution)، page 41. Zainab was a strong and sturdy woman. Although at that time in Tabriz, most of the women clad their faces, Zainab did not. Before the Constitutional Revolution and during the autocracy, there was no security in Iran so government officials bought wheat during the summer at reduced prices and kept the wheat in warehouses. In the winter, government officials sold the wheat to the poor at high prices which created an artificial famine. During the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah 1934, the artificial famine reached its peak, and the poor people of the city had great difficulty. This harsh environment caused Zainab Pasha along with other women to revolt. Zainab and her revolutionaries closed markets and attacked government headquarters. They also attacked and destroyed some expensive gourmet groceries and large bakeries. =Influences= For almost a century and for the first time in Iran's history, Zainab along with forty women of Tabriz that were against the oppressors, and in parallel with the sexual inequalities imposed by the feudal system and traditional views on women, started an armed struggle and fought bravely. One of the important factors of the Tabriz Women's Movement led by Zainab was the overwhelming tyranny of some princes and rulers of the Qajar period in Azerbaijan.سه مبارز مشروطه، 13847 Three Constitutionalist Fighters، page 133. In the social and political arena of this period, there were also important problems such as the \\"Bread Crisis\\" and \\"Tobacco Score\\", which were also among the most important factors that led the Women's Movement of Tabriz. One of the biggest social and economic problems of the Qajar era was also bread shortage and the expensive price of bread. So, this led the women's uprising and dealing with this dilemma.(Shagh Newspaper )، مرداد ۱۳۸۴ ، (یادنامه شرق Constitutional Revolution special)، page 11. =Tobacco Protest= Zainab Pasha’s reputation was actually known after the Tobacco Protest. When Naser al-Din Shah Qajar gave the tobaccos to the British, the people of Azerbaijan wanted to prevent this cycle from proceeding forward. During those days, Hajji Mirza Javad, a well-known political cleric, sent his disciples to the market and invited the people to close their stores. The people obeyed his request and did what he had asked for. It didn’t pass too long as the government intimidated the people and defeated them. So this brought some dozen brave women under the leadership and command of Zainab Pasha to fight and get the market back to the people. These women were known to defeat and destroy any corruption that took place at that time in Iran, and nobody knew their identities. طاهرزاده بهزاد، 1363، page 84 Finally, because of the intense opposition of the people, Nasir al-Din Shah was forced to cancel the tobacco credits that was given to Britain. But the non-stop struggle of Zainab Pasha along with the other women continued. It was also said that Zainab along with her women combatants appeared in many streets and places encouraging the people especially the men to fight against oppression. She once said to the men that if you don’t dare and are afraid to fight the thieves and looters that are stealing your wealth and honor of your homeland, then take the women's veil and sit in the house. Don’t talk about men and bravery! Then she threw her scarf towards them, and disappeared from the sight of the amazed audience. Women in Constitutional Revolution، 1360، page 43. =Bread crisis in Tabriz= In the Qajar period, bread was one of the most important and most critical economic problems of the people. It was said that during this period there were many protests due to the lack of bread. Famine and drought were the main reasons of bread shortage. This was done by the government as they bought wheat from the villagers in a low price and stored them in warehouses until the end of winter. Then when people needed flour, they sold the wheats to them in a very high price. Most of the time, people had to wait in long queues, in front of the bakeries, just to buy a piece of bread which was also very expensive. Women often took the lead in protesting the critical situation of bread. An example of this operation, was Zainab Pasha and her followers. The operation took place in the late Nasir al-Din Shah's famine that was caused by the persecution of wheat. Women decided to demonstrate. So, approximately 3,000 women came to the market, and forced the marketers to close their shops and join the rally. The government informed Gheshoon Maragheh and ordered the troops to shoot. About five women and a seyyed were killed. In this rally, some great clerks also joined the women. They sat in the Russian consulate and prevented three volunteers from leaving the scene, and treated them with violence. On the next day of the rally, three women and some were killed and wounded. This led the slogans in the rally to become political against the Qajar monarchy and made the government to retreat once again. گزارش‌های «هرگون» از تبریز، اوت ۱۸۹۵، اسناد وزارت امور خارجه فرانسه، جلد ۴۲. به نقل از «کتاب جمعه، سال اول، ۲۲ اسفند ۱۳۵۸، صص ۵۴–۵۳». =Confiscation of Deputy Mirza Abdul Rahim’s warehouse= Another important operation of Zainab Pasha and her followers was the confiscation of Mirza Abdul Rahim’s warehouse who was the deputy ambassador of Azerbaijan. He was in charge of bringing famine and bread shortage. So the women could no longer tolerate the condition they were in. They said that if the men won’t do anything such as fighting, then we will do this as ourselves. So, Zainab ordered her women combatants to prepare for an attack to the market and due to the fears of the marketers, they all closed their stores and stepped aside. Their rally started to protest towards the deputy’s house. The deputy was full of fears and ordered his troops to shoot at the demonstrators. The rally turned into a bloody massacre. As the prince of that time, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah heard the news, he announced that many have been killed, and they weren’t afraid of the bullets and or being killed. The prince sent a message to the people to keep their patience and by tomorrow he will make the prices fair again. But, Zainab did not listen to these words and told the crowd not to surrender and show that they are on their requests. =Attack on Nezam Al- Alma’s warehouse= It was said that Nezam Al-Alama had the Shah’s permission to sell his wheats whenever he wants to. So, Zainab decides to attack his warehouse. After identifying the location of the warehouse, she prepared the attack plan. عبدالحسین ناهیدی آذر، ۱۳۸۴، ص ۱۴۸. In order to attack, she makes a flag with her own veil and uses it as a sign for her troops to outbreak. Once they seized the warehouse, she divided all the wheats in it between the hungry people.جهان زن (مجله)، دوره جدید، سال اول، شماره ۳، دهم آبان ۱۳۵۸، ص ۱۳ Legacy The last thing known about Zainab Pasha’s life and destiny comes back when she along with a caravan goes to Karbala for pilgrimage. Even though, she was considered an elderly woman at that time, but never lost her fighting spirit.بایا (ماهنامه)، سال اول، شماره ۱ و ۲ فروردین و اردیبهشت ۱۳۷۸ (زینب پاشا: نماد مبارزه مردم آذربایجان علیه ظلم، ص ۹۶». Zainab who had gone to Karbala with some people, stayed in Khaneghain. Some Ottoman soldiers who had come to investigate them before reaching Karbala, were hardened by Zainab who was angry with their behaviors. She also encouraged the people around there to rebuke the soldiers and attacked them. Then she continued her path and went to Karbala.جهان زنان (مجله) دوره جدید، سال اول، شماره ۳ دهم آبان ۱۳۵۸، ص ۱۳. According to sources, after this event, no further news was heard about Zainab Pasha. It seems that Zainab had died during her last visit, and her body was never transferred to Tabriz and her birthplace, Amuzin Al-Din, and was buried in Karbala. =Poetry= Mirza Farrokh, was a poet, who himself witnessed Zainab's struggles and wrote many Turkish poems about her so that the people of Tabriz could understand. He was the first poet to write about Zainab and always pointed out to the bravery and heroism of Zainab during her attacks. زینب پاشا =Men's Rise= Zainab Pasha gave strong and heavy speeches on the streets to call on men for uprising. An example of her speech to the men: “If you do not dare to fight oppression, and if you are afraid to fight with the thieves and looters who are stealing your wealth, honor, and, homeland, then sit in the corridor of your house. We will fight against the wrongdoers instead of you”. Her movements and speeches braved the men and made them to rise up.زینب پاشا؛ قهرمان جنبش تنباکو در تبریز See also * Tobacco Protest * Women in Constitutional Revolution * Persian Constitutional Revolution * Women's rights movement in Iran * Women's rights in Iran  References  External links * رضا زاد عموزین الدینی، مجید، ۱۳۸۸، زینب پاشا ، انتشارات اختر، تبریز * Iranian Tobacco Company official site * / tabrizinfo.com/عصيان « زينب پاشا» عيار آذربايجان * /bbc.comزنانی که تاریخ ایران را تغییر دادند Category:People from Tabriz Category:Iran–United Kingdom relations Category:Qajar dynasty Category:Civil disobedience ","title":"Zainab Pasha"},{"id":"57372186","text":"The Photographer is a 1974 American thriller film written and directed by William Byron Hillman.

Raudberget was born in Stadsbygd and as an adult has lived in Oslo, Asker, and Drammen. From 1951 to 1954, Raudberget attended the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art. From 1953 to 1954 he also studied stone cutting at Nidaros Cathedral. From 1954 to 1957, Raudberget studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts under Per Palle Storm, where he also took fresco classes from 1957 to 1958, and he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1959. Raudberget's works are displayed at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design and other institutions, and are also included in many public and private collections. Raudberget debuted as a sculptor in 1955 with his work Guttehode (Boy's Head) in fired clay. His early work, such as his portrait of Nils Kærup Bjørneboe, shows good characterization and a strong surface technique. Eventually, simplification in his surface technique became apparent. The half-figure Martine is also one of Raudberget's best works. As a sculptor, Raudberget uses a figurative approach and is considered representative of the classical orientation in postwar sculpture. He has worked extensively with portraits and medals. Raudberget started drawing animals as a child and has he retained his interest in them as a sculptor. He has created many animal sculptures, often executed in hammered and driven metal. Since the mid-1970s horses' heads and horse figures have been an increasing part of his work. Among other works, his horse sculptures stand in his hometown of Rissa, in Oslo's Bjerkebanen neighborhood, and at the Hå Museum in Jæren. Raudberget's Hest og mann (Horse and Man) along the main road in Horgen in Nedre Eiker also well known. In addition to his sculptures, Raudberget has also produced many drawings and paintings.

Jones I (February 27, 1890 – August 18, 1967) was an American naval architect, business executive, and philanthropist. He served as a general manager and Vice President of the Gulf Oil corporation during the late 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Jones was one of the instrumental figures in establishing effective transport of crude oil from Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to the United States in the first half of the 20th century.Craig Thompson, Since Spindletop: A Human Story of Gulf's First Half-Century (Pittsburgh: Gulf Oil, 1951)Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991) Early life and education Willard F. Jones in the 1920s Jones was born to William F. Jones I and Mary Ellen Jones on February 27, 1890, in New York. His father was a shipping agent of Anglo- Welsh descent, and his mother was of Irish descent.Year: 1900; Census Place: Brooklyn Ward 10, Kings, New York; Page: 8; Enumeration District: 0137 He had three younger siblings: Helen, Herbert, and Mary. Jones began his career as deck boy aboard the Northeastern, a tanker under charter to the J.M. Guffey Petroleum Company, which was a forerunner to Gulf Oil. By the age of 20, he had ascended up the hierarchy of the company and was employed as an oil transport purchasing agent.Year: 1910; Census Place: Brooklyn Ward 6, Kings, New York; Roll: T624_957; Page: 5A; Enumeration District: 0075; FHL microfilm: 1374970 Jones graduated from the Cooper Union with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and went on to receive additional graduate education at both Columbia School of Mines and Harvard Business School. Career Willard F. Jones delivers a speech at the reception of the launch of the S.S. San Tome from Sparrow's Point, Maryland on November 16, 1949 After completing his schooling from Cooper Union, in 1913 Jones was placed in charge of Gulf Oil's Marine Department purchasing and small boat operations in New York harbor. Five years later, in 1918, he was promoted to Assistant Marine Superintendent for the company and became a member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers; in 1929 he became Marine Superintendent of Gulf Oil. Jones established himself as a prominent marine engineer and naval architect who designed large scale oil tankers for the Gulf Oil corporation over several decades. He worked for Gulf Oil for fifty-two years in total, the longest service of any employee in the company's history. He became general manager of Gulf Oil in 1936 and a Vice President in 1949. Jones retired from this latter position in 1955. While serving as general manager and Vice President of Gulf Oil, Jones facilitated the expansion of crude oil import from Kuwait, a nation that was – at the time – a yet incipient supply region to the United States. This expansion program implemented by Robert E. Garret and Jones consisted of construction of a fleet of supertankers and was meant to \\"result in a sharp increase in the processing of crude oil and various petroleum products at a time when the domestic demand for (such) products (was) at an unprecedented peak.\\". Jones also focused on the efficiency of foreign oil import into the United States, and lobbied to Robert Sikes in the House of Representatives on behalf of expanded and more expedient entry into the Port St. Joe channel in Florida in the aftermath of the Second World War, which at that time, represented the eastern terminus of the southeastern pipeline of the United States. Jones held other numerous ancillary leadership positions apart from his Gulf Oil concern. During World War II, he served as chairman of the American Committee of Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Jones was also the General Chairman of the National Safety Council's Marine Section of 1947–1948, chairman of the tanker committee of the American Petroleum Institute, a director of the American Merchant Marine Institute, and was elected president of the Propeller Club in 1955. Personal life, death, and legacy William Larimer Mellon Sr. letter to Willard F. Jones, June 14, 1948 Jones married Ruth Black in 1916; Black was a scion of both the famous Perry and Rodgers naval family dynasties. With his wife Ruth, he had two sons: Willard E. Jones USN and Lloyd P. Jones. They resided in Clearwater, Florida, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, respectively. In 1955, Jones provided the passage to and from Venezuela for Bassett Maguire in his landmark trip to further explore the Guyana Highlands mountain ranges of the Amazonian basin, in which the sandstone massif Cerro de la Neblina was discovered. Jones was a personal friend of Gulf Oil's founder William Larimer Mellon Sr., and the two maintained a direct correspondence until the latter's death in 1949. At the time of his retirement from Gulf Oil, Jones was considered \\"one of the most widely experienced Marine executives in the United States.\\" He continued to pursue consulting work in the field of naval architecture and shipping following his retirement. Jones died on August 18, 1967, at the White Plains Hospital in Westchester County, New York. His Requiem Mass was held at St. Anselm's Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn. Jones was interred in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery alongside his wife's grave, and amidst her family.

Established in 1900 by priest Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, it targeted members of the Catholic intelligentsia. Due to the Lithuanian press ban, it had to be printed in Tilsit, East Prussia (present-day Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast) and smuggled into Lithuania. The circulation was 500 copies. Due to its limited audience, the magazine could not financially support itself and after five issues was merged with Dirva, published in United States. History Lithuanian clergy began publishing Catholic-minded newspaper Tėvynės sargas in January 1896. From December 1897 to May 1902, it was edited by Juozas Tumas- Vaižgantas. Tėvynės sargas was geared towards the uneducated villagers and Tumas yearned for a magazine for the intelligentsia. He understood that the magazine would not be able to support itself financially and solicited donations. He obtained 885 rubles from , dean of Vadokliai. The plan was to publish four issues a year, but due to financial difficulties the issues were irregular. Two issues (155 and 96 pages) were published in 1900, one issue (99 pages) in 1901, and one double issue (127 pages) in 1902. For government purposes, the magazine needed to identify an editor who was a resident of East Prussia. Such official editor of Žinyčia was Prussian Lithuanian Jurgis Lapinas. Tumas, reassigned from Kuliai to near Kuršėnai in July 1901 and to near Naujamiestis in May 1902, could no longer edit either Tėvynės sargas or Žinyčia. In 1903, priest Antanas Milukas merged Žinyčia with Dirva, published in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, since 1898. The combined quarterly magazine was known as Dirva-Žinynas. Eight issues appeared before the joint publication was discontinued in 1904. The stand-alone Dirva continued to be published until 1906. Content Žinyčia was a cultural, not political magazine. In his opening letter, Tumas invited intellectuals of all political views to contribute. Tumas published translated works of bishop Motiejus Valančius and an article for the 100th anniversary of his birth. He also published a resume of a work by Princeton professor John Grier Hibben on self-identity (ego). The magazine devoted substantial attention to the issues of Lithuanian language, including grammar and spelling. Other articles analyzed the history of Lithuania, including an article by Jonas Basanavičius in which he presented his hypothesis that Lithuanians were descendants of Thracians and Phrygians. (pen name Savasis) published a review of Basanavičius' and Jonas Žilius' theories of Lithuanians' origins (issue 4–5, pages 1–8). Adomas Jakštas contributed several articles, including on Latin books published in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania and on Bible translations into Lithuanian. Kazimieras Macius (pen name Samogita) published a lengthy study on the Lithuanian folk songs, Pranciškus Būčys (signed P.B.) wrote a short article on what civilization is, Jurgis Šaulys (pen name Mažagetas) raised the issue of the national anthem and proposed Kur bėga Šešupė, kur Nemunas teka by Maironis (issue 4–5, pages 51–52). The magazine also published reviews of Lithuanian books and publications and literary works – poetry by Juozas Šnapštys (pen name Margalis), Mikalojus Šeižys (pen name Dagilėlis), short stories by (pen name Dėdė Atanazas), Marija Pečkauskaitė (pen name Šatrijos Ragana).

The film follows Tyree Battle (Grace) who takes Eli Zeal (Reynolds) to her hometown to recover after he is shot in the arm during a robbery committed by her 11 year old son. The film was produced by Cape Fear Filmworks and distributed by Cloud Ten Pictures. It was completed in 1998 and released on video in 2001. Plot Tyree Battle is told over the phone at merchant Eli Zeal's store her son Thaniel has played truant. Thaniel, under the influence of two thugs, shoots Eli in the arm after a failed robbery. Tyree discovers him next to a wounded Eli and decides to drive them to the store for supplies to help Eli. After asking if Eli has any relatives to notify, to which he denies, she calls her mother Viola and briefly tells her she'll be arriving in Waterproof, Louisiana, her hometown. When they reach Waterproof, she tells Viola she wants Thaniel to stay and that he needs schooling. Though happy of their arrival, Viola is annoyed by Eli and disheartened that Tyree is only staying one day. Sugar, a centenarian; and Natty Battle, the brother of Tyree who is a mentally challenged man, converse with Thaniel while Viola argues with Tyree on why she didn't write. 'Brother Big' Battle, a proud alcoholic, walks in and talks with Tyree, and sees Eli sleeping in the house. The police notice that no one is running Eli's store, so they ask Tyree's boss about her whereabouts. Tyree takes the bullets out of the gun that she took from Thaniel and throws them away. Eli demands to be taken to the hospital, but Tyre explains she doesn't want Thaniel to go to jail and that she will take him to a doctor in the morning. Viola, after talking with Tyree about Natty's mental disability supposedly from an accident caused by Brother Big and explains she got through with God's help. Tyree, who dislikes her beliefs, admits Thaniel has never been to church. In the morning, Sugar convinces Tyree to keep Eli at the house until he heals, while Thaniel is put in a new school. Chris Hardwick, a boy once raised by Viola, briefly greets Tyree and Eli. Thaniel plays truant again but is caught truant by Brother Big who gives him a can of beer. Thaniel is carried back drunk by Big. As discipline Viola takes him to church along with Tyree and Eli. The pastor asks Eli about himself, to which he says he grew up Jewish. Tyree tries to help Natty remember her, before going to Chris' house and tells him Viola won't be working for her. Chris realizes she is the cab driver in the news that disappeared. During the night, Natty goes to a river to swim while Thaniel secretly follows. Natty sees Thaniel and pulls him into the water. Thaniel attacks Natty with a board; Natty takes the board and hits Thaniel on the head. Big brings an unconscious Thaniel to a house. The next morning, Big calls Chris to help with Thaniel's non-fatal concussion. As they arrive home and Big tells Viola what happened, she gets angry as she believes he is lying and flies into a rage; afterward, in a conversation, Eli tells Chris that Thaniel shot him in the arm, yet he did not mean to. The FBI find the two thugs that committed the robbery and find letters to an address in Waterproof in Tyree's drawer. Tyree has an argument with Eli over the real reason she took them to Waterproof and confesses to accidentally hurting Natty instead of Big. She tells him that she was once in love with Chris; Big didn't approve and called for Natty's help, to which she hit Natty with a rock. Tyree leaves in the car alone, and along the way remembers a time when she was younger. As the rest of the family is at church, listening to the service, Tyree walks in and stands along the pew. At night, Eli says he will tell what happened at the store if Tyree does not tell Viola what happened with Natty. Eli, however, tells a police officer that he only took a vacation and that the blood in his store was a cut from a newspaper rack. On the porch, she tells Viola and Big the truth. Tyree is baptized by the church congregation joined with the entire family, which includes Big and Eli. In a post-credits scene, it is shown that Eli has sold the store to live in Waterproof.

Measuring roughly 14 acres (5.7 ha) in area, it is dominated by a ravine formed by an ephemeral stream that flows after heavy rainfall and consists of a series of muddy ponds otherwise. The park's main attraction is a small system of nature trails. Ravine Park is one of the only officially protected ravines in all of Lake County, Illinois and offers a refuge for nature in the densely inhabited suburbs of Chicago. Geology Looking west from within the ravine A view of Ravine Park from the Moffett Road bridge Ravine Park, as its name suggests, comprises one of the thirty or so ravines lining the North Shore of Chicago. The ravines formed as water drained from the high moraine bluffs north of Chicago into Lake Michigan after the retreat of the area's last glacier roughly 12,000 years ago. In general, the ravines of northeastern Illinois are as deep as and can extend up to inland from the lake. The ravine occupying Ravine Park in particular is roughly in length and about deep at its deepest. However, only half of this distance is easily traversed, with the rest of the steep-walled ravine trackless and covered in dense undergrowth. Ravine Park covers the great majority of the ravine, with only the extreme terminus falling in private property. The ravine faces significant erosion issues, discharging hundreds of tons of sediment into Lake Michigan each year. An extensive restoration project took place from 2010 to 2013, reducing the discharge rate by an estimated 300 tons annually. The project involved reinforcing a significant stretch of the ravine with stone and native plants while removing invasive plants and repairing storm drain outflows. History Even before Lake Bluff was incorporated as a village, the ravine that would come to comprise Ravine Park was furnished with paths and benches so that summer visitors could enjoy the natural scenery. The area formally transferred to the village in 1895, after which point it was administered by the Village Board until 1928. After the first Fourth of July parade in 1911, the committee responsible for organizing the parade committed itself to improving the village in various ways, leading the village to make the ravine a botanical garden. A Park Commission was formed and determined that 64 species of tree were present in the ravine shortly before establishing a nature path through the area. The Lake Bluff Park District was formed in 1925 and was granted control over Ravine Park in 1928. It continued to maintain the park up to the present day. Flora and Fauna Young Tilia americana in the ravine The ravines of the North Shore are dominated by temperate deciduous forests. The wind and cold air rising off Lake Michigan conspire to moderate the ravines' temperature, often keeping them significantly cooler than the surrounding area. As a result, the ravines tend to preserve a forest type containing elements similar to the forests of more northerly climes. A fairly large Acer saccharum in autumn The forest cover of Ravine Park is dominated by a mixture of sugar maples, basswood, and red oaks. Various other species, including the highly invasive Norway maple, also account for some of the biomass. The undergrowth is dominated by plants such as Virginia bluebells, mayapple, and trillium. The American witch-hazel is also present in small quantities. The more common animal denizens of Ravine Park include white-tailed deer, squirrels, and potentially a small population of coyotes. Birds present in the area include the black-capped chickadee and the American robin.

Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners of Australia It was originally established as the Australian District of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, initially forming part of the English trade union, with a carpenters' union having been active as early as the 1840s. It was first federally registered under that name in 1911. In 1922, it was renamed the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners of Australia, when it absorbed many members from the collapsing Australian Society of Progressive Carpenters and Joiners. Expanded coverage Discussions about merging the various building industry unions had begun by the 1930s, and in 1934, the New South Wales state carpenters' and bricklayers' unions merged as the Building Workers' Industrial Union, with approaches also being made to the plasterers', painters' and labourers' unions. In 1943, the issue of amalgamation on a broader scale emerged again. The federal Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners sought to expand its coverage to workers across the entire building industry, and changed its name to the Building Workers' Industrial Union, with a number of state-level unions merging into the union. In the same year, the New South Wales branch affiliated with the Australian Labor Party for the first time, breaking from the Carpenters' and Joiners' historical non-affiliation. The union suffered a setback in 1944 when the amalgamation of the Queensland state Carpenters' and Joiners' with Painters' and Decorators' Union and the Queensland branch of the Builders Labourers Federation to form a Queensland state branch of the BWIU was blocked in court after a challenge from the Australian Workers' Union and other rival unions. A second attempt was made later that year to merely rename the state Carpenters' and Joiners' Union as the BWIU, as had occurred federally, but was also blocked in court; the state union also lost on appeal the next year. The New South Wales branch was headed by Communist leadership through much of World War II, and faced an ongoing dispute over their coverage on the wharves with the newer and more conservative rival Ship Joiners' Society. Deregistration In August 1948, the union was deregistered by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in retribution for the Victorian branch's decision to order strike action regarding a claim that had been rejected by the court. Several attempts at re- registration were refused by the Court over the next several years. A federal executive continued to operate despite the deregistration, and the various branches continued operating at state level. A conservative splinter group re- registered a union under the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners name in 1952. The union was described by The Canberra Times in 1957 as \\"one of the most militant elements in the building trades' group of unions\\". In the late 1950s, the union supported exchanging preferences between the Labor Party and Communist Party, opposed nuclear weapons being based in Australia, and supported closer relations between Australia and the Soviet Union. Re- registration and amalgamation The BWIU eventually won federal re- registration in September 1962. The industrial registrar noted that the union had kept their much of their membership and their identity throughout the long period of deregistration. The re-registration resulted in a renewed competition for membership with the rival Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, which had benefited from their lengthy federal deregistration. In later years, the union clashed heavily with the Builders Labourers Federation, with the unions once described as \\"foremost enemies\\". In 1991, the union merged with the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union, itself a recent amalgamation of the Australian Timber Workers Union and the Pulp and Paper Workers Federation of Australia, to form the \\"ATAIU & BWIU Amalgamated Union\\". That union then merged into the Construction Forestry & Mining Employees Union in 1992, which in turn became the Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union later that year. Notable people associated with the union included Alfred Bennett, Pat Clancy, Peter Cook, Roger Degen, Jack Ferguson, Edward Greaves, Kate Lundy, Fred Newton, David Parker and Merv Toms.

Believed to have originated on American university campuses in the 1980s, it is thought to be the first documented instance of a drinking game using prompts from a television show to initiate player action. History The Bob Newhart Show, whose cast is pictured here in 1977, inspired the game Hi, Bob. The Bob Newhart Show was an American television program which aired on CBS between 1972 and 1978, subsequently running in syndication for many years thereafter. At various points during episodes of the program, characters would greet the main character, Bob Hartley (portrayed by Bob Newhart), by saying \\"Hi, Bob\\". Hi, Bob is believed to be the first documented instance of a drinking game using prompts from a television show to initiate player action. It may have originated among university students in the 1980s in the United States, who used a line in The Bob Newhart Show as inspiration for the game rules. In 1984 United Press International, citing a just-published book by Lisa Birnbach prepared from two years of her field research on U.S. university campuses, reported it was a \\"new game on campus\\". Bob Newhart has said he believes the game may have started at Southern Methodist University. The February 11, 1995, episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Bob Newhart, included a sketch starring Chris Farley and Chris Elliott in which the pair played Hi, Bob. In a 1998 column Frazier Moore described it as a \\"classic drinking game\\", with the implication it was no longer regularly played. Response of cast Bob Newhart has partly credited the syndicated appeal of his eponymous television show to Hi, Bob. During a 2001 interview, however, he also expressed concern that players might drive after playing it. Bill Daily, who played character Howard Borden on The Bob Newhart Show, has remarked on the game by noting that \\"we turned a lot of students into drunks\\". Rules The rules to \\"Hi, Bob\\" have been reported differently by various sources. According to the Tampa Tribune, while watching an episode of The Bob Newhart Show, one or more players are required to consume a shot of alcohol each time a character says \\"Hi, Bob\\". In one reported variation of the game, participants would shout \\"Hi, Bob!\\" in response to the utterance of the trigger phrase during the television program. In another variation of the game, shots of alcohol are replaced with cans of beer; each time a character utters the word \\"Bob\\", players consume a \\"generous gulp\\" of the beverage while the full phrase \\"Hi, Bob!\\" prompts complete consumption of the can. Lisa Birnbach, who witnessed the game in the early 1980s, reported that players would pass a bottle of beer around a room while watching The Bob Newhart Show. According to her, whoever was holding the bottle when the word \\"Bob\\" was uttered on the program would have to consume some of the beverage; if the full phrase \\"Hi, Bob!\\" was used, then the player would be required to consume the entire bottle.

In its standard configuration, the bells of the Aluphone are mounted on a frame, but it can also be played as a single handheld bell or as a stack of bells. The bells of the Aluphone are very durable, so they can be struck with a large variety of mallets, wands, or hammers depending on the tone that the musician seeks to produce. The Aluphone is closely associated with Evelyn Glennie, who played the instrument in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.  History  According to Harry Ellis, the idea for the Aluphone was developed at a trade show that two men, Michael Hansen and Kai Stensgaard, were separately attending. At the trade show, Hansen was showcasing aluminum cones that were designed to protect the tops of wooden posts. As a musician, Stensgaard was curious about the sound the cones would make when he struck. He was impressed with the tone created by the metal cones when struck and asked if Hansen could produce cones that would produce an assortment of unique pitches that could be incorporated into a playable instrument. Hansen agreed to work with Stensgaard on the project. In 2011, Stensgaard presented the Aluphone for the first time at PASIC, a convention held by the Percussive Arts Society. In an interview, Glennie stated that she was not involved in the creation of the original Aluphone. After becoming interested in the instrument, she worked with Hansen and Stensgaard to develop a new version of the Aluphone, sometimes called the Glennie Aluphone, for her to play at an upcoming performance of Caliban's Dream at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Stensgaard presented the Aluphone at PASIC again in 2013. Stensgaard stated: \\"A lot of people know the instrument now and really like the sound. Composers are writing for it.\\" Adam Schoenberg made use of the Aluphone in a 2013 orchestral composition called Bounce. He believes that it was the first time that original music was composed for the Aluphone in an orchestral arrangement. Anders Koppel Concerto for Aluphone and Symphony Orchestra.

He fought for the right to vote for Japanese-Canadians in provincial elections.  Early life and work  Homma was born in Japan to a Samurai- caste family. He emigrated 1883 and settled in Steveston and was naturalized as a British subject in 1896 (until 1947, Canadians were classified as British subjects). In Steveston, Homma was a labour organizer and founded the Japanese Fishermen’s Benevolent Society. Homma was also a key figure in the construction of the first Japanese school and a fishermen’s hospital in what is now Richmond; as well, he founded the first Japanese-language daily paper in Canada, the Canada Shinpo.  Court case for voting rights  Homma also fought for Asian-Canadian suffrage. Because he was denied the right to vote because of his ethnicity, Homma took the province of British Columbia to court. Homma was successful at the County Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which held that he was entitled to vote. The government of British Columbia then appealed the case to the imperial Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, which at that time was the highest court in the Canadian legal system. The federal government intervened in support of Homma, arguing that as a naturalised Canadian, federal law ensured he could vote in all elections, the same as native-born Canadians. In 1902, the Judicial Committee ruled against Homma, in its decision in Cunningham v Homma.Cunningham v Homma, [1902 UKPC 60, [1903] AC 151 (JCPC).] The Judicial Committee determined that while the federal government was responsible for the naturalisation of citizens, the provinces had the right to legislate who could vote in provincial and municipal elections. Asian Canadians would not garner the right to vote until 1949, four years after Homma died.  Internment and death  Homma was one of the many Japanese-Canadians interned during World War II. He died in a detention camp near Slocan, British Columbia.  Recognition  Parks Canada has designated Homma's court case as being of National Historical Significance. In recognition of his contribution to the democratic system, in December 2017 the Government of Canada, through Parks Canada, dedicated a plaque in his honour at the Nikkei National Museum and Cultural Centre in Burnaby.

Based on the wildcard syntax in common use, e.g. in the Microsoft Windows command-line interface, the algorithm provides a non- recursive mechanism for matching patterns in software applications, based on syntax simpler than that typically offered by regular expressions.  History  The algorithm is based on a history of development, correctness and performance testing, and programmer feedback that began with an unsuccessful search for a reliable non-recursive algorithm for matching wildcards. An initial algorithm, implemented in a single while loop, quickly prompted comments from software developers, leading to improvements. Ongoing comments and suggestions culminated in a revised algorithm still implemented in a single while loop but refined based on a collection of test cases and a performance profiler. The experience tuning the single while loop using the profiler prompted development of a two-loop strategy that achieved further performance gains, particularly in situations involving empty input strings or input containing no wildcard characters. The two-loop algorithm is available for use by the open-source software development community, under the terms of the Apache License v. 2.0, and is accompanied by test case code.  Usage  The algorithm made available under the Apache license is implemented in both pointer-based C++ and portable C++ (implemented without pointers). The test case code, also available under the Apache license, can be applied to any algorithm that provides the pattern matching operations below. The implementation as coded is unable to handle multibyte character sets and poses problems when the text being searched may contain multiple incompatible character sets. = Pattern matching operations = The algorithm supports three pattern matching operations: * A one-to-one match is performed between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match, with the exception of asterisk (*) or question mark (?) characters in the pattern. * An asterisk (*) character matches any sequence of zero or more characters. * A question mark (?) character matches any single character.  Examples  foo* matches any string containing \\"foo\\". * mini* matches any string that begins with \\"mini\\" (including the string \\"mini\\" itself). * ???* matches any string of three or more letters.  Applications  The original algorithm has been ported to the DataFlex programming language by Larry Heiges for use with Data Access Worldwide code library. It has been posted on GitHub in modified form as part of a log file reader. Lines 173-279. The 2014 algorithm is part of the Unreal Model Viewer built into the Epic Games Unreal Engine game engine.

Common uses of these algorithms include command-line interfaces, e.g. the Bourne shell or Microsoft Windows command-line or text editor or file manager, as well as the interfaces for some search engines and databases. Wildcard matching is a subset of the problem of matching regular expressions and string matching in general.  The problem  A wildcard matcher tests a wildcard pattern p against an input string s. It performs an anchored match, returns true only when p matches the entirety of s. The pattern can be based on any common syntax (see globbing), but on Windows programmers tend to only discuss a simplified syntax supported by the native C runtime: * No escape characters are defined * Wildcards: matches exactly one occurrence of any character. matches arbitrary many (including zero) occurrences of any character. This article mainly discusses the Windows formulation of the problem, unless otherwise stated. = Definition = Stated in zero-based indices, the wildcard-matching problem can be defined recursively as: : \\\\begin{aligned} m_{00} &= (p_{0} = t_{0}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{0j} &= (p_{j-1} = \\\\text{\`*'}) \\\\land m_{0,j-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{i0} & = \\\\text{false} \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{ij} &= \\\\begin{cases} m_{i-1, j-1} & \\\\text{for}\\\\; p_{i-1} = t_{j-1} \\\\lor p_{i-1} = \\\\text{\`?'}\\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{i, j-1} \\\\lor m_{i-1, j} & \\\\text{for}\\\\; p_{i-1} = \\\\text{\`*'}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{false} & \\\\text{for}\\\\; p_{i-1} eq t_{j-1} \\\\end{cases} & & \\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\; 1 \\\\leq i \\\\le p, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\le t. \\\\end{aligned} where mij is the result of matching the pattern p against the text t truncated at i and j characters respectively. This is the formulation used by Richter's algorithm and the Snippets algorithm found in Cantatore's collection. This description is similar to the Levenshtein distance. = Related problems = Directly related problems in computer science include: * Pattern matching with don't cares or gaps, an unanchored string search with only the equiavelent of defined. * Pattern matching with wildcards, an unanchored string search with the equiavelent of both wildcards defined. Has an exponential runtime unless a length-bound is given in the pattern matching with flexible wildcards variant.  History  Early algorithms for matching wildcards often relied on recursion, but the technique was criticized on grounds of performance and reliability considerations. Non-recursive algorithms for matching wildcards have gained favor in light of these considerations. Among both recursive and non-recursive algorithms, strategies for performing the pattern matching operation vary widely, as evidenced among the variety of example algorithms referenced below. Test case development and performance optimization techniques have been demonstrably brought to bear on certain algorithms, particularly those developed by critics of the recursive algorithms.  Recursive algorithms  The recursion generally happens on matching \`*\` when there is more suffix to match against. This is a form of backtracking, also done by some regular expression matchers. * Rich Salz' wildmat algorithm (sh-like syntax) * Filip's algorithm and Vignesh Murugesan's Algorithm * Martin Richter's algorithm (identical to Snippets and related to the 7-zip algorithm) * C library fnmatch implementations (supports \`[...]\` and multibyte character sets):  Guido van Rossum's BSD libc fnmatch, also part of Apple libc  Glibc fnmatch The general form of these algorithms are the same. On recursion the algorithm slices the input into substrings, and considers a match to have happened when ONE of the substrings return a positive match. For , it would greedily call , , and . They usually differ by less-important things like support for features and by more important factors such as minor but highly effective optimizations. Some of them include: * The ABORT signal against over-recursion (Lars Mathiesen 1991). While it is correct to naively recurse by the entire rest of the strings (pattern and text) on \`*\` and making sure that ONE of the substrings return a positive match, the running time becomes exponential for rejecting a match with many \`*\` in the text. Lars Mathiesen changes the return to three classes, match, no-match, and ABORT (no match possible at all for asterisk recursion.) The ABORT value is returned when the text is consumed too early or when another asterisk match has failed, guaranteeing a linear performance with respect to the number of asterisks. (The overall complexity is additionally quadratic to the number of characters left to match.) Git/Rsync's wildmatch ABORT also covers invalid inputs. The new INN uwildmat does the same. * Asterisk advancement in recursion. This wildmatch tweak is relatively more minor. It applies to when the recursion wants to match \\"*X\\" on \\"abcX\\": when an asterisk is followed by a literal like \\"X\\", it is obvious that only the last comparison with equal lengths would have a chance of producing a match. This is seen earlier in uwildmat in 2000 and more implicitly in van Rossum's fnmatch for . Martin Richter's algorithm is an exception to this pattern, although the overall operation is equivalent. On * it recurses into increasing either of the indexes, following the dynamic programming formulation of the problem. The \\"ABORT\\" technique is applicable to it as well. On typical patterns (as tested by Cantatore) it is slower than the greedy-call implementations. The recursive algorithms are in general easier to reason about, and with the ABORT modification they perform acceptably in terms of worst-case complexity. On strings without * they take linear-to-string-size time to match since there is a fixed one-to-one relation.  Non-recursive algorithms  The following are developed by critics of the recursive algorithms: * Kirk J. Krauss's wildcard-matching algorithm, used by IBM * Alessandro Cantatore's collection of wildcard matching algorithms * Dogan Kurt's iterative matcher and slower NFA matcher. * Siler's algorithm (fails ) The following is not: * Jack Handy's algorithm (fails ) The iterative functions above implement backtracking by saving an old set of pattern/text pointers, and reverting to it should a match fails. According to Kurt, since only one successful match is required, only one such set needs to be saved. In addition, the problem of wildcard matching can be converted into regular expression matching using a naive text-replacement approach. Although non- recursive regular expression matchers such as Thompson's construction are less used in practice due to lack of backreference support, wildcard matching in general does not come with a similarly rich set of features. (In fact, many of the algorithms above only has support for and .) The Russ Cox implementation of Thompson NFA can be trivially modified for such. Gustavo Navarro's -based nrgrep algorithm provides a more steamlined implementation with emphasis on efficient suffixes. See also .

Provisions  The act resembled the Sunday Observance Act 1677 passed by the Parliament of England.; The Irish act affirmed that people should be attending church and not working on Sundays except for necessary or emergency works.Sunday Observance Act 1695, s.1 The fine for violating was 5 shillings. The act granted an exemption to public houses and inns and to hackney carriages in Dublin between the hours of 10am and 4pm.Sunday Observance Act 1695, s.3 It also had the effect of specifically banning sports being played on Sunday in Ireland on the grounds that they led to \\"tumultuous and disorderly meetings\\" which interfered with observance of the Sabbath.Sunday Observance Act 1695, s.3; In law, it prohibited the publication or execution of writs, judgements or warrants on Sundays and held that the \\"hundreds\\" (i.e. baronies) were not responsible for any robberies that occurred on Sunday unless the hue and cry was raised.Sunday Observance Act 1695, ss.3–5 Later history The act meant that those ordinarily in fear of being sent to debtors' prison could emerge from hiding on Sundays; one case hinged on whether the clock had struck midnight before the debtor's arrest.; citing Rowe's Reports p.431 In the nineteenth century, Sabbatarians advocated use of the act to prevent playing of sports on Sundays, which was common in rural areas. From 1872, Royal Irish Constabulary policy was to permit Sunday sports events unless they were likely to lead to a breach of the peace. The Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878 repealed sections 6 and 11, and section 9 \\"so far as it relates to the appropriation of penalties\\". The Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1879 repealed section 5 and part of section 3 so far as it relates to the appropriation of penalties.

The act was repealed in the Republic by the Criminal Law Act 1997. In the 1990s the act remained in force and was utilised by Northern Ireland district councils as grounds to close parks and leisure centres on Sundays.HC Deb vol 262 c866 An adjournment debate in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom led by the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Seamus Mallon in 1995 criticised the act and requested it be repealed. The Northern Ireland Office minister Malcolm Moss stated that they would look into amending some of the provisions of the act; his legal advice was that leisure centres open on Sunday \\"could technically be in breach\\" of the act but that \\"the chances of a successful prosecution ... are considered remote\\".HC Deb vol 262 c870 Section 7 has been affirmed as valid by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Human Rights legal advisor and still remains in force in Northern Ireland which prevents the PSNI issuing warrants on Sunday.

History  The portrait depicts a young boy, who is named as \\"Eutyches, freedman of Kasanios\\" by an inscription on the portrait. The work was produced after the boy's death, and as such the image is classified as one of the Fayum mummy portraits. Such mortuary portraits were popular as an artistic medium in the 1st century AD during the Roman Empire's rule over Egypt, which was dominated by an upper class of ethnic Greeks.

The portrait, done in encaustic paint on wood panel, was intended to be placed on the face of deceased after they were mummified.

The portrait makes use of light and dark colors coupled with broad brush strokes to model the boy's face. The olive background of the panel is used to contrast the subject's deep tan complexion and dark hair, as well as to create a sense of depth.

The design and customs associated with it originated in ancient Latgalian lands, which is the easternmost of the four historical regions of Latvia. The ring, as currently known, was first produced in the 12th century. The Namejs ring is a common symbol in Latvian culture. In 1928, Aleksandrs Grīns wrote a novel titled “Nameja gredzens” (“Ring of Namejs”), which popularized the ring and its symbolism. In 2018, Aigars Grauba produced a film called The Pagan King (), which depicts an alternate version of the ring's legend.  Description  The Namejs ring has become a central figure in Latvian jewelry, because of its design and mythological significance. In the 20th century, there was an explosion of interest in the Namejs ring in Baltics, both as jewelry and as an icon of Latvian identity. It is mostly worn by men, but in modern times there are also women who wear it. The material of the ring is mostly silver, but it can also be made out of gold or bronze. The classic Namejs ring consists of three main bands woven around each other, but in recent years, more intricate ones have many embellishments, such as smaller twists of silver woven in with the larger bands.  Origins  The ring was first found in ancient Latgalian lands. The name “Namejs” derives from the Semigallian legend about the political and military leader Namejs in the late 13th century. Although this legend has become popular, in reality, these rings date from the late 12th- early 13th century. It has been discovered that Namejs wasn’t alive when the first rings were made in the 12th century; archeologists found the rings mostly in ancient Latgalian lands, proving that Namejs could not have any connection to the ring. The name \\"Namejs ring\\" was not used before the 1920s, when two originals were found in ancient graves of Latgale and they become a popular kind of jewelry to imitate. The Namejs ring is a rare archeologist’s find. It has been determined that it would have been a very expensive item to own in the 12th century, as it is mostly made from silver and the manufacturing process was long and complex.  Folk legends  There are many legends about the origins of the Namejs ring, particularly concerning Namejs, the leader of the Semigallians in the 13th century, who is said to have invented the Namejs design as it is popularly known. According to the legend, Namejs was one of the last warriors to fight against the invasion of the German crusaders into the territory of Latvia. He fled into exile in Lithuania, but as a parting gift, he gave his son a twisted metal ring so that the boy would be recognizable by his father upon return. Namejs’ son was imperiled when the Germans discovered the secret of the ring. The Germans went out in a search of Namejs’ son in order to Christianize him and force him to surrender. It is said that almost all of the Semigallian boys and men made similar rings and wore them in order to protect the boy’s identity. According to another legend, German crusaders were slowly moving into Latvian territory in the middle ages, taking over tribe after tribe. After a battle lost against German knights, Namejs was forced to retreat to Lithuania together with his family and tribe. There he ordered the rings to be made and gave them to his closest people as a symbol of friendship and trust. The close braids express the solidarity of the Latvian nation.  Popularization  The ring’s popularity has been encouraged by various factors. Latvian writer Aleksandrs Grīns wrote a novel titled “Nameja gredzens” (“Ring of Namejs”) in 1928. The ring described in the novel is different, but society understood the idea of the Grīns story when it was presented on stage. The unique ring was given the identity and the name that made it an embodiment of the power of the Latvian leader Namejs. In 1936, painter Ludolfs Liberts painted the archeological ring on a finger of his fantasy portrait of Namejs. Namejs ring was presented to the president Kārlis Ulmanis by his ideologues, developing myths in order to legitimize the leader using pseudo-historic analogies, including positioning Ulmanis as \\"heir of Namejs\\".  Usage and symbolism  In the 1930s, the Namejs ring symbolized boys going into manhood. Fathers presented this ring to their sons on the day of their coming of age, and that was the only way to get it. The close bonds symbolized the family and the importance of being united. Each ring is handmade by a jeweler, individually twisted, and symbolizes an idea about being unique, but in close relationships with others, similar to the individual. It also connected with the possible motto of Namejs, “One for all and everyone for one.” The Namejs ring has become a central icon of Latvian jewelry. The three twisted silver parts symbolize the unity of three ancient Latvian lands- Kurzeme, Latgale and Vidzeme, that these days constitute the territory of Latvia. The ring is a sign of Latvian identity.  In culture  = Latvian lats = 1 Latvian lats with Namejs ring On June 8, 2009, the Bank of Latvia issued a new coin of 1 Latvian lats with the Namejs ring, which encloses the numeral 1, on the reverse. It was legal tender in the Republic of Latvia until the adoption of the Euro currency in 2014. The graphic design was made by Ilze Lībiete, and the plaster model by Baiba Šime. = Novel = Nameja gredzens (Ring of Namejs) is a novel by Aleksandrs Grīns published in 1928 about ancient Semigallian leader Namejs.

It was painted at a key phase in Picasso's life, as he made the transition from an impoverished bohemian at the start of 1905 to a successful artist by the end of 1906. After achieving some early success in 1901, Picasso was still struggling by 1905, living in penury in Montmartre. The work was painted at the new studio that he took on the top floor of the dilapidated building at 13 , which the poet Max Jacob termed the \\"Le Bateau-Lavoir\\". Other floors were occupied by other artists. The Cirque Médrano was nearby, and Picasso was inspired by the harlequins and saltimbanques, clowns, jugglers and other acts, making the transition from his bleak Blue period to his more optimistic Rose period. Young Girl with a Flower Basket was made in the autumn of 1905, after Picasso returned to Paris from spending six weeks in the countryside in the northern Netherlands. The subject is a young girl who was working as a flower seller, but also probably as a teenage child prostitute. She is depicted naked, save for pink ribbons in her dark hair and a necklace, and she is holding a basket of red flowers, all painted with simplified lines and flattened blocks of colour. Many of Picasso's paintings of this period combine conflicting elements of innocence and of experience. It was reported by John Richardson in his exhibition catalogue for the Late Picasso exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1988 (p. 340), based on the writings of Jean-Paul Crespelle, that the subject was called \\"Linda la Bouquetière\\", from the Place du Tertre, and she worked outside the Moulin Rouge. She also worked as an artist's model; in addition to Picasso, she was painted by Kees van Dongen and Amedeo Modigliani. An earlier pen and ink sketch suggests Picasso originally planned to paint her in a white dress, as if attending her first communion, with the red flowers symbolising the blood of the eucharist. The painting is signed \\"Picasso\\", and inscribed \\"Picasso 1905 13 Rue Ravignan\\" on the reverse. It measures . Picasso sold the painting to the Galerie du Vingtième Siècle run by art dealer near the gallery of Ambroise Vollard. Sagot drove a hard bargain. He originally offered 700 francs for three works - this painting, and two works in gouache made in the Netherlands. Picasso initially refused, but desperate for money he returned to take up Sagot's offer a few days later. Sagot cannily cut his offer to 500 francs, which Picasso also refused. Forced by his poverty to return to Sagot again some days later, the work was eventually sold for just 75 francs, and put up for sale in Sagot's gallery as La fleur du pavé (\\"The flower of the cobblestones\\"). It became the second of three Rose period paintings acquired by the collectors Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein. The Stein siblings had been living in Paris from 1903, and began collecting contemporary artworks in 1904, buying works by Cézanne, Gauguin and Renoir from Ambroise Vollard. Sagot sold Picasso's Famille d'acrobates avec singe (1905) to Leo Stein, and the couple later acquired Fillette à la corbeille fleurie. The Steins quarrelled about this second purchase, as Leo wanted it but Gertrude did not; in the end Gertrude relented and they bought it for 150 francs. In time, Gertrude came to appreciate the painting and later acquired Leo's share. In 1938, Gertude Stein wrote that it \\"was painted at the great moment of the harlequin period, full of grace and delicacy and charm\\". Later in 1905, Henri-Pierre Roché introduced the Steins to Picasso and they became friends, buying Femme au bras levé (1905) direct from the artist. He completed a portrait of Gertrude Stein in 1906. The acquisitions by the Steins were to mark the beginnings of Picassos commercial success, and by the end of 1906 his works were being bought by Vollard. After Gertrude Stein died, the painting was retained by her estate, and then sold in 1968 to the Syndicate of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but quickly resold later that year to David Rockefeller and Peggy Rockefeller. After David Rockefeller's death in 2017, it was sold at Christie's on 8 May 2018 with other works from the Rockefeller collection, achieving a sale price of $115 million.Rockefeller Picasso sells for $115 million including fees, CNBC, 8 May 2018 File:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Acrobat's Family with a Monkey (Famille au Singe), collage, gouache, watercolor, pastel and india ink on carboard, 104 x 75 cm, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Goteburg.jpgFamille d'acrobates avec singe, 1905, Göteborgs Konstmuseum GertrudeStein.JPGPortrait of Gertrude Stein, 1906, Metropolitan Museum of Art See also * List of most expensive paintings References * Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), Fillette à la corbeille fleurie, Feature essay, Christies, 2018 * Live like a Rockefeller – Picasso’s Fillette à la corbeille fleurie, Christies, 2018 * Picasso and the Painting That Shocked the World, Miles J.

The majority of the architects in this movement were graduates from the State Art Institute in the early 1970s. This group included Kaljundi, Avo-Himm Looveer, Ain Padrik, Jüri Okas, and Ignar Fjuk, as well as Veljo Kaasik and Toomas Rein from an older generation of architects.

Lk 315, 414  Architectural Career  Early in his career, Kaljundi was an architectural assistant at the Estonian Academy of Arts. He worked at the Estonian Land Development Project for five years starting in 1970, and following that he worked at the Tentrosojuz Project. In the early 1980s, Kaljundi promoted small town development and was against the Soviet urban development policies of the time. Kajlundi responded to the new mass apartment blocks being constructed by advocating for a polar opposite solution: the post-modernist villa. During this time period, he also worked on landscaping, working on projects including the Rakvere castle hills, Tartu Toomemägi and the Sinimäe memorial. Kajlundi also created other plans for urban development that were later implemented, including the consolidation of the Kuressaare city center and reconstruction of its cultural library. In 1988 he joined the Union of Estonian Architects and in 1997 he established his own office. During this part of his career, his style gradually shifted away from his style of functionalism and moved towards constructivism and conceptualism, which he used to create his own home in Merivälja towards the end of his career.Leonhrad Lapin (2015).

It is served by line S2 of the Rhine- Main S-Bahn.  History Steinberg station was opened on 1 December 1898 as a single-track Haltepunkt (halt) along with the Offenbach-Bieber–Dietzenbach railway, a line that branches off the Rodgau Railway (Rodgaubahn) in Offenbach-Bieber. Trains ran on this line between Dietzenbach (Hess) station and Offenbach Hauptbahnhof. Passenger services on the line were discontinued on 18 June 1982, because traffic on it had been significantly affected by increasing car ownership. The line was then used only for a small amount of freight traffic and the rail passenger services were replaced by buses. Services on line S2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn commenced at the 2003/2004 timetable change on 14 December 2003. In the course of the development of the line for the S-Bahn, the track layout at the station was altered and the line was double-tracked and electrified. The station received an island platform for S-Bahn operations from 2001 to 2003 and the entrances were rebuilt to be barrier-free for the disabled.  Infrastructure  The station has 2 platforms tracks around an island platform. The tracks towards Dietzenbach station and towards Offenbach run at ground level. There is a set of points on the track towards Offenbach that connects to a siding that until the autumn of 2008 was still regularly used by so-called \\"Banana Express\\" to supply a local vegetable wholesaler.

Coddington named and circumscribed the genus in 1986. It is a Neotropical genus and it is limited to South America. , nine species are recognized. They are found in caves and have a distinctive cubic egg sac. The generic name comes from the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. Diagnosis Diagnostic features include: the base of the epigynum in female Plato species having a median projection; the cymbium having distal or mesal groves; and the underside of the male conductor having a curved apophysis. Biology Plato orb webs hang from the ceilings and walls near the entrance of caves. They are typically found in humid environments, near streams or other bodies of water. Webs lack a tension line. Although they are troglobitic, they have no specific modifications for living in caves or other dark places. Their egg sacs are cubical, and are suspended in long threads from their vertices. Each egg sac can contain between eight and seventeen eggs. The diet of Plato species consists of small flying insects such as chironomids and other flies, tineid moths, and caddisflies. Species , the World Spider Catalog recognizes the following nine species: * P. bicolor — Brazil * P. bruneti — Trinidad * P. ferriferus — Brazil * P. guacharo — Venezuela * P. juberthiei — French Guiana * P. miranda — Venezuela * P. novalima — Brazil * P. striatus — Brazil * P. troglodita — Ecuador Taxonomic history Female P. bicolor, illustrated by Eugen von Keyserling in 1886 Jonathan A. Coddington, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History, circumscribed the genus Plato in a 1986 revision of the family Theridiosomatidae. He designated P. troglodita, which he described in the same work, to be the type species of the genus. The other species he included in his initial circumscription had been initially described in the genera Maymena (P. bruneti) and Wendilgarda (P. miranda, P. guacharo, and P. bicolor). André Lopez at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique described P. juberthiei in 1996, and Pedro H. Prete and colleagues at the Instituto Butantan described the three species P. novalima, P. ferriferus, and P. striatus in 2018. Coddington named the genus after the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. Coddington's reasoning were their \\"strikingly cubical egg sacs\\" and their \\"partiality for caves.\\" These relate to the philosopher by way of the Platonic solids and the Allegory of the Cave, respectively. The generic name is masculine in gender. Coddington placed Plato in a new subfamily Platoninae, alongside the genus Chthonos. In 2011, the German arachnologist changed the status of Platoninae to be the tribe Platonini in the subfamily Theridiosomatinae instead, although Prete and colleagues followed Coddington in having Plato in the subfamily Platoninae. Distribution Plato is found in the Neotropical realm. Its range is limited to South America (including the island of Trinidad), within the countries Brazil, Ecuador, Trinidad & Tobago, and Venezuela, as well as in the French overseas region French Guiana.

The party, which took the name of \\"Autonomist Piedmont\\", was soon involved in the formation of a federation of Northern Italian regionalist parties, Lega Nord, and was transformed into Lega Nord Piemont (LNP).

Biography Ainsley was born in North Shields in Northumberland. In 1973 she completed the one-year foundation course at the Jacob Kramer College in Leeds and until 1977 she studied painting at Newcastle Polytechnic. In 1975 she spent six weeks in Japan studying Sukiya architecture which led to her using a very limited palette of colours but with an emphasis on texture and materials. After graduating from Newcastle, Ainsley spent a year in postgraduate study at Edinburgh College of Art. When she completed her post-graduate diploma there in 1978, an Andrew Grant fellowship award allowed to her to teach part-time in the same department for a year. Following a visit to New York City in 1979, Ainsley began using unstretched, shaped canvases and her work developed from monochrome canvases into abstract shapes using the full colour spectrum Her Postgraduate work was heavily influenced by her time in Japan and her interest in Japanese culture In 1982 Ainsley created a series of banners for the inauguration of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art's new building in Edinburgh. A commission for a thirty-foot tapestry woven at the Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh for the headquarters building of the General Accident insurance company in Perth was completed in 1983. Her 1985 Banner for Greenham represented Ainsley's political concerns and featured images of the circle of women protesting at Greenham Common. A solo show of Ainsley's work was held at the Third Eye Centre in Glasgow in 1987, a semi autobiographical installation entitled 'Why I Choose Red', her first major one person exhibition in Scotland. In 2004 she was also included in the permanent collection of women artists in the New Hall, Cambridge collection. From 1985 Ainsley taught at the Glasgow School of Art in Environmental Art before co-founding the School's MFA course in 1989 with fellow GSA lecturer John Calcutt. Ainsley was appointed as the MFA programme director in 1991 and held the post until 2005.

It was active from 1976 to 1980, and included the production company Barn Productions and publishing company Barn Publishing Ltd. The label was based at Portland Studios in London, which was formerly known as IBC Studios until Chandler purchased them in 1978. The label's most notable artist was Slade, while others included The Animals, Medicine Head, The Depressions, Stavely Makepeace, Nick Van Eede and Splinter. History Chandler formed Barn in early 1976. At the time, he had been the manager of the successful British rock band Slade since 1969 and convinced them to sign with his new label. Chandler originally negotiated a licensing deal with Polydor, who agreed to finance the label based on the strength of the Slade name. The label's debut single release was \\"Love on My Mind\\" by Brian Parrish, released in July 1976. Barn released only two singles which made an entry into the UK charts. The first was Slade's \\"Gypsy Roadhog\\", which reached No. 48 in the UK. The second was Slade's \\"My Baby Left Me\\", released later in 1977, which gave Barn its highest charting single at No. 32.

Singles such as \\"Burning in the Heat of Love\\", \\"Rock 'n' Roll Bolero\\", \\"Ginny, Ginny\\" and \\"Sign of the Times\\" all failed to sell and most copies were melted down. In 1976, The Animals reunited and recorded a new album, which was released the following year on Barn as Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The band were billed as \\"The Original Animals\\". Other album releases on Barn included Brian Parrish's Love on My Mind (1976), Medicine Head's Two Man Band (1976) and Slade's Whatever Happened to Slade (1977) and Return to Base (1979). Barn's final release was the Ada Wilson single \\"In the Quiet of My Room\\", released in January 1980. Following this, Chandler established the short-lived Six of the Best label, and was also involved in the independent Cheapskate Records during 1980-82.

It has a heart-shaped to more or less round leaf and a single reddish purple flower with greyish translucent areas. It is a natural hybrid between C. diemenicus and C. incurvus and shares the characteristics of the parent species.  Description  Corybas × miscellus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which forms colonies. It has an egg-shaped, heart- shaped or almost round leaf long and wide. The leaf is dark green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. The single flower is more or less erect, bright reddish purple with greyish translucent areas, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is mostly transparent grey with reddish purple streaks, long and wide. It is erect near its base then curves forward, protruding over the labellum. The lateral sepals and petals are linear, about long, wide and tapered. The labellum is longer than the dorsal sepal and forms a tube long near its base, before curving and flattening into a concave dish shape, long and wide. The upper part of the labellum is reddish with darker veins except for a white mound in the centre and many short red teeth around the edges. Flowering occurs in August and September.  Taxonomy  Corybas × miscellus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near the Barossa Reservoir and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (miscellus) is a Latin word meaning \\"mixed\\", referring to the hybrid origin of this species. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The hybrid helmet orchid grows in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata in the Mount Lofty Ranges. There is also a population growing in woodland near Edenhope in far western Victoria.

Biography  Born in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, Tagrine learns the piano with two Russian refugee pianists, Lubochitzand Kamtchattoff then at the Conservatoire de Paris with Lazare-Lévy, Yves Nat and Joseph Calvet for chamber music. Thereafter, always seeking to perfect herself, she will enrich her knowledge, among others, with Vlado Perlemuter, Samson François, her classmate from the Conservatoire and finally, in 1956, with György Sebők. Her admiration, her esteem for the latter were immense: it is the one who made her deepen the world of flexibility (discovered thanks to Lazare-Lévy) as well as the game based entirely on relaxation and the search for beautiful sound. On his advice, she stopped giving concerts for a year in order to totally modify her technique and adapt to that of the Hungarian school. On 25 August 1944, she tragically lost her younger brother Michel (Liberation Cross posthumously), a 21-year-old violinist and student of Galamian, and a few months later her father Boris, a doctor. Fate then made her meet Roland-Manuel who was looking for a voice for a dialogue radio program. He will be her spiritual father and from October 1944 she will host with him the famous broadcast \\"Plaisir de la Musique\\". It was a live, public program that took place every Sunday at the Salle Favart. The dialogues between Tagrine and Roland-Manuel were interspersed with pieces played as soloist or with orchestra by Tagrine. Manuel Rosenthal, Lily Laskine, Francis Poulenc, Henri Dutilleux, Claude Delvincourt, Arthur Honegger, Irène Joachim and Jacques Chailley were among the many personalities invited to dialogue with them. The 667th and last broadcast took place in October 1966. Four booksPlaisir de la Musique, Éditions du Seuil ()WorldCat were derived from these programmes and translated into German, Spanish and Japanese. Tagrine will produce alone other radio programs : \\"Toccata et variation sur un piano\\", every 15 days from 1958 to 1972, and \\"Interprètes d’hier et d’aujourd’hui\\",Anciennes grilles France Musique on Radioscope from 1972 to 1975. During a tour of Scotland in 1947, she met her husband Marc-André Béra, a Normalien with an agrégation in English, then director of the Institut Français in Edinburgh. They remained married for nearly 40 years, until his death on 31 March 1990. They had two children together: Michel, another Normalien, agrégé in mathematics, and Nathalie, pianist. Tagrine gave numerous concerts both in France and abroad. She has performed as a soloist under the direction of conductors such as Ernest Ansermet, Manuel Rosenthal, Tony Aubin, , Jean-François Paillard, Fernand Oubradous, and Serge Baudo. Her repertoire was immense. She combined all periods, all styles, with the same desire to discover and make her contemporaries love music. Among them were Francis Poulenc, Henri Sauguet, Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Jacques Ibert, Georges Auric, Jean Françaix, Daniel-Lesur, Germaine Tailleferre, Olivier Messiaen. She also premiered several works written for her: \\"Nocturne-Songe\\" by Roland- Manuel - 13 naive paintings by Alain Bernaud - \\"Danse des pantins\\" by Jean Rivier - Mon piano (12 easy pieces) by Jacques Chailley. Her chamber music partners were first her brother Michel, then among others the violinists Devy Erlih and Yvonne Astruc,Yvonne Astruc on Data.bnf.fr cellists Paul Bazelaire, Maurice Gendron, and Maurice Baquet, flutists Marcel Moyse and Jean-Pierre Rampal. She taught in the upper grades at the Schola Cantorum de Paris from 1959 to 1980 and from 1978 to 1980 at the Conservatoire de Paris in the advanced training cycle as an assistant to Ventsislav Yankov, where she had her daughter Nathalie as a student. In 1970, she revived the Conservatoire Hortense Parent, rue de Tournon in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and in 1980, having left the Schola, she developed the Conservatoire by opening numerous classes in instruments and solfeggio. There will be over 170 students per year. Tagrine shared her career as a concert performer and teacher for several years, training numerous concert performers and teachers, including Laurent Grynszpan - composer and professor -,Laurent Grynszpan François Kerdoncuff, Annie Devize-Nalezny, Jean-Pierre Bartoli,Jean-Pierre Bartoli on Iremus Sylvie Lechevalier,Sylvie Lechevalier on Ticketac Emmanuelle Bartoli, Gisèle Magnan, Philippe Tamborini, Maud GarbariniMaud Garbarini on Linkedin Irène Kudela,Irène Kudela on Le Figaro Stéphane Fuks, Véronique Bonnecaze, and of course her daughter Nathalie Béra-Tagrine.

In 1984, she was appointed vice-president of the \\"Guilde française des Artistes solistes\\". Until the end of her life, at 85, she will play 2 pianos or 4 hands with her daughter, transmit her knowledge and share her passion for music with her students, always teaching with dynamism and joy.

A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.

Media freedom  Media freedom is the freedom to participate in media, the rights of expression, and access to and production of media content. These are all issues that can be fully understood only by considering their gender equality dimensions as they often overlap, and they have been compounded by the growing complexity of the digital sphere. Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men. In many newsrooms around the world, there continues to be a culture that makes it difficult for women to progress. In such workplaces, harassment is common, and a lack of monitoring means that even with gender equality policies in place, they are often ineffective in challenging gender discrimination. = Under- representation of women = A related challenge has been the absence of women's voices as an issue in media freedom, including in internet governance policy-making more generally. This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.Gender Dynamic Coalition and APC. 2016. Internet Governance Forum 2015: Learnings from the Gender Report Cards. GenderIT. Available at http://www.genderit.org/resources/internetgovernance- forum-2015-learnings-genderreport-cards. In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), senior leadership positions remain largely dominated by men. In 2017, ICANN's board of directors consisted of four women and 16 men. Minimizing the divide between the number of women and men in senior decision-making roles in relation to internet governance is an important step to ensuring that gender-based issues relating to access, privacy and security are prioritized.Kovacs, Anja, Avri Doria, Bruno Zilli, Margarita Salas, and Women's Legal and Human Rights Bureau. 2012. Critically Absent: Women’s Rights in Internet Governance. Available at <http://www.genderit.org/ resources/critically-absent-womeninternet- governance-policy-advocacytoolkit>. In the face of prevailing inequality, civil society continues to be a force for progress. Other organizations are working to push for greater representation and key standard-setting bodies, such as the Gender and Internet Governance Exchange, initiated by the Association for Progressive Communications, which aims to redress the gap in participation by women's and sexual rights’ activists in internet governance policy processes. In 2017, The Coalition For Women In Journalism developed a mentorship program for mid-career journalist to ensure that women journalists do not opt out of their profession because of stress, sexism in the newsroom, pay gap, and other such problems.https://pressroom.rferl.org/a/coalition-for- women-in-journalism/29206238.html = Freedom of information = Women's freedom of information and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as illiteracy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as sexual health. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.Kovacs, Anja. 2017. ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India. Internet Democracy Project. Available at <https://genderingsurveillance. internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/>. A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity.York, Jillian C. 2016. The State of Free Expression Online in Southeast Asia. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Available at . Accessed 4 July 2017. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.Hunt, Elle. 2017. LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible. The Guardian. Available at <https://www.theguardian.com/ technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt- communityanger-over-youtube-restrictions-whichmake-their-videos-invisible>. = Online activity = Gendered aspects of media freedom intersect heavily with journalists’ safety. Women journalists face unique concerns, such as personal safety when dealing with confidential sources, which can restrict their freedom of expression and add challenges that can hamper their ability to carry. Another dimension is the manifestation of physical violence as virtual violence through the increased incidence of hate speech and abuse directed towards women and the LGBTQI community. Such abuse has had a chilling effect and disrupted the online participation of these communities. Countering the proliferation of such abuse has proved a serious challenge for policy- makers wanting to minimize the harm directed towards vulnerable groups. To mark International Women's Day in 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted the challenges for governments, corporate bodies and civil society organizations to address such abuses while remaining attentive to international human rights law. He counseled against censorship and undue restrictions on freedom of expression as a means of curbing online abuse, warning that such restrictions could ‘end up undermining the rights of the very women for whom governments and corporate actors may seek to provide redress’.OHCHR. 2017. UN experts urge States and companies to address online genderbased abuse but warn against censorship  Media pluralism  Media pluralism is evaluated in terms of access, plurality of economic models and diversity of content. Gender equality in decision-making roles, the media workforce and representation in the media has not yet been reached in any of these areas according to UNESCO's World Trends Report. = Background = In the mid-1970s, pioneering academics made the first systematic analysis of women's relationship to and visibility in the mass media and in their ground- breaking study, they used the term ‘symbolic annihilation’ (originally credited to George Gerbner) to describe what they found.Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Available at . Accessed 25 May 2017. Almost 40 years later, most gender and media scholars would suggest that progress has stalled, and there is significant work left to be done, including in relation to mainstream media. Women still feature less frequently than men in news discourse; women journalists and media professionals are often locked out of the more prestigious beats, and their occupation of senior positions within media organizations is still minimal. According to the Global Media Monitoring Report in 2015 women made up only one in four media decision-makers, one in three reporters and one in five experts interviewed. Women's visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News?

The opportunities afforded to ‘ordinary’ citizens by the creation of alternative online news platforms has meant, however, that women's voices and perspectives are finding expression via these informal media channels. = International recognition = The existence of problems regarding gender and media pluralism has also been recognized by regional and international organizations and agencies over several decades. In 2010, UNESCO developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and- information/resources/publications-and-communication- materials/publications/full-list/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media- framework-of-indicators-to-gauge-gender-sensitivity-in-media-operations-and- content/ In 2013, the Council of the European Parliament adopted the recommendation made by the European Institute for Gender Equality, that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0074+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN During the 60th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2016, United Nations (UN) Women launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which aims to eradicate all forms of inequality.https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development- goals/ In 2015, UN Women launched ‘Step it Up for Gender Equality’, which had the tagline of ‘Planet 50:50 by 2030’. At the launch of that initiative, 70 nations committed to the gender equality agenda, and two years later, that number had increased to 93. In 2016, a review by UN Women of actions taken by these pledging nations reported a large number of initiatives, although none of them explicitly mentioned the media. Yet despite these initiatives, women remain excluded or marginalized in the media on the one hand, or else stereotyped and trivialized on the other. Longitudinal studies of women and news predict that this is unlikely to change soon. At the current pace of change, parity of visibility between women and men is unlikely to occur for another 40 years.Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015.

The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe and from diverse sectors who have committed themselves to focusing on gender equality in three main ways: in their reporting routines, by disrupting stereotypes and biases; by increasing the number of women in their organizations, including in leadership and decision-making roles; and in developing gender-sensitive corporate practices. At its launch, 39 media houses had already signed up as founding members of the Compact and although each will devise their own internal agenda, being a member of the Compact requires a minimum set of actions to be carried out.http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/media-compact = Gender equality in the media workforce = In many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programs and entering the industry.Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011.

Accessed 8 June 2017. In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of women media professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media workforce.National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). Women are encouraged not to go into ‘hard’ news beats and instead are channeled into areas of news that are allegedly of more ‘interest’ to women and are also commonly held as being less prestigious. A Monitoring Project (Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories. Stories about politics and crime see the fewest women reporters across all regions with the exception of Asia and Latin America. Unlike men, even when women do work on ‘hard’ news stories, they often struggle to achieve visibility for their copy: just over a third (37 per cent) of stories in newspapers, television and radio newscasts had a female by-line or were visibly or audibly reported by women, the same as in GMMP's 2005 study. More focused individual country analyses show exactly the same trends; for example, research from the United States shows that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of columnists at the major dailies.Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307. In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 Global Media Monitoring Project found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports Closer analysis from the World Trends report shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent) and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65. The Women's Media Center (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the United States shows a picture that has little changed from the GMMP's latest findings or indeed, from findings of its own previous studies. At 20 of the nation's top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.Women's Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at <http://www.womensmediacenter.com/ pages/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.media-2017>. Accessed 19 June 2017. In broadcast news, women's presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016. The WMC study found that these gender-based disparities existed across all news media as much in newspapers, online news, wire services as broadcast, but were especially stark in television news. The digital world is as likely to perpetuate the same gender divisions that exist in the off-line world as the opposite. There is little evidence to suggest that digital media are employing or promoting more women than other parts of the media ecology. The GMMP’s latest findings suggest that women's visibility as both citizens and media professionals in online news sites and Twitter feeds was 26 per cent, only two percentage points higher than for television, radio and print. The situation behind the scenes at large internet companies, which hold influence over which news content is presented most visibly and are responsible for moderation of discussion and comments, has been equally dire. = Women and decision-making = The challenge for many women is much more than just breaking into the industry, but also being able to advance to the highest levels in their careers. The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top management (27 per cent) and governance (26 per cent) positions.Byerly 2011. The largest recent study of women media professionals, this report, which was researched for the International Women's Media Foundation and supported by UNESCO, looked at 59 countries and 522 news outlets. The regions that fared best for women representation were Central (33 per cent) and Eastern Europe (43 per cent) and the Nordic countries (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in Asia and the Pacific region. A major European project funded by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) found very similar findings. Men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the European Union. Public sector organizations were more likely to recruit and promote women into senior positions than private sector media outlets.European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017.

Accessed 19 June 2017. The study also revealed that sexual harassment remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague. For Mary Kosut, women remain vastly underrepresented as media owners, a trend that has continued unabated as media concentration has increased through media consolidation and convergence.Kosut, Mary, ed. 2012. Encyclopedia of Gender in Media. SAGE Publications. = Gender and representation = Many feminist media scholars have argued that what we see in front of the camera is determined to some extent by who is behind the camera and there is some reason to believe that more women in the newsroom would produce news that is more diverse. Several studies, including the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), show that women journalists are more likely to source women in their stories than men, leading to more balanced reporting which is better able to reflect the views of more and diverse communities. The 2015 GMMP was able to make comparisons across the 20 years in which it has been operating. Despite women's considerable advancement over the past two decades in the public and private sectors, female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent). Where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of spokespersons and 19 per cent of experts featured in stories are women. The underrepresentation of women in media content extends across regions. Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in North America, followed by the Caribbean (29 per cent) and Latin America (27 per cent). In the southern African region, Gender Links’ latest Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women's views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media. According to Sarah Macharia, even if more women appear in media, there may be limited impact on the entrenched biases and stereotypes present in media content. This can promote narrow gender roles that limit the choices and options available to everyone. This is why many actors continue to encourage all media workers to become more gender-sensitive through training and internal policies that monitor coverage and promote greater awareness of gender issues. = The picture for women in media = Women's accomplishments in the media sector have long remained under-recognized by traditional professional and news organizations, a trend that remains unchanged. Women have won only a quarter of Pulitzer Prizes for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism.Asquith, Christina. 2016. Why Don't Female Journalists Win More Awards? – The Atlantic. The Atlantic. Available at . Accessed 25 June 2017. A number of organizations, mostly gender focused, have launched dedicated prizes to recognize achievements of women in media. The International Women's Media Foundation continues to recognize the courageous work of women journalists. In 2007, the Alliance of Women Film Journalists’ began giving out the EDA Awards annually to recognize women filmmakers and photojournalists. More recently, in 2015 the African Development Bank began sponsoring a category for Women's rights in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by One World Media.African Development Bank. 2015.

Media independence  Media independence is the capacity of a news outlet to provide accurate and unbiased information to the public. In a 2016 study of board members’ views in North America and Western Europe on the introduction of quotas, for example, individuals whose organizations (and countries) were committed to actions to increase women's representation were enthusiastic about the effects; but in contrast, individuals working in contexts without such commitments were rarely keen to embrace such strategies.Wiersema and Mors, 2016. In addressing issues around gender and media independence, a number of advocacy and media monitoring initiatives have developed over the past few years that provide data on persistent gender inequalities. Media unions at local, national, regional and global levels have been prominent in working to protect the interests of women media workers, initiating women's caucuses, appointing women's officers, establishing women's conferences and developing handbooks of good practice. International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), for example, has a Gender Council (GC) which co-ordinates its gender- focused work. Since its inception, the GC has been IFJ's main vehicle to guide projects; formulate policy concerning gender and good practice; and advocate for and mainstream gender-based issues throughout IFJ, its projects and its member unions. During its 2016 Congress, the work of the GC was officially enshrined and protected through inclusion in the IFJ Constitution. Women media professionals themselves have also been active in forming their own networks to support and encourage each other, organizing events, developing mentoring schemes and initiating awards that recognize women's accomplishments.International Federation of Journalists. 2017.

The International Women's Media Foundation’s 2011 global study of women in the news media, cited in the previous chapter, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions. More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries. The European Institute for Gender Equality’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place. Media houses with such policies in place typically lacked mechanisms to monitor their effectiveness, thereby limiting their potential to effect change. The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations. = Media monitoring and advocacy = In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms. The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote ‘gender equality in and through the media’ in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa. In 2016, the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured. The African Women's Development and Communication Network (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local capacity building initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to ICTs in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled ‘Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia’. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO's International Programme for the Development of Communication. In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its Arabic acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and civic participation. = Formal and informal professional associations = A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the Alliance for Women in Media (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.https://allwomeninmedia.org/ In 1975, it began its annual program of awards to recognize the work of program-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women's issues. A more regionally focused example is the Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the Arab world that aims to assist vulnerable local women journalists who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or psychological care.n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at <https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/>. Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the International Federation of Journalists found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women's representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women's union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications- reports/browse/weiter/category/reports/  Sources   References  Category:Mass media women Category:Women's studies ","title":"Women in media"},{"id":"57374183","text":"The Joint United States Military Advisory Group, Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI) is the U.S. Department of Defense's Security Assistance Organization in Thailand.

In 2010 he was arrested in New Zealand and charged with the attempted murder of his terminally-ill mother, Dr. Patricia Ferguson. As a result of his arrest and High Court trial, he became an international campaigner for changes to the law regarding assisted dying under legally-defined criteria. He is the founder and director of the pro-euthanasia organisation Dignity South Africa and president of the World Federation of Right-to-Die Societies. Both organisations support the decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia.  Early life and career  Born to an Irish father and British mother in Auckland, Sean Davison was raised in Hokitika,on the west coast of New Zealand. He obtained a PhD in microbiology from the University of Otago (New Zealand) in 1990. Following the completion of his PhD studies, he moved to South Africa and became a citizen of that country. He carried out post-doctoral research studies at the University of Cape Town (1990–93), before accepting an academic post at the University of the Western Cape where he established a molecular virology and a DNA forensics laboratory. The DNA forensics lab had notable success in identifying the remains of anti-apartheid activists, who were buried in mass graves by the apartheid-era police. Davison's lab has also developed a DNA rape kit for identifying individual perpetrators in cases where there is more than one rapist. Davison’s research interests include cognitive neuroscience where he demonstrated that suicide can be considered a rational thought in certain circumstances. Davison co-founded and is director of the Innocence Project: South Africa, an organisation supporting the exoneration of prisoners incarcerated for crimes they did not commit, proven via the use of DNA testing of biological material from the historical crime scenes.  Personal life  Davison is married to Rayne Pan with whom he has had three children. In 2006 Davison's mother, Dr. Patricia Ferguson, was terminally ill with secondary cancer. Davison left South Africa and traveled to New Zealand to care for her during her final months. Rather than face a prolonged and painful death from cancer, his mother decided to go on a hunger strike to end her life by inanition. Davison was his mother's only caregiver when she wrote a living will, requesting that she not be forced to eat or take medication. After 35 days of not eating, Davison's mother was unable to move any part of her body and her skin began to decompose as her body was attempting to keep the vital organs functioning. As a result, she was experiencing the pain she went on a hunger strike to avoid. At this point, Davison's mother pleaded with him to help her to die, and he ultimately conceded by giving her a lethal dose of crushed morphine tablets mixed with water. Davison wrote a book describing the three months he spent with his mother, and at the request of the publisher, he removed the specifics of how he assisted his mother to die. However, an early manuscript that included Davison's participation, was sent to his publisher and siblings, and eventually found its way to the police and media in New Zealand. It was widely reported that his eldest sister was responsible for informing the police of Davison's actions. As a consequence, Davison was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of his mother in September 2010. Although Davison lived and worked in Cape Town, he was faced with waiting a year for his trial to commence in New Zealand. Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote to the New Zealand High Court, vouching for Davison's character and pleading with the court to allow Davison to return to his family in South Africa, until the date of his trial. The court agreed to this request, setting a legal precedent in New Zealand, due to the seriousness of the offence. In September 2011, the trial took place in Dunedin, New Zealand. Davison accepted a plea bargain agreement, pleading guilty to assisted suicide. Prior to the judge's ruling, Archbishop Desmond Tutu again wrote to Judge Christine French, pleading for a lenient sentence. She acknowledged that Archbishop Tutu's request impressed her considerably and the judge concluded that Davison's actions were driven by love and compassion. Thereafter Davison was sentenced to five months' home detention in New Zealand. Following his conviction he said he had no regrets in assisting his mother to die, he also said he hoped his trial would help bring about a law change on euthanasia. During Davison's time on home detention he received death threats, including a brick thrown through his house of detention. Davison arranged for the note that was attached to the brick to be sent to his DNA forensics laboratory in South Africa in an attempt to DNA profile the perpetrator who had handled it. It was later discovered that the court had unknowingly made his house arrest location available online to the public, and he was subsequently moved to a secret location. On returning to his home in South Africa, Davison said he believed doctors had been helping patients to die since the beginning of humanity. Several television documentaries were made about Davison’s story, including a feature length documentary that received critical acclaim. In September 2018 Davison was arrested in South Africa and charged with the murder of his quadriplegic friend Dr Anrich Burger in 2013. Davison told the court that he was not guilty of any crime. He was granted bail even though the prosecution indicated there would be further murder charges. Following Davion’s arrest Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed his support for him once again. Dr Anrich Burger was a quadriplegic as the result of a motor vehicle accident and had publicly stated that he was seeking an assisted suicide. Following Dr Burgers death, and media speculation of Davison’s involvement, Davison publicly admitted he assisted his friend’s suicide. He also declared that he would not be willing to assist in euthanasia again. In November 2018 Davison was charged with a second murder, that of Mr Justin Varian in 2015. Justin Varian was terminally ill with Motor Neuron Disease and had publicly stated his desire to end his life because of his unbearable suffering. At that time there was media speculation that Davison was involved in planning Varian's death. However, Davison denied any involvement in it, stating that “assisted suicide is a world I don’t want to be in”. In April 2019 Davison was charged with a third murder, that of Richard Holland who died in December of 2015. Davison again denied the charges and the case was moved to the Western Cape High Court. Richard Holland was a popular South African triathlete who represented his country on the 2007 World Championships. As a result of the spinal injuries from being knocked off his bicycle he developed Locked-in- Syndrome and was only able to move a thumb and one eyelid. Although in court Davison denied all three murder charges he faced, he never made any public comment, however his wife disclosed he had helped the three men to die out of compassion, and she described the stress it brought to him and their family. In June 2019 Davison entered a plea bargain with the court in South Africa and pleaded guilty to all three murder charges he faced, in exchange he was sentenced to three years’ house arrest at his home in Cape Town. It was stated in court that none of the families of the men Davison assisted wanted him to go to prison. Two of the families made public statements supporting Davison’s actions in helping their family member to die. The only reported comment Davison made following his acceptance of the plea bargain was to say: “My children want a father not a martyr”. Davison’s arrest and sentence generated considerable public discussion in South Africa which was generally supportive of what he had done, and his decision to plead guilty to murder to avoid the risk of a lengthy prison sentence.  Right-to-die campaign  in 2012 Davison founded the organisation DignitySA, which seeks a law change to allow for voluntary euthanasia for those suffering near the end of their lives. In April 2015, DignitySA succeeded in taking the plea for an assisted death from a terminally-ill man, Robin Stransham-Ford, to the High Court. In an immediate action, Judge Fabricious granted Stransham-Ford an assisted death via lethal injection by a doctor. Although Stransham-Ford died of natural causes on same day of the High Court decision was made and did not receive a physician- assisted death, the court ruling set a legal precedent in South Africa. The Stransham-Ford High Court ruling was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal in December 2016. At this writing, April 2018, DignitySA is the plaintiff in a new court action in South Africa, representing all terminally-ill people in the country. At the World Federation of Right-to-Die Societies bi-annual conference in Chicago 2014, Davison was elected to the board of this organisation, and two years later became president at its conference in Amsterdam. He was re-elected president in 2018 at the bi-annual conference in Cape Town. He now plays an active role in the campaigns around the world. Davison has been closely associated with Archbishop Tutu's stated position on supporting assisted dying, and on expressing his own wish to have an assisted death if necessary.  Books  Davison's first book Before We Say Goodbye, describes the three months he spent with his mother prior to her death. This book was censored by the publisher Cape Catley Books to remove any chance of it leading to his arrest for helping his mother to die. However, following a meeting with American publisher and author Elaine Feuer at the World Federation of Right-to-Die Societies conference in Chicago in 2014, he was convinced of the importance of telling his story uncensored and bringing it up-to-date with the events that occurred after the first book's publication. In 2015, Elaine Feuer subsequently published his second book The Last Waltz: Love, Death & Betrayal, which included his court trial and was widely acclaimed with outstanding reviews and book sales. The Last Waltz became part of a set of three books, including Elaine Feuer's To Gently Leave This Life: The Right to Die and Traveling In and Out of Heaven. These books have been used extensively to assist the right-to-die organisations in the United States.

The house is the oldest building on the University campus, and is one the original four houses constructed for faculty when the University moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History University of Michigan (1855) by Jasper Francis Cropsey, showing the campus in 1847 with two of the faculty houses shown on the left. In 1840, the University of Michigan moved from its original location in Detroit to Ann Arbor. To house faculty members, four houses were constructed by builder Harpin Lum, costing a total of $26,900 (equivalent to $ in ). The houses may have been designed by campus architect Alexander J. Davis, but there is no record of the actual architect. Until 1852, the university was governed by a faculty committee, and there was no president. In 1852 Henry Philip Tappan became the first President of the University and moved into this house, which was at the time vacant. Tappan was succeeded in 1863 by Erastus Otis Haven, who added a single-story kitchen to the house, as well as a third story. Haven was succeeded in 1871 by James Burrill Angell, who had made his acceptance of the post conditional on refurbishment of the President's House. During Angell's tenure, the President's House was substantially altered by adding a west wing containing a semi-circular library and more bedrooms. Angell's successor, Harry Burns Hutchins, chose not to live in the house, and it remained vacant during Hutchins's tenure. When Marion LeRoy Burton was appointed in 1920, the President's House was thoroughly renovated at his request, adding a sun parlor with a sleeping porch and enclosing a rear porch to make a dining area. Subsequent presidents did some renovation work on the interior, but exterior changes were confined to the addition of a small study and glassed-in plant room during Alexander Grant Ruthven's tenure, and a glassed-in porch and stone terrace during Harlan Hatcher's tenure. In 1970, what is now the Hatcher Graduate Library was constructed behind the house. The house was extensively renovated in the late 1980s. Description The President's House is a three-story Italianate structure, with numerous wing additions to the original central mass. It is constructed of bricks covered with stucco, the stucco being marked to resemble mortar courses. The house is topped with a truncated hipped roof supported by double brackets, and a balustrade in the center. The main entrance is through a small porch with Doric columns. The house currently has 22 rooms.

Its planar embedding has three hexagonal faces (including the one shown as the external face of the illustration) and twelve pentagonal faces. As a planar graph with only pentagonal and hexagonal faces, meeting in three faces per vertex, this graph is a fullerene. The existence of this fullerene has been known since at least 1968.. See line 19 of table, p. 411, completely characterizing which numbers of hexagons are possible in a fullerene. Properties The 26-fullerene graph has D_{3h} prismatic symmetry, the same group of symmetries as the triangular prism. This symmetry group has 12 elements; it has six symmetries that arbitrarily permute the three hexagonal faces of the graph and preserve the orientation of its planar embedding, and another six orientation-reversing symmetries. The number of fullerenes with a given even number of vertices grows quickly in the number of vertices; 26 is the largest number of vertices for which the fullerene structure is unique. The only two smaller fullerenes are the graph of the regular dodecahedron (a fullerene with 20 vertices) and the graph of the truncated hexagonal trapezohedron (a 24-vertex fullerene), which are the two types of cells in the Weaire–Phelan structure. The 26-fullerene graph has many perfect matchings. One must remove at least five edges from the graph in order to obtain a subgraph that has exactly one perfect matching. This is a unique property of this graph among fullerenes in the sense that, for every other number of vertices of a fullerene, there exists at least one fullerene from which one can remove four edges to obtain a subgraph with a unique perfect matching. The vertices of the 26-fullerene graph can be labeled with sequences of 12 bits, in such a way that distance in the graph equals half of the Hamming distance between these bitvectors. This can also be interpreted as an isometric embedding from the graph into a 12-dimensional taxicab geometry. The 26-fullerene graph is one of only five fullerenes with such an embedding.. For the embedding, see Figure 5.3, p. 52. In popular culture In 2009, The New York Times published a puzzle involving Hamiltonian paths in this graph, taking advantage of the correspondence between its 26 vertices and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

Ahern was born in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia on 19 October 1877. Her father, Edmund Ahern, was a gold miner, and her mother was Eliza, née Kiely; both were from Ireland. Ahern left school when she was 14 years old, and worked as a pupil-teacher and then moved to Melbourne, where she worked in domestic service as a cook. Ahern joined the Abbotsford branch of the Political Labor Council in 1904, and the Social Questions Committee, later renamed the Victorian Socialist Party, the following year. The Victorian Socialist Party was primarily interested in education and free speech and ran weekly meetings in the Bijou Theatre that often attracted crowds of more than 1,000 people. It also held meetings at Yarra Bank, which could attract tens of thousands. Ahern was one of the Party's most popular and effective speakers and spoke at their meetings on street corners as well as in rural areas. In November 1906 she was arrested and jailed for ten days; she had been campaigning for the Free Speech Campaign, which defended the right to speak in public places. Ahern was a member of the Victorian Socialist Party's executive committee in 1906-08, 1910 and 1917-18; in 1906-07 she was a vice-president. She was a delegate to the Political Labor Council's annual conference in 1907 and helped to establish the Domestic Workers' Union and the Women's Socialist League. During World War I she campaigned against conscription and in 1916 she became secretary of the Women's Anti-Conscription Committee. Ahern remained active with the Labor Women's Central Organizing Committee until 1934, and was a delegate to the first interstate conference of Labor women in 1929 and secretary to its executive in 1930. She became a Justice of the Peace and a children's court magistrate. Ahern was a member of the party's Albert Park branch until she died on 7 April 1969. Personal life Ahern married Arthur Wallace of the Barrier Socialist Propaganda Group in a socialist wedding on 10 December 1908. They had two children together.

He also attended Monash University, Australia and obtained his MA and Ph. D. in political science. As a lecturer in political science at UI he pioneered since 1968 when he was a student, and resumed after studying in Australia and continued to serve the University of Indonesia until finally given the title of Professor in political science in 1993.  Corruption Case  Although the 2004 general election is considered to be successful internationally, its members, are dragged into corruption cases, one of which involved Nazaruddin Sjamsuddin. On May 20, 2005, Nazaruddin was suspected in the alleged corruption case at the KPU by the Corruption Court. He was charged and arrested, in addition to paying a fine of Rp450million, and replace state funds amounting to Rp 14.193 billion. On December 14, 2005 the Corruption Crime Court then sentenced him to seven years imprisonment on December 14, 2005.

In addition to his many published concert works, he is also one of the US's premier TV, theatre and media composers and musical arrangers with over 600 episodes of various series and short films to his credit. Lee is perhaps best known for writing the theme song of the animated TV series Little Bear, Pablo the Little Red Fox, 64 Zoo Lane and for his orchestration of Sir Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake which is currently the most performed dance production in the world. Early life Lee was born in Woking, Surrey to parents Brian and Dilys Lee (née Lucas). He attended Sheerwater Secondary School then transferred to Woking Boys Grammar School and Woking VI Form College. From 1978-1982 Lee was organist and choirmaster of Christ Church, Woking. From 1979-1984 Lee attended The Royal College of Music studying music composition (under the tutelage of Joseph Horovitz and Philip Cannon), piano and conducting. In 1982 Lee was elected president of the Royal College’s Student Association in the College's centenary year. He graduated with Honours in 1984. Career Prior to graduation from the Royal College of Music, Lee was approached by the Royal College of Art to compose soundtracks for two films by then animation student, Janet Simmonds. The short films entitled: The Waterfall and Merlin, taken together, won Lee the 1986 British Film Institute's Anthony Asquith Young Composer Award. This marked the reinstitution of this prize which has been awarded every year since. Subsequently, this led to Lee's writing extensively for animation films and TV soundtracks. In addition to his work in animation, Lee has composed and arranged for Ballet, Musical Theatre and both secular and religious concert music.

History Heusenstamm station was opened on 1 December 1898 as a single-track Haltepunkt (halt) along with the Offenbach-Bieber–Dietzenbach railway, which branches off the Rodgau Railway (Rodgaubahn) in Offenbach-Bieber. Trains ran on this line between Dietzenbach (Hess) station and Offenbach Hauptbahnhof. Passenger services on the line were discontinued on 18 June 1982, because traffic on it had been significantly affected by increasing car ownership. The station had a ticket office until then. The line was then used only for a small amount of freight traffic and the rail passenger services were replaced by buses. Services on line S2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn commenced at the 2003/2004 timetable change on 14 December 2003. In the course of the development of the line for the S-Bahn, the track layout at the station was altered and the line was double-tracked and electrified. The station was rebuilt from 2001 to 2003 with two side platforms for S-Bahn operations that are barrier-free for the disabled. Previously the station had a main platform next to the entrance building and an island platform.  Entrance building The entrance building from 1898 is listed as a cultural monument under the Hessian monument protection law. The two-storey brick building has been privately owned since 2006 and is now used by the Alter Bahnhof restaurant.  Operations Today, the station is served exclusively by services on S-Bahn line S2. These run to Niedernhausen via Offenbach, Frankfurt and Hofheim. In the opposite direction, the S2 runs to Dietzenbach station. The S-Bahn trains run on a basic cycle of 30 minutes. During the peak, services run every 15 minutes. = Bus services= Heusenstamm station is served by OF-30, OF-96 and X19 operated by BRH ViaBus GmbH.

The term maladjustment can be refer to a wide range of social, biological and psychological conditions. Maladjustment can be both intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic maladjustment is the disparities between the needs, motivations and evaluations of an individual, with the actual reward gain through experiences. Extrinsic maladjustment on the other hand, is referred to when an individual's behavior does not meet the cultural or social expectation of society. The causes of maladjustment can be attributed to a wide variety of factors, including: family environment, personal factors, and school-related factors. Maladjustment affects an individual's development and the ability to maintain a positive interpersonal relationship with others. Often maladjustment emerges during early stages of childhood, when a child is in the process of learning methods to solve problem that occurs in interpersonal relationship in their social network. A lack of intervention for individuals who are maladjusted can cause negative effects later on in life.  Causes  Children who are brought up in certain conditions are more prone to maladjustment. There are three main causes associated to maladjustment: = Family causes = Socially, children that comes from broken homes often are maladjusted. Feelings of frustration toward their situation stems from insecurities, and denial of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter. Children whose parents are unemployed or possess a low socioeconomic status are more prone to maladjustment. Parents who are abusive and highly authoritative can cause harmful effect towards psychological need which are essential for a child to be socially well adjusted. The bond between a parent and child can affect psychological development in adolescent. Conflicts between parent and child relationship can cause adolescents to have poor adjustment. The level of conflict which occur between a parent and child can affect both the child's perception of the relationship with their parents and a child's self-perception. The perception of conflict between parent and child can be attributed to two mechanisms: reciprocal filial belief and perceived threats. Reciprocal filial belief refers to the love, care and affection that a child experience through their parent, it represents the amount of intimacy a child has with his or her parent. High levels of perceived conflict between parent and child reduces feelings of empathy, a child may feel isolated and therefore alienate themselves from their parent, this reduces the amount of reciprocal filial belief. Adolescent with lower levels of reciprocal filial belief are known to shown characteristic of a maladjusted individual. Perceived threats can be characterized as the anticipation of damage or harm to oneself during an emotional arousing event that induce a response towards stress. Worry, fear and the inability to cope with stress during conflicts are indicators of a rise in the level of perceived threat in a parent and child relationship. Higher levels of perceived threats in a parent a child relationship may exacerbate negative self-perception and weaken the ability to cope, this intensifies antisocial behavior which is a characteristic associated with maladjustment. = Personal causes = Children with physical, emotional or mental problems often have a hard time keeping up socially when compared to their peers. This can cause a child to experience feeling of isolation and limits interaction which brings about maladjustment. Emotion regulation plays a role in maladjustment. Typically, emotions are generally adaptive responses which allow an individual to have the flexibility to change their emotion based on the demand of their environment. Emotional inertia refers to \\"the degree in which emotional states are resistant to change\\"; there is a lack of emotional responsiveness due to the resistance of external environmental changes or internal psychological influences. High level of emotional inertia may be indicative of maladjustment, as an individual does not display a typical variability of emotions towards their social surroundings. A high level of emotional inertia may also represent impairment in emotional- regulation skill, which is known to be indicators or low self-esteem and neuroticism. = School related causes = Children who are victimized by their peers at school are more at risk of being maladjusted. Children who are victimized by their peer at school are prone to anxiety and feelings of insecurity. This affect their attitudes towards school, victimized children are more likely to show dislike towards schools and display high levels of school avoidance. Teachers who display unfair and biased attitudes towards children cause difficulties in their adjustment towards the classroom and school-life. Unhealthy and negative peer influence, such as delinquency, can cause children to be maladjusted in their social environment.  Associated characteristics  There are some characteristics that are associated with maladjustments. *Nervous behavior. Habits and tics in response to nervousness (e.g. biting fingernails, fidgeting, banging of head, playing with hair, inability to stay still). *Emotional overreaction and deviation. The tendency to respond to a situation with unnecessarily excessive or extravagant emotions and actions (e.g. avoidance of responsibility due to fear, withdrawal, easily distracted from slightest annoyance, unwarranted anxiety from small mistakes). *Emotional immaturity. The inability to fully control one's emotion (e.g. indecisiveness, over dependence on other, excessively self-conscious and suspicious, being incapable to work independently, hyperactivity, unreasonable fears and worries, high levels of anxiety). *Exhibitionist behavior. Behaviors conducted in attempts to gain attention or to portray a positive image (e.g. blame others for one's own failure, high level of overt agreeableness towards authority, physically hurting others). *Antisocial behavior. Behaviors and acts that showed hostility or aggression to others (e.g. cruelty to others, the use of obscene and abusive language, bullying others, destructive and irresponsible behaviors) *Psychosomatic disturbances. This can include: complications in bowel movement, nausea and vomiting, overeating, and other pains.  Negative effects  = Poor academic performance = Maladjustments can have an effect on an individual's academic performance. Individual who are maladjusted behaviors tend to have a lower commitment to scholastic achievements, which cause poorer test results, higher rate of truancy and increase risk of dropping out of school. = Suicidal behavior = In cases where a child suffers from physical or sexual abuse, maladjustment is a risk for suicidal behavior. Individual with a history of childhood abuse tend to be maladjusted due to their dissatisfaction in social support and the prevalence of an anxious attachment style. Clinical implication suggests that by targeting maladjustment in individuals with history of childhood abuse, the risk of suicidal behavior may be attenuated.

Yunmen Temple is the cradle of Yunmen school, which is one of the five schools of Chan Buddhism. It was first built in the Tang dynasty (618-907), and went through many changes and repairs through the following dynasties. Most of the present structures in the temple were repaired or built between 1943 and 1951. History The Hall of Four Heavenly Kings. =Tang dynasty= This temple was first built by an accomplished monk Chan master Yunmen Wenyan in 923 during the late Tang dynasty (618-907). After the fall of the Tang dynasty, Yunmen Temple declined and was incredibly disappeared during the Republic of China. =Republic of China= In 1943, master Hsu Yun came to Yunmen Temple to promulgate Buddhist doctrines. Under his leadership, more than 300 buildings and halls and 100 statues of Buddha were added to the temple. Renovations and rebuilding to the temple began in 1943 and was completed in 1951. =People's Republic of China= After the establishment of the Communist State, Foyuan (), a disciple of Hsu Yun, succeeded the position of abbot. In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, Yunmen Temple was badly damaged in this ten-year movement. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, regular scripture lectures, meditation and other features of temple life were resumed in 1983. That same year, Yunmen Temple was designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China. Architecture The extant structure is based on the Qing dynasty building principles and retains the traditional architectural style. The complex include the following halls: Shanmen, Mahavira Hall, Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, Hall of Sangharama Palace, Bell tower, Drum tower, Hall of Guru, Dharma Hall, Memorial Hall of Hsu Yun, Dining Room, etc. References Category:Buddhist temples in Shaoguan Category:Buildings and structures in Shaoguan Category:Tourist attractions in Shaoguan Category:1951 establishments in China Category:20th-century Buddhist temples Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1951 ","title":"Yunmen Temple (Guangdong)"},{"id":"57374853","text":"Appendicula elegans is a species of orchids.

Unlike other colors, white colour is not induced by pigments. Several white plant tissues are principally equipped with the complete machinery for anthocyanin biosynthesis including the expression of regulatory genes. Nevertheless, they are unable to accumulate red or blue pigments, for example Dahlia ´Seattle´ petals showing a white tip. Several studies have revealed a further reduction of the anthocyanidin to colorless epicatechin by the enzyme anthocyanidin reductase (ANR). Cultivation & Modification of Colour Many external factors can influence colour: light, temperature, pH, sugars and metals. There is a method to turn petunia flowers from white to transparent. The petunia flower is immersed into a flask of water, connected to a vacuum pump, after which the flower appeared colourless. The white colour is expressed by the air present in the vacuoles that absorb the light, without air the flower loses the white colour. There is an increasing interest in flower colour, since some colorations are currently unavailable in plants. Ornamental companies create new flower colour by classical and mutation breeding and biotechnological approaches. For example, white bracts in Poinsettia are obtained by high frequency irradiation.

She is remembered today as the librettist of Rossini's first opera Demetrio e Polibio. Her husband was the tenor Domenico Mombelli. Life and career Viganò-Mombelli was born in Naples to an artistic family. Both her father Onorato Viganò (1739-1811) and her brother Salvatore Viganò were prominent dancers and choreographers. Her mother Maria Ester Boccherini was a ballerina and the sister of composer Luigi Boccherini. In 1791 Vincenza was dancing with Onorato Viganò's company in Venice when she met the recently widowed tenor Domenico Mombelli. They married that same year and went on to have twelve children, three of whom became prominent opera singers: Ester born 1792, Anna born 1795, and Alessandro born 1796 (a tenor like his father). She continued her dancing career for some time after her marriage, appearing in the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice only a few months before the birth of her fourth child in 1798. Although primarily based in Bologna by 1805, the Mombelli family also travelled from 1806 to 1811 to Lisbon and various theatres in Italy with their own opera company which included their daughters Ester and Anna and the bass Lodovico Olivieri. According to an account in Stendhal's Vie de Rossini, Olivieri was an old friend of Vincenza who not only sang \\"utility roles\\" in their company but also served as the family's cook and major domo. It was in Bologna that Vincenza and Domenico made the acquaintance of the young Rossini who was still a student at the Accademia Filarmonica. Vincenza wrote the libretto for Rossini's first opera Demetrio e Polibio. It was premiered privately in 1809 and had its official premiere on 18 May 1812 at Rome's Teatro Valle with three of its four roles sung by Domenico and their daughters Ester and Anna. Vincenza Viganò-Mombelli died in 1814. Domenico Mombelli married for a third time in 1819.

Design The hybrid electric has a 200-hp gasoline generator giving up to range over 1 hour. It has four propeller arms, each with two electric contra-rotating propellers powered by a gas turbine or piston engine generator along with a battery pack. Targeting a price of $200,000, it can lift a payload and includes a ballistic parachute. The SureFly would operate as a conventional helicopter, like the similarly priced two-seat Robinson R22, but would be easier to fly and safer with its integral parachute. SureFly has taken refundable $1,000 deposits but does not specify a delivery date, and aims to produce 1,000 per year. The hybrid design is simpler than a pure gasoline drivetrain by eliminating the gearboxes and rotor linkages of a traditional helicopter, while security is higher through two redundant motors. Each propeller blade is driven directly by an independent electric motor and flight control is achieved by varying the RPM of each blade to achieve thrust vectoring and prevailing torque changes across the vehicle, similar to smaller multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles. It was later upgraded with a 200-kW generator, a payload capability and up to range over 2 hours. Development Prototype on ground with doors open in Summer 2018 After hundreds of tethered flights testing noise, battery and flight controls, it made a free first flight in spring 2018, reaching four feet during 10 seconds. Flight tests will expand the flight envelope while FAA type certification advances. Workhorse intends to spin off SureFly into a separate company, valuing it $33 million. Workhorse should begin delivering SureFly delivery drones by 2020. FAA type certification was applied for in fall 2018. In October 2018, Workhorse put SureFly for sale and its latest backer, Marathon Asset Management, requires a $4 million liquidity for May 31, 2019. In December 2019, flight controls specialist Moog Inc. bought the SureFly program for $5 million, interested by the electric power systems more than the aircraft, and will use it as an autonomous demonstrator.

It is a member of the World Council of Churches and the Polish Ecumenical Council. It is not affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Wiktor Wysoczański was chosen as the church's superior in 1995. History Bishop Superior Wiktor Wysoczański Santa Spirit (Central) Cathedral in Warsaw St. Mary Magdalene Cathedral in Wrocław Czestochowa The Polish-Catholic Church, known within Poland until 1951 as the Polski Narodowy Kościół Katolicki (PNKK), has its origins in the final decade of 19th century. During this time, Polish immigrants in the United States, referred to as Polonia, participated in the protests of lay people in Roman Catholic parishes against the domination of clergy from German and Irish origins. The parishioners demanded insight into the financial matters of parishes, the use of vernacular in liturgy, and the appropriate care and treatment of clergy from their own ethnic group. After the unsuccessful presentation of their requests to the Vatican in 1897, the Polish National Catholic Church was formally founded in Scranton, Pennsylvania, out of a number of independent Polish parishes. After the consecration of the Reverend Franciszek Hodur as a bishop in 1907, the newly organized church community became a member of the Union of Utrecht of Old Catholic Churches. After realizing the necessity of establishing and maintaining contact with Poland, Bishop Hodur worked to establish the PNCC in that country. According to the religious and social precepts of the PNCC, there was an obligation to serve their country of origin, Poland. They especially sought the independence of their native land. The church worked to maintain this tradition among Polish immigrants, along with defending Polish national interests. Independence in Poland was gained in 1918, although the missionary work of the church was impeded due to lack of legalization. The efforts of the church for legal recognition were unsuccessful until 1939. It was not until February 1946 that the church gained legal status on the basis of the decision of Polish Ministry of Public Administration. After 1945, Polish Communist authorities were not supportive of legalising the Polish National Catholic Church because its leader, Bishop Hodur, was a United States citizen. In 1951, under pressure from the Communist regime, the Polish diocese of the original Polish National Catholic Church declared itself independent of its parent church in the United States. This was partially due to the arrests of Bishop Joseph Padewski and Father Edward Narbutt-Narbuttowicz. In the autumn of 1951, the church changed its name to the Polish Catholic Church. The new leader of the church was Father Józef Dobrochowski who, in close cooperation with Father Eugeniusz Krieglewicz, followed the orders of the Communist authorities. The Polish government now had complete control over the church in that state authorities appointed and removed bishops, managed church personnel and financed church operations. The duties of the new church included organizing Masses for the celebration of the anniversary of the 1952 Polish Constitution which occurred on July 22, a Communist holiday not supported by the Roman Catholic Church, and sending letters of congratulation to the authorities concerning other anniversaries. Full regulation of the church’s legal status occurred after the Polish Parliament, on June 30, 1995, passed the Bill on Mutual Relations Between the State and Polish Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland (Dz. U. Nr 97, poz. 482). On May 26, 2000, the Polish Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church of Poland agreed upon mutual respect and cooperation. Theology According to the church law which is currently in force, the Polish Catholic Church professes Catholic faith, morality and principles as set forth in the Bible, formulated in common symbols of faith and decisions of the First seven Ecumenical Councils. The Polish Catholic Church has many similarities to the Roman Catholic liturgy in that it expresses Trinitarian doctrine, Marian devotion and reverence for the saints. The church also employs the traditional Catholic liturgical calendar. The central point of spiritual life within the church is the Eucharist, which is understood as the re-presentation of the redeeming sacrifice of Christ. The church also pays reverence to the angels, apostles, martyrs and saints, keeping among them a special place for the Virgin Mary. According to the church, a sin is an intentional and voluntary breaking of God’s or the church’s commandments. The seven deadly sins are pride, envy, lust, anger, greed, sloth, and gluttony. Penitents gain the absolution of sins by participating in the sacrament confession, where sins are confessed in the presence of a priest in order to gain absolution. The conditions of a good confession are: # Examination of conscience # Repentance # Firm purpose of amendment # Sincere confession # Compensation to God and neighbours. There are two forms of confession exercised in Polish Catholic Church: individual and corporate. Individual confession takes place privately with a priest, while corporate confession is exercised as a separate public ceremony in front of the altar, or as a part of Mass during the Act of Penitence. Individual confession is obligatory for children and youth under the age of 18; it is also recommended for adults any time they feel the need to participate. It is believed that proper and frequent reception of the sacrament of confession will allow an individual to grow in the spiritual life. Clergy Polish Catholic Church Archdiocese administration maps In 2009 the Polish Catholic Church consisted of 80 parishes with 111 priests. A priest must be male, a graduate of the Christian Academy of Theology in Warsaw specialising in Old-Catholic Theology, and a graduate of the Higher Clerical Seminary of the Polish Catholic Church in Warsaw. Candidates also need approval from Church authorities. Clergy of the Polish Catholic Church are not bound to celibacy. All candidates for bishop must be episcopally consecrated by at least three bishops who are members of the International Conference of Old Catholic Bishops, known as the Utrecht Union. The presiding bishop of the church is selected by the national synod. =List of superiors= * 1951–1957 – Bishop College * 1957–1958 – Bishop Julian Pękala (1904–1977) * 1959–1965 – Bishop Maksymilian Rode (1911–1999) * 1965–1975 – Bishop Julian Pękala (1904–1977) * 1975–1994 – Bishop Tadeusz Majewski (1926–2002) * 1995–present - Bishop Wiktor Wysoczański (1939–present) References External links *Church official website (pl) *The Holy Spirit Polish-Catholic Cathedral in Warsaw (en) (pl) *Our Lady Zielna Polish- Catholic Church in Leszno (pl) *Our Lady Perpetual Help Polish-Catholic Church in Strzyżowice (pl) *John Baptist Polish-Catholic Church in Świeciechów (pl) *Heart of Jesus Polish-Catholic Church in Zamość (pl) *St.Jacob Polish- Catholic Church in Żółkiewka (pl) Category:Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches Category:Christian denominations in Poland Category:Independent Catholic denominations Poland Category:Members of the World Council of Churches Category:Christian organizations established in 1924 Category:Christian denominations established in the 20th century Category:1924 establishments in Poland Category:Catholicism in Poland ","title":"Polish-Catholic Church of Republic of Poland"},{"id":"57375094","text":"Douglas Churchill (born 7 November 1948) is an Australian judoka.

His father was of noble descent and had been elected in 1626 as a member of the council of nobles of the city of Crema, Lombardy where the family resided. His father died when Giovanni Battista Lucini was only six years old, presumably leaving the family in a precarious financial condition. There are no firm records on Lucini from this time until 1663, when he joined the city council and was living in his brother Carlo's house.Micaela Mander, Lucini, Giovan Battista, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 66 (2006) Christ calms the dragons Giovanni Battista Lucini is believed to have been a pupil of Giovanni Battista Botticchio. Botticchio worked in Crema and was one of the leading 17th century painters in Lombardy. There are no records, which support this apprenticeship but elements of Lucini's style in his early works show Botticchio's influence and make such relationship likely. Small-format works by artists then in vogue which were likely present in the collections of noble families in Crema are believed to have played a role in the formation of Lucini. After Botticchio's death in 1666, Lucini travelled and spent time in Genoa, Milan and Veneto. Lucini never married and had no children. He made a will on 18 February 1684. He died in Crema on the night between 14 and 15 September 1686. He was buried in the church of Saint Catherine of the Carmelites in Crema, a church that no longer exists.Matteo Patrini, Crema Breve guida pratica Lucini's pupils included his nephew who was also called Giovan Battista Lucini, Giambattista Marmoro and Giambattista Carello. Work Giovanni Battista Lucini was a canvas painter who created religious paintings for the religious institutions in the Crema region. In his early years the Genoese and Venetian influences which he had received during his travels are apparent. His first known dated work is the St Francis de Sales (likely 1665, Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore, Crema), which shows 'tenebrist' features as well as a great attention to perspective, in which he was reportedly particularly skilled. Evident in his early works are also the influence of his presumed master Botticchio, particularly in the use of chiaroscuro, which gives the figures in his compositions an almost sculptural aspect. The miracle of Torino His early masterpiece is the Liberation of Saint Peter painted in 1675 for the church of San Bernardino degli Osservanti in Crema. This work shows his adherence to the dark tonality of this tenebrist period together with a development towards a more realist approach in the intense expressions of the figures. This work established the artist's reputation and earned him many commissions from the churches in Crema. Over the years Lucini's work gained in liveliness and playfulness and became less dark. This evolution towards more colour is represented in two works depicting the biblical story of the Flight into Egypt, the Christ calms the dragons and Mary fed by the palm (both in the Parish Church of Ombriano). The works are characterised by their full-bodied and bright color and the solidity of the figures. In two works, one representing the Saints Pietro d'Alcántara and Bernardino da Feltre (San Bernardino Church, Crema) and the other the Miracle of San Pietro d'Alcantara (Museo civico di Crema e del Cremasco} Lucini abandoned all tenebrist tendencies in favor of the use of a homogeneous nucleus of light, which binds the whole picture together and defines the psychology of the figures. The calm and sober esthetic of the pictures has been linked to the spirituality and vows of poverty proper to the Dominican Order. The miracle of the stolen Host Between 1681 and 1684 Lucini painted some large paintings for the presbytery of the Cathedral of Crema on the subject of the Miracles of the Eucharist. These works anticipated the cycle of the Blessed Sacrament made in 1700 for the Cathedral of Milan by Filippo Abbiati. These works display an increased theatricality in the figures, which are rendered in nervous poses.

It has been suggested that parts of the park are identifiable from local name places, for example, Parkside, and Lower Parks. Parkside was a separate estate believed to border Mersley Park.  History  Originally, Mersley Park was under the jurisdiction of the Marford Commote whose seat of power was The Rofft, Marford. In 1282, merging of the commutes of Marford, Wrexham and Yale created the Marcher Lordship of Bromfield and Yale. Later documents record that Mersley Park came under the Lordship of Bromfield. Documented are some of the keepers of Mersley Park. Thomas Huxley (1397), Geoffry Legy (about 1506), and William Almer (about 1519). A Henry VIII letter, dated 2 August 1536, specifically mentioned the park, “Hugh David, a yeoman of the guard.

In the same year, Queen Elizabeth I leased the park to Sir Thomas Egerton, Master of the Rolls and his sons Thomas and John. In 1620, John Norden’s Survey, for Prince Charles, later Charles I, stated that Mersley Park was leased to the Earl of Bridgewater. It consisted of 616 acres and shown on a plan as square shaped. The park was accessible through four gateways, Broade Way, Wrexham Gate, Bellis Gate, and Probyn’s Gate. John Egerton, later Earl of Bridgewater, succeeded his father, Sir Thomas Egerton. The Earl of Bridgewater purchased the estate from the Crown, on 3 July 1630. The Earl of Bridgewater, was a Royalist during the English Civil War (1642-1651), and sold part of the Park to Sir Edward Spencer and Sir Bevis Thelwall.

La Roque-Gageac 1561 or 1562, d. La Roque-Gageac 1636) was Vicar general of Sarlat, famous for his chronicles of the diocese. He was a Frenchman and was an early adopter of Copernican theory. Tarde was born into a semi wealthy family in the bourgeois community in La Roque-Gageac, near Sarlat, France. He received his doctorate of law from the University of Cahors and then went on to the University of Paris to continue his studies. Throughout his younger adult life, he held a number of different religious positions such as canon theologian, and almoner where during his free time he studied various sciences including mathematics, astronomy, physics, and geography. He is most famous for his work with sunspots which he concluded were small satellites of the sun.  Biography  Jean Tarde belonged to an established family of Sarlat dating to a least the 14th century. The family had two branches, the du Ponts, to which Jean Tarde belonged, and the de Lisles. He studied at the university of Cahors and then at the Sorbonne, and was an expert in mathematical sciences. He became curate of Carves, near Belvès, before being appointed theological canon at the cathedral of Sarlat. He spent his leisure time on scientific studies, including mathematics, astronomy, physics and geography. His love of antiquities prompted him to travel extensively, particularly in southeastern France, where he visited the main Gallo-Roman sites. He was at Béziers and Marseille in 1591, at resided in Nîmes and Uzès in 1592, 1593, and 1594. In 1593 he also visited Orange and Avignon, where he was given permission to pursue his research in the pontifical archives, from where he set off in his first visit to Rome, and to where he returned. On this first visit, in 1593, he spent his time with the great antiquarian Fulvio Orsini. It was also on this visit that he made the acquaintance of one of the finest mathematicians of the day, Christoph Clavius. During the Wars of Religion the archives of the cathedral were destroyed, and Tarde was in charge of reconstituting them. In 1594 the bishop of Sarlat also commissioned him to prepare a map of the diocese, illustrating the damage caused by the wars. To undertake this task, he walked the diocese with a quadrant, a compass needle and a sundial to establish distances and angles. The chronicles he kept until 1630 probably date from this time as well. He also chronicled a journey to Rome that he undertook in 1593 on the bishop's instruction. In March 1599, Henri IV named him almoner in ordinary. In 1629, Tarde was made a member of the Conseil du Roi, a hereditary position retained by his family until the French Revolution. Jean Tarde considered sunspots to be tiny planets between Mercury and the sun. His religious beliefs prevented him from accepting that sunspots appeared on the Sun itself because the Sun was a sacred place chosen by God himself and it could not be corrupt. This theory was grounded in the biblical phrase \\"In sole posuit tabernaculum Suum\\" (‘[God] has pitched his tent in the sun’) which he referred to in his writing. The idea of the Sun being pure and sacred was based not only in the bible but in the philosophy of Aristotle.  Astronomy  = Discussions with Galileo Galilei = First learning of Galileo's work through Robert Balfour who knew him, Jean Tarde read Sidereus Nuncius and wanted to find out more. During his visit to Florence, Jean Tarde went to see Galileo in 1614, November 12. Tarde admired Galileo writing in his own diary after the encounter, \\"In the morning I went to see Master Galileo, famed philosopher and astronomer.... I told him that his fame had crossed the Alps, traversed France, and reached even to the ocean.\\" In their conversation, he talked with Galileo about several topics such as the \\"moons\\" (ring) of Saturn and phases of Venus. Galileo believed that the spots traveled the same path as Venus and Mercury taking 14 days to cross the middle of the earth. Galileo also felt that there was no parallax for the spots, meaning the spots had to be very close to or on the sun, not the earth. He knew his claims may have been hard to believe, so Galileo also told Tarde that others had seen the same spots he had seen, which in effect helped validate his sightings. Later in their conversation, Tarde asks Galileo how to make a telescope. Galileo claimed to now know how the scope worked, but he did reference Tarde to Kepler's book on optics. Galileo was supposed to send Tarde better lenses while Tarde was in Rome, however months went by and he still had not (this was known by Tarde's letters to Galileo). However Tarde and Galileo encountered each other a few times after their conversation and Galileo revealed more and more about what he had discovered with the telescope. Jean Tarde wrote about his meeting and discussion with Galileo in his diary. However, the section of the interview in which he had discussed sunspots with Galileo was crossed out. The reasons Jean Tarde did this is unknown and are a subject of debate among historians. Some historians have suggested that Jean Tarde learned that Galileo was not the first to discover sunspots as he had claimed at the time. Galileo and Tarde met up a few times after this. = Discussions with Christoph Grienberger = After meeting with Galileo in Florence, Jean Tarde went to back to Rome where he meet the Jesuit mathematician Christoph Grienberger. Jean Tarde learned several more things about sunspots from Christoph Grienberger. Among these Christoph Grienberger told Jean Tarde that numerous other astronomers in both Italy and Germany had been able to observe the sunspots. Christoph Grienberger explained that there were two main threads of thought about what sunspots were; he said that people either thought sunspots were small planets extremely close to the sun or some sort of phenomena in the sun's atmosphere. He also demonstrated four methods of observing sunspots to Jean Tarde. Diagram of Sunspots from Borbonia Sidera = Research at Sarlat = Jean Tarde returned to Sarlat in 1615 February and constructed a small observatory. It is unknown if the telescope he used the lens promised by Galileo. Jean Tarde made observations by casting a projection of the sun onto a white sheet inside his darkened observatory. Using this method he took long and detailed logs of sunspots and their movements. These records would be used several years later when writing his book. In 1615 August 25 Jean Tarde observed over 30 sunspots on the face of the sun at once. = \\"The Bourbon Planets\\" = Jean Tarde started writing his book on sunspots in 1619. He eventually published two versions of the book on the topic; Borbonia Sidera in Latin in 1620 and Astras de Borbon in French in 1622. The titles of these books mean \\"Bourbon Stars\\", dedicated to Louis XIII and the ruling family of France; likely in order to try and gain patronage, like many other scientists of the time. Diagram of how multiple planets can make the irregular shapes of sunspots from Borbonia Sidera In these books Jean Tarde lays out his observations and arguments about the nature of the recently discovered sunspots. Tarde refutes the theory that the spots were on the sun or in the sun's atmosphere by claiming this \\"violates the Aristotelian principle that the heavens were not subject to corruption.\\" The Peripatetics felt the claim was outrageous and offensive. Tarde says the spots are actually clouds and emissions from the Sun. Tarde argued that spots can not diminish the sun because the Sun is the father of light. He states, \\"It is the seat of God, His house, His tabernacle. It is impious to attribute to God's house the filth, corruption and blemishes of the Earth.\\" Tarde felt the sun was a perfect sphere and was flawless. Instead, Jean Tarde favored the view that sunspots were instead a series of small planets orbiting closely to the sun. In his book he laid out a series of twenty properties of the sunspots which he believed lead to the conclusion that sunspots were planets. Among the properties he cited were: * The number of sunspots and the frequency of their appearance were far to great to be transits of the other inner planets; Venus and Mercury. He even pointed out that an observation of Kepler's, \\"a little daub, quite black, approximately like a flea,\\" which Kepler thought was a transit of Mercury was actually a sunspot. He made similar claims about observations by Julius Caesar Scaliger. * He compared the darkness that the sunspots on the Sun were similar in darkness to that of the shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse. * Many people at the time held to the view that the seven planets known to the ancients; Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon, and the Sun. Jean Tarde asserted that this belief was wrong by discussing how several ancient cultures believed in an infinite number of worlds. Although he didn't actually believe there was an infinite number of worlds he did cite the recent discoveries of the Jupiter's Galilean moons and Saturn's two moons (actually rings). He also cited the vast number of new stars visible now through telescopes. * He asserted that sunspots could not be stars because were not luminous like other stars. * He argued against Galileo's proof that sunspots were not planets because of their irregular shape using several claims. Including, that the brightness of the sun made it impossible to get a clear picture of the sunspots' roundness, that current telescopes had issues with resolving dim and far away objects, and that the sunspots would be undergoing phases like the other inner planets. *He argued that apparent motion across the ecliptic was caused by the angle of viewing of the observer standing on the Earth * Galileo had argued that sunspots must have to be on the sun because they show no parallax. In response Tarde argued that they were either to close to the sun to get an accurate measurement or that the change in parallax was so slight that it would have to have constant monitoring. Thus even one cloudy day would prevent it's measurement. * One large problem which Galileo had posed to Tarde was that the Venus' orbit was quicker than Earth's and Mercury's faster than Venus' so why didn't the sunspots go faster? In response, Tarde argued that the variable speeds of the sunspots was part of how they could be identified. * He also thought that the sun was incorruptible. Through Tarde had many findings, it was not until years after he made discoveries that he published his work unlike the other philosophers of his time. Also though Tarde had put so much time and effort into his work, the recognition he wished to have gained from the king was not presented to him. He even abandoned the sunspots theory for a couple of years where he then returned to the conversation in Dialogue on the two world systems of 1632. In later years to come, several philospohers began to discuss Tarde's work. Some agreed with Tarde, some disagreed, but the discussion was still happening. However, once Tarde died, so did the conversation about sunspots. In the following years, some sightings of sunspots were found in 1640 and the conversation began again.

Biography  Lev Solomonovich Gutkin was born on 22 November 1914. In 1931 he graduated from Moscow Telephone Technical School. In 1932 he entered and in 1937 graduated to the Electrophysical Faculty of Moscow Power Engineering Institute, majoring in radio engineering. His thesis project was nominated for Academician Petrov Award. He continued his studies at the institute in the Department of Radio Receiving Devices in the development of radio compasses. In 1940, Gutkin defended his Candidate of Sciences thesis, which was dedicated to the issues of superregenerative radio reception. In July 1941, although having heart disease, he volunteered to serve in Red Army. At the rank of private he fought in a radio company of a tank division in the southwestern direction of the Kalinin Front. He was promoted to the rank of junior lieutenant and was assigned to the post of radio control assistant to the commander of the armored mechanized forces of Kalinin Front. In 1943, the State Defense Committee, on the petition of Valeria Golubtsova, director of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, he was recalled together with the group of young specialists to work there. After the war, Gutkin led the research work in the institute related to the analysis and development of complex radio engineering systems. This work played a big role in the development of radio engineering in the USSR. In 1952, Gutkn defended his doctoral dissertation, which in 1953 was published in the form of a monograph under the title \\"Transformation and detection of ultrahigh frequencies\\". In 1956 he was awarded the academic title of professor. In 1961, Gutkin was appointed as the head of the newly established Department of Radio Engineering Systems at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute and held this position until 1984. Gutkin contributed to the development of the theory of optimal radio reception methods for complex interference, the theory of optimizing systems and devices for a combination of quality indicators, radio control systems. The theory of optimal radio reception is now widely used in space communications, cellular telephones and in receivers of the satellite radio navigation system Glonass.

In the whole population, one ninth of the adverse outcomes can be attributed to the exposure (AFp = 1/9). In epidemiology, attributable fraction for the population (AFp) is the proportion of incidents in the population that are attributable to the risk factor. Term attributable risk percent for the population is used if the fraction is expressed as a percentage. It is calculated as AF_p = (I_p - I_u)/I_p, where I_p is the incidence in the population, and I_u is the incidence in the unexposed group. Equivalently it can be calculated as AF_p = \\\\frac{P_e(RR - 1)}{1 + P_e(RR-1)}, where P_eis the exposed proportion of the population and RR is the relative risk not adjusted for confounders. It is used when an exposure increases the risk, as opposed to reducing it, in which case its symmetrical notion is preventable fraction for the population.  Synonyms  Multiple synonyms of the attributable fraction for the population are in use: attributable proportion for the population, population attributable proportion, Levin's attributable risk, population attributable risk, and population attributable fraction. Similarly, population attributable risk percent (PAR) is used as a synonym for the attributable risk percent for the population.  Interpretation  Attributable fraction for the population combines both the relative risk of an incident with respect to the factor, as well as the prevalence of the factor in the population. Values of AFp close to 1 indicate that both the relative risk is high, and that the risk factor is prevalent. In such case, removal of the risk factor will greatly reduce the number of the incidents in the population. The values of AFp close to 0, on the other hand, indicate that either the relative risk is low, or that the factor is not prevalent (or both). Removal of such factor from the population will have little effect. Because of this interpretation, the AFp is well suited for the public policy making. For example, in 1953 Levin's paper it was estimated that lung cancer has relative risk of 3.6 - 13.4 in smokers compared to non-smokers, and that the proportion of the population exposed to smoking was 0.5 - 0.96, resulting in the high value of attributable fraction for the population 0.56 - 0.92.  Generalizations  Attributable fraction for the population can be generalized to the case where the multilevel exposure to the risk factor. In such case AF_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i P_i RR_i - \\\\sum_i P_i'RR_i}{\\\\sum_i P_i RR_i}where P_iis the proportion of the population exposed to the level i, P_i'is the desired (ideal) proportion of the population exposed to the level i, and RR_iis the relative risk at exposure level i.

GFER was first reported in 2009 and since Exome sequencing became more available, few more cases were discovered. In all known cases, the disease progresses with conditions that include: congenital cataracts, loss of motor abilities, development delay, degeneration of organs, sometimes hearing loss, etc. Cause The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by a mutation in the nuclear GFER gene (also called ALR; Erv1 homolog in yeast). Mechanism The most major role of GFER is inside the mitochondria's IMS (it is imported into the mitochondria from the cytosol). If we describe the normal pathway as follows: # Cysteine rich subtracts (CX3C, CX9C) which are in the cytosol enter into inter-membrane space via the TOM. # These subtracts are processed by Mia40 protein which folds them. In each fold an SS bond is formed and an electron is taken (through the H atom) into the Mia40. Only in the folded form these folded proteins can further enter to the mitochondria's matrix. # GFER takes the electron from Mia40 and transfer it to cytochrome c. Otherwise, when the GFER does not take the electron: # ETC efficiency will decrease. # Mia40 will be \\"saturated\\" and will not be able to fold the subtracts. These unfolded proteins will not be able to enter the matrix and therefore: ## The mitochondria will lack various building blocks and its ability to maintain itself will be hindered (e.g., It will not be able to produce cytochrome c oxidase and other building blocks for the ETC, maintenance, correction of errors and splitting). ## The IMS will become bloated with partially folded proteins with structural damage. This damage may cause cytochrome c depletion and lead to apoptosis. ## Mia40 and the partially folded protein may free their electrons, eventually, as free radical which hinders the mitochondria, including its DNA, until it cannot repair itself. # Mitochondrial unfolded protein response will be initiated. GFER has a few more roles which may be affected, with dependence on the mutation type and location. These include: * Mitochondrial fission regulation by inhibition of Drp1 * GFER, acts as an augmentor of liver regeneration. * GFER interacts with various protein as a regulator of cell apoptosis process. Treatment Currently there is no curative treatment.

Recompose is a Washington state based company offering a death care service to convert human bodies into soil through a process known as natural organic reduction, or human composting. The process, which takes about 30 days, is a green alternative to the existing disposal options of cremation and burial. In March 2020, Recompose announced the appointment of new General Manager Kira Franz. She comes from more than a year as director of operations at Madrona Venture Labs in Seattle.  The Recompose Process  = How it Works = Recompose has a patent pending process where bodies are placed in a vessel with natural materials such as wood chips and alfalfa. A fan system is setup to provide air that ensures enough oxygen is getting to the body, and the soft tissue breaks down in about a month, transforming into about two wheelbarrows worth of soil. Families of the deceased can keep the soil, use it to plant a tree, or through a partnership with Forterra, Washington's largest land conservation organization, can donate soil to help rehabilitate forest land in Washington State. = Safety = To prove natural organic reduction as safe and effective, Recompose participated in a study with Western Washington University designed and managed by soil scientist Lynne Carpenter-Boggs. Six donors participated in the study and Boggs indicated the result \\"was clean, rich, odorless soil that passed all federal and state safety guidelines for potentially hazardous pathogens and pollutants, such as metals.\\"  Legalization  Washington State is the first state to legalize natural organic reduction. SB 5001, which goes into effect on May 1, 2020. Governor Jay Inslee signed the bill which passed with bipartisan majority: 80-16 in the House and 38-11 in the Senate. A similar bill will be considered in the state of Colorado in 2020. In California, Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) introduced introduced Assembly Bill 2592 to allow for human composting.  Facility  The first Recompose facility will open in the SODO area of Seattle, Washington in the spring of 2021 where 75 vessels will be built and \\"arranged to surround a large, airy gathering space at the center of the 18,500-square-foot facility\\". Architecture firm Olson Kundig is designing the facility, with principal and owner Alan Maskin leading the effort. Maskin indicated \\"This facility hosts the Recompose vessels, but it is also an important space for ritual and public gathering. The project will ultimately foster a more direct, participatory experience and dialogue around death and the celebration of life.” History =Origins= Spade was raised in rural New Hampshire by a family who wasn't religious, but found spirituality in nature. Considering her own mortality Spade wanted more options that were less toxic, environmentally and economically friendly, and options that allowed family and friends to participate in the care of their loved one. She formulated early ideas about the possibility of human recomposition but when she learned about the practice of livestock mortality composting, she began work to create the same option for humans. Katrina Spade was awarded the Echoing Green Climate Fellowship for this work in 2014. =Urban Death Project= Urban Death Project was founded in 2014. It formed a partnership with Western Carolina University's Forensic Anthropology Department. Urban Death Project's Kickstarter Campaign raises $91,000 from over 1200 Backers in 2015.

It is the largest park owned by Doylestown Township, 30 of these acres are being leased to the neighboring Delaware Valley College for farming use. As part of the network of parks in the Doylestown Township and Borough, the purposes of the park are to help foster better health and wellness, serve as protection to the environment and maintain economic prosperity in the surrounding areas. These goals are in line with both state and local Park and Recreation Plans including: Pennsylvania's Recreation Plan, Regional Land Use Plan for Delaware Valley, Bucks County Park and Recreation Plan and others. This space is a dedicated green space consisting of basketball courts, tennis courts soccer fields and walking trails. Doylestown Central Park also includes some more unique features such as Kid's Castle and a sensory trail for the differently abled. alt=  General  Doylestown Central Park is open every day from dawn to dusk. Central Park contains both green space and recreation space including: 5 tennis courts, 2 basketball courts, 3 soccer fields, a bocce court, a golf link, an amphitheater, a toddler play area, Kid's Castle and trails for hiking, walking or biking. Both the tennis and basketball courts have coin operated lighting to illuminate the play area.  History  Central Park was dedicated and opened to the public on June 10, 1995. The land was purchased for $3.7 million from a developer in 1991. The land was originally owned by the local Delaware Valley University. The park was planned under the guidance of the Central Park and Facilities Planning Committee, chaired by John T. Carson Jr. The land was considered an ideal site for a park due to its proximity to a township building located next door on Wells road. This would allow for ease of connection to already existing municipal water, sewage, and electricity lines, decreasing both time and building costs. Since its inception, planners wanted to ensure that the park had both passive and active areas while minimally changing the existing landscape. In 1994, the township received a DCA grant of $100,000 for park development. By 1994, the parking lots, tennis courts, basketball courts, and walking trail were completed.  Park Amenities  = Kid's Castle = Kid's Castle, renovated in 2013 Kid's Castle was inspired by the local castles built by the late Henry Chapman Mercer and opened on June 22, 1997. The design of the playground was an effort by a team of local architects as well as students from the Central Bucks School District. Bob Leathers was hired as architect to refine the design. A group called Friend's of Kid's Castle formed in 2012, with the mission of protecting this playground. The original structure was made of pressure treated wood, but due to heavy use and weathering Kid's Castle underwent a renovation in March 2013 costing $150,000. The renovation lasted just under 7 months. Although the main castle is currently open for public use, part of the renovation included removal of other older playground equipment. The next phase of renovation includes the installation of new playground equipment as well as resurfacing to allow for inclusion of children of all abilities. Completion of the next phases of renovation will require $600,000. = Covenant Bank Amphitheater = Covenant Bank Amphitheater The Doylestown Township and Borough identified in a 2007 Community Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan that building an amphitheater in Central Park would be a short term priority (accomplished between 2008-2010). This came in response to 66% of resident survey respondents stating an amphitheater would be a priority. In the same document it was stressed that in the planning process, it would be critical for the amphitheater to be established as a park hub, not just another structure. The cost for materials and building came to $136,000 all of which came directly from 20 years of fundraising. The amphitheater includes a stage, with an area for storage as well as a changing room and bathroom. The Amphitheater hosts music concerts and free movies in the summer months. Previous to the construction of the physical building, the hillside on which it is located was considered a natural amphitheater and hosted its first concert series in the summer of 1995. = Hike and Bike Trails = Doylestown Central Park is an end point to the 8.5 mile long US 202 Parkway Trail. The current trail is paved and continues alongside the U.S. Route 202 parkway to Pennsylvania Route 63 (Welsh Road) in Montgomeryville. There are plans to extend the trail past Pennsylvania Route 63 into Norristown. There is a parking lot located at the entrance on New Britain Road, allowing for easy access to the trail head. Additionally, there are several connections around Central Park to the Doylestown Hike and Bike System. The first connection was between the park and the neighboring Klutz Elementary School. Supported by both the Doylestown Township and Borough, the Hike and Bike System started its planning stages in 1992, and continues to expand. The goal is to increase connectivity between schools, parks and other points around the township. Functional Fitness station for adults 50+ at Doylestown Central Park = Fitness Trails = Doylestown Central park has several fitness stations installed around the park along the walking trail. Weather permitting, outdoor boot camp classes are hosted on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 6:00-7:00pm. For adults 50 and older, a separate LifeTrail area is available for use. Each station has detailed diagrams depicting usage, as well as different levels of difficulty. A guidance video of equipment use can be viewed on YouTube. 4 out of 9 pods of the Sensory Trail A pod along the sensory trail boardwalk = Sensory Trail = The Sensory Trail opened in October, 2016. It is most readily accessible from the New Brittain road entrance. The sensory trail consists of 9 separate sections, called pods. Some are located along the walking path, and others are within Hart's Woods along a boardwalk. 5 of the pods are wheelchair accessible. Each pod highlights different sensory integration techniques, to help children of all needs (particularly on the autism spectrum) interact with the natural environment. This sensory trail is thought to be one a kind in the state of Pennsylvania. The sensory trail was created in response to the Park and Recreation board wanting to make Central Park more accessible to people of all abilities. The sensory trail cost a total of $442,000 to build, with contributions from the Doylestown Township ($191,000), Foundations Community Partnership ($30,000), Doylestown Lions Club ($30,000), Village improvement Association ($30,000) and a grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Commonwealth Financing Authority. Foundations Community Partnership Grant, Boucher & James, Inc., Pickering Corts and Summerson as well as the Doylestown Township board of Supervisors helped with the design and construction of the sensory trail. Further expansion of the sensory trail may be added with more donations.  Park Wildlife  Picnic bench overlooking meadow at Doylestown Central Park = Meadow = Included as one of the park's passive green areas, the meadow is a portion of the park which remains unmowed. The meadow provides valuable habitat to a variety of species, including the native Blue Bird. The Bucks County Audubon Society as well as members of the Doylestown community sought to increase the native bird population by building and placing nesting boxes in and around the area, including in Central Park. This effort has dramatically increased blue bird sightings from just 2 in 1992 to 100 or more hatchlings a year in 2015. The meadow requires some maintenance by park staff to prevent the growth of shrubs and trees. The meadow habitat allows for different species including: *Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Papilio glaucus *American Grasshopper, Schistocerca americana *Red Winged Blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus *Milkweed, Asclepias syriaca *New York Ironweed, Vernonia noveboracensis *Goldenrod, Solidago rugosa * Storm Water Pond = Storm Water Pond = Adjacent to Kid's castle across the bridge, there is a storm water pond. This storm water pond is also across from the Edgar N. Putman Environmental Education Center. This pond collects excess precipitation runoff. Next to the walkway, a sign details the importance of keeping waterways clean and clear. This storm water pond is considered part of the passive features of Doylestown Central Park, allowing for species to inhabit it, and park visitors to enjoy access to wildlife. = Hart's Woods = A portion of Hart's Woods remains intact within Doylestown Central Park. The forest historically spread to past where US 202 currently The forest is part of a geological formation called Piedmont Physiographic Province, spanning from New Jersey through Pennsylvania and as far south as Alabama. The clay soil here is known to be fertile and is able to support the growth of the mature Oak-Beech Hart's Woods. The habitat of Hart's Woods allows for different species including: *American Beech, Fagus grandifolia *Red Oak, Quercus rubra *Spicebush, Lindera benzoin *False Solomon's Seal, Maianthemum racemosum *Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina *American Woodcock, Scolopax minor *Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla In the interest of protecting these species, the Hart's Woods portion of the park is a designated wildlife area, and is off limits to dogs.  Environmental Education Area  Doylestown Central Park Native Plant Garden and outdoor classroom In 2004, Doylestown planned to acquire an additional 23 acres from the neighboring Doylestown Station Townhomes to become the new Environmental Education Area. As with the construction of the original park space, the goal was to limit the changes made to the original land features. The Environmental Education Area walking trail connects to the back of the Kid's Castle area, the adjacent neighborhood, as well as to the local Kutz Elementary School. Funding from Pulte, DCNR, and PECO Green Region Open Space Program allowed for the opening of the Environmental Education Area to be dedicated and opened as an official part of central park in 2006. A portion of the wetland education trail was completed in 2011. The Edgar N. Putman Environmental Education Center was dedicate on May 13, 2011. The invasive species trail was completed in January 2012. Beyond regular park visitors, the Environmental Education Area is used by activities from programs such as: No Child Left Inside, park and recreation programs, and Environmental Advisory Council with the outdoor classroom acting as a hub for hosting these programs. = Invasive Species = Doylestown Central Park hopes to educate visitors on the damaging effects invasive species can have on existing habitats. Posted signage describes management techniques like early detection, manual removal and chemical application, while also providing tips for visitors to help and apply on an individual scale. The posed solutions are education, not planting invasive species in gardens, removal of invasive species, minimal landscape disturbance, limiting fertilizer use and monitoring. The following plants are known invasive species in Pennsylvania: * Canada Thistle, Cirsium arvense * Multiflora Rose, Rosa multiflora * Johnson Grass, Sorghum halepense * Kudzu, Pueraria lobata * Purple Loofestrife, Lythrum salicaria * Common Reed Grass, Phragmites australis A more comprehensive list of invasive species can be located on the invasive species fact sheet on the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources webpage.

Background  In Saarland, coal has been mined over several centuries. At times, the industry was the largest employer in the region. In June 2012, the last coal mine, Bergwerk Saar, was closed. Since then, there has been no more coal mining in the Saarland. Nevertheless, the history of the coal mining industry, along with its associated traditions, is part of the region’s heritage.  History of the Saar Polygon  The Saar Polygon under construction In the setting of the coal mining industry ending, an organization called “Bergbauerbe Saar Association” was founded whose stated purpose is to promote the cultural heritage of mining with the establishment of a landmark that celebrates the contribution that the miners had in the region. In cooperation with RAG AG, which last operated the coal mining industry in Saarland through its subsidiary, RAG Deutsche Steinkohle AG, a design contest for the monument was announced. 147 designs were submitted, and the winner of the competition was the Berlin architect duo Katja Pfeiffer and Oliver Sachse. Their design for a walk-through large-scale sculpture demonstrates multiple mountain motifs as a symbol of change and is intended appear to be a gateway into the future. The meaning behind the design of the steel grid construction is the inseparability the past and future of the country and showing the traditional bond of coal, steel and energy in Saarland. Construction began in late 2015. The sculpture was completed in the spring of 2016 and was inaugurated in September 2016 and opened to the public. The approximately two million euros in construction costs were financed by the association Bergbauerbe Saar Association, RAG AG, the RAG Foundation, the Saarland state government, and donations. Donors could symbolically buy a step inside the monument for 1000 euros; at each level, a plaque with the name of the donor was placed.  Location  Saar Polygon on the old spoil pile of the Bergwerk Saar coal mine The Saar Polygon stands on the spoil tip of the Bergwerk Saar coal mine. This pile, with an area of about 50 hectares, rises about 150 meters above the surrounding Saar Valley. Due to its prominent position, the polygon is visible from all directions. France and Luxembourg are visible from the structure.  Description  Inside the Saar Polygon The walk-in monument is about 30 meters high. The top of the structure is a platform, which spans approximately 35 meters long and is supported by two slanting towers with exactly 132 steps going up 25 meters. The viewing platform weighs around 60 tons. The Saar Polygon is designed to have a different shape depending on the direction it is viewed such as a rectangular arch, a triangle, an inverted triangle, and an hourglass. Furthermore, it resembles the structures that are used in mines for support.

The tear gas canister that struck him was fired from the rear door of a military vehicle at which he was throwing stones while running after it. The incident raised questions about Israeli military behavior when engaging with the demonstrators. Some Israeli military officials used social media to defend the army. Israeli army statements said that Tamimi was throwing a rock when he was targeted and that the soldier firing the canister \\"did not see any people in the line of fire\\" and was not criminally liable. Tamimi's brother, Louai, rejected the investigation saying he was not approached by the investigators although he said he witnessed the incident as he was standing close to the army jeep at the time of the shot. Background Residents of Nabi Saleh had protested against the Halamish settlement since 1976 when it was first built. Demonstrations were stepped up in 2009 when the settlers claimed a fresh-water spring historically used by the village. The protests were regularly disbanded by Israeli troops using tear gas, and were often accompanied by stone-throwing by local youths. Sarit Michaeli, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, who was in Nabi Saleh, said she was aware of dozens of cases where, \\"in violation of explicit regulations\\", tear gas canisters were fired directly at protesters by Israeli soldiers and border policemen. Event Tamimi on the ground after being hit by the shot During one of the weekly demonstrations to protest the seizure of Nabi Saleh land by a neighboring Israeli settlement, Tamimi was hit in the head below his right eye by a tear-gas canister fired at close range from the rear door of an Israeli armored vehicle, while he was throwing stones at it. The projectile fired towards Tamimi can be seen in a photograph of the incident. According to the Israeli activist Haim Schwarczenberg, Tamimi fell down after he was shot at. His friends then rushed to him and \\"covered his bloodied face with a black-and-white Palestinian checkered scarf\\". He was taken to Beilinson Hospital in central Israel where he died from his wounds the next day. Aftermath =Funeral= Thousands of Palestinians participated in Tamimi's funeral where his body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, was moved from the hospital in Ramallah north to Nabi Saleh in West Bank. Participants held up posters showing graphic images of Tamimi's injuries. These were also \\"plastered on monuments in Ramallah's central squares\\". The mourning event turned violent. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters in response to stones being thrown and tried to push the protesters back using \\"jets of skunk water, a foul-smelling chemical waste spray\\". Four Israelis and two foreign activists were arrested. Six people, including Israeli activist Jonathan Pollack, were injured at the funeral. =Investigations= The Israeli army said it was investigating the incident. In its initial statement, Israeli military said that Tamimi \\"threw rocks at IDF soldiers\\". Later investigation said that the soldier \\"did not see any people in the line of fire\\" and was not criminally liable. According to the IDF the soldier could not clearly see Tamimi and did not \\"aim\\" to shoot the gas canister at him. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem questioned the legality of the soldier's act since he \\"could not ensure that no harm will result\\". IDF also said that they could not reconstruct the event because there were rocks thrown at the investigators. Tamimi's brother, Louai, rejected the investigation saying that investigators had not approached him although he was a witness to the incident standing about from the army jeep when the soldier shot. Speaking to the Reuters he said: \\"there is no doubt that he saw us, and struck my brother directly\\". The IDF speaker said a Palestinian witness refused to testify. Tamimi running towards the Jeep, the tear-gas launcher appearing from the rear door, the canister in the air, and then \\"Tamimi falling to the ground, clutching his face\\", are seen in photographs taken of the incident. According to B'Tselem the fact it took two years for the military to come to a decision, though the incident was \\"well-documented\\", indicated \\"the failure of the military investigation system.\\" B'Tselem also said that the decision announced by the military was not in accordance with its regulations over the use of tear gas. =Controversies= Tamimi's supporters accused Israeli soldiers \\"of using excessive force to deal with the protester, delaying an ambulance from reaching him and not letting his family or others to be with him\\". Tamimi's death, and the photo which was said to record the moment before he was hit, raised concerns over the Israeli military's use of force in dealing with Palestinian demonstrators. Human-rights groups questioned whether the forces respect military rules of engagement for demonstrators. The \\"widely publicized\\" photograph gave the impression that the Israeli soldier had deliberately targeted Tamimi. The Telegraph described Israeli military officials as \\"largely unapologetic for the death\\", and trying to prove Tamimi had thrown stones by \\"releasing pictures of a sling they said was found on Tamimi's body\\". Some of the military officials \\"defended the army and attacked Tamimi\\" via Twitter, among them Peter Lerner, then spokesman for the IDF Central Command, whose Twitter comment caused the most \\"outrage\\", according to The Telegraph, and a \\"storm\\", according to Yedioth Ahronoth. \\"What was Mustafa thinking running after a moving jeep while throwing stones #fail\\", posted Lerner. (\\"Fail\\" is an American slang term used in a derogatory manner to denote \\"extreme stupidity\\".) Yedioth Ahronoth wrote that Lerner intended \\"to use the word in its literal sense–as failure\\", and that he had shown his \\"happiness\\" for Tamimi's chance of survival after he was transferred to the hospital. Lerner later denied the mockery and said he did not mean \\"to hurt anyone's feelings by writing 'fail'\\", and that \\"fail\\" was directed at activists who he believed were not impartial relating the incident. Lerner described the death as an \\"individual tragedy, with an awful outcome\\" and believed that Tamimi had \\"put himself at unnecessary risk\\" and that the soldier \\"had operated within the realm of their responsibility\\".

In December 1844, the Astronomer Royal at the Cape, Thomas Maclear, instructed his assistant William Mann to build a beacon in the form of a pile of rocks which would be used to confirm and possibly expand on the existing curvature of the earth data of Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. This data was in connection with the Cape arc of the meridian. Initially the beacon had no name but in later years it was named after Maclear. In 1929, the pile of stones collapsed and it was restored in 1979 to commemorate the centenary of Maclear's death. The beacon is still used by cartographers today. It has become a tourist attraction and hiking trails over the mountain pass next to the beacon. It is also a National Monument.

Dating between 5000 BCE-500 CE and roughly 104,000 m2 in area, the site is one of the largest pastoralist cemeteries in Africa with over 3,000 burials excavated thus far. The site was first excavated by Sir Henry Wellcome from 1911–1914. Artifacts found at the site suggest trade routes between Jebel Moya and its surrounding areas, even as far as Egypt.  Environment  The Gezira Plain is a megafan created by the Blue Nile. Present day flood levels were in place by 3500 BCE, as the area transitioned from swampy conditions to a savanna as the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone moved south. The environmental transition from swamp to savanna and semi-desert steppe was complete by 3000 BCE. By the early centuries CE, few swampy conditions remained; one notable wet site that remained is Jebel et Tomat, another early pastoralist site, northeast of Jebel Moya. Environmentally, the Southern Gezira can be separated into categories of swamp vegetation, riverine woodland, grassland, and jebel vegetation. This places the environment of Jebel Moya close to transitional belts, in both modern day, and probably the Classic and Meroitic periods. Jebel Moya refers to a massif which includes a group of granite hills connected by ridges and valleys; the name has become associated with the archaeological site within the north-easternmost of these valleys. The Jebel Moya massif is a geological granite outcrop of the Gezira Plain's underlying Basement Complex, which breaks through the above Sandstone Formation. The Basement Complex contains an underground aquifer, which results in fresh water rising to the surface/ground level around outcrops like Jebel Moya. This established Jebel Moya as a potential fresh water source, which is important in a plain without permanent surface water sources for maintaining animal herds. The aquifer is replenished by both the Blue and While Niles. This establishes that the ecological conditions in the region were suitable for pastoralism from 1000 BCE-1000 CE.  Excavation history  Excavations at Jebel Moya began January 29, 1911 and continued until April 1914 when further plans were abandoned due to the onset of World War I. During those four seasons, approximately a fifth of the 10.4 hectare site was excavated. 2883 graves were reported during the excavation, and 2792 of the graves were cleared, the rest remained undisturbed. Some graves, devoid of burials, contained only pottery; others had multiple inhumations. 25 of the graves contained animal burials. In total, 3137 individuals were excavated, which marks Jebel Moya as the largest burial complex yet found in sub-Saharan Africa. = Season 1 = Wellcome supervised the first field season, from January 29 - April 1911. An unrecorded number of graves were excavated during the first field season, but it was evidently enough for Wellcome to apply and receive a concessions license. = Season 2 = 300x300px Wellcome appointed Oric Bates as field director for the second field season (December 1911- April 1912). He also appointed Douglas Derry as the first chief medical officer and field bioanthropologists. A total of 709 graves were excavated in the East and South Jebel sectors. During the second season, construction began on the “House of Boulders”, designed to absorb laborers not required for excavation work; they worked to erect workshops and iron shed stores. = Season 3 = Field directorship was handed to James Dixon and G.A. Wainwright for the third field season, from November 1912 - April 1913, assisted by M.B. Ray and L. Dudley Buxton, who replaced Derry. A total of 310 graves were excavated in the Southwest, West, South and Northeast, but not East, sectors during the third season. = Season 4 = The final season, from Nov 1913 - April 1914, yielded 1772 graves. The onset of the first World War disrupted any plans for future seasons. Work did not resume after the war ended, and Wellcome passed away in 1936. = Post- Excavation = Due to a variety of setbacks, including two world wars and Wellcome's death in 1936, the first official report on Jebel Moya was not published until 1949 by Frank Addison, who was appointed by the Wellcome Trust. The Trustees of the Wellcome Trust also appointed G.M. Morant, assisted by Otto Samson, to examine the remains from Jebel Moya. Unable to continue after the Second World War, the project to complete osteological work was transferred to J.C. Trevor, who employed R. Mukherjee and C.R. Rao to do the majority of the analyses. They published their analysis in 1955. During the 41 years in between excavating and the 1955 study re-examining the remains from Jebel Moya, a significant amount of material was lost due to poor storage conditions. Materials from Jebel Moya had been shipped to a depot in Maryleborne, and a warehouse in Dartford, London. The Dartford warehouse flooded in 1928; surviving materials, along with the Maryleborne materials, were shipped to Stamore in Middlesex, where Addison and his assistant L. P. Kirwan began their work, in 1937. During this time, undecorated pottery sherds were discarded as waste, as they were (falsely) considered to lack any diagnostic properties. Out of the 3000-plus skeletons excavated, 98 crania and 139 mandibles, as well as a small number of other post cranial bones, survived. However, the original field cards for all of the skeletons remained. Unfortunately, only 326 of the 2903 field cards contained complete information of observations and measurements made on site during the excavation. Only 25% of the cards contained accurate or useful information. Like the skeletal remains, only a small number of excavated artifacts survived their time in storage. Despite the setbacks caused by these conditions, the 1955 report was groundbreaking for its use of the now common Mahalanobis D2 distance to craniometric data; according to the Mukherjee, “The result was a measure of group divergence between Jebel Moya and 19 other African samples.”  Dates  = Frank Addison's dating = Due to errors with stratigraphic information from the original excavations, Addison's original dating (1000-400 BCE) for occupation and use of the site was inaccurate. He later modified the dates to between 400 BCE-400 CE, coinciding with the Meroitic kingdom to the north. = Rudolf Gerharz' dating = In 1994, Rudolf Gerharz’ reinterpretation of the dating of Jebel Moya, based on Addison's data, included three more accurate time phases for the site. Phase I (5000 BCE) included occasional occupations at the site, and Dotted Wavy Line pottery. Phase II (3000-800 BCE) included the majority of the graves at Jebel Moya, including burials in the western half, and many unspecified burials with no or little grave goods from the eastern half. Phase III (800-100 BCE) is potentially the first to feature trade items from the north, particularly metals, ceramics and glass. Phase III encompassed the remainder of the graves in the eastern half of Jebel Moya. Gerharz’ estimates for the second and third phases were incorrect; the absence of Meroitic wheel-made pottery at Jebel Moya does not indicate the site's abandonment by 100 BCE, given the appearance of locally manufactured wheel made pottery. = Current dating = Current hypotheses posit that a network of craft communities allowed the spread of ideas and animals into central/south-central Sudan between 6000-5000 BCE. All surviving site features, including graves, date in Phase II (ca. 3000-800 BCE) and Phase III (800-100 BCE). The main occupation at Jebel Moya is dated to 2300 BCE. The first conclusive evidence for burials at Jebel Moya dates to the mid-first century BCE. Period 1, following Gerharz' Phase I, dates to the late sixth or early fifth millennium BCE. Period 2 dates between 2500-1500 BCE. It is inferred from surrounding economies to the north that during this period, the inhabitants of Jebel Moya were pastoral or agro-pastoral. Period 3 dates between 100 BCE and 500 CE, during which the majority of the burials were interred. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry dating of bone samples from Jebel Moya were unsuccessful due to lack of collagen. OSL dating of pottery is the first absolute date from Jebel Moya.  Habitation  Because of the permanent source of water, there were multiple habitation sites as well as grave sites at Jebel Moya used by pastoralists in the area. During the Wellcome Excavations, evidence of habitation sites were found. Most field notes concerning the habitation sites did not survive. Human-made features at Jebel Moya include three hearths, three hardened mud floors, one of which contained post-holes, and a second contained a hearth. These finds are consistent with habitation activity and possibly contemporary with Phase I (5000 BCE). Located above these works were three ovens, along with post-holes. Mud plaster was found in one of the strata, and a patch of burnt clay flooring in another. These findings support the theory of habitations remaining through all three phases of occupation. During the second field season, a series of stone structures were found and recorded by Oric Bates. On January 20, 1912, a series of small stone structures in the East sector of the cemetery were recorded. On January 24, 1912, a seventh semi-circular stone 7 meters in length was found 30 cm below surface level. Bates believed the structures, composed of small stones, were not associated with any specific burial, and were perhaps parts of shelters, or stone platforms for sacrificing or feasting. Nineteen ovens were found in the Southwest sector of Jebel Moya. The ovens were barrel shaped pits plastered in mud, 40–50 cm in depth, 70–80 cm in diameter. The oven pits contained burnt animal bones, stones, pottery sherds, and fragments of querns. Addison posited that the stones were heated in an external area and then placed in the oven, with food placed over it, to slowly cook. The available data suggests that settlement at Jebel Moya during Phase I was likely episodic. The lack of data from the rest of the valley prevents a concrete answer pertaining to the potentiality of a permanent settlement or a seasonal one during Phase II. The presence of ovens, co-occurring with mortuary activity, suggests that the site was permanently occupied during Phase III.  Mortuary complex  = Depth and orientation = The depth of the site from the highest point on the ground surface to the lowest point on bedrock was 2.8 meters. 36 of the burials were crouched, 217 of the burials were prone, and 1695 burials were supine, with 355 on their left side, and 430 on their right side. The majority of the burials were facing somewhat north or west. = Burials = 432x432px All ages and sexes were represented in the burials at Jebel Moya. 2026 burials (64.7%) were buried without grave goods; many had only a small number. According to Addison's report, “There was little evidence of a standard mortuary practice; tomb types differed in appearance, body position varied widely, and graves ‘were oriented to every point of the compass.\\" In addition to human burials, 55 occurrences of cattle bones were found, either as individual cattle burials, or in association with a human burial. Several cattle figurines made of clay were also excavated, though none were associated with the graves or burials. There is little evidence of a standard burial practice. Tomb types, body positions, and orientations often differed. 24 burials are associated with pottery; sixteen are from whole or mostly whole vessels, four are “pot bursts” where sherds cover a portion of the body, and seven have loose pottery sherds. They are all from Assemblage 3(100 BCE-500 CE). Graves at Jebel Moya were either round pits, oval graves, or graves of indeterminate shape. No permanent grave markings appear, or at least none have survived. There is a strong uniformity in number and type of burial assemblages; a high level of androgyny, at least in a mortuary realm.  Infant burials  There are 93 infant burials at Jebel Moya, 35 of which have associated grave foods. The largest percentage of oval burials occurs for infant burials (16.13%). They are not distinguishable from other burials in terms of orientation and burial type, and do not form a distinct area on the cemetery. There are no artifacts exclusively seen in infant burials, but the burials seem to have a restricted range of goods: beads, bracelets, pendants, and lipstuds.  Juvenile burials  There are 199 juvenile burials at Jebel Moya, 67 of which have associated grave goods. Like the infants, there are no exclusive categories for juveniles, however, a wider array of artifacts were found with juveniles than infants. Grave shapes are similar to that of adults. Juvenile burials were not distinguished from adult burials in terms of bodily orientation, burial posture, or burial location within the cemetery.  Young adults  Young adults had no categories exclusive to them. A wide variety of artifacts were found in association with burials. They were buried similarly to adults.  Adults  Adults graves far outnumbered the rest, totaling 2421, 880 of which have associated assemblages. Adults have the greatest quantity of material items. There is no strong depositional preference for materials to be associated more or less with males or females, except in the Southwest sector of the cemetery, where lip studs seem to be associated with females. There is no comparative data for the rest of cemetery. = Status = There is some kind of spatial relationship present in the Northeast Sector of the cemetery, where a higher percentage of “rich” burials are found, and less “poor” ones. Explanations include the existence of some kind of above ground marker. While there is a large amount of uniformity in artifact categories, there is a distinct pattern unique to rich burials, creating an area of prestige. The presence of carnelian, highly prized elsewhere during this time, supports the potential of these burials being of a social elite. There was an increased ratio in the Northeast sector, perhaps ‘lesser lineages’ trying to associate with a dominant lineage. Only in the Northeast section of the site, where there is the highest density of burials, is there a distinct spatial pattern. The 27 burials with the most amount of grave goods formed a “spatial neighborhood”; there were fewer burials with less or no grave goods within a 20-meter radius of any “rich” burial. “In other words, there appears to have been some kind of social prohibition on burying within 20 meters of these richest burials, and the individual locations of these burials were permanently marked in some unknown way. The ‘rich’ burials are identical to ‘poor’ burials in terms of construction features; they are relatively shallow, and are unlined. Individuals of both rich and poor burials are of the same homogenous group.  Artifacts  Only a fraction of the artifacts found at Jebel Moya were grave goods; however, due to the sheer number of burials, a significant amount of material was still found. Nearly half of the graves contained no artifacts, and most of those that did contained only a few beads or lip studs. Artifacts found at habitation sites include lip studs, beads and other ornaments, hundreds of stone tools, some imported objects, and ‘several tons of potsherds’. Pottery and grave goods in grave. Wellcome Collection. Artifacts associated with the graves include: amulets, anklets, armlets, beads, bone point implements, borers, bowls, bracelets, celts, clips, coils, earrings, earstuds, grindstones, hair clips, hair ornaments, knives, lipstuds, maceheads, needles, nosestuds, pebbles, pendant, pins, quirms, rings, rubbers, scarabs, shells, and statuettes. Some artifacts are certifiably manufactured from outside the southern Gezira plain. Burials 263 and 524 in the East and Northeast sectors respectively, each contained a bronze statuette of the Egyptian god Shu, dating either during the Napatan or Meroitic period. A scarab in a burial in the Northeast Sector of the site, was described by Frank Addison as a steatite scaraboid, “engraved on both the back and the base. Back: Ram of Amen beneath a sacred tree. In front of the ram is an uraeus. Base: The name Men-Ka-Ra flanked by uraei” (Referring to Menkhepera, the first Napatan ruler of the 25th Dynasty, 747-716 BCE). The artifacts found at Jebel Moya reinforce the idea of two distinct habitation periods at Jebel Moya. Of the burials that did contain grave goods, the majority had only a few; often ornaments that would have been worn in life. Of the 3135 human burials, 1108 (35.3%) have associated grave goods, and 2026 (64.7%) do not. The raw materials for these artifacts came from sources along the Nile and further north, likely brought by the Meroitic trade routes. The presence of cattle figurines (not associated with burials) as well as cattle burials supports the conclusion that the inhabitants of Jebel Moya were pastoralists. There are 55 occurrences of cattle bones among the burials at Jebel Moya, either in association with human burials, or in separate burials by themselves. The lack of agricultural equipment at Jebel Moya, contrasting Jebel et Tomat's numerous grindstones and evidence of sorghum, furthers the idea that the population at Jebel Moya was primarily pastoralist. Like the human remains, only a fraction of the items found at Jebel Moya survived.  Pottery  Most of the pottery found at Jebel Moya was not directly inside burials, but found in burial contexts. The pottery samples at Jebel Moya are categorized into assemblages, by their types and dates. Assemblage 1, with only 13 remaining sherds, consists of designs and motifs using stamped objects and combs to create lines. It dates to the Late Mesolithic (late 6000s BCE). The clay used for the pottery contains sand, mica, and bone. There is no burnishing on Assemblage 1 pottery. Assemblage 2 pottery, with 104 sherds, also was created using stamps, combs, and corded sticks. This assemblage dates to 2500-1500 BCE. There are 369 sherds of Assemblage 3 pottery. They are highly burnished, thin compared to Assembly 2, and red slipped. Decorations were made with combs, stylus, and cord. Most designs on the body of the vessel in zoned geometric forms. The temper contains mica and bone, and date from 100 BCE to 500 CE. To attempt to gain more dating information for Jebel Moya, six sherds of pottery have been OSL dated. Three samples each from Assemblages 2 and 3 were each dated. Although OSL dating has a large standard error of deviation, there is no overlap between any of the dates from Assemblage 2 and 3 sherds. This indicates three broad temporal phases at Jebel Moya. While Assemblage 1 was not OSL dated, the relative date is 600-500 BCE, via a previous pottery analysis. There are no burials associated with pottery during this period. Similar pottery to Assemblage 2 was found at other local sites, such as Rabak to the west and at Jebel et Tomat to the northwest. Assemblage 3 has been OSL dated from 100 BCE to 500 CE. The majority of the graves at Jebel Moya date from this time. The later occupation of Jebel et Tomat also dates to this period, whose pottery is similar to Jebel Moya's during this period. Both are thin and burnished. Assemblage 3 pottery was also found at Abu Geili, an agro- pastoralist site 30 kilometers east of Jebel Moya. The pottery found at both Jebel Moya and Abu Geili shows the socio-economic ties between their respective communities. A number of hand made pottery forms likened to that found at Jebel Moya indicate a trade network and contemporary existence between it and Abu Geili. Feeding cup found in the grave of two infants. In Gerharz' study of Jebel Moya pottery, he identified nine pottery categories, and relatively dated them. * Impressed and Dotted Wavy Line pottery (Phase 1) * Rabak Ware, with everted rims and decorated lips (Phase 2) * Incised and Rocked pottery (Phase 2 and 3) * Scratched ware, designs were etched onto the surface using a blunt instrument once the surface was dry (Phase 3) * Notched ware, regular dots impressed using a rocker tool (Phase 3) * Red Painted ware, rims are often notched, sherds painted with parallel lines (similar sherds found at Abu Geili) (Phase 3) * Channeled ware, deeply incised parallel lines (Phase 3) * Moulded ware, small occurrences of pottery resembling crescent horns in shape (Phase 3) *Specific vessel types from Phase 3: feeding cups, footed dishes, beaker, bowls with pedestal rings = Petrographic study = Three Period 3 sherds of pottery were petrographically tested; they all had common characteristics, which include “abundant, poorly-sorted, generally angular inclusions of quartz and feldspar in a non-calcareous clay matrix”. There was little processing to the clay before vessel construction, and no evidence of any kind of temper to the clay. This analysis also ‘confirmed’ that it was likely the inhabitants of Jebel Moya who inhabited Jebel Saqadi 20 km to the Northwest. After World War II, the excavation records, remains, and artifacts were placed with the Duckworth Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they remain. Most of the pottery excavated at Jebel Moya was donated to the British Museum, with some finds going to the Petrie Museum (University College London), the Pitt Rivers Museum (University of Oxford) and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (University of Cambridge). Only a few artifacts were returned to Sudan.  The peoples of Jebel Moya  = Craniometric data = Cultural diversity in artifacts suggested that Jebel Moyans could have been biologically diverse; Murkhajee et al. tested this theory by measuring the skulls of the remaining skeletons in England. Craniometric testing by Murkhajee and Rao concluded that \\"physical characters of the Jebel Moyans are reliably represented by the mean values for the sample\\" (Mukherjee); that is, the population was stable in a heterogeneous composition over time (3000 years). Craniometric data shows unlikely similarities between far west Africans (historic Ibo and Cameroon), potentially supporting an unlikely west African link. = Dental morphology = The dental study by J.D. Irish et al. was modeled on the original craniometric testing done by Murkhajee and Rao, and results were similar; ‘indications of outside biological influence’. 36 dental traits were recorded in 19 African samples. The phenetic similarity suggests that the population at Jebel Moya contains features from both sub-Saharan and North African peoples, but is specifically distinct from those populations. Results suggest that the population of Jebel Moya was uniform, but distinct, from other populations. The population of Jebel Moya shows the closest dental similarities to North Africans, but cranially, the population was more similar to sub-Saharan samples. This could be due to different heritability of dental vs. cranial features. These results show that Jebel Moyans had a complex genetic heritage from populations surrounding central Sudan. Regardless of the origin of the population of Jebel Moya, culturally, it was distinctive from (aforementioned) outside groups. Dental data puts Jebel Moyans closest to Ethiopians and A-group Nubians, and furthers from Meroitic and C-group Nubians - which shows a cultural influence without ‘biological affinity’. The appearance of this distinct Jebel Moya group coincided with the beginning of Phase 2 (3000-800 BCE) and continued through Phase 3 (800-100BC); this corresponds with recovered skeletal remains. Gerharz regarded the Jebel Moyans as a distinct heterogeneous culture which blended various elements from outside groups. The diversity in grave types, orientations, and goods is supportive of this theory. Gerharz theory suggests that Jebel Moya was an ‘annual meeting place of widely distributed segmentary family units, the common identity of which was maintained by their periodical cohabitation there’. Overall: Jebel Moyans appeared to be most closely biologically related to northeast Africans. Culturally, there appears to be a mosaic of northern, southern, and western influences, incorporated into a distinct Jebel Moya Complex. = 1999 dental analysis = In 1999, a dental analysis was performed by Rachel Hutton MacDonald (1999). Her dental anthropological study of occlusal macrowear, buccal microwear and carious lesions, give evidence that the inhabitants of Jebel Moya were pastoralists. MacDonald studied teeth samples from Jebel Moya in comparison with hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and agriculturalist societies. Dental caries occur when the enamel of the teeth demineralizes due to a pH in the mouth below 5.5. 2411 teeth from Jebel Moya were studied, with .2% having caries, which is the same as known pastoral societies. In contrast, the incidence of caries in Meroitic Nubia was 15.1%. The caries at Jebel Moya most frequently occurred on the third molar, whereas in known agricultural populations, caries occurred most on the second molar. Dental macrowear was also examined; wear patterns between the first and second molars were examined. Data was collected on the amount of visible dentine, the wear, angle, and wear direction. Hunter-gatherers exhibited different patterns of tooth wear (incisors an canines) relative to their molars and premolars. Pastoralists and agriculturalists wore down molars first. Hunter gatherers had rounded horizontal wear forms; pastoralists and agriculturalists had oblique wear angles, and cupped wear forms. Enamel chipping was common on the teeth from Jebel Moya; perhaps of a dietary cause, or due to the use of teeth as tools. It affected men and women equally. There was also deliberate removal of some teeth. Abscesses in pastoral populations have been attributed to teeth wearing on each other, and at Jebel Moya, the wearing of lip studs. Anterior teeth are more commonly lost to abscess in pastoralists. The ritual removing of these teeth at Jebel Moya perhaps accounts for this. 292 individuals had teeth removed, ranging from lower central incisors, to all incisors, upper canine, etc. There are 69 instances of upper incisors being removed, canines were removed in 8 occurrences. = Results = The results of the craniometric study, the dental morphology and general dental comparison study, show the population of Jebel Moya was pastoralist in nature, distinctive bio- culturally, displaying similarities to sub-Saharan Africans. The individuals at Jebel Moya were from a pastoralist, homogenous though biologically distinct population.  Abandonment  It is unknown why Jebel Moya was abandoned; one possibility, according to M. Brass, is the alteration of trade and social networks in the southern Gezira Plain due to the spread of Christianity during the 600s CE.

The church currently has only one parish, two chapels and a group of believers of the Belarusian language. Bishop Andrew Hall was chosen as the church's superior on April 12, 2018. He embraced this position until July 31, 2018.Misja (pl) The initial assumption of the Church is to establish cooperation with other Polish-Catholic Churches operating in Poland, Germany and the United States. Theology According to the church law which is currently in force, the Polish-Catholic Church professes Catholic faith, morality and principles as set forth in the Bible, formulated in common symbols of faith and decisions of the First seven Ecumenical Councils. The Polish-Catholic Church has many similarities to the Roman Catholic liturgy in that it expresses Trinitarian doctrine, Marian devotion and reverence for the saints. The church also employs the traditional Catholic liturgical calendar. The central point of spiritual life within the church is the Eucharist, which is understood as the re-presentation of the redeeming sacrifice of Christ. The church also pays reverence to the angels, apostles, martyrs and saints, keeping among them a special place for the Virgin Mary. According to the church, a sin is an intentional and voluntary breaking of God's or the church's commandments. The seven deadly sins are pride, envy, lust, anger, greed, sloth, and gluttony. Penitents gain the absolution of sins by participating in the sacrament confession, where sins are confessed in the presence of a priest in order to gain absolution. The conditions of a good confession are: # Examination of conscience # Repentance # Firm purpose of amendment # Sincere confession # Compensation to God and neighbours. There are one form of confession exercised in Polish-Catholic Church in United Kingdom: individual (other Polish-Catholic churches are also corporate). Individual confession takes place privately with a priest, while corporate confession is exercised as a separate public ceremony in front of the altar, or as a part of Mass during the Act of Penitence. Individual confession is obligatory for all faithful . It is believed that proper and frequent reception of the sacrament of confession will allow an individual to grow in the spiritual life. Clergy A priest can only be a man who has completed the relevant theological studies. Candidates also need approval from Church authorities. Clergy of the Polish-Catholic Church are not bound to celibacy. =List of superiors= * August 1, 2018 – May 12, 2019 – Archbishop Arthur Wiecinski * April 12–July 31, 2018 – Bishop Andrew HallOfficers (en) See also * Polish Catholicism * Polish-Catholic Church of Republic of Poland * Old Catholic Church in Poland * Polish National Catholic Church References External links *Polish-Catholic Church in UK (pl) Category:Independent Catholic denominations United Kingdom Category:Christian organizations established in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Polish-Catholic Church in United Kingdom"},{"id":"57375788","text":"Philippe Aubert (born 4 September 1943) is a Swiss judoka.

Ali trained in the facility preparing for numerous fights, such as Rumble in the Jungle in 1974, and Thrilla in Manila in 1975.  History  = 1970s = Muhammad Ali was the owner of the camp from 1972 to 1997. He trained there from 1972 to 1980. Before Ali trained at the Deer Lake camp, he mostly trained at the 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1970, when Muhammad Ali came back to boxing, he attracted significant media attention. Ali's closest friend, who helped him regain his license Gene Kilroy, introduced Ali to Bernie Pollack, a furrier in Pottsville, Pa., who had undeveloped land just outside Deer Lake. Kilroy, who was Ali's closest confidant and business manager, brought Ali to the area and urged him to purchase the secluded site in an area called Sculps Hill. Kilroy told Ali that he was going to make a businessman of him, and introduced him to a top-flight accounting firm. Kilroy knew all along that Ali could use the site as a tax write off and the accounting firm acknowledged Kilroy’s savviness. A total of 8 log cabins were built and served as quarters for Ali's support personnel. In addition, a Mosque was built for Ali to practice his religious beliefs of Islam. The gym was the focal point where he trained along with a kitchen, two bunkhouses where his sparring partners trained and another house, now known as the Ali house where he stayed by himself away from distractions. In addition, there was a Chalet for Ali's wife to stay with the couples four children. The land was purchased in 1971 and construction commenced immediately with the gym being the first building erected. Kilroy felt that this site was perfectly suited for a man of Ali's stature and popularity; away from the big city lights and media of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore and Washington. It was without question the best move for Ali, who loved Deer Lake until his passing on June 3, 2016. Over the years, thousands of adoring fans visited his training facility;[1] and many celebrities, including the Jackson 5, have visited his training camp. = 1980s-90s = After Ali's retirement from the ring, he sold the camp to George Dillman in 1997.https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/sports/boxing/muhammad- ali/2016/07/21/muhammad-alis-old-training-camp-sold/87399574/ = Present day = Following Ali's death on June 3, 2016, Dillman reopened the compound to the public, including the gym, kitchen, and the cabins. It was then sold to Mike Madden, the son of John Madden, in July 2016. Muhammad Ali built his training camp in the small town of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania.  Inside the compound  After Ali bought the land in 1972, he began to build the cabins by cutting down trees, and getting logs. The compound included a visitors cabin, a gym, a dining hall, a mosque, and his family house. It also included a five stall barn for his horses and donkey. The compound included boulders that showed the names of boxing legends, friends, and opponents such as Sonny Liston, Joe Louis, Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee, and Joe Frazier.

It collapsed at the start of World War I. FIET was founded in 1921, in Vienna, as its replacement. Initially representing only European unions, after World War II the federation began admitting unions from around the world. The large majority of workers represented worked in banking, insurance, or as clerical staff in commerce and social services. In 1984, the International Secretariat of Entertainment Trade Unions became an autonomous section of the FIET. By 1994, membership of FIET had reached 11 million.

Throughout his adult life he liked to see himself as a \\"language therapist\\". \\"Human speech seems to have been encoded, sealed into formulaic structures, and pressed into service for mechanistic operations\\" (\\"Menschliche Rede scheint chiffriert worden zu sein, versiegelt in Formeln, hineingepreßt in mechanische Funktionen\\"), he once wrote.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Gerhard Storz was born in Rottenacker, a village along the upper reaches of the Danube in the hills to the south west of Ulm. Otto Storz (1857–1942), his father, was a Lutheran pastor who was assigned to a succession of parishes in the area during Gerhard's childhood. His paternal grandmother had been a great grand daughter of the philosopher Jacob Friedrich von Abel, known to literature scholars as a teacher and friend of Friedrich Schiller. He attended school at Ehingen and then between 1916 and 1918, served as a volunteer in the wartime army. He attended Tübingen University between 1919 and 1922, studying Classical philology, Archaeology, Philosophy and Germanistics. He received his doctorate for a dissertation entitled \\"The linguistic presentation of the concept of truth in Greek literature before Plato\\" (\\"Die sprachliche Darstellung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der griechischen Literatur vor Plato\\"). The work was supervised by Wilhelm Schmid. As a student Storz was a member of the Tübinger Königsgesellschaft Roigel, the university's prestigious student fraternity. Meanwhile he passed his level 1 teaching exams in 1922 and his level 2 teaching exams in 1923.In parallel to all this he managed to find time to study stagecraft at a drama school. = Theatre = Although his education had prepared him, principally, for a career as a teacher, it was now the theatre to which he turned for the next few years. He worked at the Württembergische Volksbühne Theatre in Stuttgart as an actor-producer (\\"Oberspielleiter\\") between 1923 and 1925. He then moved to the Badisches Staatstheater (subsequently rebuilt) in Karlsruhe where he stayed till 1927 before moving on again, this time to the National Theatre Mannheim. In 1931 he took a senior post as a producer-director at the Stadttheater in Saarbrücken and in 1934/35 he moved north to the Stadttheater in Dortmund = Teacher = By this time his theatre career had become a part-time one. In 1932 he entered the schools service, becoming a teaching assistant (\\"Studienassessor\\") at a secondary school in Biberach. After the conclusion of his theatre career, in 1935 Stolz moved to Schwäbisch Hall, where he took a position at the \\"Gymnasium bei St. Michael\\" (secondary school) as a teacher of German and Latin. He remained at the school till 1943, described during this period by his son as \\"a committed teacher, a convinced humanist and a secret opponent of National Socialism\\", able to conduct discrete but regular \\"reality checks\\" with his fellow intellectual and friend, Dolf Sternberger, who was also secretly opposed to the Nazi project. In January 1933 the Nazis had taken power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. On 1 June 1933 Gerhard Storz became a member of the party sponsored Nazi Teachers' Association (\\"Nationalsozialistische Lehrerbund\\" / NSLB). This would have been seen as a necessary precondition for a career switch into the schools sector. It was also in 1935 that Stolz's first marriage ended in divorce after seven years. Martha married Pavel Hackel the next year, and the couple had to leave German \\"for political reasons\\". They would live in exile in South Africa till 1960 Gerhard Schorz would remarry only in 1944. Not for the first time, Storz sustained a parallel second career, writing for the Frankfurter Zeitung (newspaper) between 1935 and 1943, when after the withdrawal of government support and several years of declining readership the newspaper was suppressed. Around this time his second marriage broke up. By 1943 the invasion of the Soviet Union was faltering and the tide of the war had turned against Germany. The government responded in February 1943 with a public declaration of \\"total war\\". Despite his age Storz was conscripted for military service. War ended and in November 1945 he was able to return from war service and imprisonment. He returned to the school in Schwäbisch Hall where he had been teaching before his conscription: in 1947 he was appointed school director (head). Characteristically, for much of this time he also help a position as director of studies at the newly established teacher training academy housed in the former monastery on the Comburg (hill) on the north side of the town. = Politics = Storz also had contacts in the world of politics. In Schwäbisch Hall he became a local councillor. He was a founder member of the CDU (party). and one of the founders of a local CDU branch. During the years of occupation he demonstrated personal commitment to constructing a democratic future for Germany. In 1958 he accepted an invitation from Minister-president Gebhard Müller to join the regional government of Baden-Württemberg. The state had only come into being in 1952 as the consequence of a merger of three smaller federal states established by the US military administration in the immediate aftermath of the war. As Minister for Culture in a recently formed state Storz oversaw a major reform programme of the secondary schools. He expanded the network of education colleges and involved himself in plans for the (re-)establishment, during the 1960s, of universities in Konstanz in Ulm. However, he resigned his office in 1964, a couple of years before the new universities opened their doors. Following his retirement from the political front-line Storz became an honorary professor at his alma mater. He also accepted guest professorships in the United States, notably at Middlebury, Vermont (1963) and Kansas, Lawrence (1965). Between 1966 and 1972 he served as president of the Darmstadt-based German Academy for Language and Literature (\\"Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung\\") (of which he had been a member since its foundation in 1949). Within the Academy he consistently opposed the more radical proposals for spelling reform \\"Rechtschreibung\\" that were already appearing on the political agenda in the 1950s. (The Academy has continued to resist successive \\"Rechtschreibung\\" proposals since his departure.)  Output  From as early 1927 Gerhard Storz was a writer of scholarly and literary pieces and a compiler of translations. Between 1948 and 1968 he collaborated with Fritz Martini, Friedrich Maurer and Robert Ulshöfer to produce the academic journal, \\"Der Deutschunterricht\\" (loosely: \\"Teaching German\\"). Between 1945 and 1948 he joined with Dolf Sternberger and Wilhelm E. Süskind to provide contributions to Die Wandlung (loosely \\"The Changeling\\" in a series which later appeared as a book under the title \\"From the Dictionary of Inhumanity\\" (\\"Aus dem Wörterbuch des Unmenschen\\"), analysing the changes and manipulations of the German language implemented by the National Socialists. =Standalone pieces (selection) = * Das Theater in der Gegenwart.

He is known for the Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca, the Hotel de México, and the adjacent Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros. Early years (1896–1919) Manuel Suárez y Suárez was born on 23 March 1896 in Téifaros, from Navia, Asturias. He was the second son of a family of ten. His parents were cousins, Balbina Suárez Rodríguez of Téifaros and Manuel Suárez Fernández of Loredo, Villayón. They grew potatoes and grain, and had two cows and a donkey. He received a basic education in the village school, and acquired a love of books. Manuel's older brother Joaquin moved to Mexico to work on the dairy farm of his uncle Joaquín Rodríguez y García Loredo, but when he arrived found his uncle had died. Joaquin became a clerk at the wholesale grain merchant Casa Peral Alverde and saved up to fund Manuel's journey to Mexico. In the spring of 1911 at the age of 15 Manuel emigrated to Mexico. He was hired by the Casa Peral Alvede to travel through the north and center of Mexico buying crops. In May 1914 he was captured by the insurgents under Pancho Villa. He was almost shot, but then was made a lieutenant colonel and served on Villa's general staff for almost a year before being given leave to return to Mexico City. The Suárez brothers prospered and were able to bring their three younger brothers to join them. From 1918 to 1919 Manuel studied at the School of Commerce in Gijón. Inter-war period (1919–42) In 1919 Manuel and Joachim Suárez left the Casa Peral Alverde and founded the La Mexicana grocery store in the La Merced neighborhood of Mexico City. In 1923 Manuel left this business and founded a building supply company named Eureka in partnership with the son of Plutarco Elías Calles, the future President of Mexico. He later became the sole owner of this business. He undertook contracts to build infrastructure for the states' improvemement boards (Juntas De Mejoras). Part of his fortune came from buying land at low cost in places such as Acapulco, Nogales, Veracruz, Manzanillo, Tijuana, Laredo and Ciudad Juarez that he later sold after these communities started to develop. Fragment of the mural \\"La Hispanidad\\" by Josep Renau, salvaged from the Casino de la Selva The first constitutional governor of Morelos state, Vicente Estrada Cajigal(es), authorized construction of a casino complex in Cuernavaca by the Compañía Hispanoamericana de Hoteles. This was a consortium of Mexican businessmen backed by President Abelardo L. Rodríguez. Suárez was the building contractor. The Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station. It was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in Tehuacán in 1934. However, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders. Suárez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934. That year the new president Lázaro Cárdenas took office. One of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice. Suárez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel. Suárez and the Valencian architect Jesús Martí Martín founded the company Vías y Obras (Roads and Works), which built facilities in the ports of Veracruz, Acapulco and other cities. In 1936 Suárez bought the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz. That year he went to Italy to buy machinery for Eureka. He had trouble with the authorities of the Mussolini regime, who seized a cross of diamonds and pearls he had bought for one of his daughters, and from then on was opposed to Italian Fascism. However, he supported General Francisco Franco with supplies during the Spanish Civil War. Between 1936 and 1941 he invested in sugar mills in Sonora, Oaxaca, Tepic and Sinaloa. Years of prosperity (1942–66) Dining room in front of the auditorium at Casino de la Selva During World War II (1939–45) Mexico declared war on the Axis in 1942. Suárez helped develop the system of replacing imports by local production. He said later that President Manuel Ávila Camacho (1940–46) offered to make him Minister of the Economy three times, but he refused on the basis that business should be separate from politics. Suárez was also a close friend of President Miguel Alemán Valdés (1946–52), who promoted development of tourism. He loved art, and promoted the career of contemporary artists such as Dr. Atl (Gerardo Murillo), David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jorge González Camarena, José Reyes Meza, Francisco Icaza and Josep Renau. Suárez wanted the Casino de la Selva to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens. He hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as José Reyes Meza and Josep Renau to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age. The murals would cover an area of . The hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists. At the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers Félix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium at the Casino de la Selva, and a non- denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs. Félix Candela's pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda(fr), designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction. Later the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo. The dining room, the Salón de los Relojes (Salon of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected showing the times of places around the world. The auditorium, reached via the Salón de los Relojes, had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural La farándula (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist Francisco Icaza, a tribute to the German playwright Bertolt Brecht. World Trade Center, Mexico Last years (1966–87) Suárez opened three restaurants in Mexico City, and in 1966 embarked on building the Gran Hotel de México (now the World Trade Center). Suarez conceived the idea of building a major business and tourist complex named Mexico 2000, centered around the huge Hotel de México. From the 1970s until his death he put most of his energy into the project, which grew out of control. The hotel was to be the largest in the Americas, high with 1,500 rooms. It was to be 51 stories high with 1,508 hexagonal rooms that could house 3,100 guests. A panoramic elevator would be able to carry 100 tourists, and 19 other elevators for normal passengers, and there would be one covered and one open air panoramic terrace. A heliport would be equipped with customs. There would be four cafeterias and six restaurants, with a revolving restaurant on the top floor, five reception halls, a 3000-person convention room, a spiral-shaped shopping mall, a theatre, museum and so on. The building was unfinished when Suarez died, and remained an unfinished skeleton for many years. The Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros was built in the grounds of the hotel, with murals by the painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. It was started early in the 1970s and completed before Siqueiros died in 1974. The building's exterior is a dodecahedron, while the interior is an octagon. It was built by the architects Guillermo Rossell de la Lama, Ramón Miquela Jáuregui and Joaquín Álvarez Ordonéz. Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, with statue of Sigueros and Suárez in front Suárez built a workshop for Siqueiros in Cuernavaca, La Tallera, to help him work as efficiently as possible. The Polyforum has twelve huge exterior panels holding murals by Siqueros that depict the March of Humanity, showing the evolution from the past to the present and giving a view of the future. Most of the other surfaces of the building were also painted by Siqueros, making the building's exterior the largest mural in the world. The exterior mural covers over and depicts the march of humanity on Earth towards the Cosmos. The interior depicts the march of humanity in Latin America. Most of the murals of the Polyforum were taken from drawings that Siqueros made while in prison for his revolutionary opinions in 1960–64. Death and legacy Don Manuel Suárez died in Mexico City in 1987 at the age of 91. He was buried in the pantheon of Santa Cruz del Pedregal. Suárez amassed a collection of around 4,000 paintings. The Museo Mural Diego Rivera holds 50 pieces from his huge collection. He married twice and had twenty children: Manuel, Sergio, José, Jorge, Miguel Angel, Carlos, Lilia, Raquel, Silvia, Marisol, Margarita, Maricarmen, Concepción, Alfredo, Marcos, Manuel, Angélica, Beatriz, Ernesto and Fernando. In August 1987 it was reported that Hyatt would lend $30 million to the Suárez Group to complete the first 400 rooms on the ten highest levels of his hotel for what would now be called the Hotel de México Hyatt. Eventually the Hotel de México was converted into the World Trade Center, an office building, in 1995. In July 2005 the World Trade Center was sold at auction for $58 million by the government's Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro (Fobaproa). The Casino de la Selva was demolished in the fall of 2002 and replaced by two large box stores.

His rule led to the fall of Kazakh Khanate's dominance since the reign of Kasym Khan. Biography =Early years= Taiyr was the eldest son of Adik who was the most influential Kazakh sultan and the grandson of Janibek Khan, the co- founder of Kazakh Khanate. Taiyr Khan ascended to the throne after a short reign and the death of Mamash Khan. Taiyr was happy and easygoing. He, as a descendant of Genghis Khan, by birthright acquired the title of Sultan and with him as well as all the rights and benefits. Like most young sultans of the Khanate, Taiyr studied at school, most likely in Tashkent, where his parents lived for a long time. But he always differed himself from others with a difficult personality. According to the witness of Mirza Haydar, who knew Taiyr well, by his nature, he was an evil, cruel person and extremely suspicious. Being at the top pyramid of his country. =Reign= With the death of Mamash Khan in 1523, the era of consolidation ended and the era of great sharing which involving almost all Sultan surnames of the khanate, sharing power, ulus people, pastures, etc. Taiyr was accompanied by luck, and in a sharp rivalry with the sultans from other families he gained the upper hand and became a Khan. In 1522-1523, the ruler of Khanate of Bukhara, Kochkunju Muhammad, fought a war against the Kazakhs and won. Everything that Taiyr Khan did for himself was difficult and all his promises were unsuccessful. He had neither diplomatic nor military skills, as evidenced by his repeated military defeats and diplomatic setbacks. Tyrant by nature, Taiyr became a culprit after the death of his brother Abu-l-Qasim. Not only that, Taiyr expressed himself to natural impulses and continued to live casually. These outcomes began immediately affecting him. Even in the winter of 1523-1524, part of the Kazakhs had already begun to disobey him. By the middle of 1526, Taiyr Khan's activities became very insufficient, and his cruelty and suspicion had severed. As a result, the enlightened sultans even turned away from him. Taiyr Khan was one of the first Kazakh rulers to enter a war with the Kalmaks. He ordered the construction of the Jatan fortress at the bottom of one mountain in order to repulse the Kalmak troops. In 1537-1538, when the Khan of the Moghuls, Abd al-Rashid, who was allied with Shaybanids went to war against the Kazakh Khanate, the Kazakhs managed to defended themselves in the fortress. The exact location of where the Jatan fort once stood is currently unknown. In his final years, Taiyr, who had failed at the same time as in anticipation, provoking general hatred by his government, hid himself from other people and died with the Kyrgyz in misery.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Old West Side contains a range of architecture and streetscapes that are especially characteristic of 19th century midwestern America. In 1967, the non-profit Old West Side Association was formed to promote neighborhood conservation. Description left The Old West Side contains primarily small, one family homes located on tree-lined streets. These houses are typically two stories in height with six or seven rooms. About 85% of the houses are of frame construction, and the majority are clad with clapboard. Also included are houses with shingled or stuccoed exteriors, and about 15% of the houses are brick. Many of the houses have front gabled roofs and a wide pillared front porch. The larger houses, predominantly along West Liberty, in the neighborhood are generally irregular in plan, have additional side porches, and contain more architectural detail and elaborate ornamentation. The neighborhood contains nearly every prominent architectural style used in the period 1860-1914. is represented in the Old West Side. These most prevalent styles include Italian villas, Queen Anne ornamental houses, classic revival houses, small plain New England and colonial revival styles. The neighborhood also includes Gothic cottages, Colonial and Georgian revival mansions, American picturesque, Tudor, stick, mansard and \\"carpenter's delight\\" houses, along with houses that are an eclectic mixture. History In 1845, William Maynard purchased a large parcel of the land just west Ann Arbor and began subdividing dividing it into lots. Maynard's property includes most of what is the historic district today. The new section attracted many of the German immigrant population that had settled in and near Ann Arbor. In the years following the Civil War, the local economy boomed, with industries starting up and attracting workers, many of whom filled up the lots in Maynard's subdivision. The neighborhood was settled, with houses being built on lots up through World War I. However, after World War II, the Old West Side began to decline. Many of the houses were old, and the residents were moving out into newer homes.

She is the former organist at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City (1990-2003), the first female organist to hold that post. She was also organist for the Paul Winter Consort at the Cathedral's Easter and Christmas services and performed with the ensemble on their Grammy Award-winning album Silver Solstice, released in 2005. In 2005, Papadakos co-produced Pompeii the Musical, for which she wrote the book, music and lyrics. Its production was well-received, breaking box office records when it premiered in Wilmington, North Carolina. In 2017, her first novel, The Kingdom of Winter, was published. Using fantasy characters to address climate change concerns, the book is now used in a science and literature curriculum for middle-school students. Early years Papadakos was born in 1960, the daughter of actress Dorothy M. Johnson and Greek-American aeronautical designer Peter J. Papadakos. As a child, she began studying piano while living with her family in Reno, Nevada, and soon became interested in jazz and improvisation. She attended Reno High School. After graduating from Barnard College in 1982, Papadakos earned a master's degree in Organ Performance at the Juilliard School in 1988. In 1984, she began studying improvisation with Paul Halley and, in 1987, became Halley's assistant organist at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.  Career = Cathedral organist (1990-2003) = In 1990, Paul Halley resigned as organist of New York City's Cathedral of St. John the Divine to pursue his solo career. Papadakos, who had been Halley's assistant, succeeded him as Cathedral Organist, becoming the first woman to be appointed organist at the largest Gothic-style cathedral in the world. The vast expanse of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine - organ pipes visible above both sides of Choir As organist at the Episcopalian edifice, Papadakos eschewed a staid, conservative style of music-making in favor of a creative, improvisational approach. Her playing, said the New York Times, imparts \\"jazz, African rhythms and real heart to centuries-old hymns\\". She also had to cope with the acoustic challenges of playing in such an immense space, with an eight-second reverberation time, as she demonstrated to a Smithsonian magazine reporter in 1997. When she returned to Reno, Nevada, for a performance in 1995, a Reno Gazette-Journal critic called her a \\"sensational organist\\" and \\"among the toasts of Manhattan\\". Papadakos also accompanied the Paul Winter Consort at the Cathedral's Easter and Christmas services. She later performed with the ensemble on three of their recordings, including the Grammy Award- winning album Silver Solstice, released in 2005. In the wake of the catastrophic September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in Manhattan, Papadakos performed in \\"An Evening of Peace\\" gathering at nearby Riverside Church, joining such luminaries as Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh, Judy Collins, and Paul Winter. The concert's theme was criticized afterwards by Kay S. Hymowitz and Harry Stein, writing in the Wall Street Journal. The columnists decried what they called \\"multiculturalism, the enemy within,\\" saying it was at variance with the majority of American opinion favoring a sustained military response. On the morning of December 18, 2001, a five-alarm fire began in the Cathedral's gift shop, located in the north transept. Although the Great Organ's oak casework and its thousands of pipes were not consumed by the conflagration, the organ console and pipes were blanketed in ash and soot, rendering the instrument unplayable. Undaunted, Papadakos carried on as organist for the throngs attending the church's popular Christmas services, playing a digital 3-manual organ, provided by the Allen Organ Company, so Cathedral Christmas services could proceed. She continued as Cathedral organist until 2003. = Playwright = After visiting the ruins of Pompeii in Italy, Papadakos began writing a stage play about life in the ancient Roman city that ended in 79 AD with the cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. The resulting Pompeii: The Musical premiered in November, 2005, in Wilmington, North Carolina. After opening night at the Thalian Center for the Performing Arts, successor to historic Thalian Hall, the performances were sold out for its two-week run, breaking 150-year old box office records as more than six thousand attended, forcing the theatre to open its rarely used third tier for overflow seating. Pompeii, later re-titled BACCHUS, also won Encore Magazine’s \\"Best Theatre Production of 2006\\" Award. = Silent film accompanist = Papadakos makes frequent appearances providing improvised organ music to accompany silent film screenings, a genre she began to play at the Cathedral when asked to fill in as a last-minute substitute for theater organist Lee Erwin. In the early 2000s, Papadakos started her annual Halloween Horror Tour, which brings silent film's classics, such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Phantom of the Opera to life on the world’s pipe organs. Her silent film appearances have included such classics as a rendition of the Hunchback of Notre Dame at a New Year's Eve 2011 celebration at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, and Nosferatu at Kansas City's Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts organ in 2014. Explaining her fondness for silent movie accompaniment, Papadakos told an interviewer: = Author = Papadakos published a novel about climate change and its effect on Earth's seasons, entitled The Kingdom of Winter, in 2017. Using fictional characters, such as the wicked \\"Fire Witch\\", to portray global warming, the book seeks to present these issues in an understandable fantasy appealing to a broad audience. Well received by the climate science community and STEM teachers, it was turned into a Science and Literature curriculum for middle school students, The Kingdom of Winter, A Curriculum Guide by science educator Joshua Hunter and was endorsed by the International Honor Society in Education. Personal life Papadakos is married to landscape designer Tracy McCullen. The New York Times reported that their wedding, held at the Cathedral on May 20, 2000, had Renaissance musicians and costumed ushers. In 2003, Papadakos left New York and the Cathedral for the couple's home near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.

Early life  Zhurkina was born on 28 August 1920 to a working-class Russian family in Turinsk. Before joining the military in 1942 she studied at the Moscow Law Institute and had graduated from flight courses at the Moscow Aeroclub where she became certified to pilot a Po-2. After both of her brothers who were in the military died in combat shortly after the start of the war and inspired by the leadership of Marina Raskova she sought to join the military. In 1944 she became a member of the Communist Party.Журнал «Авиация и космонавтика», 1968, № 3  Military career  Not long after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Zhurkina joined the Red Army in 1942 and worked at an interception station but requested to be retrained as an air-gunner in 1943. Her regimental commander approved the transfer and after only a few days of training she had become skilled in the use of the aircraft's machine gun. She soon saw her baptism by fire in the Battle of Kursk, providing information on the locations and movements of enemy tank units and troop formations in addition to providing cover for Soviet ground troops by fending off enemy aircraft. On 23 July 1943 she opened fire on two FW-190 fighters to defend the plane during a reconnaissance mission. As a result, they were able to report on the movement of troops in the Orel area. After her first five sorties she was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\", as she had often found herself shooting at enemy planes while transmitting reconnaissance information. From 4 March to 2 April 1944 she flew 23 reconnaissance sorties over the Pskov Oblast, Pushkinskiye Gory, Opochka, and Idritsa, in which she took photographs of enemy of facilities, transmitted information from the plane to the ground, and repulsed attacks from nine enemy fighters. For her bravery shown in those actions she was awarded her first Order of Glory on 30 April 1944. From 16 September to October that same year she flew fifteen reconnaissance and bombing sorties over Riga, Tukums, and Klapkalns in Latvia. In those missions she transmitted 93 messages to the ground about enemy positions and the movements of supply shipments, personnel, and aircraft in addition to fending off multiple attacks by enemy fighters. On 15 October she was awarded the Order of Glory in the second class. In November 1944 Zhurkina was assigned the difficult task of photographing enemy defenses over the city of Kuldīga, Latvia. The flight was conducted in poor weather, causing Zhurkina's plane to fly at a dangerously low altitude of 500 meters, where she would face bombardment from Axis artillery fire. After photographing the area and turning back to the airfield Zhurkina's plane was bombarded by four Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters on her third approach, but she managed to fend them off after shooting one down and shooting at another enough that it was forced to turn back from the damage caused. The mission, which involved flying six passes over the military fortifications, was conducted on Pe-2. After the first flyover she fended off two German fighters, but after the second flyover the plane was forced to head back to the airbase before the next flyover. Before the third flyover when she managed to shoot down one fighter, she had suspected that a pair of fighters would attack, one from below and one from above, so she asked the navigator to take control of the upper machine gun while she operated the lower gun. On her first shot she ruptured the fuel tank of a Messerschmitt and shot at another, causing the remaining aircraft to disengage the attack. On a mission on 18 November 1944 she fired upon two planes, fending them off from her plane. For her actions in those engagements she was awarded the Order of Glory 1st class by decree of the Supreme Soviet on 23 February 1948. She was never shot down during the war nor did she sustain any major injuries. In addition to all the Orders of Glory she was also awarded the Order of the Red Star. In total she flew 67 sorties, engaged in 30 dogfights, and shot down one enemy plane.  Later life  After the end of the war she left the military and worked as the personnel director of a clothing factory in Riga. She led an active social life and was a member of \\"War Veterans for Peace\\". After the dissolution of the Soviet Union she moved to Russia and was not able to bring much with her, but did bring all her war photo albums and address book of fellow veterans with her. From then on she lived in a boarding house for veterans of the Second World War in Moscow until she passed away in 2002 at the age of 82.

She was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Lorenzo Dow Mix and Jane Sylvia Gardner. She studied classical music in Cleveland, New York, and Germany, and then pursued a career in journalism. She was a trained classical pianist, and later worked as a music critic for the Toledo Times and book review editor and critic for the Pittsburgh Post. During the 1920s when radio was reaching broad popularity, she was one of only a few female editors covering Radio in journalism, working as an editor at Radio Broadcast (Magazine) from 1924 until her death in April 1925. She authored a column entitled \\"The Listeners' Point of View\\" in Radio Broadcast that discussed radio broadcast programs, especially relating to music. Mix also wrote books on several topics, including a popular novel, At Fame's Gateway; the Romance of a Pianiste, Mighty animals: being short talks about some of the animals which lived on this earth before man appeared,Mighty animals: being short talks about some of the animals which lived on this earth before man appeared and Great pictures and their painters: a series of articles on some of the Medici prints owned by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Mighty Animals was an apparent departure from previous writing topics. It was one of the first texts on paleontology written for children. It includes a foreword by the Director of American Museum of Natural History, Dr. Frederic Lucas. The book discusses various types of extinct animals (primarily dinosaurs), how fossils are formed, and how field work is conducted, and contains numerous illustrations and photographs.

The long main branch runs from the Euclid Creek Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks to Lake Erie. The west (also known as south) branch is usually considered part of the main branch, and extends another to the creek's headwaters in Beachwood, Ohio. The east branch runs for and has headwaters in Willoughby Hills, Ohio. The stream has exposed geologic formations which proved of importance to science, and these formations proved economically important in the Cleveland, Ohio, area in the early and mid 1800s. Five major in-channel obstructions impair the stream, which runs through a heavily urbanized area east of Cleveland. Portions of the creek are culvertized and channelized, and the stream has been heavily polluted in the past. Although the level of pollution has lessened in the last 30 years, the fishery remains significantly impaired. The development of settlements along Euclid Creek is an important part of the history of the development of Cleveland's east side, and some of the major retail developments in the watershed in the past 60 years have impaired the stream. Location and flows Euclid Creek is a stream which originates in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It flows through Cuyahoga County and a small portion of Lake County before emptying into Lake Erie. Euclid Creek is one of about 100 streams that drain directly into the lake. Doan Brook and Euclid Creek are the largest of the minor tributaries of Lake Erie. The stream consists of a main branch, an east branch, and several named and unnamed tributaries. Many sources say that the main branch extends from the mouth of the stream about upstream, where an east branch and west (or south) branch meet. The watershed drained by this segment of the creek is about in size. However, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) treats the main branch and west branch as a single main branch, which is the description used in this article. Upstream from the confluence of the two streams, the main/west branch extends for another and drains a watershed of about . The east branch is long and drains a watershed of about . The main branch and east branch (exclusive of tributaries) are a combined long, with a combined watershed approximately in size. More than 100 streams make up the headwaters of Euclid Creek. The Euclid Creek watershed is one of the most highly urbanized areas of the Lake Erie coastline in Ohio. The watershed contains 11 cities, 10 of which are in Cuyahoga County. About 68,000 people live in the watershed. Euclid Creek has an average grade of , or 1.04 percent, a very high gradient for a stream. The gradient varies from place to place along the creek. Near its headwaters, the grade is , while within the Euclid Reservation Metropark the grade increases to . In the lacustuary near its mouth, the grade is just . =Underlying geology= Euclid Creek near the intersection of Metropark Blvd. and Highland Road in 1913. The creek has exposed about of the Chagrin Shale, topped by about of the Cleveland Shale. Euclid Creek flows over bedrock more than 360 million years old. This includes the 365 million year old Chagrin Shale, the 360 million year old Cleveland Shale, the 358.9 million year old Bedford Formation, the 360 million year old Berea Sandstone, and the 354.8 to 351.4 million year old Orangeville Shale of the Cuyahoga Formation. The Berea Sandstone is highly resistant to erosion, and the highest waterfalls on Euclid Creek occur where the stream has cut down to the Berea. Topographically, the underlying geology creates three distinct areas: The Allegheny Plateau, the Portage Escarpment, and the Erie Plain. The headwaters of both the main and east branch are located on the Allegheny Plateau. The two streams descend over the steep terraces of the Portage Escarpment before reaching the relatively flat Erie Plain and draining into Lake Erie. The Late stage of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age) began about 85,000 years ago, and in Ohio reached as far south as the Portage Escarpment before stopping. This ice sheet not only shaped the relief of the land—leaving behind low rounded hills, irregular plains, and depressions that turned into wetlands—but also left glacial till and erratics over most of the bedrock. A low morainic ridge, the Euclid Moraine, appears east of Euclid Creek. This morainic ridge extends to Willoughby, Ohio, from Euclid Creek. A portion of the east branch flows along the south edge of this moraine. =Fossils= The Chagrin Shale exposed by Euclid Creek contains many different arthropod fossils, including Camarotoechia, Lingula, Nucleata, Orbiculoidea, and five species of Echinocaris. A lone fossil of a decapod, Palaeopalaemon, and indeterminate fragments of the crustacean Mesothyra, have also been found. In 1960, a new species of lobe-finned fish, Chagrinia enodis, was found eroded out of the Chagrin Shale in the Euclid Creek Reservation. The Cleveland Shale along Euclid Creek is known to contain limited fossil remains. Fragments of what may be the plant Sporangites have been identified. Brachiopod fossils by be found in some places in the formation's topmost layers. These are generally Lingula and Orbiculoidea, although on very rare occasions other species may be found. Another fossil, once believed to be the arthropod Spathiocaris but in 2017 reinterpreted to be an ammonoid aptychus, may also be found. Fossil fish teeth, scales, and sometimes bones or armor are the most frequent fossils found. A review in 2008 identified 65 vertebrate taxa, represented primarily by Chondrichthyes (32 species), Placodermi (28 species), and Osteichthyes (five species). Where exposed by Euclid Creek, the Bedford Shale usually contains an extensive fossil record in its bottommost part. These include brachiopods like Lingula, Orbiculoidea, and the large Syringothyris bedfordensis; mollusks, particularly bivalves; and Devonian fish. =Main Branch= Confluence of the main branch (left) and east branch of Euclid Creek in the Euclid Creek Reservation The Geographic Names Information System of the United States Geological Survey places the headwaters of the main/west branch of Euclid Creek between Fairmount Blvd. and Fairwood Court in Beachwood, Ohio (). The Division of Surface Water of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency places the headwaters roughly to the north, on the Acacia Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks in Lyndhurst, Ohio (). Both are at an elevation of above mean sea level. This is an area of hummocks and knolls with soil that ranges from poorly drained to moderately well drained. Soil permeability is slow to moderately slow. The main branch of Euclid Creek gently meanders over a nearly level plateau through the cities of Lyndhurst, Mayfield Heights, Richmond Heights, South Euclid, and Euclid. Soil permeability improves in Richmond Heights, South Euclid, and Euclid, ranging from moderately slow to moderately rapid. After passing down the Portage Escarpment, the stream flows across the loamy, fine-sand, lacustrine sediment of the Erie Plain. Here the soil is moderately well drained and rapidly permeable. Much of the main branch's streambed was determined by the Wisconsin glaciation. The main branch passes through some of the most densely urbanized land in Cuyahoga County. There is little remaining floodplain or intact stream banks. Poor soil permeability for much of the stream's length and the extensive impervious surfaces of the urban landscape contribute to flash flood-like stream flows. These flows inhibit the quantity and diversity of fish and aquatic insect populations. Where it drops over the Portage Escarpment, the main branch has carved a long gorge. At the head (south end) of the gorge, at what is now the intersection of E. Green Road and Anderson Road, the stream tumbles over a waterfall. The gorge is to deep and an average of wide. Euclid Creek meanders across the flat bottom of the gorge, where it has carved a channel deep into the alluvial soil and the shale rock. Although the depth of Euclid Creek in the gorge is usually no more than ankle- to knee-deep, the stream has eroded a few deep potholes in the shale streambed, some up to deep. Emerging from this gorge about where Euclid Avenue and Chardon Road meet today, the creek meanders across the Erie Plain, a relatively flat area with low, rolling hills. It has carved a channel wide and deep in the Erie Plain. The mouth of Euclid Creek is located on Lake Erie at , above mean sea level. =East Branch= The headwaters of the east branch of Euclid Creek are located near Interstate 271, about south of 32500 Chardon Road in Willoughby Hills, Ohio (). The elevation at these headwaters is about above mean sea level. The east branch joins the main/west branch of the stream in the Euclid Creek Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks about south- southeast of the intersection of Highland Road and Metropark Drive (). The elevation at the confluence of the two branches is about . From its headwaters, the east branch flows mostly along an east-west roughly paralleling the Portage Escarpment in a deep ravine. Although the stream banks are nearly all intact and the ravine eliminates any chance for a floodplain, nearly all the tributaries of the east branch have been channelized, culvertized, and lost their floodplain due to urban development. Watershed Euclid Creek watershed The Euclid Creek watershed is almost unique among Ohio streams in that it contains no agricultural land and is more than 80 percent developed. The undeveloped land is projected to become built up within the next few decades by light industrial, office, residential, and retail construction. Residential development is likely to be apartment buildings or clustered townhouses, keeping with a national trend away from single-family homes. This will put new pressure on the water quality of Euclid Creek. Cuyahoga County Airport is the largest landowner within the watershed. Six east branch tributaries travel through, under, or adjacent to the airport's . About of Euclid Creek's watershed is protected. This includes the of the Lower Euclid Creek Reservation and of the Euclid Creek Reservation. The combined reservation is one of the most heavily-used parks in the Cleveland Metroparks system. Weekend use in the summer routinely exceeds park capacity, causing compaction of soil, litter, and illegal dumping. The Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District owns two conservation easements (totaling ) covering the headwaters of Euclid Creek in Lyndhurst and Mayfield. The city of Richmond Heights owns a conservation easement over the ravine and wetlands of Verbsky Creek, and has imposed an environmental deed restriction over Claribel Creek between Richmond Heights City Hall and Richmond Heights Community Park. Few wetlands remain in the Euclid Creek watershed. Notable wetlands exist adjacent to Highland Heights Community Park, at the headwaters of a major tributary of the east branch; the Acacia Reservation; and portions of the floodplain of the east branch. The health of these wetlands is not known. =Subwatersheds= The stream's watershed has seven distinctive subwatersheds. These are: Subwatershed 1: Erie Plains in the Nottingham neighborhood—This area contains of the main branch stream, between Lake Erie/Lower Euclid Creek Reservation and the Euclid Creek Reservation. About 6 percent of this area is undeveloped, and more than 25 percent is covered with impervious surfaces such as parking lots or buildings. The Lake Erie coastline and Euclid Creek lacustuary have been highly modified to accommodate bathing beaches, marinas, onshore developments, parks, piers, and other developments and uses. Marshlands and an oxbow have been removed, although partial floodplain and stream restoration have occurred. Between the park and Interstate 90, Euclid Creek is highly channelized, although a riparian zone exists on either side that shields the stream from the dense urban development adjacent to it. At Villaview Road, the stream enters a long tunnel that takes it beneath Interstate 90. It briefly emerges at E. 185th Street, where the St. Clair Spillway helps keep stream velocity low. The creek then enters a short tunnel to pass beneath the CSX railroad tracks. Between the railroad tracks and the Euclid Creek Reservation, much of Euclid Creek runs in a concrete channel completed as part of a flood control project. Shoaling (the accumulation of debris and sediment) has worsened in this area, reducing the effectiveness of the flood control measure. Extensive illegal dumping occurs in the creek between Lakeshore Blvd. and the Euclid Creek Reservation. Subwatershed 2: Euclid Creek Reservation—This area contains of the main branch stream and tributaries in the Euclid Creek Reservation. About 20 percent of this area is undeveloped, with 11 to 15 percent covered with impervious surfaces such as building rooftops, lawns, and parking lots. The watershed here is largely natural, and is enclosed in a deep, broad valley whose walls are mostly bedrock. Limited illegal dumping occurs in the park, and the creek's water quality is affected by polluted surface runoff from nearby residential areas after heavy storms. Verbsky Creek, a roughly long tributary, joins the east branch just before the east branch's confluence with the main branch. It runs west of Highland Road, crossing to the east of the street about east of the intersection of Georgetown Road and Hilltop Road. It crosses Highland Road again and turns south between Highland Ridge Drive and Donna Drive, passing through and under residential developments. Redstone Run, a stream, joins Verbsky Creek just before Verbsky Creek crosses east of Highland Road. It travels east-southeast through a heavily forested ravine bordered by housing developments before turning south north of Hillcrest Drive. Flowing through a series of culverts, tunnels, and open ditches, it crosses Highland Road just west of Karl Drive, flows southeast for about , turns south and runs between Harris Drive and Catlin Drive for about , then runs southeast to just north of the intersection of Jefferson Lane and Monticello Place. It then travels east to Richmond Road, where its headwaters formerly began beneath what is now Richmond Town Square mall. Subwatershed 3: Lower East Branch—This area contains of the east branch stream and four tributaries in the cities of Richmond Heights and Highland Heights. About 23 percent of this area is undeveloped, with 11 to 25 percent covered with impervious surfaces. Euclid Creek flows through a ravine with steep hillsides in this subwatershed, which has largely discouraged alterations to the stream, banks, and adjacent riparian areas. Residential development in this subwatershed consists primarily of single-family homes on large lots, which has kept impervious surfaces and population impacts low. There is some water quality impairment due to illegal dumping (primarily along Chardon Road), septic system overflows, impervious surface runoff, and poor land management (primarily erosion and fertilizer-based pollutants). A weir dam and pond obstructs the east branch west of Bishop Road. Stevenson Brook, a long tributary, enters the east branch north of the end of Balmoral Drive. It travels largely south-southeast through a deep and heavily forested ravine, paralleling Balmoral Drive and then Douglas Blvd., before turning southeast and crossing Highland Road via a culvert at Snavely Road. The stream continues southeast in an open channel until it crosses Richmond Road north of Foxlair Trail. It travels largely east to begin in a retention pond north of Loxley Drive. The ravine adjacent to Douglas Blvd. contains a masonry dam, behind which is a small, silted-up lake. The remains of several other dam structures exist on Stevenson Brook downstream of this dam, and there may be remains of gristmills or sawmills as well. Claribel Creek, a long tributary, enters the east branch northwest of the end of Country Lane. It largely parallels Royal Oak and Cary Jay Blvds., flowing southeast and then south. Southeast of the intersection of Euclid Chagrin Parkway and Cary Jay Blvd., the Mayfair Dam impounds the Mayfair Lake. At the southern end of the lake, the stream runs through a series of channels and culverts and turns southeast and then east- southeast, crossing Highland Road east of the intersection with Richmond Park East. It then turns southeast and then south, running between Charles Place and Sunbury Drive. A small tributary enters the east branch south of Edgemont Road, moving south between Knollwood and Bridgeport Trails and passing through a heavily wooded area south of Allendale Road before turning east to cross Richmond Road and enter the grounds of the Cuyahoga County Airport. Another tributary joins the east branch to the east of the eastern end of Brushview Drive. It travels southeast and is impeded by two weir dams before crossing White Road east of Patricia Drive. It travels south-southeast through the Cuyahoga County Airport grounds before crossing Bishop Road north of Euclid Chagrin Parkway. It continues in a largely southern direction to terminate northeast of the intersection of Bishop Road and Canterbury Lane. These three large and two small tributaries originate in broad, shallow streambeds on the Appalachian Plateau, then enter deep valleys as they come down the Portage Escarpment. Upper portions of the tributaries tend to be heavily impacted by development, while the lower portions are not. Near the headwaters of Euclid Creek at 1 David Myers Parkway in Beachwood, Ohio Subwatershed 4: Upper East Branch—This area contains of the east branch stream and four tributaries in the cities of Highland Heights and Willoughby Hills. About 17 percent of this area is undeveloped, and about 11 to 25 percent is covered with impervious surfaces. Although channelization, culvertization, stream straightening, and other changes have been made to them, some portions of the tributaries retain their natural channels, banks, and floodplains. Subwatershed 5: Upper East Branch/Chagrin Plateau—This area contains of the east branch in the cities of Highland Heights, Willoughby Hills, and Mayfield Heights. About 25 percent of this area is undeveloped, and about 10 to 20 percent is covered with impervious surfaces. Heavily channelized, sometimes in a concrete streambed, Euclid Creek's east branch forms just west of Interstate 271. Subwatershed 6: Highlands—This area contains of the main branch in the cities of Lyndhurst and Mayfield Heights. About 3 percent of this area is undeveloped, and is more than 25 percent covered with impervious surfaces. This subwatershed includes a large unnamed tributary of Euclid Creek, which enters the main branch near the north end of Euclid Creek Reservation. All but the last of the tributary have been buried in tunnels, culvertized, and channelized. The last portion, south of Edenhurst Road, remains largely natural. Subwatershed 7: Headwaters—This area contains of the main branch in the cities of South Euclid, Lyndhurst, and Beachwood. About 7 percent of this area is undeveloped, and it is 10 to 25 percent covered with impervious surfaces. This subwatershed is highly residential. Channelization using gabions is common in the residential areas, although a few floodplains remain north of Mayfield Road. The stream maintains its natural state as it passes through the Mayfield Sand Ridge Club (a private golf course) and through the Acacia Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks. A culvert allows the creek to pass beneath Mayfield Road Upstream of the Acacia Reservation, the headwaters are extremely channelized, culvertized, and contained in a man-made streambed. =Dams and in-channel obstructions= There were five dams on Euclid Creek as of 2017. None of them generate power or provide flood control, and all of them impede the movement of fish and aquatic resources vital to the health of Euclid Creek. The dams are: *St. Clair Spillway—This high concrete spillway impedes the migration of fish on Euclid Creek, and has negatively affected the habitat around it. *David Myers Parkway Dam—This high concrete weir dam helps reduce the velocity of the stream as it passes between David Myers Parkway and the parking lot of The Hamptons apartment complex (west of the creek). *Mayfair Dam—This dam, located at 25959 Highland Road in Richmond Heights at the site of the former Mayfair Tennis and Swim Club, impounds the Mayfair Lake. A pipe acts as a spillway to permit water from the lake to continue down Euclid Creek. Since at least 1988, the lake has been highly eutrophic, and sediment buildup at its southern end has created a shallow delta that limits its use. *Dumbarton Blvd. Dam—This high masonry dam is located about north of the intersection of Dumbarton Blvd. and Douglas Blvd. Built some time in the 1800s, it once impounded a substantial reservoir. It is silted up, and now only a small pond exists. *White Road Dam—This dam impounds roughly of a tributary of the east branch. A causeway, carrying the access driveway to 27511 White Road, is pierced by a culvert. The Euclid Creek Reservation Dam, an high weir dam, was removed in December 2010. This dam helped reduce the velocity of the east branch as it passed beneath the bridge carrying Highland Avenue, significantly reducing the chance of scouring. Another 10 small detention ponds or basins exist within the Euclid Creek watershed. These ponds, which are both publicly and privately owned, are in-line with the stream and provide stormwater overflow control. Another seven to 15 privately-owned, in-line ponds on Euclid Creek provide aesthetic enhancements to landowners. The benefit these provide in terms of water quality and habitat enhancement have not been assessed. Many are filling with sediment. =Culverts and channelization= About (24.18 percent) of Euclid Creek are culverted or contained within a buried tunnel. This includes 9 percent of the main branch downstream of Euclid Creek Reservation, 18 percent of the east branch, and 32 percent of the main/west branch. About (10.9 percent) of Euclid Creek are channelized. Channelization includes armoring (with concrete banks), confining (by making banks higher and more vertical), entrenchment (deepening the channel), gabioning, and straightening. Channelization is intended to prevent flooding during normal precipitation events. However, by confining the stream, channelization also strengthens the velocity of stream flow. This degrades fish and aquatic insect habitat, and worsens erosion and flooding during extreme precipitation events. A 2003 study by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) found that of Euclid Creek showed moderate to high levels of erosion due to channelization. Pollution =Pollution impairment= As early as 1922, scientists determined that Euclid Creek was \\"badly contaminated\\" by raw sewage. Violations of state and federal water quality laws and regulations were common in Euclid Creek throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1977 and 2005, nearly all illegal and illicit industrial sources of pollution were eliminated and most sewage treatment plant discharges. However, pollution control has remained somewhat elusive. A 1986 study found that Euclid Creek from the confluence of the main and east branch north to Lake Erie had poor water quality. The stream had high to extremely high levels of fecal coliform (a harmful, disease-causing bacteria), phenols, total iron, and total lead. The nearshore environment at the mouth of the creek was also in poor condition, with high levels of ammonia, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, total phosphorus, and zinc. There were also elevated levels of fecal coliform. The Nottingham Intake and Filtration Plant was barred from dumping waste into the creek in February 1988, although it continued to do so at least until 1990. As late as 1989, the creek downstream of Euclid Avenue still ran black with chemical and oil pollution. A major nonsource pollution event in 1989 killed six salmon and 40 to 50 suckerfish in the creek, and Ohio EPA officials feared there were no more fish living in the creek. A NEORSD sewage treatment plant was still venting daily into Euclid Creek in 1991 near the intersection of St. Clair Avenue and E. 185th Street. The city of Willoughby Hills inaugurated a four-year sewage improvement project (the Euclid Creek Tributary Interceptor) in May 2000 designed to end sewage overflows into the east branch of Euclid Creek; According to samples taken in 2000, levels of fecal coliform had dropped in the main and east branch below federal water quality standards, although several tributaries still did not meet the standard. Low levels of dissolved oxygen, detected in the late 1990s and early 2000s, also appear to have been corrected. Although levels of phosphorus have been significantly reduced since 1977, 30 percent of Euclid Creek areas sampled in 2003 were above the target level of . As of 2005, Euclid Creek still suffered from a number of pollution and pollution-related impairments. These included: Excessive organic matter in the water, high levels of nutrients, and elevated levels of disease-causing bacteria. The major sources of pollution were combined sewer overflows during periods of high precipitation, nonpoint sources, septic tank overflows, and polluted stormwater. The creek continues to be impaired by disease-causing bacteria. The creek failed fecal coliform standards 42 percent of the time in 2007. Fecal coliform levels at the mouth of the creek were, at times, in the thousands of parts per 100 milliliters in 2008. In comparison, most Cleveland area swimming areas had fecal coliform levels in the teens per 100 milliliters (or even lower). Euclid Creek failed fecal coliform standards 59 percent of the time in 2008, making it one of the ten most polluted swimming spots in the nation, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The Natural Resources Defense Council declared Euclid Creek the most polluted stream in the Greater Cleveland region in 2011. It continued to receive more than 80 sewage overflows each summer, compared to a national average of two or three. This fell to 60 times a year in 2013. =Pollution control= Pollution control in Euclid Creek is the responsibility of several agencies and governments. The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District provides sewerage in the Euclid Creek watershed, with the exception of Willoughby Hills and some unsewered areas. The Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District is the lead conservation agency overseeing the stream and its watershed. Various departments and agencies of Cuyahoga County oversee water quality, watershed health, and economic and residential development. The Ohio Coastal Management Program, a division of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), is charged by the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 with protecting and sustaining the nearshore portion of Lake Erie into which Euclid Creek empties. The Division of Surface Water of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has designated the main branch downstream of Anderson Road a Warmwater Habitat, while the remainder of the stream and its tributaries are a Limited Resource Water. The section of Euclid Creek between Anderson Road and Euclid Avenue (that contained in the Euclid Creek Reservation) has been designated a State Resource Water, which subjects it to anti-degradation rules established by the Ohio EPA. Ohio EPA has also classified the majority of Euclid Creek as a Primary Contact Recreation Water, indicating it should be safe for human beings to fully immerse themselves in without protection. Fishery Nonbiting midges are one of the most common invertebrate species remaining on Euclid Creek in the 21st century. From prehistoric times into the late 1800s, Lake Erie and its tributaries maintained a healthy fishery. Euclid Creek was no exception: In the late 1800s, catfish, crappies, largemouth bass, suckers, sunfish, and shorthead redhorse were all caught on a regular basis in Euclid Creek. Even the occasional lake sturgeon was found in the creek. In 1918, anglers were regularly catching catfish, shorthead redhorse, suckers, and yellow perch in Euclid Creek. Carp were, by then, also extremely common, and the occasional bass could still be found. Pollution and other impairments led to significant losses in the number and diversity of species by the 1960s. A 1964 study found that invertebrate species were limited to black flies, crayfish, crane flies, flatworms, leeches, mayflies, snipe flies, and seven species of midge. The only game fish which remained in the creek were the hogsucker, green sunfish, and white sucker. Coho salmon and rainbow trout (also known as steelhead) were observed entering the creek, but no spawning occurred. Pollution-tolerant minnow species were the only small fish to remain. These included the central stoneroller, common creek chub, common shiner, emerald shiner, and western blacknose dace. The east branch had a greater diversity of fish than the main branch, but was much less diverse than the nearby Big Creek or Chagrin River. A 1978 survey found 11 species of frog and toad, 13 species of reptile, and 12 species of salamander in or near Euclid Creek. The most common reptile was the box turtle. The common creek chub is one of the few pollution-tolerant fish species to be found in Euclid Creek. Pollution impairment of Euclid Creek worsened by 1984. Water quality was poor in all portions of the stream. Orthocladiinae (a subspecies of midge) and Oligochaeta (sludgeworms) constituted 65 percent of all fauna collected in or near the stream. The other invertebrates found in any number included caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies. At a sampling site near the intersection of Green and Anderson Roads, only small numbers of fish were present, and many of these were infected with fungus or were dead. The east branch of Euclid Creek exhibited the most species diversity of any segment of the stream. Its lower , however, were grossly enriched due to flows from a sewage treatment plant. Species diversity was about as good in the stream segment encompassed by the Euclid Creek Reservation, although the number of animals was much lower. This portion of Euclid Creek appeared to be significantly impacted by nonpoint sources. All fauna in the creek was found to be moderately to highly stressed by pollution. By the late 20th century, only sucker fish survived in Euclid Creek upstream of its lacustuary, and they vanished by 2000. Fish populations in Euclid Creek remain impaired, exhibiting low diversity and a high percentage of pollution- tolerant species. Top-of-the-food-chain predatory fish are absent from the creek, a common indicator of an unhealthy stream habitat. Above the St. Clair Spillway, fish populations are primarily pollution-tolerant minnows such as the central stoneroller, common creek chub, and western blacknose dace. Darters are absent, and this limits the capacity of the stream. Below the spillway, coho salmon, rainbow trout, and smallmouth bass may be found. Improving the nearshore and lacustuary areas of Euclid Creek are important to increasing the diversity, health, and viability of fish populations in Euclid Creek. No fish consumption advisories have been issued by the Ohio Department of Health for fish caught in Euclid Creek. Non-fish macroinvertebrate populations are less impaired than fish in Euclid Creek. The diversity, health, and number of macroinvertebrates in the lower watershed meet ODNR water quality standards, although this is not true for the upper watershed (upstream of Euclid Creek Reservation). The macroinvertebrate population is dominated by pollution-tolerant species like midges and worms, with only low levels of caddisfly, mayfly, and stonefly present. Flora and wildlife Phragmites australis, a grass that is one of the most common invasive species along Euclid Creek Although no wildlife survey of Euclid Creek had been conducted as of 2006, anecdotal evidence indicates that wildlife supported by the stream is typical of that found in an urban area with extensive greenspace: beaver, great blue heron, mink, red fox, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and a small (and perhaps transient) population of coyotes in the Acacia Reservation. Although no known endangered or threatened amphibian, fish, invertebrate, or mammal is known to exist in the Euclid Creek watershed, the lack of extensive studies means that their presence cannot be ruled out. Only a small number of areas, limited in size, have been studied to identify plant species within the Euclid Creek watershed. One endangered plant and two uncommon plants are known to exist in the area. Solidago puberula (\\"downy goldenrod\\") is a perennial herb listed as endangered in Ohio by ODNR. The only known stable population of this plant species in Ohio is found in Highland Heights Community Park near the headwaters of a tributary of the east branch of Euclid Creek. Hypericum gentianoides (a species of St. John's wort commonly known as \\"orangegrass\\" or \\"pineweed\\") and Rhynchospora capitellata (a species of sedge commonly known as \\"brownish beaksedge\\" or \\"brownish beaked-rush\\") are also found in wet areas of Highland Heights Community Park. This is the only known location in Cuyahoga County for either species. As a highly disturbed stream, Euclid Creek is heavily impacted by a large number of invasive plant species. Phragmites australis (a perennial grass) is extremely common north of Euclid Creek Reservation and in nearly all places where the stream banks have been disturbed. Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Reynoutria japonica (Japanese knotweed) are found extensively north of Euclid Creek Reservation. Other common invasive species throughout the watershed include autumn olive, buckthorn, several species of bush honeysuckle, Canada thistle, Japanese honeysuckle, multiflora rose, narrow-leaf cattail, purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, Russian olive, and tree of heaven. History of Euclid Creek =Native Americans and Euclid Creek= Human beings first settled in northeast Ohio about 11,000 BCE, at the end of the Wisconsin Glaciation. This highly nomadic hunting culture, known as Paleo-Indian, disappeared about 8,000 BCE, replaced by the nomadic hunter-gatherer Archaic culture. About 2,500 BCE, this culture was in turn replaced by the semi-sedentary Woodland culture. A warming trend in the global climate about 800 CE created more agriculturally favorable weather in Ohio, which led to the development of subsistence farming. A new society emerged, the Whittlesey culture (named for 19th century Ohio scientist Charles Whittlesey). Between 1600 and 1650 CE, the Whittlesey people disappeared. The cause—absorption into another culture, disease, emigration, low birth rate, warfare, or some combination of factors—is not known. By the time the Iroquois of what is now central New York began moving along the shore of Lake Erie into northeast Ohio in 1650 during the Beaver Wars, the area was almost uninhabited. In the early and mid 1700s, the Mingo, Odawa (or Ottawa), and Ouendat (or Wyandot) occupied northern Ohio after fleeing the Iroquois. By 1800, Native American emigration out of the area was occurring again, and few indigenous people lived anywhere in Ohio by 1850. The Whittlesey people and their predecessors left behind well-defined trails that ran along ridges paralleling Lake Erie. These ridges are the remains of ancient beaches, deposited by prehistoric versions of Lake Erie during times when the lake water levels were much higher. Several of these ridge trails crossed Euclid Creek, and served as the primary route by which white explorers and settlers began moving west into northern Ohio. These Native American trails are now Lakeshore Blvd., Euclid Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue. Native Americans found it difficult to access the Appalachian Plateau from the Erie Plain due to the steepness of the Portage Escarpment. Only a few natural access points existed; Euclid Creek was one of these. Modern Nottingham Road/Dille Road was originally a Native American trail which ran along the southern rim of the Euclid Creek gorge to the plateau, while modern Neff Road/Chardon Road ran along the northern rim. =Euclid Creek during initial white settlement= 1858 map of Euclid Township. White settlement of the Euclid Creek area began when some log cabins were erected on the shore of Lake Erie east of the stream probably in the summer of 1795. Who built them, and why, is not known, and they were abandoned by the spring of 1796. The area around Euclid Creek was surveyed and Euclid Township established in 1796. The surveyors, trained in mathematics, named the township after the Greek mathematician Euclid. Returning east in October 1796, the survey team led by Moses Cleaveland gave the name Euclid Creek to the large creek they encountered between Doan Brook and the Chagrin River. A Connecticut Land Company survey team returned to the area in 1797 and blazed two major routes through the area, North Highway (now St. Clair Avenue) and Central Highway (now Euclid Avenue). North Highway was renamed St. Clair Road in 1815 for Arthur St. Clair, first governor (1787-1802) of the Northwest Territory. The first permanent white settler, Joseph Burke of New York, arrived in the spring or summer of 1798. The second was David Dille, a New Jerseyan who formerly lived in western Pennsylvania. He arrived in November 1798 and settled on the Buffalo Road southwest of Euclid Creek. The third permanent settler, William Coleman of Washington County, Pennsylvania, arrived in either 1803 or 1804 and settled at the mouth of Euclid Creek. Abraham Bishop arrived in the area in 1809, clearing of forest west of what is now the intersection of White and Richmond Roads. Garrett Thorp also settled at the mouth of Euclid Creek in 1810, followed by Benjamin Thorp in 1811. The Central Highway, or Buffalo Road (also known as the Cleveland-Buffalo Road), became the major route through the area. It led from the Cuyahoga River at what is now Cleveland to the area around Buffalo, New York, and was cleared of trees by white explorers and settlers no later than 1810. The trail was cleared of stumps and brush and turned into a dirt road by 1815, and a stagecoach began running once a day between Cleveland and Buffalo. The road was renamed Euclid Avenue in 1825 because it connected Cleveland and the emerging settlement of Euclid (now known as the East Cleveland, Ohio, neighborhood of Collamer). Passengers on the Buffalo Road often had to have assistance in crossing Euclid Creek and its gorge. Wagons could not cross the gorge loaded; they had to be unloaded and cargo carried across the creek and gorge hand. Some wagons had to be partially dismantled to safely cross. The Hermle family established a smithy and wheelwright shop next to the creek to provide these services, and other businesses provided beverages, food, and assistance in moving freight. An inn, Euclid House, was built at the crossing by Abraham Farr in 1815. In 1810, Abraham Bishop built a sawmill on his land on the east branch of Euclid Creek. The War of 1812 marks the end of the initial period of white settlement in Ohio. During the war, American soldiers on horseback were stationed at the mouth of Euclid Creek to provide warning to other settlements in the area in case British ships should stop or pass by. On June 19, 1813, a British naval force under Acting Commander Robert Heriot Barclay anchored off Euclid Creek to wait out a storm. Sailors came ashore and killed a farmer's ox for food, apologizing for the theft. =Euclid Creek from 1812 to 1850= A small hamlet named Euclid Creek (hereinafter the Village of Euclid Creek) formed after the War of 1812 at the intersection of what is now Euclid Avenue and Highland Road, adjacent to Euclid Creek. Memories of the recent war led the citizens of the Village of Euclid Creek to erect a blockhouse as part of their settlement. About 1816, Abraham Farr opened a tavern in a log cabin in the hamlet. A Methodist church was erected in the village in 1821, and a Baptist church from 1821 to 1822. By 1840, the Village of Euclid Creek had three stores, and the Dille family added a dry goods store and post office in 1849. A number of other important businesses opened elsewhere on Euclid Creek in the early 1800s. About 1815, Paul Condit opened a tavern in a frame house near the confluence of Claribel Creek and the east branch. In 1817 or 1818, William Coleman built a gristmill near the mouth of Euclid Creek, and later a sawmill. Coleman's neighbor, William Gray, erected a stoneware manufactory at the mouth of Euclid Creek about 1820. It swiftly grew to seven or eight kilns. Gray sold the works to J. & L. Marsilliott in 1823, who kept it open another 15 years. Toward the end of the 1810s, the Welch family moved from Connecticut and purchased the Euclid Creek gorge north of Monticello Blvd. This area became known as Welch's Woods, and remains as part of the Euclid Creek Reservation today (as \\"Welsh Woods\\"). The national American economy underwent a boom in 1836 and 1837. A large number of people settled in Euclid Township, establishing hundreds of new farms and businesses. A city was surveyed at mouth of Euclid Creek in 1837, but no action was ever taken to build it. In 1840, James Hendershot and Harvey Hussong each opened a stone quarry on Euclid Creek in what is now the Euclid Creek Reservation. Madison Sherman, who opened his quarry on the stream near them at the same time, also built a mill for cutting stone into slabs. About 1840 (or just before), Ruel House, Charles Moses, and Captain William Trist opened a shipyard on the east side of the mouth of Euclid Creek where they constructed canal boats. The shipyard moved to the west side of the stream's mouth in 1845, and shifted production to the construction of schooners. The shipyard closed in 1850. =Euclid Creek from 1851 to 1881= 1854 engraving depicting the Cleveland, Painesville & Ashtabula Railroad bridge over Euclid Creek. One of the most important infrastructure changes to affect Euclid Creek came in early 1851 when the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&A;) constructed a bridge over the creek at St. Clair Avenue. Construction on the CP&A; began in January 1851, and by the end of the month grading had reached Willoughby. The masonry arch bridge had a single span and extensive abutments. At in width, the bridge was wide enough to also permit wagon traffic in addition to trains. The railroad also built a water and fuel stop, known as Euclid Depot, next to Euclid Creek at St. Clair Avenue. The railroad induced east-west road traffic to shift from Euclid Avenue to St. Clair Avenue, and the population center shifted with it. The area around Euclid Depot grew so swiftly that in 1860, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland established a parish on the east bank of Euclid Creek halfway between the Village of Euclid Creek and Euclid Depot. This was the first diocesan parish outside the city of Cleveland. By 1865, Euclid Depot had grown into a large village. The railroad named the village Nottingham, after CP&A; general superintendent Henry Nottingham. Although the Village of Euclid Creek continued to grow until the late 1870s, the village of Nottingham grew much more swiftly. Euclid Cemetery opened in 1864 just above the Euclid Creek floodplain south of the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Highland Road. The cemetery was created as a means of consolidating more than 80 small burial grounds, and by the time it closed had more than 4,000 graves. In 1863 or 1864, attorney George Gilbert opened Camp Gilbert on the site of the former shipyard on the west bank of the mouth of Euclid Creek. Camp Gilbert was the Cleveland area's first resort. Catering to wealthy Clevelanders, the camp featured a three-story Second Empire brick headquarters, a clubhouse, creekside fishing pavilion, and campgrounds. Gilbert sold the camp in 1874 to the Ursulines of the Roman Union, a religious institute of women (nuns) engaged in education. The Ursulines established Villa Angela, a boarding school for girls, at the former Camp Gilbert in 1878. A boarding school for boys, St. Joseph Seminary, opened at the site in 1886. Viticulture and winemaking on a small scale appeared in the Euclid Creek floodplain below the Appalachian Plateau after the Civil War, with vineyards appearing first in the alluvial floodplain in the Euclid Creek gorge in what is now the Euclid Creek Reservation. One of the first large grape-growing operations was founded in 1864 by German immigrant Louis F. Harms on in the area now bounded by Euclid Avenue, Chardon Road, and Daisy Drive. John J. and Mary Schuster founded the area's second large vineyard in 1870, southwest of the Harms vineyard across Chardon Road. Additional quarries opened in the Euclid Creek gorge after the American Civil War. Duncan McFarland opened a quarry in 1867 near where Monticello Blvd. crosses Euclid Creek today. This was the first large-scale commercial stone quarry to open on Cleveland's east side. His sons, James and Thomas, purchased land opposite his quarry on the west side of Euclid Creek in 1871. John Holland and William H. Stewart founded the Forest City Stone Company in 1871 and established a third quarry in the Euclid Creek gorge. Both McFarland quarries were acquired by Forest City Stone in 1875, after which the company opened a fourth quarry on the east side of the creek. These quarries remained in operation until 1915. =Euclid Creek from 1881 to 1916= Chestnut Hills, the mansion built above Euclid Creek by Henry Pickands in 1903 In October 1882, the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad opened. This railroad, which largely ran parallel to and south of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (the former Cleveland, Painesville & Ashtabula), passed through the Village of Euclid Creek, making it an important stopping point again. The railway, whose nickname was the \\"Nickel Plate\\", built a Howe truss bridge over Euclid Creek. In 1895, the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County began converting Euclid Avenue from a plank road into a modern paved street. The road was widened to and paved from downtown Cleveland to Village of Euclid Creek. The project reached Collamer in 1902, and work on the final segment to the Village of Euclid Creek began in the summer of that year. The work was finished in 1902, when a new masonry arch bridge was constructed to carry Euclid Avenue over Euclid Creek. Swedish immigrants constructed a Lutheran church on the banks of Euclid Creek south of Anderson Road at Green Road in 1898. Henry Pickands, a partner in Pickands Mather and wealthy heir of Samuel Mather, purchased in 1902 of land atop Chardon Hill (an area now bounded by Chardon Road, the Euclid Creek Reservation, and E. 221st Street). In 1903, work was finished on a \\"Flemish baronial\\" brick mansion which he named Chestnut Hills. His widow had Chestnut Hills demolished in 1938, and a Neo-Georgian style home erected on the site. The Lakeshore Blvd. bridge over Euclid Creek in 1909 In 1907, a $10,000 ($ in dollars) masonry bridge was constructed to carry Lakeshore Blvd. over Euclid Creek. This was followed in 1908 by a $15,000 ($ in dollars) concrete bridge to carry St. Clair Avenue over Euclid Creek. This bridge was a large one, long and wide, with a high arch.; The first major development south of the Euclid Creek gorge occurred in 1909. That year, a significant number of members of the Euclid Club in Cleveland Heights quit and founded the Mayfield Country Club in Lyndhurst. In July, they purchased an initial of land about northwest of the intersection of Cedar and Richmond Roads. Within a year, the club owned , and had dammed Euclid Creek (which ran north through the club grounds) to provide water for the club's planned 18-hole golf course. The club, reduced to , opened in July 1911.; A Neoclassical house of worship was erected by Nottingham Congregational Church on the west bank of Euclid Creek near Waterloo and Nottingham Roads in 1910. The first of three bridges carrying Highland Road over Euclid Creek was constructed at the north end of the Euclid Creek gorge in 1912. Cuyahoga County wanted to push Highland Road southwest through the Euclid Creek Reservation, but the onset of World War I delayed the start of construction until 1920. A bridge over the east branch of Euclid Creek was built about 1922. Most of the remaining construction occurred in 1924,; although it was not until 1928 that the final portion of Highland Road (connecting it to Euclid Avenue) was paved. Three Highland Road bridges remained to be constructed. Automobiles used fords to cross the creek at these points. The Village of Euclid constructed Central High School at 20701 Euclid Avenue on the east bank of Euclid Creek in 1913. It was downgraded to a junior high school in 1949, demolished in 1967, and rebuilt as Central Middle School. Although settlement and development had largely been contained to Euclid Creek below the Appalachian Plain, a few important changes were beginning to happen to the creek's headwaters. In 1913, Cleveland attorney Charles K. Arter constructed Arter House on the east bank of the main branch of Euclid Creek on what is now Curbside Road in Lyndhurst. The 22-room, Late Georgian mansion sat on an elaborately landscaped estate. The Arter children, Calvin and Charles Jr., donated the estate to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1957, who converted it into the Julie Billiart School (a school for children with learning disabilities). Chester C. Bolton and his wife, Frances, established the Franchester Place estate in 1916 on of land on the northwest corner of Cedar and Richmond Roads. In 1922, the Hawken Boys' School constructed a new school on the east bank of the main branch of Euclid Creek adjacent to the Julie Billiart School. These were donated by the Boltons, and a portion of them turned into athletic fields. =Euclid Creek from 1917 to 1928= The Cleveland Metropolitan Park District (now Cleveland Metroparks) was created by state legislation in 1917. The following year, the park board proposed purchasing the main branch of Euclid Creek and its associated valley from Lake Erie south to Shaker Heights. Although this plan ultimately proved unfeasible, the first of land (consisting of most of the old Harms vineyard) was purchased in October 1920. By the summer of 1926, the park board had obtained title to more than a mile of Euclid Creek south of Euclid Avenue, and in the fall of that year finally secured at the northern mouth of the gorge.; A final were obtained at the south end of the gorge in May 1930, giving the Cleveland Metroparks control over what is now the Euclid Creek Reservation. Cleveland Metroparks made almost no improvements to the Euclid Creek gorge while it was assembling the land for the Euclid Creek Reservation. On November 21, 1933, the federal government approved the establishment of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in the Euclid Creek Reservation. A barracks was erected at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Highland Road, and over the next three years the CCC workers cleared land, planted trees, and built picnic areas, trails, and parking lots. Most importantly, they constructed three bridges for Highland Road (eliminating the last fords on that street) and built what is now Metro Park Drive (also known as Euclid Park Road and Metropolitan Park Blvd.) Workers also armored and channelized the creek downstream of Villaview Road by lining the banks with stone blocks. Euclid Creek Reservation was formally dedicated and opened on June 24, 1936—the first public opening of any unit in the Cleveland Metroparks system. The CCC camp became veterans' housing in 1942, and was demolished in 1944. Other open spaces on Euclid Creek were being developed, however. The Harms family sold the remaining of their vineyard to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd in June 1920. The nuns erected Our Lady of Lourdes Shrine at the site, which was dedicated on May 30, 1926.; In 1921, Dudley S. Blossom, Director of Public Health and Welfare for Cuyahoga County, and his wife, Elizabeth (Frances Payne Bolton's sister), purchased a estate just south of the Bolton's Franchester Place. Over the next year, the couple built a Tudor Revival home on the estate. Between 1922 and 1927, the Blossoms added a service compound that consisted of two small homes for estate workers, a garage, and a stable for horses. Elizabeth Blossom was an avid cultivator of flowers, and established a wild garden in the small ravine through which Euclid Creek flowed on the Blossom estate. After Dudley Blossom's death in 1938, Elizabeth had the main house torn down and a Neo- Georgian style home erected in its place. Another development which impacted the headwaters of Euclid Creek opened in 1923. This was the Acacia Country Club, located on the northeast corner of Cedar and Richmond Roads. Founded in 1921, a temporary clubhouse and the first nine holes of the club opened in May 1923.; ; Press reports say that the owners laid of tile drain to channel water into Euclid Creek. The final nine holes opened in July 1924, and the permanent clubhouse in May 1925. =Euclid Creek from 1928 to 1945= Rapid development atop the Appalachian Plateau began to affect both the main and east branches of Euclid Creek after 1920. In 1928, the Curtiss-Wright corporation purchased of land east of Richmond Road from the Richmond Estates Land Company. The company opened a dirt-runway airport there, and named it Herrick Field after Myron T. Herrick. A hangar was erected in 1929, but area residents won a federal injunction declaring the airfield a noise nuisance and public danger.; It closed on August 1, 1930. Cuyahoga County purchased the sod airfield in 1946 for $200,000 ($ in dollars) and it reopened on May 30, 1950. The airport expanded to by 1963, by 1970, by 1981, and by 1999—encompassing several tributaries of the east branch. The 1902 masonry bridge over Euclid Creek was rebuilt in 1932. A portion of Claribel Creek, a tributary of Euclid Creek, was channelized in 1933 when Ohio Villa, a country club opened northeast of the corner of Richmond and Highland Roads. The club's owner, the Italian-American Brotherhood Club, was forced to close the facility in 1942 after its major investors were found to be bank robbers with connections to the Cleveland crime family. It reopened as the Richmond Country Club in 1942, and Mayfair Dam erected the same year to create Mayfair Lake. After the clubhouse burned in 1953, the site was taken over by the Mayfair Tennis and Swim Club (a Jewish health club). In 1942, the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Mark purchased the Pickands estate. The 1938 Pickands mansion was converted into the Mount St. Joseph Nursing Home. =Euclid Creek from 1945 to 1970= The city of Cleveland began construction on the Nottingham Intake and Filtration Plant on Euclid Creek in July 1947. The project, designed to provide the city's fast-growing east side with fresh water from Lake Erie rather than from Euclid Creek, other streams, and groundwater wells, was first proposed in 1925 and set for completion in 1930. In 1930, the city condemned of land on the east bank of Euclid Creek between the Nickel Plate tracks and St. Clair Avenue. Construction was delayed by the onset of the Great Depression, and the plant finally opened in the early fall of 1951.; While the water filtration plant was under construction, the Cuyahoga County Airport opened in May 1950. In 1954, Cuyahoga County and the city of South Euclid approved the construction of a bridge over Euclid Creek to link Monticello Blvd. and Wilson Mills Road. Officials had spent several years debating whether to build a low-level bridge or a high-level span. The high- level span was finally approved, and the $1.2 million ($ in dollars) structure spanning the wide ravine opened in December 1955. Construction of Interstate 271 began in November 1960. The first segment, from Willoughby Hills to Wilson Mills Road, was under construction by April 1961, with construction on the segment from Wilson Mills Road to Fairmount Blvd. set to begin in the fall of 1961 and the segment from Fairmount Blvd. to Harvard Road for late 1961. The entire route (now extending as far south as Chagrin Blvd.) opened in November 1962. The freeway crossed two tributaries of the east branch (one of them twice), and these waters were rechanneled into a man-made ditch by the freeway's construction. The completion of Interstate 271 spurred a development boom on the east side of Cuyahoga County, greatly affecting Euclid Creek's headwaters. Construction of Interstate 90 and the Lakeland Freeway through the city of Euclid began in the spring of 1961. Euclid Creek was straightened, cutting off a strong meander bounded by Neff Road, Villaview Road, Nottingham Road, and the old Lake Shore railroad tracks. The meander was filled in and a cloverleaf interchange built on the site. Beneath the freeway, Euclid Creek was culverted and a long concrete channel constructed to replace the natural streambed. Work on the Lakeland Freeway in Euclid was finished in November 1962. Construction of the culvert proved to be a turning point in how communities treated water in Cuyahoga County. Previously, streambeds were bridged. Afterward, streams were routinely buried in tunnels or culverted. The headwaters of Redstone Run, one of the east branch's major tributaries, were affected by construction in 1962. That year, the Glazer-Marotta Companies won zoning approval to construct a shopping mall (now Richmond Town Square) on the northeast corner of the intersection of Richmond Road and Monticello Blvd. The company agreed to spend as much as 2 percent of the mall's cost in culvertizing, pumping, and rerouting the headwaters of Redstone Run. Initially, the $8 million ($ in dollars) project was intended to cover just of land in the watershed, but the project was expanded until it cost $42 million ($ in dollars) and covered . The Richmond Mall opened in September 1966.; A year after the mall project was announced, construction began on St. Gregory of Narek Armenian Church across the street at 678 Richmond Road. It opened in April 1964, further impeding the headwaters of Redstone Run. In 1966, a new development in Beachwood impacted the headwaters of the main branch of Euclid Creek. That year, the Jewish Orthodox Home for the Aged moved from Lakeview Road in Cleveland's Glenville neighborhood to a large new site at 27100 Cedar Road in Beachwood. The organization, now called Menorah Park Jewish Home for the Aged, constructed a one-story nursing home.; Over the next half century, Menorah Park constructed an extensive senior living campus. The R.H. Myers Apartments, finished in 1978, contained 207 units in a four-story tower, 10-story tower, and one-story communal area. Stone Gardens, an assisted living facility, opened in 1994, and Wiggins Place, a second assisted living community, in 2004. =Euclid Creek from 1970 to 1995= Villa Angela completed a Modernist school building for its girls' academy on its property at the mouth of Euclid Creek in April 1972. It opened to students in September 1972. The 1864 school building was razed in late 1972.; In 1976, the Rouse Co. announced it would construct a $25 million ($ in dollars) shopping mall, Beachwood Place, on of land owned by the Ratner family on the southeast corner of Richmond and Cedar Roads. The mall (whose cost rose to $30 million ($ in dollars) within four months) began construction atop a portion of the headwaters of the main branch of Euclid Creek in August 1977. Much of the channel was altered and realigned prior to construction. Beachwood Place opened in late August 1978. In 1981, after more than a decade of flooding and discussion about how to correct it, the United States Army Corps of Engineers acted to reduce erosion and flooding on Euclid Creek between Villaview Road and Lakeshore Blvd. The narrow-arched, culverted Lakeshore Blvd. bridge over Euclid Creek was replaced with a wide span at a cost of $1 million ($ in dollars). The city of Cleveland spent another $650,000 ($ in dollars) to purchase of bank along the stream between Euclid Avenue and the lakeshore. The 1930s-era stone block reinforcing the bank was removed, the of creek between Lakeshore Blvd. and the lake was straightened, the creek north of Euclid Avenue widened and deepened, and an additional of the banks and streambed covered in concrete at a cost of $2.12 million ($ in dollars). The Corps also constructed a levee along the east bank of Euclid Creek between Lakeshore Blvd. and E. 179th Street at a cost of about $2.23 million ($ in dollars). Minor changes to the Euclid Creek lacustuary came in 1985, when The Trust for Public Land purchased a small parcel from Villa Angela to expand Euclid Beach. Two years later, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland announced tentative plans to merge Villa Angela with St. Joseph Academy, the former St. Joseph's Seminary which had become all-male high school and relocated to the northeast at 18491 Lakeshore Blvd. As Cuyahoga County embarked on a $4.5 million ($ in dollars), state-funded Euclid Creek flood control project in the fall of 1987, the city and state began planning to purchase the Villa Angela lands and convert them to a public park. Major changes to the Euclid Creek lacustuary when Villa Angela closed in August 1989, setting in motion a major change in the way the lacustuary of Euclid Creek was managed. In July 1989, The Trust for Public Land (with financial assistance from four other foundations) purchased of land from Villa Angela and Associated Estates (a real estate development company) for $2.45 million ($ in dollars). This land was then purchased by ODNR for use as parkland. The state also spent $607,000 ($ in dollars) on gabions to stabilize Euclid Creek's banks between Anderson and Mayfield Roads, and another $250,000 ($ in dollars) to straighten and add retaining walls to Euclid Creek's Redstone Run tributary between Schaefer Park and Roland Park in Lyndhurst. The Cleveland Public Library (CPL) system purchased of land from Villa Angela in September 1990 for $160,000 ($ in dollars) for the construction of a new branch library to replace its Nottingham and Memorial branches (which it intended to merge).; In May 1991, CPL purchased an additional of Villa Angela land (which included the 1973 school building) for $2.2 million ($ in dollars). The library system agreed to keep a part of its acreage parkland, and allowed ODNR to construct a road through this area to provide improved access to the new park at the creek's mouth. CPL spent the next three years and $6.1 million ($ in dollars) remodeling the school into a branch library and administrative structure that provided storage for seldom-used books, the community service department, the technical services department, and training and conference facilities.; The new Nottingham-Memorial Branch Library (the largest branch in the CPL system) opened on August 8, 1994. In 1991, Montefiore Home, a nursing home serving the Jewish community, opened a 240-room facility adjacent to the south side of Menorah Park in Beachwood, further impacting the headwaters of the main branch of Euclid Creek. The facility underwent a major expansion in 2005. Montefiore added the eight-unit Willensky Residence assisted living facility for individuals with Alzheimer's disease in 2012, and expanded it to 25 units in 2015. Another expansion of the Montefiore campus, the six-unit Maltz Hospice House, opened in April 2015.; ; The 1932 bridge over Euclid Creek was rehabilitated in 1991 at a cost of $1 million ($ in dollars). The bridge carrying Anderson Road over Euclid Creek underwent significant repair of its deck in 1991 as well. ODNR constructed a two-lane road and two parking lots in the new park at the mouth of Euclid Creek in 1993 and 1994 at a cost of $6.5 million ($ in dollars).; Euclid Creek was bridged with a new vehicular- pedestrian bridge near the creek mouth to provide access to the parking lots. Another $2.3 million ($ in dollars) was spent in 1994 adding improvements such as a new beach, a long biking/hiking path, new boat docks, a second two-lane boat launch ramp, breakwater, and a fishing pier, and the park was administratively merged with the Cleveland Lakefront State Park. The fishing pier, which was on the west side of the mouth of Euclid Creek, was completed in the spring of 1995. The creek mouth was dredged when the pier was completed. =Euclid Creek from 1995 to 1999= Widening of Interstate 271 to eight from four lanes, which was completed in 1993, led to major new flooding problems on Euclid Creek. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) had moved forward with the project without constructing any new flood control measures after concluding that the interstate highway's existing flood control measures, designed in the 1950s and 1960s, were adequate for an eight-lane freeway. In October 1994, the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District (CS&WCD;) concluded that the widening project had contributed to extensive flooding in Willoughby Hills. According to CS&WCD; studies, ODOT engineers did not account for the increased runoff into Euclid Creek caused by extensive new impervious development, channel straightening, and channelization in Beachwood, Lyndhurst, and Highland Heights since the design of Interstate 271. An investigation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1997 found that Beachwood had for years permitted construction within the Euclid Creek flood plain that did not follow federal regulations. Nor had the city alerted FEMA to the alterations made to the stream's channel (as required by law) during the construction of Beachwood Place in 1977 and 1978. In November 1997, a hydrological study (paid for by the city of South Euclid) blamed the widening of I-271 and overdevelopment in Beachwood for significantly worse erosion problems in the Euclid Creek Reservation and flooding in communities downstream from Beachwood. Stormwater velocity had increased from 60 percent to 90 percent since 1959, and the volume of stormwater runoff from 40 percent to 80 percent, even as storm and regular rainfall remained constant. A second study, issued in June 1999, concluded that the city of Beachwood had not followed standard stormwater management practices since 1980, and the two stormwater detention basins it had constructed were of only minimal effectiveness. In response to the Euclid Creek flooding and other extensive combined sewer problems in the greater Cleveland area, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District initiated in 2001 a $1 billion ($ in dollars) project to construct of underground detention basins, tunnels, and sewers on Cleveland's East Side. The first phase of the project was the construction of the Euclid Creek Storage Tunnel, a diameter, long underground stormwater storage basin that stretched from the Euclid Creek Reservation northwest to the city of Bratenahl. The Euclid Creek Storage Tunnel was completed in September 2015, and became operational in June 2016 when the Easterly Tunnel Dewatering Pump Station went online. The pumping station was designed to empty the Euclid Creek Storage Tunnel as well as the as-yet incomplete Dugway Storage Tunnel and Doan Valley Storage Tunnel and divert their stored stormwater to the Easterly Wastewater Treatment Plant. 2001 also saw Cleveland and nine east-side suburbs form the Euclid Creek Watershed Council to work together on Euclid Creek and combined sewer flooding. Water quality and velocity in Euclid Creek was of a major concern to the group, which tentatively set plans to restore meanders to the stream as an initial goal. =Euclid Creek in the 21st century= In 2002, a new nonprofit advocacy group, the Euclid Creek Watershed Council, formed to address flooding and water quality issues along Euclid Creek. The group began working closely with the Euclid Creek Watershed Coordinator, one of 319 watershed coordinators funded by ODNR. Housed within the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District, the Watershed Coordinator acts both as the secretary of the Euclid Creek Watershed Council and its staff person. The headwaters of the main branch of Euclid Creek were significantly impacted by the construction of the Legacy Village lifestyle center in Lyndhurst in 2003. TRW Inc. had purchased the Bolton estate in 1985 and the Blossom estate in 1992. Although the Bolton mansion was retained, the company demolished the Blossom house (but not the service compound structures) in 1993. Within a few years, TRW resolved to close its operations in Lyndhurst and sell its property to developers. Lyndhurst voters narrowly approved rezoning the area to retail from residential in November 2000. TRW donated most of the old Bolton estate to the Cleveland Clinic in 2002, selling the remaining to First Interstate Properties, a real estate development firm. Legacy Village opened on October 24, 2003. Only 60 percent () of the land obtained from TRW was developed. Some of the remaining land was used as a buffer between the mall and local residences, while of woodlands and wetlands were retained and restored (including the old Bolton wild garden). Land west of Legacy Village, located between the shopping center and a luxury development known as \\"The Woods\\", contained a small main branch tributary. The Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District was granted a conservation easement over this land to preserve it. First Interstate restored the Blossom service compound, which was then listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2004. Dam removal on Euclid Creek became a priority for the stream's restoration advocates in the mid-2000s. The Ohio EPA released in 2005 a study (required by the federal Clean Water Act) which concluded that alteration or removal of the St. Clair Spillway would greatly improve invertebrate and fish populations in the creek. Cost of removing the spillway proved prohibitive, however: A 2010 study estimated this cost at $2 million ($ in dollars). The Euclid Creek Reservation Dam was removed at a cost of $527,000 ($ in dollars) in 2010 after a five-year effort. Part of the cost went to restoring the stream after the dam's removal. Despite improvements, by 2010 flash flood-like runoff remained an issue for Euclid Creek. The Plain Dealer newspaper called the Euclid Creek Reservation \\"the region's catch-basin for storm water runoff\\". Flash-like flooding was so severe that the park had been extensively damaged and erosion control within the park was failing. Cleveland Metroparks purchased the Acacia Country Club in 2012 and began restoring Euclid Creek within the new park boundaries. Acacia's owners agreed to sell the land to The Conservation Fund for $14.75 million ($ in dollars), despite opposition from Lyndhurst Mayor Joseph Cicero and a group of real estate developers (who offered $16 million for the land). An anonymous donor financed The Conservation Fund's acquisition, with the stipulation that the land no longer be used as a golf course but rather be converted into a nature park. A month later, The Conservation Fund donated the land to Cleveland Metroparks. The nonprofit also made a $300,000 ($ in dollars) donation to the park agency to help with the transition, and pledged another $200,000 ($ in dollars) once restoration plans had been finalized. One of the first projects Cleveland Metroparks undertook at Acacia was the restoration of Euclid Creek. This involved removing the culverts through which the creek flowed, rebuilding a meandering channel, removing armor and channelization structures, and reconnecting the stream to its floodplain. Projects the following year included removing the tile drainage system which underlay the park, building swales throughout the park, and planting extensive new trees, shrubs, native plants, and grasses around Euclid Creek and elsewhere in the new park. The work was paid for with $1.5 million in grants from the Ohio EPA and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District called it the \\"single largest restoration effort in the history of the watershed\\". A pedestrian-only bridge was constructed over the mouth of Euclid Creek by Cleveland Metroparks in 2016. The 1992 fishing pier at Lower Euclid Creek Reservation was demolished in the fall of 2016, and a new pier constructed in 2017. NEORSD began a Euclid Creek Shoaling Removal Project in November 2017. The two-month-long project removed gravel, sand, wood, and trash which degraded habitat and inhibited water flows in Euclid Creek's manmade channel between Lakeshore Boulevard and Villaview Road.

These hollows, each having a diameter of 10–20 metres and an average depth of 2.4 metres, occur in groups, sometimes numbering fewer than ten and at times more than a hundred. Archaeologists believe that construction of these features may have begun in the Iron Age. Etymology Some accounts credit Mary Leakey with having introduced the term \\"Sirkiwa holes' following excavations at Hyrax Hill between 1937 and 1938.Places to Visit: Hyrax Hill Pre-Historic Site and Museumhttp://www.theserenaexperience.com/?p=923 online An account in the introduction to Hollis' book on the Nandi, published in 1909, indicates that the term Sirikwa was already in use: An origin narrative from the Sengwer gives an earlier origin of the name: It is thus likely that Sirikwa was the name of one of the two major groupings within the Sengwer of the Sirikwa era, and correctly passed on to Thompson from his Okiek guide as the descriptor of the name of the people who built those cattle pens that he saw in the Uasin Gishu. By 1909, the name had generally passed on to the wider culture associated with this type of structure and Mary Leakey picked it to describe the finds she found at Hyrax Hill. It has been argued by some that use of the word holes to describe the feature is misleading. Purpose Excavations at several examples of these sites in the western highlands and in the Nakuru area show that they were deliberately constructed to house livestock. Features =Fencing= Excavations indicate that these hollows were surrounded by a fence or stockade and on the downhill side, a single gate, usually with extra works and flanking guard houses. In rocky terrain, notably the Uasin Gishu Plateau and the Elgeyo border, stone walling substituted for fencing or provided a base for the same. At the time of the first recorded accounts during the late 18th centuries, some of the dry stone walling could still be seen though they were mostly in deteriorated state.Pavitt, N. Kenya: The First Explorers, Aurum Press, 1989, p. 121 =Housing= From the remains it is apparent that houses were not built inside the actual Sirikwa holes, they were attached however and were constructed on the outer side of the fence, being approached through the stock-pen and entered through a connecting door. =Rubbish mounds= Mounds are found in association with \\"Sirikwa holes\\" and are usually situated below the entrance and were formed by the dumping of mud, dung and general refuse from domestic use such as food bones and the occasional broken pot.

A. Chandrasekhar decided to produce a film under the direction of his former assistant Senapathi Magan. The film was inspired by incidents that took place in the producer S. A. Chandrasekhar's own life. Newcomers Kathir and Arundhati were selected to play the lead roles along with Archana Sharma and Pavina who were also first- timers. A three-month rehearsal was also held for them before shooting began. While shooting in the villages near Dindigul and other places, the unit needed several temples for the shoot. In the area of Ambasamudram, instead of using a set, S. A. Chandrasekhar decided to make a real Vinayagar temple ten feet away from the Thamirabarani River and then leave it for the villagers to use. Nearly 3 lakhs of rupees were spent on the temple which had a temple ritual and a feast for the entire village of nearly 2000 people during the 20-day shoot. While shooting in Aiyapetti, a giant 30 feet Aiyanar was built with cement and mortar and after the shoot, it was left installed in the village for the locals to worship. They also built the compound wall of an Amman temple near Sedipetti. Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Bharani. The soundtrack, released in 2010, features 8 tracks. The audio was released in many cities across Tamil Nadu. At Sathyam Cinemas, in Chennai, S. A. Chandrasekhar's son Vijay launched the audio on 5 May 2010 and actress Kushboo received the first copy of the CD. R. Parthiepan, R. B. Choudary, Rama Narayanan, Kalaipuli G. Sekaran and S. Thanu attended the audio function. Release The film opened across nearly 105 screens in Tamil Nadu, which was considered \\"huge for a film with newcomers\\". Initially the film had its release date fixed on 25 June 2010, but it was released the following week on 2 July 2010. The magazine Ananda Vikatan gave the film a rating of 38 out of 100. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, \\"Performance wise, new hero Kadhir has quite a long way to traverse while debutant Arundhati, who looks charming and just right for the role, tends to overact\\". Behindwoods.com gave the film 0.5 star out of 5 and stated, \\"With a storyline like that, the movie could have fit anywhere between the 70s and the late 80s\\". A critic from Indiaglitz.com wrote, \\"Music is by Bharani with a couple of hummable tunes, while cinematography is bright and good. Produced by S A Chandrasekaran, the movie by Senapathy Magan could have been much better had he concentrated on the script and trimmed it an interesting way\\". Sify rated the film \\"Below Average\\" and said, \\"The only silver lining in otherwise a drab film is the performance of the lead cast especially the new girl Arundhathi. There is nothing much to write about as far as the technical side, music or packaging is concerned\\". A reviewer from Dinamalar praised the lead pair and the rest of the cast's acting, and he criticized for its similarity to the film Pasanga (2009).

Origins  According to David Lasocki, Anthony de Countie may have been a Spanish musician of Jewish origin, but he is more likely to have been an Italian because he had an Italian wife, Lucretia, and he lived with another Italian, Francis Jetto, between 1565 and 1571.  Career  Anthony de Countie was employed as a lutenist at the English court from 1550 to 1579. He occupied the post of \\"royal lewter\\" during the successive reigns of three sovereigns of the House of Tudor, namely Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I, though there is a period (1557–1564) during which his movements are not accounted for. The Elizabethan court could boast of numerous musicians during the 1560s and 1570s, but only de Countie is specifically identified as a lutenist. He is also, perhaps mistakenly, listed among the players of the virginals.

The day after his invasion of Zululand, the British General Lord Chelmsford led a reconnaissance in force to the kraal of Zulu Chief Sihayo. This force had orders to burn the kraal to the ground as punishment for two of Sihayo's sons having entered the British Colony of Natal to kill two of Sihayo's wives who had fled there. The British force drove off a numerically inferior Zulu force but found the kraal unoccupied, Sihayo having answered a call to arms from the Zulu king Cetshwayo. The kraal was burnt and the British returned to their camp. The attack is believed to have led Cetshwayo to attack Chelmsford's force over the other two British columns operating in Zululand. The British were subsequently defeated by the Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana.  Background  The British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Henry Bartle Frere had been attempting to form a confederation of British possessions in Southern Africa. As part of this ambition the annexation of neighbouring Zululand was planned, this led to the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. The pretext for the war was an ultimatum issued by Frere to the Zulu king Cetshwayo. The ultimatum required the surrender of the brother and two son's of Chief Sihayo, who had entered Natal to abduct and murder two of the chief's wives who had escaped. Other clauses including the payment of cattle as fines, the turning over of chief Mbilini for raiding cattle in British territory and the admittance of missionaries to Zululand. The document also required wholesale changes to the Zulu system of government including limits on the use of the death penalty, the requirement for trials, supervision by a British official and the abolition of the Zulu army and associated restrictions on marriage. The ultimatum was harsh, demanding radical change in the Zulu way of life, intended by Frere that Cetshwayo would reject it. On 11 January 1879 the ultimatum expired and the British forces, under Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand in three columns. The main force, the centre column under Chelmsford, crossed the Buffalo River into Zulu territory at Rorke's Drift and made camp.  Advance  Movements during the Action at Sihayo's Kraal. Initial engagement (white circle) Chelmsford determined to attack Sihayo's kraal (a type of homestead with a cattle enclosure) which lay some from his camp. He did this to secure his left flank for the advance upon the Zulu capital of Ulundi and as a punitive measure against Sihayo for his son's transgressions. Chelmsford ordered a force, commanded by Colonel Glyn of the 24th Regiment of Foot, to leave the camp at 3:30 a.m. on 12 January; this was later described as a reconnaissance in force. Glyn's command was a mixed force of men from his regiment, men of the Natal Native Contingent (commanded by Major Wilsone Black) and some irregular mounted infantry (commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Russell). Chelmsford chose to accompany the force, usurping command of it from Glyn. The British troops proceeded north-east from the camp keeping to a track on the right hand bank of the Bashee River. After around a quantity of cattle were observed on the far side with a number of Zulus to the hills above them. Chelmsford ordered the troops across the river to prepare for an attack. Whilst Glyn and Chelmsford consulted on their battle plan, the Zulu taunted the British saying \\"Why are you waiting there? Are you looking to build kraals? Why don't you come on up?\\".  Action  An engagement between British mounted irregulars and the Zulu The Zulu defended a horseshoe-shaped gorge and Chelmsford ordered Russell's mounted men to move to the south where the hillsides could be climbed and to sweep around behind the Zulu on the heights to threaten them and cut off any retreat. In the meantime three companies of the 1st battalion of the 24th Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Natal Native Contingent (under Commandant Hamilton- Browne) were to assault the Zulu on the lower ground and attempt to seize the cattle. The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Natal Native Contingent (commanded by Commandant Cooper) were held in reserve. The NNC led the advance and did so enthusiastically until they came within gunshot of the Zulus who were hiding among boulders, shrubs and caves at the sides of the gorge. At this point they were challenged by a Zulu shouting \\"By whose orders do you come to the land of the Zulus?\\". A newspaper reporter, Charles Norris-Newman, with the British recorded that no reply was made but Hamilton-Browne claimed that his interpreter, Lieutenant Duncombe, replied \\"By the orders of the Great White Queen\\". The Zulu then opened fire on the British right flank, their first shot striking a man of the Natal Native Contingent (NNC) and breaking his thigh bone. The NNC became pinned down and were reluctant to assault the Zulus, who fired from the rough ground. Attempts by their non-commissioned officers to force them forwards by clubbing them with rifles failed and Black ordered men of the 24th Regiment forwards in support. This succeeded and the NNC followed Black, who led the charge with his sword in one hand and his hat waved above his head in the other. Black's hat was soon shot from his hand but he escaped unscathed despite being almost struck by a boulder thrown at him by a Zulu from above. The 2nd Battalion of the NNC was also brought up in support but the action was over by 9:00 a.m., lasting around half an hour. At least a dozen Zulu were killed along with two NNC men, around twenty NNC men and two of their officers were wounded. Russell's mounted contingent found around sixty Zulu in the heights; they dismounted and exchanged fire. By 10:00 a.m. the fighting had ended; outnumbered, the Zulu were driven off for the loss of ten killed. One of Sihayo's sons, Mkumbikazulu, a suspect for the incursion into Natal was among the dead.  Burning of the kraal  After the action a force of four companies of the 2/24th and part of the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd NNC commanded by Colonel Degacher of the 24th Regiment was sent to Sihayo's kraal with orders to burn it to the ground. The kraal was located some further along the Bashee valley and above it. Degacher found the kraal, its neighbouring homesteads and mealie fields deserted aside from three old women and a young girl. The settlement was burnt to the ground and the force marched back to its camp by the Buffalo River, reaching it by 4:00 p.m.  Aftermath  The British defeat at Isandlwana The British officers were reasonably pleased with the day and considered that the NNC had performed well in their first action. The total Zulu casualties were estimated at thirty killed and four wounded. At least one of the wounded was taken prisoner and treated at the British hospital at Rorke's Drift, he was killed in the Battle of Rorke's Drift on 22/23 January. The British captured 13 horses, 413 cattle, 332 goats and 235 sheep with some of these being driven into Natal. The British troops were pleased with this as they anticipated payment of prize money for the livestock. Chelmsford wrote to Frere, Sihayo and his senior son, Mehlokazulu, escaped the action, having left the day before with his fighting men to answer Cetshwayo's call to arms at Ulundi. News of the attack reached the Zulu king whilst he was considering which of the three British columns to attack. The news seems to have convinced him to attack the centre column; part of Chelmsford's force was subsequently annihilated by the main Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January. The locations of the actions have been disputed as records kept by the British were vague and no battlefield relics have been recovered. The historian Keith Smith places Sihayo's kraal at Sokhexe, a settlement still occupied by Sihayo's descendants and the earlier action at a location somewhat to the south near Ngedla hill.

In September 1502, explorer Christopher Columbus arrived to eastern Nicaragua on his fourth voyage to the Americas.

Gil González Dávila named the territory after a chief named Nicarao and combined the name for the Spanish word for water (Agua).BBC: Nicaragua profile - Timeline In 1524, Spanish conquistador Francisco Hernández de Córdoba founded the first Spanish settlements of Granada and León.Britannica: History of Nicaragua As a result of the Spanish invasion, the native population drastically fell. Within three decades an estimated native population of one million plummeted to a few tens of thousands, as approximately half of the natives died of contagious diseases originally from Europe, and most of the rest were made to work in forced labor in other New World Spanish colonies. The territory of Nicaragua soon officially became part of the Spanish Empire under the Viceroy of New Spain based in Mexico City and administered by the Captaincy General of Guatemala based in Santiago de Guatemala. For most of Spanish colonization, the territory was mostly neglected. In 1740, Great Britain took over the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and held it until 1786. =Independence= In 1808, Joseph Bonaparte was installed as King of Spain and several Spanish American colonies began to declare their independence from Spain. As Nicaragua and most Central American nations were governed by Mexico City; New Spain declared its independence from Spain in 1810. In 1821, the Plan of Iguala declared Mexico as a constitutional monarchy. Nicaragua declared its own independence from Spain in 15 September 1821 and chose to join the Mexican Empire under Emperor Agustín de Iturbide. In March 1823, Iturbide resigned as Emperor and Mexico became a republic. Nicaragua decided to separate from Mexico on 1 July 1823. Nicaragua, along with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras formed the Federal Republic of Central America.

(881 x 12 m), Surface: Asphalt Interstate 20, a major east-west highway, is directly north and oriented roughly perpendicular to the runway, with a 20 ft (6.1 m) tall uphill highway embankment at the approach end of runway 17 (downhill at the departure end of runway 35); the airport is officially closed to transient student traffic. Despite this rule, a student pilot was killed in 2001 when he overran runway 35 on landing and struck a semi-trailer truck traveling eastbound, resulting in the highway being closed for several hours. Additionally, two occupants of a Piper PA-22 Colt were seriously injured when the aircraft struck the embankment on approach to runway 17 in 1993. For the 12-month period ending April 28, 2016, the airport had 25,240 aircraft operations, an average of 69 per day: 99% general aviation and less than 1% military. At that time there were 63 aircraft based at this airport: 94% single-engine and 6% multi-engine, with no jets, helicopters, ultralights, or gliders.

The aircraft's nose struck an embankment only short of the runway, causing substantial aircraft damage; both aircraft occupants suffered serious injuries. The accident was attributed to \\"[The] total loss of engine power with cause undetermined. A factor was the lack of suitable terrain.\\" *August 21, 1999: A Piper PA-28-180 Cherokee, registration number N8981J, lost engine power immediately on takeoff from runway 17. The aircraft struck trees and a retaining wall during the subsequent off-airport forced landing, suffering substantial damage; one aircraft occupant suffered serious injuries and the other occupant suffered minor injuries. The accident was attributed to \\"The loss of engine power during the initial takeoff climb for an undetermined reason. A factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.\\" *July 16, 2001: In a rare case of airplane theft, two men stole a Piper PA-28-180 Cherokee from Parker County Airport, but crashed while attempting to land at Bridgeport Municipal Airport a short time later, suffering serious injuries. Hudson Oaks police speculated that the men intended to refuel the aircraft in Bridgeport before flying it to Oklahoma. Neither of the thieves had ever held a pilot certificate, but the man who acted as pilot reportedly had 6 hours of prior flight time. * August 22, 2001: A Cessna 152, registration number N4755B, overran runway 35 after a downwind landing, coasting into the main lanes of adjacent Interstate 20 and striking a semi- trailer truck traveling eastbound at . The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot, who was the sole occupant, was killed. The student pilot, returning to Fort Worth Meacham International Airport after a solo instructional flight, reported to air traffic control that he was lost and low on fuel; he then initiated a landing at Parker County Airport to refuel. After bouncing several times during a landing attempt on runway 17, the pilot took off, turned 180°, and landed downwind on the same runway (numbered 35 in the opposite direction). Witnesses report that no apparent attempts were made to apply brakes or takeoff power before the craft coasted off the north end of the runway and down an embankment. The accident was attributed to \\"The student pilot's improper decision making in that he landed with a tailwind and failed to execute a go-around, which resulted in a runway overrun. Contributing factors were the inaccurate reading of the left fuel gage as a result of improper maintenance by the operator/maintenance personnel, and the tailwind condition.\\" The truck driver was not injured, but the interstate was closed to traffic for several hours. * January 15, 2004: A Beech B36TC Bonanza, registration number N7252X, crashed in an open field in Willow Park, Texas while on approach to land at Parker County Airport in instrument meteorological conditions. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot, who was the sole occupant, was killed. The accident was attributed to \\"The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while maneuvering.

Personal life Hilmi Esat Bayındırlı was born to Turkish parents on June 5, 1962, and grew up in Verbier, Switzerland. At the age of 17, he moved to the United States. He attended the La Jolla High School in California to take some classes voluntarily. After developing an interest in jewelry making, he went to Oregon to get trained at a school in diamond setting. In the next two years, he ran a jewelry business in San Diego, California. As a passionate skier, he realized that he had too little time for his sport hobby. Therefore, he gave up retailing jewelry and instead handcrafted rings and designed pendants in his home workshop for sale privately. Later, he moved to Utah. He is father of a son, Esat H. Hilmi Ba/ındırlı. The family lives in Park City, Utah, United States. He is also known as Erik Bayindirli, and nicknamed \\"Ebay\\". Road accident In August 1981 at the age of 19, he was involved in a road accident, which was caused by a flat tire when driving at high speed and subsequently loss of control of the vehicle. His car tipped over onto its roof after rolling over several times. He was ejected and remained under the crashed car. He broke his back, and became paralyzed due to the spinal cord injury. While he has full function of his arms and fingers, he has only partial control of his body and no leg function. This leaves him unable to walk. Sports career Inspired by his father, Bayındırlı began skiing together with his brother Jem (Jem Bayindirli) in Switzerland when he was three years old. He was always performing skiing before he was paralyzed. Around six months after his injury, he became aware of adaptive skiing, and upon his physician's advise, he continued in skiing as a disabled pursuing his passion. His disability pointed him towards competitive sport. He improved himself in the para-alpine skiing sport discipline, and began to develop the outrigger ski suitable for his needs. He is convinced that the right equipment is crucial in para-skiing. For his problem solving talent in handcrafting his skiing equipment, he is dubbed Mac Gyver, the title character of a TV series. The monoski, he built with an additional shock absorber for his legs, helped him to improve his racing performance in the Super-G discipline at World Cup. He competes in the disability class of LW11, which is a sit skiing sport class for para-skiers with paralysis in the lower extremities. His first participation in a skiing competition was at Winter Park Resort, Colorado in 1981. In addition to Giant slalom, he competed in the sitting versions of some other disciplines, such as Downhill, Slalom, Super-G and Super Combined. A graduate of Alpine skiing branch at the Rowmark Ski Academy in Salt Lake City, Utah, he is tall and weighs . The para-skier trains at the National Ability Center in Park City, ref name=\\"p\\"/> He performs also water skiing, para-cycling with a handcycle and wheelchair tennis as hobby, which keep him in shape. He played at U.S. Wheelchair Tennis Open in San Diego. =Unites States= During a stay in Copper Mountain, Colorado, he decided to participate at the U.S. Disabled Alpine Championships. He won one gold and two silver medals in the competition. He internationally debuted at the Para Alpine Skiing World Cup held at Kimberley, British Columbia, Canada in 1989. In 2006, he was admitted to the U.S. Paralympics Alpine Skiing Team, and debuted at the Winter Paralympics in 2006 in Turin, Italy, where he took place 33 in the Giant slalom, sitting event. In 2007, he placed third in the U.S. Nationals that earned him a spot in the 2008 U.S. team. At the 2008 Hartford U.S. Disabled Championships in Soldier Mountain Ski Are, Fairfield, Idaho, he won a third place in Downhill, sitting event, a third place in NORAM sitting and another third place in the slalom, sitting, a fourth place in the Giant slalom, sitting and a third place in the Super-G, sitting event. The same year, he ranked sixth in the slalom event at \\"The Hartford Ski Spectacular\\" held in Breckenridge, Colorado. At the 2010 IPC Alpine Skiing NORAM Cup held in Park City, Utah, he captured the first place. He became runners-up at the same tournament in 2013. He placed sixth at the finals of 2013–14 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup. =Turkey= As he was not selected by the U.S. Paralympic Committee to race at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Canada, he decided to join the Turkish team, which had not participated at the Winter Paralympic Games before. Turkey saw \\"his decision as a great honor\\". Bayındırlı was qualified to take part at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, representing Turkey by gaining a direct quota. He was part of Turkey's first ever participation at the Winter Paralympics along with his teammate Mehmet Çekiç. He finished the giant slalom, sitting event at place 18.

It is an endoparasite of frogs and toads and has an unusual life cycle which synchronises with that of its host. Description P. integerrimum is a leaf-like flatworm that can grow to a maximum length of about . At the anterior (head) end are the mouth and a pair of suckers, and at the posterior end is the main device by which the parasite attaches to its host, the opisthaptor, with its three pairs of suckers, a pair of hooked anchors and marginal hooks. The flatworm's mouth is connected to a muscular pharynx, an oesophagus and a gut, but it has no anus. Ecology P. integerrimum inhabits the bladder of a frog or toad where it feeds on blood, mucus and the sloughed cells of its host. Unlike many species of flatworm, the adults are either male or female, with functional testes or ovaries. The eggs are produced throughout the year but are stored in the host's bladder and only pass out into the water when the amphibian returns there to breed; in this way, the flatworms synchronise their reproductive cycle with that of their amphibian hosts. After hatching, the flatworm larvae, called oncomiracidia, make their way to the gills of developing tadpoles, where they attach. Here they stay until the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis, at which time they crawl over their hosts' bodies and enter their bladders through their cloacas. Some of the flatworm larvae develop in a different way, particularly when developing on younger tadpoles, becoming prematurely sexually mature while still attached to the gills of the tadpole. These neotenic individuals are capable of producing viable eggs which pass out into the water and develop in the normal way.

She was one of the best juvenile fillies in the British Isles in 1907 when she won three of her six races including a victory over strong male opposition in the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year she won the 1000 Guineas but was brought down when favourite for the Epsom Oaks. She won two more races in Ireland before her racing career was ended by injury. She was retired from racing to become a broodmare, but none of her produce survived long after birth. Background Rhodora was a brown mare bred and owned by the American political boss Richard Croker. During her racing career she was trained in Ireland by James Allen. Also involved in the conditioning of the filly was a Dr McCabe, whose methods, which involved an emphasis on sunlight and fresh air, ran contrary to prevailing opinions. She was sired by St. Frusquin who won the Middle Park Plate, Dewhurst Plate, 2000 Guineas, Princess of Wales's Stakes and Eclipse Stakes and was described as one of the best horses of the 19th century. His other progeny included Flair, St. Amant, Rosedrop, Quintessence, and Mirska. Rhodora’s dam the American-bred Rhoda B., also produced the Epsom Derby winner Orby. Racing career =1907: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1907 Rhodora ran six times. She recorded three wins and two second places. In July she was sent to England for the National Breeders' Produce Stakes at Sandown Park and finished second, beaten a neck by the leading colt White Eagle. She subsequently sustained an injury in a race at Leopardstown when she was kicked by a colt named Temeraire. In autumn the filly was sent to Newmarket where her day-to-day conditioning was handled by Fred McCabe. In October she was ridden by Billy Bullock in the Dewhurst Plate and won at odds of 100/7 from a field which included the King's colt Perrier (who finished second), Norman, Your Majesty and the Duke of Westminster's highly regarded Vamose. She was entered for the Middle Park Plate, but had to withdraw from the race in October due to a respiratory disease epidemic at Croker's farm in Newmarket. =1908: three-year-old season= On 8 May at Newmarket, Rhodora was one of nineteen fillies to contest the 95th running of the 1000 Guineas in which she was ridden by the American jockey Lucien Lyne and started at odds of 100/8. She looked less than fully fit before the race and Croker reportedly had little confidence in her chances. The Middle Park Plate winner Lesbia started favourite while the best fancied of the other runners were Bracelet (Cheveley Park Stakes) and Elm Twig. Rhodora appeared to have the race won a long way from home and came home two lengths clear of Bracelet, with Ardentrive a neck away in third. Her winning time was a second faster than the one recorded by Norman in the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance. On 5 June Rhodora started 6/4 favourite ahead of the Derby winner Signorinetta in the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles but failed to finish the race, being brought down when French Partridge slipped and fell in front of her. She was back in action late that month and finished unplaced behind White Eagle in the Biennial Stakes at Royal Ascot. She ran poorly again when unplaced behind Your Majesty in the St George Stakes at Liverpool in July. In September Rhodora returned to Ireland where she won both the Turf Club Cup and the Champion Prize at the Curragh. In the latter race she came home ten lengths clear of the Irish Derby winner Wild Bouquet. The filly was being prepared for a run in the Cambridgeshire Handicap when she suffered a training injury which ended her season. Rhodora's earnings for the year amounted to £7,380. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rhodora an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Rhodora was retired from racing to become a broodmare at Croker's Glencairn stud. After failing to conceive in her first two seasons she was bred to her half-brother Orby, an experiment in close inbreeding which \\"caused astonishment in breeding circles\\". She had an obstructed labour resulting in the death of the foal. Barren for many years, despite repeated breeding to the stallion White Magic, Rhodora was euthanised in early 1922 by her new owner Donald Fraser. Her body was rendered to make dog food for his kennels. The act was viewed as \\"a sombre and heartless end\\" for the mare by the press.

Her inter-related crimes included fraud, abortion, conspiracy to commit the murder of a witness, and the actual murder of her formal fiancé. Biography Marie Margarethe (nickname, Grete) Beier was born September 15, 1885, in Brand-Erbisdorf. She was the daughter of Brander Mayor Ernst Theodor Beier and his wife Ida Karoline, née Clausnitzer. In 1905, she met the clerk Johannes Heinrich Merker and secretly became engaged to him without the knowledge of her parents. After she broke off the relationship with him because of his infidelity, she met, in 1906, the chief engineer Heinrich Moritz Curt Pressler. They became engaged at the request of his parents. Beier's relationship with Pressler was always cool, and because of his domineering nature, there soon arose a dispute between the two. She then secretly reconnected with Merker, who had become an embezzler. From this relationship, in the summer of 1906, she became pregnant and had an abortion in November 1906. Pressler planned a wedding for 14 May 1907. Beier tried to prevent it. Merker tried, too, creating fake love letters to a non-existent Italian named Ferroni, sending these to Pressler. After the April 1907 death of Kröner, a relative who was the administrator of the poorhouse in Freiberg, Beier falsified his will, stole jewellery and a checkbook from her parents' house, took Kröner's savings, and shared the money with Merker. At the same time, a reader request for the design of a will to appoint the bride as sole heir was answered and reprinted in a Freiberger newspaper. A few days later, Beier set up a fake testament to her groom and poisoned him with cyanide on the eve of the planned wedding in Chemnitz. She then shot him with a revolver in the mouth to simulate his suicide. Immediately after the act, she sent more letters to Ferroni to make the suicide appear believable. In May 1907, the theft from the parent's house was detected. In the course of the investigation, Beier created other falsifications and lies to direct the suspicion to others. After her arrest in June 1907, an illegal abortion trial was also initiated. A little later, Merker was also arrested. In November of that year, Beier confessed to the murder of Pressler. Death 1908 Grete Beier letter Grete Beier's guillotine Grete Beier's headstone in Dresden After a petition for mercy was rejected by the king, Beier was guillotined on July 23, 1908 at the age of 22 years by the state executioner, Moritz Brand, on the scaffold in the courtyard of the district court at the Albert Park in Freiberg. She was buried in the family grave in the Johannisfriedhof in Dresden. An account of the event was published by the Missouri State Medical Association, quoting the Kansas City Star:— “Freiberg, Saxony, July 22, 1908. Grete Beier, the 18-year-old [sic] daughter of the mayor of Freiberg, was beheaded last night in punishment for the murder of the man to whom she was engaged to be married. The executioner of this young woman reached the city last night. He carried a thin, long box containing the ax with which he did his work and also brought with him a hand- bag with a suit of evening clothes. The wearing of this garb is an official requirement of the somber occasion. The preparations for the execution of the death sentence at the prison had been completed and the man did his work quickly and privately and departed from Freiberg as quietly as he came. The executioner is an anonymous person sent here from Dresden on the announcement that the king of Saxony had refused to pardon Grete Beier for her crime.\\" Literature ;Scientific * Gotthold Leistner: Sachsen und die Guillotine.

A rambler gate is a self-closing footpath barrier that is in common use in some parts of Britain. It is designed to allow pedestrians to pass but to provide an effective barrier to livestock. It resembles a squeeze stile but the gap can be expanded by pushing a pair of pivot posts apart. The pivot posts will close under their own weight but are held back by a number of short chains so that they cannot touch. In the closed position, the pivot posts and the chains prevent the passage of animals. There may be a simple latch to hold the two pivot posts together. A rambler gate is relatively easy to use and it is possible, but awkward, to get a bicycle though. Although it may be easier to negotiate than a stile, pushing the pivot posts aside does require some strength and, as they close, they can catch the unwary. The design is compact and easy to install. It is important to keep the mechanism free of debris. The gates keep out livestock, horses, motorcycles and vehicles. They are also a barrier to baby buggies, wheelchairs and mobility vehicles.

History  Mountain Rimu Timber Company Limited was incorporated on the 24 January 1898 to purchase the mills of Messrs Kusabs Brothers. It owned 4000 acres of rimu bush. The mills and the head office were situated about from the railway station, with which it was connected to by the tramway. The machinery was driven by a twenty-five horsepower stationary steam engine. There were a full sawing and planing plant, capable of turning out of sawn and dressed timber daily. A market for the timber was found throughout the Auckland District, and a good deal was exported to Australia. A large quantity of firewood was cut and shipped to Rotorua. Mamaku. In: The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Auckland Provincial District), Cyclopedia Company Limited, Limited, Christchurch, 1902. New Zealand Railways (NZR) concluded around 1924-26 that it would be advantageous to supply its own sawn timber, and thus purchased the mill. On 31 August 1934, the sawmill closed down, and its employees were made redundant. The reason was that the timber could be obtained more cheaply elsewhere. The NZR Railway Board had called tenders for timber, and found that it was able to get it at a materially lower price than was being paid for it from its own mill at Mamaku.Parliamentary Debates, New Zealand Parliament (30 August 1934), Vol. 239, 1935, p. 548-549.Parliamentary Debates, New Zealand Parliament (12 July 1934), 1934, p. 386. At that time there were of timber left. There was a steel tramline constructed right into the bush, and there were facilities, which no other mill possessed. The plant was close to the railway line on the top of the Mamaku divide, with the easiest hauling conditions. There were two log haulers, two miles of wire rope, two locomotives, one of which has only recently been placed there, and twenty-six cottages from which revenue to the extent of £5oo a year in the shape of rentals was drawn.

Course of the battle  During Easter Week, on Tuesday 11 April 1525, Farmer George (Bauernjörg) and his army were still deployed on a line from Ulm to Leipheim. In the evening of that day he encamped in Baltringen, one of the bases of the rebellion. Three days later, the mercenaries (landsknechts), armoured cavalry (panzerreiter), and camp followers (tross) of the Swabian League, financially supported by Jacob Fugger, encamped in the rather flat terrain west of the town towards Bad Waldsee, near the Leprosenberg (\\"Leper's Hill\\"). The peasants under their leader Pfaff-Florian of Aichstetten had oriented their positions south of the town on the hilly terrain of Auf der Bleiche below the Ziegelberg hill. Small skirmishes took place in the run-up to the battle. Both army commanders had considerable local knowledge as the battlefield was only 20 kilometres from each of their home towns. The peasants were unable to penetrate the town walls surrounding Wurzach or to convince the townsfolk to take their side. On Good Friday, 14 April 1525, the positions of the peasant army were fired upon by the cannons of the Swabian League. The two forces each had about the same number of troops. However, the experienced landsknechts and armoured riders of the Swabian League, with their better armament and training, were the decisive factors in the battle. In the evening the overmatched peasants began to withdraw. Those peasants who fled to the west of the positions of the Swabian League were lucky. They were able to escape in the direction of Gaisbeuren. The fleeing peasants who tried to escape in the night in the direction of the Wurzacher Ried and Wurzacher Ach were probably killed, since they were also pursued by Farmer George's cavalry. The Lepers' Chapel, 2012 A series of further battles followed. By September 1525, all fighting and punitive action was over and Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII thanked the Swabian League for their intervention. Pfaff-Florian was one of the survivors of the battle and fled to the Confederation after the Treaty of Weingarten was negotiated. As a rule, commanders and leaders were executed immediately upon capture. Captured rebel peasants had to pay a general bounty of 6 guilders in instalments and were later released. George and his cousin, William, were both appointed by Emperor Charles V on 27 July 1526 in Toledo as Imperial Stewards (Reichserbuchstruchess). The Lepers' Hospital (Leprosenhaus) and Lepers' Chapel (Leprosenkapelle), founded in 1505, may still be seen on the site of the battlefield today.

She was Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of both the US National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Background and education Dorothy Leavitt Cheney was born August 24, 1950 in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father was an economist and U.S. Foreign Service officer. From 1964 to 1968 she attended Abbot Academy. In 1972 she graduated from Wellesley College, where she majored in Political Science and was a Durant Scholar. She married Robert Seyfarth in 1971 and in 1972 they initiated a joint research project on wild baboons in the Mt. Zebra National Park, South Africa. Following this field research, she became a doctoral student under the supervision of Robert Hinde, at Cambridge University. She received her PhD in 1977. Cheney died of breast cancer on November 9, 2018, at her home in Devon, Pennsylvania. Career After Cambridge, Cheney (along with her husband) joined the laboratory of Peter Marler at Rockefeller University, where she held a National Science Foundation post-doctoral fellowship and later became an Assistant Professor. In 1981, Cheney and Seyfarth became Assistant Professors in the Department of Anthropology at UCLA. In 1985 they moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where Cheney was a member of the Anthropology Department from 1985 to 1991 and the Biology Department from 1991 until her retirement in 2016. Cheney was elected Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1983), the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation (1995), the Animal Behavior Society (1997), the American Academy of Arts & Sciences (1999), and was elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2015. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences awarded its 2010 Cozzarelli Prize, for the best article in the area of Behavioral and Social Sciences, to a paper about baboon collaboration coauthored by Cheney and Seyfarth. Cheney received a Biology Department teaching award (2009), the Distinguished Animal Behaviorist Award from the Animal Behavior Society (2016), the Distinguished Primatologist Award from the American Society of Primatologists (2016), an honorary doctorate from the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland (2013), and the Distinguished Alumni Award from Phillips Andover Academy (2017). Research In 1973 and 1974, Cheney and Seyfarth studied the social behavior of baboons in the Mt. Zebra National Park, South Africa. Cheney's research focused on the development of juveniles and subadults of both sexes. In 1977, as post-doctoral fellows working with Peter Marler, they began an 11-year study of behavior, communication, and cognition among vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. They developed field \\"playback\\" experiments to study the information that listeners acquire when they hear a vocalization – particularly vervet monkey alarm calls – and showed how such experiments can be used to test hypotheses about the monkeys' knowledge of each other's social relationships. Their work is described in the book How Monkeys See the World (Cheney & Seyfarth 1990, University of Chicago Press). Between 1985 and 1992, working jointly with their post-doctoral colleague Michael Owren, Cheney and Seyfarth carried out cross-fostering experiments on rhesus and Japanese macaques at the California National Primate Research Center (UC Davis). They tested whether infant and juvenile primates can modify their use of vocalizations depending on the social environment. Results revealed striking differences in the development of call production (largely fixed), usage of calls in the appropriate context (more flexible), and responses to the calls of others (highly modifiable). Starting in 1992, Cheney and Seyfarth carried out a 16-year study of communication and social behavior among baboons in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. There, they and their colleagues continued their experimental studies of social cognition, showing that monkeys have a sophisticated understanding of each other's dominance ranks and social relationships. They also used non-invasive techniques to study the factors that contribute to stress and its alleviation under natural conditions. This work is described in their book Baboon Metaphysics (Cheney & Seyfarth, 2007, University of Chicago Press). Since 2005, research conducted jointly with Joan Silk has shown that, as in humans, individuals who establish close, stable bonds with others experience increased fitness in the form of greater longevity and offspring survival. Individuals with close social bonds also experience reduced stress levels. These results suggest that natural selection has favored individuals who have both the skill and the motivation to form strategic social bonds, and that the evolutionary antecedents of human cooperation can be found even in species without language or culture.

In 2019, he successfully ran for Virginia House of Delegates’ 40th district seat, defeating 18-year Republican incumbent Delegate Tim Hugo. The majority of the district’s population and landmass is located in Fairfax County.  Early and personal life  Helmer was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Yaron Helmer and Dr. Lynn Helmer. His grandparents were Holocaust survivors and came to the United States as refugees. After graduating from his local public school, Helmer attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from West Point in 2003 and later received a Rhodes Scholarship, with which he earned a master's degree from the University of Oxford. Helmer has two sons with his wife, Karen. Karen is a Fairfax County Public School teacher.  Career  = Military service = Helmer began his military service as an armor officer. He served with the 4th Infantry Division in Iraq in 2004. Afterwards, he was deployed again with the 1st Infantry Division to Afghanistan in 2007. In Afghanistan, Helmer was the lead instructor of the Counterinsurgency Academy, which helped soldiers to “understand local politics, culture and history” in order to increase local support for the Kabul government and more efficiently combat the Taliban. After Afghanistan, Helmer spent three years in South Korea. He has continued his military service in the U.S. Army Reserve, where he was selected in 2017 for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel and subsequently promoted. = Professional career = Helmer joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in 2014. He helped lead BCG’s veterans’ outreach initiatives, and he served both public sector and private sector clients. Currently, he is a partner in a Virginia-based small business where he works to protect veterans' healthcare and support non-profit and private sector clients.  2018 congressional election  In 2018, Helmer was a Democratic candidate for Virginia's 10th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. According to The Cook Political Report, former state senator Jennifer Wexton was “the substantial frontrunner” in the race and Helmer faced a significant uphill battle. Wexton won the Democratic primary election on June 12, 2018. During the race, Helmer focused heavily on campaign financing. According to Helmer, his campaign “refused all donations from corporate PACs, the NRA, and Dominion Energy.” In addition to campaign finance, Helmer made gun violence prevention a central issue of his campaign. Drawing on his military experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, Helmer called for closing gun sale loopholes, universal background checks, bans on high-capacity magazines, and Extreme Risk Protective Orders to combat gun violence. While he was running for Congress, Helmer received national attention for his unique, occasionally provocative campaign ads. In 2017, one of Helmer’s campaign videos entitled \\"Helmer Zone\\" went viral, reaching number four on the YouTube trending list within 24 hours. The video, in which Helmer spoofed the film “Top Gun” and sang “You’ve Lost That Centrist Feeling,” garnered mixed reactions. Helmer had been an early and vocal proponent of impeaching President Trump. Another of Helmer’s campaign ads sparked controversy by saying, “After 9/11, the greatest threat to our democracy lived in a cave. Today, he lives in the White House.” The ad led to his sparring with hosts on the conservative talk show Fox & Friends. Delegate for Virginia's 40th district =Election= In 2019, Helmer was the Democratic candidate for Virginia's 40th House of Delegates district. He ran against Republican incumbent Tim Hugo, who had been in office since 2003. The race broke Virginia's fundraising record for a House of Delegates election, with Helmer and Hugo raising a combined $3.6 million. Helmer won with 52% of the vote. Similar to his Congressional bid, Helmer focused much of his campaign on his identity as an Army veteran and his support for the gun regulations proposed by Governor Ralph Northam. Again Helmer refused to take contributions from corporate PACs. In the first quarter of 2019, his campaign manager reported that he had received more than 500 individual contributions and amassed more than $124,000, the largest total raised by a challenger to a Republican House incumbent in Virginia history. Helmer would go on to raise $729,547 from individual donations, more than any candidate in House of Delegates history. = Committees and subcommittees = As a freshman in the Virginia General Assembly, Helmer sat on four committees: Agriculture Chesapeake and Natural Resources Communications, Technology and Innovation, Public Safety, and Transportation. On those four committees, Helmer was a member of five subcommittees: Chesapeake, Firearms, Transportation Systems, Motor Vehicles, and Communications.  Political positions  = Gun control = Helmer has long been an advocate for gun violence prevention. He credits his service in the Army with shaping his views on the regulation of firearms. In May of 2018, Helmer went to a gun show in Chantilly and demonstrated how it was possible to buy an assault rifle, described by Helmer as \\"functionally similar\\" to what he had used in Afghanistan, without a background check in under 10 minutes. The video was picked up by major news organizations such as The Washington Post, The Hill, and Vox. In 2018, Helmer headlined the Giffords Organization Veterans Tour, alongside Captain Mark Kelly to advocate on behalf of military veterans running for Congress who supported gun safety laws. Helmer was chief co-patron of Virginia’s HB 2, providing for Universal Background Checks. He was also a co-patron of HB 674 and HB 1004, both red flag laws, as well as a patron on HB 567, which banned indoor shooting ranges in buildings not owned or leased by the Commonwealth. Helmer was the Chief Co- patron of Virginia’s Assault Weapon Ban, which sparked widespread protests by gun-rights advocates, as well as the formation of “second amendment sanctuaries” by conservative municipalities in Virginia. He has been endorsed by numerous high-profile gun control advocates, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Everytown for Gun Safety, Giffords, and The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. In January 2020, Helmer introduced HB 567, a bill that would outlaw all indoor firing ranges in buildings with more than 50 employees in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bill would have forced the NRA to close their indoor gun range at their headquarters in Fairfax. That same January, when gun rights activists descended on Richmond, Delegate Chris Hurst and Helmer allowed students representing March for Our Lives to sleep in their offices in Richmond in order to be able to participate in gun violence prevention advocacy. = Environment = Helmer has denounced the Trump administration for abandonment of environmental protections as well as denial of science. Helmer was a patron of HB 714, the Virginia Energy Plan, and HB 1526, which regulates electric utilities. In January of 2020, Del. Richard Sullivan Jr. introduced the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) with Helmer as a chief co-patron. The VCEA requires Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power “to produce their electricity from 100 percent renewable sources by 2045 and 2050.” The Washington Post has called the VCEA “the most forward-looking state energy plan in the South.” Helmer’s support of conservation and climate change prevention has earned him endorsements from Clean Virginia, Clean Water Action, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, and the Virginia Sierra Club. = Women’s rights = After Helmer and his wife, Karen Helmer, had their second child, Helmer says she was diagnosed with a condition that makes pregnancy potentially life-threatening. Helmer has stated that his wife's diagnosis strengthened his dedication to expanding Virginians’ access to affordable healthcare and protecting women's reproductive rights. He ran an ad in which his wife criticized his opponent’s opposition to women’s reproductive healthcare rights. Helmer voted for passage of HB 980, which removed restrictions on which types of healthcare professionals could perform an abortion. In April, CNN reported that “the new laws ma[d]e Virginia the first state to codify new abortion protections in 2020.” Helmer was a vocal supporter of and voted for HJ1, passage of which made Virginia the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. He was also a patron of HB 913, a bill related to sexual violence on college campuses. = Healthcare = As a partner of a small business that combats the exploitation of veterans by the pharmaceutical industry, Helmer has emphasized his experience standing up to special interest groups. On his website, he states that he aims to “make healthcare accessible and affordable to all.” Helmer supported the establishment of a new in state Healthcare Exchange in Virginia, was co-patron of a bill that caps insulin co-pays in Virginia at $50 per month, and chief co-patroned a bill, HB 1559, that would have mandated transparency in prescription pricing. Helmer has long supported adding a public option to enable all Americans to have access to Medicare through the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2019, this led to his Republican opponent claiming that Helmer sought to abolish private insurance, which PolitiFact subsequently indicated “misstates Dan Helmer’s position on private health insurance.” = Economic and labor policy = Helmer is a strong supporter of worker’s rights. He served as chief-co patron of HB 438 which mandates that law-enforcement officers and firefighters must be compensated for any post-traumatic stress disorder incurred because of their profession. He also has been a leader in seeking to enact paid family medical leave in Virginia, including serving as chief co-patron of HB 825, which sought to establish a paid family medical leave program in Virginia. Helmer’s support for workers’ rights has led the Virginia AFL-CIO and Virginia Professional Firefighters to endorse his campaign. = Education = Helmer’s wife Karen is a Virginia public school teacher and his two sons go to Fairfax County public schools. According to Helmer, his wife’s difficult work as a teacher motivated him to fight for adequate funding for school systems and increasing teacher salaries to combat overcrowding and educator brain drain. Helmer also seeks to make school a safer place for students. In January of 2020, Helmer introduced HB 913, which grants immunity from punishment for drug and alcohol abuse to students reporting an act of sexual violence. Helmer has also supported efforts to protect schools from mass shootings and gun violence. = Governmental reform = Helmer has been a vocal supporter of anti-gerrymandering legislation. In March of 2020, Helmer, as part of the Virginia Commonwealth Caucus, published an opinion piece in The Washington Post calling for the passage of a constitution amendment that reforms the redistricting process. Ultimately, the Virginia House of Delegates voted through HB 758 to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would let a nonpartisan commission determine districts in what The New York Times described as “a blue-moon political step.” Helmer has also been a critic of corporate campaign finance. In both his Congressional bid and his 2019 campaign for state representative, Helmer chose not to take contributions from corporate PACs. Helmer was a co-patron of Delegate Joshua Cole’s HB 111, which would have prohibited contributions from any public service corporation. = Immigration = As the son, grandson, and great-grandson of immigrants, Helmer has made immigrant rights a legislative priority. Helmer, who served three years in South Korea, served as chief co-patron of HJ134, which designates October 9, 2020 and each succeeding October 9 as Hangul Day in Virginia in recognition of the Korean written language. His immigration policy proposals have won him the endorsement of CASA in Action, the Korean-American Democratic National Organization, and the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium. = Infrastructure = Helmer spoke out against the lack of infrastructure funding to Virginia’s transportation systems. Virginia is home to what The Washington Post described as “the worst traffic \\"hot spot\\" in the country” on Interstate 95. He cites his own family’s experience with Virginia’s transportation challenges as one of his motivations for tackling the issue. = Criminal justice reform = Helmer was a chief co-patron of HB 972, which decriminalized Marijuana in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Biography He was born near Naumburg, a nephew of Karl Christoph Traugott Tauchnitz. His firm, founded in Leipzig in 1837, was noted for its accurate classical and biblical texts, its dictionaries, and other works of reference. In 1841, Tauchnitz began a Collection of British Authors, now extending to some 3500 volumes and widely read on the continent of Europe. English authors were paid a royalty by Tauchnitz, who thus helped to establish the present international copyright law. A similar collection of German Authors (translated into English) was begun in 1866 and Students' Tauchnitz Editions of English and American works began to appear in 1886 with notes and introductions in German. In 1860 the title of baron was conferred upon him by the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and his title was recognized by the king of Saxony in 1861. Tauchnitz was made British Consul General for Saxony in 1872, and a member of the Saxon House of Peers in 1877.

The game was released exclusively on the Nintendo Wii U in North America on December 16, 2015 and on January 7, 2016 in Europe and has been praised for its unique use of the Wii U Gamepad.  Gameplay  Temple of Yog starts with a tutorial level, playing as 'Ao the Original', that explains the basic movement, defense and shooting controls of the game and earns the Compass item. Players can use shadow power to teleport between the game's light and shadow realms, which are displayed on the television and the display on the Wii U Gamepad, respectively. Players use this dual-screen technique to navigate through a labyrinth. Whichever realm the player character is not currently occupying is displayed on the Gamepad, which allows for strategy in navigating the maze and engaging enemies. Many elements of the game are procedurally generated based on player data, such as the layout of the game's levels and item system. After the tutorial, players first choose a tribute from four starting guilds based on distinct archetypes: The Holy Augers (clerics), the Cult of the Magi (mages), the Livid Blades (warriors), and the Rogue's Nest (rogues), each with their own unique base stats consisting of HP (hit points), MP (magic points) and SHW (shadow power). Each guild features a different play style based on range, strength and speed of attack and a special ability. The clerics can heal themselves, the mages can manifest a shield, the warriors have a high- powered fireball attack, and the rogues utilize a high-speed roll maneuver. Upon selection, the tribute is given a name (such as Gougre the Worldly or Clementine the Hidden) and sent to the temple. The game is played via dungeon runs inside a temple which are initiated by walking through a portal at the temple zenith. Before entering the player can choose to equip a previously earned item from one of the pedestals surrounding the portal. Once inside, players earn Boon Points during each temple run by defeating enemies, such as spiders and snakes, and completing quests given by multi-colored obelisks. After the run, the tribute is ranked on a scale that goes from \\"pitiful\\" and \\"weak\\" up to \\"worthy.\\" Boon earned can be spent afterwards on upgrading the stats of each guild.  Plot  In Temple of Yog, the player acts as a deity that plays as sacrificial tributes from four guilds through a procedurally- generated labyrinth filled with dangerous enemies.  Development and release  Temple of Yog was announced on August 28, 2014 and was in development for approximately a year and a half.> In 2015, developer ChudChud Industries took the game on tour, stopping in seven cities for live events featuring a preview of the game and a series of live musical performances by the game's soundtrack composer Dr. Zilog and master of ceremonies Buster Wolf. Artist Lee Bretschneider was also featured on the tour.} The official trailer was uploaded to Bretschneider's YouTube channel on October 5, 2016. Temple of Yog was released in North America on December 16, 2015 and on January 7, 2016 in Europe.  Graphics  Temple of Yog features 16-bit-inspired graphics designed to resemble classic games. The pixel art for the game was made by Lee Bretschneider in Photoshop and was designed specifically to be friendly to color-blind players.  Soundtrack  Temple of Yog features a chiptune soundtrack composed by Dr. Zilog. A sampler of the game's soundtrack has been released for download via Bandcamp.  Reception  Temple of Yog was met with mixed reviews and has a Metacritic score of 54. Some reviewers praised the game, such as Mike Diver of VICE who said, \\"There's rather more to this title than surface impressions suggest. Indeed, it quickly becomes quite compelling,\\" and speculated that it \\"could become quite the cult hit of 2016.\\" Tyler Treese of We Got This Covered also suggested it was worth a look despite its problems, calling it a \\"fun diversion\\" and stating \\"If you're a Wii U owner, you owe it to yourself to check out one of the few games that actually takes advantage of the GamePad.\\". Temple of Yog was also an official selection in the 'Digital' category at the 2015 Indiecade festival, the international indie game festival held annually in Culver City (Los Angeles), California.

At the same time, he studied aesthetics, a degree he did not complete because he decided to go to the United States where he earned a postgraduate degree in education at the University of Miami. Passionate about football, Pohlhammer, who is the nephew of the legendary \\"Sapo\\" Livingstone, played in his youth for his alma mater's sports club; he was under-15, under-16, and under-17 captain on squads with players such as Orlando Ramírez, under the direction of Fernando Riera. During his youth he practiced amateur boxing; he won 37 victories (32 of them by knockout) on the La Reina–Peñalolén circuit. He was champion of that neighborhood in a tournament held at the José Arrieta Guindos Stadium and, later, from the English schools of Santiago. He also participated in rugby and swimming. Pohlhammer published his first book in 1979, but fell in love with writing earlier, as he himself said, at age 19, when he was in his second year of university. His first important recognition came in 1993, when he was granted the Pablo Neruda Award. Later he received other distinctions, including the 2008 Santiago Municipal Literature Award for his poetry collection Vírgenes de Chile. In 2015 he held his first exhibition of digital prints, Pic-poemas. He teaches literature courses at various universities and conducts workshops. He has participated as a panelist and writer on various television programs (Teatro terapia, Lo mejor del Mundial, ¿Cuánto vale el show?, Sin Dios ni late, Síganme los buenos) and has been president of the Union of Chilean Poets and minister of happiness of the cultural-political movement Por un Chile Participativo y Feliz.

In 1983, the strategies for leprosy control were changed and National Leprosy Eradication Program was launched. In the same year, multidrug therapy was also launched. In 1991, the World Health Assembly resolved to eliminate leprosy at a global level by the year 2000. In order to strengthen the process of elimination in the country, the first World Bank supported project was introduced in India in 1993 and completed in 2000. The second World Bank supported project happened between 2001-2002.

Background At the 2015 election, Cheshire West and Chester (CWaC) was the only council to be won by Labour from the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats had lost their last seat on the council, while both UKIP and the Green Party had increased their vote share but failed to win seats. With only a narrow Labour majority, the Conservatives were hopeful of regaining the council. However, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum had significantly reshaped British party politics and BBC journalist Phil McCann noted that CWaC was the most evenly divided borough in the North West in terms of Leave/Remain, making the effect of Brexit on the election difficult to predict. Between the 2015 and 2019 elections, a boundary review was carried out. The number of councillors was reduced from 75 to 70, with some wards merged and others split. In total there were 219 candidates – 70 Conservative, 66 Conservative, 49 Liberal Democrat, 18 Green, 11 independents (including Eveleigh Moore-Dutton, elected in 2015 as a Conservative), 4 UKIP and 1 For Britain Movement. 24 existing councillors stood down. Results The election saw Labour narrowly lose its majority, winning 35 seats of the 70 available – a result local election analyst Andrew Teale attributed chiefly to the boundary changes – but remain the largest party. The Conservatives fell back considerably, with just 28 seats, but still won the largest share of the vote. The Liberal Democrats returned to the council, winning 2 seats in Winsford Swanlow (formerly Labour) and Fardon (formerly Conservative), and the Greens won their first ever seat on CWaC, taking Helsby from the Conservatives. Independents also surged – incumbents Martin Barker in Parkgate and Eveleigh Moore-Dutton in Tarporley held their seats, and two further independents won a seat from the Conservatives in the multi-member wards of Weaver and Cuddington, and Hartford and Greenbank. =Results by ward= Blacon Central and Grange Chester City and The Garden Quarter Christleton and Huntington Davenham, Moulton and Kingsmead Farndon Frodsham Gowy Rural Great Boughton Handbridge Park Hartford and Greenbank Helsby Lache Ledsham and Manor Little Neston Malpas Marbury Neston Netherpool Newton and Hoole Northwich Leftwich Northwich Winnington and Castle Northwich Witton Parkgate Rudheath Sandstone Saughall and Mollington Shakerley Strawberry Sutton Villages Tarporley Tarvin and Kelsall Tattenhall Upton Weaver and Cuddington Westminster Whitby Groves Whitby Park Willaston and Thornton Winsford Dene Winsford Gravel Winsford Over and Verdin Winsford Swanlow Winsford Wharton Wolverham Notes • italics denote a sitting councillor References 2019 Category:2019 English local elections Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom Category:2010s in Cheshire ","title":"2019 Cheshire West and Chester Council election"},{"id":"57378620","text":"Lockalloy is an alloy that consists of 62% beryllium and 38% aluminum.

Architecture  Located at the Pizz area in Brunate with a panoramic view over Como outside of the historical centre, it is composed of five floors, with different proportions related to the nearby villas but in line with the great hotel structures present in Italy and in Europe at the time. The floorplan is rectangular and its façade has six neoclassical lesenes that alternates with large single and double windows surmounted by important stuccos that give movement to the façade together with the balconies, to which its parapets parts are in wrought iron. On the ground floor there is a large veranda overlooked by a large terrace supported by columns.. The hotel had fifty rooms: on the ground floor and the first floor there were the rooms for vestibule, dining room, leisure room and smoking room, while on the upper floors there were the guest rooms and suites.

She was best known for preserving historic riverboats in Cincinnati. Her biggest preservation project was helping to save the Delta Queen.  Biography  Blake was born on September 20, 1930 in Lexington, Kentucky and grew up in Carlisle, Kentucky. Blake was part of the campaign to help elect her father, Stanley Blake, to the Kentucky Senate in 1936. Blake attended the University of Kentucky and earned a degree in business in 1952. Blake's first job was working at WLW-TV in Cincinnati, and while she was there, applied to work as a salesperson for Avalon Steamboat Lines. When she applied for the job, the president said, \\"Look, this little lady wants to sell our boat. Isn't that wonderful?\\" Blake was successful at the job and when the company was sold to the Belle of Louisville, Blake went to the Greene Line Inc, as the public relations director for the Delta Queen in 1962. The Delta Queen was \\"a floating hotel with a troubled occupancy rate\\" when she took over and was threatened by the federal Safety at Sea law which prohibited wooden vessels from carrying more than 50 passengers overnight. Blake promoted the Delta Queen using a steamboat race between the Queen and the Belle of Louisville in 1963. The race eventually became an annual attraction during Kentucky Derby Week. Blake helped the Queen reach around a 90% occupancy rate for is 188 bed-capacity. However, the Safety at Sea law threatened to put the boat in dry dock in 1966. Blake collected signatures for a petition to get a special act passed exempting the boat from the new law. Congress passed the special act, saving the boat. The exemptions were limited, with one passed on 1973, extending into October 31, 1978. Blake also helped lead the campaign to have the boat listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In 1975, Blake was one of two women on the board of trustees of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce. When she was promoted to president of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company in 1976, she became the first woman to serve as the president of a major American cruise line. In 1979, Blake left the Delta Queen to open her own public relations and marketing firm called Betty Blake & Co. A 400-seat passenger boat, the Betty Blake, was named after her by on April 12, 1980. Blake became ill in December 1981. She died from stomach cancer in Georgetown, Kentucky on April 13, 1982. Blake was buried in Carlisle Cemetery where her headstone reads only \\"Hi There.\\" In 1996, Blake was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame.

Native American tribal governments have established TLEs to further expand their business portfolios beyond traditional industries associated with tribal economies, such as gaming, payday lending, natural resources, and government contracting. Native American tribal lending is often operated through an online hub, based on sovereign tribal land, and offering loans to consumers (government-to-consumer lending).  History  Native American tribes have diversified revenue streams in internet-based consumer lending through tribal lending enterprises that are often financed by a third (outside) party. As arms of the tribe, tribal lending entities benefit from the tribes' sovereign immunity in relation to state-based consumer lending regulation; \\"as nations that predate the Constitution and the United States, tribal nations can generally operate in licensed environments independent of state regulation.\\"  Controversies  Some critics of short-term lending have alleged that American Indian tribes do not benefit from their lending businesses, and that the businesses are a loophole allowing \\"payday lending firms affiliating with Native American tribes and taking advantage of tribal sovereignty to offer loans online that would otherwise be blocked by many US state laws.\\" Leaders in American Indian tribal lending have rejected these allegations of their tribes being \\"rented\\" for private parties for profit at the expense of tribal members. Many have stated that this is \\"offensive to all Native Americans\\". Some members of Congress have agreed, and in 2013, a letter signed by 31 congressmen and women opposed a federal crackdown on tribal lenders. Multiple court cases have also reinforced tribes' ability to operate these businesses. Many tribes have made the strategic business decision to outsource which has created a peak for tribe gaming as of 2018. Because of this, online tribal lending has become a key economic tool for American Indian Tribes.  Examples  Examples of Tribal Lending Enterprises include the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians, Plain Green Loans, Chippewa Cree and others.

Jatta was forced to cede a portion of his territory to the British in 1840. He led the Soninke during the early part of the Soninke-Marabout War, and after the Storming of Sabbajee in 1853, ceded more land to the British. Jatta was killed after being shot through the heart during a Marabout attack on his capital at Busumbala in 1855.  King of Kombo  In 1840, Jatta was persuaded by Sir Henry Vere Huntley, the Lieutenant Governor of the Gambia, to cede a northern portion of his territory to the British as a settlement for Liberated Africans. This territory later went by several names, including British Kombo, Kombo St. Mary, and Cape St. Mary. Jatta was the sitting King when the Soninke-Marabout War broke out in 1850. The war saw the ruling Soninke people pitted against radical Islamists known as Marabouts. Jatta led the Soninke faction in the war, which was focused on the towns of Yundum, Busumbala, and Brikama. The Marabouts were focused at Sabbajee, Gunjur, and Brefet. Much of the early war was fought via mercenaries. Jatta signed a treaty with British Governor Luke Smythe O'Connor in 1853, in which agreed to cede a further northern part of his territory, including the town of Sabbajee, on the condition that the British quell the Marabouts in the area. This led to the first Storming of Sabbajee in 1853. Jatta was killed in battle on 24 June 1855, when a Marabout force under Fodi Kabba attacked his capital at Busumbala. His forces were able to repel the attack, but Jatta had been shot through the heart and was killed instantly in the fray.

He is known as a Boom FM radio host. He is a well-known controversial figure in Latvian politics and culture. Since 2014 he has been actively involved in politics. He is currently a member of Latvian Parliament, elected as a member of the Latvian Association of Regions, but in December 2015 became an independent and on May 3, 2016 he started his own political movement Who owns the state?  Early life  Kaimiņš graduated from Riga 64th high-school and the Latvian Academy of Culture. His father is attorney Maris Mūrnieks. His grandmother, Baiba Kaimiņa (born December 7, 1937 in Igate), was a gymnast, as was his mother, Liene Kaimiņa. While Kaimiņš was an actor, he experienced a major car crash, in which two actors died. Three more of them, including Kaimiņš, had serious injuries. He changed his birth name in 2015 from Arturs to Artuss.  Entertainment career  = Film and theater = Artuss Kaimiņš has been involved in a total of 16 films, as either actor or director. Some of the most notable ones that he has acted been in are ‘’Kolka Cool’’, ‘’Monotonija’’, ‘’Daudz laimes!’’. He has also acted in the Valmiera Drama Theater and in the Latvian National Theater. While Artuss Kaimiņš was a National Theatre actor, he went to the United States of America to pursue his career there. However, he subsequently changed his mind about acting in the US. \\"I did not get far in America. The peak of my career there was in the eighth row, the ninth from the left in some series. I worked in Los Angeles for six months, and just for the same amount of time in New York City previously, and again – I did not clean the streets, but I worked as an actor.\\" – Kaimiņš explained why he believes he has better chance of reaching his full potential in Latvia and Russia than in the USA. = Radio Host = Kaimiņš has been a host of the radio programme ‘’Dog Kennel’’ (‘’Suņu Būda’’) on the station Boom FM. With this programme, he gained widespread recognition in Latvia. The host said that his aim with the broadcast is to awaken common sense in Latvian society and to stop lobbyists from influencing politicians. He has hosted a wide range of guests, including ex-president Vaira Vīķe- Freiberga, ex-prime minister Ivars Godmanis and various Latvian pop-culture stars. In these episodes, Kaimiņš tends to be controversial and calls out all of the flaws and problems that he sees with the establishment or the person he is interviewing.  Career in politics  = Latvian Association of Regions = Artuss Kaimiņš was elected in 2014 as the person with most votes for an individual in Latvia. He ran as a member of the Latvian Association of Regions when he was elected to the 12th Latvian Parliament. The next year, he left the party for several reasons. According to Kaimiņš, he objected to his party's potential endorsement of Solvita Āboltiņa for the post of Prime Minister and certain party policies. He himself has also said that the personal intentions of other members of the Latvian Association of Regions were not beneficial for the party and came before all policies and reasoning. Kaimiņš is known for having a camera with him most of the time. He captures what happens in the parliament and publishes it on his YouTube channel, showing his perceived flaws in the Latvian Parliament. = Who owns the state? = On May 3, 2016 he started his own new political movement Who owns the state? (Kam pieder valsts, abbreviated as KPV LV). This party is characterised as anti-establishment populist. Polls show that the average voter for this party would be a Latvian speaking young adult male. Kaimiņš states that KPV LV is not a populist party, citing a specific programme, which he briefly describes as follows: \\"Our party is a party that defends the interests of Latvian taxpayers.\\" There has been criticism of the party from ex-members who have chosen to leave KPV LV. Journalist Ilmārs Poikāns, who was one of the more well-known members of the party, revealed that he did not like Kaimiņš's style of leadership. Certain promises were broken, for instance, the lawyer Aldis Gobzems was nominated to run for Mayor of Riga in the municipal elections, even though Kaimiņš had said that he would not be nominated by the party.  Legal troubles  Coming back from a business trip to Lisbon in 2016, Kaimiņš was accused of behaving aggressively towards a flight attendant when he complained that announcements concerning arrangements for transit passengers were being made only in English and Russian and not Latvian, even though they were in Latvian airspace at a time when Latvia held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. He videoed the conversation and refused to delete the film, at which point he was informed that the police would be alerted. When the plane landed, got a chat with a flight attendant about the languages on a video and when she asked him to delete it, he refused. When plane had landed in Riga, Kaimiņš was indeed met by the police and was briefly detained, although he insists he voluntarily reported to the police. In 2014, following the annual Latvian theatre awards ceremony Spēlmaņu nakts a press photographer pressed charges against Kaimiņš, accusing him of humiliation and physical and verbal harassment. The case was brought before the Ethics Committee of the Saeima, before which he has also been summoned subsequently. Artuss Kaimiņš has repeatedly been blamed for promoting alcohol in his video blogs and interviews as a radio host in Boom FM. The radio station is not registered as a media outlet so it is not regulated by the government. On 21 June 2018, the Saeima Mandates, Ethics and Submissions Committee granted permission for Kaimiņš to be detained and searched with regard to an ongoing corruption investigation.

The cafe is located on the west bank of the Caen Canal, at the northwest end of the Bénouville Bridge, now commonly referred to as the Pegasus Bridge. The building was the site of first combat during the D-Day invasion, and is best known for its role commemorating those events. History Howard's Horsa gliders landed a hundred yards from the bridge. The Café Gondrée can be seen in the background The Bénouville Bridge, 9 June 1944. Howard's wrecked gliders can be seen in the background The two-story red brick building was built at the end of the 19th century. The nearby Bénouville Bridge was a key objective of the British 6th Airborne Division. A unit of Glider infantry of the division's 2nd Battalion was to land, take the bridge intact and hold it until relieved. The unit was led by Major John Howard. Howard and his men boarded three gliders. Released at 8,000 feet in the pitch black of a storm filled night, all three gliders managed to make a rough landing in a field almost directly on top of their objective. Leaving the broken gliders, the men engaged in a short, fierce firefight which ended with the British paratroopers in control of the bridge. Three British paratroopers entered the café at 6:20 am on 6 June 1944, thereby liberating it. At the time of these events the café was run by Georges and Thérèse Gondrée. They had been involved in the French Resistance, and had passed on information about the defenses around the bridge to British intelligence through the French underground. The successful taking of the bridge played an important role in limiting the effectiveness of a German counter-attack in the days and weeks following the Normandy invasion. With the passing of the Gondrées, ownership was taken over by their daughter, Arlette Gondrée, who was a little girl of 5 at the time of their liberation. A determined, fiery woman, she is famously referred to simply as \\"Madame\\".

The walls of the café are decorated with shoulder patch badges, regimental insignia, old uniforms, helmets and photos of the leaders of the operation. The café was also a destination for speakers at the military lectures that the war colleges put on in Normandy in the summers each year. Officers involved in the Normandy battles were asked by the war colleges to return to Normandy and speak of their experiences fighting there, and included such men as Major General \\"Pip\\" Roberts, Brigadier David Stileman, Major John Howard and Colonel Hans von Luck, an officer with the 21st Panzer Division. Because the owners were still severely anti-German, Howard covered for Luck by passing him off as Swedish. The Café Gondrée still serves as a café, though it is now known as the Pegasus Bridge Café. On 5 June 1987 it was listed as an Historical Monument.

From around 1821 on she became a Free Trader, continuing to trade with India under a license from the EIC. She also made two voyages transporting convicts to New South Wales (1834), and Tasmania (1852). She made several voyages carrying immigrants to South Australia, New South Wales, and British Guiana. She foundered in November 1865. EIC voyages William Fairlie (1754 – 1825) East India Company Merchant, Financier and Ship Owner, by Sir Henry Raeburn Fairlie cost 130,000 rupees to build.

She reached Madras on 30 August and St Helena on 3 December, and arrived at The Downs on 26 February. EIC voyage #2 (1812–1814): Captain D'Esteree acquired a letter of marque on 30 November 1811. He sailed from Portsmouth on 3 June 1812, bound for Batavia, Madras, and Bengal. Fairlie reached Madeira on 18 June and arrived at Saugor on 5 December. She then sailed on to Penang (28 March 1813) and Malacca (7 April). On 21 April, Fairlie grounded on a coral shoal at , which is about 100 miles north of Jakarta and the channel to the west of Bangka Island. This shoal became known as \\"Fairlie Rock\\", or more currently \\"Fairlie Klip\\" or \\"Fairlie Rif\\". Apparently Fairlie got off the shoal without material damage. On 1 May, Fairlie reached Batavia. She sailed to Samarang, which she reached on 26 May, before returning to Batavia on 18 June. By 18 July, Fairlie was again at Madras, and by 17 August Kidderpore. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 2 November, the Cape of Good Hope on 1 March 1814, and St Helena on 18 March.

Homeward bound, she was at the New Anchorage on 3 October, and Bombay on 8 December. She was at Tellichery on 2 January 1819, reached St Helena on 26 March, and arrived at Blackwall on 8 June. Free trader In 1813, the EIC lost its monopoly on the trade between Britain and India; it retained its monopoly on the trade between Britain and China. Many vessels then entered the trade with India, becoming Free Traders sailing under licenses from the EIC. Fairlies owners gave up their status as an EIC regular ship and converted to Free Trader status. Fairlie continue to trade between Britain and India, and later South America, but also began transporting convicts and carrying migrants. First convict voyage (1833–1834): Captain Henry Ager sailed from England on 27 October 1833 and arrived at Sydney on 15 February 1834.

The show currently airs weeknights live from 9:00pm to 10:00pm ET, with a replay at 1:00am to 2:00am ET, originally from Time Warner Center in New York City, and since late 2019 from its new studios at Time Warner's new base at 30 Hudson Yards, also in New York City. A few editions are also broadcast from CNN's studios in Washington, D.C. Interviewees On the opening night, Cuomo interviewed White House Attorney Rudy Giuliani in the first One on One interview, and asked him to explain apparent discrepancies in the Trump Tower story, in which President Trump contradicted an earlier categorical assurance, repeated many times over, that he had no hand in drafting a statement about his son's presence at a meeting at Trump Tower in which a Russian intelligence operative was allegedly present. Giuliani said: \\"It was a mistake. I swear to God\\". Other interviewees in the show's first week included Bernie Sanders and former White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci. Background Cuomo Prime Time was first broadcast for a week-long trial run in August 2017. A second, month-long, run occurred in January 2018. The show is the first major change to CNN's evening schedule for several years, which until the show's launch typically consisted of two hours each for the news analysis shows Anderson Cooper 360° (8 p.m. — 10 p.m. E.T.) and CNN Tonight with Don Lemon (10 p.m. — 12 midnight E.T.). A format established by Cuomo as one of two main co-hosts of the weekday edition of CNN's New Day, a three-hour morning news show, consists of an in-depth interview with a leading newsmaker (usually a senior public figure such as a politician, legal advocate or a celebrity in a public campaign), and it became an important part of Cuomo Prime Time during the show's two trial runs. CNN's audience share has grown in recent years, but still lags behind that of Fox News and MSNBC during prime time. In the 25 to 54-year-old demographic, during February 2018, Fox News' Hannity averaged 711,000 viewers, MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show averaged 641,000, but Anderson Cooper 360° lagged behind at 386,000 average viewers. However, during its January trial run, Cuomo Prime Time tied with CNN's highest-rated show, Anderson Cooper 360°, among television viewers in the important 25-54 age ranges. But CNN's Executive Vice President of Programming, Michael Bass, argues that chasing ratings is much less important to CNN than establishing a viable new programming format, and that the change is needed because CNN sometimes airs non-live programs at 9pm E.T., such as documentaries and features, and instead \\"needs to be live\\" at a time when potentially important news stories are developing. Cuomo Prime Time is scheduled to directly compete with Fox News' Hannity and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, which both consist of partisan political commentary from their respective presenters, in contrast to the analytical approach of CNN, in which a wide range of experts and political veterans with differing opinions are interviewed in large studio- based panel discussions. Cuomo says that he recognizes that both Maddow and Hannity have high ratings: \\"They have huge numbers. I have huge respect for their success, and I take nothing away from them...But the point is, I don’t know where their partisan fights are getting us\\". Cuomo says that his interviews will feature newsmakers whom he will challenge if their statements are non-factual, and that his new show will encourage \\"debating with decency\\". He describes his approach as one where \\"You have to hold people to answer the questions. There is too much evasiveness, too much pandering, too much playing with the facts. You have to cut out the bias\\". He also says that \\"people are making the choice to be all in on one side. And unfortunately, while it's being done in the name of balance and in the name of truth, it's really just deepening the divide. That's feeding this move towards the tribal. I think that's a mistake\\". Cuomo says that his new show \\"will not be tethered to the TV studio\\" and that he will travel more frequently for live broadcasts to the scenes of big breaking news. During a recent edition of The Axe Files podcast, the host David Axelrod asked Cuomo about the title of Cuomo Prime Time, and he responded that none of the “trappings” of the program matter to him and that during the January 2018 [second] trial run, he \\"wore the same suit every night for a month\\". Format The show opens with a run-down of several program segments and the naming of guests. The segments consist of the following: * Opening Statement — Cuomo on most kickoff segments would talk about the recent news, and combines them with his own talking points of the morals and ethics of society in a compelling speech; * One on One — As the title implies, an in- depth interview with a single guest. There will sometimes be more than one of this segment per show; * The Great Debate — Two guests argue over opposing viewpoints of a contentious issue, where unproven or untruthful statements are challenged; * @The Whiteboard — A point-by-point overview of a top news story, with Cuomo drawing on a vertical whiteboard to highlight key points and connections between them * Cuomo's Court * Closing Argument References External links * Official program website * Official program Twitter account * Category:2017 American television series debuts Category:2010s American television talk shows Category:CNN original programming Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Cuomo Prime Time"},{"id":"57379089","text":"James Francis Lagan (1947 – 5 May 2018), better known as Séamus Lagan, was a Gaelic footballer from Northern Ireland.

It was first observed on 17 January 2015, by astronomers with the Dark Energy Survey at Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile. The \\"likely\\" dwarf planet measures approximately in diameter. It has been described as an extended scattered disc object (ESDO), and fits into the group of extreme objects that led to the prediction of Planet Nine, and has the highest orbital inclination of any of these objects.  Orbit and classification  Caju orbits the Sun at a distance of 35.2–821 AU once every 8856 years (3,234,488 days; semi-major axis of 428 AU). Its orbit has an exceptionally high eccentricity of 0.92 and an inclination of 54° with respect to the ecliptic. This makes it a probable outlier among the known extreme trans-Neptunian objects. = Planet Nine = Caju fits into the group of extreme trans- Neptunian objects that originally led to the prediction of Planet Nine. The group consists of more than a dozen bodies with a perihelion greater than 30 AU and a semi-major axis greater than 250 AU, with Caju having the highest orbital inclination of any of these objects. Subsequently, unrefereed work by de la Fuente Marcos (2018) found that Caju current orbital orientation in space is not easily explained by the same mechanism that keeps other extreme trans-Neptunian objects together, suggesting that the clustering in its orbital angles cannot be attributed to Planet Nine's influence. However, regardless of the current direction of its orbit, its high orbital inclination appears to fit into the class of high-semi major axis, high-inclination objects predicted by Batygin & Morbedelli (2017) to be generated by Planet Nine.  Numbering and naming  The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken on 27 November 2014 by astronomers with the Dark Energy Survey using the DECam instrument of the Victor M. Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Its discovery was reported in a paper published by Dark Energy Survey astronomers in 2018.  Physical characteristics  According to Michael Brown and the Johnston's archive, Caju measures 524 and 584 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.08 and 0.09, respectively. Michael Brown lists this object on his website as a \\"likely\\" dwarf planet (500–600 km) based on his 5-class taxonomic system that ranges from \\"nearly certainly\\" to \\"possibly\\".

Discussions in incel forums are often characterized by resentment, misogyny, misanthropy, self-pity and self- loathing, racism, a sense of entitlement to sex, and the endorsement of violence against sexually active people. The American nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center(SPLC) described the subculture as \\"part of the online male supremacist ecosystem\\" that is included in their list of hate groups. Incels are mostly male and heterosexual, and many sources report that incels are predominantly white. Estimates of the overall size of the subculture vary greatly, ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands. At least six mass murders, resulting in a total of 44 deaths, have been committed since 2014 by men who have either self-identified as incels or who had mentioned incel- related names and writings in their private writings or Internet postings. Incel communities have been criticized by the media and researchers for being misogynistic, encouraging violence, spreading extremist views, and radicalizing their members. Beginning in 2018, the incel ideology has increasingly been described as a terrorism threat, and a February 2020 attack in Toronto, Canada became the first instance of allegedly incel-related violence to be prosecuted as an act of terrorism.  History  The first online community to use the term \\"incel\\" was started in 1993 when a Canadian university student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others. The website, titled \\"Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project\\", was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences. In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, later shortened to \\"incel\\", for \\"anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time\\". During her college years and after, Alana realized she was bisexual and became more comfortable with her identity. She stopped participating in her online project around 2000 and gave the site to a stranger. In 2018, Alana said of her project, \\"It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years.\\" When she read about the 2014 Isla Vista killings, and that parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, she wrote, \\"Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it.\\" She expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an \\"inclusive community\\" for people of all genders who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness. The message board love- shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who felt perpetually rejected or were extremely shy with potential partners to discuss their situations. It was less strictly moderated than its counterpart, IncelSupport, which was also founded in the 2000s, and while IncelSupport welcomed men and women and banned misogynistic posts, love-shy.com's userbase was overwhelmingly male. Over the next decade, the membership of love-shy.com and other online communities like 4chan increasingly overlapped. In the 2000s, incel communities became more extremist as they adopted behaviors common on forums like 4chan and Reddit, where extremist posts were encouraged as a way to achieve visibility. As edgy and extremist statements became more prevalent in incel communities, so too did extremist trolling and \\"shitposting\\". The /r/incels subreddit, a forum on the website Reddit, later became a particularly active incel community. It was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other forms of violence, and were misogynistic and often racist. One post titled \\"general question about how rapists get caught\\" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist. On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that banned \\"content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people\\". Reddit banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under the policy's purview. At the time of the ban, the community had around 40,000 members. After the subreddit was shut down the incel community continued to inhabit Reddit in various other subreddits, such as on the subreddit /r/braincels. Although the tone of the subreddit was similar to /r/incels, moderators of the /r/braincels forum said that they did not endorse, support, or glorify violence or violent people, a distinction they made from the subject matter of its predecessor that resulted in its being banned from Reddit. The /r/braincels subreddit was banned later, however, on September 30, 2019 after Reddit again broadened its banning policy. Incels came to wider public notice with the banning of /r/incels and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either identified as incels or shared similar ideologies. Increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to feelings of \\"aggrieved entitlement\\" among some men who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women for their lack of sex. Incel communities have become more extremist and focused on violence in recent years. This has been attributed to various factors, including influence from overlapping online hate groups and the rise of the alt-right and white supremacist groups. The misogynistic and sometimes violent rhetoric of some incels has led to numerous bans from websites and webhosts. Incel communities continue to exist on more lenient platforms, such as Reddit, 4chan, 8chan, Voat, and Gab. More extremist incels have increasingly migrated to obscure locations including gaming chat services and the dark web to avoid site shutdowns and the self-censorship that has developed among some incel communities as an effort to avoid drawing scrutiny from law enforcement or website service providers. Beginning in 2018 and increasing into 2020, the incel ideology has been described by governments and researchers as a terrorism threat, and law enforcement have issued warnings about the subculture. In May 2019, an American man was sentenced to up to five years in prison for attempting to make terrorist threats for posting on social media, \\"I'm planning on shooting up a public place... killing as many girls as I see.\\" In September 2019, the U.S. Army warned soldiers about the possibility of violence at movie theaters showing the Joker film, after \\"disturbing and very specific chatter\\" was found in conversations among incels on the dark web. A January 2020 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety warned that incels are an \\"emerging domestic terrorism threat\\". A 2020 paper published by Bruce Hoffman and colleagues in Studies in Conflict & Terrorism concluded that \\"the violent manifestations of the ideology pose a new terrorism threat, which should not be dismissed or ignored by domestic law enforcement agencies.\\" Dr. John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State University who in 2019 received a $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to study the incel subculture, explained why the incel ideology equates to terrorism: \\"the fact that incels are aspiring to change things up in a bigger, broader ideological sense, that's, for me, what make it a classic example of terrorism. That's not saying all incels are terrorists. But violent incel activity is, unquestionably, terrorism in my view.\\" In February 2020, an attack in Toronto that was allegedly motivated by incel ideologies became the first such act of violence to be prosecuted as terrorism, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated that they consider the incel subculture to be an Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremist (IMVE) movement.  Ideology  Many incel communities are characterized by resentment, self-pity, racism, misogyny, misanthropy, and narcissism.  Discussions often revolve around the belief that men are entitled to sex; other common topics include idleness, loneliness, unhappiness, suicide, sexual surrogates, and prostitutes, as well as various attributes they believe increase one's desirability as a partner such as income or personality. Opposition to feminism and women's rights is commonplace, and some posters blame women's liberation for their inability to find a partner. Some incels believe that there was a golden age in which couples married early, were strictly monogamous, and adhered to traditional gender roles. They believe that during this time, looks played less of a role in romantic pairings and men's \\"entitlement\\" to sex with women was never denied. While incels who hold this belief often disagree about precisely when this golden age occurred, they concur that it was gradually destroyed by feminism, the sexual revolution, women's liberation, and technological progress. Antisemitic beliefs are also regularly found on incel forums, with some posters going so far as to blame the rise of feminism on a plot masterminded by Jews to weaken the Western world. Incel communities are a part of the broader manosphere, a loose collection of misogynist movements that also includes men's rights activists, Men Going Their Own Way(MGTOW), pickup artists (PUA), and fathers' rights groups. Journalists for The New York Times have said that involuntary celibacy is an adaptation of the idea of \\"male supremacy\\" and that the communities have evolved into a movement \\"made up of people—some celibate, some not—who believe that women should be treated as sexual objects with few rights\\". The Southern Poverty Law Center also described the subculture as \\"part of the online male supremacist ecosystem\\", which they began including in their list of hate groups in 2018. While incels believe that they are physically inferior to the rest of society, often referring to themselves as \\"subhuman\\", researchers have agreed that incels also espouse supremacist views: either that they are superior to women, or superior to non-incels in general. A 2019 study published in Terrorism and Political Violence found that incels believe themselves to be the only ones who are \\"capable of pro-social values and intelligent enough ('high IQ') to see the truth about the social world.\\" The study determined that incels followed a pattern that is typical of extremist groups: ascribing highly negative values to out-groups and positive values to in-groups, with the unusual caveat that despite seeing themselves as psychologically superior, incels also view themselves negatively in terms of physical appearance. Incel communities sometimes overlap with communities such as Men Going Their Own Way, men's rights activism, people who believe they are experiencing \\"true forced loneliness\\" (TFL), and pickup artistry, although at least one incel website has expressed hatred for pickup artistry and accuses pickup artists and dating coaches of financially exploiting incels. The incel communities have also been observed to overlap with far-right groups, with the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right noting that incels \\"are part of a growing trend of radical-right movements\\" that are distressed by neoliberalism, especially women's empowerment and immigration. Hoffman and colleagues, publishing in Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, stated that \\"a particularly worrisome trend is how seamlessly the militant incel community has been integrated into the alt-right tapestry, with common grievances and intermingling membership bringing the two extremisms closer together.\\"2014 memorial service at Harder Stadium for the victims of the 2014 Isla Vista killings by self-identified incel Elliot Rodger Some discussions in incel communities endorse violence against sexually active women and more sexually successful men; harassment of women, including activities such as catfishing; and suicide among incels. According to the Anti-Defamation League, incels are the most violent community within the manosphere. In some communities, it is common for posts to glorify violence by self-identified incels such as Elliot Rodger (perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings) and Alek Minassian (2018 Toronto van attack suspect), as well as by those they believe shared their ideology such as Marc Lépine (perpetrator of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre), Seung-Hui Cho (perpetrator of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting), and George Sodini (perpetrator of the 2009 Collier Township shooting). Rodger is the most frequently referenced, with incels often referring to him as their \\"saint\\" and sharing memes in which his face has been superimposed onto paintings of Christian icons. Some incels consider him to be the true progenitor of today's online incel communities. Some incels see violence as the only solution to what they see as societal oppression and abuse against them, and speak frequently of incel \\"uprisings\\" and \\"revolts\\". Other incels take the more nihilistic view that nothing will change society, even violent acts. Some incels support the idea of violence as revenge on society, without the hope it will lead to societal change. A subgroup of incels who frequent websites run by Nathan Larson, a perennial political candidate and active participant in incel communities, work deliberately to convince other incels that they are justified in raping women if they are rejected sexually. Some incels describe women's sexual rejection of them as \\"reverse rape\\", a phenomenon they consider to be equally harmful as rape. Many incels justify their prejudices using interpretations taken from concepts such as biological determinism and evolutionary psychology. Other concepts that incels may believe in include female hypergamy; genetic superiority of men over women; the \\"80/20 rule\\" (an application of the Pareto principle) which suggests that 80% of women desire the top 20% of most attractive men; and, among non-whites, the \\"just be white\\" (JBW) theory, which suggests that Caucasians face the fewest obstacles when dating. Incels also believe that single people seeking a partner participate in a cruel, mercenary, and Darwinian sexual selection, wherein incels are genetically unfit and where women hold an advantage for reasons ranging from feminism to the use of cosmetics. Incels may attribute their lack of sexual success to factors such as shyness, sex-segregated work environments, negative body image, penis size, or their physical appearance, and commonly believe that the only thing more important than looks in improving a man's eligibility as a prospective partner is wealth. Some incels justify their beliefs based on the works of fringe social psychologist Brian Gilmartin and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson. = \\"Red pill\\" and \\"black pill\\" = The idea of the \\"red pill\\" is an allusion that is common among manosphere communities, as well as some communities outside of the manosphere. It originates from the dilemma in the movie The Matrix where the protagonist must choose whether to remain in a world of illusion (taking the blue pill) or to see the world as it really is (taking the red pill). Among communities that use the term, the \\"red pill\\" often refers to the core set of beliefs of that community, and people who are \\"redpilled\\" or who have \\"taken the red pill\\" are those who hold those beliefs. In manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and, according to some researchers, in incel communities as well, \\"taking the red pill\\" means seeing a world where feminism has given women too much power over men and male privilege does not exist. The \\"black pill\\" is an extension of the red and blue pill analogy. There is some disagreement among researchers and journalists over which beliefs are \\"red pill\\" and which are \\"black pill\\", and whether the black pill ideology is a distinguishing belief of incels or if there are incels who do not subscribe to black pill ideas. Some researchers and journalists use the term \\"red pill\\" to refer to the set of beliefs commonly held by men’s rights’ activists, and the term \\"black pill\\" to summarize the incel ideology as a whole. Hoffman et al. have said that \\"'Taking the black pill' is critical to the incel identity, since it means recognizing 'inceldom' as a permanent condition.\\" Aja Romano writing for Vox has said, \\"what unites all incels is something known as the black pill.\\" However, researchers at the Anti-Defamation League write that there are some incels who believe in the red pill and others who believe in the black pill. The \\"black pill\\" generally refers to a set of commonly-held beliefs in incel communities, which include biological determinism, fatalism, and defeatism for unattractive people. Someone who believes in the black pill is referred to as \\"blackpilled\\". The black pill has been described by Vox correspondent Zack Beauchamp as \\"a profoundly sexist ideology that... amounts to a fundamental rejection of women's sexual emancipation, labeling women shallow, cruel creatures who will choose only the most attractive men if given the choice.\\" The term was first popularized on the blog Omega Virgin Revolt, where it represented a belief that the entire social system was broken and that one's place in the system was not something any individual could change. An incel who has \\"taken the black pill\\" has adopted the belief that they are hopeless, and that their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance, personality, or other characteristics. Researchers at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have said that incels can also follow the red pill ideology. Those who believe they can improve their chances with women are adherents to the red pill, whereas only incels who believe they have no power to change their position in society or chances with women are blackpilled. The ADL writes that, among incels, the beliefs summarized as \\"red pill\\" center around the idea that feminism has unbalanced society to favor women and give them too much power. It includes the belief that 80% of women are attracted to the top 20% of men, an application of the Pareto principle that is referred to among incels as the \\"80/20 rule\\", and the belief in \\"hypergamy\\", or that women will abandon a man if they are presented with the opportunity to have sex with or enter into a relationship with a more attractive man. \\"Redpilled\\" incels believe they have the opportunity to fight back against this system which disadvantages them, which they do by trying to make themselves more attractive to women. Conversely, blackpilled incels are those who believe they can do nothing to change their situation. The ADL writes, \\"This is where the incel movement takes on characteristics of a death cult.\\" Those who have taken the black pill are left with few options, says the ADL: giving up on life (referred to by incels as \\"LDAR\\", an abbreviation for \\"lie down and rot\\"), committing suicide, or committing mass violence. On the former incel subreddit /r/braincels, the term \\"blackpill\\" was also used to refer to memes (usually images) that users shared to describe a user's thoughts, many of which criticized women as egocentric, cruel, and shallow. Lexicology The term \\"involuntary celibate\\" (shortened to \\"incel\\") refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, a state they describe as \\"inceldom\\" or \\"incelibacy\\". It is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms, such as \\"love-shy\\" (describing those with social anxiety or excessive shyness preventing romantic success), \\"FA\\" (short for \\"forever alone\\"), \\"unfuckability\\", \\"omegas\\", \\"betas\\", \\"the undersexed\\", or \\"the sexless\\". Alana, the coiner of the term incel, initially considered using other terms such as \\"perpetually single\\" or \\"dating shy\\". Members of incel communities regularly use jargon and a distinct dialect. Incels often use dehumanizing and vulgar terms for women, such as \\"femoids\\" (which they sometimes shorten to \\"foids\\") and \\"roasties\\" (a reference to the labia minora, which incels believe changes shape after a woman becomes sexually active and begins to resemble sliced roast beef). Incels refer to attractive sexually active women as \\"stacys\\", less attractive sexually active women as \\"beckys\\", and attractive sexually active men as \\"chads\\". People who are average looking and not incels are \\"normies\\". \\"Mogging\\" refers to the act of eclipsing another person in terms of physical appearance and thereby undermining them. \\"Looksmaxing\\" is an attempt at enhancing one's appearance by methods including getting a haircut and dressing nicely, taking steroids and working out, or undergoing plastic surgery. The abbreviation \\"NEET\\" refers to people who do not have jobs and are not attending school: \\"not in education, employment, or training\\". Members of incel communities use many variations of the term \\"incel\\" to refer to subgroups within the community, such as \\"volcels\\" (voluntary celibate; someone who chooses to forego sexual intercourse), \\"fakecels\\" (those who claim to be incel, but in reality have recently had sex or been in a relationship), and \\"truecels\\" (true incels; men who have never had any sexual or romantic encounters). There are also a number of race-based variations of the term \\"incel\\" which refer to people who believe their race is the reason behind their inability to find a partner, including \\"currycels\\" (people of South Asian ancestry) and \\"ricecels\\" (those of Chinese or Southeast Asian backgrounds), or collectively, \\"ethnicels\\". The term \\"incel\\" is sometimes used as an insult to label men who are seen as undesirable, but who are not part of the online community. Demographics Self-identified incels are mostly male and heterosexual, and are often described as young and friendless introverts. Estimates of the size of incel communities vary, and range from the thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands. Many sources describe incels as predominantly white. Sociologist Ross Haenfler was quoted in The Washington Post describing them as primarily white. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center echoed this to NBC News, saying they are \\"young, frustrated white males in their late teens into their early twenties who are having a hard time adjusting to adulthood\\". Jaki and colleagues, publishing linguistic analysis of a large incel forum in The Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict in June 2019, contended that \\"contrary to what is often reported\\" there was no definitive evidence that the group is predominantly white, and that \\"it is impossible to say whether the majority of ... users are white men, but our data implies that this may be less true than expected. They suggested that the various mentions of race on the forum \\"may reflect, to some extent, the ethnic variety of the forum\\". However, Hoffman and colleagues, publishing in Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, reported that a March 2020 survey of the same forum determined that most respondents self-identified as Caucasian. Some media outlets depict incels as unemployed (\\"NEET\\") and living with parents. Incels are mainly located in North America and Europe, although there are also incel communities for people outside the Anglosphere, such as the Italian website Il Forum dei Brutti. The English language forums also receive much traffic from non-anglophone countries. Research published in 2020 by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) on the three largest incel forums found they had a total of about 20,000 users, with only about 1,000 who post actively. The FOI found that between 4.6–7.3% of the visitors to the forums originated from Sweden, though they caution this may not be accurate given the use of personal VPNs. The incel subculture includes people who are in sexless marriages (or other sexless relationships) but who wish to be sexually active. Asexual people and those who are voluntarily sexually abstinent are not considered incels. =Female incels= The first incel website, Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project, was gender-inclusive. There are present day women-specific incel forums, such as /r/Femcels, /r/TruFemcels, and /r/ForeverAloneWomen. Nonetheless, there is disagreement in online incel communities on whether women can be incels, with some claiming that male incels grossly outnumber female incels, others claiming that it is impossible for women to be an incel at all, others claiming that only women with a physical deformity can be incels, and others arguing that only unattractive women belonging to the \\"bottom percentile in terms of appearance\\" can be incels. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the majority of incels do not believe women can be incels. Tens of thousands of self-identifying female incels, also called \\"femcels\\", are reported to populate the internet. Their most popular site is r/TruFemcels on Reddit, with over 22,000 members. Journalists have written that outside of the female incels' own communities, few believe women can genuinely experience involuntary celibacy. Some female incels believe they could have casual sex, but fear it would only be from men who would abuse or disrespect them. Women who identify as incels share some similarities with their male counterparts, such as belief that physical appearance is the most important factor in finding a partner. In other ways they tend to be different; for example, according to journalist Isabelle Kohn, rather than being angry at the men who reject them, they empathize with the men for not wanting to date them. Kohn notes the tendency for female incels to turn their rage inwards, rather than outwards like males. Journalist Arwa Mahdawi hypothesizes that the fact female incels do not go on violent rampages like some male incels is the most obvious reason why female incels have not received much attention in mainstream media. As of February 2020, Kohn wrote that she could find \\"mountains\\" of academic papers on male incels, but none on female incels. She says the assumption that female incels do not exist adds to their pain. Mental health \\"Involuntary celibacy\\" is not a medical or psychological condition. Some people who identify as incel have physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Some visitors of incel forums attribute their inability to find a partner to physical or mental ailments, while some others attribute it to extreme introversion. Many incels engage in self-diagnosis of mental health issues, and members of incel communities often discourage posters who post about mental illness from seeing therapists or otherwise seeking treatment. Some incels with severe depression are also suicidal, and some members of incel communities encourage suicidal members to kill themselves, sometimes recommending they commit acts of mass violence before doing so.  Mass murders and violence  Several mass murders and other violent attacks have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies. = 2000s = On August 4, 2009, George Sodini opened fire at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three women were murdered and nine other people were injured before Sodini killed himself. He purportedly expressed sexual frustration and complained of constant rejections by women on a website registered in his name. In the years following the shooting, Sodini has been embraced by some incel communities. = 2010s = Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others before killing himself in Isla Vista, California on May 23, 2014, near the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and YouTube videos in which he detailed his involuntary celibacy and discussed how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women. He had been an active member of a community popular among incels called PUAHate (short for \\"pickup artist hate\\"), and referenced it several times in his manifesto. Although PUAHate shut down soon after the attack, Rodger became something of a martyr to some communities that remained, and to some of those that emerged later. It is common to see references to \\"E.R.\\" in incel forums, and mass violence by incels is regularly referred to as \\"going E.R.\\" Rodger has been referenced by the perpetrators or suspected perpetrators of several other mass killings, and is one of several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities. Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a shooting at the Umpqua Community College campus on October 1, 2015 in Roseburg, Oregon. He left a manifesto at the scene, outlining his interest in other mass murders including the Isla Vista killings, his anger at not having a girlfriend, and his animus towards the world. In his journal writings, he had related with Elliot Rodger and other mass shooters, describing them as \\"people who stand with the gods\\". Before the attack, when someone on an online message board had speculated Harper-Mercer was \\"saving himself for someone special\\", Harper-Mercer had replied: 'involuntarily so.\\" Several hours before the shooting, someone suspected to be Harper-Mercer posted a threat to a Pacific Northwest college to /r9k/, a 4chan board with many incel posters. On July 31, 2016, Sheldon Bentley robbed and killed an unconscious man in an alleyway in Edmonton, Alberta. During his trial, Bentley said he killed the man by stomping on his abdomen because he was frustrated with stress from his job as a security guard and with being involuntarily celibate for four years. William Atchison killed two people before killing himself on December 7, 2017 in Aztec, New Mexico, in a shooting at Aztec High School, where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym \\"Elliot Rodger\\" on several online forums, and praised \\"the supreme gentleman\\" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since become a common reference among incel communities). Atchison had also posted far-right content online. On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz was accused of killing seventeen people and injured seventeen others in a shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Allegedly also motivated by other extremist views, Cruz had previously posted online that \\"Elliot Rodger will not be forgotten\\". After an April 23, 2018 vehicle-ramming attack in Toronto, Ontario, Alek Minassian was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. Shortly before the attack, Minassian had allegedly posted on Facebook that \\"the Incel Rebellion has already begun\\" and applauded Rodger. The term \\"Incel Rebellion\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"Beta Uprising\\", which refers to a violent response to incels' perceived sexual deprivation. Following the attack, a poster on a website created to supersede /r/incels wrote about Minassian, \\"I hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint.\\" Following the attack, police claimed that Minassian had been radicalized by incel communities. A video interview was later released in showing Minassian being interrogated by police shortly after the attacks. In the video, Minassian is shown telling police that he was a virgin, and that he was motivated by a resentment of \\"Chads and Staceys\\", as well as women who gave \\"their love and affection to obnoxious brutes\\" rather than to him. The video also showed Minassian saying that he hoped the alleged attack would \\"inspire future masses to join me\\" in committing acts of violence as a part of the \\"Beta Uprising\\". On November 2, 2018, Scott Beierle killed two women and injured four women and a man before killing himself in a shooting at the Hot Yoga Tallahassee studio in Tallahassee, Florida. He had been a follower of incel ideologies for a long time, and also had a history of arrests for grabbing women's buttocks. In 2014 he posted several YouTube videos of himself espousing extreme hatred for women and expressing anger over not having a girlfriend, mentioning Elliot Rodger in one video. In the months leading up to the shooting, he posted numerous misogynistic, racist, violent, and homophobic songs to SoundCloud. In January 2019, Christopher Cleary was arrested for posting on Facebook that he was \\"planning on shooting up a public place soon and being the next mass shooter\\" and \\"killing as many girls as I see\\" because he had never had a girlfriend and was a virgin. He has been described as an incel in the media. In May 2019, Cleary was sentenced to up to five years in prison for an attempted threat of terrorism. Bryan Isaack Clyde began what was intended to be a mass shooting at the Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse in Dallas, Texas on June 17, 2019, but was shot and fatally wounded by officers from the Federal Protective Service before he injured anyone. Clyde had shared incel memes on social media, along with other posts referencing right-wing beliefs and conspiracy theories. Following the incident, the Joint Base Andrews military base briefed its personnel on incels, with a spokesman describing them as \\"a very real threat to military members and civilians.\\" Incels have also praised attackers with unclear motives who they believe to be incels. After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, some of the incel community celebrated the shooter Stephen Paddock, who they felt was a hero who was targeting \\"normies\\". After the 2018 Toronto shooting, posters on an incel message board expressed excitement with the possibility that the perpetrator might be an incel, although no motive has been identified. = 2020s = Tobias Rathjen committed two mass shootings in Hanau, Germany on February 19, 2020, killing ten people and himself, and leaving behind a manifesto described by Insider as \\"delusional\\". Some media sources reported that Rathjen self-identified as an incel in the manifesto; others said that he did not use the term. The manifesto included racist and paranoid writings, where Rathjen called for the extermination of non-white people and claimed he had not had a relationship with a woman because the government had been monitoring him. On February 24, 2020, a female spa worker was stabbed to death in an attack that also severely injured her female coworker at an erotic massage parlor in Toronto. On May 19, the Toronto Police Service declared the attack was being treated as a terrorist incident after evidence pointed to the stabbings being motivated by incel ideology, and police laid charges against a 17-year-old male alleged to have committed the stabbings. This was the first time violence thought to be motivated by incel ideologies was prosecuted as an act of terrorism, and is also believed to be the first act of violence not perpetrated by an Islamist extremist to be prosecuted as terrorism in Canada. Armando Hernandez Jr. allegedly opened fire on May 20, 2020, at Westgate Entertainment District, a mixed-use development in Glendale, Arizona, before being arrested by police. A 19-year-old man was critically injured, while a 30-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl suffered minor injuries. According to the Maricopa County prosecutor, Hernandez identified himself as an incel and claimed he wanted to target couples and shoot at least ten people. The prosecutor said, \\"Mr. Hernandez is a self- professed incel.... He was taking out his anger at society, the feeling that he has been bullied, the feeling that women didn't want him.\\" The prosecutor also alleged that Hernandez sent a video of the attack to a woman he wished to impress. Between January and , five self-identified incels were arrested in North America for planning to kill women. Among them was Cole Carini, a man who was charged with making false statements to law enforcement in June 2020 after claiming serious injuries to his hands had been caused by a lawnmower accident. Police alleged that Carini was actually injured while trying to make a bomb, and that he had written a note threatening violence against women and referencing Elliot Rodger.  Criticism  = Of incels = Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist. Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums \\"play[s] a very large role\\" in the radicalization of incels, and describes incel forums as having \\"more violent rhetoric than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites\\". Journalist David Futrelle has described incel communities as \\"violently misogynistic\\", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups. Psychologist and sex researcher James Cantor has described incels as \\"a group of people who usually lack sufficient social skills and... find themselves very frustrated.\\" He has said that in incel forums \\"when they're surrounded by other people with similar frustrations, they kind of lose track of what typical discourse is, and they drive themselves into more and more extreme beliefs.\\" Senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue(ISD), Amarnath Amarasingam, has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying \\"under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence\\". Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders, and to online campaigns convincing people to join ISIL. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude \\"can go as far as the justification of rape\\". While generally agreeing with critics' concerns about misogyny and other negative characteristics in the incel subculture, some commentators have been more sympathetic towards incels. In April 2018, economist Robin Hanson wrote a blog post likening access to sex with access to income, writing that he found it puzzling that similar concern had not been shown to incels as to low income individuals. Hanson was criticized by some for discussing sex as if it was a commodity; others wrote more positively about his opinions. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote a similarly controversial op-ed in May 2018 titled \\"The Redistribution of Sex\\" in which he suggested sex robots and sex workers would inevitably be called upon to satisfy incels' sexual desires. Some commentators wrote articles agreeing with this view, including Toby Young, who agreed that sex robots could be a \\"workable solution\\"; others criticized the column for objectifying women and for legitimizing the incel ideology. Journalist Zack Beauchamp has expressed concern about other types of harm inflicted by incels that may be lost in the attention paid specifically to mass violence; he points to forum posts in which users brag about yelling at, catfishing, and sexually assaulting women. University of Portsmouth lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a \\"networked misogyny\\", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of hate speech but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize \\"impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men\\". Some sociological research on incel communities has analyzed them as a hybrid masculinity, in which privileged men distance themselves from hegemonic masculinity while simultaneously reproducing it. = Of platforms providing services to incel communities = Criticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (which banned the /r/incels community in 2017, and banned most of the remaining incel communities in September 2019, but is still home to some incels) and Twitter. Cloudflare, which provides services including DDoS protection and caching so that webpages are still accessible when a site is offline, has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against downtime even when webhosts have terminated service. = Of media reporting on incels = Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its \\"breathless\\" coverage, for normalizing incel communities by describing them as \\"sexually frustrated\\", and for directing readers to incel communities. Some reporting has also been criticized for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length, or for victim blaming by implying that women who had rejected the attackers' romantic or sexual advances held some responsibility for provoking the attacks. Those who have written sympathetically about incels have faced criticism for legitimizing the incel ideology, such as from Samantha Cole in Vice who condemned media outlets who \\"cove[r] and amplif[y] toxic internet culture as if it's valid ideology\\".  In popular culture  Two episodes of the American crime drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit are based on incels. In season 16, the episode \\"Holden's Manifesto\\" is based on Elliot Rodger and the 2014 Isla Vista killings. In season 20, the episode \\"Revenge\\" features a group of incels who attack the targets of each others' obsession to exact revenge while creating alibis for one another. Fair Warning, a 2020 thriller novel by Michael Connelly, features a company that buys genetic test data on women genetically identified as vulnerable to sex addiction. The company sells their names and addresses to incels, one of whom is a serial killer. The main character of Whatever, a 1994 novel by French author Michel Houellebecq, has been labelled by Adam Kirsch of The New York Times as a \\"proto-incel\\" with the novel as a whole being retrospectively evaluated as predictive of the modern incel movement. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1999.

His war career alternated between flying in operational squadrons and serving as an aide for senior commanders. His many appointments gave him the opportunity to view the events of the European War from a command level as well as an operational level. Following the war he spent a brief amount of time as an airline pilot before returning to the RAF. He represented the RAF at a series of NATO conferences, where he formed valuable relationships with a number of national leaders. He had a lifelong interest in aeromodeling, and was a worldwide figure in that hobby. He is best known for leading the low-level daylight raid against the Philips plant in Eindhoven, known as Operation Oyster. Early life 17 yo James Pelly-Fry (left) holds model airplane \\"Wapati II\\" while it is being wound by Dutch designer Juste van Hattum, 1929 James Ernest Pelly-Fry was born on 22 November 1911. His father was a tea merchant. The family lived in Colombo in Sri Lanka, what was then called Ceylon. When Pelly-Fry was 5 years old the family returned to England so that the children could attend school, while his father stayed in Ceylon. The family moved to the home of his grandmother and aunt in Epping, in the county of Essex. Pelly-Fry was educated at Douai School in Berkshire. His father died nine years later, at the age of 50. Pelly-Fry left school soon thereafter and went to work in the accounts department of the P&O; Shipping Company. Two years later he was apprenticed to the tea company Joseph Tetley and Son. The home in Epping happened to be located close to the RAF airfield at North Weald, which provided young Pelly-Fry with many opportunities to observe aircraft in operation. From a very early age Pelly-Fry had a fascination with flight. He became involved in aeromodeling, and at the age of 17 became a member of the British Wakefield team. There were no model kit manufacturers at the time, and the aircraft were all hand built from scratch materials. He gained a reputation as a designer and flyer, and flew his own designs on Wimbledon Common.Group Captain James Pelly-Fry, The Daily Telegraph, 29 December 1994 He helped formulate the Wakefield Cup rules, and was a member of the British team from 1928 to 1932. During this time he worked through the week at the tea company, and spent his evenings either designing and building aircraft or writing about doing so in model aircraft magazines. The week-ends were often spent at Wakefield Commons. In 1933 Pelly-Fry accepted the invitation of American Gordon Light to fly his entry in the cup. Competing against six British entries, he finished tied for second. Pelly-Fry was very interested in becoming a pilot himself, but it was an expensive undertaking. Friends he had made in aeromodeling were able to encourage and direct him, and he applied for a position in the Royal Air Force. Though he did not initially succeed in getting into the RAF proper, in 1933 he was accepted for the Reserve of Air Force Officers. He spent a year at the de Havilland School of Flying in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, from June 1933 to October 1934. The curriculum covered flying, and the design, manufacture, and operation of aircraft. The instructors were engineers from the de Havilland aircraft company. The following year he signed on with an air charter firm at Heston Aerodrome to fly Fleet Street newspapers to Paris. In 1935 the Royal Air Force offered him a short-service commission. He was posted to the 216 transport squadron in Egypt, flying the Vickers Valentia. He spent the next three years flying in Africa, gaining valuable experience and flying hours. In October 1938 Pelly-Fry was selected as personal assistant to AOC Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Arthur Harris. Harris dubbed him “Pelly” and the nickname stuck. Second World War A Vickers Wellesley is prepared for a mission At the start of the Second World War Pelly-Fry was Flight Commander of 'A Flight' with the 223 Squadron, flying Vickers Wellesleys out of Nairobi in Kenya. When Italy entered the war in June 1940 his squadron was based at RAF Summit, an airfield along the rail line about 60 miles south west of Port Sudan. Their first combat mission on 11 June 1940 was a raid against Italian aircraft at the Gura airfield. Pelly-Fry led his flight of Wellesley bombers on a number of missions against Italian targets in Sudan and Italian East Africa during the East African Campaign. The flight was nicknamed \\"Pelly-Fry's Hell Divers\\". In August 1940, the squadron moved to Perim Island, near Aden to support operations in Italian Somaliland. Pelly-Fry was made commanding officer of 47 Squadron, also in the Wellesley wing and continued leading missions until he was transferred in January 1941. Pelly-Fry's recovered Bf 110, Belle of Berlin, in Egypt He was next posted as Joint Senior RAF Intelligence Officer Western Desert and, in the spring of 1941, was involved in the relief of RAF Habbaniya, under siege from the rebel force of the Iraqi potentate Raschid Ali. While there one of the pilots made a chance discovery of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter that had made a wheels-up forced landing in the Iraqi desert some 30 miles south-east of their airbase, and abandoned there. Pelly-Fry was immediately interested in recovering the long range fighter, to gain knowledge of the craft and with thoughts that he might be able to make personal use of the airplane. He flew out in a Tiger Moth to inspect the wreck. Just before opening the cockpit canopy he discovered the plane had been rigged with a booby-trap. He was able to disarm the device and inspect the aircraft, and soon set about recovering it. Pelly-Fry found the senior officers predictably unimaginative when they asked \\"What on earth do you want to recover a crashed German aeroplane for?\\" He was able to get a recovery team together, which drove out to the wreck with hoisting gear, elevated the aircraft, dropped down its landing gear and towed it back to the airbase. The ground crew at Habbaniya was able to repair the plane, but the work was not completed until after Pelly-Fry had been transferred off station. The aircraft was flown to Egypt for a time, and then sent to South Africa, where it had to make a second wheels up landing, ending the plane's useful life. In February 1941 he was transferred to the RAF's Headquarter Middle East in Cairo where he served for a year. Pelly-Fry served as Arthur Tedder's intelligence officer. Pelly had the idea of mounting two large maps on the walls of his office to keep track of the air activity of both RAF and that of the enemy. His staff updated changes frequently, and one could observe events as one would a tennis match. Tedder said he would come sit in Pelly's office, look up at the maps and consider: \\"Am I doing the right thing?\\", \\"What is the enemy up to?\\" and \\"What should I do next?\\" The Douglas Boston In January 1942 Pelly-Fry was transferred back to Britain. As a pilot of 31 years age and with a good deal of seniority, it was difficult for him to find duty in an operational squadron. He applied for night fighters, scoring 31 of 32 on the night vision entry test, but was not accepted due to his seniority. Finally he was assigned commanding officer of 88 Squadron, a light bomber formation undertaking daylight raids over occupied Europe as part of 2 Group. 2 Group was making daylight raids across the channel, and had the highest loss rate of Bomber Command groups. Pelly-Fry formed a crew and soon worked up to the lead position on operations. He led a series of circus missions over northern France, bombing targets while under heavy fighter escort, including the bombing of the Saint-Malo docks on 31 July 1942. 88 Squadron crews were billeted at Blickling Hall, a stately home north of Aylsham in Norfolk, where CO Pelly-Fry was soon nicknamed \\"Baron Fry of Blickling.\\" At the time of his arrival, 88 Squadron had just been equipped with the Douglas Boston medium bomber. This aircraft became a great favorite of Pelly-Fry. \\"One thing I was sure of, the Boston was just about the nicest, toughest, safest, fastest and most pleasing operational aeroplane that ever happened.\\" The circus operations they were flying were intended to prompt a response from the Luftwaffe in an effort to engage them and destroy them in combat. The bombing forces being covered were small, perhaps 12 aircraft, which were intended to have a high and low cover, three Spitfire squadrons in each. Rendezvous with the covering squadrons in the challenging weather over the English coast was difficult, but it was essential for the survival of the bombers. There was a certain tension that developed between the fighter squadrons and the bomber squadrons, who questioned if they were just asked along as bait. To address the situation Fighter Command requested a squadron commander from 2 Group be sent down to the Fighter Leaders School at RAF Charmy Down near Bath. Pelly-Fry was ordered to fly down to the course and give a talk to the fighter pilots training there on the workings of the bomber squadrons. Speaking with the pilots after his talk it soon became clear to all that what was needed was to simulate air operations, using a bomber force, a fighter escort and a strong force of intercepting mock-up German fighters. The idea was enthusiastically received by the fighter pilots, and the commands of Fighter and Bomber Headquarters gave the green light. A group of aggressor Spitfires were set apart by having their spinners and rudder fins painted red. Pelly's first foray was with a vic of three Bostons. The Fighter Leader School Tactics instructors followed within the formation or shadowed the formation from a distance to observe the exercise. The first go was a success. In subsequent visits Pelly would come down with his whole squadron. These training missions helped the groups function together better in the air, and the bomber pilots picked up a number of tricks from the Spitfire pilots on how to avoid gunfire during fighter attacks. The other major problem with working with the fighter escorts was linking up when the weather over England was often poor. This was made all the worse because for the daylight raids the bomber groups formed up and crossed the channel under the German radar, which meant they were down under 200 feet. The ability to find other aircraft flying at such a low height was very limited. Pelly solved this by advising Fighter Command that his Bostons would make the planned rendezvous on the correct heading and at the precise time, give or take 15 seconds. This required Pelly's navigator, Jock Cairns, to be on the mark every time, and he never missed a trick. Pelly soon developed a close working relationship with his fighter escorts. At the conclusion of a mission as they approached the English coast, he would often hear the click of the VHF followed by the Wing Commander offering him a farewell \\"Hi-de-hi!\\", followed by the rest of the Spitfire pilots, calling back in unison \\"Pelly- Fry!\\" On 16 August Pelly-Fry's squadron was secretly moved down from Attlebridge in Norfolk to RAF Ford in southern England. The move came three days before they were to be used to support a cross channel reconnaissance in force. Ford normally supported a night fighter squadron, which was moved for the mission. Speaking to the accommodations, Pelly remarked: \\"The airfield commander, Wing Commander Gerald Constable Maxwell, a kinsman of the Duke of Norfolk, was kindness itself and most efficiently made every provision for our stay. Upon arriving at the wartime officers' mess, or rather the sleeping quarters element, I was curious to know just why all the house bells were ringing incessantly. Upon tackling one of my young men about it, he said 'Have a look at the notice, sir.' The house was an erstwhile girls boarding school. And the notice read: 'If you need a Mistress, ring the bell.' Starting at daybreak, 19 August 1942, Pelly led his squadron in a series of sorties across the channel to Dieppe to suppress German batteries overlooking the beaches. The air battles engaged in to support the Dieppe raid were some of the most intense of the war. Though the RAF lost 91 aircraft, the Royal Air Force performed well and succeeded in their mission. =Operation Oyster= Bostons over the North Sea approaching Eindhoven Toward the end of November Pelly-Fry was called in to his commander's office. \\"There's to be a big show soon, Pelly\\" said Group Captain Denis Barnett. \\"It will need a lot of practice. It's to be a low level affair. The big problem will be getting a large group of aircraft to arrive at very precise times, and we shall be using different types of aircraft\\" This was Pelly's introduction to Operation Oyster, a major mission he would lead in daylight over the Netherlands. The mission was against the Philips works in Eindhoven, a large electronics manufacturing interest and research center. The Philips factories were thought to supply Germany with a third of the radio tubes used in its military radio communication equipment. The target was beyond the range of escort fighters. A high-level night attack by Bomber command had been ruled out, as it would result in a great many civilian casualties. As almost all of 2 Group was committed to the raid, three different types of bombers were involved. On 6 December 1942 Pelly-Fry led the eight squadrons tasked with destroying the Philips factories at Eindhoven. The Philips plant is hit during the Eindhoven raid As mission leader his aircraft was first to the target. The low level attack left no room for error. As he made his approach to the factory his aircraft suffered flak damage to the starboard wing and engine. The starboard wing dropped and he was flying at 90 degrees vertical from the ground, but he was able to pull it back. Regaining some control of his aircraft, he delivered his four 500 pound bombs on the Emmasingel vacuum tube works. He was so low during the attack that German anti-aircraft gunners on the roof were actually firing down at him. The damage to his starboard wing made it a struggle to get his aircraft to turn to port and home. He was forced to continue north and flew out through the dockside cranes of Rotterdam. Chased at the coast by a pair of Focke-Wulf 190s, he managed to evade their fire and made it back to England. Crossing over the channel, his port engine went in and out of trim. He struggled to keep the aircraft aloft. Reaching England, he asked if his crew would want to take to the chutes, but they all elected to stay with the aircraft. Pelly did a wheels up landing on a field, and everyone was able to get out alive. Inspecting the aircraft afterwards, he could see that the entire starboard aileron had been shot away. Nine Venturas, four Bostons and one Mosquito had been lost in the operation, but the Phillips factory had been effectively demolished. It was 6 months before it resumed production. Pelly- Fry was awarded the DSO for his role in Operation Oyster, the most famous and successful operation conducted by 2 Group. Wing Commander James Pelly-Fry (center) and fellow officers of 88 Squadron celebrate surviving the Eindhoven raid When Pelly-Fry visited the works while serving with the RAF after the war, he was apologetic to the Phillips directors for the destruction he had caused their plant. They were gracious hosts, and made him very welcome. \\"I am sorry for knocking your plant down\\" offered Pelly. \\"No hard feelings\\" Philips chairman Frans Otten replied, adding with a smile, \\"As you can see, we have a much better one now.\\" Near the completion of his tour in October 1943 Pelly- Fry was, to his astonishment, appointed Air Equerry to Britain’s King George VI. The position was as an aide to the King, and did not require Pelly to pilot the King's aircraft. He moved into Buckingham Palace and accompanied the royal family in their travels. Several months later he discreetly arranged to return to active service. Now with the rank of group captain, Pelly-Fry was assigned as station commander of the airfield at RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor in Yorkshire. The field supported Halifax bombers in the night bombing campaign over Germany. Prior to arriving he had to be checked out in the four engine bomber, and cleared to fly it day or night. Responsible for 3,500 station service personnel, the well being of the aircrews was his primary concern. The inevitable failure of aircraft to return and resultant loss of life of the aircrews he found deeply troubling. Though he was involved in the day to day running of the facility, when 76 Squadron was sent out on night operations every 3rd or 4th night he insisted on being present in the tower, both when the Halifaxes launched into the night, and again 4 hours later when they were due back. He remained station commander of this airfield until the end of the war. Life after the war In October 1945 Pelly-Fry was posted to Australia as Station Commander of RAF Camden in New South Wales. The station was part of the Transport Command, and was the main base for No. 300 Group RAF, which flew transport aircraft in support of the British Pacific Fleet. He held this post until February 1946. He then returned to civilian life and worked as a charter pilot in Kenya. The Gloster Meteor In 1947 he returned to the RAF, receiving a permanent commission as Squadron Leader 17 November 1947. He was posted to RAF Syerston as Wing Commander Administration. He was appointed to the RAF Personnel Selection Board, and staff appointments in NATO followed. Pelly-Fry attended the NATO Defence College in Paris from June to December, 1952. In January 1953 he was posted to the Plans, Policy & Operations Division of SHAPE, based in Paris. He remained there until January 1955. In April he was assigned Air Officer Commanding 12 TS, and oversaw their conversion to Meteor jets at RAF Weston Zoyland in Somerset. He was then promoted to group captain and appointed air attaché in Teheran. He held this post from July 1955 until he retired in September 1958. Pelly-Fry retired from the RAF in 1958. He had been noted for establishing an easy rapport with leading figures in NATO. His relationship with the Shah of Iran’s regime had proved of value in generating substantial export business for Britain's aviation industry. Upon retirement Pelly-Fry was immediately engaged by the Commonwealth Office as their Civil Air Adviser, British High Commissioners in Australia and New Zealand. He remained in this post, working out of Melbourne, until late 1962. He then joined the aircraft manufacturer Handley Page, where he worked from 1963 through 1966. After leaving Handley Page he went into the food business. He trained in Harrods’ Food Hall, and then opened a delicatessen of his own in Sussex. He called his deli Epicure of Chichester. He ran the business with his wife for a number of years before selling it and retiring to Somerset, where they lived near Naval Air Station HMS Heron. Pelly-Fry's proximity to a working airfield soon had him thinking of flight again, and he resumed his hobby of 50 years earlier, model aeroplanes. He first designed and built a 10 foot wingspan sailplane. As opposed to his creations from the late 1920s, his new model aircraft was radio-controlled and had working flaps and leading edge slots. Built by Pelly-Fry, it was flown by expert modelers comfortable with radio-control, and flew beautifully. Next Pelly fitted a small engine and demonstrated the craft's ability to stay aloft at extremely slow speeds. He then designed and constructed a miniature air speed indicator and fit it into the nose of the airplane. The unit confirmed that with flaps and leading edge slots deployed the aircraft could stay aloft at the airspeed of a brisk walk. With this technical success in hand, Pelly-Fry set about creating model aircraft that depicted those he had flown, starting with the plane he flew with 88 Squadron, a 1/10 scale Boston bomber with markings 111A RH-A and painted in the livery of the day. Next up he created a 1/10 scale version of Wellesley AO-A, flown by Pelly-Fry in 223 Squadron. His last completed project was of a 1/8 scale model of the de Haviland DH104 Devon he had flown as Air attaché in Tehran. In addition to building and flying model aircraft, he wrote articles for Model Aviation Magazine and Model Engineer. He served as a council member for the Society of Model Aeronautical Engineers. His insights were included in the first Model Aeroplane Manual. In the early 1990s Pelly- Fry wrote his autobiography, Heavenly Days: Recollections of a Contented Airman. It was published in 1994. The book recounts his life long fascination with flight, and the great good luck he had to be able to become a pilot and RAF officer. It recounts life in the RAF in the early 1930s, his many experiences flying all throughout Africa, the start of the Second World War, his time flying and commanding operational squadrons, and his impressions of many of the war's leaders whom he came to know during his time on staff headquarters. Notable figures Pelly writes of in his book include Marshals of the RAF Lords Charles Portal and Arthur Tedder, Air Chief Marshal Sir Basil Embry, Air Marshal Sir George Beamish, Air Vice Marshal Raymond Collishaw VC, Squadron Leader M T St John \\"Pat\\" Pattle, Field Marshal Lord Bernard Montgomery, General Sir William Platt, irregular warfare practitioner Orde Wingate, Major General David Lloyd Owen of the Long Range Desert Group and aviation editor C. G. Grey. For an aviation enthusiast, the entire experience was recalled as a great adventure that fell his way with a bit of opportunity, timing and good fortune. Personal life In 1949 at the age of 38 he married Irene Dunsford. The couple had a son. Pelly-Fry died 6 December 1994 while at a gathering for pilots and crews who participated in Operation Oyster. A representation of the many model aircraft Pelly-Fry built, including scale versions of the Boston, Wellesley and Devon airplanes, can be seen at the Goosedale Model Museum.

It entered into a limited Closed Alpha State on April 28, 2017. The game has launched into Steam's Early Access program on July 12, 2018.  Development  Development began in early 2015, with a Kickstarter launching not long afterwards. In December of the same year, an exclusive Closed Pre-Alpha phase of testing began to select backers of the Kickstarter. Closed Alpha officially began as of April 28, 2017 with subsequent phases of testing being rolled out to the public along with access keys. Islands of Nyne has released in Early Access state on July 12, 2018. In December 2018, the game's development was halted.  Features  * Islands of Nyne features a hand crafted Arena, known as Terra Fictus, described as \\"an amalgamation of stolen monuments and souvenirs hauled back from Earth by recruiters...the facade is quickly washed away by the looming support beams and modified terraformers holding it all together.\\" * A hand-crafted backstory, as blurbed by Rob Logan on the Islands of Nyne Kickerstarter Videohttps://ksr- video.imgix.net/projects/2219813/video-666569-h264_high.mp4 * Fast-paced arcade styled combat and movement. * A unique plasma convergence field that shrinks proportional to the number of players alive. * A functioning ranking system, ranking players based on score and rating for every game mode. * A cosmetic system, allowing for freedom of customisation of armour and weapon appearance. * A competitive experience, built from the ground up specifically for E-Sports .  Gameplay  = Pre-game and landing = Upon selecting your server and game-mode, you will be placed in a pre-game warm-up lobby. Players Familiar with Counter Strike's \\"Arms Race\\" game mode will be familiar with the model used here. Start with a pistol and eliminate two players to progress to the next weapon. Once the lobby is full or the game countdown forces the match to start, you will be given a countdown and will be thrown into the arena. Players will be put into a freefall, with control over their direction of travel. Looking up permits you to glide further and cover larger distances, whereas looking straight down to drop you right below where you are falling. No Parachutes necessary, you'll be thrown to the ground with a superhero-esque fist smash unscathed. = Movement = Movement in Islands of Nyne Is your standard affair for anyone who is used to any kind of First Person Shooter. Upon landing in the Dome, players will instinctively pick up the basics of movement Movement can be best described as \\"arcade\\". It's fast, responsive and isn't as heavily tied to realism as other Battle Royale games.. Upon moving around, players will quickly grasp the fluidity of the movement and aiming system in the game. There is no kind of acceleration or smoothing, all input is raw. This creates a smooth and responsive aiming axis and a lightning-fast movement platform. Jumping is another prominent feature, which unlike a lot of games include the ability to bunny-hop. This allows for quick rapid movements up in to the air while moving forward, making you a harder target to hit. It's worth nothing in Islands of Nyne your movement speed is not restricted or slowed down by jumping. You will always move at the base speed of the item you're carrying. = Combat = Combat, just like movement can be described as very \\"arcade\\". Combat is fast, fluid and relies very heavily on player skill, accuracy and cunning. Players will find a myriad of weapons, modifiers and armor around the playable area to assist you in combat. From providing health boosts, to damage reduction, as well as attachments to improve your aim and provide bonuses to your weapon's handling characteristics. . = Ballistics = Ballistics in Islands of Nyne are semi-realism focused. Every weapon has its own projectile speed, travel time, bullet drop, and spread. Players should take into account the range to a target, and the elevation to and from their target to provide as accurate a shot as possible to increase your chance of hitting a target and dealing damage. Every weapon in Islands of Nyne has its own unique spray-pattern that is fully learn-able. Players can use the integrated Training room to brush up on their aiming and familiarise themselves with the weapons on offer.  Game modes  * Free for all: Classic solo battle royale against up to 49 other players. Last contestant standing wins. * Doubles: Up to 25 Pairs of 2 fight until the last team is standing. * Squads: Currently Squads is under testing, but Trios, 4's and 5's have all been tested. No official mode has been chosen. * Gun Game: The gun game is played during the pre-game lobby. Players start with the M9A1 pistol. Every 2 kills upgrades/changes the player's current gun. There is currently no punishment to de-grade your weapon (Commonly knife kills in other games). * Training Room: A virtual shooting range that will allow you to touch up on your handling with all weapons currently available in the game. Includes target dummies ranging from 25m-500m, a challenge mode, toggle-able light switches and a recoil pattern wall to learn and adjust to the unique spray- patterns of any weapon in the game.

It was discovered on 1 September 1984, by Italian astronomer Maria Barucci at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The presumed E-type asteroid has a longer-than average rotation period of 37.4 hours and possibly an elongated shape.  Orbit and classification  is a bright core member of the Hungaria family (), a large family of three thousand asteroids located within the dynamical group with the same name. Hungarias form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System; they are inside the asteroid belt's core region, sometimes considered a completely independent population. The asteroid orbits the Sun in the innermost asteroid belt at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days; semi-major axis of 1.93 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery found in the Digitized Sky Survey and taken at the Siding Spring Observatory in November 1977, almost 7 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar.  Physical characteristics  is an assumed E-type asteroid, known for their high albedos, typically around 0.4. = Rotation period = In July 2013, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a long rotation period of 37.44 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.66 magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape (). While not being a slow rotator, has a significantly longer period than most asteroids, which rotate once every 2 to 20 hours around their axis. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, this asteroid measures 1.728 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.78. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between the E- (0.40) and S-type (0.20) members of the Hungaria family and group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 2.43 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.0.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 26 July 2000 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

She was the daughter of nobleman Stanisław Wessel, Rogala coat of arms and Countess Maria Barbara von Starhemberg (1673-1745). Maria Barbara had been the royal governess of Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska (1676–1730), one of the daughters of John III Sobieski. After becoming a widow early, her mother married in 1692 Count Franz Karl von Dünewald auf Pixendorf who died just a year later in 1693 and she married again Count Maximilian Siegmund Friedrich von Trauttmansdorff (1674-1731). Most likely, from 1702 Maria Józefa was in Oława at the court of her future husband's brother, James Louis Sobieski.Sikorski, p. 195 On 18 November 1708, in Gdańsk, she married Konstanty Władysław Sobieski, one of the sons of John III. This marriage was not well received, especially by Konstanty's mother, the dowager Queen Marie Kazimiera.Skrzypietz, p. 298 Soon after the marriage, Konstanty Władysław left Poland, leaving his wife behind, and in 1711 he took the first steps towards obtaining a divorce.Skrzypietz, pp. 298–299, 302 At first, Maria Józefa did not refuse to go along with this, but she wanted to agree on favorable terms. Until May 1719, Maria Józefa lived at the Convent of the Holy Sacraments in Warsaw, intending to remain there for the duration of the divorce proceedings. In 1720, Konstanty bought her a town house in Warsaw from the courtier Franciszek Manteuffel-Kiełpiński.Sikorski, p. 197 In 1724 the ongoing divorce proceedings finally confirmed that the marriage had been lawful,Skrzypietz, p. 308 and in November 1725 the terms of a settlement were agreed. It has been claimed that at the end of that year, Maria Józefa gave birth to a stillborn son, but this is considered unlikely.Skrzypietz, p. 310; Sikorski, p. 197 On 22 July 1726 Konstanty Władysław died, and Maria Józefa became his widow. In the spring of 1727, Maria Józefa entered into a contract with her brother-in-law James Louis Sobieski under which, for the next year and a half, she was to manage the Prince Konstanty's estates in Żółkiew, now Zhovkva in the Ukraine, Pomorzany, and Tarnopol. In January 1729, Maria Józefa left Zhovkva to live in Lwów, also now in the Ukraine, and from there she moved on to Pilica, Upper Silesia, where she bought a castle and thirteen neighboring villages. Between 1731 and 1740, she rebuilt the castle to serve as her main residence. She also founded a Franciscan monastery in Pilica, the Minor Friars of Strict Observance.Sikorski, pp. 197-198 In 1753, Maria Józefa sold her estates to a nephew, Teodor Wessel, and returned to living in the Convent of the Holy Sacraments at Warsaw. On 4 January 1761, she died there of breast cancer, leaving her remaining property to nephews and nieces. Her funeral was on 7 January 1761 at the church of Saint Casimir in the New Town, where her tomb could still be visited until the destruction caused during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.Sikorski, pp. 198–199 Notes References * Skrzypietz, Rozkwit i upadek rodu Sobieskich (Warsaw, 2014) * Sikorski A., Maria-Józefa z Wesslów żona królewicza Konstantego Sobieskiego, [w:] Rocznik Polskiego Towarzystwa Heraldycznego t.
