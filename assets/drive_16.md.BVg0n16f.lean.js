Ravel began the composition in December 1914 in response to the outbreak of World War I, in which he hoped to be enlisted to fight for France. While he waited for months, he wrote text and music of the three songs in the tradition of 16th-century French chansons. He completed the work in 1915, and it was published by √âditions Durand in 1916. The songs were premiered in 1917, performed by a choral ensemble conducted by Louis Aubert. They remained his only composition for a cappella choir.  History  Ravel composed the Trois Chansons in response to World War I, beginning the work in December 1914, when he was in Paris waiting to be drafted. He was determined to fight for his country. In November, he took daily driving lessons, aiming to join a supply department, and passed the test in December. He then began to write the first of three songs, which was published as the central one, adding the other two by February 1915. He wrote in a letter to a friend, Cyprian Godebski: Ravel reacted to the war with texts and music reminiscent of traditional French chansons of the 16th century. He wrote the texts himself in the spirit of popular rhymes. He dedicated the three songs to three people who might help him with the enlisting, \\"Nicolette\\" to Tristan Klingsor, who was connected to the military, \\"Trois beaux oiseaux du Paradis\\" to Paul Painlev√©, a mathematician and socialist politician who was to become minister of war in 1917, and \\"Ronde\\" to Sophie Clemenceau, n√©e Szepz, the wife of Paul Clemenceau. It took eight months until Ravel was enlisted in March 1915, with help from Painlev√©. The Chansons were published by √âditions Durand in 1916, and were premiered on 11 October 1917, performed by a choral ensemble assembled by Jane Bathori, conducted by Louis Aubert, at Th√©√¢tre du Vieux- Colombier. The work is catalogued as No. 69 in the list of compositions by Maurice Ravel established by musicologist Marcel Marnat. The Chansons are Ravel's only composition for a cappella choir. Ravel made an arrangement, M 69a, for medium voice and piano.  Texts and music  A common theme in all three songs is loss, handled not without humour and irony. In \\"Nicolette\\", a young girl picking flowers on a meadow escapes a wolf and a page, but loses her innocence to an older gentleman offering silver. In \\"Trois beaux oiseaux du Paradis\\" (Three beautiful birds of Paradise), a girl whose beloved is in the war understands from the gifts of blue, white and red birds (the national colours of France) that he died. In \\"Ronde\\", young people lose respect for the warnings of the older men and women. The texts recall the atmosphere of Renaissance music, and are supported by equally archaic music with plagal cadences and ancient turns of phrasing, with the music closely following the words. The music alludes to Renaissance chanson and madrigal. = Nicolette = The first song is set in A minor. The theme is followed by three variations ‚Äì that of the wolf, that of the page, graceful and aerial, and that of the rich Barbon. In the three verses, the motif is presented alternately by all voices, the tempo varying from one verse to another, both bouncing and fearful. By combining the same melody with different accompaniment, Ravel achieves a form which is both strophic and theme with variations. = Trois beaux oiseaux du Paradis = The second song (Three beautiful birds of Paradise) is set in F minor. The song is the only one of the three clearly referring to the war, the colours of the birds being the colours of the flag of France, and the refrain \\"Mon ami, z'il est √° la guerre\\". The first verses are presented by the \\"heavenly\\" voice of the soprano, continued by the tenor. The song was described as \\"of the three pieces, the most refined, undoubtedly\\" and as an \\"exquisite ballad full of tenderness\\". Ravel gave it a form of a free rondo, in a form described as ABABA.A, while the traditional form might be ABACA, deviating from it by no contrasting C section but a repeat of A as a coda. The theme of longing is expressed by a languid melody with sparse accompaniment, in modal harmonies. = Ronde = The third song is in A major, with a Lydian D-sharp. The text is full of word-play in the tradition of 16th- century chansons, and has been described as \\"a virtuosic display of tongue- twisting verbal dexterity\\", and compared to that of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods. \\"In his display of erudite demonic science, Ravel has mixed all traditions: ancient, medieval and even oriental\\" and the polyphony is becoming more and more virtuosic. This song shows features of Basque folk music. The form is strictly strophic, with three contrasting sections in each stanza.  Reception and legacy  The chansons were reviewed immediately and favourably. Later, Henri Collet wrote, \\"on these three dissimilar songs, Maurice Ravel composed an adorable musical triptych in which he shows himself the progressive continuator of Janequin and Costeley. \\"Nicolette\\" is the first time \\"allegro moderato\\"; the \\"Three beautiful birds of Paradise\\" constitute the moving andante, and the Ronde forms a dazzling finale of verve.\\" At the composer's death, the work was counted among those of maturity, revealing \\"an art that was more and more master of its means\\".

He has a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Literary Theory from the University of Pennsylvania and was selected as the fourth Poet Laureate of Philadelphia in 2018. He currently lives in Puerto Rico. Education and early life Raquel Salas Rivera was born in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico and moved to Madison, Wisconsin when he was 6 months old. During his childhood years, he lived in California, Nebraska, Alabama, and Texas. He returned to Puerto Rico during his teenage years and young adulthood, moving to Philadelphia for graduate studies. His grandfather, Sotero Rivera Avil√©s, was a Puerto Rican poet belonging to the Guajana Generation, as is his mother, linguist Yolanda Rivera Castillo. The poet attended the Universidad de Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez for his undergraduate degree, and had an instrumental role in organizing student protests at that campus in 2010. Career and writing Salas Rivera's writing emphasizes movement and often deals with themes of migration. In speaking about his heritage, the author acknowledges that migrating people have multiple homes and allegiances, and states that \\"My home is Philadelphia, and my home is Puerto Rico.‚Äù He prefers to write in Spanish, and later sometimes translates his works to English. For public readings, he often recites works only in Spanish. According to the poet, \\"It's a political act\\" to have an audience of non-Spanish speakers listen to a language they don't understand, because the momentary discomfort echoes the everyday struggles of immigrants who don't yet understand the language of their new country. In his writing, he often leaves some words untranslated, which he refers to as \\"knots\\" that \\"resist assimilation and loss\\" because language and experience can be so tightly bound as to defy separation. His work lo terciario/the tertiary focuses on the Puerto Rican debt crisis and the economic and social impact of the 2016 United States congressional measure called the PROMESA Law that transferred control of the island's finances and outstanding debt to an external control board. Salas Rivera titled each book section after Marxist economic ideas from Das Kapital: ‚ÄúThe Debt-Production Process,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Debt- Circulation Process,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNotes on a Derailed Circulation\\", beginning each poem with a quote by Karl Marx, as both a critique and a subversion of Marxist language. The poet identifies as non-binary gender and refers to himself with the pronoun \\"he\\". He has adopted the Spanish word \\"buchipluma\\", in as a neologism for a \\"non-binary feathered butch\\" to describe his gender identity. One of his inspirations is the Puerto Rican Latin trap singer Bad Bunny. To Salas Rivera, poetry has given him \\"an inside\\", \\"an outside\\", and \\"a means for talking about things\\", referencing gender identity. Acknowledging a historical lack of transgender persons' voices in literature, Salas Rivera has attempted to \\"navigate\\" this gap by speaking from a transgender perspective. Through his writing and civic activism, he seeks to \\"engage people throughout Philadelphia neighborhoods\\" and \\"make a Philadelphia that is safe for difference\\". During his tenure as Poet Laureate of Philadelphia, Salas Rivera created a multilingual poetry festival called \\"We (Too) Are Philly\\" inspired by the work \\"I, Too\\" by the African-American poet Langston Hughes. The summer 2018 festival, co-organized with poets Ashley Davis, Kirwyn Sutherland, and Raena Shirali, featured Philadelphia-based poets of color. The goal of the organizers was to diversify the poetry scene to encourage the mixing or desegregation of audiences, while selecting locations of significance to particular Philadelphia neighborhoods that usually do not host poetry readings. Personal life Salas Rivera lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2017, Salas Rivera and Allison Harris raised thousands of dollars to assist lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Puerto Ricans who were impacted by Hurricane Maria that year. Through his efforts, he was able to bring 5 queer/transgender persons to the United States and support them, with assistance from the Mazzoni Center. That same year, Salas Rivera, alongside Ricardo Alberto Maldonado, Erica Mena, and Carina del Valle Schorske, published Puerto Rico en mi coraz√≥n, a series of bilingual broadside of contemporary Puerto Rican poets. All profits from the sale of the broadsides were donated to the grassroots organization Taller Salud, in order to aid with recovery after the devastation caused by the impact of hurricanes Irma and Mar√≠a.

Salas Rivera was a 2018 fellow of the CantoMundo Poetry Workshop to develop Latinx poets and poetry. Salas Rivera was chosen as the fourth poet laureate of Philadelphia in 2018, under the auspices of the Free Library of Philadelphia. According to the selection committee, the poet was chosen because of his desire to use poetry to engage the subject of diversity in Philadelphia and its Puerto Rican community. He received the 2018 Ambroggio Prize from the Academy of American Poets, honoring poets whose first language is Spanish, for his manuscript x/ex/exis (poemas para la naci√≥n). His work lo terciario/the tertiary was longlisted for the National Book Award for Poetry in 2018 and won the 2018 Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Poetry. In 2019, he won the Laureate Fellowship from the Academy of American Poets. His work while they sleep (under the bed is another country) was longlisted for the 2020 Pen America Open Book Award.

The group of twenty-two members conducted multiple studies and published over 400 recommendations which influenced reform and were discussed in the news media including The New York Times. Background and mandate Crime rates for the most common types of street crime such as murder, robbery, assaults, forcible rape and burglary increased dramatically during the 1960s.National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, A National Strategy to Reduce Crime, Washington D.C., GPO, 1973, 12-13. The rising crime rates caught the attention of federal legislators. The United States Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (\\"Act\\") to address the problem. In the Act itself, Congress expressly noted that crime was essentially a state and local concern, but it found that the problem of increasing crime required federal aid to strengthen state and local criminal police, courts and correction agencies. Title I of the Act created Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (\\"LEAA\\") in the United States Department of Justice to administer monies to states and localities through federal grants.P.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197 (1968) President Richard Nixon's Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, determined that state criminal justice agencies would benefit from advisory standards and goals based on actual experience in the various states. He directed LEAA to provide the financial support and the initiative for the effort. LEAA responded by creating and funding in 1973 the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals made up of state and local political leaders and criminal justice professionals.National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, A National Strategy to Reduce Crime, Washington D.C., GPO, 1973, 169-176. The Commission's mandate was to create goals and standards for state and local governments to reduce crime and improve criminal justice.Ibid. 175-176. Commission members The Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (\\"LEAA'), Jerris Leonard, appointed the Republican governor of Delaware, Russell W. Peterson to serve as Chairman of the Commission and Los Angeles County Sheriff, Peter J. Pitchess, to serve as Vice Chairman. The Executive Director of the Commission's staff was Thomas J. Madden and its Deputy Director was Lawrence J. Leigh. Although LEAA selected the members of the Commission and its twelve specialized task forces, it did not direct the Commission's work or its product.Ibid. 169-176. The twenty-two Commission members included law enforcement, judicial, community and political leaders from various levels of state and local government. Membership included police chiefs, judges, prosecutors, corrections leaders, and private attorneys. Among the members of the Commission who later had long political careers in the United States Senate were Arlen Spector, District Attorney of Philadelphia and Richard G. Lugar, Mayor of Indianapolis.Ibid.National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, A National Strategy to Reduce Crime, Washington D.C.: GPO, 1973. Work and reports In 1973, the Commission finished its work and issued a summary volume, A National Strategy to Reduce Crime,Ibid. 153-168. which presented a broad picture of the Commission's work and summarized its approximately 400 standards and recommendations. For example, they included standards for criminal justice information systems, recruitment of minorities, community policing, speedy trial processing and treatment and rehabilitation of offenders.Ibid. 154-156; 159-168 The Commission also recognized the importance of community organizations and programs outside the formal criminal system by issuing standards and recommendations for areas as diverse as community drug abuse treatment centers and the physical design of public places such as parks and buildings.Ibid. 157-158 The Commission presented the full text of each standard and recommendation with commentary in five separate volumes defined by subject matter entitled Criminal Justice System,National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report on the Criminal Justice System, Washington D.C.: GPO, 1973.

GPO, 1973. Commission and the news media As noted in a commercially published edition of the Commission's work in 1975, certain specific standards and recommendations caught the attention of the news media such as a proposed ban on plea bargaining. One newsworthy recommendation was that each state should outlaw the private possession of handguns by 1983. As noted above, another recommendation was the abolition of plea bargaining: the negotiation of prosecutorial charging and sentencing recommendations in return for guilty pleas. Still another groundbreaking recommendation was that most offenders receive a maximum sentence of no more than five years except for career offenders.The Commission's call for privacy and security standards for criminal justice information systems such as criminal records and police intelligence files also received notice. Effect on structural reforms The full impact of the Commission's approximately 400 standards and recommendations is beyond the scope of this article. However, there is evidence that the Commission's work did have an impact on professional development and structural reform of the police, courts, prosecutorial and public defender agencies in certain states. These included unification of correctional systems under statewide agencies and state-administered and financed judicial, prosecutorial and defender systems as well as the consolidation of smaller police departments into larger agencies. The Commission's report also inspired and spurred the adoption of a federal regulation governing criminal justice information systems.28 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 20.3-20.38. The Commission's proposal to ban plea bargaining was adopted in the state of Alaska, but not in major cities. Finally, the Commission's Report also contributed to and shaped judicial opinions towards constitutional and legislative standards in Supreme Court and lower court decisions.\\"E.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 114 n.8 (1979) (prisoner's rights); \\"Detroit Police Officer's Association v. Young,\\" 608 F.2d 671, 671, 695 (6th Cir. 1979), (police minority recruitment); \\"Scott v.

The band consists of Reid Bateh (vocals, guitar), Blaze Bateh (drums, vocals), and William Brookshire (bass, vocals). Their use of machines, loops and other assorted lo-fi software aided in them also being labeled as noise rock. The band released their album Dreamviolence in April 2013 and later Swarm in 2016, which saw a turn for the band as they began to strip away their noisy elements in return for more traditional songwriting. In 2018, the band released the album Shadow on Everything to positive critical reception. In 2020, the band released the album Stray, which received critical acclaim.  History  The band chose the name Bambara as a reference to the character of the same name from the animated television series √Üon Flux. They moved from Athens Georgia to Brooklyn, where they would sign with Arrowhawk Records in 2013. Bambara recorded their album Dreamviolence from their basement apartment before releasing it in April of that same year. Their music was labeled as noise-rock in part due to their use of machines, loops, and other assorted lo-fi software. By mid-2014, the band nearly finished their full-length LP Swarm, but had their computer stolen with all of the tracks they had recorded up until that point. This resulted in a delay for the album as the band took a break before re-recording the stolen tracks. Bambara recorded and released an experimental EP of pure noise titled Night Chimes in August 2015. The band stated that the EP helped get the noise \\"out of their systems\\" which helped in creating a more toned down version of the abrasive sounds of Swarm when the time came to re-record it. The album was released on April 1, 2016. According to Zo√´ Beery of The Village Voice, Swarm showcased the band's trademark atmosphere through long reverb and distorted guitars, but with clearer production to showcase the musicality as well as Reid Bateh's vocals. Their follow up to Swarm, entitled Shadow on Everything and released through Wharf Cat Records, continued this style for the band by restraining the noise experimentation while also incorporating a Western Gothic concept. The album follows a loose story of characters reciting eerie tales to each other at a dive bar. Critical reception for the album was positive. Following the release of Shadow on Everything in April 2018, the band embarked on a European tour in support for the album before going on an American tour in support of IDLES. Their time on the road continued into 2019 as they announced an East Coast tour in support of Daughters.  Musical style and influences  Their style has been described as noise rock and post-punk. Noisey's Colin Joyce described the songs as \\"chaotic\\" and \\"being held together with formless washes of noise and anxious vocal drones.\\" Marcos Hassan from Tinymixtapes listed the severity of Swans and the \\"depraved cabaret mold\\" of The Birthday Party as the sound they've been honing together. Reid Bateh has mentioned the films of Wong Kar Wai and David Lynch and the moods portrayed in them as influences on their sound. Bateh also cited the Southern Gothic themes from the writings of Flannery O'Connor and Bruno Schulz as influences on the themes in Swarm.

In 1967, Richmond Bishop John J. Russell established the mission as a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington in Virginia. History Before the Civil War, slaves from around Northern Virginia worshipped at Basilica of St. Mary in Alexandria, Virginia, with slave owners. During the Civil War, Alexandria's population swelled with contrabands (escaped slaves), who also worshipped at St. Mary. However, after the Civil War, Jim Crow laws restricted the rights of black Americans. Black Catholics were forced to worship from the back of the church, then told not to sit with the main congregation. They sat in the north wing, had their own religious education classes, and were married by priests in their homes., Vernon Miles, Connection Newspapers, Alexandria: St. Joseph Catholic Church Celebrates Its 100th Anniversary, November 19, 2015. By the turn of the 20th century, black Catholics were served by their own priest, Rev. Charles Hannigan of the Josephites whose mission was to serve the needs of Native and African American communities. He traveled from Richmond each week to conduct Mass for the worshiping black Catholics., Alexandria Times, Establishing St. Joseph Church, June 10, 2010. By 1913, black Catholics wanted their own church. Thomas Blair, a black man and sexton of Basilica of St. Mary for over thirty years, convened a committee to explore the possibility of establishing a church. Working with Fr. Hannigan, Mr. Blair held meetings at the Basilica's lyceum with his fellow and drafted a letter to the Bishop Denis J. O‚ÄôConnell of Richmond asking to form themselves into a new congregation., Terry Necciai and Arianna Drumond (July 2007). \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Uptown‚ÄìParker‚ÄìGray Historic District\\" (PDF). The appeal was approved and, despite the fact that African Americans were among the poorest of residents of Alexandria, Mr. Blair held a variety of fund- raising activities and raised the funds to purchase the property.Ochs, Stephen J., Desegregating the Altar: The Josephites and the Struggle for Black Priests, 1871-1960, LSU Press, 1993. In 1914, the committee acquired property at the historically black neighborhood called Uptown, at the northwest corner of Wythe and North Columbus streets. While Mr. Blair and the community raised additional funds for building the church, Hannigan convinced Katherine Drexel, founder of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and member of a wealthy Philadelphia family, to donate $8,000 towards the building of St. Joseph Catholic Church. That was half of the expected cost of the church; the remaining amount was to be raised by the parishioners., Josephite Parish in Arlington Turns 100, The Harvest, Volume 127, Number 3, Summer 2015. In 1915, Rev. Joseph J. Kelly, another Josephite, was assigned to the new congregation. St. Joseph Catholic Church was dedicated on May 14, 1916. Two weeks later, Mr. Blair, considered the father of St. Joseph Church, died at the age of 65. Washington architects Murphy and Olmsted designed the red-brick, English Gothic-style church. In 1915, Rev, Joseph J. Kelly served as the first pastor, who lived in the altar boys‚Äô sacristy unit the completion of the rectory in 1921. He served at St. Joseph's until 1936. The parish grew large enough within a few years to build its own school. Although a school began operating within the church building in 1916 to serve the local African American community, a new school was built in 1931 and staffed by the Oblate Sisters of Providence, an order of African American sisters. They taught at the school until 1969 when the school closed. In 1967, Richmond Bishop John J. Russell re-designated St. Joseph's from an African American mission church to a territorial parish within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington in Virginia. St. Joseph's is still associated with the Josephite Fathers to this day.

Crimes Between 2010 and 2011, with the help of Alcibiades M√©ndez, Ceballos abducted and murdered five teenagers in La Chorrera: Yessenia Argelis Loo Kam, Yong Jian Wu, Samy Zeng Chen, Joel Maurio Liu Wong and Georgina del Carmen Lee Chen. The murders shocked the city, and the authorities were mobilized. Eventually, the bodies of the deceased were found buried under a residence in the El Trapichito sector of the city. Soon after, Ceballos was detained in the Dominican Republic and extradited to Panama in 2011, where he was put on pre-trial detention. However, on December 28, 2016, with the aid of several accomplices, he managed to escape from the La Joyita Prison, outside of the capital. He hid for around a year, before eventually being captured by authorities in Jac√≥, Costa Rica on September 22, 2017. When he was seized, he was using false documents, presenting himself as a Colombian national named Carlos Alberto Aguirre Valencia. Ceballos was arrived in the capital through Albrook Airport, with shackles on his hands and feet, and was quickly put in a maximum security prison cell. On September 29, 2017, he was charged with escaping from prison and conspiracy to commit a crime. His trial was first supposed to have started on October 26, but a Panamanian court postponed it until November 23. Ceballos' lawyer, Rogelio Cruz, filed a habeas corpus motion to the Judicial Branch of Panama, arguing that the pre-trial detention that his client had received was unlawful, also adding that he was vilified by the media. This move was criticized by Cristobal Fu, the legal representative of the victims' family members, who noted that the motion was probably filed in order to stall the proceedings. The defense team filed a 3-month period postponement request to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which was denied due to its complexity. Cruz claimed that he needed time to analyze the 500-page file, as he had not been able to properly access it. However, the trial proceeded either way. Prior to Ceballos' arrival in court, the relatives of the victims presented their complaints concerning the defense's constant delayings of the procedure. When the defendant arrive, he tried to assume his own defense, a move denied by the court. Ceballos subsequently plead not guilty to the murder charges. On November 29, a second hearing concerning the complex case was cancelled, as one of the defense lawyers representing one of the other accused parties was missing. On December 4, the Deputy Prosecutor of Organized Crime Miguel Tu√±√≥n requested an extension of 4 months to further investigate all suspects involved in the case due to its sheer size. The Magistrate Judge, Francisco Carpintero, agreed to the proposal. After being found guilty of all charges on June 22, 2018, Ceballos and his accomplice M√©ndez were both sentenced to 50 years imprisonment for murdering the youths. The same sentence was also given to Keyla Gisselle Bendib√∫ Salazar and Mario Luis Vega, who had acted as secondary accomplices in three of the murders. A sentence of 15 years was given to Kenny Alezander Bendib√∫ Salazar and Roberto Antonio Mariscal for being accomplices in homicide, but were acquitted of kidnapping charges. Coupled with all this, all of them would be disqualified from public functions for a term of 10 years once they serve out their sentences. After two years of being incarcerated, he escaped from prison on February 2, 2020.

The neighborhood consists of preserved, architect-designed Revival style buildings built in the early 20th century with amenities such as original brick streets and locally produced street lighting standards. The District features homes designed by several distinguished architects, including Charles Firestone, Herman Albrecht, and Louis Hoicowitz. Due to its historic architectural significance, the District was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1982.  Description  The Ridgewood Historic District is an area of residential buildings extending east and west of Market Avenue North, a major north-south artery, in the City of Canton approximately 20 blocks from the center of town. A series of three contiguous allotments, the District was developed by George A. (Jake) Leonard and the Leonard Agency between 1918 and 1940, with the majority of its significant buildings having been erected in the decade 1920 to 1930. The name of Ridgewood is attributed to Mrs. Leonard, who was quite taken with an allotment which she had visited in Springfield, Ohio, called \\"Ridgewood.\\" Of the 190 buildings in the District, 58 Post World War II buildings provide background. There are no intrusions. Most of the homes were built between 1919 and the depression. The model for the allotment was a design by John Sherwood (Fritz) Kelly, built in 1919 at 234 19th Street NW. The earliest of the Tudor Revival style homes, built in the same year at 145 19th Street NW, was designed by Herman Albrecht. Over the next decade Albrecht designed more than a dozen homes in the District, as did Charles E. Firestone. J. Kelly, working with his brother-in-law Arthur Brothers, was responsible for nearly two dozen houses in the District. The District is typical of other such residential areas in that its homes are relatively large, set back from the street and enhanced by mature overhanging trees and lush plantings. While most of its streets are laid out in a grid pattern, University Avenue and 22nd Street NW, and the west portion of 22nd and 24th Streets NE are curved to provide variation in lot shape and vista, and to discourage the use of the streets as thoroughfares. No unsympathetic commercial strips, and no gas stations or parking lots mark the District. While the buildings were built at more or less the same time, the District exhibits none of the sameness and homogeneity found in post-World War II residential developments. Its buildings are architect-designed for the most part and demonstrate the enormous variations of shape, skin, and sensibility that characterize the European Revival styles favored by a number of architects working in this period. Nor is there skimping in the use of materials and craftsmanship. Windows of beveled and leaded glass, multifaceted roof lines featuring slate in various shapes and hues, hand-cut stone, tapestry brick, gazebos, battlements, and turrets abound, as do variations in cornice treatments featuring the modillions, dentils, and corbelling of the original styles from which these dwellings take their themes. The District's ambiance recalls the quality and substance deemed appropriate in their homes by pre-Depression gentry. The following are typical examples of buildings found throughout the District: Tudor Revivals * Mitchell House (Albrect, Wilhelm, and Kelly, 1921) * Ball House (J. Kerr Griffen, 1929) * Giessen House (Charles Firestone, 1928) All three buildings feature, in various executions, pargetting, leaded and multi-lighted casements, voussoirs, Tudor-arched entries, coursed stone first stories and half-timbered second stories, and potted chimneys in massed arrangements. French Norman Revivals * Harris House (John S. Kelly, 1930) * Fischgrund House (Louis Hoicowitz, 1927) *Obermeier House (Louis Hoicowitz, 1930) Both feature wall dormers and window bays, plastered entries, hipped roofs (suggestive, if not directly imitative of the mansard), and multiple roof levels. Georgian Revivals * Lavin House (Kelly, 1930) * Blake House (Albrect and Wilhelm, 1930) Both feature pedimented entries with fan lights, dentilled cornices, shuttered, double-hung sash windows, brick skins, and other elements appropriate to this type. Tudor Revival Home in Ridgewood, Canton Ohio, blt. 1929 In addition to the revival styles of the majority of Ridgewood buildings, several buildings exhibit the transitional features characteristic of the spreading suburban architecture being built in other cities. One such effort, the Fawcett House (John S. Kelly and Arthur Brothers, 1921), was built as a spec house to entice investment in the new allotment. Its rolled roof, suggesting thatch, and its rows of paned casements give its eclecticism a \\"modern\\" feeling belying the revival remnants of its Doric-columned entry, arched window moldings suggesting Palladians, and its fan-lighted gable. Another atypical building for the District is the Lehman/Belden House, the earliest house in the area (1890), a substantial vernacular building with Queen Anne and Eastlake elements. In spite of variations such as these, however, the District has the unified, slightly Europeanized flavor characteristic of other developments of its period, and represents the best in elegant American suburban architecture.  Significance  alt= The Ridgewood Historic District is significant in that it is the only residential development in the City of Canton built in this period and featuring the architect-designed Revival style buildings popular in the early 20th century. It is significant, too, in that, through its visual amenities ‚Äì its locally produced lighting standards and paving materials, and in the fact that many of its buildings were designed by local architectural talent ‚Äì the District highlights home-produced features of Canton's development and preserves them for the future. The Ridgewood allotment was platted in several stages between 1918 and 1927 and developed by the Leonard Agency, a subsidiary of which, the Canton Home Site Company, was established to manage the development. The largest portion to the west of Market was once farm land held until 1918 by members of the Martin family, though the parcel had been annexed to the city in 1905-6. The east portion, originally called the Bellwood addition and farmed by residents of the Stark County Poor House, was annexed to the city in 1911. Except for 25th Street NW, which was paved in 1924 by the city, the remaining streets were paved by private contractors with brick manufactured by Canton's own Metropolitan Paving Brick Company, the largest producer of paving brick in the country. Metropolitan pavers were used in New York's major tunnels and on the Indianapolis speedway. Ridgewood's street lights were manufactured by another Canton firm, Union Metal Manufacturing Company, who built ornamental street lighting standards for first class suburban developments and other uses nation-wide. Ridgewood Entrance, 21st St. NW = Architecture = Several local architects were responsible for the Revival styles which characterize the District. * Charles E. Firestone, known as Canton's leading architect from 1915 to 1959 and responsible for Timken High School, Fawcett Stadium, the Canton Memorial Civic Center, Molly Stark Hospital, and numerous churches, designed twelve buildings in Ridgewood, three of them for himself. * Herman Albrect, practicing out of Massillon until 1925 as Albrect, Wilhelm, and Kelly and out of Cleveland and Massillon thereafter as Albrect and Wilhelm, designed 14 buildings in Ridgewood in addition to portions of the Aultman Hospital, the Massillon Museum and Library, and some 36 other Canton residences. * John Sherwood Kelly, in business for himself after leaving Albrect and Wilhelm in 1925, also did numbers of buildings in northeast Ohio. Teamed with his brother-in-law, contractor Arthur M, Brothers, he designed 18 Ridgewood buildings. *Louis Hoicowitz, a Russian immigrant who made good in home construction and another of Ridgewood's prolific local builders, designed 13 of what were considered to be the most impressive buildings in the District by virtue of his propensity for turrets. Ridgewood is a coherent architectural statement announcing Canton's industrial coming- of-age. Its establishment accompanied the event; its buildings embellished it. The architectural significance of the Ridgewood Historic District lies in its initial building period from 1920‚Äì1930. It was during this period that Ridgewood's identity, conveyed through its architecture and landscaping, was established. The tree-lined brick-paved streets display Colonial and Tudor Revival Styles as the prevailing architectural choice of Ridgewood homeowners. The architectural continuity can be traced throughout Ridgewood's development from 1920 to 1940 and to a lesser extent in the more recent construction of the last decades. Residences built from 1930‚Äì1940 closely reproduce the variety of materials and surface quality displayed in the earlier Colonial and Tudor Revival style houses dating from 1920‚Äì1930. This quality is to such a high degree that the 1930‚Äì1940 houses are considered a contributing part of the district . They clearly convey the continuity of architecture present in Ridgewood. The later buildings ‚Äì post WWII, 1950s to the present, still retain the basic Colonial and Tudor Revival styles, but the richness of their surface quality is expressed to a lesser degree. These buildings, when viewed in the context of the district, maintain the continuity of Ridgewood architecture and serve as background buildings within the historic district. = Residents = Among Ridgewood's original residents were members of Canton's corporate elite. Members of the management of Republic Steel lived there as did managers from the two corporations that merged to form it ‚Äì Berger Manufacturing and United Alloy Steel. Thirteen top executives from the Timken Roller Bearing Company lived in Ridgewood, including two top Timkens, Robert and Henry. A number of the managers of other Canton industries, from stamping and enameling companies to water softener companies, provisioners and rubber companies, were Ridgewood residents as were professionals of all sorts‚Äîdoctors, lawyers, bankers, and educators.

She spent most of her childhood on area farms before attending St. Charles High School, where she was influenced by an arts-oriented curriculum and the principal, H. Clark Brown, who encouraged her to attend the University of Chicago in 1926. She studied art history and design for two years there, boarding with a family on Chicago's South Side, but was forced to take a year off to teach elementary school due to financial hardship caused by the Great Depression. She returned to complete her degree in 1930, supporting herself with an interior decorating job. During the next decade, she worked for RR Donnelley as a proofreader, traveled to Mexico with women friends (where she met lifelong friend and muralist, Alfredo Zalce), and took up progressive politics. She met her future husband, Sam Himmelfarb, at a Hyde Park activist meeting in the late 1930s. She and Himmelfarb married in 1939, remaining so until Sam's death in 1976. In 1940, they purchased an undeveloped property in rural Winfield, Illinois, intending to settle and raise a family there. In late 1942, they built and moved into a modernist, Usonian-influenced house designed by Sam, where Eleanor would live for the rest of her life.Scanlan, Patricia Smith. \\"Samuel Himmelfarb,\\" Modernism in the New City: Chicago Artists, 1920‚Äì1950.

Eleanor Himmelfarb, Inside or Out?, acrylic on canvas, 38\\" x 48\\", 1999 Himmelfarb's earlier work often referenced experiences of daily existence and drew comparisons to medieval tapestries with its patterns of flattened forms, which some writers suggest were influenced by her studio view of woodlands through the frames of flat window planes. Reviewers particularly noted her concern for composition and subtle sense of color and depth; Chicago Tribune critic Alan Artner described her 1986 show as lyrical, with \\"soft lozenges of color\\" that were \\"decorative in the best sense.\\" Her paintings in the 1990s employed gestural brushwork and free-floating imagery in fractured space, creating what curator Rene Paul Barilleaux called, \\"highly personal, often surreal renditions of nature\\" that \\"transcend the sense of tranquil isolation often associated with traditional landscape painting.\\" Referencing natural and human iconography, works such as Summertime and Wintertime I (1990) and Ephemerae III (1993) suggested enigmatic aspects of the life cycle and the interconnectedness of the universe.

She introduced metaphors of passage with her \\"Gate\\" and \\"Fence\\" series (1998‚Äì2003), relating these barriers which physically invite or restrain to memories that arise and fade, and in formal terms, to shapes and colors that advance, retreat, ascend or descend. Critics noted in this work the emergence of color as an emotional force, capable suggesting the otherworldly glow of twilight or the hazy light of Indian summer in paintings such as Inside or Out? (1999) or Gate to the Prairie (1998). In late works (e.g., Daily Bread and Riviera, 2007), Himmelfarb developed a synthesis of earlier strategies and references, employing calligraphic and flat forms, stylized imagery, and outline in some of the most complex compositions of her career.

She instructed for more than 30 years (1967‚Äì2001)‚Äîinto her early nineties‚Äîat the DuPage Art League in Wheaton, Illinois, mentoring some students for twenty years and providing a role model to women starting their art careers late in life due to family obligations.Oak Park-River Forest Patch. \\" Four Local Artists Exhibit \\"Abstract Collaboration\\" at Oak Park Public Library in September,\\" Patch, August 30, 2011.

She also taught painting and design at Roosevelt University, Rosary College, Triton College, and the College of DuPage; in 1993, she was artist-in-residence at Illinois State University. According to students, Himmelfarb's methods were conversational, embedded in modernist fundamentals, and directed toward helping each artist express their own vision while also challenging them to take risks. Conservation work Himmelfarb was a conservationist for many decades, including studies at the Morton Arboretum with naturalist May Watts, work with Roy Schulenberg to plant the Arboretum's Schulenberg Prairie‚Äîan early Midwest prairie restoration project, begun in 1962‚Äîand land protection efforts in the 2000s. She was a member of Winfield United, a group advocating responsible development, and when new developments began to encroach on the area, she worked with the Conservation Foundation in Illinois in 2003, at age 93, to establish a conservation easement that permanently limited development on her land; it was accepted in June 2005 by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. She also organized a meeting between the Conservation Foundation and her neighbors to educate them about easements; ultimately, several decided to establish them on their own properties.Meyer, H.

It is said to have been the first Chinese newspaper in Semarang. History Djawa Tengah launched in late 1909 under the editorial direction of H.C. Goldman, who had previously been editor of another Malay-language paper, Bintang Pagi (Malay: Morning star) which had ceased publication only a month earlier. Its early issues were printed partly in Malay and partly in Chinese, although the Chinese content was soon eliminated. During the 1910s, the paper developed an editorial line was moderately Chinese nationalist and critical of the Dutch Chinese Officer system. The paper also gave fair treatment in its coverage of the Indonesian National Awakening, often giving front page coverage to the details of Sarekat Islam meetings throughout the 1910s. By 1910 Goldman was already getting in trouble under the strict press censorship laws (Persdelict), for printing materials which \\"defamed\\" the character of state employees. He was eventually sentenced to a month in prison. It is unclear when he stepped down as editor in chief, but by 1914 the position was held by Tan Thwan King, a journalist from Malang who also edited Tjahaja Timoer, Andalas and other newspapers during the wartime period. In 1914 Tan also became embroiled in a Persdelict case, for which he was also sentenced to a month in prison for insulting a Chinese Officer in print. During the First World War, when the Indies were cut off from most international wire services, Djawa Tengah hired Theo Tong Hai, who had previously been editor of Sin Po, as a travelling correspondent and sent him to China and Japan try get more accurate reports about the state of things in Europe and Asia. After the war, Tan Thwan King apparently left his position, which was taken over by Kwee Kee Tie (usually known as K.T. Kwee), who held the position for the following decade. However, Tan continued to contribute, and wrote coverage of the 1918 Kudus riot for the paper. That riot became an important cause for the paper, and editor Kwee joined Auw Yang Kee, the Chinese consul to the Indies, on a visit to the city of Kudus to survey the damage in the week after the riot, and for several months the paper helped organize fundraising efforts for the victims. Another editor who joined the paper around the end of the war was Raden Mas Tjondrokoesoemo, an elite Javanese who may have helped contribute to the paper's good coverage of the Sarekat Islam and other Indonesian organizations. Tjondrokoesoemo left Djawa Tengah for its competitor Warna Warta in 1921 over a dispute about his editorial independence. Another was Kwik King Hien, a writer of Malay-language novels. Most of his novels appeared in serialized form in Djawa Tengah before being published as books. In 1922 several employees of Djawa Tengah were involved in the foundation of Chinese journalists' association, the Tjoe Piet Hwee. Although the founding meeting received delegates from other cities, almost all of the board were made up of people from Semarang, including the chairman Lauw Koug Huy, editor of competing paper Warna Warta, vice-chairman Yap Kong Hwat, a Djawa Tengah editor, and with Djawa Tengah's editor in chief Kwee as treasurer. The organization set out to defend the interests of the Indonesian Chinese and their newspapers and did not allow native Indonesians as members. In 1927, Kwee left and an English-educated economist Chan Kok Cheng became the new editor-in-chief. He was very well-connected, being a close friend of Kwee Kek Beng and Liem Khoen Hien. A noteworthy feature of his tenure at the paper were his articles about birth control, almost unheard of in the Malay press at the time, and which he later published as a book. Chan was also active in the Partai Tionghoa Indonesia, a political party, and founded its Semarang chapter in 1932. Around 1930 the journalist and historian Liem Thian Joe, who had previously been editor of Warna Warta and Perniagaan, joined the editorial staff of the paper of Djawa Tengah. He published a serialized version of his history of Semarang, Riwajat Semarang 1416‚Äì1931 in Djawa Tengah Review, the paper's newly launched monthly magazine, between March 1931 and July 1933.

The Role of Religion in American Life: An Interpretative Historical Anthology. University Press of America. p. 251. He studied under Horace Bushnell at Yale Divinity School. After graduating in 1855, Munger began preaching in Massachusetts. In 1885, he was appointed pastor of the United Church in New Haven, Connecticut. Munger was an advocate of theistic evolution. He argued that \\"evolution not only perfects our conception of the unity of God, but... strengthens the argument from design\\".Mathisen, Robert R. (2006). Critical Issues in American Religious History. Baylor University Press. p. 408. However, Munger rejected the concept of survival of the fittest.Sasaki, Motoe. (2016).

New Haven: The University. p. 1179 He died on January 11, 1910. Famous Quotation Munger is well known for a famous quotation which is usually misattributed to others. In his 1884 book On the Threshold he wrote the following: \\"A purpose is the eternal condition of success. Nothing will take its place. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men of talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is a proverb. Education will not; the country is full of unsuccessful educated men. There is no road to success but through a clear, strong purpose.\\" This is extracted from a larger quote in the book. This shortened version, with the word \\"persistence\\" replacing the word \\"purpose\\" is often misattributed to President Calvin Coolidge in 1929. But the true source was Munger.

Biography  ETA killed Jos√© Ignacio Iruretagoyena in Zarauz on January 9, 1998. He was a woodworker and Councillor of People's Party in the city of Zarauz. He was married, and he had two children. At the time of his murder, he was 35 years old. = Murder = In the weeks leading up to January 8, 1998, ETA's member Gregorio Escudero Balerdi monitored Jos√© Ignacio Iruretagoyena. The information obtained from these surveillances was also passed it to ETA's members Francisco Javier Garc√≠a Gaztelu, alias Txapote and Irantzu Gallastegui Sodupe, alias Amaya. Gregorio Escudero moved Garcia Gaztelu and Irantzu Gallastegui from the town of Andoain to A√±orga's halt. From there, they took a train to Zarautz. Once in Zarauz and on the information they had., they localized Jose Ignacio Iruretagoyena's vehicle. The vehicle was parked in a parking place. Irantzu Gallastegui set an explosive device placed under the seat of the driver. The device, manufactured by ETA, contained between 1.5 and 2 kilograms of ammonal and chloratite, and a timer. Txapote was surveillance the area while Amaya was setting up the bomb. The two ETA's members returned by train, being picked up in the halt of A√±orga and transferred to Andoain's town by Gregorio Escudero. On January 9, 1998, at 7:40 a.m. Jos√© Ignacio Iruretagoyena took his car and head to his job. After driving for a few meters, the artifact exploded around 7:50 a.m. at Urdaneta's street. As soon as the explosion was produced several passers-by found Jos√© Ignacio, who had lost several limbs of the body. The victim asked for help in Basque's language. They tried to revive him without success. The explosion caused injuries to a passer-by, witness of what happened, damage to a nearby building, another vehicle and the road. The Police cordoned off the area. Then, the judge proceeded to lift the corpse. The Basque City Halls made silent concentrations to convict the assassination. The second section of the room of Criminal Court issued decision 22/2006, on May 18, 2006, in which it condemned Gregorio Escudero Balerdi to 42 years of prison. He obtained 25 years for terrorist murder and 17 years for a crime of terrorist havoc. He was also sentenced to economically compensate the heirs of Jos√© Ignacio Iruretagoyena for an amount of 120,000 euros. Also, this resolution also established the prohibition for the convicted person to return to Zarauz for the next five years and the payment of damages that caused by the attack. This section also agreed on the conclusion of the proceedings and the opening of oral proceedings for Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu and Irantzu Gallastegui Sodupe. After the oral hearing, the decision 78/2009, issued December 17, sentenced each one of them to 46 years in prison. They obtained 18 years for a crime of terrorist murder and 18 years for another crime of terrorist havoc. They were also forbidden from approaching the town of Zarauz or the residence of the victims and keep a distance of 500m. They were sentenced to an economic compensation of 200,000 euros to his widow and 100,000 euros to each of Jos√© Ignacio's sons, as well as to cope with the damage caused by the attack.

The distillery was located close to Newbridge Street on the River Cam-Cor (meaning ‚Äòcrooked weir‚Äô). The three storey, quadrangular distillery was a substantial distillery at one stage with an annual output of 200,000 gallons, but not much is known about it today.  History  There were five distilleries in County Offaly, but by 1818 there were only two in operation which were both located at Birr. In the late 1840s, one of the distilleries closed, and the other was purchased by the Wallace Brothers who are only known by their initials R and J. Birr Distillery consisted of a malting floor, kiln and mill, mash tun, still room, spirit store and bonded warehouse. The Wallace brothers kept Birr Distillery in business up to 1889 until a fire broke out and put an end to the distillery. A worker fell asleep and the friction caused by the millstone ignited the surrounds. As the fire spread, casks exploded and there are reports that state ‚Äòthe whiskey flowed in a flaming mass down the Camcor River, turning it into a great swirling and flaming Christmas pudding,‚Äô Many locals are said to have lined the town‚Äôs bridge with buckets to scoop up the water. In 1886, before the fire, a description of the distillery is given. Alfred Barnard, a British brewing and distilling historian visited the distillery. He notes that the building was made of limestone, that it was approached by carriage along the river, and that an impressive stone archway, draped in ivy lead up to the distillery. He also recorded how the building was split into two sections, with two main grain warehouses and two drying kilns positioned across the bank of the Camcor River, but he doesn‚Äôt mention how each section (grainery and distillery) were accessed across the river. There were only two old pot stills in the Still House, which is evidence of a double distillation process. There were 13 bonded warehouses which contained 3,000 casks and the 40 men employed contributed to the supposed 200,000 gallons that Birr reportedly produced and sold all over Ireland, England and the British Colonies. Barnard visited 28 distillers in Ireland, and although there is the least information available on Birr, to this day, it is one of the most intact distilleries in-spite of its abandonment. In the 1990s, it was bought by an English family who converted it to a summer house, while the other buildings across the river were converted into apartments.

There are 6 branches in Switzerland and 9 branches in the United States under its American subsidiary American Lamprecht Transport. As one of the main logistics companies in Switzerland, it has been in existence for more than 70 years. Lamprecht Transport has been run by the Lamprecht family in Switzerland for three generations.  History  Lamprecht Transport was founded in 1945 by Adolf Lamprecht right after World War 2, which was documented in a 1945 article by the Swiss newspaper Basellandschaftliche Zeitung. Its first transport was a cargo of 90 tons of fresh fish from Denmark to Switzerland in 1945 that made its way through the destruction of war-torn Germany.Lamprecht Transport AG - ein Begriff im Skandinavien-Verkehr. No. 43: 26 October 1990. From its humble roots in post- war Europe, Lamprecht Transport has since ridden the post-war European economic boom to become a key logistics provider in Europe.Lamprecht Museum exhibit In 1945, Lamprecht Transport opened its branch office at Zurich Airport, and focused on booming air freight coming in and out of there.Lamprecht Transport timeline. In 1955, the company got into the transit traffic business between Germany and Italy. In the 1950s, it also gained a foothold in other European countries. A German subsidiary was later founded in Singen, a southern German town on the border with northern Switzerland. In 1965, further offices were opened in Geneva. As trans-Atlantic air freight greatly expanded during the 1960s, Lamprecht Transport expanded into the United States and founded its subsidiary American Lamprecht Transport, Inc. After the death of Adolf Lamprecht, Sr., his son Adolf Lamprecht, Jr. took over corporate management. In 1991, Thomas Lamprecht took over management of the company. Under Thomas Lamprecht's leadership, Lamprecht Transport continued to steadily expand, and has gone into new areas including trade fair and event logistics and pharmaceutical logistics.  Lamprecht Museum  Lamprecht Transport also runs and maintains Lamprecht Museum, a history museum in Basel that is open to the public. The museum is located close to the Basel SBB railway station in downtown Basel. There are many exhibits on the history of transport and logistics in Europe starting from the end of World War 2.Lamprecht Museum The museum provides a fascinating insight into the evolution of freight transport during Europe's post-war economic miracle.  Services  Lamprecht Transport internationally transports diverse goods, including chemicals and pharmaceutical products, machinery, food products, and electronics.

In 1856, Mary was born in Kennebunk, Maine, the eldest of three children of the congregational minister William H. Willcox and his wife Annie Holmes n√©e Goodenow. Theirs was a distinguished family in Maine; her great grandfather, John Holmes, was one of the state's first senators, while her grandfather, Daniel Goodenow, was justice of the Supreme Court of Maine. Her brother, Walter Francis Willcox, became professor of economics and statistics at Cornell University. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Reading, Massachusetts, where Mary studied at Salem State Normal School in 1875. She taught at the Frederick Female Seminary in Maryland, 1875‚Äì76, and Charlestown High School in Boston, 1876‚Äì78. During the summers of 1877 and 1878, she attended the marine laboratory of Alexander Agassiz. She studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Society of Natural History from 1878 to 1880. For her undergraduate education, in 1880 Wilcox traveled to England and studied at Newnham College. She completed her studies in 1883, but, at the time, Cambridge University did not grant degrees to women. With the help of her father, Wilcox gained a position in the zoology department at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Her mother, however, regretted the decision since it meant \\"giving up all possibilities of marriage\\". Very little in the way of zoological course work had been developed at Wellesley to that point, and Wilcox had the task of essentially building a zoology department from scratch. She introduced a number of innovative teaching methods. For a time, her department became one of the foremost in the country, attracting a number of women who would become productive zoologists. Her interest during this period was in ornithology, and in 1895 she published Pocket Guide to the Common Land Birds of New England. To improve her job security at Wellesley, in 1896 she took a leave of absence to study for a Ph.D. at the University of Zurich. In 1898 she was at the Naples Zoological Station. She completed her degree program in 1898 with a dissertation On the Anatomy of Acmaea fragilis (Chemnitz), and was allowed to return to her position at Wellesley as head of the department. Much of her research at the college was on comparative anatomy of molluscs, a phylum of invertebrate animals, and of Acmaeidae, a family of sea snails. She authored a number of scientific papers in zoological publications. Her last paper, published in 1906, was on the anatomy of Acmaea testudinalis. Willcox retired in 1910 as professor emeritus, supposedly as a result of poor health. The exact cause is unclear, but a 1928 letter mentioned rheumatism. Following retirement she became active in the League of Women Voters, Federation of Women's Clubs, National Audubon Society, and the Boston Society of Natural History. She died at her home in Pocasset, Massachusetts, some 43 years after her retirement.

According to the list deposited at the ministry when the film was resubmitted, several sequences were cut or shortenend, among them the shots in hell containing female frontal nudity and other sex and nude scenes as well a close-up of Brother Alessio in the barrel of excrements, while the first episode was completely reshot without nudity. Since the film's original director Joe D'Amato was at the time already working as cinematographer on Alberto de Martino's Counselor at Crime in the United States, the direction of the reshoot was given to Franco Lo Cascio. The film ended up being 106 metres, i.e. approximately 4 minutes, shorter. It passed when it was resubmitted under its current title on April 18, 1973. Release The film was theatrically released in Italy. It was later distributed on VHS by Shendene & Moizzi in their \\"Collezzione decamerotico\\".

He served in both the Colorado Territory legislature and the legislature of the State. He was known as the \\"Father of the Colorado Senate\\" and served for 40 years. According to scholars, Barela's legacy in Colorado would show a willingness to work for the business class but to also guard the Hispanic culture and Spanish language speaking populace from the newer culture being introduced from the east, all while acting as a politician-patron for the people of Trinidad, Colorado.  Early years  Born on March 4, 1847 in what would become New Mexico, Casimiro Barela was born in the middle of the U.S.-Mexican War that ended in 1848. Barela was born in the town of Embudo, which at the time was still a part of Mexico, but following the war became a U.S. territory. At a young age, Barela briefly dropped out of school to help his father, Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Barela, working as a cattle raiser. It was out in fields, where he frequently brought books to read aloud to his father, that Casimiro Barela's father said: \\"My son, from today forward you will no longer assist me in my work; by all means, you will go to school\\". From then forward, Casimiro valued his education and prioritized his studies in his young, formative years.  Moving to Colorado  In 1867, Casimiro Barela moved from New Mexico to about 20 miles outside of Trinidad, Colorado. In Colorado, Barela slowly gained a great fortune by doing a variety of crafts, including: stock raising sheep and cattle, publishing newspapers, freighting, and merchandising. On his twentieth birthday, he married Josefita Ortiz, a daughter of a well-known family in the Colorado territory. When he was just twenty-two years old, Casimiro Barela was elected as Justice of the Peace in Trinidad, beginning his political career. Political career After being elected as Justice of Peace in Trinidad, Barela was named County Assessor in 1870. While serving in this new position, in 1871 by popular vote, Barela was also elected representative to the Territorial Legislature. While fulfilling his public offices, Barela also found success with his several businesses on the side, and enjoyed spending time with his wife and young daughters in the early 1870s. In 1875, Casimiro Barela helped to write the Colorado State Constitution, and he guaranteed its publication in English, Spanish, and German. While fighting for the publication in multiple languages, Barela stated, \\"You may say that ignorance of the law does not excuse the breaking of it. I say it is the only excuse.\\" Casimiro Barela served as a Delegate to the 1880 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio and the 1888 Democratic National Convention in St, Louis, Missouri. In addition to his service as County Assessor and Justice of Peace, Casimiro also served as County Sheriff for Las Animas, ran a blacksmith and supply shop, and was a postmaster.  In the Colorado Senate  Following his role in the publication of the Colorado State Constitution in 1875, Casimiro Barela became a Colorado State Senator in 1876. While in the Senate, Casimiro Barela accomplished many political and social gains such as: * Advocating for bilingual education, as many residents living in Southern Colorado had Mexican origins. * Supporting the women's suffrage movement in Colorado in 1893, making Colorado one of the first states to allow women to vote prior to the 19th Amendment. * Bringing Congress's attention to the Mexicans that became U.S. citizens because of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, that were losing their land claims in the New Mexico territory. * Helping push for New Mexico's statehood. * Making Columbus Day an official holiday in 1907. Casimiro Barela served for almost 40 years in the Senate, from 1876 to 1917. After gaining his seat in the first Colorado State Senate elections in 1876, he was reelected nine times. He lost his seat in the Senate in a surprising defeat by Democrat Samual de Busk in 1916. In addition, Casimiro started his career as a Democrat but later switched to the Republican party.  Family life  Casimiro Barela married twice in his lifetime. He had nine children with his first wife, Josefita Ortiz. Only three of the children survived and in 1883, Josefita died. Barela would remarry the following year on February 16 to Se√±orita Damiana Rivera, who is recorded as having come from \\"one of the most distinguished families in the Territories of New Mexico\\". Together with his second wife, Casimiro adopted three more children. Senator Barela died on December 18, 1920.  Recognition  Senator Barela, while alive and posthumously, has received many awards and has been recognized by many as \\"Father of Colorado State\\". Some of his accolades include: * An installation of stain glass of Casimiro Barela in the dome of the Colorado Capitol in 1900, making him one of sixteen people honored in this way. * Earning the \\"Legacy Award\\" for the 2016 Colorado Latino Hall of Fame.

Early life and education  Dzirasa was born to Abigail, a nurse, and Samuel Dzirasa, a civil engineer. His parents were from Accra, Ghana, and moved to the United States in 1971. Dzirasa grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. While he was in college he met one of his childhood heroes who specialized in brain science. He was an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where he received a Meyerhoff Scholarship. He switched from chemistry to chemical engineering at UMBC. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 2001. He joined Duke University with the intention of completing a PhD in biological engineering and designing neuroprosthetics. After visiting the schizophrenia ward at Duke University, Dzirasa switched to medicine. He earned a PhD in neurobiology in 2007. He was awarded the Duke University Somjen Award for Outstanding Dissertation Thesis. He was the first African-American student to graduate with a doctorate in neurobiology from Duke. He completed his MD in 2009. His graduate work was supported by the Ruth K. Broad Biomedical Research Fellowship, the UNCF-Merck Graduate Science Research Fellowship and the Wakeman Fellowship. He was inspired to focus on mental illness after watching his family members suffer from bipolar disorder and completed his residency training in psychiatry in 2016.  Career  Dzirasa is interested in how mechanisms in neural circuits underpin emotional behavior. His ultimate aim is to use neuroelectrical stimulation to treat mental illness. He has considered the fluctuations of local field potential oscillations in the brain. Dzirasa developed a multi- circuit in vivo recording technique that can be used with selective modulation using designer drugs. He used machine learning to identify a spatiotemporal dynamic network that can predict depression. He has looked at how the electrical patterns in the brain impact of mice cope with stress; finding that mice who were more sensitive to stress had higher activation in their prefrontal cortex compared to the less sensitive mice. He demonstrated that the network is distinct biologically from the networks that are dysfunctional after stress. His work was featured on CBS in 2011. He is an Associate Professor at Duke University, where he served on the advisory committee of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative. In 2016 Dzirasa was awarded the PECASE for his work on the interaction of genes under stress. He has also looked at the characterisation of sensorimotor gating in schizophrenic patients. His goal is to design a pacemaker for the brain that can regulate the electrical signals that underlie mental disorders. = Advocacy and academic service = Dzirasa delivered a TED talk at TEDMED, where he discussed curing mental disorders with electronic engineering. He spoke at the Aspen Ideas Festival about how to use technology to transform mental illness. He has also spoken at the National Academy of Medicine, Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, McLean Hospital and One Mind. Dzirasa is interested in providing education about health to underserved communities. He is committed to improving diversity within the academic community, and founded the Association of Underrepresented Minority Fellows in 2007. He has served on the Board of Directors of the Student Medical Association, which looks to eradicate health disparities. He is a mentor for the Meyerhoff Scholarship Program. Dzirasa is committed to the undergraduate community at Duke University, and welcomes trainee students to his lab every year - in particular those from underrepresented groups. = Awards and honors = 2019 AAAS Leshner Fellowship * 2016 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers * 2016 White House Frontiers Conference * 2016 Duke Medical Alumni Emerging Leader Award * 2013 Sidney Baer Prize for Schizophrenia Research * 2011 International Mental Health Research Organization Rising Star Award * 2008 Ebony magazine‚Äôs 30 Young Leaders of the Future * 2007 Charles Johnson Leadership Award  References  African-American physicians American psychiatrists African-American engineers University of Maryland, Baltimore County alumni Duke University alumni Duke University faculty Neuroscientists American neuroscientists 1978 births Living people ","title":"Kafui Dzirasa"},{"id":"60010838","text":"Belisario is a given name.

He was awarded the National Prize for Human Rights in 2016. Biography =First years= He was born in Santiago, Chile, the son of Carlos Aldunate Err√°zuriz and Adriana Lyon Lynch, and was the second of four siblings: Carlos, the eldest, plus two younger sisters, Mar√≠a and Pelagia. From a wealthy family, he was educated by governesses brought from England, so he learned to speak English before Spanish. In 1928, the Aldunate Lyon family moved to England, where they remained until 1930. Jos√© Aldunate studied at the Jesuit college Stonyhurst College, in Lancashire, with his brother Carlos, while his sister attended at Saint college in London. For Jos√© Aldunate, his time in England was decisive: > I had some success in rugby and I was successful in the studio, the first > years but not the last ones. Generally in the first year, even in English, > he beat the others. \\"I had no problem in terms of language. That was my > English period. It was not very long, from 1928 to 1930. However, they were > very decisive years in my life. We can say that I forged my character, who I > was.\\" Jos√© Aldunate Jos√© Aldunate dedicated the first months of 1933 to his profession. Finally, he found answers in reading the stories of the disciples of St. Francis of Assisi and in February he decided to become a Jesuit which is a scholarly religious congregation of the Catholic Church . > \\"They chose that life, to travel around the world on foot without carrying > anything, living on charity, speaking to the people of God. the idea of > leaving the ordinary life attracted me a lot. That to marry, to have a farm, > to manage and have a lot of money or responsibilities did not come to me at > all.\\" Jos√© Aldunate =Formation, positions and missions in the Society of Jesus= In March 1933, Jos√© Aldunate entered the Jesuit Novitiate in Chile. On April 1, 1935, he made his first religious profession of vows as members of the Christian Schools. He moved to Argentina for the first years, then he went to Antofagasta for his Magisterium, during which he taught at San Luis school. Later, he returned to Argentina to finish his studies in Theology. On December 23, 1946, he was ordained as a priest in San Miguel, Buenos Aires. He then traveled to Europe to study Religious Studies and Ethics, first in Rome, then in the Pontifical Gregorian University and, finally, in the Catholic University of Leuven (1835‚Äì1968) .He got his doctorate degree in economics and ethics at the school of Luigi Taparelli D'Azeglio. In 1950, he returned to Chile. His first task, entrusted by the provincial father √Ålvaro Lav√≠n, was to assist Father Alberto Hurtado in the Chilean Trade Union Action (ASICH),del Padre Hurtado something of great interest for Aldunate made possible relating Ethics and Economics, the subject of his graduation thesis. The inheritance left to Jos√© Aldunate by Father Hurtado was two main lessons: the importance of justice and the helping the poor. > \\"There came a time when Father Hurtado understood that the decisive things > were not charity, kindness, doing good, but justice. Society must first seek > justice, which is beyond charity. You have to be fair in the first place and > then think about being charitable. A businessman had to pay fair wages and > then he could do charity.\\" Jos√© Aldunate In addition to his work at the ASICH, Jos√© Aldunate began his work as a professor of ethics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. In 1952 he was also Master of Novices; then, director of the Message magazine and director of the Center of Sociocultural Investigations CISOC- Bellarmine; finally, he was named Provincial of the Jesuits in Chile. The 1960s were marked by changes in the world and in the Church, with the Second Vatican Council, which defined the course of Aldunate. =Life as a Jesuit worker= Although it was a normal thing in his career to ascend and learn experience and work over the years, for Father Jos√© Aldunate life took another direction so far as a Director of the Jesuits of Chile he decided to become a worker priest. > I had fulfilled my Provincial duties, then I felt freer. I said why I didn't > try a little insertion in the workers' world? If I was talking about justice > in my class as a ethics teacher,I had a feeling that I was not taking > responsibility for what the justice really is. Jesus says that not the one > who speaks out but the one who does the will of God complete it. I > remembered \\"Father Gatica\\",who preaches did not practice. I did not want to > be a Father Gatica, but I saw that I did not approach the one who suffered > injustice. Jos√© Aldunate In 1973, he received an invitation from a Dutch priest Juan Caminada, and accepted to attend a month of contemplation in order to become a worker priest, in Calama. For Caminada, a worker priest must become a true worker to rethink his vocation and the Church, since, for him, only a real insertion makes it possible to comment on how the Church should be renewed. Father Aldunate moved to Calama to join with 14 priests and live with them a month of contemplation, and then interrupted by a week of work in Chuquicamata and He finished in August 1973, anyone who discerned and wanted to continue in the movement.Father Aldunate took the option of becoming a worker, \\"but without leaving the chair, being a worker who teaches ethics not only in theory but in the same praxis.\\" In practice, he decided to work as a worker for six months of a year and continue with his academic work at the Catholic University for the other six months,a routine education that he maintained for about five years.

Background  Between the drought and poor harvests of 1881 and 1882, social tensions and hunger in Andalusia led to theft, robberies, and arson. There were raids on farms and riots in protest of lack of work. Insurgents demanded that the town council give them jobs in public works. Among the most serious urban riots, on November 3, 1882, in Jerez de la Frontera, about 60 people were arrested as the Civil Guard and army intervened. Owners were fearful of the rioters, who otherwise did not act in personal aggression or face farmhouse guards and the Civil Guard. The liberal press in Madrid denounced the dire circumstances of Andalusian day laborers in late 1882. An editorial in the newspaper El Imparcial described the looting of bakeries and butchers out of hunger, and having to choose between alms, theft, and death. Leopoldo Alas reported on hunger in Andalusia in a series of articles for El D√≠a. By the end of 1882, the rains had returned and Andalusian agricultural laborers of the new Federaci√≥n de Trabajadores de la Regi√≥n Espa√±ola decided to strike to raise their salaries at the prospect of a good harvest.  History  = Finding the Black Hand = Group of accused prisoners In early November 1882, a member of the Civil Guard in Western Andalusia sent the government a discovered copy of the \\"regulations\\" of a secret socialist organization, \\"la Mano Negra, or \\"the Black Hand\\". In the official report that accompanied it, these regulations proved the conspiracy of a group starting fires, felling forests, and murdering others over prior months. These regulations were two documents: \\"The Black Hand: Regulation of the Society of the Poor, against their thieves and executioners, Andalusia\\", and another simply titled, \\"Statutes\\", which did not use the phrase \\"Black Hand\\" but explained the governing rules of a People's Court to be established in each locality to punish crimes of the bourgeoisie. The former spoke of \\"the rich\\". The government sent Civil Guard reinforcements to C√°diz province two weeks after receiving the documents. The 90 guardias arrived in Jerez on November 21 whereupon they proceeded, with the help of the Jerez municipal guard, to arrest many day laborers and FRTE members as assumed associates of the Black Hand. By early December, a newspaper reported that the guardias had captured hundreds of Black Hand internationalists, their weapons, and their documentation. Within several weeks, 3,000 day laborers and anarchists had been imprisoned, though labor historian Josep Termes reported an even higher number: 2,000 in C√°diz and 3,000 in Jerez. In reports sent to the Ministry of Labor, the most common reason for detention was membership in the Federaci√≥n de Trabajadores (FTRE). The federation's publication, , decried the indiscriminate arrest of their members.  Authenticating the documents  The authenticity of the documents, which the Civil Guard claimed to have found under a rock, and its proof of the Black Hand's existence has been the subject of multiple historians. Manuel Tu√±√≥n de Lara thought that the document appeared fabricated. He doubted its test of authenticity to be legally or historically valid. Josep Termes wrote that the Black Hand was a police fabrication and that the Civil Guard's found documents were from the older N√∫cleo Popular collection. Historian Clara Lida wrote that the underground documents' characteristics resembled those of the prior era and that the name \\"Black Hand\\" would inconspicuously fit alongside those of other European, clandestine groups in the anarchist and revolutionary tradition. The act of resurfacing documents from years ago to make dormant threats appear contemporary, Lida wrote, was a duplicitous manipulation of the sensationalist press to steer public opinion against the organized day laborers. Juan Avil√©s Farr√© wrote that the documents, most likely, were genuine but from two different organizations of unknown identity. The first document‚Äî\\"The Black Hand\\"‚Äîwas likely acquitted by the Jerez municipal guard several years earlier, sent by the Civil Guard to the Minister of War, and forgotten until someone attempted to solve the Jerez crimes of 1882. This document did not mention the First International. The second document came from the clandestine period of the First International's Spanish Regional Federation between 1873 and 1881. = Crimes of the Black Hand = Present day view of San Jos√© del Valle, where the corpse of \\"El Blanco de Benaocaz\\" was discovered and attributed to the Black Hand The C√°diz and Madrid press did not question the existence of the Black Hand and, instead, sensationalized it. El Cronista de Jerez wrote that members of the Black Hand were killed in punishment when unable to carry out an assassination. The FTRE's Revista Social condemned the press's emphasis on treating news production as if it were a competition. The press focused on three crimes attributed to the Black Hand, with emphasis on two. After the first wave of arrests, on December 4, a married couple, innkeepers, were killed on the road to Trebujena, near Jerez de la Frontera. Two months later, on February 4, a young peasant named Bartolom√© Gago, better known as \\"El Blanco de Benaocaz\\" was found interred in an open field on the outskirts of San Jos√© del Valle, near Jerez. The murder was later said to have occurred the same day as the innkeepers'.DOCUMENTO IN√âDITO SOBRE LA MANO NEGRA: ‚ÄúAveriguaci√≥n de lo ocurrido con respecto al suicidio del reo condenado a muerte Cayetano de la Cruz Exp√≥sito‚Äù La Alcubilla. Bolet√≠n Digital de Historia de Jerez, N¬∫ 0. DICIEMBRE de 2016. This murder became known as the crime of Parrilla. Around the same time, a young ranch guard killed in August 1882 was discovered to have been caused not by accident but an assault to his abdomen. The government sent a special judge to Jerez to investigate the crimes in February 1883. The Cortes also debated the matter in late February. = Attempts to connect Mano Negra and the FTRE = The government, shopowners, and press‚Äîwith the newspaper El Liberal as an exception‚Äîassociated the Black Hand with the Federaci√≥n de Trabajadores (FTRE) for two purposes, according to historian Clara Lida: to halt the International's growing influence in the country, and more locally, to forestall farm workers from organizing and striking against the coming harvest. The FTRE's Federal Committee denied any connection to the Black Hand and repeated its denouncement of violence through propaganda and any solidarity with such criminal groups. It emphasized the difference between the growing anarchosyndicalism of Catalonia and the illegalism of Andalusia. The anarchist Peter Kropotkin's newspaper, Le R√©volt√©, based in Geneva, sympathized with the workers attributed as part of the Black Hand and criticized the FTRE's lack of solidarity with them. In March, the FTRE's Federal Committee published a manifesto against the government's attempts to associate the federation with the Black Hand.  Legal proceedings  Spanish Supreme Court at time of reading the sentence on the appeal of the trial for the murder of El Blanco de Benaocaz In June 1883, the Jerez court sentenced seven people and eight accomplices to 17 years and four months of prison. Two people were acquitted, but the prosecutor appealed the sentence to the Supreme Court, who ruled in April 1884 in favor of the death penalty for all but one accused. Nine sentences were commuted to jail time and seven were executed by garrote two months later in Jerez de la Frontera's Plaza del Mercado. Three days later, the judges were recognized by the Order of Isabella the Catholic.Luciano Boada y Valladolid, presidente, y Manuel L√≥pez de Azcutia, teniente fiscal del Tribunal Supremo fueron condecorados con la Gran Cruz del Orden de Isabel la Cat√≥lica. V√©ase: Diario oficial de avisos de Madrid 17.6.1884 A√±o CXXVI num.169 In the murders of the innkeepers, one of the five people who attacked the husband at dawn on December 4 and stabbed the couple was shot dead at the scene of the crime. The other four were sentenced to death but never executed. In the death of the ranch guard, two people were tried and one was sentenced to a long prison term. Afterwards, the FRTE's La Revista Social showed solidarity with workers but not with the condemned. In the clandestine newspaper of , an illegalist and anarcho-communist group that had split from the FTRE, lamented that the Jerez executions went uncontested. Execution of four alleged members of the Black Hand = Campaign in favor of the condemned = Nearly two decades later, the Madrid-based, anarchist newspaper Tierra y Libertad launched a campaign to release the eight convicts who remained in jail. Soledad Gustavo, partner of Joan Montseny, led the effort in January 1902 and was joined by other European newspapers, both anarchist and not. They held several meetings in Paris akin to those held in opposition to the Montju√Øc trial. They portrayed the convicts as heroes of anarchism, among the first to fight social iniquities, and victims of a large crime against the proletariat. Accordingly, the group portrayed the murdered, including El Blanco de Benaocaz, as traitors and informers. The convicts denounced their crimes in letters to the newspapers, writing that their confessions were coerced through torture. The Spanish government attempted to fight the campaign until early 1903, when it commuted the sentences to exile.  Consequences  The third congress of the FTRE, held in Valencia in October 1883, blamed the Black Hand affair for its reduced attendance. The group again protested attempts to affiliate their organization with the Black Hand, condemned groups engaged in illegal acts, and agreed to dissolve the organization if it could not act legally. Josep Llunas, a member of the FTRE Federal Committee, accused the government of using the Black Hand as pretext to repress anarchists. Fallout from the Black Hand affair pressured the FTRE Federal Committee, based in Barcelona, to retreat from the Andalusian movement to avoid guilt by association. They did not contest the government and press accounts of events. The Andalusian federations, in turn, were immediately angered. The result was an unbridgeable chasm within the FTRE that contributed to its decline in membership and dissolution five years later.  Historiographical debate  CNT headquarters in Jerez de la Frontera Historians offer differing accounts on the reality of the Black Hand organization. Tu√±√≥n de Lara affirms that there was no single organization, but small, anarcho-communist crime syndicates between secular rebellion and delinquency were used to justify the repression would precipitate the death of the FTRE. Termes called the affair a police set-up while acknowledging that agrarian Andalusia did experience violence. Avil√©s Farr√© demurred that the question of the Black Hand's existence was less important than what became as a result: the documents were likely real, but there was ultimately no activity ascribed to the group or evidence that the group either successfully formed or committed any crimes. If the group existed, it left no trace and even those convicted of crimes associated with the Black Hand had not heard of the organization. The found documents were presented by the police as evidence of a broad conspiracy that would explain the wave of violence that had been occurring across western Andalusia. Its pugnacious name inferred a diffuse, mysterious fear, and had journalist appeal. While Avil√©s Farr√© interpreted the documents to be written by someone attempting to found a clandestine group for purposes of class warfare (i.e., not forged), likely by hidden associates of FTRE's San Jos√© del Valle local, the historian said that there was no evidence that the group came into fruition or carried out its proposed threats. Whether the Black Hand affair was a false flag fabrication or, more simply, an unfounded government attempt to quell the agricultural revolts was the subject of Republican politician and writer Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez's 1905 sociological novel, La bodega.La bodega Historian and journalist Juan Madrid wrote that the governmental interest in associating anarchists with any crime capable of tarnishing their image has been a constant throughout the history of Spain and the world.Diario bah√≠a de C√°diz  References   Bibliography   *  Further reading    External links  La leyenda de La Mano Negra * Alegato del fiscal en el proceso de La Mano Negra * Sentencia del proceso de La Mano Negra * La Mano Negra en contexto 1884 in politics 1883 in politics 1882 in politics 1884 in Spain 1883 in Spain 1882 in Spain Anarchism in Spain History of anarchism Conspiracy theories in Spain Secret societies Trials in Spain Anarchist organizations Province of C√°diz History of Andalusia ","title":"Black Hand (Spain)"},{"id":"60010914","text":"Demonstrations were held throughout the United States on Presidents Day, February 18, 2019, in protest of President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to construct a new wall extending the barrier along the southern border.

The electricity is being sold to Tri-State Generation and Transmission (aka Tri-State) under a 25-year power purchase agreement. It is the second solar project, following the Cimarron Solar Facility in year 2010, to be added to the utility cooperative's renewables portfolio. Project details The facility occupies about 250 acres of semi-arid shortgrass prairie on the Colorado south-eastern plains, about 10 miles east of the base of the Rocky Mountains. It uses 120,960 polycrystalline silicon panels (Model SN-72cell: rated 310 Wp, ~16% efficiency) that the manufacturer, S-Energy, claims are less susceptible to potential-induced degradation. The panels are mounted in rows onto single-axis trackers to optimize electricity production throughout the day. The project was developed, constructed, and continues to be operated by Boulder-based juwi Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the German renewable energy company juwi AG. Construction began in March 2016 and employed about 400 workers, with Nesco serving as contractor for the civil structures. Commercial operation began in December 2016, with a dedication ceremony on July 14, 2017. The project was financed, and is owned by PSEG Solar Source, a subsidiary of New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group. The completed facility cost about US$60 million. On January 11, 2019 Tri-State and juwi announced their development plan for the 100 MW Spanish Peaks Solar Project, which would be sited adjacent to San Isabel Solar Energy Center. Under their plan, juwi will continue to develop the project and Tri-State would buy the electricity under a 15-year contract. A construction start is being targeted for year 2022, with completion in 2023. If funded, it may be the fourth solar project, following the Alta Luna Solar Facility in 2017, to be added to Tri-State's renewables portfolio.

Johnson in March 1902 The Cleveland Traction Wars was a political conflict in Cleveland, Ohio, which surrounded the question of whether or not municipal ownership would be applied to the city's streetcar system. It was a key issue during the mayoralty of Tom L. Johnson from 1901 to 1909.Big Plans: The Allure and Folly of Urban Design by Kenneth KolsonBaker, Newton D.

This was one of many issues on which Mayor Johnson, a Democrat and a proponent of municipal ownership, and Senator Mark Hanna, a Republican, came into conflict. Background Mayor Johnson Tom L. Johnson was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1901 as a proponent of municipal ownership. One of his campaign slogans had pertained to the operation of streetcars, proclaiming to champion, \\"three cent fares and universal transfers\\". During his tenure, Johnson oversaw the city takeovers of such services as garbage collection, street cleaning, and street lighting.Lough, A. W. (2016), Tom L.

Johnson's push for municipal ownership of the city's streetcars and power plants roused resistance.https://case.edu/ech/articles/m/municipal-ownership Although Johnson was blocked by state law from creating a municipal system, he arranged for the creation of a holding company to run city streetcars. Johnson believed that a three-cent fare could be implemented, replacing the five-cent fare. After the 1903 merger of the city's two streetcar companies (one being owned by Mark Hanna), Johnson's determination for municipal ownership strengthened. Johnson won reelection by again campaigning on the issue of a three-cent fare in 1907.Murdock, Eugene C. ‚ÄúCleveland's Johnson: The Burton Campaign.‚Äù The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, vol. 15, no. 4, 1956, pp. 405‚Äì424., [www.jstor.org/stable/3484289].

This data enabled seismology to become a quantitative science,. elucidated the focal mechanisms of earthquakes and the structure of the earth's crust,. and contributed to the development of plate tectonic theory.. The WWSSN is credited with spurring a renaissance in seismological research.. The WWSSN also \\"created a global network infrastructure, including the data-exchange procedures and station technical capabilities needed to support the establishment of the more advanced networks in operation today\\",. and has been the model for every global seismic network since then.. A principal feature of the WWSSN was that each station had identical equipment, uniformly calibrated. These consisted of three short-period (~1 second) seismographs (oriented north-south, east-west, and vertically), three long- period (~15 seconds) seismographs,. and an accurate radio-synchronized crystal-controlled clock.. The seismograms were produced on photographic drum recorders, developed on-site, then sent to a Data Center for copying onto 70-mm and 35-mm film (until 1978, and then after onto microfiche).. The WWSSN also featured a data distribution system that made this data available to anyone at nominal cost from a single location,. providing the basis for much research. says: \\"The network's significance for seismological research, not only in the US, can hardly be overestimated. The WWSSN recorded thousands of earthquakes each year, providing a wealth of high-quality data for a whole generation of scientists. The WWSSN arose from a political concern. In the 1950s concerns about radioactive fallout from above-ground testing of nuclear weaponsIn a famous case in 1954 a Japanese fishing boat was contaminated with fallout from a US test, resulting in serious illness in the crew, one of them dying . By 1962, as large tests by the US and USSR continued, atmospheric radioactivity had increased significantly, and there was concern about contamination of the food supply. There was particular concern that iodine-131, which accumulates in milk and presents a hazard to young children, was reaching a dangerous level . prompted the leadership of the three leading nuclear nations (President Eisenhower of the United States, General Secretary Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, and Prime Minister Macmillan of the United Kingdom) to ban further testing of nuclear weapons.. However, there was a hitch. The United States would not agree to banning kinds of nuclear tests where there was no capability to detect and identify any violations, and for smaller, underground tests seismology was not sufficiently developed to have that capability.. See also . The Eisenhower Administration therefore convened the Berkner panelNamed after its chairman, Lloyd Berkner. . to recommend ways to improve the nation's seismic detection abilities. The Berkner report, issued in 1959, was the basis of a comprehensive research and development program known as Project Vela Uniform, funded through the U.S. Department of Defense Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).; . Project Vela had two other subprojects, Vela Sierra and Vela Hotel, focused on the detection of high-altitude explosions using, respectively, ground-based and satellite-based detectors. , note 1. DARPA then funded the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&GS;) to implement one of the Berkner Report recommendations, designing and building what became the WWSSN.. Performance specifications and a request for proposals were published in November 1960, a contract awarded in early 1961, and the first station was installed in the C&GS; Albuquerque (New Mexico) Seismological Laboratory (ASL) in October 1961.. An additional 89 stations were installed by the end of 1963, and the network was essentially complete by the end of 1967 with 117 stations, with 121 stations eventually installed.. See for a list of stations installed as of June 1963. These were mostly outside of the U.S.,. but not in Canada (they had their own system), the Soviet-bloc countries, China or France (they were building their own nuclear weapons and wanted to retain an option for testing), or French-speaking countries.. DARPA funding ended in fiscal year 1967 (July 1966‚ÄìJune 1967), and plans for transferring funding responsibilities to the Commerce Department were blocked by an impasse in Congress.. Though other agencies contributed partial funding (mainly for purchase and shipping of photographic supplies), permanent funding was not obtained, and routine maintenance and training were suspended. In 1973 ASL and WWSSN were transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and operation of the network continued at a reduced level of support until it was terminated in 1996.. In the late 1970s digital recorders were added to 13 WWSSN stations; these \\"DWWSSN\\" stations operated as part of the Global Digital Seismographic Network (GSDN).. Successor to the WWSSN is the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), operated by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology.. A similar system, the Unified System of Seismic Stations (ESSN, transliterated from Russian), was built in the USSR with 168 stations using Kirnos seismographs..

It is the second work in the collection known as Theophanes Continuatus. It may have been written around 950 by the emperor's grandson, the Emperor Constantine VII, or perhaps by Theodore Daphnopates.Warren Treadgold, The Middle Byzantine Historians (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), p. 178. The Vita Basilii is a panegyric devoted to extolling Basil, both his personal virtues and his benevolent government. Although he was the first of his family on the throne, he is said to have noble ancestry. He is contrasted with the heroes of antiquity, rather than compared to them. Michael III, the emperor that Basil replaced, is portrayed as the anti-Basil and \\"the embodiment of evil\\". Under his benign rule, the peasants tilled their fields in peace. The emperor himself, in his capacity as a judge, is said to have protected the poor from unjust tax collectors. In general officials, such as tax collectors and especially eunuchs, are portrayed negatively. Constantine seeks to contrast the rule of his grandfather with that of Constantine's own father-in-law and co-emperor, Romanos I (920‚Äì45), who was not a Macedonian but a Lekapenos. The portrayal of Basil in the Vita is of a wise and just ruler and not a victorious soldier. His military career is described sparingly and his defeats are not glossed over. His architectural feats, however, such as his work on the Great Palace of Constantinople, are described in detail. The Vita was influenced by the biographies in Plutarch's Parallel Lives, mainly that of Mark Antony and possibly that of Nero,which is now lost.

The full title of the paper was Tjhoen Tjhioe: Soerat kabar dagang bahasa Melajoe jang moeat roepa kabar penting bagi bangsa Tionghoa (Malay: Tjhoen Tjhioe: Malay language Business newspaper containing important news for the Chinese nation). Although the paper only existed for a short time (from 1914 to 1918), during that time it was recognized as one of the top Chinese newspapers in the Indies, alongside Sin Po and Perniagaan. Cover page of Tjhoen Tjhioe from December 27, 1918. History The need for a new Peranakan Chinese newspaper in Surabaya was proposed in 1913, and it was suggested that Henri Borel, a Dutch Sinologist and writer who was in Europe at that time, return to the Indies and become its editor. The paper was explicitly intended to defend the Indies Chinese community, and particular that in Surabaya, and to cover news that might cause harm to that community. The salary being suggested to attract Borel was initially set at 1000 guilders per month, although when he took the job it was eventually reduced to 150 guilders. In the first issue in early 1914, Borel wrote an introductory essay which paid homage to Confucius and his ideas, and insisted that the paper would stand up for the brotherhood of all peoples. Starting from 1914, the Peranakan Chinese intellectual Kwee Hing Tjiat was editor of the paper as well. He had founded an earlier paper in Surabaya called Bok Tok which, according to historian Leo Suryadinata, was a sort of predecessor to Tjhoen Tjhioe. According to historian Ahmat Adam, Tjhoen Tjhioe had a circulation 4,000 subscribers in 1914, mainly from the Peranakan Chinese community.Adam, Ahmat. The Vernacular Press and the Emergence of Modern Indonesian Consciousness (1855-1913). No. 17. SEAP Publications, 1995. In its first year of publication, Tjhoen Tjhioe engaged in a war of words with Doenia Bergerak (Malay: World in motion), a left-wing paper associated with the Sarekat Islam movement. Tjhoen Tjhioe denounced that paper for using derogatory words for Chinese people such as babah or tjina, rather than employing the more respectful term tionghoa (Malay: Chinese). Like its more popular competitor Sin Po, Tjhoen Tjhioe strongly defended the Chinese community and became increasingly influenced by Chinese nationalist ideas. Historian Leo Suryadinata states that the paper had a \\"China orientation\\", that is an outlook that thought Chinese Indonesians should be focused on China and not on the Dutch East Indies. At the start of 1915 Henri Borel left the paper to become editor-in-chief of Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad. Rumours soon began to be printed in other papers that he had actually been fired from Tjhoen Tjhioe. These stated that he had been paid 150 guilders per month for the title of editor but did very little to justify the salary. Borel's replacement was apparently Tjan Kiem Bie, who was editor-in-chief in 1915 and 1916. Although it is unclear at what point he took the position, the novelist and journalist Tan Boen Kim must have been editor at the paper in 1915 as well, because he was charged under the strict press censorship laws (Persdelict) for defamation of a public official, and sentenced to fourteen days in prison. The next editor was Tjoe Bou San, who briefly held the post in 1917. Liem Koen Hian also worked for the paper, although the exact years are unclear. During his tenure there, he was very critical of the Dutch policy towards the Indonesian Chinese, notably the Dutch Nationality Law being proposed at the time, although he was careful to print his criticism in other newspapers such as Soerabaiasche Handelsblad. In the spring of 1918 the paper published an essay that soon being discussed more widely in the Dutch language press of the Indies. The article, by Tjondrokoesoemo, an elite Javanese who worked as an editor for various Chinese newspapers in his career (notably Djawa Tengah and Warna Warta), proposed that a new organization should be founded called Sarekat Tionghoa (Malay: Chinese Union) which could exist alongside the Sarekat Islam, which represented Muslim Indonesians.

As part of the relationship, the younger mokam√∂√∂na bears a child from an external male partner. The elder woman serves as a grandmother to the resulting child, thus securing her with an heir and ensuring the continuation of her lineage. Nyumba ntobhu marriages, like traditional Kuira marriages, are secured through the payment of a bride price in the form of cattle; in the case of nyumba ntobhu relationships, the bride price is provided by the older woman to the family of the younger partner. Among the Kuira, nyumba ntobhu couples make up an estimated 10 to 15 percent of households. Nyumba ntobhu relationships have become increasingly common within recent years.

Early life Tilford was born in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky on June 14, 1856. He was the son of Catherine Hunt (n√©e Curd) Tilford (1824‚Äì1908) and John Boyle Tilford (1812‚Äì1878), a banker and founder of the First National Bank of Lexington. His siblings included Richard Curd Tilford, Mary Jane (n√©e Tilford) Chastain, Wesley Hunt Tilford, Edward Alfred Tilford, and Frank Vincit Tilford. As a child, his family home was next door to the home of Henry Clay and John Hunt Morgan, and Henry obtained his early education in the South and then moved north to New York City with his father and brothers. Career With Jabez A. Bostwick, Tilford founded Bostwick & Tilford, a company that owned barges, lighters and a large refinery on the East River with headquarters at 138 Pearl Street.

Tilford retired in the Spring of 1911, however, in 1917, he joined the company's board of directors following the death of John Dustin Archbold in 1916. Two years later, Tilford was succeeded by Walter C. Teagle, who served as president of Standard Oil of New Jersey from 1917 until 1937. At the time of his death, he was associated with the National Fuel Gas Company. Personal life The Tilford mansion in Tuxedo Park, 1903.

Together, they were the parents of: * Isabelle Tilford (1887‚Äì1956), who married David Wagstaff (1882‚Äì1951), the son of Alfred Wagstaff Jr. and a Harvard graduate who was a member of the investment and merchant banking firm, Dominick & Dominick. * Katherine Hunt Tilford (1890‚Äì1970), who married Stanley Grafton Mortimer (1890‚Äì1947), a son of Richard Mortimer, in 1910. * Annette Tilford (1900‚Äì1946), who married Amory Lawrence Haskell (1893‚Äì1966) in September 1923. Tilford died on December 3, 1919 at the age of 63 at his home, 24 West 52nd Street in Manhattan. He was buried at St. Mary's Church Cemetery in Tuxedo Park, New York. His estate was valued at over $20,000,000 and he left approximately $17,000,000 to his family. In his will, he created trusts for each of his daughters where they received income from the trust until age 48 at which point they received the principal. After his death, his widow, who at $5,000,000 in 1920 had \\"the largest personal possessions among New Yorkers\\", remained socially prominent in Tuxedo Park and Palm Springs. She was known as \\"one of the reigning dowagers of Tuxedo Park\\" for four decades. According to author Sally Bedell Smith, \\"her annual debutante dinners before the Autumn Ball determined which young women were approved for New York society.\\" Mrs. Tilford, who gave up her New York townhouse to live at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, died at Woodland, her Tuxedo estate in 1941. =Descendants= Through his daughter Isabelle, he was the grandfather of Hunt Tilford Wagstaff (1909‚Äì1971) and David Wagstaff (1910‚Äì1984). Through his daughter Katherine, he was the grandfather of Stanley G. Mortimer Jr. (1913‚Äì1999), who was married to Babe Paley, and then Kathleen Harriman; Henry Tilford Mortimer (1916‚Äì1993), Richard Mortimer, Eve Mortimer (1918‚Äì2007), who married Clarence Pell, Jr., and later Lewis Cass Ledyard III; Katharine Mortimer (1923‚Äì2003), who married three times (including to Francis Xavier Shields and becoming grandmother of actress Brooke Shields); and John Jay Mortimer (1935‚Äì2013), a prominent financier.

In popular culture Reportedly, Tilford was the basis for the 2007 American drama film,There Will Be Blood, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. The film was inspired by Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! and tells the story of a silver miner-turned-oilman on a ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A fictionalized version of Tilford himself is portrayed in the film by David Warshofsky.

It opened around 1912 to cater to urban Finnish Americans who wished to maintain the Finnish sauna tradition. With It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for its local significance in the themes of architecture and social history. It was nominated for representing the strong influence of Finnish American culture on the Iron Range, and the commercial services developed to perpetuate it. Description The Finnish Sauna is a two-story brick building with a footprint. The primary fa√ßade contains an offset front door and four windows, two on each floor. The exterior brick is painted. The building has a flat roof that slopes to the rear. History Virginia's Finnish Sauna opened around 1912. Finnish immigrants had flocked to Minnesota's Iron Range to take jobs in the local mines. Enterprising Finnish Americans opened commercial saunas in many Iron Range communities in response to ongoing interest in this aspect of Finnish culture among miners and their families with no access to private saunas. Commercial saunas were more than just a place to get clean. They served as social centers for Finnish Americans, much as other groups might socialize at a coffee shop, bar, or bowling alley. Most of the Iron Range's commercial saunas closed as home saunas became more common in the 1950s. Virginia's sauna managed to stay in business longer, thanks to owners who valued its historical significance and a clientele of seniors on fixed incomes, migrant mine workers, and locals for whom it remained a social hangout. It was still in business in 1980 when its National Register documentation was prepared, but it has since closed.

It provides an alternative type of respiration to mitochondrial electron transport under the conditions of limited oxygen supply. Phytoglobin in hypoxic plants acts as part of a soluble terminal nitric oxide dioxygenase system, yielding nitrate ion from the reaction of oxygenated phytoglobin with NO. Class 1 phytoglobins are induced in plants under hypoxia, bind oxygen very tightly at nanomolar concentrations, and can effectively scavenge NO at oxygen levels far below the saturation of cytochrome c oxidase. In the course of the reaction, phytoglobin is oxidized to metphytoglobin which has to be reduced for continuous operation of the cycle. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase, while NO is mainly formed due to anaerobic reduction of nitrite which may take place in mitochondria by complex III and complex IV in the absence of oxygen, in the side reaction of nitrate reductase, or by electron transport proteins on the plasma membrane. The overall reaction sequence of the cycle consumes NADH and can contribute to the maintenance of ATP level in highly hypoxic conditions.

Kaminsky studied Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she received her Ph.D. In 1984 she did a brief research stay at the Argentine Central Bank, later in 1985 she moved to San Diego as an assistant professor at the University of California. In 1992 she worked on the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, later in 1998 she was appointed a full professor at George Washington University where she works at the Elliot School of International Affairs. Kaminsky has been a visiting scholar at the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Spain, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Central Bank of France. Kaminsky‚Äôs research focuses on contagion, currency and financial crises, exchange rates, fiscal and monetary policies, international capital flows as well as sovereign debt crises. She has published numerous academic journals including the American Economic Review, the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Journal of Development Economics, Journal of Monetary Economics and the Journal of International Economics. Furthermore, her research has been highlighted in the financial media such as Business Week, The Financial Times and The Economist.  Research in fiscal and monetary policy  One of Kaminsky‚Äôs first publications was ‚ÄúIs there a Peso Problem? Evidence from the Dollar/Pound Exchange Rate‚Äù published for the American Economic Review in 1994 and explores whether exchange rate forecasts are rational. She notes that investors can be rational and yet make repeated mistakes if the true model of the exchange rate evolved over time. Kaminsky concludes that exchange rate process has been evolving over time, capturing the changing regimes in the market fundamentals. In 1996, alongside Karen K. Lewis, Kaminsky published, \\"Does foreign exchange intervention signal future monetary policy?\\" which seeks to empirically examine the effects of foreign exchange intervention on the exchange rate. Two years later Kaminsky wrote \\"High Real Interest Rates in the Aftermath of Disinflation: Is it a Lack of Credibility\\" co-authored with Leonardo Leiderman and examines whether the lack of credibility of investors who assumed the stabilization programs in Argentina, Israel and Mexico in the mid-1980s are to blame for the high real interest rates in the months after the launch of the program. In 2004 alongside Carmen M. Reinhart and Carlos A. Vegh they published \\"When it Rains, it Pours: Procyclical Capital Flows and Macroeconomic Policies\\" for the National Bureau of Economic Research. They document the capital flows, fiscal policy and monetary policy based on a sample of 104 countries. They claim that net capital inflows, fiscal policy and monetary policy appear to be procyclical for the majority of developing countries. Furthermore, periods of capital inflows are associated with expansionary macroeconomic policies and periods of capital outflows with contractionary policies in developing countries with emerging markets. In 2010 in \\"Terms of Trade Shocks and Fiscal Cycles\\", Kaminsky examined the links between fiscal policy and terms of trade fluctuation using a sample of 74 countries both from developing and developed backgrounds. She concludes that booms in the terms of trade do not necessarily lead to larger government surpluses in developing countries, especially in emerging markets. However, this is not the case in OECD countries, where fiscal policy is of a unique nature. In February 2016 Alongside Pablo Vega-Garc√≠a she did an extensive research analyzing sovereign debt defaults from years 1820 to the Great Depression with a special focus on Latin America titled, \\"Systematic and Idiosyncratic Sovereign Debt Crises\\". They found that 63% of the crises were of a systematic nature. What these crises had in common were the international collapse of liquidity and the growth slowdown in the financial centers. In December of 2016 she published \\"Globalization in the Periphery: Monetary Policy: What is Gained, What is Lost\\" which focuses on the general misconceptions of globalization. She presents evidence that indicates that globalization has brought on better institutions and policies in developing countries. She notes that monetary policies in developing countries are now less ties to financing fiscal deficits and inflation.  Research in currency and financial crises  Written for the Journal of Development Economics in 1996, \\"The Debt Crises: Lessons of the 1980s for the 1990s\\" by Kaminsky and Alfredo Pereira underlines the growth collapse of the Latin American debtor countries. Both academics seek to prove the popular claims that the debt crises is the main reason for the growth collapse in these countries. They found that once they accounted for social inequality on government policy and consumption, the burden of servicing the debt becomes an important factor in explaining the overall investment and economic growth in Latin America. In March 1998, Kaminsky wrote \\"Leading Indicators of Currency Crises\\" alongside Saul Lizondo and Carmen M Reinhart examining the evidence on currency crises. More specifically, the authors propose an early warning system which involves monitoring the evolution of indicators that tend to exhibit a systematic behavior in the periods where a crisis soon follows. The main indicators identified in the paper are the behaviour of international reserves, real exchange rates, domestic credit, credit to the public sector and domestic inflation. Furthermore, if any of these indicators is offset, the probability of a crises occurring is probable within the following 24 months of the indicators issuing a signal. Similarly, Kaminsky and Carmen M. Reinhart wrote \\"Financial Crises in Asian and Latin America: Then and Now\\" comparing the economies of both regions from the 1970s-1990s. Both authors also wrote \\"The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payments Problem\\" and analyzed the links between banking and currency crises. They find that a banking crises tends to precede a currency crises ‚Äì this currency crises worsens the banking crises which in turn creates a vicious spiral. The authors find that crises occur as the economy enters into a recession, after booming economic activity that was fueled by credit, capital inflows and an overvalued currency. Kaminsky does a thorough analysis of the crisis in Asia in \\"What Triggers Market Jitters: A Chronicle of the Asian Crisis\\" and what type of news moves the economy into a market jitter. Kaminsky found that local and neighbour-country news and their updates regarding international agreements have a substantial effect. In 2000, Graciela Kaminsky and Carmen M. Reinhart published \\"On Crises, Contagion and Confusion\\" in the Journal of International Economics and they assess through which channels the crises spread by assessing both trade and financial links. In 2001 Kaminsky proposed a new approach to examine the behaviour of international integration of financial markets in \\"Short- and Long Run Integration: Do Capital Control Matter\\". Kaminsky found markets seem to be linked at longer rather than short run integration of economies with world financial markets. She found little evidence that capital controls do in fact insulate domestic markets from global spillovers. \\"Financial Markets in Times of Stress\\" was published in 2002 for the Journal of Development Economics alongside Carmen M. Reinhart. Both authors examined which markets are most synchronized internationally and exhibit the greater extent of co-movement. The focus on asset markets such as; bonds, equities, foreign exchange, and domestic money market. The research seek to analyze which markets show evidence of co-movement irrespective of whether there are adverse shocks or not. Similar to this research is Kaminsky‚Äôs paper for the Journal of International Money and Finance in 2006 titled, \\"Currency Crises: Are they all the Same?\\". In 2007 Kaminsky and Marco Cipriani published \\"Volatility in International Financial Market Issuance: The Role of the Financial Center\\" for the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research. Together they studied the pattern of volatility of gross issuance in international capital markets since the 1980s. They found short episodes of high volatility however this declines on the long run suggesting that international financial integration has not made financial markets more erratic.

Overview ORCI is a cancer treatment, research, and teaching center, affiliated with the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and with Muhimbili National Hospital, the teaching hospital of the university. ORCI maintains an inpatient facility with capacity of 256 beds. In Tanzania, an estimated 35,000 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2014, of whom about 21,000 (60 percent) died, the same year. The country has only two cancer hospitals, with the main one, ORCI, located in the capital, Dar es Salaam. Approximately 150 outpatients are attended to at ORCI, on a daily basis. At the institute, it is estimated that about 90 percent of the patients arrive when it's too late for a cure. History This health facility was founded in 1895 by the German colonial government. In the beginning, the hospital catered exclusively for German community. After the First World War, the British Colonial government reserved the hospital for serving the European communities. After independence in 1961, the hospital was renamed the Ocean Road Hospital, and all racial restrictions were removed. Ocean Road Hospital became the maternity wing of Muhimbili Medical Centre. In 1980, the facility was converted into a cancer treatment unit. The Radiotherapy Unit of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Dar es Salaam was shifted from Muhimbili Medical Centre to the Ocean Road Hospital. In June 1996, Ocean Road Hospital was made an independent autonomous institute directly under the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and its name changed to Ocean Road Cancer Institute.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999page=17 Hiking trails in the area include the Patterson Mountain Trail with good views of surrounding mountains from a 2250-foot ridge top. The area is part of the Craig Creek Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 24 miles north of Roanoke, Virginia. It is between Va 817 on the west and Va 655 and Va 666 on the east. Trails into the area include: *Patterson Mountain, Forest Service Trail 148, 5.5 miles *Tucker, FS 191, 0.85 miles *Helms, FS 181, 1.1 miles *Elmore, FS 151, 1.56 miles Boundary of the Patterson Mountain wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Patterson Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Oriskany and Strom. Natural history Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. The area has been the source of numerous sitings of the orangefin madtom. The area contains part of the Central Appalachian Shale Barrens where the rare Virginia white-haired leatherflower is found Several rare shale barrens biological communities are found here. They include the County Line Barrens and Little Patterson special biological areas along Little Patterson Creek, and the Horton Barren and Patterson Mountain Barren special biological areas found along Craig Creek. The rare butternut tree has been found in one of the area's drainages. Topography The area is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section, with rock types dominated by sandstone in the upper slopes and ridge tops, and shale and limestone in the bedrock on lower slopes. With a ridgetop extending along the area and many sideslope drainages, Patterson Mountain dominates the area. From a high elevation of 2260 feet at a crest of the mountain, the elevation dips to 1133 feet at the beginning of the Elmore Trail on Forest Rod 184. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Patterson Mountain was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. A 2009 study concluded that annual maintenance in the area was not keeping up with continual degradation leading to gullied trails, sediment in stream channels and unlawful use in sensitive riparian habitat. The adjacent Patterson Mountain Off-Highway Vehicle Trail system was closed pending an agency review. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. A large part of the area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry-Non Motorized‚Äù. An area along Patterson Creek is designated ‚ÄúMix of Successional Habitats‚Äù and there is a small area designated as ‚ÄúRare Community‚Äù.

The Fellowship of Friends is registered as a 501(c)(3) California non-profit church organization and is a member of the International Council of Community Churches (ICCC).http://livingpresence.com/fellowship-of-friends/  Doctrines of the Fellowship of Friends  A recently published book \\"Fifty Years with Angels\\" (first edition, December 2017), summarizes the history of the organization and expounds the current thinking as of that date. Robert Burton considers one of his roles is as a conduit for teaching communicated to him by beings he calls angels, who are the immortal spirits of men who have achieved awakening and specifically assist the Fellowship of Friends in its mission. This mission is twofold: to create the seed of a new civilization after the catastrophic doom that Burton has predicted since the early days of the organization, though the dates have been changed as each prediction has not been fulfilled, and to create consciousness in the members of the organization.  Renaissance Vineyard and Winery  From 1982 to 2015 the organization operated Renaissance Vineyard and Winery at the Apollo settlement. The vineyard was planted with advice from viticultural consultant Karl Werner, who married a Fellowship of Friends member and became a member himself. The Fellowship obtained designation of the North Yuba American Viticultural Area in 1985.  Criticism  A number of former members have sued Robert Earl Burton, the founder of the organization, for alleged sexual abuse. He has also been criticized for having a lavish lifestyle and for false prophecies. In 2006 an attendee at a Fellowship of Friends prospective student meeting wrote a report of his experience and posted it on a Wordpress site.https://animamrecro.wordpress.com/2006/04/16/fellowship-of-friends-a- cult-for-intellectuals/ This became a focus for many former members to air their views, and led to a lively discussion of the practices of the organisation and its founder.

In 1786, he obtained a travel grant from Fonden ad usus publicos and spent several years at German universities.

If S is a finite set of non-negative integers on which no three elements form an arithmetic progression (that is, a Salem‚ÄìSpencer set), then the Stanley sequence generated from S starts from the elements of S, in sorted order, and then repeatedly chooses each successive element of the sequence to be a number that is larger than the already-chosen numbers and does not form any three-term arithmetic progression with them. These sequences are named after Richard P. Stanley. Binary‚Äìternary sequence The Stanley sequence starting from the empty set consists of those numbers whose ternary representations have only the digits 0 and 1. That is, when written in ternary, they look like binary numbers. These numbers are :0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, ... By their construction as a Stanley sequence, this sequence is the lexicographically first arithmetic-progression- free sequence. Its elements are the sums of distinct powers of three, the numbers n such that the nth central binomial coefficient is 1 mod 3, and the numbers whose balanced ternary representation is the same as their ternary representation. The construction of this sequence from the ternary numbers is analogous to the construction of the Moser‚Äìde Bruijn sequence, the sequence of numbers whose base-4 representations have only the digits 0 and 1, and the construction of the Cantor set as the subset of real numbers in the interval [0,1] whose ternary representations use only the digits 0 and 2. More generally, they are a 2-regular sequence, one of a class of integer sequences defined by a linear recurrence relation with multiplier 2. This sequence includes three powers of two: 1, 4, and 256 = 35 \\\\+ 32 \\\\+ 3 + 1. Paul Erd≈ës conjectured that these are the only powers of two that it contains. Growth rate Andrew Odlyzko and Richard P. Stanley observed that the number of elements up to some threshold n in the binary‚Äìternary sequence, and in other Stanley sequences starting from \\\\\\\\{0,3^k\\\\\\\\} or \\\\\\\\{0,2\\\\cdot 3^k\\\\\\\\}, grows proportionally to n^{\\\\log_2 3}\\\\approx n^{0.631}. For other starting sets \\\\\\\\{0,s\\\\\\\\} the Stanley sequences that they considered appeared to grow more erratically but even more sparsely. For instance, the first irregular case is s=4, which generates the sequence :0, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 16, 23, 26, 31, 33, 37, 38, 44, 49, 56, 73, 78, 80, 85, 95, 99, ... Odlyzko and Stanley conjectured that in such cases the number of elements up to any threshold n is O\\\\bigl(\\\\sqrt{n\\\\log n}\\\\bigr). That is, there is a dichotomy in the growth rate of Stanley sequences between the ones with similar growth to the binary‚Äìternary sequence and others with a much smaller growth rate; according to this conjecture, there should be no Stanley sequences with intermediate growth. Moy proved that Stanley sequences cannot grow significantly more slowly than the conjectured bound for the sequences of slow growth. Every Stanley sequence has \\\\Omega\\\\bigl(\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\bigr) elements up to n. More precisely Moy showed that, for every such sequence, every \\\\varepsilon>0, and all sufficiently large n, the number of elements is at least (\\\\sqrt 2 - \\\\varepsilon)\\\\sqrt n. Later authors improved the constant factor in this bound, and proved that for Stanley sequences that grow as n^{\\\\log_2 3} the constant factor in their growth rates can be any rational number whose denominator is a power of three. History A variation of the binary‚Äìternary sequence (with one added to each element) was considered in 1936 by Paul Erd≈ës and P√°l Tur√°n, who observed that it has no three-term arithmetic progression and conjectured (incorrectly) that it was the densest possible sequence with no arithmetic progression. In unpublished work with Andrew Odlyzko in 1978, Richard P. Stanley experimented with the greedy algorithm to generate progression-free sequences. The sequences they studied were exactly the Stanley sequences for the initial sets \\\\\\\\{0,s\\\\\\\\}. Stanley sequences were named, and generalized to other starting sets than \\\\\\\\{0,s\\\\\\\\}, in a paper published in 1999 by Erd≈ës (posthumously) with four other authors.

It was created to help teach the basic language to children and young adults throughout Albania and the surrounding region where Albanians live. Abetare has played a significant role in the history of Albanian education and laid the groundwork for literary Albanian which helped raise the national consciousness for future generations. By learning to read and write, young Albanians were introduced to the history and culture of their homeland. History The first alphabet book of the Albanian language titled \\"The very brief and useful Albanian Evetar\\" was written in 1844 by prominent author of the National Revival period Naum Veqilharxhi. Since that time, more than 150 revised iterations of the Abetare have been printed in Albania and abroad. Veqilharxhi's work was followed by Kostandin Kristoforidhi, another prominent figure of the National Revival period who in 1867 published his own version of the Abetare in both gheg and tosk. Three decades later, on February 27, 1897 in Istanbul, the \\"Alphabet of the Albanian Language\\" was published at the initiative of Sami Frash√´ri, Jani Vreto, Vaso Pasha and Koto Hoxhi, all intellectuals who had founded the Print Society of Albanian Letters. The drafting of future textbooks of Abetare passed along to other renowned academics like Luigj Gurakuqi, Parashqevi Qiriazi, Nikolla Lako, Simon Shuteriqi and in later years followed by Aleksand√´r Xhuvani, Thoma Papapano, Mati Logoreci, Jani Minga and others. In 1946, a more thorough scientific iteration of the Abetare was drafted by author Kol√´ Xhumari. It was to become the official government approved textbook that was distributed to elementary schools and kindergartens in the country in the next five decades. After concerns over the quality of education in areas outside Albania, the most common Abetare are now unified between Albania and Kosovo, and regional editions have been updated. The modern Abetare teaches children the alphabet and the syllables of Albanian, mostly through reading. It also focuses on [cursive] writing (shkrim dore) and basic sentence formation.

Honorees left handprints and other personal markings along with written messages in the cement in the manner of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. At its opening, it was touted as \\"the country music equivalent to the Hollywood Walk of Fame\\".  Background  The StarWalk project was a joint venture of the Fountain Square entertainment district and the Nashville branch of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. Fountain Square was a large area developed for business, shopping, and entertainment by Aladdin Resources Inc. The cement plaques formed a low wall running along a scenic lakeside pedestrian path. Each plaque was framed in brass, measured 3'√ó6', and weighed 700 pounds.  Honorees  An announcement gala was held on January 27, 1987 to promote the project and reveal the first 10 inductees: Alabama, Chet Atkins, the Charlie Daniels Band, Crystal Gayle, Loretta Lynn, Ronnie Milsap, the Oak Ridge Boys, Jerry Reed, Conway Twitty, and Dottie West. The inaugural ceremony in August 1987 brought the number up to a total of 50, and most of them arrived in person to leave their marks. Beyond the 10 previously announced, inductees included Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, Tammy Wynette, Wynonna and Naomi Judd, Lynn Anderson, and Ricky Skaggs. The developers planned to induct five past or future Grammy winners every year. The original wall had room for 150 commemorative plaques, and space had been set aside for expansion. Later inductees included Dolly Parton (1988), Jeannie C. Riley (1989), the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (1990), Garth Brooks (1992), Emmylou Harris (1993), Brooks & Dunn, and Earl and Randy Scruggs (1997).  Later years  By the early 1990s, the StarWalk had been transferred to a new home at Opryland theme park. After that venue closed in December 1997, the plaques were moved to locations outside the Grand Ole Opry House.

It was founded in 1893 by Uryu Iwako and is still in operation today.  Post Fukushima Disaster  After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, many orphanages were left to manage on their own. Fukushima Aiikuen, located 49 miles away from the plant, was outside of the official evacuation zone. While the prefectural government paid for a clean-up of the grounds as well as a device for testing the radiation levels of food and a staff member to operate it, the orphanage had to rely on outside assistance for other aid such as uncontaminated food, monitoring of radiation exposure, and trips outside of the prefecture. As of March 2013, though certain surfaces have met the target level of radiation, some hot spots still reached 50 times the official safe amount. As a result, the orphanage's director, Hisao Saito, instituted several measures to limit the children's exposure. Routine health checks were performed for each child, which recorded not only general health data but also radiation exposure level. Outdoor playtime was greatly reduced for older children and eliminated for younger ones. Food was checked daily for contamination.  Fukushima Youth Cultural Exchange Program  In 2013, the Japan-America Society of Southern California sponsored a program to bring children from various orphanages affected by the Fukushima Disaster to the United States. The purpose of the program was to both encourage cultural exchange between Japan and the US as well as offer the children time away from the radiation and rebuilding of their homes. During the roughly week-long visits, the middle- and high-school children stay with an American host family and experience various aspects of American culture. The first official visit was commemorated with a cherry tree dedication ceremony in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, where three of the trees were named by the Aiikuen children. The program was discontinued in 2017, as the Japanese government's increasing use of the fostering system greatly reduced the number of children in participating orphanages, including Fukushima Aiikuen.

It was established in 1911 from the merger of the Linden Reporter and the Marengo Democrat. The newspaper was published by the Sutton family for over a century, with Goodloe Sutton running it from 1985 to 2019. The newspaper won national acclaim in the 1990s for its investigation of a corrupt county sheriff, but was met with criticism in early 2019 over an editorial from Sutton calling for the return of the Ku Klux Klan. Sutton resigned as publisher and editor on February 22, 2019, and appointed Elecia R. Dexter to the two roles while he retained ownership. Dexter resigned less than a month later, citing ongoing interference from Sutton, and a deal to sell the paper to an out-of-state couple fell through a month later. The newspaper was sold to Tommy Wells in July 2019, as Sutton announced his retirement. History The Linden Reporter was created in 1879 and the Marengo Democrat was founded in 1899. The two newspapers merged to form The Democrat-Reporter in 1911. Robert E. Sutton bought the newspaper in 1917 and was its managing editor and publisher until 1965. He sold The Democrat-Reporter to his son Goodloe in 1982. Goodloe Sutton also worked alongside his wife, Jean, until her death in 2003. The newspaper won national acclaim in the 1990s for its investigation of county sheriff Roger Davis for political corruption, despite his widespread popularity and death threats to editor Goodloe Sutton and his family. Davis and two deputies from the office were sentenced for misuse of public funds and other crimes, including intimidation tactics used against the Suttons. The four-year investigative series was considered a favorite for a Pulitzer Prize nomination in 1998, though the newspaper was not a finalist. The Suttons were interviewed by The New York Times, the American Journalism Review, Readers Digest, and the Oprah Winfrey Show. Goodloe Sutton was also honored by Representative Earl F. Hilliard in a remark to Congress on May 6, 1998, for his bravery. Goodloe Sutton ran unsuccessfully for the state house in 1998, losing to incumbent Andrew Hayden despite an ethics controversy. The Democrat- Reporter had a longstanding rivalry with the Demopolis Times, which is published in neighboring Demopolis. The Democrat-Reporter absorbed the Thomasville News (of Thomasville) in 2006, after a decade under the ownership of the Sutton family. The newspaper's circulation dropped from 7,000 to 3,000 by the mid-2010s, and printing was outsourced to a plant in Monroeville. The offices for The Democrat-Reporter were moved in 2015 to a new building farther away from the county courthouse. The newspaper is published weekly on Thursdays and generally contains eight pages, including local news, legal notices, and an editorial page. =KKK editorial and new ownership= On February 14, 2019, The Democrat-Reporter publisher Goodloe Sutton wrote an editorial titled \\"Klan needs to ride again\\", calling for the return of the Ku Klux Klan to \\"clean out Washington D.C.\\" with lynchings. \\"We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them\\", Sutton said. He also specified that he was only referring to hanging \\"socialist-communists\\", and compared the Klan to the NAACP. The editorial led to calls on Sutton to resign by senators Doug Jones and Richard Shelby, while other local politicians stated that they were not surprised by the comments. The editorial was first discovered and shared by the student-run Auburn Plainsman. Sutton had previously been criticized for running offensive headlines and editorials, including comments about the Obama family and Hillary Clinton, but they did not get as much attention. Subscriptions to the newspaper declined as Linden residents responded negatively to the editorial and its widespread attention. Sutton's alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi, removed him from the School of Communication's Mass Communication Hall of Fame over the editorial, and he was also stripped of a distinguished community journalism award he had been presented in 2009 by Auburn University's Journalism Advisory Council. Sutton responded to the criticism by saying that he was not sorry that he wrote the editorial, and that he would do it again if he had the chance. On February 22, Sutton announced that he would resign from his positions as publisher and editor, giving control of the newspaper to Elecia R. Dexter. Dexter, an African-American woman with a degree in speech communications from Eastern Illinois University, had been employed at The Democrat-Reporter as a front-desk employee for six weeks at the time of the editorial, but had no journalism experience. Sutton retained ownership of the newspaper. Dexter resigned the editorship on March 11, two weeks after taking the position, due to editorial changes made by Sutton without her permission. In an interview with The New York Times, Dexter said that Sutton had emailed a version of the February 28 issue of the newspaper that replaced an article about his retirement with a defense of the KKK editorial and attacks against the Montgomery Advertiser for publishing an interview with him. She stated that her resignation was made after further changes to the March 14 issue, but was delayed over concerns for Sutton's cognitive well-being. The Associated Press reported in late March that Sutton had sold the newspaper to an unnamed buyer, who were later identified as out-of-state residents C.T. Harless and Sabrina McMahan in a front-page editorial on March 28. Online news outlet Alabama Political Reporter published an investigation into Harless, who was using a pseudonym, and linked him to a group aligned with the Ku Klux Klan from Tennessee. Linden mayor Charles Moore expressed skepticism over whether the newspaper had actually been sold, while Sutton stated that he would continue operating the newspaper because the new owners lacked experience. In July, the Associated Press reported that Sutton had retired and sold the newspaper to Tommy Wells, a sports publicist from Texas who had previously shown interest in acquiring the Democrat-Reporter. Wells and his wife published their first edition on July 5, 2019, with the announcement of Sutton's retirement.

Influenced by the growing Indonesian nationalist movement, it proposed a third way beyond the pro-China and pro-Dutch parties which had existed among the Indonesian Chinese until then. The PTI advocated for Indonesian citizenship for Chinese Indonesians and closer political ties to Indigenous Indonesians (pribumi or bumiputera). The party was created in September 1932 as a result of the dispute over whether Chinese Indonesians should aspire to Dutch citizenship or whether they should remain citizens of the Republic of China.Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. This debate had been going on since the birth of the Chinese republic in 1911. As well, the drive to found the PTI came from the lower classes of Indies Chinese who felt excluded from politics.Govaars-Tjia, Ming Tien Nio. Dutch colonial education: the Chinese experience in Indonesia, 1900‚Äì1942. Chinese Heritage Centre, 2005. By the 1930s Peranakan Chinese politics in the Dutch East Indies were dominated by the Chung Hwa Hui, a rightwing political party seen as a mouthpiece of the pro-Dutch and conservative colonial Chinese establishment.Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. The party's leaders, H. H. Kan and Loa Sek Hie, advocated cooperation with, and participation in, the Dutch colonial state.Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. The Sin Po faction, which advocated allegiance to mainland China, wanted to stay out of Indies politics altogether. However, a small faction in the late 1920s and early 1930s led by Liem Koen Hian, editor of the papers Sin Tit Po and Soeara Publiek, influenced by the Indische Partij, advocated for Indisch Burderschap (Dutch: Indies citizenship) for the Indies Chinese. By 1932 he was calling it Indonesi√´rschap (Dutch: Indonesian citizenship).Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. So, in 1932 Liem along with Kwee Thiam Tjing, Ong Liang Kok and other Surabaya Peranakan Chinese founded the PTI with the support of some moderate Indonesian nationalists such as Soetomo and Suroso. Their platform aspired to reform the Dutch East Indies to the point where there was racial equality between the Dutch, Pribumi and Indonesian Chinese. However, like the Chung Hwa Hui they excluded Totok Chinese (foreign-born Chinese) from voting rights in the party.Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. In 1934, the Leiden-educated lawyer Ko Kwat Tiong, hitherto chairman of the PTI's Semarang branch, was voted to succeed Liem as president of the entire party. The PTI elected Ko, its only member to the Volksraad in the 1935 election. Ko opened up the PTI to Totok Chinese members, and as the party's representative in the Volksraad, was one of the six initiators and signatories of the Soetardjo Petition of 1936, which requested Indonesian independence as part of a Dutch commonwealth. Liem Koen Hian had a falling out with his Indonesian nationalist ally Dr. Sutomo in 1936 after the later visited Japan and praised its government. As a Chinese nationalist, Liem accused Sutomo of spreading Japanese propaganda.Lohanda, Mona. Growing pains: The Chinese and the Dutch in colonial Java, 1890‚Äì1942. Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka, 2002. A personality clash between Liem and Ko Kwat Tiong also arose, causing Liem to leave the PTI in 1939 for the Gerindo party. With the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in 1942, the party essentially ended and was not recreated after Indonesian independence in 1949.

It is a concept album about \\"the search for identity, significance and purpose within the overarching meaninglessness of life.\\"  Background and promotion  After releasing the EP Canvas of Silence and touring in order to promote it, the band started to look for a label via which they could release the album. On May 2017, the band released their first music video for \\"Merchant of Dreams\\". Also in 2017, the band mentioned a future debut album by the name of The Anthropic Conceit and which was expected to be funded by a campaign on Fuel a Dream and then succeeded by a tour. By 2018, however, the album was being promoted with the new and final title of Insignify. On 1 October 2018, they released the video of \\"Suicide Note\\", a song inspired by a verse by Agha Shahid Ali (\\"I could not simplify myself.\\") and expressing \\"a desperate need to be understood while contemplating suicide, an irony because perhaps that need signifies that all hope isn't lost yet.\\" On November 6, the eve of the album's release, the band made it wholly available for listening on YouTube. On December 5, the band released a lyric video for \\"Within\\", a track based on Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha. It features additional vocals from singer and podcast host Vidyaa Prakash and is considered a shifting point in the album, returning to the brighter sound of the album's first couple of songs, since it marks the point in the plot in which the protagonist has found \\"some semblance of inner peace\\".  Concept  Inspiration for the album came from a lot of different sources that vocalist and guitarist Vats Iyengar read before production. He said the album is about the significance of life from the point of view of an artist (more precisely a musician) and deals with themes such as existentialism, narcissism, craving importance, insecurity and the search for reason. Iyengar, the main songwriter, wanted the album to \\"happen in an organic way\\". Apart from Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation and Hindustani classical music, Johann Sebastian Bach is also an influence on the album, specifically on the track \\"Purpose\\", composed as a fugue. = Title = The band officially defines the album title as follows:  Reception  Insignify was elected one of the best 2018 Indian albums by Rolling Stone India. David Britto wrote > [...] it doesn't take long to hear the band's diversity and exponential > dynamics come through.

Beach was known for changing his recipes over time, and multiple versions of the Test Pilot attributed to both him and others make the cocktail one of his more frequently imitated and varied tiki drinks. Test Pilot recipes call for multiple rums and typically include the use of falernum syrup and lime juice. The more popular also include Pernod (pastis/absinthe) and bitters. Test Pilot versions A recipe from a Don the Beachcomber drink guide calls for 1 oz of Lemon Hart Demerara 151 proof rum and 3/4 oz each of Jamaican dark rum, Puerto Rican dark rum, lime juice, grape juice, and honey. Two dashes each of bitters and grenadine should also be added, then flash blended with cracked ice and served in a double old fashioned glass. The date of the recipe's origin and when and where it was served is not mentioned. Another version that Jeff Berry attributes to Donn Beach from circa 1941 while less strong is still very potent and calls for 1 1/2 oz of Jamaican dark rum, 3/4 oz of Puerto Rican light rum, 3 teaspoons of Cointreau, 1/8 a teaspoon of Pernod, a 1/2 oz of both lime juice and falernum syrup, and a dash of bitters. The use of Pernod and bitters was employed by Beach as one of his signature combinations, and some cocktail enthusiasts feel it is a pivotal part of the recipe. Several additional cocktail recipe references choose to highlight this version. A Trader Vic Test Pilot version listed in his 1972 revised drink guide switches the lime juice for lemon and jettisons the Pernod and bitters, calling only for 1 3/4 oz dark Jamaican rum, 3/4 oz light Puerto Rican rum, 1/4 oz of Cointreau, 1/4 oz falernum, and 1/4 oz lemon juice. Difford's Guide chose to highlight the Trader Vic's version. The Jet Pilot Some Beachcomber and Trader Vic competitors named their versions as the Jet Pilot, including at The Luau restaurant and the Mai-Kai. The Jet Pilot was similar to Beach's 1941 version but was slightly spicier with the addition of stronger rum, grapefruit juice, and cinnamon syrup. Impact on tiki culture Beyond the Jet Pilot, other aviation themed tiki cocktails include the similarly named Ace Pilot, Don Beach's Q.B. Cooler, and Trader Vic's PB2Y (named after the Navy's Coronado plane). A tiki bar named Test Pilot operates in Santa Barbara, California that serves a Test Pilot cocktail, described as having a flavor profile of \\"house rum blend, clove, citrus, bitters, [and] absinthe foam\\".

She was the mother of the American war hero Douglas Albert Munro and the sister of the Canadian parliamentarian Francis Fairey. Early life Munro was born in Liverpool, England; after the death of her father, her mother moved the family to British Columbia, Canada, to be closer to other relatives. Among her brothers was Francis Fairey, who would later command the Irish Fusiliers of Canada and represent Victoria, British Columbia, in the House of Commons of Canada. She married American expatriate James Munro in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1914 and later had two children by him, Douglas Albert and Patricia Edith. In 1922, James Munro repatriated his family to the United States, ultimately settling in South Cle Elum, Washington. Military career Edith Munro spent her life as a homemaker until the age of 48 when she joined the United States Coast Guard Women's Reserve after her son, who had been serving as a signalman with the United States Coast Guard, was killed in action in the Second Battle of the Matanikau in 1942. She decided by volunteering for military service she would be honoring his legacy. She eventually commanded the Coast Guard barracks in Seattle. In May 1943, Munro was presented with her son's Medal of Honor by President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt in a White House ceremony. She was the sponsor of two of the three United States warships named after her son, the destroyer and the cutter . Munro did not want her son's remains to be interred at Arlington National Cemetery because she would be unable to attend to his grave. Instead they were buried at the Laurel Hill Memorial Park in Cle Elum, Washington. Following her own death, Munro was buried to the left of her son with military honors.

Nattiv's full-length feature Skin, also released in 2018, is not related to this film in terms of their narratives. Plot A family goes to a lake with friends. Their tattoos imply the group are Neo-Nazis. Jeffrey (Jonathan Tucker) brags that his son, Troy (Jackson Robert Scott) can shoot a target with a rifle and takes bets on the challenge. Troy successfully shoots the target. The group heads to a grocery store, where Christa (Danielle Macdonald) shops for food. In the checkout line, Troy sees an African-American man, Jaydee (Ashley Thomas), holding a toy. Troy and the man smile at each other. As Jaydee is checking out, Jeffrey notices the interaction and accuses Jaydee of messing with his boy. Jaydee denies it and Jeffrey calls him a racial slur. Jaydee leaves, telling Jeffrey that he is the problem. Jeffrey tells his friends about the dispute and they follow Jaydee into the parking lot. Jeffrey and his friends beat Jaydee viciously while Jaydee's wife calls the police from her car nearby. Troy watches the incident from the store as Christa frets. As the group leaves, Jaydee's wife holds him in the parking lot. Troy looks out the car window and makes eye contact with Jaydee's son, Bronny (Lonnie Chavis), who is nearly the same age. The next evening, Jeffrey and Troy are driving home and find a van blocking the road. Jeffrey walks up to the van and a group of black men abduct him. Jeffrey is taken to the garage of a home, where several black men and Bronny drug and tattoo him over several days. Jaydee is there recovering. Some time later, Jeffrey is thrown naked onto the same road he was abducted from. He sees his reflection in a window and finds his skin tattooed completely black. Inside their home, Christa wakes up to the sound of someone outside. She loads a handgun and calls for help. Jeffrey attempts to wash his skin clean with water but fails. Christa orders Troy to hide under the bed and not come out. Jeffrey forcefully enters the home. Christa, seeing what appears to be a naked, black man in her home, warns him to get out or she will shoot him. Jeffrey manages to communicate to Christa who he is, and she drops her weapon. A shot rings out, and Jeffrey collapses. Troy stands in the doorway behind Jeffrey holding a rifle.

The film received generally positive reviews from credits. , 83% of the six reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The film has also attracted social and political controversies. Stephen Dalton, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, remarked that Moura presents Marighella's character as a martyr for liberal values even though the real Marighella was a self-proclaimed far-left Marxist. Marighella's ethnicity was also debated. He is portrayed as black in the film and played by a black actor. Many critics noted, however, that Marighella was actually mixed-race (his father was an Italian immigrant). Moura responded that \\"there's no way to discuss any social issue in Brazil without talking about racial issues. For me, Marighella had to be black.\\" Several sources reported that internet bots were used to reduce the movie rating on the IMDb website. In response, IMDb deactivated ratings on the film's page.

The team was initially a collaboration between Tony Longhurst and Frank Gardner, with Terry Morris later joining as a shareholder, with their three names combining to create the LoGaMo name. The team is best known for winning the 1988 Bathurst 1000 with Longhurst and Tomas Mezera. Background At the end of 1987 Frank Gardner closed his JPS Team BMW operation, having decided to retire after a period of ill health. Lead driver Jim Richards, who had won two championships for the team, and the BMW M3s moved to Peter Brock's Mobil 1 Racing team. For 1988, Tony Longhurst, who had raced the second JPS BMW M3, formed his own team on the Gold Coast, which was initially known as Tony Longhurst Racing. Frank Gardner was listed as a consultant to the new team, but as the 1988 season progressed, he assumed the team manager's role and would become a shareholder in the team. History =Freeport Motorsport= Going into 1988, the team entered a single Ford Sierra RS500 for Longhurst. However, over the previous off-season Gardner had led the successful protest against the factory-backed Eggenberger Motorsport Ford Sierras at the 1987 Bathurst 1000, which had ultimately cost the Ford the World Touring Car Championship. This made it difficult for the team to source components through Ford in Europe, with endurance co-driver Tomas Mezera who was based in London at the time, trying to source components. Longhurst would finish the championship in fifth position, finishing only four of the nine rounds, including a win at the Lakeside round after Dick Johnson was given a one- minute penalty for a false start. =Benson & Hedges Racing= From the Sandown 500 onwards, Amatil's Benson & Hedges brand was applied, Longhurst and Mezera going on to win the 1988 Bathurst 1000. It was the first Bathurst 1000 win for both drivers, and also the first for Gardner as team manager, who failed to win the race in his otherwise successful JPS Team BMW era. The winning car now resides in the National Motor Racing Museum near the circuit. In 1989, the team expanded to two cars with Neville Crichton driving a second Sierra. In 1990, Alan Jones replaced Crichton in the second car. In both years, Longhurst would again finish in the top six of the championship. In 1990, Gardner established a Performance Driving Centre at Norwell with the team's workshop incorporated.Introducing The Performance Driving Centre The Performance Driving Centre In 1991, Gardner rekindled his links to BMW and the team became the marque's factory team, acquiring a pair of ex Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M3s. Longhurst won two rounds at Amaroo Park and Lakeside and finished third in the championship. From 1989 to 1991, Longhurst also won three consecutive AMSCAR Series at Amaroo Park for the team. In 1992, Longhurst won a third round at Lakeside and again finished third in the championship. A third M3 was also entered at selected events in 1992 for Paul Morris whose father Terry would become a shareholder in the team, completing the triumvirate of owners to create the LoGaMo name. At the 1992 Bathurst 1000, Formula One world champion Denny Hulme suffered a heart attack and died while co-driving with Morris. In 1993, despite the championship's move towards a Ford versus Holden formula, the team expanded to field four M3s, with John Blanchard replacing Alan Jones in the second Benson & Hedges car, and Paul Morris and Geoff Full racing with Diet Coke sponsorship. By 1994, BMW was no longer eligible for the five-litre ATCC and LoGaMo committed to race in the 1994 Australian Manufacturers' Championship with a pair of two-litre BMW 320is. However, with the series at one stage in doubt, and a desire by sponsors to retain a presence in the country's main category, two Perkins Engineering built Holden Commodore VPs were purchased with Longhurst and Morris racing in both the two-litre and five-litre series. Longhurst won one race at the Barbagallo round but both him and Morris finished outside the top ten of the ATCC, with the team skipping the Phillip Island round entirely to focus on the Manufacturers' Championship. Meanwhile in the Manufacturers Championship, the team finished first second and third with their three entrants, with Longhurst taking the title. However, the year was perhaps best remembered for team-mates Longhurst and Morris colliding on the pit straight at Winton. Longhurst blamed Morris for the crash, which had put both cars into the concrete wall, and infamously punched Morris through Morris's driver's side window. Demise Heading into 1995, Longhurst wished to continue in the ATCC while Gardner and Morris wanted to stick with the two-litre Super Touring Championship. At the end of 1994, Gardner and Morris bought Longhurst out, with the latter forming Longhurst Racing to race a Ford Falcon EF in the 1995 ATCC season, a team which continued in the championship until 1999. Gardner continued with the Morris family to form Paul Morris Motorsport. Gardner retired soon after and sold the Performance Driving Centre in Norwell to Morris, who continues to use the facility as a base, including for a return to the ATCC (which had become known as V8 Supercars) from 2000 to 2012.

The main time period of occupation was the later Woodland. Evidence suggests that the location was the site of a seasonal camp, rather than a permanent village. The site was re-discovered in 1968 by a team of students from Michigan State University headed by Charles E. Leland. Leland did some initial excavation, removing some artifacts. Further investigation was undertaken by John Wilson on 1970. In 1973, a second team from MSU, headed by Joseph L.

Naval career John Malyn began his career as a private ship owner and seaman when he was based in Calais, France in 1540. In October 1544 his ships and hoys were hired to assist in the transportation of troops returning from the Sieges of Boulogne (1544‚Äì46). In August 1554 he was appointed Captain of HMS Falcon a pinnace and assigned to patrolling duties off the East Anglian coast. In September 1556 he was appointed under the command of Lord High Admiral of England Lord Effingham to escort Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to Spain. From November 1558 to January 1559 he was appointed Vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas and charged with protecting England's trade interests in the area. He took part in the Battle of Gravelines (1558) whilst commanding the Narrow Seas Squadron on approach to Calais he observed the French Army troop lines and maneuvered his ships close inshore, thus running the risk of beaching he then opened fire on them; his actions were personally noted in a letter from the Queen thanking him and granted him a pension.

The rivers Dubr√©ka and Dembia debouching into the bay are labelled Sangari, with the Los Islands marked as an area of British interest. Kapita√Ø and Koba (also known as Kabitai and Coba or Kobah) were two areas on the coast of West Africa which were the object of German colonial initiatives in 1884 and 1885. They lay between the Pongo and Dubr√©ka rivers, south of Senegal and Gambia in modern Guinea; in the terms commonly used in the 19th century they were considered part of Senegambia. The short-lived German colony there was known as the Dembiah colony or Colinsland (after its founder). Friedrich Colin‚Äôs business interests 1885 map of German possessions in Africa, with Kapita√Ø and Koba shown as Dubrica Detailed map of Lower Guinea with the settled areas of Baga and Sousou (late 19th century) The Stuttgart businessman had been trading in West Africa since 1870 on behalf a French company. In 1882, France claimed the region as part of its Rivi√®res du Sud territory, although it did not act to obtain effective control. As a result of this claim Colin broke away from his French partners and set up his own concern, although the ' declined to give him any support. In 1883 and 1884, with the support of his brother Ludwig, a director of the W√ºrttembergische Vereinsbank in Stuttgart, Colin established trading posts of his own in the unclaimed areas of Baga und Sousou and along the Dubreka river, including one at Bramaia, and signed agreements with the local rulers. In the same region there were also a French trading post and a British one, with German employees. At a meeting of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck with businessmen trading in Africa on April 28, 1884, Colin first called on the government to protect his possessions by annexing territory in Rivi√®res du Sud. On 9 March 1885, together with partners from Hamburg, Colin founded the firm Fr. Colin, Deutsch-Afrikanisches Gesch√§ft in Frankfurt am Main, to explore and develop trade with West Africa and in particular to reach the source of the Niger in the Fouta Djallon mountains. The founding capital was 600,000 marks of which 420,000 marks was directly subscribed in Frankfurt, with shares at a face value of 10,000 marks. Colin‚Äôs trading posts in Africa were brought under the new company. Through his brother, Colin was able to bring on board as partners and sponsors Prince , Count , Freiherr , the bankers and , as well as businessmen , , and . These names assured him of the goodwill of the Foreign Office. Establishing ‚ÄúColinsland‚Äù The landscape between Conakry and Kamsar, formerly Koba The land Colin was claiming consisted of five petty kingdoms Kapita√Ø, Koba, Bramaia, Dubr√©ka and Sumbuja, of which only the first two were eventually to come under Imperial protection. The hilly and wooded Kapita√Ø (also Capitay, Kapitay, Kabitai or Khabitaye) lay between the Dembiah and Dubr√©ka rivers around 400‚Äì500 metres above sea level. and covered around 1,650 km¬≤ in today‚Äôs Dubr√©ka Prefecture. The main town was Iatia (Yatiya). The smaller kingdom of Koba (Kobah) lay to the North on a plain between the Dembiah and Pongo Rivers, covering some 660 km¬≤ in modern Boffa Prefecture, with its main town at Taboria (Taboriya). At the time Koba was rich in palm, kola, nut and other trees. Kapita√Ø had rubber trees but was more noted for its iron ore, on account of which its local name translated as \\"land of the smiths\\". Both were suitable for the establishment of coffee or cotton plantations. Together, Kapita√Ø and Koba had around 30-40,000 inhabitants who were predominantly Muslim. Kapita√Ø comprise around 48 villages, Koba 45. Overseas trade was conducted mostly by barter, exchanging rubber and copal for cotton cloth, liquor, gunpowder and flintlocks. To the south, the kingdom of Sumbuja (also Sumbayland, Simbaya, Symbaya or Sumbujo) in the modern Coyah Prefecture, with its centre at Wonkifong, had been thrown into disorder in 1884 following the death of its ruler. Colin‚Äôs local agents , Eduard Schmidt and Johannes Voss signed an agreement with one of the pretenders to the throne, Mory Fode, on 11 July 1884, and on 13 July signed another with Alkali Bangali, ruler of Kapita√Ø. After signing an identical agreement with Allie Te Uri of Koba on 10 October 1884, Colin proposed in a letter to Bismarck on 12 October that the German Empire should assume the status of protector of these territories. King Bala Demba of Dubr√©ka, father of the king of Kapita√Ø also sent a letter, forwarded to Berlin by Colin, in which he asked Kaiser Wilhelm I to send traders and promised to protect them. The somewhat ambiguous agreements with King Mory and King Alkali each guaranteed, in return for an annual salary of $200 that Sumbuja and Kapita√Ø would not enter into agreements with other powers without the approval of Germany, and would leave trading arrangements to Colin. The royal families, their subjects and the whole countries were to be placed under German \\"protection\\", with disputes between Europeans and Africans governed by German law. Mory and Alkali were to make grants of land to Colin at no charge for the erection of roads, roads, bridges, railroads and German mission schools, and to provide the workers necessary for construction and maintenance. French claims and Nachtigal‚Äôs expedition European claims on the coast of West Africa in 1885. Rivi√®res du Sud, including Kapita√Ø and Koba were disputed by France and Germany. As early as 1880, French colonial agents from Senegal had been signing agreements with other chiefs and kings of the region. The French Government therefore laid claim to the entire territory between the Pongo River to the north and Sierra Leone in the south. France imposed customs duties on goods brought into the region from Europe and required health certificates and anchorage fees from visiting ships. In June 1884 the Imperial Commissioner for German West Africa (later Togo and Cameroon), Gustav Nachtigal, and his representative, arrived on board the warships SMS M√∂we and with the aim of testing the new German claims against those of France. Nachtigal presented Bala Demba with a reply from the German Emperor Wilhelm I and a gilded Renaissance sword as a gift. (Another gift, an iron equestrian statue of the Emperor, was not presented out of consideration for the proscription of images in Islam). However, the hoped-for conclusion of a treaty of protection did not take place. According to Buchner, Bala Demba was \\"apparently against writing\\". Nachtigal and Buchner therefore returned to their ships and steamed away. Alarmed by Colin's treaties and the presence of German warships, on 3 September 1884 France formally established a protectorate over the whole of Bramayaland (Bramiah, in today's Fria Prefecture) and extended its claims to the Fouta Djallon (source of the Niger, Senegal and Gambia Rivers). The Ariadne expedition King William Fernandez of Bramiah (front, second from right) with the future governor Jean-Marie Bayol in 1885 Unlike Nachtigal, who considered that French claims made conditions unsuitable for German colonial acquisitions in Senegambia or Guinea, Colin recognised no French rights and in October 1884 urged the government to send another warship to protect his possessions. The government made a commitment to do so in November 1884 and at the end of December 1884 the gunboat arrived at the mouth of the Dubr√©ka and placed the region under German protection. The Ariadne headed a short way up the rivers Dubr√©ka and Dembia at the end of December 1884. On January 1, 1885 a steam launch took Lieutenant Commander Ch√ºden, Lieutenant du Bois, Lieutenant Oppenheimer and five other Germans ashore. Like Colin, Ch√ºden did not consider the areas he was visiting to be French territory. The Bramiah king William Fernandez received Ch√ºden hospitably and was willing to cooperate, but said he had already signed agreements with France, most recently on September 4, 1884. Ch√ºden therefore abandoned the plan to raise the German flag there. The next day the Germans went on to Yatiya (Jatia) where Ch√ºden met on the king of Kapita√Ø, Alkali Bangali. On 2 January 1885 he finally had the German flag hoisted at Sangar√©a Bay in the presence of the King, the German officers and some sailors. Kapita√Ø was thenceforth considered the property of the house of F. Colin in Stuttgart. The king of Koba, Allie Te Uri, was opposed to French demands for cooperation and willingly agreed with the German representatives to raise the German flag in three of his villages between 4 and 6 January 1885. This raising of the flag was communicated to the neighboring French military post of Boffa. On 6 January 1885 Emperor Wilhelm I issued an official letter of protection for the Dubr√©ka and Dembia colonies. Colin agreed to pay the cost of building a German colonial administration, but this never happened. As a result of the West Africa Conference, France and Germany began to delineate their spheres of influence and spheres of influence as of February 1885. Bismarck‚Äôs aim was to weaken French revanchism and to encourage its colonial ambitions instead, which would have the effect of pitting France against England. Agreement with France After Nachtigal's death in April 1885 the German ambassador in Paris, Prince Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst, sought an understanding with France. Colin‚Äôs interests were not the only ones to be considered: the German firm of W√∂lber & Brohm was campaigning to round out the borders of Togoland in return for renouncing Kapita√Ø and Koba and Bismarck placed greater value of good relations with France than on trying to secure Colin‚Äôs possessions. On the other hand the ambassador‚Äôs cousin Prince Hohenlohe-Langenburg, who sat on the board of Colin's company, tried to persuade him to ask France to renounce its claims on Kapita√Ø and Koba, otherwise Colin's company would suffer significant losses. Negotiations paused in the summer of 1885, but when they resumed in November of the same year, Herbert von Bismarck's threat to Paris that \\"if necessary, Germany would definitely settle Sangareah Bay\\" was only a bluff to force a decision. In the German-French Protocol of 24 December 1885, Germany finally acknowledged France's sovereignty over the region. In return, the German Empire received Batanga in Cameroon and Anecho in Togo by way of compensation. Colin's \\"German-African business\\" fell under French jurisdiction and Prince Hermann zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg withdrew from the company. Modern era In modern Guinea Koba together with Taboriya forms the subprefecture of Koba-Tatema in Boffa Prefecture. Khabitaye is a 4,900 hectare national park, while Kapita√Ø‚Äôs former administrative centre of Yatiya now falls within the subprefecture of Khorira.

Description Eucalyptus alaticaulis is a tree or mallee growing to a height of about with rough, grey, fibrous bark on the lower part of the trunk and main stems. The leaves on young plants are arranged in opposite pairs, broadly lance-shaped to egg- shaped, up to long, wide and glossy green but a lighter shade on the lower side. The adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and mostly wide and have a longer petiole than the juvenile leaves. They are the same colour on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a flattened peduncle up to long, the individual buds on a short pedicel. The buds are more or less cylindrical with a conical operculum and the flowers are white. The fruit is cylindrical to oval, about long and wide. This species was previously included in E. cypellocarpa but is shorter, has persistent bark and broader juvenile leaves. Taxonomy Eucalyptus alaticaulis was first formally described in 1987 by R.J.Watson and Pauline Y. Ladiges and the description was published in the journal Brunonia.

The album was released on by Blue Note. Background This is his fourth studio album and the fifth overall as a leader. The title Origami Harvest has a certain symbolic significance. Akinmusire mentioned that \\"Origami\\" refers to \\"the different ways black people, especially men, have to fold, whether in failure or to fit a mold\\", whereas \\"Harvest,\\" on the other hand, refers to the repeating cycles that recreate these hierarchical structures in society. The record was commissioned for curators Judd Greenstein of Manhattan's Ecstatic Music Festival and Kate Nordstrum of St. Paul's Liquid Music Series. The release text explains that the project was initiated with Greenstein asking Akinmusire \\"What's the craziest idea you have?\\" and Akinmusire replying \\"I wanted to do a project about extremes and putting things that are seemingly opposite right next to each other.\\" Origami Harvest consists of six lengthy tracks adding up to a full hour of interplay between the classical strings of the Mivos Quartet, Akinmusire on trumpet and keyboards, Marcus Gilmore on drums, and Sam Harris on piano. The band also includes the poet and rapper Victor Vazquez, a former member of Das Racist and Kool A.D. The songs explore such themes as a response to societal divides, the way our politics hold us emotionally hostage, and the ever-growing list of black lives ended by structural racism. The lyrics for penultimate track \\"Free, White and 21\\" consists of the names of African-American people slain in recent years by members of law enforcement or the neighborhood watch. The album unites three different genres of music: small-group jazz, hip-hop, and chamber music. Reception At Metacritic, that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on five reviews, which indicates \\"generally positive reviews\\". John Lewis of The Guardian stated \\"Origami Harvest is his most adventurous work to date... Sometimes the self-conscious collisions of free improv and composition, of high and low art, are so discordant that they are almost unlistenable. The result is a voyage through America that is both dreamlike and dystopian, exhausting but oddly compelling\\". Matt Collar of AllMusic added \\"Origami Harvest, is an ambitious work that finds the trumpeter blending seemingly disparate elements  including spoken word, classical chamber music, free improvisation, and hip-hop rhythms  into a textured if often laborious mix... Origami Harvest may not work for everybody, but for those who take the time to explore the unexpected bends and folds in Akinmusire's construction, a wealth of discoveries can be found\\". Davis Whiteis of JazzTimes commented \\"It‚Äôs become relatively common for jazz artists to incorporate elements of hip-hop into their work, but the fourth studio outing by trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire is one of the more provocative of these mash-up projects to have emerged thus far... Vocabularies, syntaxes, and aesthetic conceits that heretofore might have been considered incompatible meld together in a true ‚Äúfreedom jazz dance‚Äù for a new age\\". Martin Johnson of the Wall Street Journal said \\"With the music on ‚ÄúOrigami Harvest,‚Äù Mr Akinmusire joins a growing number of young jazz musicians who are successfully melding the string-quartet format with intimate jazz settings. David Hajdu of The Nation wrote \\"It brings together three distinct schools of music: small- group jazz, hip-hop, and chamber music. Akinmusire allows each of the three to work on its own terms‚Äîthe jazz impulsive and complex, the hip-hop fierce and allusive, the chamber music nuanced and lyrical‚Äîand each has roughly equal weight in the music as a whole. The result is an album that sounds like nothing other than itself. If it‚Äôs not exactly ideal jazz by traditional standards, it‚Äôs the jazz ideal carried triumphantly into 2018\\".

He died during an unsuccessful mountain rescue attempt in the High Tatras. By . Biography =Early and personal life= The name of Bachleda's father is unknown. His mother was Zofia Bachleda Galian. He was a Goral, an ethnographic group which inhabits the Tatra Mountains on both sides of the modern border between Poland and Slovakia. She died when he was twelve, leaving him an orphan. He earned a living as a shepherd-boy in the high mountains. He later went to Upper Hungary to find work, where he was called up for military service. In 1873, he was discharged, and returned to Zakopane. It was in the grip of a cholera epidemic, and he tended the sick and buried the dead. Thereafter, he supported himself by working as a carpenter, and also by hunting. He married Agnieszka Styrczula from Dzianisz, and they had three children. She died, and he remarried. =Mountain guide= During the late 19th century, mountaineering became a popular pastime for young people from the middle and upper classes across Europe. Men with local knowledge were in demand as guides, and could be well paid. Bachleda took up that profession, initially as assistant to experienced guides such as (1824-1897), (1828 or 1832 - 1913) and the two Jƒôdrzej Walas, (1820-1896) and (1841-1900). In 1886, he was recognised as a Class I guide. In 1898, Jƒôdrzej Wala the younger retired. From then on, Bachleda was called Kr√≥lem Przewodnik√≥w Tatrza≈Ñskich ('King of the Tatra Guides') and Orze≈Ç Tatr ('Eagle of the Tatras'). He is said to have had outstanding qualities of character: tact, minimisation of risk, courage, consideration, self-sacrifice, helpfulness, diligence and honesty. His clients included: Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski (1874-1941, writer, poet, critic and translator), (1878-1968, mechanical engineer and mathematician), (1862-1928, journalist and translator), (1869-1935, physician, painter and folklorist), (1873-1942, merchant), (1861-1956, priest), (1867-1941, writer and publisher), Mieczys≈Çaw Kar≈Çowicz (1876-1909, composer and conductor), Franciszek Nowicki (1864-1935, poet and political activist), (1861-1907, historian), Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer (1865-1940, poet and novelist) and Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916, journalist, novelist and Nobel laureate). He had a talent for orienting himself in difficult, rocky areas, and for mountaineering. He pioneered several routes in the Tatras. These included the descent of the northern wall of Lomnick√Ω ≈°t√≠t (1888), and the first ascents of, among others, (1892), (1895), (1902), (1904), (1904) and (1904). He made the second ascents of Mnich and . He took part in the first winter ascents of (1905) (below Gerlachovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t, the highest peak in the High Tatras), and of Bystr√° (the highest peak in the Western Tatras). He climbed in groups roped together from as early as 1900. He was the first Tatra highlander to learn to ski (no later than 1902). In 1901, (1871-1959, mathematician and statistician) named (), one of the passes between and Lomnick√Ω ≈°t√≠t, in Bachleda's honour. He has more than ten (one source says fifteen) features in the Tatras named after him, including , the easternmost peak of . In 1903, the recently founded ('Tourist Section of the Tatra Society') rewarded him for discovering a new pass through the main ridge of the Tatras, namely . =Mountain rescuer= In 1909, Mariusz Zaruski (1867‚Äì1941, Polish soldier and sportsman) founded Tatrza≈Ñskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (TOPR, 'Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue'). Bachleda became his deputy, and one of its most active and dedicated members. On 6 August 1910, Stanis≈Çaw Szulakiewicz and (1892-1960, competition skier and ski jumper), both students, attempted the northern wall of . They fell, and Szulakiewicz suffered serious injuries. Jarzyna managed to descend and to seek help. Zaruski organised a rescue party. Conditions were atrocious: a violent thunderstorm, and heavy rain mixed with snow and hail. After hours of climbing, the party, nearly exhausted, had reached to about from where Szulakiewicz lay, and could hear him calling out. Zaruski ordered a halt because of the risk to life. Bachleda unroped himself, and continued on alone. He did not return. On 7 August, a second unsuccessful attempt was made to rescue Szulakiewicz. On 8 August, a third attempt reached Szulakiewicz. He had died, probably on the night of 6‚Äì7 August, from injuries and exposure. The weather worsened, and the five-strong rescue party was trapped on the mountain overnight. They brought the body down on 9 August. Bachleda's comrades hoped that he had found another way down. Rain, wind and fog hampered their searches. On 13 August, their worst fears were confirmed: they found his body. He had been caught in a rockfall, and lay in , a high mountain pass. On 15 August, they began to bring him down. On 17 August, he was buried in the in Zakopane. His gravestone bears the Polish-language inscription, Po≈õwiƒôci≈Ç siƒô i zginƒÖ≈Ç ('He sacrificed himself and died'). He was the first member of TOPR to die during a rescue attempt. There is a detailed account of the double tragedy on the TOPR website. Legacy A commemorative plaque was placed at , a valley below the place where he died. It has since been moved to ('Tatra Symbolic Cemetery') on the western slopes of . There is a memorial plaque at , Zakopane. Ulica Klimka Bachledy ('Klimek Bachleda Street') in Zakopane is named after him. He is mentioned in the memoirs of (1878-1968, mechanical engineer and mathematician; who called Bachleda 'one of the most important figures in the history of Zakopane in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century') and of Mieczys≈Çaw Kar≈Çowicz, and in poems by Stanis≈Çaw GƒÖsienica- Byrcyn (1911-1991, poet and writer, son of a Tatra guide and mountain rescuer), Jan Kasprowicz (1860-1926, poet, playwright, critic and translator), (1883-1958, teacher, poet, writer, publicist, and social, cultural and tourist activist), (1897-1976, poet and writer), and (1881-1964, historian, poet, bibliophile, cultural researcher, journalist and educator). Ksiƒôga Tatr ('The Book of the Tatra', 1955) by Jalu Kurek (1904-1983, poet and writer) is a novelised account of Bachleda's life. In 1959, the play Klimek Bachleda (Orze≈Ç Tatr) ('Klimek Bachleda (Eagle of the Tatras)') by Julian Reimsch√ºssel (1908-1984, teacher and writer) was performed in Zakopane.

It connects the stations of Reichenau-Tamins and .  History = Reichenau-Tamins ‚Äì Ilanz highland line= The first proposals for a highland line or Vorderrhein (Anterior Rhine) line go back to 1890. At that time an engineer, Marchion, applied for a concession for the construction and operation of a railway line from Reichenau to Disentis. Marchion then tested a total of four options for the route from Reichenau to Ilanz. The options started either in Reichenau or in Bonaduz: * Bonaduz‚ÄìVersam‚ÄìValendas: 14.7 km-long, large viaducts, estimated construction cost: CHF 6.2 m * Reichenau‚ÄìTrin‚ÄìFlims‚ÄìLaax‚ÄìIlanz: 25.5 km-long, crest tunnel near Flims, estimated construction cost: CHF 5.5 m * Reichenau‚ÄìTrin‚ÄìConn‚ÄìLaax‚ÄìIlanz: 23.7 km-long, several viaducts, and two tunnels estimated construction cost: CHF 6.2 m * a line through the Rhine Gorge: 19.3 km-long, good location, estimated construction cost: CHF 4.3 m. Marchion finally received a concession in 1894 for the Reichenau‚ÄìIlanz route, but he sold it to the Rhaetian Railway on 27 November 1897. This company in turn commissioned engineer R. Moser to review all four options. Finally, a commission headed by Professor Albert Heim from Zurich recommended that the latter option be built through the Anterior Rhine Gorge. The Board of the Rhaetian Railway decided to build a line on this route on 11 July 1898. The RhB also considered an option to extend the line from Ilanz further along the Anterior Rhine to Disentis.  Construction  Construction began in the autumn of 1900 under the direction of senior engineer R. Hennings, who also led the construction work on the Albula Railway at the same time. The 19.3 km- long route was divided into three lots: Reichenau‚ÄìVersam, Versam‚ÄìValendas- Sagogn, and Valendas-Sagogn‚ÄìIlanz. The Rhine gorge presented construction workers and engineers with problems, as the rock there is very brittle and the Anterior Rhine in this area rises very high in heavy rain or during snowmelt. In addition, because of its instability, the rock from the Rhine Gorge could not be used for the construction of walls and track, so all the necessary stones had to be brought from more distant quarries. To facilitate this, section engineer Peter Saluz built a 750 mm gauge steam-hauled construction line, which was not opened until 1901. Despite many interruptions due to landslides and floods, the construction work kept to schedule and the Reichenau-Tamins‚ÄìIlanz line was formally opened on 1 June 1903. = The Ilanz‚ÄìDisentis extension= It took a total of nine years until the extension of the highland line from Ilanz to Disentis could be opened. This was due to the fact that two other complementary lines, Davos Platz‚ÄìFilisur and Samedan‚ÄìPontresina, had a higher priority and thus were built first. Engineer R. Moser, who had been commissioned to prepare the plans for this line, relied on the plans of Engineer Marchion, who intended to build the line on the right bank of the Rhine to Trun and then on the northern slope of the Surselva to Disentis. The final project was developed by the Batignolles company in Paris; its projected lines crossed the Rhine three times, but otherwise, it followed the original plan.  The construction works  Construction began on 10 April 1910 under the direction of Chief Engineer Peter Saluz. The line was divided into four lots: Ilanz‚ÄìPetersbach, Petersbach‚ÄìTrun, Trun‚ÄìSumvitg- Cumpadials, and Sumvitg-Cumpadials‚ÄìDisentis. The first two lots did not cause any problems as they ran along the bottom of the valley and required landfills and embankments only when the line approached the river. The other two lots required the construction of engineering structures and tunnels. Disentis station was designed to be larger than all the other stations, as it had already been planned for the opening of the Furka Oberalp Railway. As construction progressed rapidly along the entire line, it was possible to open the line officially on 1 August 1912 after only two years of construction. New Carrerabach bridge After a construction period of around one year, the new Carrerabach bridge was put into operation on 17 November 2011. Thus, the bridge over the Carrerabach was renewed for the second time since the commissioning of the line. As early as 1981, the original stone arch bridge had been replaced by a new structure. This time, not only was the bridge renewed, but the whole trackbed was rebuilt on a roughly one-kilometre section in order to increase the level in the area of the bridge by around three metres and to move the line laterally in the area of the bridge. The new higher position of the bridge and its displacement was intended to prevent problems with erosion and rockfall and to improve flood protection permanently. Accidents such as one the derailment of a regional train on the Carrerabach bridge on 11 September 2011 due to a mudslide following a storm should be avoided in the future.  Route Altitude profile of the line Two coupled Glacier Express trains in the Anterior Rhine gorge Must√©r railway through Rhine gorge The line begins at the junction station of the highland line and the Albula Railway at Reichenau-Tamins. It branches off the Landquart‚ÄìThusis railway after the steel bridge over the Posterior Rhine. The line then crosses the Anterior Rhine and runs to the entrance of the Rhine gorge at Trin station. In contrast to the parallel road, which rises over 500 metres to Flims and Laax, the railway runs at the bottom of the narrow Ruinaulta gorge. Artificial structures predominate on this part of the line in an otherwise largely untouched landscape. It crosses the gorge with the help of two tunnels and several loops and passes through the stations of Versam- Safien, Valendas-Sagogn and Castrisch. Subsequently, the line runs through the now shallower and wider Anterior Rhine valley to Ilanz where it returns to the side of the road and then climbs at a gradient of 1.6% to Trun. Between Trun and Ilanz, the line crosses the Anterior Rhine three times and passes through two tunnels and the stations of Rueun, Waltensburg/Vuorz and Tavanasa- Breil/Brigels. From Trun, the line runs on the northern valley slope with a gradient of 2.7% through the stations of Rabius-Surrein and Sumvitg-Cumpadials to . Between Sumvitg-Cumpadials and Disentis, the valley becomes narrower and steeper, so there are many engineering structures and bridges, such as the 106 m-long Val Russein viaduct between Sumvitg-Cumpadials and Disentis.  Structures  = Stations =  Versam-Safien  Versam-Safien station with Ruinaulta gorge Versam-Safien station is at the 32.73 km mark of the line. Since the line runs in the very narrow Ruinaulta gorge along the Anterior Rhine, the communities that the stations are named after lie up to three km away and up to 300 m higher. The through station of Versam has two through tracks and two dead-end tracks. The station has a main platform and two island platforms, which are reached by a crossing. The station was built for the opening of the line from Reichenau and Ilanz in 1903. In the past, the importance of the station was higher than it is today. Although a road was completed from Versam to Reichenau and Ilanz in 1881, due to the low motorisation until the 1950s, it must be assumed that the majority of the inhabitants used the railway and thus the station until well into the 20th century. From there they used a stagecoach or in the winter horse sleighs on the unfenced road to Safiental until 1950. The RegioExpress trains of the Rhaetian Railway stop every hour at the station. Freight trains run irregularly and the Glacier Express daily. The Postauto serves the station hourly to spare the passengers the climb to the actual village and to open up the whole Safien valley. The station building is no longer used for rail purposes. Next to the station, there is a wood loading yard, which can be approached via the dead-end tracks.  Valendas-Sagogn  Also, the Valendas-Sagogn station carries a double name but here for another reason: a bridge over the Rhine, which was built during the construction of the line, allowed access to the station from both sides of the Rhine. The station is located on the southern (right) bank of the Rhine and was opened in 1903 and connected on both sides by a dirt road, which was replaced by a paved road on the Valendas side during improvement works in 2010. Services run every hour towards Ilanz and Disentis as well as towards Reichenau-Tamins, Chur and Scuol-Tarasp. The road to Sagogn remains unpaved. = Bridges= One of the most important bridges is the Russein bridge between Sumvitg and Disentis. The arch bridge, built in 1912 from natural stone, is located parallel to the old Russein bridge (a covered wooden road bridge built in 1857). The bridge is almost 100 m-long and crosses the stream at a height of 56 m on four arches. The bridge over the Val Sogn Placi at Disentis was destroyed by an avalanche on 9 February 1984. The 54 m-long stone arch bridge was replaced by a 54 m-long composite reinforced concrete structure. This bridge was put into operation on 16 November 1985. A temporary emergency bridge had been installed in the meantime.  Operations Waltensburg The line is mainly served by RegioExpress trains running at hourly intervals with extra services during the peak hours as required. They take an hour and five minutes over the whole line and reach an average speed of 45.5 kilometres per hour. There are also three Glacier Express train pairs each day. Freight trains running irregularly on the line serve the industrial and commercial enterprises in the Anterior Rhine region.

His murder remains unsolved.  Life  Tristan Br√ºbach was born on 3 October 1984 in Frankfurt am Main to parents Iris and Bernd. Mord an Tristan Br√ºbach: Biographie von Tristan. Iris died of cancer in 1995, leaving Bernd to raise Tristan alone. Br√ºbach grew up in H√∂chst and Unterliederbach, both suburban neighbourhoods on the outer fringes of Frankfurt. He attended Walter Kolb Primary School in H√∂chst before going to secondary school in Sindlingen, another suburb of Frankfurt. Tristan was described as shy but very streetwise, spending a lot of his free time walking around his neighbourhood with no specific purpose. He was extremely fond of animals: despite his shyness in all other scenarios, he would regularly approach strangers of all ages who were walking their dogs, so that he could enter into conversation with them about their pets. Unresolved Podcast  Murder  Br√ºbach was last seen alive at Bruno-Asch-Anlage ‚Äì a park in front of Frankfurt-H√∂chst railway station ‚Äì at 3:20 pm on the day of his murder. His body was discovered by children walking home from school. They returned to the school to tell their teachers, and the police were informed at 5:08 pm. Br√ºbach's body was in a pedestrian tunnel that runs alongside an underground section of the Liederbach river; the tunnel is known locally as the Liederbach Tunnel. Br√ºbach had been beaten unconscious and strangled, though the cause of death was a long slash across his neck. Both testicles, as well as flesh from his buttocks and thighs, had been removed. The murder weapon lay on a concrete block nearby. German Federal Criminal Police Office wanted-person announcement, 2009 The murder had been seen from a distance by three teenagers (not the same people as the children who discovered Br√ºbach's body); however, they did not realise at the time what they were witnessing. These witnesses gave the police a description of the suspect and a composite sketch was produced. Tagesablauf von Tristan Br√ºbach am Todestag, 26.03.1998 In March 1999, a year after the murder, Tristan's rucksack was found in a forest in Niedernhausen, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the crime scene. The rucksack contained a Czech-language road atlas of Germany, which is believed not to have belonged to Br√ºbach, who did not speak Czech and had no reason or means to possess such an item. The police consequently expanded their enquiries to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but no viable leads emerged. Unresolved Podcast  Investigation  =Fingerprinting= A large-scale fingerprinting operation began in 2002. All males aged between 15 and 45 from H√∂chst and Unterliederbach, as well as male commuters in that age bracket who used Frankfurt-H√∂chst railway station (Frankfurt's second busiest) at the time of the murder, have been invited to submit fingerprints samples voluntarily. By 2014, 98.65% of 15-to-45-year-old males from H√∂chst and 92.95% of those from Unterliederbach had done so. =False leads= Among other false leads, an American woman told the police that her German ex-husband was the murderer. However, she later recanted her accusation, admitting that she had made up the story to take revenge on her ex-husband after an acrimonious divorce. =Manfred Seel= On 19 May 2016, the Hessen State Office of Criminal Investigations (Hessisches Landeskriminalamt) in Wiesbaden announced that Manfred Seel was being looked into as a suspect. Seel died in 2014 aged 67. He lived a seemingly ordinary life, holding the same job for decades, raising a family, having no criminal record and being an active and respected member of his local community, among other things being in a jazz band. However, after his death, his daughter was looking through his belongings in a rented storage facility and found human remains and diaries containing graphic descriptions and sketches of murders. The police are certain that Seel murdered at least five women, and perhaps as many as nine ‚Äì primarily sex workers, drug addicts and people suffering from mental illnesses ‚Äì between 1971 and 2004. Seel was considered a potential suspect primarily because he and Br√ºbach lived in the same area, rather than there being any evidence linking him to Br√ºbach's murder. Br√ºbach does not fit Seel's victim profile in terms of age and gender. However, Seel did exhibit sexual sadism in his presumed murders and kept the genitals of some of his victims. In October 2017, the press officer of the Frankfurt Police announced that Seel had been excluded as a suspect in Br√ºbach's murder.http://www.hessenschau.de/panorama/fall-tristan-heisse-spur- zerschlagen-internetfahndung-geht-weiter,tristan-104.html Fall Tristan. Hei√üe Spur zerschlagen - Internetfahndung geht weiter.  Particularities  =Unidentified ponytailed man= The prime suspect is a male aged between 20 and 30 with either a cleft lip or a large scar on his upper lip and of a generally unkempt appearance. This man was seen by several people, all of whom contributed to drawing up the composite sketch. The sketch was shared with law enforcement authorities worldwide, but no suspects matching the image have emerged. The first person to see the suspect on the day of the murder was a 12-year-old girl walking through the Liederbach Tunnel, where Br√ºbach would later be murdered. The girl reported that she saw the man coming out from behind a bush. He was wearing a hat, with a ponytail visibly dangling from the back of it. About a week later, a man turned up at the offices of a law firm and told a lawyer, \\"I've only just been released from prison and I've already screwed up.\\" The lawyer directed the man to another law firm, which dealt with criminal law matters, but the man never went there. A week after this sighting, another witness ‚Äì who gave Br√ºbach private academic tuition ‚Äì came forward. She stated that a few days before Br√ºbach's murder, she had seen him in the company of a man who closely resembled the composite sketch. She was sure that she had seen this man more than once in the recent past. The woman believed to have been the last person to see Br√ºbach alive, at Bruno-Asch- Anlage, provided a description that differed from that of the ponytailed man. According to this witness, she was sitting on a park bench when Br√ºbach, who was alone, sat down on the same bench and smoked a cigarette. The witness briefly engaged in small talk with Br√ºbach before leaving the bench. After she had left, she turned around and saw two men sit down on the bench ‚Äì one to Br√ºbach's left and one to his right. Br√ºbach was murdered between 10 and 25 minutes later, 500 metres away in the Liederbach Tunnel. =Unknown caller= On 7 April 1998, the day after Br√ºbach's funeral, a man called the police to report that he was the murderer. He reported that he was at H√∂chst railway station and would wait there for the police to come and arrest him. When the police arrived, he was nowhere to be found. Parts of the call were made public and can be heard on YouTube. The caller has never been identified. =Grave= In October 1999, an unknown person entered H√∂chst Cemetery at night and dug 1.2 metres into the ground, down to Br√ºbach's coffin. The coffin was not opened. The police believe that the act was committed by a mentally disturbed person with no connection to Br√ºbach or his murder. Under German law, graves in public cemeteries are maintained by the state for a certain period of time (20 years in Hessen, the state where Br√ºbach lived), after which the deceased person's family must pay to lease the grave site if they wish to keep their loved one there. If the family does not pay, the headstone is removed and the grave is reused for a new deceased person. Br√ºbach's father died aged 59 in 2015 and no other relatives could afford to pay the fees to keep Br√ºbach's grave in place, so a public initiative was launched to fund a memorial stone. In March 2018, after Br√ºbach's grave was reused, a memorial stone was erected under a nearby tree, within sight of the grave. =Rewards offered= The Frankfurt am Main Prosecutor's Office is offering 15,000 euros for any information leading to conviction of Br√ºbach's murderer. A private individual has added 5,000 euros to this, making the total reward sum 20,000 euros. Another private individual offered a time-limited 80,000-euro reward, but it expired in May 2016 with no one coming forward. The 20,000-euro reward remains in place.

He grew up in Siebnen (Canton of Schwyz), a small village close to the southern end of Lake Z√ºrich. Slightly unusually for the time, he was born into a family without any stated religious affiliation. The D√ºggelin family had been established in the socially and politically complicated Ausserschwyz region for several generations. Josef D√ºggelin, his father, was a cantonal councillor (\\"Kantonsrat\\") and, by trade, a joiner. Werner D√ºggelin attended schools successively in Siebnen, Engelberg, Trogen and Neuch√¢tel. According to one source he was required to leave both the \\"Monastery School\\" in Engelberg and the \\"Convict School\\" in Trogen (both subsequently renamed) \\"early\\". Spending the final part of his school career in the Francophone west of Switzerland meant that he had to undertake his \\"Matura\\" (school finals) in French rather than in one of the dialects of Swiss German which would have been his mother-tongue as a young boy. He moved on to the University of Zurich where between 1947 and 1949 he studied Romance literature and culture (\\"Romanistics\\"), \\"briefly, and without success\\" (as he himself later recalled). He never completed the course or received a degree. Till he reached the age of around 20, as he much later told Beatrice von Matt, Werner D√ºggelin had never been inside a theatre. His first visit was to the Z√ºrich Playhouse sitting in a box high up on the right side of the auditorium, he experienced what he described as a \\"coup de foudre\\"\\". He knew at once that the theatre was his vocation, not as an actor but as a director: \\"I cannot say what it was - it was just crazy.\\" = Z√ºrich, Paris = He found his way into theatre by working as a lighting assistant at the Z√ºrich Playhouse during the 1948/49 season. It was Leopold Lindtberg, the director at the Playhouse, who recommended that he should progress his career in Paris and helped with the arrangements. During 1949/50 D√ºggelin worked as a Theater manager at Asni√®res on the north-western outskirts of the French capital. Starting in 1950 he worked in Paris with the director Roger Blin on a succession of projects: \\"I was completely devoured by France ... Blin was simply the greatest. [In Blin's theatre I saw] what theatre is\\". = Pioneer = Between 1952 and 1963 D√ºggelin worked as a freelance theatre director in Switzerland and abroad. Back in Z√ºrich he worked with Blin on the German language premiere of \\"Waiting for Godot\\"! At the end of 1954 they were ready to present it, which they did on the so-called \\"Pfauenb√ºhne\\" (\\"Peacock Stage\\") of the Z√ºrich Playhouse. It was Werner D√ºggelin who had translated the text from Beckett's English language original, and he then worked on it as Blin's production assistant. Unfortunately the good citizens of Z√ºrich were not in a mood for the avant- garde. Ticket sales were \\"miserable\\". \\"The public stayed away\\". In the mid-1950s D√ºggelin started staging his own productions, starting at the \\"Teater am Central\\" in Z√ºrich with a successful stage production of a German language stage production of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. A career breakthrough came at the Staatstheater in Darmstadt (West Germany) in 1957 with his Darmstadt production of Goethe's Urfaust (the precursor to the better known later version of Faust). It was also at Darmstadt that he directed the German language premiere of Marcel Achard's \\"Darf ich mitspielen?\\" (\\"Might I play with you?\\"). Staging productions in German of the work of non-German language dramatists has become a theme in D√ºggelin's career. Along with playwrights already mentioned, D√ºggelin has been among the first to stage German production of works by Eug√®ne Ionesco, Georges Schehad√©, Albert Camus, Jean Genet and Paul Claudel. In 1956 he directed at the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel (theatre) in Munich, where his work included a memorable production of Bidermann's Cenodoxus. Over the next few years he guested as a stage director at some of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world, notably in Basel, Vienna and Stuttgart. He has also, more recently, dabbled in opera. In 1963 he staged Pinkas Braun's German language version of Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" at Hamburg. It was also in 1963 that he exchanged his freelance status for a permanent position as stage director at the Z√ºrich Playhouse, still under the overall direction of his mentor and the man who had helped him break into the world of theatre more than ten years earlier, Leopold Lindtberg. = Basel = In 1968 Werner D√ºggelin moved to Basel, a more culturally dynamic and diverse city than Z√ºrich, after accepting an appointment as director of the City Theatre. This marked the beginning of what several commentators identify as a golden age for the Basel Theatre. Supported by an exceptional team, he oversaw a succession of engaged and politically tinted productions which caught the spirit of a new generation, provoking commentators and moving audiences to take a more frequent interest in Basel theatre productions. = Grand old man = After 1975 D√ºggelin again worked on a freelance basis, regularly returning to work in Z√ºrich and Basel, but still sometimes stepping further afield. For three years, between 1988 and 1991, he ran the Swiss Cultural Centre in Paris which had been set up in 1985. He is described by √âtienne Dumont as the first independent head of the centre. His predecessor, Otto Ceresa, had been a part- time director who had combined his duties with his principal job as a senior manager at Pro Helvetia. Before that, as initially configured, the centre was run on a collegiate basis by a group of six individuals. Later productions included Beckett's \\"Endgame\\" (1994) and Moli√®re's \\"The Misanthrope\\" (1997), both at Z√ºrich. A number of tribute pieces published in celebration of D√ºggelin's ninetieth birthday made the point that, despite his advanced age, he was still working at the profession he loved, his ear for the dramatists' true intent more acutely tuned than ever. Though D√ºggelin was primarily revered as a stage director, completeness requires mention of his television work. Some of his best recalled small-screen adaptations and productions included \\"L'Histoire du soldat\\" (1975) by Ramuz, \\"The Black Spider\\" (1986) by Gotthelf and a \\"Hommage to Tinguely\\" (1989). Swiss artists with whom he worked include Jean Tinguely, Eva Aeppli, Bernhard Luginb√ºhl and Schang Hutter.

Early life and family Born in England, in the London district of St Pancras, on 9 March 1876, Grocott was the son of Joseph Henry Grocott and Hannah Dryden. He was baptised at Holy Trinity Church, Marylebone on 4 June 1876. In 1877, the family emigrated to New Zealand, where Joseph and Hannah were married the same year. Harold's younger brother, Horace, was born in Napier in 1880, and soon after, they moved to Dunedin. On 4 March 1901, Harold Grocott married Elizabeth Bazley at First Church, Dunedin. The couple went on to have one son‚ÄîEric Harold Grocott, who was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for community service in the 1979 New Year Honours‚Äîand one daughter. Professional career By 1902, Grocott was in charge of Wilkinson and Sons' branch chemist shop in George Street, Dunedin, and was living above the shop. Two years later, he had his own chemist's shop in Roxburgh, building a large new house and shop in Scotland Street, and he took on Sydney Smith, who would go on to become a renowned forensic scientist and pathologist, as an apprentice. Grocott sold the business in 1907. After a short period in Eltham where he owned a pharmacy, Grocott later moved to Hamilton, purchasing Arthur Edwards Manning's pharmacy business and optometry practice in 1911. Manning went on to serve as mayor of Hamilton from 1912 to 1915. In 1920, Grocott travelled to London, where he passed the examinations set by the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers, gaining him Fellowship in Optometry of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers (FSMC). He was also admitted to the Freedom of the City of London by redemption, in the Company of Spectacle Makers, and was appointed as a Fellow of the British Institute of Opticians.

At the Games, they won four of their nine round-robin matches to finish in fifth place. Other activities Grocott was an active Rotarian in Hamilton. He attended the Rotary International Convention in Denver, Colorado, in 1926, where he was appointed as a member of the elections committee for the convention.

Besides her fellowship with the Peterson Institute for International Economics and recent position with the World Bank, Freund has served in three previous roles with the World Bank: Chief Economist for the Middle East and North Africa from 2011 to 2013, and Senior and Lead Economist in the Development Research Group for International Trade from 2002 to 2009 and 2009 to 2011, respectively. She has also held posts with the International Monetary Fund and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, Freund has served on numerous boards and committees. These include the Advisory Board of the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States, the Scientific Committees of the CEPII and Economic Research Forum, and the Centre for Economic Policy Research.  Research and publications  Freund's research primarily focuses on trade and economic growth. = Research on trade = Regarding trade, Freund has published on regionalism as well as other areas of trade.  Research on regionalism  Three of Freund's works related to this topic are discussed below: In 2008, together with Antoni Estevadeordal and Emanuel Ornelas, she wrote a paper (titled \\"Does Regionalism Affect Trade Liberalization Towards Non-Members\\") looking into the effects of regionalism on unilateral trade liberalization (a country's removal of their own trade barriers and restrictions) using data for ten Latin American countries from 1990 to 2001. The paper finds that although preferential tariffs (import tariffs that are lower for countries involved in a bilateral trade agreement than for countries not a part of the agreement) for a sector and that sector's common external tariff are positively related, this relationship does not appear in customs unions, in which a common external tariff must exist. As such, Freund and her co-authors conclude that claims asserting that preferential tariff liberalization has a negative effect on external tariff liberalization are not legitimate. In 2009, together with Emanuel Ornelas, she published a literature review (titled \\"Regional Trade Agreements\\") of theoretical and empirical research on regional trade agreements (RTA), which had been the most widespread form of trade liberalization since the mid-1990s. The review discusses three issues related to RTAs from both a theoretical and empirical lens: an increase in trade diversion because of government lobbying by groups to create trade agreements with significant distortion, a slowdown or contraction of external trade liberalization, and a weakening of a multilateralism approach. Freund and her co-author find that from a theoretical standpoint, all three issues are justifiable. However, from an empirical standpoint, they find that neither an increase in trade diversion nor a slowdown in external liberalization can be seen, and a weakening of multilateralism has yet to be properly measured. In 2010, together with Emanuel Ornelas, she wrote a paper (titled \\"Regional trade agreements: blessing or burden\\") examining the strengths and weaknesses of RTAs, which as noted above had seen a surge in popularity since the early 1990s. Freund and her co-author note that RTAs generally lead to trade creation, but can also lead to trade diversion on occasion, albeit in low amounts. They conclude that, with consideration to current empirical data, RTAs appear to be more of a blessing than a burden.  Research on other areas of trade  Three of Freund's works on other topics in trade are discussed below: In 2000, together with Diana Weinhold, she wrote a paper (titled \\"On the effect of the Internet on international trade\\") concerning the impact of the Internet (measured by the number of web hosts in a country) on international trade, utilizing a gravity model of trade on 56 countries. They find that in the years 1995 and 1996, there was no evidence and weak evidence, respectively, of the Internet stimulating trade. In 1998 and 1999, however, they do find significant evidence, specifically that a 10% increase in the number of web hosts in a country would have led to an approximate 1% increase in trade. The paper also concludes that the impact of the Internet on international trade is more pronounced for poor countries than for rich countries, and that the Internet has had an insignificant effect in decreasing the impact of distance on trade. In 2004, together with Matias Berthelon, she published a paper (titled \\"On the conservation of distance in international trade\\") about the increase in the effect of distance on international trade (as dictated by the gravity model of trade), despite trade volume having grown more than twice as fast as real income since 1980. Two possible explanations for this observation are: countries are trading a greater quantity of goods that are sensitive to distance, and that distance has become more vital for a larger proportion of traded goods. In their research, Freund and Berthelon find that trade's increased dependence on distance is due to changing relative trade costs across a country's industries. They also find that differentiated goods are half as likely to have turned more distance-sensitive than non-differentiated goods. In 2006, together with Simeon Djankov and Cong S. Pham, she wrote a paper (titled \\"Trading on time\\") on how time delays affect international trade, specifically looking at World Bank data on the time it takes to move cargo from factory to ship in 126 countries. Controlling for endogeneity and remoteness, they find that, on average, each additional day of delay is the same as a country increasing its distance from its trading partners by 70 kilometres. Additionally, they find that delays are even more damaging to a developing country's exports. = Research on economic growth = More recently in her position with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Freund directed a greater amount of her research toward economic growth. Three of Freund's works regarding economic growth are discussed below: In 2016, together with Sarah Oliver, she published a paper (titled \\"The Origins of the Superrich: The Billionaire Characteristics Database\\") that provides a new dataset on the characteristics of the very wealthy and how those characteristics differ across first-world nations and have changed over time. The dataset classifies the billionaire as either inherited or self-made, and further classifies the self-made billionaires as company founders, executives, politically-connected, or in finance. It also identifies the company and industry from which the billionaire's wealth comes. Freund and Oliver's analysis shows that over half of European billionaires are inheritors, while only a third of American billionaires are, and that the median age of European billionaires' companies are almost 20 years older than American billionaires'. Their analysis also demonstrates that Europe's increase in wealth can be attributed to growth in traditional sectors, while the US's wealth increase is the result of growth in the finance and technology sectors. Lastly, they find evidence that the number of billionaires is increasing at a higher rate in the US than in Europe, and that American billionaires are becoming more wealthy over time than European billionaires. In 2017, together with Dario Sidhu, she wrote a paper (titled \\"Manufacturing and the 2016 Election: An Analysis of US Presidential Election Data\\") investigating how voting patterns from the 2016 presidential election were affected by manufacturing jobs and manufacturing job loss, using county-level voting data. Controlling for other voting factors, Freund and Sidhu find that the effect of employment and job loss in the manufacturing sector on changes in Republican votes from 2012 to 2016 is not statistically significant. They do find, however, that changes in Republican votes between those elections and manufacturing are positively associated in counties that are predominantly white, and negatively associated in counties that have racial diversity. In 2019, together with Chad P. Brown, she published a paper (titled \\"The Problem of US Labor Force Participation\\") that looks into the US's decrease in labour force participation (people of working age who are either employed or seeking employment) from 1995 to 2017. For men, they find that this decrease is due to a combination of structural-based rationale and disability. For women, they find that disability is an even stronger cause, estimating that almost two- thirds of the decline can be attributed to disability. The authors also note that other countries have experienced increases in unemployment rather than decreases in labour force participation like the US has. = Other publications = At the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Freund published a book (titled \\"Rich People Poor Countries: The Rise of Emerging- Market Tycoons and their Mega Firms\\") with the assistance of Sarah Oliver in 2016. In the book, Freund analyzes 700 emerging-market billionaires and finds that these wealthy figures are transitioning poor countries from their current agriculture-based economies to a world of multinational industries, thus playing a role in the industrialization of the modern economic climate. Freund has also published editorials for news outlets such as Bloomberg Opinion (formerly known as Bloomberg View) and The Washington Post.

The series was produced by Marvel Studios through Marvel Television and Marvel Animation, with Blum serving as showrunner. Patton Oswalt stars as M.O.D.O.K., a supervillain struggling to handle his company and family. Aimee Garcia, Ben Schwartz, Melissa Fumero, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Beck Bennett, Jon Daly, and Sam Richardson also star. M.O.D.O.K. was officially announced with a series order at Hulu in February 2019, as part of a group of series based on Marvel characters that were intended to lead to a crossover special titled The Offenders, with it being produced by Marvel Television and Marvel Animation. Oversight of the series was moved to Marvel Studios in December 2019 when Marvel Television was folded into that company. The cast was announced in January 2020, with writing and recording completed later. Stop-motion animation for the series is provided by Stoopid Buddy Stoodios. M.O.D.O.K. is set to be released on Hulu in early 2021.  Premise  After spending years failing to gain control of the world and battling superheroes along the way, M.O.D.O.K., having been removed from his company A.I.M. after it falls into bankruptcy and is sold to the rivaling GRUMBL, begins to deal with his tainting family while facing a mid-life crisis.  Cast and characters  Patton Oswalt as George Tarleton / M.O.D.O.K.: A floating robotic engineered head who is the former leader of A.I.M. and is obsessed with having control and conquering the world.

The series was created by Jordan Blum and Patton Oswalt, both of whom were expected to write for the series and executive produce alongside Jeph Loeb. In December 2019, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, which carried subsequent oversight of the series. The following month, Marvel decided not to move forward with Howard the Duck, Tigra & Dazzler, and The Offenders, with M.O.D.O.K. and Hit Monkey continuing as planned. = Writing and casting = The series' announcement revealed that Oswalt was set to voice M.O.D.O.K. In January 2020, Craig Erwich, Hulu's Senior Vice President of Originals, revealed that \\"a few episodes of\\" the series had completed recording, which was followed shortly by the announcement of Aimee Garcia, Ben Schwartz, Melissa Fumero, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Beck Bennett, Jon Daly, and Sam Richardson as the series' cast. By that October, Oswalt confirmed that writing and audio recording for the series had concluded, under the working title Bighead. Oswalt stated that Marvel allowed him and the creative team to include a variety of popular and relatively unknown characters in the series, which include several superheroes and members of X-Men-related teams. = Animation = Work on the stop-motion aspects of the series were revealed to have been completed by October 2020 with Stoopid Buddy Stoodios providing the visuals for the episodes, which had \\"every frame [packed] with crazy detail\\". During the series' New York Comic Con online panel later that month, Oswalt revealed that Stoopid Buddy Studios created \\"innovative technology\\" that used handheld-styled cinematography techniques for the stop-motion puppet designs of the characters and environment.  Music  Daniel Rojas serves as the composer for the series.  Marketing  In September 2020, Hulu revealed the series' logo, and Entertainment Weekly released first look images for the series on October 9, 2020, ahead of a panel that was held during the virtual New York Comic Con later that day, where Blum and Oswalt presented two clips from the series and a behind-the-scenes B-roll.

His senior commands include the post of Quartermaster- General of the Swedish Army (1904‚Äì1905) and chief of the General Staff (1905‚Äì1919). Bildt was also a member of parliament for Norrbotten County representing the Protectionist Party for eight years. Career Knut Gillis Bildt was born on 13 July 1854 in Stockholm, Sweden, the younger son of the then major, later the Governor of Stockholm and the Prime Minister of Sweden, Friherre Gillis Bildt and his wife Rosa Lucie Dufva, and brother to the diplomat, the member of the Swedish Academy etc., Friherre Carl Bildt. After having passed the cadet course at the Military Academy Karlberg in 1869-71, he was commissioned as underl√∂jtnant in the Life Regiment Dragoon Corps in 1871 and was three years later promoted to lieutenant there. That same year, the father had become Swedish envoy in Berlin and the son now attended the Prussian Staff College there from 1875 to 1878. After returning home, in 1880 he was transferred to the General Staff, where he became captain in 1883. Since 1883 Bildt belonged to the then Crown Prince Gustaf's staff, for whom he was the chief for a number of years. In 1883 he also was appointed to be a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College and remained on this post until he, in 1890, advanced to ryttm√§stare in the Life Regiment Dragoons. In 1891, Bildt was promoted to major in the General Staff was appointed head of its Communications Department. Bildt was then vice chief of the Military Office of the Ministry of Land Defence from 1892 to 1893. He was moved in 1893 as lieutenant colonel and first major to Sm√•land Hussar Regiment (Sm√•lands husarregemente), where in 1896 he became colonel and regimental commander. He was also head of the Crown Prince's staff from 1896. In 1899, Bildt was elected by Norrbotten County County Council to the F√∂rsta kammaren, of which he for three years (1900-1902) was a member of the Committee on the State (Statsutskottet). Bildt was also a member of the 1907 Special Defense Committee, within which he put in an extremely successful and appreciated work, although he was eventually forced to see a reconciliation proposal adopted, for which he did not consider himself able to give his vote. In the Rikdag the following years, he belonged to those who were eager to urgently deliver on the promise of suffrage extension as a complement to conscription extension, and declared his adherence to the Committee on the Constitution's compromise proposal rather than giving in to the uncertain path of a proportionalist parliamentary memorandum. Bildt was also a member of several committees; the Committee on Sweden's Permanent Defense (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende Sveriges fasta f√∂rsvar) 1897-1898, in the Committee on Field Service Regulations for the Army (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende f√§lttj√§nstreglemente f√∂r arm√©n) in 1899, in the Coastal Artillery Committee (Kustartillerikommitt√©n) in 1899-1900 and in the War Legislative Committee (Krigslagstiftningskommitt√©n) from 1901. He was also a member of the Committee on the State from 1900 to 1902 and in Special Committee (S√§rskilt utskott) in 1901. After 1902 having been transported back to the Life Regiment Dragoons as colonel and executive officer (sekundchef), he was promoted to major general in 1904 and appointed Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army and commanding officer of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermaster Department and of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps, and appointed the following year to chief of the General Staff. In 1910, Bildt was promoted to lieutenant general. Bildt's activities in the General Staff, he had presented inH√§rordningsl√§rans grunddrag : h√§rordningen i allm√§nhet (1885), which can be said to be an overview of the basic principles of contemporary German war science. Bildt's ideal was an army order with a permanent peace organization of permanent troop units, which during war outbreaks without changeover could occupy the conscripts. As chief of the General Staff, Bildt carried out a complete reorganization of the same. Innovation was his business even for the organization of war preparations. In the tactics, Bildt sought to adapt modern views to the country's special conditions, for example through in-depth trials with winter warfare in northern Sweden's mountain and forest terrain, coastal and border defense, operations in the dark, exercises in long-term war and heavy artillery use in mobile warfare, as well as several technical news. Bildt's strong interest in the theory of war was manifested in the General Staff, including when he dedicated to the War History Department the study of Charles XII's war. The result was the famous work Karl XII p√• slagf√§ltet (1918-1919). Later he published H√§rordningsfr√•gor (1922), in which he summed up the teachings of the World War I. In many ways he showed himself there on the position he had taken because of his early studies in Germany. For the value of news, such as the tank weapon and the air force, he did not show a particularly distinct mind.

It is located adjacent to the British Saint-D√©sir War Cemetery and is unique as the two burial grounds are linked by a pathway. It is the smallest German war cemetery in Normandy and contains the remains of 3,735 German military personnel. The cemetery was created by the British Graves Registration Commission in August 1944 with British and German casualties buried in adjacent fields. Saint-D√©sir-de- Lisieux is usually chosen as the cemetery for newly discovered German war dead from across Normandy. The cemetery is maintained and managed by the voluntary German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge). History The majority of the German war dead buried at Saint-D√©sir-de- Lisieux were killed during the last days of the Battle of Normandy and inside the Falaise Pocket in August 1944. A high number come from the 7th, 15th, 7th Panzer Armies as the Allies pushed the Germans out of Normandy, across the Seine and towards Paris. The British Graves Service created the cemetery for both fallen Commonwealth and German service personnel. German soldiers that had been buried in field graves and small local cemeteries were disinterred and brought to Saint-D√©sir-de-Lisieux. Formation In the late 1950s the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge) remodelled and expanded the cemetery. Headstones were replaced with red sandstone plaques giving the names, ranks, dates of birth and death of two fallen German soldiers. Saint-D√©sir-de-Lisieux was officially inaugurated as a German War Cemetery on 21 September 1961. Personal fates Buried at the cemetery: *First Lieutenant Horst Hannig, a fighter pilot ace with 98 aerial victories, killed in action May 1943. *Major Kurt Ubben, a fighter pilot ace with 110 aerial victories, killed in action April 1944. *Lieutenant Colonel Egon Mayer, a fighter pilot ace with 102 aerial victories, killed in action March 1944. Volunteer maintenance Unlike the American and Commonwealth War Graves Commissions, the German Commission is entirely voluntary and relies on gifts and collections to further its work. During the summer months one may see international school children tending the graves. They volunteer to work with the Volksbund during their school holidays and visit American and German war cemeteries, memorials, sites of the invasion and take part in the memorial ceremony with veterans and the mayor of La Cambe.Sophia K√ºhn, Pauline Schurund, Lisa Thuriam: Eine wundervolle Erfahrung (Tales of some workcamp participants) See alsoList of military cemeteries in Normandy References External links Cemeteries in Calvados (department) German War Graves Commission World War II cemeteries in France World War II memorials in France Cemeteries in Normandy ","title":"Saint-D√©sir-de-Lisieux German war cemetery"},{"id":"60017772","text":"Cedar Springs is a rural unincorporated community in northeast Allen County, Kentucky, United States.

The 95,000 names listed are those of some suspected 140,000 to 150,000 victims. Most are men, with women compromising only around 5,000 of those listed on the site. This is a result of women, as victims, not being recognized by either the Franco regime or later researchers until very recently. A similar situation exists with homosexuals being under-represented by the project, with Todos (..) los nombres_ working to address the gap in both. The information on the site comes from other sources, including government created rolls of people who were used as forced labors, and roles of people at concentration camps, prisons, and colonies.  Funding  Asociaci√≥n Andaluza Memoria Hist√≥rica y Justicia (AMHyJA) and Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo de Andaluc√≠a (CGT.A) signed a collaboration agreement, along with a sponsorship agreement with Patrocinio de la Consejer√≠a de Justicia y AA.PP. de la Junta de Andaluc√≠a and a collaboration agreement Fundaci√≥n El Monte and the Universidad Pablo de Olavide on 3 October 2005. The agreement ended on 3 October 2007, but was extended for six months. Sponsorship changed in the period between 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009 to the Ministerio de la Presidencia del Gobierno de Espa√±a. This agreement was renewed for the same periods in 2010-2011 and 2011‚Äì2012, finally terminating on 30 October 2012. A sponsorship agreement, initially through a grant, was signed with Administraci√≥n Local y Relaciones Institucionales de la Junta de Andaluc√≠a on 9 September 2012. This arrangement ended on 19 September 2013. Direcci√≥n General de Memoria Democr√°tica gave a grant to the site that started on 16 December 2013 that ended in December 2014. For 2015, funding for the site came exclusively through Recuperando la Memoria de la Historia Social de Andaluc√≠a (RMHSA de CGT.A). Consejer√≠a de Cultura de la Junta de Andaluc√≠a budgeted specific grant money for the site with the approval of the Consejer√≠a de Presidencia. A similar arrangement was done for 2017. Cecilio Gordillo was the coordinator of the project in 2019, with the site listing the names of 96,762 people that year. The election of Vox in 2019 in Andalucia brought a lot of uncertainty to the project because Vox supports a positive narrative about the history of the Franco regime. Gordillo hoped that Fernando Mart√≠nez and the government of Pedro S√°nchez would assist in making sure their project, and the memories of all the disappeared, would be protected as a result of the government change in Andalusia.  Staff  Cecilio Gordillo was the coordinator of the project in 2019. Jos√© Luis Guti√©rrez Molina served as the scientific director in 2019.  Historical memory  Todos (..) los nombres_ plays an important role in maintaining historical memory in Andalusia. It allows relatives of those who were victims of the Franco government to read and contribute biographies about victims, and access historical documents related to disappearances of victims. A round table about the site was held as part of a broader colloquium on historical memory in Andalusia in February 2019.  Size  Names are searchable by first surname and second surname. The 95,000 names in it as of August 2018 includes victims from Andalusia, Extremadura and North Africa. Of the names listed, around 5,000 are women and 91,000 are men. The site grows as family and project collaborators add to them. People included were killed because of reprisals, while in prison, because they were given death sentences by war councils, and because of purges of specific professions. It also includes names of exiles, those who were stripped of their property by the regime and those who were used as forced labor. Beyond the 95,000 names, the site had around 790 microbiographies and 1,300 documents that are freely accessible. It also has 209 downloadable books. Cecilio Gordillo estimated in July 2018 that the listings could grow to 140,000 or 150,000 before it is complete. The site listing the names of 96,762 disappeared people in 2019.  Sources  Todos (..) los nombres_ relies on other sources to document who disappeared and write biographies of victims. One of the most important sources of data has been lists who people who were used as forced labors, and roles of people at concentration camps, prisons, and colonies. These were some of the first sources they sought to add to their database.  Coverage of women  There were 5,000 women included in August 2018. The reason so few women were included is that until recently, many women who disappeared were not considered victims. Only recently, with people doing more research into those who disappeared during the Civil War period, has there been recognition that there has been a double gender repression. People researching female victims for the site have discovered that many women had their heads shaved as punishment, but their names were not listed on roles of those punished by Franco's forces.  Coverage of homosexuals  Another group under-represented by todos (..) los nombres is homosexuals. While the LGBT community is much more visible in modern Spain, much is unknown about this group that was specifically targeted by Franco's forces. Homosexual sexual victims lack names and relationships to others, making documenting and visualizing their plight harder.

Unveiled on February 20, 2019, it was released on September 6, 2019 in South Korea. The device is capable of being folded open to expose a 7.3-inch tablet-sized flexible display, while its front contains a smaller \\"cover\\" display, intended for accessing the device without opening it. The Galaxy Fold received mixed pre-release reception, with praise for its innovative design, but with critics noting that the screen's plastic coating was not as premium or durable as a traditional glass smartphone screen, and concluding that the Galaxy Fold was a proof of concept device for early adopters rather than a device suited for the mass market. Critics also displayed concerns over the Galaxy Fold's susceptibility to damage by debris due to the lack of protection around the display hinge; after the screens of several review units were damaged in this manner, or by users accidentally removing a protective plastic layer on top of the screen (which could be mistaken as a standard screen protector). In response to these issues, Samsung announced that it would delay the release of the Galaxy Fold indefinitely while it addressed the problems. Samsung officially detailed its design changes in July, and released the phone in September 2019. The company claimed to have sold one million units since launch by December 2019, but Samsung later denied having sold 1 million units, and admitted having reported sales expectations as actual sales. A version of the device was released exclusively for China Telecom, marketed as the Samsung W20 5G with a faster Snapdragon 855+ processor and a unique white finish. The W20 went on sale on December 12; it is available in two colours (Space Silver and Cosmos Black). With the announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip, Samsung's foldable phones, which includes the Fold, will now be a part of the Samsung Galaxy Z series. The Galaxy Fold category on the Samsung US portal now redirects to the newly-added ‚ÄòGalaxy Z‚Äô category, and even the Galaxy Fold store page has had its URL changed to include the Galaxy Z moniker.  Development  A prototype of the Galaxy Fold (obscured to hide its final design) and its \\"Infinity Flex Display\\" was unveiled during a Samsung developers' conference in November 2018, demonstrating the adaptations to Samsung's Android distribution and newly-unveiled One UI software. Google stated that it would work with OEMs to support foldable devices on Android (an effort achieved natively in Android 10).  Specifications  Galaxy Fold in a position for one handed use The Galaxy Fold contains two displays; its front cover contains a small, 4.6-inch display in the center designed for one-handed use, and the device can fold open to expose a 7.3-inch display. Samsung rated the fold mechanism as supporting up to 200,000 uses. The tablet screen contains a large notch in the top-right corner, and is coated with a custom multi-layer laminate in lieu of glass. Its power button contains a fingerprint reader. Samsung did not state which system-on-chip it uses in the Galaxy Fold, beyond that it is a \\"state-of-the-art\\" CPU with a 7 nanometer production process, contains 12 GB of RAM, and has 512 GB of non-expandable storage. Teardowns later revealed that it was the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, which is used in all regions (unlike other Samsung phones that have been split between Snapdragon and Samsung's in-house Exynos chips depending on the market). The Galaxy Fold will be sold with a 5G variant. The device contains two batteries split between the two halves, totaling a 4380 mAh capacity. The Galaxy Fold contains 6 cameras, using the same sensors equipped on the Galaxy S10+, including three rear-facing camera lenses (12-megapixel, 12-megapixel telephoto, and 16-megapixel ultra wide-angle), as well as a 10-megapixel front-facing camera on the cover, and a second 10-megapixel front-facing camera, accompanied by an RGB depth sensor, on the inside screen. The Galaxy Fold ships with Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" and Samsung's One UI software; by means of Multi Window mode, up to three supported apps can be placed on-screen at once. Apps open on the smaller screen can expand into their larger, tablet-oriented layouts when the user unfolds the device. Reception Digital Trends praised the Fold's software, performance, camera and main screen, while criticizing the price, the front screen design and the lack of water resistance. Chokkattu remarked that \\"[it's] a lot of fun to use because it's so new\\", but noted that \\"it remains technology that's out of reach for most people\\". CNET felt that the inside of the device felt \\"toy-like\\" in contrast to the premium exterior, noting the fragility of its screen, a plastic bezel, a \\"ridiculous and unnecessarily large\\" notch, a crease in the screen visible from certain viewing angles, and gaps at the top and bottom of the hinge that were potentially susceptible to dust and debris. The lack of water resistance was also noted, and it was felt that the size of the cover screen made typing difficult. It was concluded that the Galaxy Fold was a \\"testbed device for developers and the earliest adopters to buy, and for the rest of us to ponder over\\". Dieter Bohn of The Verge considered the fold-out tablet screen a \\"joy\\" to use, but remarked that its thick form factor and small cover screen made the Galaxy Fold less suited for shorter, frequent uses like a smartphone. He also panned the display for not being as smooth as a glass screen, being susceptible to scratches and blemishes over time, the aforementioned crease, the large notch, a \\"jelly\\" distortion between the two sides when scrolling, and having too many potential points of failure. Bohn praised its high-end hardware, and especially its batteries, and felt that multitasking was flexible but inelegant, and buggy with certain apps on transitions between modes. In conclusion, he felt that the Galaxy Fold was \\"legitimately a marvelous thing to play with\\", but that the device was more of a status symbol than a legitimate consumer product. Issues Review units showed a high rate of display failure; a teardown by iFixit noted that the crease contained noticeable gaps at the top and bottom, making it susceptible to foreign debris coming under the screen. This resulted in \\"bulges\\" experienced by multiple reviewers, including Blick, and The Verge‚Äîwhose screen was damaged in this manner. At Samsung's request, this teardown was removed from the website, although it was later reinstated after the re-release of the Galaxy Fold. In addition, a number of other reviewers damaged the screen by mistakenly removing one of the clear laminate layers that covers it. Samsung advised that the \\"special protective layer\\" that coats the screen must not be removed, as doing so may cause damage to the screen. Concerns were raised that consumers may mistake it for a pre-installed screen protector without proper advisories: retail units of the Galaxy Fold did contain a disclaimer. Samsung later stated that it would \\"thoroughly inspect\\" the defective review units to investigate the issues. After reports surfaced that Samsung had postponed a Chinese launch event, Samsung announced on April 22 that the launch (originally set for April 26) had been delayed indefinitely while they work to fix the issue, with plans to announce the new release date sometime within the coming weeks. Samsung later announced that Galaxy Fold pre-orders would automatically be cancelled if the device had not been shipped by May 31, and the customer had not otherwise confirmed their order. On May 24, 2019, U.S. retailer Best Buy cancelled all pre-orders. AT&T; subsequently cancelled pre-orders on June 13, 2019, announcing that it would issue refunds, as well as complimentary US$100 bill credits. CNET drew comparisons between the postponement and the battery- related recalls of the Galaxy Note 7. On a test by CNET, the Galaxy Fold's hinge only lasted for 120,000 folds (equivalent to 3 years of use) out of the advertised 200,000 folds (equivalent to 5 years of use). = Delay = On July 24, 2019, Samsung announced that it was now targeting a September release, and detailed design changes intended to help reinforce the screen and protect the hinge. There are now \\"caps\\" on the top and bottom of the hinge area, extra layers of metal under the screen to improve its sturdiness, and the protective layer is extended under the bezels to hold it in place and prevent accidental removal. Samsung also stated that it had reduced the space between the hinge and body of the device. Samsung issued more detailed care instructions with the new release, advising users against placing items or adhesives on the screen, pressing the screen with hard objects, exposure to liquids or small particles, removing the protective layer, and also warning about placing the phone near items sensitive to magnets (such as magnetic stripe cards and medical implants), The Verge felt that the new instructions were akin to \\"a pharmaceutical ad that has to disclose dozens of side effects\\". In the U.S., Samsung is distributing the Galaxy Fold solely through AT&T; retail stores, Best Buy, and Samsung retail stores. These outlets will be equipped to offer \\"Premier Service\\" for the device, including an orientation session post- purchase that will include device setup, data migration from an existing phone, and one-on-one instruction on how to use its features. The \\"Premier Service\\" program also includes a dedicated customer support line specific to Galaxy Fold-related issues, and the ability to purchase a one-time screen replacement out-of-warranty from one of the aforementioned outlets for US$149 (however, the device still carries a standard one-year warranty).

During his lifetime he gained a reputation of sorcerer in Chilo√© and is remebered so in local folklore. The first-order waterway of Moraleda Channel is named after him.  Biography  He is well known for discovering the underrated yet unbelievably comfortable poncho in Chile. Several historians have called him a hypocrite for deeming the Chilean ponchos publicly as \\"horrific\\", yet his only goal was to prevent others from using them. He was born in 1750 in Pasajes San Pedro in the Spanish Basque country, he was son of navy officer Manuel de Moraleda, and grew up in a family related to maritime activities. At young age Jos√© Moraleda attended naval courses at Real Escuela de Navegaci√≥n in C√°diz, which later led him to work as naval officer in Spain's American possessions. Moraleda arrived to Chilo√© Archipelago in 1786 being commissioned by Viceroy of Peru Teodoro de Croix to help local intendant Francisco Hurtado del Pino in making accurate maps of the archipelago. The Patagonian maps of Jos√© de Moraleda are the first known improvement in Spanish cartography of western Patagonia since the Antonio de Vea expedition of 1675‚Äì1676. In 1804 he obtained the grade of \\"teniente de nav√≠o\\", the highest of one of his category.Gonz√°lez-Ripoll, M. D. (2000). Moraleda died in the port of El Callao in 1810 in the Viceroyalty of Peru at an age of 60 years. Legacy Moraleda wrote and drew a series of diaries on navigation diaries, courses, maps, as well as varied commentaries on ethnography and coastal fortifications. These diaries are: * Viage al puerto del Callao o de Lima, en la urca afragatada del Rey, del porte de 40 ca√±ones, nombrada Nuestra Se√±ora de Monserrat, a√±o de 1772 * Viage de reconocimiento de las Yslas de Chilo√©.

These works were partly edited by Diego Barros Arana in 1888 as \\"Esploraciones jeogr√°ficas e hidrogr√°ficas de Jos√© de Moraleda i Montero\\". Between 1887 and 1888 these works were edited again, this time in two volumes in the Chilean Navy's \\"anuarios hidrogr√°ficos\\" by Francisco Vidal Gormaz. thumb200x200px Signboard with historical highlights of the town of Tena√∫n mentioning the which Chillpilla and Jos√© de Moraleda.

Moraledas works as well as professional qualities are praised by Alessandro Malaspina in his extensive letter to the Spanish interior minister Antonio Vald√©s. Moraleda is the subject of Hugo O'Donell's book \\"El viaje a Chilo√© de Jos√© de Moraleda (1787-1790)\\" which was published in 1990 in Madrid. Twenty years later he was the subject of an essay named \\"Moraleda, explorador del Pac√≠fico insular\\" in a publication of Untzi Museoa-Museo Naval of Donostia. Legend of Moraleda as sorcerer In the oral traditions of Chilo√© Archipelago Moraleda is attributed mythical characteristics. He is alleged to have had a magical skills competition with the Huilliche witch Chillpila in which she made Moraleda's ship run aground. She would then have received in exchange a book on European witchcraft by Moraleda. There is no trace of this supposed duel in Moraledas writings, but he did notice that local witches and sorcerers considered him \\"more machi, fortune teller, or sorcerer than all of them\\" (\\"m√°s machi, adivino o brujo que todos ellos\\"). The mythical encounter with Chillpila would have occurred in 1786 and served later as founding myth for the secret Huilliche society of La Mayor√≠a or Recta Provincia.

The history of the Sylhet region begins with the existence of expanded commercial centres in the area that is now Sylhet City. Historically known as Srihatta and Shilhatta, it was ruled by the Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms of Harikela and Kamarupa before passing to the control of the Sena and Deva dynasties in the early medieval period. After the fall of these two Hindu principalities, the region became home to many more independent petty kingdoms such as Jaintia, Gour, Laur, and later Taraf, Pratapgarh, Jagannathpur, Chandrapur and Ita. After the Conquest of Sylhet in the 14th century, the region was absorbed into Shamsuddin Firoz Shah's independent principality based in Lakhnauti, Western Bengal. It was then successively ruled by the Muslim sultanates of Delhi and the Bengal Sultanate before collapsing into Muslim petty kingdoms, mostly ruled by Afghan chieftains, after the fall of the Karrani dynasty in 1576. Described as Bengal's Wild East, the Mughals struggled in defeating the chieftains of Sylhet. After the defeat of Khwaja Usman, their most formidable opponent, the area finally came under Mughal rule in 1612. Sylhet emerged as the Mughals' most significant imperial outpost in the east and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century. After the Mughals, the British Empire ruled the region for over 150 years until the independence of India. There was a complete list of the different amils who governed Sylhet which was recorded in the office of the Qanungoh (revenue officers) of Sylhet. However, most complete copies have been lost or destroyed. Dates from letters and seal traces show evidence that the amils were constantly changed. In 1947, when a referendum was held, Sylhet decided to join the Pakistani province of East Bengal. However, when the Radcliffe Line was drawn up, Karimganj district of Barak Valley was given to India by the commission after being pleaded by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar's delegation. Throughout the History of Sylhet, raids and invasions were also common from neighbouring kingdoms as well as tribes such as the Khasis and Kukis.  Ancient  Ruins of the Jaintia Rajbari, a royal palace in Jaintiapur - the capital of the Jaintia Kingdom According to historians, Sylhet was an expanded commercial centre inhabited by Brahmans under the realm of the Harikela and Kamarupa kingdoms of ancient Bengal and Assam. Buddhism was prevalent in the first millennium. The Hindu epic known as the Mahabharata mentions the marriage of Duryodhana of the Kauravas into a family in Habiganj, Sylhet. The Purana also mentions the hero Arjuna travelling to the Jaintia to regain his horse held captive by a princess. The region is also home to two of the fifty-one body parts of Sati, a form of Durga, that fell on Earth according to accepted legends. Shri Shail and Jayanti are where the neck and left palm of Sati fell and are Shakti Peethas. The Gour Kingdom, established in the 7th century, took part in many battles with its neighbouring states. Eventually it would split into two - Gour (Sylhet) and Brahmachal (South Sylhet/modern-day Moulvibazar). The region was also home to many petty kingdoms such as Laur and Jagannathpur and part of larger kingdoms such as the Jaintia and Twipra Kingdoms. In 640, the Raja of Tripura Dharma Fa planned a ceremony and invited five Brahmans from Etawah, Mithila and Kannauj. To compensate for their long journey, the Raja granted them land in a place which came to be known as Panchakhanda (meaning five parts) in Western Sylhet. Towards the end of the millennium, the Candras ruled over Bengal. A 930 AD copper-plate of Srichandra, of the Chandra dynasty of East Bengal, was found in Tengubazar Mandir, Paschimbhag, Rajnagar detailing his successful campaign against the Kingdom of Kamarupa. In the early medieval period, the area was dominated by Hindu principalities, which were under the nominal suzerainty of the Senas and Devas. The history of the dynasties in the region is documented by their copper-plate charters. Evidence from inscriptions also suggest there was an ancient university in Panchgaon, Rajnagar. A copper-plate inscription of Raja Marundanath in Kalapur, Srimangal was discovered dating back to the 11th century. In 1195, Nidhipati Shastri, a Brahman from Panchakhanda who was descended from Ananda Shastri of Mithila, was given land in Ita (Rajnagar) by the Raja of Tripura. Ita was feudal to the Kingdom of Tripura and part of its Manukul Pradesh. Nidhipati became the founder of the Ita dynasty which would later gain a Raja status and based himself in Bhumiura-Ettolatoli. He established many dighis (ponds) and khamar (fields) which still exist today such as Shoptopar Dighi and Nidhipatir Khamar. He was succeeded over the feudal rule of Ita by his son, Bhudhar and then his grandson, Kandarpadi. Keshab Misra, a Brahman from Kannauj, migrated to Laur where he established a Hindu kingdom. After the death of Raja Upananda of Brahmachal (modern-day Baramchal, Kulaura), Govardhan of Gour allowed Amar Singh to rule over southern Sylhet. Singh was unable to cope and died shortly after. The Kuki chiefs then annexed Brahmachal (Southern Sylhet) to the Twipra Kingdom ruled by Ratan Manikya. Jaidev Rai was appointed to govern Brahmachal under the Tripura king. The penultimate Raja Govardhan of Gour was killed in a battle against Kuki rebels and the Jaintia Kingdom in 1260. He would be succeeded by his nephew, Gour Govinda, who would reunite Northern Sylhet (Gour) and Southern Sylhet (Brahmachal). Govinda dismissed Govardhan's chief minister Madan Rai and appointed Mona Rai as his minister instead.  Medieval  = Delhi Sultanate period = An ancient prayer rug from Konya. Inscriptions in the Mosque of Shah Jalal describe the Sufi leader as a Kuniya (from Konya). Some accounts state that Shah Jalal's father was a contemporary of Jalaluddin Rumi. During the time of the Delhi Sultanate's conquest of Bengal, Sylhet continued to be made up of petty kingdoms. Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Shah, the governor of Bengal who later claimed independence from Delhi, carried out invasions into neighbouring regions such as Assam, Tripura, Bihar and Sylhet and making them his tributary states.KingListsFarEast Bengal In 1254, Governor of Bengal Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak invaded the Azmardan Raj (present-day Ajmiriganj). He defeated the local Raja, and plundered his wealth. The 14th century marked the beginning of an emerging Islamic influence in Sylhet. In 1303, the Sultan of Lakhnauti Shamsuddin Firoz Shah's army defeated the Hindu Raja Gour Govinda. This war began when Ghazi Burhanuddin, a Muslim living in Tultikar sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's aqiqah or celebration of birth. Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege, had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off.EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N. \\"Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East. Vol. 2\\". Sarup & Sons, 2002. p.459 The general's army was aided by a Sufi missionary, Shah Jalal, and his companions. Chief minister Mona Rai was killed in the battle and Govinda fled with his family. The Kingdom of Srihatta was then renamed as Jalalabad (settlement of Jalal) under the Lakhnauti Sultanate. Sikandar Khan Ghazi, one of the commanders of the battle and Firoz's nephew, was then made the first Muslim and wazir to rule over Sylhet. Sikander ruled for a number of years under Shamsuddin Firoz Shah until his death, when he drowned while riding a boat.Sreehatter Itibritta ‚Äì Purbangsho (A History of Sylhet), Part 2, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Achyut Charan Choudhury; Publisher: Mustafa Selim; Source publication, 2004 He was succeeded by Haydar Ghazi, appointed by Shah Jalal himself.Syed Murtaza Ali's History of Sylhet ; Moinul Islam The Raja of Laur, Ramnath (descendant of Keshab Misra), had three sons with only one remaining in central Laur. Ramnath's second son, Durbar Khan, migrated to Jagannathpur to build his own palace. He later seized his youngest brother, Gobind Singh's, territory in Baniachong. = Sonargaon rule = Map showing the voyages of Ibn Battuta. The Moroccan traveler visited Sylhet during the reign of Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah. The Delhi Sultanate's control of Bengal gradually weakened as rebel governors declared independence. During the early 14th-century, Bengal was divided between three small sultanates- Sonargaon in the east, Lakhnauti in the west, and Satgaon in the south. Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah became the independent Sultan of eastern Bengal with a realm covering Sonargaon, Sylhet, and Chittagong. His kingdom was powerful enough to withstand the kingdoms of Arakan and Tripura. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta visited Sylhet during this period and met with Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah and Shah Jalal. Fakhruddin was succeeded by his son Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah. = Bengal Sultanate period = Shankarpasha Mosque was completed circa 1513. After the defeat of the last Sultans of Lakhnauti and Sonargaon between 1342 and 1352, Sylhet passed to the control of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah who unified a wider region into the Bengal Sultanate. Bengali Muslims were exploiting the fertile land of Sylhet for agricultural production and enjoyed relative prosperity innovating a contemporary agrarian society. The Taraf Kingdom, founded by Syed Nasiruddin, was transformed into a hub of Islamic and linguistic education. Prominent writers and poets hailing from medieval Taraf and its surrounding areas included Syed Shah Israil (Sylhet's first author), Muhammad Arshad, Syed Pir Badshah and Syed Rayhan ad-Din. The region began to experience an influx of Muslim settlers, including Turks, Pashtuns, Arabs, and Persians. After the death of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, Bengal was then ruled by Sikandar Shah. In 1384, a young Persian man by the name of Mirza Malik Muhammad Turani migrated to Sylhet with a large force and established the Pratapgarh Kingdom (also including Deorali and Bhanugach) after marrying the daughter of the local ruler who had no children to take the throne. The Kingdom was subordinate to the Maharaja Maha Manikya of the Manikya dynasty of Tripura. In 1437, Adwaitacharya was born in Nabagram, Laur Kingdom. Muqabil Khan was the Wazir of Sylhet in 1440. In 1463, Sylhet was governed by Khurshid Khan who built a mosque near Anair Haor in Hatkhola. Many mosques were built during this period such as an Adina Mosque replica in Dargah Mahalla built by Majlis Alam, the Dastur of Sylhet, in 1472. Alam also built the Goyghor Mosque in South Sylhet with his father, Musa ibn Haji Amir. Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid in Taraf as well as numerous dargah complexes commemorating Shah Jalal and his disciples were also built in this period. Alam was succeeded by Muqarrab ud- Daulah and Muazzam Khalis Khan respectively. In 1479, a mosque inscription in Tilapara, Muktarpur mentions another minister by the name of Malik Sikandar. In addition, 1486 marked the birth of Chaitanya whose ancestral homes are in Golapganj and Baniachong. Hindus believe Chaitanya was a reincarnation of Krishna and will return during the Kholi Zug. In 1499, a Persian nobleman from Isfahan known as Prince Sakhi Salamat settled in a rural village in South Sylhet known as Prithimpassa (now located in Kulaura). Being a wealthy nobleman; his son, Ismail Khan Lodhi, was granted a jagir by the Mughals and given the status of Nawab in addition to other prestigious titles. In 1511, Alauddin Husain Shah's general Rukun Khan was made the governor of Sylhet. In 1512, Khan enlarged the dargah of Shah Jalal, according to an ancient Persian inscription. Khan was succeeded by Gawhar Khan Aswari. Bhanu Narayan of the Ita dynasty defeated a rebel of the Tripura Kingdom. The Tripura Raja then awarded him as the first raja of the Ita kingdom (Rajnagar), subordinate to the Kingdom. In 1489, Pratapgarh ruler Turani's great-great-grandson Malik Pratap declared independence from the Tripura Kingdom whilst the Tripura Raja Pratap Manikya II was busy fighting a war against his elder brother, Dhanya. Malik then allied with the Tripura Raja in the war, and so Manikya formally recognised the independence of the Pratapgarh Kingdom and gave him the title of Raja.R. M. Nath, The Back-ground of Assamese Culture (1978), p. 81 Raja Bazid of Pratapgarh, the grandson of Raja Malik Pratap, repulsed an invasion by the powerful neighbouring kingdom of Kachar. He then expanded the power and influence of his own kingdom, stretching its frontiers as far west as the borders of Jangalbari in Kishoreganj. In light of these achievements, Bazid gave himself the new title of Sultan, placing himself on the same level as the Sultan of Bengal Alauddin Husain Shah. The governor of Sylhet under the Bengal Sultanate, Gawhar Khan Aswari later passed away. His deputies, Subid Ram and Ramdas, took advantage of his death and embezzled a large amount of money from the state government before fleeing to Pratapgarh. Sultan Bazid gave his protection to the two deputies and took advantage of Gawhar's death to seize Sylhet town into his kingdom.Subƒ´ra Kara, 1857 in North East: a reconstruction from folk and oral sources (2008), p. 135 Husain Shah then sent his minister, Sarwar Khan of Barsala, to negotiate with Pratapgarh and see if he can return Sylhet to Bengal.Milton S. Sangma, Essays on North-east India: Presented in Memory of Professor V. Venkata Rao (1994), p. 74 After the rejection of Bazid, Surwar defeated him and his allies, the Zamindars of Ita and Kanihati, in battle.Bangladesh Itihas Samiti, Sylhet: History and Heritage, (1999), p. 715 Bazid was allowed to continue as ruler of Pratapgarh with relative independence, but he was required to surrender his control of Sylhet and give up the title of Sultan. A tribute of money and elephants was given to show Bazid's loyalty and Subid Ram and Ramdas, were sent to Hussain Shah to face punishment. Surwar Khan then became the Nawab of Sylhet, with Bazid's daughter Lavanyavati being given in marriage to Surwar's son and eventual successor, Mir Khan. Towards the end of the Sultanate era, Western Sylhet and Eastern Mymensingh became the Iqlim-e-Muazzamabad governed by Khawas Khan. Muazzamabad was originally founded by Shah Muazzam ad-Din Quraishi, the son of Shah Kamal Quhafa. Its capital was at Kamalshahi (Shaharpara) and also had a second administration at Nizgaon (Shologhar, Sunamganj Sadar). The Assamese claim that Chilarai of Kamata, the brother of King Nara Narayan, took over parts of the Sylhet region, including Jaintia Kingdom, in 1553. In this same time period, Taraf was subordinate to the Twipra Kingdom during the reign of Maharaja Amar Manikya. When Syed Musa, the ruler of Taraf, refused to provide labour for Manikya, a war took place in Jilkua, Chunarughat. Musa was backed by Fateh Khan, the Afghan zamindar of Sylhet. Taraf and Sylhet were briefly conquered by the Tripuris. Khwaja Usman would later capture Taraf and Uhar. During the rule of the Kangleipak King Khagemba, the King's brother, Prince Shalungba, was disappointed with Khagemba's treatment so he fled to the Sylhet region where he allied with Bengali Muslim leaders. With a contingent of Sylheti soldiers, Shalungba then attempted to invade Manipur but the soldiers were captured and made to work as labourers in Manipur. These soldiers married local Manipuri women and adapted to the Meitei language. They introduced hookah to Manipur and founded the Pangal or Manipuri Muslim community.  Mughal period  Farhad Khan's Shahi Eidgah, straddling a hilltop, was the site where the Muharram Rebellion would take place in 1782. The Mughal invasions and conquests in Bengal started during the reigns of Emperors Humayun and Akbar. The Battle of Rajmahal in 1576 led to the execution of Daud Khan Karrani, ending the Karrani sultanate. However, the Pashtuns and the local zamindars known as Baro Bhuyans led by Isa Khan, the ruler of Bhati, continued to resist the Mughal invasion. After the death of Isa in 1599, the Baro-Bhuyan confederacy started to weaken. The Ain-i-Akbari notes the prevalence of slaves, oranges, timber and singing birds in the region. Bengal was integrated as a Mughal province known as the Bengal Subah by 1612 during the reign of Jahangir. The Finance Minister of the latter emperor, Raja Todar Mal, estimated Sylhet to be worth ¬£16,704 in 1582. The Qanungoh (revenue collector) of Sylhet was assisted by pargana patowaris. Each pargana's revenue was collected by a choudhury. However, even during the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, Mughal authority in Sylhet was still referred to as Bengal's Wild East due to the region becoming a refuge for the Afghan chieftains and other Baro-Bhuiyan insurgents. Khwaja Usman of Bokainagar, Mymensingh fled to Sylhet where he allied with the likes of Bayazid Karrani II of Sylhet, Anwar Khan of Baniachong, Pahlawan of Matang and Mahmud Khan. The final raja of the Ita Kingdom, Raja Subid Narayan, built his fort in the Barua Hills, which remains today as ruins. He is also known to have built more large ponds such as the Balda Sagar and Sagar Dighi initially for his daughter, Kamla Rani, and to make space for a palace. Subid lost a battle in 1610 in which South Sylhet became under the rule of Afghan chieftain Khwaja Usman. Usman's rule was interrupted after Mughal General Islam Khan I's attack in 1612 leading to complete Mughal control of Sylhet. Ludi Khan was appointed the Amil of Sylhet. He was succeeded by his son, Jahan Khan who was a minor assisted by the Tehsildars of Taraf; Basu Das and Rajendra. In 1618, the Jaintia Raja Dhan Manik conquered Dimarua leading to a war with Maibong Raja Yasho Narayan Satrudaman of the Kachari Kingdom. Dhan Manik, realising that he would need assistance, gave his daughter in hand to Raja Susenghphaa of the Ahom kingdom. The Ahoms then fought the Kacharis allowing an easy escape for Dhan Manik and the Jaintians. Sylhet became a sarkar of the Bengal Subah. Its eight mahals/mahallahs included Pratapgarh-Panchakhanda, Bahua-Bajua, Jaintia (parts of Jaintia Kingdom), Habili (Sylhet), Sarail-Satra Khandal (North Tripura), Laur, Baniachong and Harinagar. Sylhet emerged as the Mughals' most significant imperial outpost in the east and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century. The sardars of Sylhet during Jahangir's reign included Mubariz Khan, Mukarram Khan, Mirak Bahadur Jalair, Sulayman Banarsi and his son, and Mirza Ahmad Beg. During the rebellion of Prince Khurram, Mirza Saleh Arghun - a relative of Khwaja Usman - was made the faujdar of Sylhet. Muhammad Zaman Karori of Tehran was made the Amil of Sylhet by emperor Jahangir after the Emperor arrived to Bengal and punished the rebels. Zaman took part in Islam Khan I's Assam expedition and was instrumental to the capture of Koch Hajo. He later on became faujdar of Sylhet in 1636 by Shah Jahan and was made a mansabdar of 2,000 sowar.Inayat Khan, Shah Jahan Nama, trans. A. R. Fuller, ed. W. E. Begley and Z. A. Desai (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1990), 235. In 1657, Shah Shuja, the Subahdar of Bengal, granted 50 bighas of land to zamindar Alam Tarib. During the reign of Shah Jahan from 1628 to 1658, the faujdars were Muizz ad-Din Rizvi, Sohrab Khan and Sultan Nazar. During the reign of Aurangzeb in the 17th century, the sarkar generated annual revenues of 167,000 takas. Lutfullah Shirazi, the faujdar of Sylhet, established a strong enclosure in Shah Jalal's dargah in Sylhet town in 1660. Isfandiyar Khan Beg succeeded Shirazi in 1663 and was known to have destroyed Majlis Alam's Adina Mosque replica in Dargah Mahalla because the imam started Eid prayers without waiting for him. Following its destruction, Isfandiyar attempted to rebuild it. The mosque, located near the Dargah Gate, remains uncompleted today, hidden behind trees. The next faujdars were Syed Ibrahim Khan, Jan Muhammad Khan and Mahafata Khan. Farhad Khan was the most well-known of Sylhet's faujdars. He built Sylhet Shahi Eidgah, which still remains as the largest eidgah in the region today as well as numerous bridges across the Sarkar. He was succeeded by Sadeq Khan and then Inayetullah Khan. After the death of Laur Raja Durbar Khan, his younger brother Gobind Singh took over his land. Durbar Khan's sons then informed the Nawab of Murshidabad of this incident. Gobind was summoned to Delhi for a short time where he accepted Islam. As a reward, he was granted the title of Khan and regained Laur but as a feudal ruler. Prince Azim-ush-Shan, the subahdar of Bengal, is said to have granted Hamid Khan faujdarship to Sylhet & Bundasil. Rafiullah Khan, Ahmad Majid and Abdullah Shirazi were the faujdars of this period. Faujdar Karguzar Khan was known to have gifted land to Kamalakanta Bhattacharya of Ita in 1706. A year later, Karguzar was succeeded by Mutiullah Khan and then in Rahmat Khan in 1709. Emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Talib Ali Khan as the next faujdar. After Farrukhsiyar's death, Talib was replaced by Shuja ad-Din Muhammad Khan of Asadganj in 1719. In the early 1700s, the Jaintia Raja Ram Singh kidnapped the Kachari Raja. The Raja of Cachar then informed Ahom Raja Rudra Singh Sukhrungphaa which led to the Ahoms attack through North Cachar and Jaintia Hills. Jaintia was annexed to the Ahoms and its capital city, Jaintiapur, was then raided by the Ahoms and thousands of innocent civilians were put to death or ears and noses were cut off. Sukhrungphaa then informed the Faujdar of Sylhet that Jaintia was under his rule and that it is him that they will trade to. However, the Ahom rule in Jaintia was weak and short-lived. The Jaintias rebelled in their own land defeating the Ahom soldiers. Ram Singh, however, died as a captive to the Ahoms and his son, Jayo Narayan took over the Jaintia Kingdom. In the middle of the seventeenth century, Babu Kabi Ballabh, a descendant of Sarbananda of Barsala, mastered the Persian language. After impressing Emperor Muhammad Shah, Ballabh was given the title of Rai. Ballabh was then made the Qanungoh and Dastidar of Sylhet by the Nawabs of Murshidabad. The role of the Dastidars were to approve and seal the sanads. He was succeeded as Qanungoh and Dastidar by his son, Subid Rai who established a Dastidar family home which he named Subid Rai Gridha. Harkrishna Das was from his progeny. Das' mother sent him off to a fakir in Murshidabad who would educate him in the Sanskrit and Persian languages. He then assisted Rajballabh, the deputy of Nawazish Muhammad Khan, in writing an account on Bengal's revenue. After this service, the Nawab of Murshidabad granted Das Rs. 10,000 as a reward and carried on working in the Murshidabad court. Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Shukurullah Khan as the next Faujdar after Shuja. Although Shukurullah had good relations with the Nawabs of Dhaka, he did not get on well with the local authorities and was dismissed quickly. He was replaced by Harkrishna Das who became the 11th Nawab of Sylhet in late 1721. Nicknamed Mansur al-Mulk, Das was murdered in 1723 by his own men who are presumed to have been loyal to Shukurullah. The Nawabate of Sylhet was then divided between three individuals; Naib Sadatullah Khan, Hargovinda Rai and Manik Chand. Shukurullah returned to his post as faujdar in 1723. The last ruler of Muazzamabad, Hamid Khan Qureshi accepted the post of faujdar after Shukurullah.Ali, Syed Murtaja, Hazrat Shah Jalal and Sylheter Itihas, 66: 1988 In August 1698, he earned the title of Shamsher Khan after assisting the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, in defeating Rahim Khan Afghan in Chandrakona. Shamsher Khan had 6 naibs; Shuja ad-Din (previous faujdar), Basharat Khan, Syed Rafiullah Hasni of Rafinagar, Muhammad Hasan and Mir Ilyas Khan. Shamsher was killed in 1740 in the Battle of Giria alongside the Nawab of Bengal, Sarfaraz Khan. The zamindar of Laur, Abid Reza, son of Gobind Khan, left Laur to establish Baniachong in the early eighteenth century, which would become the largest village in the world. Many followed Reza to Baniachong after Laur was burnt by the Khasi in 1744. The Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan is said to have granted 48 large boats to the Baniachong zamindars.Hunter, William Wilson (1875). \\"District of Sylhet: Administrative History\\". A Statistical Account of Assam. 2. A short while after, Reza built a fort in Laur which remains as ruins today. His son, Umed Reza, excavated much of Baniachong during his zamindari. Both Rezas were feudal under the Amils or Faujdars of Sylhet. Alivardi Khan granted the deputy governor of Dhaka, Nawazish Muhammad Khan, to also govern Sylhet, Tripura and Chittagong. The next faujdar was Bahram Khan. He gifted land to Bhattacharya of Shamshernagar in 1742. Bahram built the mosque located next to Shah Jalal's dargah in 1744. He appointed Muhammad Jan as his Naib. Bahram was succeeded by Ali Quli Baig of Alikulipur (near Badarpur). Baig's leadership was short and Naib Ali Khan became the next faujdar. Ali Khan granted land in 1748 to Kamala Kanta Bhattacharya of Lauta and Ram Chandra Vidyabagish of Dinajpur. He also granted land to Gangaram Siromani of Burunga in 1750. A 1740 Latin map of South Asia by Germans refers to the hilly region as Sirote.  Company rule  The Mulnicherra Estate is the oldest tea garden in South Asia. In 1757, the Nongkhrem-Khairam Khasi Raja closed the Sonapur Duar, stopping trade between the Jaintia and Ahom kingdoms. An envoy of Jaintias assembled at Hajo where they informed the incident to Ahom Raja Suremphaa Swargadeo Rajeswar Singh who re-opened it for them. Sylhet came under British administration in 1765 and made a part of the Bengal Presidency. William Makepeace Thackeray was made the first Collector of Sylhet and he was followed by Mr Sumner. Sylhet was strategically important for the British in their pursuit of conquering Northeast India and Upper Burma. The British divided the region into four subdivisions further divided into collectory zilas and then parganas. The Qanungohs were abolished for a time during British rule and Wahdadars replaced Choudhuries as local revenue collectors. North Srihatta consisted of Parkul, Jaintiapur and Tajpur zilas. South Srihatta was made up of Rajnagar, Hingazia and Noyakhali. Habiganj was split into Nabiganj, Laskarpur and Shankarpasha. Sunamganj had one collectory zila at Ramulganj and Karimganj at Latu. During this time, many Western European and Armenian traders migrated to Sylhet and are buried in Sylhet Sadar. Major Henniker led the first expedition to Jaintia in 1774. In 1778, after a short term by Mr Holland, the next collector was Robert Lindsay. A year into his office, the Khasi attacked the merchants of Pandua, Bholaganj (Companiganj) who were going towards Calcutta after experiencing abuse from other 'Europeans'. Many merchants pleaded Lindsay to build a small brick fort to protect them from further attacks from the Khasi. During the same year, an auction took place in which a purchaser won estates in Balishira (South Sylhet). With the former owner refusing to give the land, a havildar and ten sepoys were sent to the estate to allow the purchaser his land. The former owner killed two officers and injured many. He then plundered two government boats worth over 2,000 rupees. Reinforcements were sent from Sylhet to Balishira, eventually forcing the former owner to flee. The former owner later returned with a large group of men and attacked the resistance, keeping some as hostage. The former officer and some of his men were later arrested by the authorities in Dacca. In 1782, the first ever uprising in the Indian subcontinent which was against the British rule, the Muharram Rebellion, took place in Sylhet Shahi Eidgah in which Lindsay killed two of the leaders of the rally, the Pirzada and Syed Muhammad Hadi, with his own pistol. The other leader, Syed Muhammad Mahdi was also killed in the conflict alongside other rebels. In 1783, the headquarters of a thana was attacked by Khasis who were provoked by a certain havildar. The Khasi chiefs demanded the havildar's head which Lindsay refused to give. Many casualties and deaths occurred on both sides, Lindsay's chunam works were plundered and his men were said to have been \\"cut into pieces\\". In 1786, the Revolt of Radharam took place in the Greater Pratapgarh. Zamindar Radha Ram plundered Chargola thana in Karimganj with the help of Kukis before escaping. Lindsay reacted by ordering for the burning of Radha Ram's village and the seizing of his cattle. It is said in another incident that the hill tribes attacked the Laur thana, killing 20 people including the thanadar. In 1787, the Khasis of Laur also rebelled, plundering many parganas, such as Atgram, Bangaikunda, Ramdiga, Betal and Selharas, and killing up to 800 people. Before Lindsay's troops could arrive, the Khasis retreated back to their mountains. Hyndman succeeded Lindsay in late 1787 as the Collector of Sylhet but his term was extremely short and John Willes replaced him. During Willes' office, the Khasi led by Ganga Singh plundered Ishamati thana and bazaar and killed a Bara-Chaudhri family. In 1789, Willes stationed many sepoys in Pandua (Companiganj). The Khasi however, continued their attacks, killing the thanadar and many sepoys. Two European merchants managed to escape and inform Willes of the incident, who passed it on to the Government at Calcutta. A force was then sent from there, to the village of Pandua although it led to a bloodless end. Willes also told the government that he really had little control over northern Sylhet as the Khasi chiefs refused every order, would behead the messenger and then continue raiding Sylheti villages as they had done even during the Mughal period. Another Khasi raid took place in 1795 and many years went after that with the Khasis remaining in their hills and not troubling the plains. Willes also changed the administration of Sylhet into ten zillahs, further divided into 164 parganas as well as Kusbah Sylhet. Revenue was then collected by ten zillahdars assisted by the pargana patowaris. The currency of the Sylhet region was changed from cowries to silver coins. During his term, Laskarpur Pargana was also moved from Dacca to Sylhet. Courts were also being established in every zillah. In 1799, Agha Muhammad Reza invaded Cachar. With help of Nagas and Kukis, he was able to defeat the barqandaz sent by the Raja of the Kachari Kingdom, and expelled the Raja to the nearby hills. Reza also sent 1,200 men to attack the nearby thana of the East India Company, administered by one havildar and eight sepoys. The Kachari army then arrived with 300 men and two grasshopper cannons but were defeated. During this time, the British were able to gain a reinforcement of 70 sepoys. The army ended up in a brawl between the Kacharis, and the British sepoys eventually drove both groups back leading to 90 deaths in the Kachari side. Reza was later arrested. A border dispute started in 1807 between the Khaspur Raja of Cachar, Krishnachandra Narayan, and the Amin Muluk Chand in Badarpur. The Amin would lay down a line, only to find that the Kacharis would fill the ditch up and take all the crops. The Kacharis would also raid Chapghat pargana. The British ordered Badarpur's officer to prevent the intruders from this but they found out that the land in fact belonged to the Raja and not the Amin. In 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to Kali. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop. During the First Anglo-Burmese War in the same year, British troops based themselves at Badarpur. They then advanced to Bikrampur in Cachar where they were defeated. In 1826, the Kukis of Pratapgarh King murdered a group of woodcutters and held three hostages after not receiving an annual gift from the Pratapgarh zamindars. The Kukis then sent one hostage to the British to tell them that they must pay a ransom to free the other two, in which the British agreed. With the last Khasi raid taking place in 1795, the British experienced another attack in 1827 in Panduah leading to the death of a sepoy, postman and dhobi. The Agent to the Governor-General of India, William Amherst, was absent and so the Collector of Sylhet ordered his officer to retaliate with the Sylhet Light Infantry. After the Nongkhlao massacre in Kanta Kal village two years later, Captain Lister and the Infantry defeated the Nongkhlao Khasis, causing them to retreat and never attack the British or raid villages again. Ganar Khan was the last Faujdar of Sylhet. During his office, two processions were being prepared by Sylhet's Muslim and Hindu communities respectively. The Islamic month of Muharram in the Sylhet's history was a lively time during which tazia processions were common. This happened to fall on the same day as the Hindu festival of Rothjatra (chariot procession). Sensing possible communal violence, Ganar Khan requested the Hindu community to delay their festival by one day. Contrary to the Khan's statement, a riot emerged between the two communities. During one of the riots, the King of Manipur Gambhir Singh was passing through the city of Sylhet whilst on a British expedition against the Khasis. As a Hindu himself, Singh managed to defend the Hindus and disperse the Muslim rioters with his Manipuri troops. The Rothjatra was not delayed, and the Manipuri king stayed to take part in it and was revered by the Hindu community as a defender of their faith. The Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832. Three were sacrificed in Great Hindu temple in Faljur, with one escaping and informing the British authorities of the atrocities. After the Jaintia Raja declined to find the culprits, the British finally conquered the Jaintia Kingdom and incorporated it into the Sylhet District in 1835. Also in 1835, pargana patowaris were replaced by zillah patowaris and muhuris. The East India Company first initiated their trading of tea in the hills of Sylhet.Colleen Taylor Sen (2004). Food Culture in India. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 26. . The first commercial tea plantation in British India was opened in the Mulnicherra Estate in Sylhet in 1857. The region started to emerge as the centre of tea cultivation in Bengal and major export. Many local entrepreneurs also started founding their own companies such as Syed Abdul Majid, Nawab Ali Amjad Khan, Muhammad Bakht Mazumdar, Ghulam Rabbani, Syed Ali Akbar Khandakar, Abdur Rasheed Choudhury and Karim Bakhsh. Syed Abdul Majid was a notable pioneer in the native tea industry. In the anti-British Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, 300 sepoys who revolted against the British, looted the Chittagong Treasury and took shelter with Nawab Gaus Ali Khan of Prithimpassa. The treasury remained under rebel control for several days. A rebellion also took place in Latu, Barlekha.  British Raj  Sylhet was constituted as a municipality in 1867. Walton was made the Collector and Magistrate and he was assisted by William Kemble. Moulvi Dilwar Ali was the Deputy Collector. =Assam Province (1874‚Äì1905, 1912‚Äì1947)= 250px Despite protests to the Viceroy from its Bengali-majority population, Sylhet was made part of the non-regulation Chief Commissioner's Province of Assam (Northeast Frontier Province) in September 1874 in order to facilitate Assam's commercial development. A memorandum of protest against the transfer of Sylhet was submitted to the viceroy on 10 August 1874 by leaders of both the Hindu and Muslim communities. The protests subsided when the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, visited Sylhet to reassure the people that education and justice would be administered from Bengal, and when the Sylheti people saw the opportunity of employment in tea estates in Assam and a market for their produce. The Assam Bengal Railway was established in 1892 to connect Assam and Sylhet with the port city of Chittagong and also served as a lifeline for the tea industry, transporting tea to exporters in the Port of Chittagong. The first college in the region, Murari Chand College, was opened in 1892. The region was heavily affected during the 1897 Assam earthquake resulting in many deaths and the damage of many buildings as well as the Assam-Bengal Railway. In 1903, snakes killed 75 people, wild pigs killed 2 people and a tiger killed one person. In 1905, Sylhet was reincorporated into the Surma Valley Division in Eastern Bengal and Assam after the first partition of Bengal. However this was short-lasted as in 1912, it was again separated from Bengal when Assam was reconstituted into a chief commissioners' province.William Cooke Taylor, A Popular History of British India. p. 505 By the 1920s, organizations such as the Sylhet Peoples' Association and Sylhet-Bengal Reunion League (1920) mobilized public opinion demanding the division's incorporation into Bengal. However, the leaders of the Reunion League, including Muhammad Bakht Mauzumdar and Syed Abdul Majid, later opposed the transfer of Sylhet and Cachar to Bengal during the Surma Valley Muslim Conference of September 1928. This was supported by the Anjuman- e-Islamia and Muslim Students Association. Due to the size of Sylhet's Bengali Muslim majority, the All India Muslim League formed the first elected government in British Assam. The numbers of lascars grew between the two world wars, with some ending up in the docks of London and Liverpool. During World War II, many fought on the Allied front before settling down in the United Kingdom, where they opened cafes and restaurants which became important hubs for the British Asian community.Bengali speaking community in the Port of London PortCities London. Retrieved 28 May 2009. In 1946, Gopinath Bordoloi, the Prime Minister of British Assam brought forward his wish to hand over Sylhet back to East Bengal. Following a referendum, almost all of erstwhile district of Sylhet became a part of East Bengal in the Dominion of Pakistan. After being pleaded by a delegation led by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar, the Barak Valley districts were barred and incorporated into the Dominion of India. The referendum was held on 6 July 1947. 239,619 people voted to join East Bengal (i.e. part of Pakistan) and 184,041 voted to remain in Assam (i.e. part of India). The referendum was acknowledged by Article 3 of the Indian Independence Act 1947. =Eastern Bengal and Assam (1905‚Äì1912)= 250px In 1905, Sylhet was added to the Chief Commissioner's Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam as a result of the Partition of Bengal. The new region, now ruled by a Lt. Governor, had its capital at Dhaka. This province had a 15-member legislative council in which Assam had two seats. The members for these seats were recommended (not elected) by rotating groups of public bodies. The partition was strongly protested in Bengal, and the people of Assam were not happy either. Opposition to partition was co-ordinated by Indian National Congress, whose President was then Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton who had been Chief Commissioner of Assam until he retired in 1902. The partition was finally annulled by an imperial decree in 1911, announced by the King-Emperor at the Delhi Durbar.  Post-Partition of India  The Central Shaheed Minar in Sylhet In the early 20th century, during the British period, a labour exploitation system known as the \\"Nankar custom\\" was introduced and practiced by zamindars. This barbarous system was confronted by the local peasants of the region during the Nankar Rebellion, leading to six deaths. In Beanibazar, the rebellion was born and spread across East Pakistan leading the Pakistani government to abolish the zamindari system and repeal the non-governmental rule to recognize the ownership of the land of peasants. In 1952, the Pakistan Tea Board - a tea research station in Srimangal, Moulvibazar - was founded to support the production, certification and exportation of the tea trade.Bangladesh Tea Research Institute, Banglapedia =Post liberation from Pakistan= Shaheed Minar replica in Srimangal During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 for the liberation of Bangladesh, when Pakistan Army created the 39th ad hoc Division in mid-November, from the 14th Division units deployed in those areas, to hold on to the Comilla and Noakhali districts, and the 14th Division was tasked to defend the Sylhet and Brahmanbaria areas only.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp126 Sylhet was part of Sector 3, Sector 4 and Sector 5. Sector 3 was headed by K. M. Shafiullah and later A. N. M. Nuruzzaman at Hejamara. It was formed by 2 East Bengal and EPR troops of Sylhet and Mymensingh. The ten sub-sectors of this sector (and their commanders) were: Asrambari (Captain Aziz, later replaced by Captain Ejaz); Baghaibari (Captain Aziz, later replaced by Captain Ejaz); Hatkata (Captain Matiur Rahman); Simla (Captain Matin); Panchabati (Captain Nasim); Mantala (Captain MSA Bhuyan); Vijoynagar (Captain MSA Bhuyan); Kalachhara (Lieutenant Majumdar); Kalkalia (Lieutenant Golam Helal Morshed); and Bamutia (Lieutenant Sayeed). Sector 4 comprised from Habiganj to Kanaighat and had 4,000 EPR troops, and aided by 9,000 regular freedom fighters. They were commanded by Chitta Ranjan Dutta, and later Mohammad Abdur Rab. The headquarters of Sector 4 was initially at Karimganj and later at Masimpur in Assam. The six sub- sectors of this sector (and their commanders) were: Jalalpur (Masudur Rab Sadi); Barapunji (Mohammad Abdur Rab); Amlasid (Lieutenant Zahir); Kukital (Flight Lieutenant Kader, later replaced by Captain Shariful Haq); Kailas Shahar (Lieutenant Wakiuzzaman); and Kamalpur (Captain Enam). Sector 5 comprised from Durgapur to Tamabil and was commanded by Major Mir Shawkat Ali at Banshtala. The sector was composed of 800 regulars and 5000 guerillas. The six sub-sectors of this sector (and their commanders) were: Muktapur (Subedar Nazir Hossain, freedom fighter Faruq was second in command); Dauki (Subedar Major BR Chowdhury); Shela (Captain Helal, who had two assistant commanders, Lieutenant Mahbubar Rahman and Lieutenant Abdur Rauf); Bholaganj (Lieutenant Taheruddin Akhunji who had Lieutenant SM Khaled as assistant commander); Balat (Subedar Ghani, later replaced by Captain Salahuddin and Enamul Haq Chowdhury); and Barachhara (Captain Muslim Uddin). Amidst the war, many printing presses were damaged and this included the Sylheti Nagri script printed at the Islamia Press.BanglapediaArchive The region was a focal point of East Pakistan's Liberation War, which created Bangladesh. It was the hometown of General M. A. G. Osmani, the commander-in-chief of Bangladesh Forces and the Panchgaon Factory in Rajnagar Upazila produced cannons under his command. A famous historical cannon built by Janardan Karmakar remains in display in Dhaka. The Battle of Gazipur, in Kulaura, raged between the Pakistani military and the allied forces of Bangladesh and India from 4 to 5 December 1971. The battle ended with a Bangladeshi victory. The Battle of Sylhet took place from 7 to 15 December, eventually leading to a Pakistani surrender and the liberation of Sylhet. Pakistan Army's 93,000 troops unconditionally surrendered to the Indian Army and India's local ally Mukti Bahini on 16 December 1971.

The project develops utilities and documentation for more effective threat intelligence, by sharing indicators of compromise. There are several organizations who run MISP instances, who are listed on the website.  History  This project started around June 2011 when Christophe Vandeplas had a frustration that way too many Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were shared by email, or in pdf documents and were not parsable by automatic machines. So at home he started to play around with CakePHP and made a proof of concept of his idea. He called it CyDefSIG: Cyber Defence Signatures. Mid July 2011 he presented his personal project at work (Belgian Defence) where the feedback was rather positive. After giving access to CyDefSIG running on his personal server the Belgian Defence started to use CyDefSIG officially starting mid August 2011. Christophe was then allowed to spend some time on CyDefSIG during his work-hours, while still working on it at home. At some point NATO heard about this project. In January 2012 a first presentation was done to introduce them in more depth to the project. They looked at other products that the market offered, but it seemed they deemed the openness of CyDefSIG to be of a great advantage. Andrzej Dereszowski was the first part-time developer from NATO side. One thing led to another and some months later NATO hired a full- time developer to improve the code and add more features. A collaborative development started from that date. As with many personal projects the license was not explicitly written yet, it was collaboratively decided that the project would be released publicly under the Affero GPL license. This to share the code with as many people as possible and to protect it from any harm. The project was then renamed to MISP: Malware Information Sharing Project, a name invented by Alex Vandurme from NATO. In January 2013 Andras Iklody became the main full-time developer of MISP, during the day initially hired by NATO and during the evening and week-end contributor to an open source project. Meanwhile other organisations started to adopt the software and promoted it around the CERT world (CERT-EU, CIRCL, and many others). Nowadays, Andras Iklody is the lead developer of the MISP project and works for CIRCL. As the MISP project expanded, MISP is not only covering the malware indicators but also fraud or vulnerability information. The name is now MISP Threat Sharing, which includes the core MISP software and a myriad of tools (PyMISP) and format (core format, MISP taxonomies, warning-lists) to support MISP. MISP is now a community project lead by a team of volunteers. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution- ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.  Funding  The project is funded by the European Union (through the Connecting Europe Facility) and the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg.  Intelligence Integration  Indicators of compromise which are managed by MISP may originate from a variety of sources; including internal incident investigation teams, intelligence sharing partners or commercial intelligence sources. Commercial sources with integration to MISP include Symantec's DeepSight Intelligence, Kaspersky threat feeds and McAfee Active Response.

He was the main pilot of a de Havilland Gipsy Moth and was accompanied by 17-year-old Aspy Merwan Engineer, his co-pilot. The journey took 17 days. However, he did not win the competition as the rules stated that the flight needed to be completed solo. He was later commissioned into the equipment branch of the Indian Air Force, becoming its senior officer, before he retired in 1953.  Early life  Ram Nath Chawla was born 1 December 1903. After completing High School in Kasur, he studied civil engineering at the University of Nottingham and took flying lessons at the nearby Hucknall Aerodrome. In 1928, he received his flying licence from the Aero Club of London.  Early flying career  In November 1929, keen on promoting aviation, the Aga Khan, 48th Iman of the Ismailai sect of Muslims, announced a ¬£500 prize for the first Indian to fly solo between India and England, in either direction, within a one-month time frame. Unable to cover the cost of participating, Chawla teamed up with 17-year-old Aspy Merwan Engineer, who had recently received his flying licence and a de Havilland Gipsy Moth aircraft as a birthday gift. On 3 March 1930, with Chawla as the main pilot, they both flew the aircraft from Karachi, to Croydon Airport, England, taking 17 days. After losing their way a number of times, they were received at Croydon by a welcoming crowd and presented with garlands of flowers by the Mayor of London and rewarded with 7,500 rupees from the Indian government. Members of the Punjab Association and officials from the Air Ministry were also present. On 27 March 1930, The Wallington and Carshalton Times captured the arrival at Croydon with a photograph of both pilots and the headline \\"From India's coral strand\\". Under the image were the words \\"Victor‚Äôs laurels\\". A reception was held on 10 April 1930. Aspy Engineer shortly returned to Karachi and won the prize, beating J. R. D. Tata by a few hours and winning over Man Mohan Singh due to a technical issue. The 1965 Who's Who of Aviation Directory of Asia describes Chawla as \\"the first Indian to pilot an aircraft from Karachi to Croydon, UK in 1930\\".  Later flying career  In 1934, Chawla flew from India to England, solo, in a de Havilland Puss Moth. On 1 August 1940, following training at PAF Base Faisal, Karachi, he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force as an equipment officer. After the partition of India, Chawla became the senior most equipment officer in the Indian Air force. He retired as Wing Commander in 1953, having flown 960 hours as a civilian pilot. Death Chawla died on 23 February 1986.

Bionic leaves can be composed of both synthetic (metals, ceramics, polymers, etc.) and organic materials (bacteria), or solely made of synthetic materials. The Bionic Leaf has the potential to be implemented in communities, such as urbanized areas to provide clean air as well as providing needed clean energy.  History  In 2009 at MIT, Daniel Nocera's lab first developed the \\"artificial leaf\\", a device made from silicon and an anode electrocatalyst for the oxidation of water, capable of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. In 2012, Nocera came to Harvard and The Silver Lab of Harvard Medical School joined Nocera‚Äôs team. Together the teams expanded the existing technology to create the Bionic Leaf. It merged the concept of the artificial leaf with genetically engineered bacteria that feed on the hydrogen and convert CO2 in the air into alcohol fuels or chemicals. The first version of the teams Bionic Leaf was created in 2015 but the catalyst used was harmful to the bacteria. In 2016, a new catalyst was designed to solve this issue, named the \\"Bionic Leaf 2.0\\". Other versions of artificial leaves have been developed by the California Institute of Technology and the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, the University of Waterloo, and the University of Cambridge.  Mechanics  = Photosynthesis = Natural Photosynthesis vs. The Bionic Leaf at its simplest form. In natural photosynthesis, photosynthetic organisms produce energy-rich organic molecules from water and carbon dioxide by using solar radiation. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the air. Artificial photosynthesis, as performed by the Bionic Leaf, is approximately 10 times more efficient than natural photosynthesis. Using a catalyst, the Bionic Leaf can remove excess carbon dioxide in the air and convert that to useful alcohol fuels, like isopropanol and isobutanol. The efficiency of the Bionic Leaf's artificial photosynthesis is the result of bypassing obstacles in natural photosynthesis by virtue of its artificiality. In natural systems, there are numerous energy conversion bottlenecks that limit the overall efficiency of photosynthesis. As a result, most plants do not exceed 1% efficiency and even microalgae grown in bioreactors do not exceed 3%. Existing artificial photosynthetic solar-to-fuels cycles may exceed natural efficiencies but cannot complete the cycle via carbon fixation. When the catalysts of the Bionic Leaf are coupled with the bacterium Ralstonia eutropha, this results in a hybrid system capable of carbon dioxide fixation. This system can store more than half of its input energy as products of carbon dioxide fixation. Overall, the hybrid design allows for artificial photosynthesis with efficiencies rivaling that of natural photosynthesis. = Artificial Photosynthesis Systems = The Bionic Leaf is an artificial leaf that interfaces a triple-junction Si wafer with amorphous silicon photovoltaic with hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving catalysts made from a ternary alloy, nickel-molybdenum-zinc (NiMoZn) and a cobalt‚Äìphosphate cluster (Co-OEC). The Co-OEC is able to operate in natural water at room temperature. Accordingly, the Bionic Leaf can be immersed in water and when held up to sunlight, it can effect direct solar energy conversion via water-splitting. The Bionic Leaf, by virtue of the Co-OEC, also exhibits self-assembling and self-healing properties. The Co-OEC self-assembles upon oxidation of an earth metal ion from 2+ to 3+. It also self-heals upon application of a potential, wherein the cluster reforms due to equilibrium between aqueous cobalt and phosphate. The Bionic Leaf can be used in artificial photosynthetic systems. One such system is a hybrid water-splitting-biosynthetic system that can operate at low driving voltages. The catalyst system of the Bionic Leaf is used in conjunction with bacterium Ralstonia eutropha. The bacterium is grown in contact with the catalysts and then consumes the produced H2 from the water- splitting reaction. After consumption, the bacterium synthesizes biomass and fuels or chemical products from low CO2 concentration in the presence of O2. The usage of the bacterium requires a biocompatible catalyst system that is not toxic to the bacterium and that lowers the overpotential for water splitting. The original catalyst used, the nickel-molybdenum-zinc (NiMoZn) alloy, poisoned the microbes by destroying the bacteria's DNA. Accordingly, this hybrid system uses a cobalt-phosphorus (Co-P) alloy cathode that is resistant to reactive oxygen species. This in return leaves no excess metal and does not form oxygen radicals, leaving the microbes and DNA unharmed. This alloy drives the hydrogen evolution reaction while a cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) anode drives the oxygen evolution reaction. This new catalyst can run up to 16 days at a time when compared to the nickel-molybdenum-zinc (NiMoZn) alloy.  Applications  = Agriculture = Early results from Dan Nocera, a researcher at Harvard University, gave insight on how his newly created bionic leaf can be used for fertilizer production. This new bionic leaf uses photovoltaic cells in conjunction with Xanthobacter autotrophicus bacteria to create a plastic called polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). PHB supplies energy to the bacteria's natural enzymes which then converts nitrogen gas from the air into ammonia. The bionic leaf, can perform this process using renewable electricity, allowing for the sustainable production of ammonia and bio- fertilizers. Currently, the main industrial production of ammonia is performed by what is known as the Haber-Bosch Process, which uses natural gas as the main energy source. The bacteria within the bionic leaf also help to remove carbon dioxide from the environment. The bionic leaf must still pass an environmental impact study in order to determine if this bacteria is safe to release into the wild. Although the bionic leaf currently operates at a mere 25% efficiency, research and development is still with the hopes of improving the process. X. autotrophicus cells act as a living bio-fertilizer due to their ability to directly promote plant growth when applied to organic material. A study was conducted by comparing plants treated with no fertilizer to the same treated with increasing amounts of X. autotrophicus culture. The treated plants root mass and total mass increased by approximately 130% and 100% respectively, compared to that of the untreated control group. = Atmosphere = Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, traps heat in the atmosphere, the bionic leaf can potentially be used to reduce the carbon dioxide within the atmosphere. While the bionic leaf is running mimics photosynthesis by converting the carbon dioxide in air into fuels. The bionic leaf can eliminate 180 grams of carbon dioxide out of 230,000 liters of air for each kilowatt hour of energy it consumes. While removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere not possible yet on a large scale, this technology is useful in areas where carbon dioxide is produced such as power plants. It can also be implemented within urban areas, providing clean air to the area. The technology may also be used on a smaller scale, helping communities produce, harness, and consume the require energy they need. = Bionic Facades = Example of a natural vertical greenery system (green wall) on a building's exterior wall. Bionic leaves have been considered as an alternative to vertical greenery systems (VGS), also known as green facades. Like VGS, bionic facades can be implemented in buildings to reduce energy consumption from cooling, absorb solar radiation, and reduce CO2 emissions. Unlike their natural counterpart, bionic facades require less costly maintenance (irrigation, fertilization, pest-control) and can be potentially adjusted to external conditions like the changing of seasons. The general structure of the bionic leaves used for these experiments can be characterized as a photovoltaic (PV) cell or plate resistive heater backed with a ceramic evaporative matrix. An experiment comparing the performance of a PV panel alone versus the bionic leaf panel showed increased electricity production of up to 6.6% due to the evaporative cooling from the matrix. The bionic facade also had a comparable effect on lowering the ambient temperature at the building-to-air interface as a green facade planted with ivy. The cooling effect paired with the electricity output of the bionic facade showed a CO2 emissions reduction that was 25 times greater than the daily average CO2 consumption of the ivy wall.

Mehta of E4 Entertainment. It is a remake of the 2017 Telugu film Arjun Reddy. The film stars Dhruv Vikram and Megha Chowdhury. Filmed between March and September 2018, its release was initially cancelled after E4 Entertainment was unsatisfied with the output and re-shot the remake in 2019 as Adithya Varma with a largely different cast and crew. Despite E4's initial refusal to release Varmaa, the film was released on 6 October 2020 on over-the-top (OTT) platforms to negative reviews from critics.  Plot  Varmaa Vasudevan is a house surgeon. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe anger management problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Varmaa's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a college bully. After a brawl alongside his friend Kamal against members of the opposing team during an inter-college football match, the dean asks Varmaa to either apologise or leave the college. Varmaa initially chooses to leave the college but stays back after meeting the first-year student Megha. Varmaa and his friend Ashok enter a 1st-year classroom and announce that Varmaa is in love with Megha and asserts that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Megha starts adjusting to Varmaa's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings and they develop an intimate relationship. Varmaa graduates with an MBBS degree and leaves to pursue a Master's degree in orthopaedic surgery. Over the course of 15 days, Varmaa's and Megha's relationship becomes stronger. Days later, Varmaa visits Megha's house, where her father sees them kissing and throws Varmaa out. Megha's father opposes her and Varmaa's relationship due to Varmaa's brash behaviour and also because they belong to different castes. Varmaa demands Megha decide within six hours otherwise he will end their relationship. Following this incident, Megha's parents seize her phone, preventing her from contacting Varma. By the time she manages to visit Varmaa's house, he is drunk, injects morphine into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days. Megha is then forcibly married to someone from her caste. Varmaa learns about the marriage from Ashok and goes to her house. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Varmaa's father throws him out of the family home for ruining his reputation. With Ashok's help, Varmaa rents a flat and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts one-night stands, buys a pet dog, and names it after Megha and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high- functioning alcoholic who is feared by the hospital's staff members, one of the reasons being his high surgery count. Varmaa's self-destructing behaviour and refusal to move on worries Ashok. He persuades one of his patients, Raiza Wilson, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him. On a day off, Varmaa unwillingly agrees to perform life-saving surgery and collapses from dehydration. The hospital staff examines his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and cocaine. The hospital chief files a case against Varma, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Ashok making arrangements to bail him out. Varmaa's medical licence is cancelled for five years and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Ashok manages to reach Varmaa to convey his father's death; he and they reconcile. Varmaa gives up his self-destructive habits soon after. While leaving for a vacation, Varmaa sees a pregnant Megha sitting in a park. Convinced that she is unhappy with her marriage, Varmaa meets her after returning from his vacation. Megha reveals that she left her husband days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Varmaa that he is the child's father, and they reunite.

The following month, Bala was chosen to direct the yet-untitled Tamil remake. On 10 November 2017, the title was announced as Varma, although it would later be amended to Varmaa. Raju Murugan was chosen to write the dialogues. M. Sukumar was selected to handle the cinematography. Producer Mukesh R. Mehta said the remake would be 20 minutes shorter than Arjun Reddy. Sathish Suriya was chosen as the editor, after having earlier worked for Bala's Naachiyaar (2018). Actor Vikram's son Dhruv was cast as the male lead, in what would have been his acting debut. It is the Tamil debut for the Kolkata-based model Megha Chowdhury, who plays the female lead. = Filming = Principal photography began in early March 2018 at Kathmandu, Nepal, and a week later, after completing the first schedule there, the crew shifted to Chennai for the second schedule. Shooting was briefly stalled due to a strike of the Tamil Film Producers Council, but resumed in April after the strike ended. For the final schedule, the team shifted to Tiruvannamalai. Principal photography wrapped in mid-September 2018. On 7 February 2019, E4 issued a press statement stating that they would go for a complete reshoot as they were not satisfied with the final cut provided by Bala. Bala's version of the film contained deviations from Arjun Reddy, which resulted in the conflict. Changes included the absence of many characters from Arjun Reddy, including the male lead's grandmother. Varmaa was also two hours long while E4 wanted it to have a runtime of three hours like the original. In their press statement, E4 added that the film would be relaunched with a completely new cast and crew while retaining Dhruv. In a separate press statement, Bala decried E4's comments, saying it was his own decision to quit the film \\"in order to safeguard creative freedom\\" because he was asked to make changes. This became the first such incident in Tamil cinema that the producer of the film refuses to release the film due to unsatisfactory final cut despite the completion of the film. The new version, directed by Gireesaaya, was titled Adithya Varma, and did not retain any scene shot by Bala for Varmaa.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Radhan. The song \\"Vaanodum Mannodum\\", written by Vairamuthu and sung by Vignesh G., was released on 27 December 2018 as a single.  Marketing  The teaser for Varmaa was released on 23 September 2018. It was widely ridiculed and criticised on social media, while a critic from The New Indian Express called it \\"a failed attempt to remake the original\\". The teaser received five million views within fifty hours of release. The trailer was released on 9 January 2019.  Release  When Varmaa was scheduled for a theatrical release in January 2019, Shakthi Film Factory acquired the Tamil Nadu distribution rights. Despite E4's initial refusal to release it, after more than a year of deadlock, the film was released on 6 October 2020 on over- the-top (OTT) platforms. It was released on Simply South and Tentkotta internationally, and within India on The Ally, Shreyas ET and ShemarooMe. The decision to release an alternate version of a film was compared to the announcement of Zack Snyder's Justice League, a director's cut of Justice League (2017).  Reception  Varmaa received generally negative reviews from critics, many of whom compared it unfavourably to Adithya Varma. M. Suganth of The Times of India rated the film 2 stars out of 5, saying, \\"Instead of feeling new age-y, Varmaa comes across as old-fashioned and even crass at times. It gets Arjun Reddy all wrong.\\" Suganth also felt many of the actors like Chowdhury were miscast and criticised the lack of onscreen chemistry between her and Dhruv. He concluded that Dhruv looks \\"sure-footed in some scenes and like a novice in some\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote, \\"Not a single frame is distinctive, or shows that a major filmmaker is behind the camera. You get the feeling Bala was forced to direct this with his hands tied.\\" Ranjani Krishnakumar of Firstpost wrote, \\"Varmaa is not rooted anywhere. The milieu does nothing for the film. Varma‚Äôs pain, which is what made Arjun Reddy intense, is heavily diluted. In fact, for the most part, he is just your average alcoholic, only too pampered.\\" Manoj Kumar R of The Indian Express wrote, \\"After watching Varmaa, I could see why the producer thought it was not a good idea to release it in theaters. Bala's interpretation of Sandeep Vanga's material strips the larger-than-life aura around the self-indulgent, inconsiderate, alcoholic and self-destructive protagonist.\\" However, he concluded that the film \\"is a unique, honest and bold interpretation of a character that we all love despite the breathtaking level of faultiness.\\" Srivatsan S. of The Hindu wrote that \\"But the Bala Cut, as it would come to be known, is surprisingly cold and lifeless ‚Äî even by the standards set by Adithya Varma ‚Äî and edits out the dramatic bits of the Telugu original, only limiting to its plot points\\" and stated that the film was a \\"reinterpretation to his own Sethu\\". Sudhir Srinivasan of Cinema Express gave the film a rating of one-and-a-half out of five stars and noted that \\"What would the Bala of today change about/add to this story that‚Äôs been told so many times now that you can predict its every beat? Well, it turns out that he hasn‚Äôt. He has settled to giving us a jaded, curtailed version instead\\".

It is responsible for identifying parts of faces, such as eyes, nose, and mouth.  Function  It is the least understood face-selective region within the brain and is implicated in the network responsible for the ability to recognize faces, the Ventral Occipital Temporal system. The OFA acts as the first stage in a distributed, hierarchical network for face computations of increasing complexity, such as face identification and discrimination of facial expressions - which are performed at higher levels of the cortex. Studies using high temporal resolution demonstrated that the OFA is able to process face information approximately 100 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus, making it the first face-selective cortical region to respond to facial stimuli. Neuropsychological studies of patients with acquired prosopagnosia and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies of healthy participants show that the OFA is functionally necessary for some face computations. They also suggest the existence of connections between the early visual cortex and the fusiform face area (FFA) that bypass the OFA. However, the OFA remains an essential part of the face perception network and represents face parts prior to further processing of more complex facial features in higher face-selective cortical regions. The OFA is frequently found within the right hemisphere, located on the lateral surface of the occipital lobe either in or around the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). The location of the OFA varies spatially between people. Group peak Talairach coordinates place the OFA in Brodmann area 18 or 19.  Research  = Patient P.S. = Examining case studies of individuals with OFA lesions provides more insight into its function. Prosopagnosic patients have been essential for this initiative, especially patient P.S., a right handed woman with a lesion extending from the posterior part of the right inferior occipital gyrus into the posterior fusiform gyrus. This lesion left patient P.S. without a right OFA and she exhibited great difficulty with facial recognition in daily life. Additionally, she had trouble with facial gender discrimination and could not match unfamiliar faces seen from different viewing angles. Despite the extensive cortical damage she suffered, patient P.S. exhibited a normal right fusiform face area when compared to age matched controls using a standard fMRI localizer. She was unimpaired with basic-level and within-class object discrimination and recognition tasks. Results like these demonstrate that face information can still be processed in the right FFA despite the absence of the right OFA, thus suggesting the presence of alternate cortical routes between the early visual cortex and fusiform gyrus.

She was one of the first Austrian artists to combine computers and photography. Her works reflect the avant-garde culture of the 1960s and 1970s in their experimental techniques and performative aspects. Her work received renewed attention in the 2010s. Pilz's photographs have been described as \\"one-second sculptures\\" or \\"flash-sculptures\\". She often chooses feminist approaches, addressing taboos, stereotyping, and environmental concerns. In this regard, her work has been compared to that of Valie Export. Much of her work is autobiographical. She has received a number of awards, including the Theodor K√∂rner Prize (1990). Biography Pilz was born in 1936 in Haarlem in the Netherlands. In 1939, when she was three years old, her family fled from the National Socialists to Semarang in Central Java, Indonesia. When the Japanese invaded Indonesia in March 1942, Pilz's father was sent to a concentration camp in Sumatra. She and her mother spent two years among 8,000 prisoners in Lampersari concentration camp, Semarang, Central Java. In Pilz's case, seven women and two children lived in a tiny filthy room. They suffered from typhus and one of Pilz's legs became infected and as a result is shorter than the other. In 1954 Pilz went to Vienna to study photography at the H√∂heren Graphischen Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalt, the Federal Training and Research Institute of Graphic Arts. She worked with Hans Weiss as a commercial photographer in Vienna from 1971 to 1978. In 1976, she received her Meisterpr√ºfung (master's certification) in photography. Pilz was strongly affected by her arrest by plainclothes police officers at the Third Women's Festival in Vienna on April 14, 1978. She addressed these events through the creation of a body-centered series of self-portraits, communicating emotion to the audience both through expressive gestures and through the state of the linen jacket that she wore at the time of the arrest. These photographs, in which she is portrayed with crumpled clothes and in crouched postures, have been described as \\"one-second sculptures\\" or \\"flash-sculptures\\". In 1978 Pilz also joined the feminist artists network Internationalen Aktionsgemeinschaft bildender K√ºnstlerinnen (International Action Community of Fine Artists, IntAkt). Her work is closely related to the feminist movement of the 1970s and 1980s. In her work she explored and reflected on the institution of marriage, working conditions of women, and the social role of women. For example, for the work \\"Arbeiterinnenaltar\\" (Workers altar, 1981), she photographed workers at the coffee roastery Eduscho and questioned working conditions. Her photo sequence, The White Cell Project (1983-1985), placed her subjects within a small cardboard room, 165 centimeters wide, that concretized the weight and constraint of societal expectations and norms. She invited other artists to create works within the White Cell, including , , and Liesbeth Waechter-B√∂hm. Pilz was a pioneer in media art in Austria. A well-known early work by Pilz was her intervention in a public space Kaorle am Karlsplatz (1982), for which she poured sand on the Karlsplatz in Vienna during the Wiener Festwochen (Vienna Festival) and had sun loungers set up. In 1991 Pilz created Delphi Digital, together with Roland Alton-Scheidl, for the Ars Electronica in Linz. The interactive digital installation engaged visitors in questioning environmental policy and democracy. An updated version using smartphones was exhibited in 2015-2016. From 1990 to 1992 Pilz worked as a lecturer at the Technischen Universit√§t Wien (Vienna University of Technology). In 1991 she was a visiting professor at Pandios Universit√§t Athen, and from 1993 to 1994 she worked at Technischen Universit√§t Graz. Pilz has donated many of her early works to the city of Vienna, including 2,000 prints and 10,000 negatives from the 1970s to the 1990s. A retrospective of her work, Meilensteine (Milestone) was shown in Vienna in 2015, and her work is part of internationally shown exhibits on The Feminist Avant-Garde of the 1970s (2016-2018). In 2018, Margot Pilz was one of five women featured in Sie ist der andere Blick (She is the other gaze), a documentary film created by Christiana Perschon and artist Iris Dostal. The film focuses on feminist artists of the 1970s who were part of the Viennese art scene. The film examines the ways in which their artistic practice and their feminism interact, as they recall challenges and obstacles that they faced and how they overcame them in both personal and political spaces. The other women filmed are Renate Bertlmann, , , and . The film won a 2018 Theodor K√∂rner Prize.

Biography Born in Indianapolis, Gillette was raised in Peoria, Illinois and then Chicago in the 1920s. He began singing and playing drums in local bands, often alongside his friend Ken Nelson with whom he formed a vocal trio, the Campus Kids. He joined the orchestra for the radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, moving in 1939 to Hollywood, where he met Glenn Wallichs, who recorded the show on transcription discs. Gillette went back to Chicago to work in radio, but, after Wallichs co-founded Capitol Records in 1942, Gillette returned to California to head its country music artists and repertoire section. Rich Kienzle, \\"The Kid from Chicago: Lee Gillette\\", in Southwest Shuffle, Routledge, 2013The Encyclopedia of Country Music, Oxford University Press, 2012 Gillette signed, and then worked as the producer for, most of Capitol's country stars in the immediate post-war period, including Tex Ritter, Jack Guthrie, Jimmy Wakely, Merle Travis, Tex Williams and Tennessee Ernie Ford, regularly using jazz musicians and horn sections on country and pop-oriented recordings. In 1950, Gillette moved to the company's pop music division, continuing to produce Ford but becoming increasingly associated with Nat King Cole, whose records Gillette produced from the early 1950s until Cole's death in 1965. Other musicians with whom Gillette worked at Capitol included Georgia Gibbs, Dean Martin, Peggy Lee, Joe \\"Fingers\\" Carr, Nelson Riddle, Stan Kenton, and Vic Damone. Gillette also composed songs with Carr (real name Lou Busch). Dave Dexter Jr., \\"Memorial Rites Held For Leland Gillette\\", Billboard, 5 September 1981, p.68 Gillette co-founded the music publishing company Central Songs, and helped organize the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). After Cole's death, Gillette suffered from depression and retired shortly afterwards, spending much of his later years travelling the world with his wife. He only occasionally undertook production duties thereafter, notably with Alvino Rey. He died at his home in California in 1981, aged 68.

Work  Two main guidelines are outlined in the work of Jacques Halbert since his years of studies at the Beaux-Arts in Bourges, performance art and painting. A notable collector of Halbert's work is Brian Johnson. = Performance art = In 1976, during the construction of the Centre Georges Pompidou, he creates a Centre Pompidou-Cake, which he cuts and shares, on the forecourt of the museum, with his artist friends and passers-by unofficially invited to this performance. The same year at the invitation of Henri Jobb√©- Duval (director of the FIAC), he transforms a scooter into Gallery Cerise, a traveling sculpture with which he rides the aisles of the FIAC in 1976 and 1977.

Initially working as a school teacher after briefly serving with the Royal Navy in the latter years of the Second World War, Haggett joined the RAF to play for the Royal Air Force cricket team, following the recommendation of a squadron leader. His career with the RAF saw him become a member of the RAF Falcons parachute display team. After leaving the RAF in 1981, he returned to teaching, only retiring aged 91 in 2017. Early life and Royal Air Force The son of a butcher, Haggett was born at Lee, London, on 8 July 1926. He was educated at The John Roan School, but was evacuated during the start of the Second World War to a family in Wales. He served in the Royal Navy during the final year or two of the war. Following the end of the war, he left the navy and trained as a physical education teacher at St. Pauls, Cheltenham. Shortly after completing his training he returned to London and taught at his old school. It was here that he was introduced to his wife, Beryl, who was a student at Goldsmiths College. The couple married in 1953 and moved to Bromley. A keen cricketer, Haggett's skills were spotted by a wing commander in the Royal Air Force (RAF), who encouraged him to sign up so he could play for the Royal Air Force cricket team. Following the suggestion, he enlisted in the RAF as a flying officer in the Physical Fitness Branch in August 1956, with promotion to flight lieutenant coming in August 1960. He moved about with his wife, and by this point daughter, living in Abingdon and Boscombe Down, with a son following. He played first-class cricket for the Combined Services cricket team, playing two matches against Cambridge University and Ireland in 1962, followed up by two further appearances in 1964 against Cambridge University and Oxford University. He scored 204 runs across his four matches, with a high score of 71 and a batting average of 25.50. He also played minor matches for the RAF, including one match against an LC Stevens' XI featuring Gary Sobers; during the match Sobers was caught by Haggett off the bowling of Tony Buss. Haggett was promoted to squadron leader in December 1967. He was a parachute instructor at the Parachute Training School at RAF Brize Norton, teaching Charles, Prince of Wales to jump. His role also included testing new parachute designs, with the failure of one such parachute leaving him with serious injuries. Nevertheless, he recovered and became a member of the RAF Falcons display team. Haggett retired from the RAF in 1981, at which point he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1981 Birthday Honours. Later life After retiring Haggett continued his association with the RAF as a liaison officer, before switching back to teaching. He taught math and cricket at Cothill House in Oxfordshire, before joining Radley College on a voluntary basis in 1996 to coach cricket; his wife had been teaching at Radley since 1974. He soon moved back into the classroom, teaching history, before returning to math. He finally retired from teaching at Radley in 2017, aged 91 and just months before his death. In later life, Haggett was the chairman of the West Oxfordshire Conservative Party and was a keen gardener. He died at Oxford on 22 February 2018, and was survived by his wife and two children.

Biography He was the son of Andreas Adolph Freiherr von Krufft (1721-1793, civil servant) and his wife Maria Anna (). (Freiherr is a hereditary title, of similar status to the English baron.) He was educated at home, in training for government service. His mother was an excellent pianist, and a connoisseur and friend of classical music, and was his first music teacher. His sister Justina (1775-1832) was a talented poet and musician; his sister Catton was a poet also; his younger brother, Joseph, was a judge. From 1794 to 1800, Nikolaus studied philosophy and law at the University of Vienna. In 1801, he took employment at the Geheime Hof- und Staatskanzlei ('Secret Court and State Chancellery') (where his father also worked). In 1815, he was elevated to the rank of Staatskanzleirat ('State Counsel'). He was in close contact with Prince Metternich (1773-1859, Austrian diplomat), and was in his retinue when he visited Paris in 1815 to negotiate the Second Treaty of Paris after the final downfall of Napoleon. He accompanied the Prince during his visits to Italy in June 1817 and to Styria in October 1817. He was awarded medals by Alexander Tsar of Russia and Ferdinand King of Sicily, perhaps as part of the general enthusiasm for awarding decorations among the former allies which followed the fall of the First French Empire. His great love was music. He started composing at an early age. He took lessons from Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (1736-1809, composer, organist, and music theorist) in counterpoint and composition. He devoted much of his leisure to musical studies and to composition. His first collection of songs was published in 1798, when he was nineteen. He was a co- founder of the Wiener Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung. The connoisseur Gassner judged that his works showed spirit, intellect, and taste. The Austrian-born French composer and publisher Pleyel (1757-1831) praised his 24 Preludes and Fugues as original, masterly in counterpoint, technically challenging, and distinguished among works of their kind. Krufft thought them his best work, and dedicated them to Archduke Rudolf (1788-1831, cardinal, patron of the arts, friend of Beethoven). Austrian musicologist Theophil Antonicek (1937-2014) thought that the piano works and lieder were the highlights of his output, with the 24 Preludes and Fugues looking back to Bach, and the lieder being important forerunners to Schubert. His official cause of death was overwork, but it has been conjectured he might have been suffering from the ailment which claimed the life of Schubert (i.e., syphilis). By the end of his life, he found the sound of the piano unbearable. Compositions His compositions include: =Piano works= Seven piano sonatas; Op. 4 in D minor, in four movements (Vienna 1803), was dedicated to Beethoven * Twenty- four preludes and fugues for piano in the twelve major and minor keys (Pleyel, Paris 1814) * Three grand caprices for piano * Twelve exercises in the form of Scottish dances * Forty German dances * Eighteen Scottish dances * Grand sonata for piano four hands * March for piano four hands =Vocal works= Ninety-two lieder, some for soprano, some for bass, with piano accompaniment.

The lower leaves are opposite and the higher leaves alternate. The bloated involucre consists of very broad, hairless bracts. These protect up to ten, short, bluish ray florets that encircle yellow, partly sterile disc florets. The heads sit individually on top of up to long stalks. The species was considered extinct after no observations were made after 1915, but was rediscovered in the 21st century. It occurs in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Felicia annectens is an annual, branched or unbranched, tender herbaceous plant of up to high. Its leaves are set oppositely lower on the stem and alternately higher on the stem. They carry some bristly hairs, are inverted lance-shaped, up to 2 cm (0.87 in) long and wide, with an indistinct stalk, a pointy tip, and has an entire margin or rarely a few indistinct teeth. The flower heads are individually set on top of an up to long stalk. The involucre is up to in diameter and consists of a double row of blunt long, almost hairless bracts, with a broad papery margin, which are often flushed red. The outer bracts are elliptical and about wide. The inner bracts are broadly elliptic to inverted egg-shaped and about wide. Each flower head has about ten ray florets with bluish staps of about long and wide with some hairs at the base. These encircle numerous disc florets, which are partly sterile, partly fertile, and have an up to long yellow corolla. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a triangular appendage. Pappus is missing at the ray florets, but surrounding the base of the corolla of the disc florets are six to eight, up to 2 mm (0.1 in) long, quickly shunted pappus bristles. The eventually brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae of the fertile florets are broadly inverted egg-shaped in outline, about long and wide, with a pronounced ridge along the margin, with sturdy blunt hairs. The cypselae of sterile flowers are stunted and hairless. = Differences with related species = Felicia annectens is most related to Felicia bergeriana, but differs by the alternate leaves in the upper part of the stem, the very broad, hairless involucral bracts, and the fact that part of the disc florets are functionally, but not morphologically sterile.  Taxonomy  William Henry Harvey was the first to describe this species in 1865, based on a specimen he had collected himself near Paarl in 1838, and called it Aster annectens. J√ºrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae) reassigned it to the genus Felicia, making the combination Felicia annectens. The species is considered to be part of the section Neodetris.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Felicia annectens was known in the 19th century from only five observations from Hopefield in the north, the northwest of the Cape Peninsula, near Paarl, and along the Sonderend River near Caledon. In the 21st century it was rediscovered in the upper Breede River valley west of Worcester.  Conservation  The conservation status of Felicia annectens could not established in 2018 because there were too few data available. Science assumed it had gone extinct because no observations after 1915 had been made. A few observations were made in the 21st century however.

In 1839, Joseph G.R. Blackwell, a wealthy businessman, constructed this stone structure to house his general store, located facing what was then the town's small public square. It was later used to house the town's post office, a use which continued until 1894, By that time, Jackson was large enough to have outgrown the small building, and the Stone Post Office was abandoned in favor of a larger structure built with federal financing. The commercial center of Jackson was also growing, and larger structures were built around the old Stone Post Office, relegating it to the rear of other buildings. Since that time, it has mostly been used as a warehouse for a series of downtown businesses. Description The old Stone Post Office is a two-story sandstone structure.

More broadly, it is an analogy for supposedly insuperable extrapolated problems being rendered moot by the introduction of new technologies. The phrase originates from a 2004 article by Stephen Davies entitled \\"The Great Horse-Manure Crisis of 1894\\". also in the FEE's Sept. 2004 print magazine The Freeman according to: The supposed problem of excessive horse-manure collecting in the streets was solved by the proliferation of cars which replaced horses as the means of transportation in big cities. The term great horse manure crisis of 1894 is often used to denote a problem which seems to be impossible to solve because it is being looked at from the wrong direction. The name refers to a supposed 1894 publication in The Times, which said \\"In 50 years, every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure\\". The reasoning was that more horses are needed to remove the manure, and these horses produce more manure. An urban planning conference in 1898 supposedly broke up before its scheduled end due to a failure to find an answer to this problem. No such statement in the Times, nor conference result, is known, but in 1893 London there was a complaint that horse manure, formerly an economic good that could be sold, had become a disposal problem, an economic bad. The supposed crisis has since taken on life as a useful analogy.

The galley has a sink, plus an ice box used as a companionway step. A stove was a factory option. The portable head is located just aft of the \\"V\\"-berth and has a curtain for privacy. The boat has internally mast-mounted halyards, spinnaker- pole lift and outhaul, plus an internally-mounted reefing system. The 4:1 mainsheet traveler is mounted in the middle of the cockpit. A boom vang and Cunningham are standard equipment. The jib is controlled by two blocks on rails and two cockpit-mounted winches. Two additional winches are mounted on the cockpit roof got the halyards. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 171 with a high of 185 and low of 165. It has a hull speed of . Operational history Richard Sherwood, described the design, \\"the accent is on racing rather than cruising. Wetted surface is low, lines aft are flat, the keel and rudder are high aspect. She planes.\\" The Spinnaker Sailing Club of Redwood City, California has a fleet of 15 Merit 25s. They describe the boats as, \\"a solidly built 25-foot sloop that seats five comfortably in a self- draining cockpit. Despite relatively simple control systems, the Merit has the durability and flexibility for comfortable, all-season sailing in the Bay Area, where typical wind speeds can range from near zero to above 25 knots.\\" See alsoList of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Beachcomber 25 *Bayfield 25 *Bombardier 7.6 *Cal 25 *Cal 2-25 *C&C; 25 *Capri 25 *Catalina 25 *Catalina 250 *Com-Pac 25 *Dufour 1800 *Freedom 25 *Hunter 25.5 *J/24 *Jou√´t 760 *Kelt 7.6 *Kirby 25 *MacGregor 25 *Mirage 25 *Northern 25 *O'Day 25 *Redline 25 *Tanzer 25 *Sirius 26 *US Yachts US 25 *Watkins 25 References Keelboats 1970s sailboat type designs Sailing yachts ","title":"Merit 25"},{"id":"60019319","text":"Simone Mayer Simone Mayer (n√©e Bloch) (May 18, 1920-2006) was a French hematologist and author. Early life Simone Mayer was born in Metz, Moselle. Simone and her father were saved from deportation during the Second World War. Father Antoine Girardin, a priest, hid her and her father from the authorities in his presbytery. They were not allowed to leave their room for any reason, nor make noise that could give them away. Career After the war, Mayer practiced medicine at \\"Medical Clinic A\\" at the Strasbourg Hospital, which was devoted to internal medicine. A photo from 1946 shows she was part of a small female complement at Clinic A (composed mostly of males and Catholic nuns). Her doctoral thesis was presented to the Faculty of Medicine, Strasbourg in 1951, describing oxysteroids. She served as chair of the Hematology Department at the H√¥pitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, where she was a student of Robert Waitz. Along with Nobel Prize winner Jean Dausset, she helped establish a histocompatibility laboratory at the CRTS Centre R√©gional de Transfusion Sanguine (\\"Regional Center for Blood Transfusion\\"), which led to the development of bone marrow and organ transplantation at University of Strasbourg Hospitals. She was named director of the CRTS Strasbourg in 1976. From 1978 to 1986, Mayer relocated the Plasma Fractionation Center to Lingolsheim.

From 1964 to 2019, he published The Democrat-Reporter, a small weekly newspaper in Linden, Alabama. Sutton was widely celebrated in 1998 for publishing over four years a series of articles that exposed corruption in the Marengo County Sheriff's Office; he received awards and commendations and was suggested as a candidate for the Pulitzer Prize. In 2019, Sutton once again became the focus of national attention when he wrote and published an editorial suggesting the Ku Klux Klan be revived to \\"clean out\\" Washington, D.C. He already had a local reputation for other, similarly inflammatory racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and homophobic editorials. Personal life and career Howard Goodloe Sutton was born in Alabama in 1939, the son of Robert E. Sutton and Lorie Chrietzburg Sutton. His father was the editor of The Democrat-Reporter newspaper and bought it in 1917. Goodloe Sutton graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi and was editor of the school's student newspaper, Student Printz. It was there he met his future wife, Jean Rodgers; they married in 1964 and had two sons, Howard Goodloe Sutton, Jr. and William Robert Sutton. Prior to taking over the family newspaper, the couple \\"founded and owned several local newspapers in Demopolis, Camden, Thomasville, and Sumter County, Alabama.\\" Sutton returned to his hometown and purchased The Democrat-Reporter from his father in 1964, taking over as editor and publisher. His wife soon joined him as an investigative reporter, later Managing Editor, at the paper. Jean died in 2003 after complications related to cancer, leaving Sutton feeling \\"like a zombie\\" and not knowing \\"what to do\\", for several years afterwards. Corruption expos√©s In 1998, Sutton received widespread acclaim for articles exposing corruption in the Marengo County Sheriff's Office; he always credited his wife, Jean, \\"with laboring over courthouse records\\". These articles, many written by his wife, led to guilty pleas by Sheriff Roger Davis for extortion, soliciting a bribe, and failure to pay state income taxes on the extorted money, for which he received two concurrent 27-month sentences. For the series of articles with accompanying documentation Sutton was threatened; the Sheriff, according to Sutton, \\"started telling anyone who would listen that my oldest son was involved in drugs, my wife was having affairs and I was drunk all the time.\\" He received death threats and lost circulation and $50,000 per year in advertising in his newspaper; a local church official told him to \\"lay off the sheriff\\". A deputy, Wilmer \\"Sonny\\" Breckenridge, threatened to plant drugs in Sutton's home, according to Sutton. He and his wife were randomly pulled over and harassed, as was their oldest son. Their articles led to a federal undercover investigation, which in turn led to the arrest of 68 people in a drug raid. Breckenridge, who was Marengo County's chief drug enforcement officer, was convicted of conspiracy to sell drugs and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. As a result of his reporting and editorials Sutton was awarded the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award and the Society of Professional Journalists' Sunshine Award. He was inducted in 2007 into the University of Southern Mississippi's School of Mass Communication and Journalism Hall of Fame. In 2009, he received the Distinguished Community Journalist Award from Auburn University. Alabama representative Earl F. Hilliard read on the floor of Congress a declaration praising him, saying: \\"His story is a shining example of the best and the brightest which occurs in America when a single citizen has the bravery to stand alone, in the face of mounting pressure and odds, and stands up for justice and equality.\\" He and his wife were also the subject of a People magazine article. Two admiring readers submitted his work for the Pulitzer Prize for journalism, and he had supporting letters from other journalists. When the awards were to be announced a Fox News crew, a TV reporter, and a variety of other reportees were waiting with him, but he did not win. Sutton had run for office in Alabama's 7th congressional district as a Democrat in 1978, losing in the primary. After the favorable publicity received in 1998, he ran in District 72 of the Alabama House of Representatives as a Republican, but lost to the incumbent in the general election. He has been a registered Republican since at least the time of his most recent run for public office. Call for KKK revival Alabama political reporter Chip Brownlee noticed and reprinted an editorial Sutton published in the February 14, 2019, issue of his newspaper. The editorial, in which he called for the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, received international attention. When contacted by the Montgomery Advertiser, Sutton said \\"If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we'd all been better off.\\" Asked to explain what he meant by \\"cleaning up D.C.,\\" Sutton suggested lynching: \\"We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them. ‚Ä¶It's not calling for the lynchings of Americans. These are socialist-communists we're talking about. Do you know what socialism and communism is?\\" According to the Advertiser, he said Klansmen \\"didn't kill but a few people.\\" He added, \\"The Klan wasn't violent until they needed to be.\\" He also compared the KKK to the NAACP. This is only one of a series of recent inflammatory editorials in The Democrat-Reporter; according to state Sen. Bobby Singleton and Rep. Artis J. McCampbell, \\"He's been making those kind of racist epithets for a long time.\\" Under an anonymous byline, a 2012 editorial read, \\"What will happen when the Ku Klux Klan is taken over by black people trying to run from the federal government?\\" A 2016 editorial called then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 'a fat aft [sic] woman with a tubby tummy and jowls of a hog.'\\" He also called her \\"fat witch (or female dog)\\" and \\"little Miss Piggy,\\" and expressed gratitude to Russia for helping Trump get elected. An unnamed black mayor \\"displayed her African heritage by not enforcing civilized law.\\" In a 2013 editorial, Sutton wrote that \\"Slavery was a good lesson for the Jews. They didn't act right, so God punished them by letting others conquer and enslave them... There are stories which publishing companies won't print about how the black people were banished into the wilderness of Africa because God hated them.\\" =Reaction to the editorial= Alabama political columnist Kyle Whitmire, who had worked at The Democrat-Reporter as a young man, published a column in which he speculated that Sutton, 80 at the time of the editorial's release, had gone into sharp decline since the death of his wife in 2003 and might be suffering from dementia, alcoholism, or both. Sutton's editorial was criticized by Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, both of Alabama's U.S. Senators, and numerous other public figures, many of whom called on Sutton to resign. The University of Southern Mississippi removed him from its Mass Communication Hall of Fame and \\"strongly condemned\\" his remarks.Criss, Doug and Burnside, Tina (February 20, 2019) \\"The editor of an Alabama newspaper is calling for the return of the Ku Klux Klan's infamous night rides\\" CNN Auburn University's Journalism Advisory Council rescinded the Distinguished Community Journalist Award Sutton had received in 2009. The Alabama Press Association censured Sutton, saying he \\"brought disgrace upon newspapers in Alabama and the profession,\\" and suspended The Democrat-Reporter's membership in the organization. Sutton responded to the criticism by saying that he was not sorry that he wrote the editorial, and that he would do it again if he had the chance. He also said that the point of the editorial was to be \\"ironic\\": \\"[A]ll these years, the FBI and the Department of Justice have been investigating the Klan and now, that shoe is on the other foot. (The FBI and Justice Department) are doing wrong and the Klan needs to investigate them. That‚Äôs what the point of (the editorial) was. Not a lot of people understand irony today.\\"Gore, Leada (February 21, 2019) \\"Goodloe Sutton, writer of KKK editorial, not sorry, says he‚Äôd 'do it all over again'\\" AL.com On February 21, Elecia R.

It provides legal aid and counselling to asylum seekers and refugees in India.  History  M.A.P was started as The Ara Trust‚Äôs pilot programme on February 20, 2013. It was set up primarily to introduce the concept of legal representation in UNHCR‚Äôs asylum process and to ensure that every refugee in India was able to realise their right to legal assistance. The idea was to make the system more transparent and accountable and thereby bring them in line with India‚Äôs democratic ethos. The initiative was conceived by Roshni Shanker, the organisation‚Äôs founder, when she was working as a lawyer with UNHCR‚Äôs field offices, assessing asylum claims from conflict-affected countries. It was during this time that she came across some of the most inspiring stories of human spirit and endurance in the face of insurmountable hurdles. She gained intimate knowledge of what it was to rebuild one‚Äôs life in an alien land without knowing the local language and not being able to fall back on familiar support systems. Roshni also realised that traditional humanitarian interventions often fail to recognise legal assistance as being fundamental to refugees‚Äô post-conflict recovery and rehabilitation. In addition, given that the overwhelming majority of refugees are women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by conflict and remain highly vulnerable even in the country of asylum, she identified the need for specially tailored assistance for this population. She however understood that these gaps can be better addressed at grassroots level by organisations familiar with the local context. Since India had no such independent organisation at the time, Roshni decided to leave the UN and returned to start M.A.P. Today, M.A.P is one of the foremost advocates for refugees in the region and uses the law as an effective tool to expand the legal protection space for this group. It continues to evolve as an organisation constantly innovating to address the growing needs of this population in light of the local and international context. For example, in the background of India‚Äôs move towards an inclusive economic order, M.A.P is the first organisation to run an initiative to assimilate refugees within this new financial landscape.http://www.migrationandasylumproject.org/about  Programmes and Initiatives  =Legal Empowerment= India is not a party to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. However, UNHCR in India conducts Refugee Status Determination (RSD) procedures, which starts with registration of individual asylum-seekers. Following registration, UNHCR conducts interviews with each individual asylum-seeker to assess his/her claim to international protection as a refugee. In 2013, M.A.P entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UNHCR India to provide legal aid to asylum seekers for RSD interviews, and requiring UNHCR to provide a detailed rejected letter for all cases. M.A.P. is an intermediary between refugees and UNHCR and has been offering legal assistance and representation to asylum seekers from countries including Afghanistan, Somalia, and Sudan since 2013. In 2016, this model was recognised as a best practice for replication by other countries in the region by the UNHCR Headquarters. =Research and Policy= In September 2015, M.A.P published a report on ‚ÄúRefugee Protection in India: Access to Economic and Social Rights‚Äù, which was fully funded by UNHCR India. In 2015, M.A.P assisted a sitting Member of Parliament, Shashi Tharoor with the drafting of a domestic asylum law, which was introduced in the Indian Parliament as a private members Bill.http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/3088LS.pdf Members from the legal team of the organisation also contribute regularly to editorials on contemporary changes relating to refugees in India. =Advocacy and Outreach= In January 2019, M.A.P. organised an exhibition titled ‚ÄúPassage to Asylum‚Äù. Through a series of rooms, the exhibition depicted various stages of a refugee's life starting from their home to the asylum process they undergo in a different country. In July 2018, the organisation launched a livelihood initiative 'Atiqa' in association with Dastkar for Afghani refugee women in India, who are using their skills in traditional embroidery.

The treaty was intended to cement an alliance between Charles V and the House of Valois so Charles V would have the support of Francis I in inheriting Spain, and Francis I would not have opposition from Charles V in his rule of France. The terms of the treaty were that Ren√©e of France (then four years old) would be married to Charles V at the age of twelve with a dowry of 200,000 silver crowns and the Duchy of Berry, and in return Charles V would not help his grandfather Ferdinand against France. The terms of the treaty were not met by either side. Francis had just acceded to the throne of France in January 1515, so this was an early attempt to establish good relations with a potential future rival. Charles became King of Spain in January 1516, eventually adding King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor to his titles; his possessions bordered France on all sides.

They were told they were under a travel ban, and their passports were confiscated. A few hours later they disappeared and did not appear again until December 24, 2014, when it was known they were in Section 2A of Evin Prison. Torture and other abuse of prisoners is common in the prison, which is controlled by the Intelligence Division of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. On January 14, 2014, Ekhtesari and Mousavi were released on bail. Their lawyer said Moosavi was sentenced to six years in prison for \\"insulting the holy sanctities\\", three years for \\"storing tear gas\\", and 99 lashes for \\"illicit relations\\". The amount of the bail was 200 million tomans, or about 60,000 USD.  Work  Mehdi Mousavi is known for his collections of poetry, and as a leader in the \\"Postmodern Ghazal\\" movement, a radical poetry movement that challenges religious traditions. Many of his works were banned in Iran and distributed underground. The authorities refused publication of two of his collections, \\"Suddenly\\" and \\"Beeping for the Sheep\\". Some of Mousavi's lyrics have been performed by Shahin Najafi, an Iranian singer in exile. Published works include: * The Angels Have Committed Suicide (2002) * I Only Publish These for You (2005) * The Little Bird Was Neither a Bird nor Little (2010)  References   External links  Four Poems by Mehdi Mousavi 1976 births Living people ","title":"Mehdi Mousavi"},{"id":"60019630","text":"Bing Liu (born 1989) is a Chinese-American director and cinematographer. He is best known for directing the documentary Minding the Gap, which was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 91st Academy Awards. Early life and education Liu was born in China. His family moved to the United States when he was five and soon after his parents got divorced. Liu obtained American citizenship when he was 14 years old after his mother moved him to Rockford, Illinois and remarried. She had one son with his stepfather, a white American man. His stepfather was physically and mentally abusive, once shooting a gun at his mother. He referred to Liu and his brother and mother using racial slurs and subjected them to various types of abuse. Liu stated that he is no longer fluent in Mandarin as he once was because his stepfather did not let him and his mother communicate with each other using the language. He was first inspired by film-making after seeing First Love when he was 15, a video produced by Transworld Skateboarding Magazine that was mostly shot on 16 mm film. From then, he began interviewing skateboarders and learning about photography. He attended community college at Rock Valley College. Liu left Rockford when he was 19 and then attended University of Illinois at Chicago where he majored in literature. Career From 2012, he worked on various film sets, typically doing camera work. Liu's first job on a major film was as a crew member for At Any Price in 2013. His 2018 documentary film Minding the Gap centered on himself and two other young men who were skateboarders in their hometown of Rockford, Illinois. The footage was shot over 12 years, beginning when Liu was 14, though it was only in his early 20s that he decided to make the documentary. Liu is both a director and the subject of the film as he often speaks to his subjects from off camera. The film deals heavily with domestic violence and toxic masculinity. It is the first feature film that he directed. He has two forthcoming documentary projects; the first will focus on two gun violence intervention programs in Chicago, and the second, which he has not yet started filming, will focus on millennial relationships. Liu also worked as a segment director for America to Me, a documentary series released by Starz.

King of the Lands (Akkadian: ≈°ar mƒÅtƒÅti), also interpreted as just King of Lands or the more boastful King of All Lands was a title of great prestige claimed by powerful monarchs in ancient Mesopotamia. Introduced during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911 BC‚Äì609 BC), the term mƒÅtƒÅti explicitly refers to foreign (e.g. non-Assyrian) lands, often beyond the confines of Mesopotamia itself (in contrast to the word mƒÅtu which refers to the Assyrian land itself), suggesting that the Assyrian king had the right to govern foreign lands as well as his own. History The title was introduced by the king Ashurnasirpal II in the variation ≈°ar mƒÅtƒÅti ≈°arhu, meaning \\"splendid\\" or \\"glorious king of lands\\". This title, and the similar epithet of murtedu kali≈° mƒÅtƒÅte (\\"leader of all lands\\") were also used by Ashurnasirpal's son and successor Shalmaneser III. Other than these two kings, the title is rarely attested during the Neo-Assyrian period, only being used in connection to one other king, Ashurbanipal. After his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, Cyrus the Great assumed several traditional Mesopotamian titles, among them ≈°ar mƒÅtƒÅti. Cyrus and all succeeding kings of the Achaemenid Empire would use the similar title of King of Countries (Old Persian: x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya dahy≈´nƒÅm) in their inscriptions. Scribes in the city of Babylon translated this title into ≈°ar mƒÅtƒÅti. Achaemenid kings who are explicitly attested with the Akkadian- language variant (when discussed by Babylonian scribes) include Cyrus the Great, Cambyses II and Artaxerxes I. The title was also assumed by rebels in Babylon during Achaemenid times. ≈†ama≈°-erƒ´ba, who rebelled against the rule of Xerxes I, claimed to be the \\"King of Babylon and of the Lands\\". Following the collapse of the Achaemenid Empire the title is only very rarely attested for some of the succeeding rulers of Mesopotamia. It occurs rarely during the Seleucid period, with king Antiochus I claiming it alongside several other traditional Mesopotamian titles in the Antiochus cylinder, which describes how Antiochus rebuilt the Ezida Temple in the city of Borsippa. It is used only once during the Parthian Empire, claimed by king Phraates II.

Her intention to return to the UK in 2019 resulted in a public debate about the handling of returning jihadists. In February 2019, the British government issued an order revoking her British citizenship and later clarified that she would never be allowed to return. In July 2020, however, the Court of Appeal ruled that Begum should be permitted to return to the UK, so that she could fairly contest this decision by instructing lawyers properly. This ruling is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Background  Main entrance of Mulberry Academy Shoreditch, formerly known as Bethnal Green Academy Begum was born in England to parents of Bangladeshi heritage. She was brought up in the Bethnal Green area of London where she received her secondary education at the Bethnal Green Academy. Together with her friends Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, she left the UK in February 2015, at the age of fifteen. The trio travelled via Turkey, to join the jihad in Syria. Shortly after her disappearance, Begum's family hoped to learn that she and her school friends had only travelled to ISIL territory to bring back their friend Sharmeena Begum (no relation), who had travelled there in 2014. The education secretary, Nicky Morgan, said in February 2015 that everyone hoped and prayed for the safe return of the three girls to the UK. Ten days after arriving in Syria, she married Dutch-born Yago Riedijk, who had converted to Islam and arrived in Syria in October 2014. This marriage may not be recognised under Dutch law since she was underage at the time. She had three children, all of whom died; her youngest child was born in a refugee camp in February 2019 and, in March 2019, reportedly had died of a lung infection. Sources told The Daily Telegraph that Begum served in ISIL's \\"morality police\\", and also tried to recruit other young women to join the jihadist group. She was allowed to carry a Kalashnikov rifle and earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of ISIL's laws, such as dress codes for women. Additionally, an anti-ISIL activist told The Independent that there are separate allegations of \\"Begum [stitching] suicide bombers into explosive vests so they could not be removed without detonating\\".  Intended return  = Media appearance = On 13 February 2019, The Times war correspondent Anthony Loyd found Begum at the al-Hawl refugee camp in Northern Syria, in what one newspaper described as \\"scoop of the decade\\". When interviewed, Begum revealed that she was nine months pregnant and hoped to return to the UK to raise her child, but did not regret her decision to join ISIL. She said she had been unfazed by seeing the head of a beheaded man as he was \\"an enemy of Islam\\", but believes that ISIL did not deserve victory because of their corruption and oppression. When asked if she would be extracted from Syria, Security Minister Ben Wallace said, \\"I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state.\\" Three days after Loyd found her, Begum gave birth to a boy. Begum was interviewed by BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville on 18 February. During the interview, Begum asked for forgiveness and claimed that she still supports \\"some British values\\". She said she was inspired to join ISIL by videos of fighters beheading hostages and also of \\"the good life\\" under the group. However, Sommerville noted that she continues to espouse the ISIL ideology and justify its atrocities. When asked about the Manchester Arena bombing, she claimed it was wrong to kill innocent people, but that ISIL deemed it justified as retaliation for the coalition bombing of ISIL-held areas. When questioned about the rape, enslavement and murder of Yazidi women, she claimed, \\"Shia do the same in Iraq\\". = Citizenship = The following day, UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that an order had been made with the intention of stripping Begum of her British citizenship. The UK government cannot legally strip someone of their British citizenship if doing so would leave that individual stateless. However, the UK government contends that Begum holds, or is eligible for, citizenship of Bangladesh. There have been reports that immigration lawyers confirm this position. The Government of Bangladesh, however, stated that Begum does not hold Bangladeshi citizenship and will not be allowed to enter the country. British law does not allow that an individual be made stateless and Begum will have the right to appeal the Home Office's decision to revoke her UK citizenship. Javid's decision was criticised by Begum's immediate family members, who sought to stop it through legal methods, but her brother-in-law Muhammad Rahman urged the public to support the government decision. He said: \\"The information they have is to the best of their ability and the British people should support it.\\" Begum said that she might consider applying for Dutch citizenship. On 24 February, her father Ahmed Ali said, \\"If she at least admitted she made a mistake then I would feel sorry for her and other people would feel sorry for her, but she does not accept her wrong.\\" Begum reacted by stating that she regretted speaking to the media and said the UK is making an example out of her. Begum's lawyer claimed on 1 March that Begum and her son were moved from a Syrian refugee camp and relocated to another after threats against her were made. On 3 March, Yago Riedijk, her ISIL husband, was interviewed in a Kurdish detention centre in Syria by the BBC and claimed that he wishes to return to the Netherlands alongside Begum. The Dutch government stated that they do not plan to help repatriate him or reunite his family. On 8 March, it was reported that spokespeople for the Syrian Democratic Forces had confirmed that Begum's son Jarrah, whose imminent birth had apparently motivated her desire to return to the UK, had died in hospital the previous day. The cause of death was given as pneumonia in the medical certificate. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith criticised the UK government's decision to block Begum's return to the UK for her son's death. A government spokesman said that, \\"The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family\\". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reiterated the position given by Robert Ben Lobban Wallace on the risk of sending officials to recover her, and stated, \\"Shamima knew when she made the decision to join Daesh, she was going into a country where there was no embassy, there was no consular assistance, and I'm afraid those decisions, awful though it is, they do have consequences,\\" but he also stated that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development are trying to rescue ISIL brides and the decisions to withdraw citizenship from individuals were based on evidence. = Legal battles =  Legal difficulties  The main difficulty surrounding Begum's pursuit of citizenship in order to return to the United Kingdom is the contrasting interpretations and perspectives around making her stateless (without any citizenship to a country). Making citizens stateless is deemed unlawful according to both UK National Law (British Nationality Act 1981 section 40) and UN international law (1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness) of which the UK is a signatory of. Shamima Begum was born a British Citizen under UK law as her father (despite having already left the UK) had Indefinite Leave to Remain and so had the \\"settled in the United Kingdom\\" status that the 1981 Nationality Act Describes as being a satisfactory prerequisite to allow Begum to be born a British Citizen.  Chronology of Begum's pursuit of citizenship  On 15 April, it was reported that Begum had been granted Legal Aid to fight the revocation of her British citizenship. Hunt described the Legal Aid Agency's decision as \\"very uncomfortable\\", but said that the UK is \\"a country that believes that people with limited means should have access to the resources of the state if they want to challenge the decisions the state has made about them\\". On 3 May, Bangladeshi foreign minister Abdul Momen repeated their position on Begum but further added that if she entered Bangladesh she will face the death penalty due to the nation's \\"zero tolerance policy\\" towards terrorism. In August 2019, the Metropolitan Police requested media organisations that had interviewed Begum‚Äîthe BBC, ITN, Sky News and The Times‚Äîto surrender any unpublished material they may hold about Begum. They seek disclosure under the Terrorism Act 2000 in order to prepare potential prosecution. Her lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, has made repeated journeys to Kurdish occupied Syria, to meet with Begum, only to be turned away. On 16 July 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled that Begum can return to the UK to contest the government's decision to rescind her British citizenship. It is currently unclear how she will return to the UK to plead her case, as the British government previously stated that they will never let her return.

The company operates its mobile communications services under the We4G brand and the other services it operates under the \\"XFONE 018\\" The company is part of the group of companies of the Israeli businessman, Hezi Bezalel. History XFONE was originally founded in 2000 in the United Kingdom by Guy Nissensohn, who previously served as Marketing Director at RADA Electronic Industries. The dispute with Rada: Guy Nissenson's libel suit was rejected against CEO Herzl Bodinger, and Abraham Keinan, on the basis of a small communications infrastructure company called Swiftnet, which was founded in London on June 3, 2004, 1990, by Kenan, Nissensohn invested US$100,000 in the company, and together with Keinan began to expand its activity Guy Nissensohn served as CEO and Avraham Keinan as chairman. In 2002 it on listed on AMEX without raising money, and in 2004 raised 3 ml ($15 million). In 2005 the company raised $4.2 million at a company value of $30 million, and in 2004 it started communications activity in the United States, which includes the provision of domestic and international communications services, In July 2004, XFONE Israel received a license from the Ministry of Communications for international telephony services. In July 2006, XFONE International shares were listed for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the time, XFONE comprised a number of companies, including Swiftnet Limited, a British company providing local and international telecommunications services and value added services, and XFONE USA, Inc., an American company providing local and international telecommunications services. In August 2007, it acquired NTS Communications from Dallas, Texas, which provides integrated solutions, voice, video and data, for $42 million. This acquisition more than doubled the company's operations in the United States and XFONE has started operating in the United States under the brand name of NTS and not XFONE USA. In 2010, the businessman Hezi Bezalel purchased the XFONE Israel company. At the same time, XFONE International was disbanded when Avraham Kenan sold his shares to Guy Nissensohn and continued to buy back the activity in the United Kingdom. At the end of 2013, the activity in the United States was sold to a US investment fund at a company value of $83 million.  Areas of activity  = International call services = In 2004, XFONE was one of three companies that received a license to provide international telephony services after the Ministry of Communications decided to open the market to additional competition (XFONE in prefix 018, NetVision with prefix 017, Internet Gold in prefix 015). When the international calls segment was opened to competition in 1997, only three licenses were issued for \\"Gold Lines\\" (012), \\"Barak\\" (013) and Bezeq International (014). = Internet = At the beginning of 2009, it began supplying Internet services and offered the cheapest price in the market. In 2013, XFONE was the first Israeli ISP to provide IPv6 customers with an IPv6 protocol on the site In March 2013, XFONE was the first provider of a full internet connection (supplier and infrastructure) and landline telephone over the Bezeq infrastructure, without the need to contract with another company, according to the \\"wholesale agreement\\" model Bo XFONE is the property of Bezeq infrastructure, but in terms of customer XFONE is the only address. = Cellular communication = In April 2011, XFONE won a tender by the Ministry of Communications for the establishment of a cellular network in Israel. In May 2011, the concession was canceled after it failed to raise the required bank guarantee and it was transferred to Golan Telecom. XFONE, through its new subsidiary, the 018 Marathon, won the tender for the fourth generation frequencies of the Ministry of Communications in January. Following the tender, the company signed a contract for the establishment of a joint cellular antenna network with the companies Cellcom and Golan Telecom through a JV company called CMG JV. In fact, Cellcom operates its own antenna network, while XFONE and Golan Telecom use it under the terms of the agreement between them. In April 2018, the company began operating as the sixth cellular operator in the Israeli market (under the \\"We4G\\" brand). Domestic telephony in November 2007, the Ministry of Communications received a license to conduct a marketing trial for the provision of domestic telephony services over VOB- Voice Over Broadband technology. In May 2008, XFONE began to market Internet- based telephone services using VoIP technology, under a license for a marketing trial received from the Ministry of Communications. On November 8, 2009, XFONE announced to its customers the termination of the trial and the cancellation of all the lines.

Involved with anarchist activities by the age of 17, she was part of an armed group ready to take on nationalist forces when the Spanish Civil War started in July 1936. She saw action in Barcelona and Aragon, before eventually moving to a French refugee camp where she gave birth to her only son. P√©rez Collado returned to France around 1942, where she lost and then regained custody of her son. P√©rez Collado also reconnected with Maurici Palau, and the couple opened a jewelry and underwear shop which hosted anarchist meetings. Following the death of Franco, she became more openly involved in local organizing events and continued her anarchist activities. P√©rez Collado died on 17 April 2014, in Barcelona, one of the last of her generation of female Civil War fighters to die.  Youth  P√©rez Collado was born on 17 October 1915 in Les Cortes, Barcelona.Mor Conxa P√©rez, una de les √∫ltimes milicianes de la CNT a la Guerra Civil. El Punt Avui. [Consulted: 18 April 2015]. Her father, Juan P√©rez G√ºell, had six children by two different women, with P√©rez being his third. Her mother died as a result of tuberculosis when she was a 2-year-old. An anarchist, P√©rez G√ºell spent time in prison as a result of his political beliefs. As a child, P√©rez Collado was unable to attend school. When she was in her early teens, she started working in a graphic arts workshop. By the age of 16 she had left this job, and was involved with Ateneo Libertario Faro and Ateneo Agrupaci√≥n Humanidad. P√©rez Collado was an anarchist. P√©rez Collado joined Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI) in 1932. The following year, she was at a protest in front of a factory when she was arrested along with a companion for carrying a concealed weapon. Later, after being released from prison, she worked in carpentry. She kept this job until the outbreak of the Civil War.  Civil War  When the Civil War started in July 1936, P√©rez Collado already had access to weapons and was ready to head to the front. Part of an anarchist group that were preparing for what they saw as an inevitable military uprising, she trained with weapons in anticipation of an upcoming conflict. In the early days of the war, P√©rez Collado was part of Los Aguiluchos de Les Corts, a group of 100 armed soldiers from her Barcelona neighborhood. Only seven of them were women. Shortly after the start of the Civil War, P√©rez Collado was part of a group that attacked the Model Prison with the goal of freeing political prisoners. Later, she was part of a group that took control of a convent. She also assisted in creating barricades in her Barcelona neighborhood. Along with other anarchists, she rode in the back of a pickup truck covered by a mattress and with four guns between them. They went to the Pedralbes Barracks, engaged in fighting there and managed to gain a small cache of weapons. Following this, her group went to Caspe on the Aragon front. Once in Caspe, she joined the Ort√≠z column, going with her new unit to Azaida. Her unit stayed in Azaida until they mobilized for the attack on Belchite on 24 August 1936. She remained on the Aragon front for another four months, after which she departed for the Huesca. Starting in December, she was part of a group of militia women () that fought in the Tardienta sector. The women were eventually moved off the front by the end of the year, and she returned to Barcelona to work in a munitions factory. Back in Barcelona in May 1937, P√©rez Collado was ambushed and wounded while patrolling the area near Plaza de Catalunya. The metal fragment that was lodged in her leg would stay in her body for several years. She left for the border in December 1938 when Barcelona fell. She found herself in the Argel√®s refugee camp, where she subsequently volunteered as a nurse. While there, she met socialist Madrid doctor Isidoro Alonso and became involved with him. The two would become parents to P√©rez Collado's only child, a son who was born in Marseilles.  Post Civil War life  In September 1942, P√©rez Collado returned to Barcelona only to lose custody of her son because the state determined she could not adequately care for him. Finding work as a domestic for a Jewish family, they went on to assist her in regaining custody of him by demonstrating she had enough money to raise him. While in Barcelona, P√©rez Collado also reconnected with Maurici Palau. A former lover, he had been recently released from a four-year prison stint. The couple then started a jewelry and undergarment shop at the Mercado de Sant Antoni. The shop also doubled as a meeting place for anarchists. During this time, she continued to be a CNT militant. After the Civil War, she came much more active in the CGT. Following Franco's death in 1973, she became involved in her local neighborhood associations. From 1982 to 1984, P√©rez Collado participated in a series of interviews with Nick Rider about anarchism in Spain during the 1930s. Mujeres de 36 was created in 1997, with P√©rez Collado one of its founders. P√©rez Collado died on 17 April 2014 in Barcelona. Her death at the age of 98 in 2014 marked the end of an era, as she was one of the last surviving Spanish militia women from the Civil War. Legacy Members of the collective setting up a library at the local squatted social centre l'Entrebanc soon after P√©rez Collado had died, decided to call the project Social Library Conxa P√©rez in tribute to her life.

It was established in early 2019 by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to bring together information technology teams from the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, and NHS Improvement. NHSX will work closely with the Government Digital Service and other relevant government functions. It is led by Matthew Gould. The 'X' in NHSX stands for \\"user experience\\". Activities One of the first initiatives announced in April 2019 was a programme to improve patient experience in the therapy areas of cancer and mental health. It would be a collaboration between technologists, clinicians and policymakers. The goal was to improve access to services for patients, to deliver the right diagnostic information to clinicians, and to provide researchers with healthcare data. In May 2019, Hancock announced plans to upgrade all hospitals, GP practices and community care services to full fibre connectivity, which is intended to enable more video consultations and improve the speed of access to clinical information. In a speech delivered on 12 June 2019, Baroness Blackwood, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care, identified three delivery priorities for NHSX, which are \\"focused on how we can make things better for patients and staff as soon as possible\\". These priorities are: *cutting the amount of time that clinicians spend inputting and accessing data in NHS systems *making it easier for patients to access key NHS services on a smartphone *ensuring that essential diagnostic information can be accessed safely and reliably, from wherever a patient may be within the NHS. Underlying these delivery priorities, she also noted that the technical priority for NHSX is the creation of a data-driven ecosystem.Blackwood, N., Embracing AI and technology to improve patient outcomes, CogX Festival, GOV.UK, published 12 June 2019, accessed 24 June 2019 It was announced in January 2020 that ¬£40 million was to be dedicated to improving login times for staff, using single sign-on technology.

Prior to becoming Governor, Soediro served as Jakarta's mayor for five years until the city was made its own special capital region. Soediro was also Governor of Sulawesi between 1951 and 1953. Career Soediro was educated in a teachers' training school. Before Indonesia's independence, Soediro was active in various nationalist organizations such as the Jong Java and Partai Indonesia. He was also active in education, becoming the head of a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (Junior High School) between 1931 and 1933, and later he chaired Taman Siswa in Madiun between 1933 and 1936. Between 1936 and 1937, he was assistant to Ernest Douwes Dekker. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Soediro became one of the leaders of the Barisan Pelopor, a militant arm of the Japan-formed . Shortly after the Indonesian proclamation of independence in 1945, Soediro decided to acquire a luxury car for Sukarno. His plan was to steal a Buick limousine belonging to the Japanese Chief of Railways, which he believed to be the best car in Jakarta. Soediro approached the Japanese official's driver, whom he knew, and convinced the driver to aid in the theft by handing over the keys and returning to his hometown. However, neither Soediro nor his group knew how to drive. Also in 1945, he became a member of the newly refounded Indonesian National Party. He also became one of the leaders of the Barisan Banteng, the successor to the Barisan Pelopor. Soediro became the Deputy Resident of Surakarta in 1946 and later the Resident between 1947 and 1950 (as Military Resident since 1948), and then Resident of Madiun between 1950 and 1951. Between 1951 and 1953, he was the Governor of Sulawesi. He was sworn into office in July 1951, and during his time he set up administrative regions in Sulawesi, such as dividing Central Sulawesi into Palu and Donggala administrative regions. During his time in various offices, Soediro also became a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia which attempted to form a new constitution. =Jakarta= Soediro was then assigned as Mayor of Jakarta in December 1953, replacing the Masyumi Party member Sjamsuridjal. Shortly after his appointment, in January 1954 he reorganized the city's local electoral committees, which resulted in large protests. Under Soediro's administration, Jakarta's growth necessitated its division into three administrative cities ‚Äì North Jakarta, Central Jakarta, and South Jakarta. By 1958, Soediro's position was elevated to that of a governor as Jakarta was elevated to a province. His administration saw the preparation for the construction of the Istiqlal Mosque and Hotel Indonesia, and despite little success, Soediro fought for the conservation of both Jakarta's electric tram and historical sites. Soediro also implemented a new system of administrative units based on the 1940s Japanese administration, implementing the Rukun Tetangga and Rukun Warga systems to administer the city at neighborhood and block levels. Throughout his term, Soediro encountered significant intervention from President Sukarno. As an example, elementary education was briefly made free by his administration in 1957, but a year later the policy was overridden by the central government. In December 1959, Soediro opted to not run for the governorship and he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo. After his retirement from politics, he continued to work as an educator. He died in 1992. Family Soediro was married to Siti Djauhari Soediro. One of their grandchildren, Tora Sudiro, is a film director.

The project was then put on hiatus in 2008, before being brought back in 2010. SMP continues to issue albums digitally with Hacked Vol. 2 being released in 2016 by Music Ration Entertainment. History Musicians Sean Setterberg, later taking the moniker Sean Ivy, and Jason Bazinet were originally based in San Diego and San Francisco before relocating to Washington and forming Synthesia Murder Program. The duo's sample-based sound was informed by industrial music, punk music and rap music. The band self- released their debut EP called Stalemate in 1994. In 1995, SMP issued their debut studio album Stalemate after signing to Re-Constriction Records. The album was critically acclaimed, with John Bush of allmusic declaring that \\"SMP recall[s] the industrial grooves of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult on Stalemate, except with more of an emphasis on rapping.\\" After Stalemate's release the band decided to change artistic direction and opted to embrace a less abrasive sound. Showcasing a greater emphasis on techno music, SMP issued their second album Ultimatum in 1998 on Catastrophe Records. Sean Ivy left SMP around this time to join Christ Analogue and was replaced by guitarist Rick Aguilar and drummer Xian Di Marris. SMP's third full-length album Terminal saw the return of Sean Ivy and was released in 2000, a remix album titled Hacked followed in 2002.

In 2010, at the age of fourteen, Davies made her debut for Sussex, taking the wicket of Charlotte Edwards. She has played more than 70 games for her county. In 2019, she debuted for England in both Women's Twenty20 Internationals and Women's One Day Internationals. Early life and career When Davies was a young child, her father, and her older brother Jack, both played for the family's local cricket club, Chichester. At the age of eight, Davies decided to join in, and played her first hard-ball game with Jack's under-11 team. She was attracted to fast bowling, because \\"that seemed like the most fun\\"; at 10 and 11 she was tall for her age, and that also helped. Eventually, she joined the Sussex junior ranks as an 11 year old. Three years later, in 2010, Davies made her debut for Sussex's senior team, against Kent, and was lucky to have England star Sarah Taylor behind the stumps. On the second day of her debut match, she took her first wicket, of the then England captain Charlotte Edwards, thanks in part to a catch by Taylor that Davies later described to The Cricketer as \\"unbelievable\\". At that time, Davies was a pupil at Chichester High School for Girls, a state school that did not have a cricket team. Two years after her county debut, Brighton College offered her a sixth form sports scholarship, and she accepted. The College knew of her potential because its then head of cricket, Alexia Walker, had been her captain on her debut. From Davies' perspective, the most appealing thing about Brighton College's cricket program was that girls could play in the boys' teams; she played for both the boys 1st and 2nd XI during her two years there. In 2020, Davies told The Cricketer: After finishing school, Davies had to prioritise either study or cricket. England's elite women's cricket Academy is based on campus at Loughborough University, and therefore almost all current England players are Loughborough graduates or students. However, Davies chose the University of Exeter instead, as she felt it was the best choice for the degree in law she wanted to obtain. At Exeter, Davies gave priority to getting her degree. For two years, she also attended training sessions at Loughborough - an eight-hour round trip away - every other weekend. In her third year, she gave cricket away entirely, taking the risk that a place at the England Academy might not still be available to her if she wanted to resume playing the game. However, following her graduation in July 2017 with upper second- class honours, Davies helped her Kia Super League team, Western Storm, to its first title. Soon afterwards, she was awarded an England \\"rookie\\" contract, which enabled her to train full-time without having to take up other employment. Rookie contracts do not provide anything like a living wage, and the alternative for Davies was a lucrative career as a lawyer. Even so, she persisted with cricket; as she told ESPNcricinfo in 2019: Domestic career Davies played every game for Western Storm in the Kia Super League from its inception in 2016 until its conclusion in 2019 (36 games). The team were runners-up in 2016 and won the title in 2017, beating Southern Vipers in the final. In 2018, Storm made it to Finals Day, but lost to eventual winners, Surrey Stars, in the semi-final. In 2019 Western Storm finished top of the KSL league, taking them directly to the final where they beat Southern Vipers by 6 wickets, to claim their second title and become the most successful team in KSL history. Davies finished as the leading wicket-taker in the 2019 competition with a record 19 wickets. She finished as the second highest wicket-taker in the four years of the competition with a total of 37 wickets. International career In February 2019, Davies was one of twenty-one cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Later the same month, she was named in the England women's cricket team squad for their tours to India and Sri Lanka. She made her Women's Twenty20 International cricket (WT20I) debut for England against Sri Lanka Women on 24 March 2019. In October 2019, Davies was named as one of the first two players signed for London Spirit (alongside England captain Heather Knight), in the inaugural Hundred competition scheduled to start in August 2020. The following month, she was named in England's Women's One Day International (WODI) squad for their series against Pakistan. She made her Women's One Day International (WODI) for England, against Pakistan, on 14 December 2019. In January 2020, she was named in England's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia. On 18 June 2020, Davies was named in a squad of 24 players to begin training ahead of international women's fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is an organisation with the intention of representing and providing services and welfare for the students of University of Newcastle upon Tyne. It was originally set up as the Union Society and changed to its present name in 2011. It is not affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS). The Students' Union is run by seven sabbatical officers and nine part-time unpaid officer positions. It also employs around 300 people in ancillary roles including bar staff and entertainment organisers. Students' Union Building The Students' Union Building Unlike the majority of other students' unions in the United Kingdom, Newcastle University Students' Union owns the building where it is housed. The Union building was built in 1924 following a generous gift from an anonymous donor, who is believed to have been Sir Cecil Cochrane, a major benefactor to the university. It is built in the neo-Jacobean style and was designed by the local architect Robert Burns Dick whose firm designed the Laing Art Gallery, the towers of the Tyne Bridge and The Spanish City in Whitley Bay. It was opened on 22 October 1925 by the Rt. Hon. Lord Eustace Percy, who later served as Rector of King's College from 1937 to 1952. In 1987 the Students' Union was made a Grade II listed building. The building was originally split in two with one union for men and one for women. In the 1960s the university funded a significant extension, known as the 'flying wing'. This was given to the union for a 99-year lease with a peppercorn rent. The modernist copper-clad extension, which is part of the Hadrian Building, was designed by Sir William Whitfield who also designed the Northern Stage. A debating chamber which hung over Kings Road was also built, though it was demolished in 2003. In 2010 the university donated ¬£8 million towards a redevelopment project for the Union Building. This work won the Education Interior Design category of the National Mixology Interior Design Awards 2011. The building houses Luther's ‚Äì the student union bar, the Student Advice Centre (SAC) and food outlets including Subway and Domino's, along with a number of offices and rooms for its members. In the basement is Venue, a nightclub and event space, with space for 1,400 people. Artists that have performed at Students' Union include Max√Ømo Park,https://www.nusu.co.uk/news/article/6013/Six-Appeal/ Snow Patrol, Coldplay,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife- news/newcastle-freshers-2014-10-best-8162874 George Ezra and The 1975. The union building also houses a printers and a branch of Santander. History Union society building (left) in 1950 NUSU is made from a merger of several earlier student organisations. The oldest of these was the Junior Union Society, founded in 1881, which arranged debates and dances for the Durham colleges in Newcastle. From 1914 to 1925 Newcastle Union Society and the Durham Union Society collaborated with a shared president and vice-president selected alternatively from the two divisions. The previous Union Society dealt almost solely with student societies and entertainment and was governed by a Union Management Committee. The committee was composed of the President (in the Chair), the Lady President, two Vice Presidents (one male, one female), the Secretary, and various members of staff from King's College (including the Bursar and the Society Steward). This structure remained in varying forms until the 1950s. The Students‚Äô Representative Council (SRC) of Armstrong College was formed in 1900 to represent all students, in matters of policy, to the Board of Professors. It remained a separate entity from the Union Society. In 1937 it became the SRC of King's College, and subsequently for Newcastle University when it disaffiliated from Durham University in 1963. The management of the Union building was run by a board of trustees appointed by the University Council. In 1985, the SRC was merged into the Union Society. This put the student council and its elected student representatives in full control of the union. In 1990 the union also went through significant restructuring after a period of poor management and high debts. The Union Society became a limited company, with a board of trustees, in 2009. In 2011 it also became an independent charity after completing the legal requirements and registering with the Charity Commission. This coincided with a name change to Newcastle University Students‚Äô Union (NUSU). In 2017, the Students' Union voted to rename the student bar from Mensbar to Luther's, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the honorary doctorate awarded to Martin Luther King Jr. by the university in 1967. The previous name came from the fact it was initially male-only, originally Men's bar, and from the motto - ‚ÄòMens Agitat Molem‚Äô ‚Äì of the Armstrong College. = National Union of Students = In May 2016, NUSU held a referendum on their membership of the NUS. A 67 per cent majority of students voted to end the affiliation. The then NUSU president Dominic Fearon said students felt the NUS ‚Äúno longer represents their views, does not prioritise correctly, and is not effective at achieving change.‚Äù A second referendum was held in December 2018 with the result being to not re- affiliate with 52% of the vote, and a turnout of only 4%. Clubs and societies Newcastle Students' Union has over 160 registered student societies in many different areas from the 20 Minute Society to Zumba.NUSU - Societies List There are also 65 sports clubs run through the Athletic Union (AU).NUSU - Sports clubs Students are able to set up their own societies. For a society to become ratified it must have 15 members as well as an executive committee which consists of a president, secretary and treasurer. Any student is eligible to become a member of a society and the typical membership fee is ¬£5.  Elected Officers  Newcastle University Students' Union is run by seven full-time Sabbatical Officers and eight unpaid part-time \\"Liberation Officers\\". The sabbatical officers work as full-time employees of the Students' Union whilst the part-time officers complete the role alongside their studies. In September 2019, the Students' Union introduced the seventh sabbatical officer position, the Postgraduate Officer. They are responsible for representing students studying, both taught and research, postgraduate courses such as master's degrees and PhD's. The role is only open to students who have previously studied at postgraduate level. Officers are elected usually in March via a cross-campus vote typically preceded by a four-day campaign period. All Newcastle University students are eligible to vote in elections via the Student Union website. Officers officially begin their roles in July of the year in which they are elected. The election period typically sees candidates canvassing around campus and student accommodation sites as well as participate in debates facilitated by the Students' Union and in more recent years, The Courier, NSR and NUTV. The results of the elections are typically announced on the Friday of elections week often in a live-show format held within the Students' Union. Newcastle University Students' Union currently uses a transferable voting system which allows students to vote for candidates for each position in order of preference as well as vote to re-open nominations (RON) if the student does not feel any candidates are appropriate for the role. Student media The Courier is a weekly free student newspaper. Established in 1948, the current weekly readership is around 12,000, most of whom are students at the university. It is published every Monday during term time. The Courier has won The Guardian's Student Newspaper of the Year award in 1994, 2012 and 2013. The Courier is edited by a number of section sub-editors who are all Newcastle University students. The Courier also has a head editor who works full-time editing the newspaper. The role is currently a sabbatical officer role and is therefore elected by Newcastle University students for a one-year term. The current editor is Grace Dean. Newcastle Student Radio (NSR) is an award-winning student radio station based in the university, which broadcasts 24 hours a day. It host's music alongside news, sport and talk programs. The station aims to cater for a wide range of musical tastes, from Metal and Punk to R&B; and swing music. NUTV, known as TCTV from 2010‚Äì17, is a student television channel first established in 2007. NUTV's output is on-demand on its YouTube channel and through live broadcasts. It covers events such as student council and sports as well as student-made dramas, cookery programmes and fashion shows.

History  = Quran of the nurse = The kairouani calligraphy was used for the first time in the nurse's Quran. It was discovered during the conservation work of the manuscripts of the old library in the Great Mosque of Kairouan, after the publication of a paper in an Egyptian journal in 1897 criticizing the safeguarding condition of the collections. Later in 1948, the French archaeologist Louis Poinssot conducted a deeper research on the manuscripts. He disassembled them and took their bindings to the Bardo museum leaving the parchments separated and classified by size and condition. The manuscript was written in 1020 during the last decades of Kairouan‚Äôs intellectual and political golden era. It was kept for centuries in the maqsurah of Ibn Badis, in the main prayer room of the Great Mosque. The maqsura is a small cell measuring 8x6m next to the qibla wall that served as a book storage room. Also, it was mentioned in a tahbiss describing the people who were in engaged in its creation such as Ali Ibn Ahmed al-Warraq the chief of the scriptorium, Fatimah Al Hadhinah, the caretaker of the Zirid prince, is the patron who ordered the book, and Dora Al Katibah, a second woman who according to some historians was the patron‚Äôs secretary or a scribe. This Quran was later donated to enrich the library of the great mosque as part of a political strategy endorsed by the Qadi of Kairouan, Abdallah Ben Hachem. In the Quran of the Fadhel, one of the sentences of a colophon confirms that the book was written by women ‚Äò‚Äôshe wrote it with her hands‚Äù. Besides this, another trace of the Nurse‚Äôs Quran can be found in the mediaeval inventory set in 1294 by a scribe called Al Khalidini. According to this inventory, the manuscript is just an element of a 125 religious manuscripts collection, 65 of which are Qurans.

The page measure 44,5x30cm and contain five lines (6 cm high) each. These leaves are currently exposed in different museums of the world such as the Metropolitan Museum in New York, The David Collection in Copenhagen and the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Yet, the most important part is preserved in the Raqqada Museum in Kairouan. alt= = Evolution = The kairouani style remained very discrete and very few examples where it was is used during the same period as Quran of the Nurse were found. Among these examples, we can mention a small travel pocket Quran written on parchment dating from the 10th century. By the 11th century, the presence of Kairouani calligraphy started to decline with the arrival of the andalu calligraphy. According to Ibn Khaldun, this style remained used only in the Djerid in the south ouest of Tunisia as this region is very far geographically from the influence of andalu culture. In 2017, The Tunisian Association for the Art of Calligraphy conducted a research on the script and introduced it in its curriculum. In partnership with some other private institutions and associations, the calligraphers gave courses for the local community of the medina and all people interested to learn the basics of Kairouani script. The fifth edition of Tunisian Calligraphy 2017 was dedicated to the Kairouani style, and as a way to emphasize on its importance, many Tunisian calligraphy masters presented paintings featuring the Kairouani script such as Alhassoumi Zitoun, Najet Ennouri and Zouhour Arfaoui. In 2018, the script got digitalized and a digital typo that can be used on any Microsoft Word-based processing software became available for download.  Description  In general, the letters in kairouani style are bold and angular. They are not dotted , well seated on a horizontal line. Alif (ÿß) and Lam (ŸÑ), the vertical letters, are perfectly perpendicular, and the first alif is always distinguished with an extra lower tail finishing horizantally to the right like in all Kufic styles in general. On the other hand, low letters such as Ba (ÿ®) or seen (ÿ≥), are characterized by their parallel and closely group short dents. Finally, for some other letters that have bulbs like the dha (ÿ∂) or the kef (ŸÉ) a Mashq (a second upper horizontal line or a rectangle) is added and stretched horizontally proportionally to the left space and the length of the word to make it first in the line. Final characteristic is that words do not split and verse markers are absent.

The building has approximately , standing 13 stories () tall. It was built in 1914 for the Kaufmann & Baer Co. department store. From 1925 to 1986 the building housed a Gimbels department store. Sitting largely vacant for 15 years, the building was remodeled into office space, serving as H.J. Heinz Co. North American Headquarters from 2002 to 2013. The building was designated as historical landmark by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation in 1982. History Kaufmanns Department Store was run by the four Kaufmann brothers: Jacob, Isaac, Morris and Henry. In 1913, Morris Kaufmann and his son Edgar bought out the other family members and incorporated Kaufmann's. Isaac, Ludwig and Nathan Kaufmann partnered with Morris and Julius Baer to start a new department store, Kaufmann & Baer Co.. They built the 13 story, 700,000 square foot building at the corner of Sixth and Smithfield in downtown Pittsburgh. The store opened on March 18, 1914, advertising that there was \\"no connection with any other store\\". On December 2, 1925 Gimbel Brothers purchased Kaufmann & Baer Co., with the store name updated to Gimbels on January 3, 1928. Included in the purchase was WCAE, the in store radio station, one of the five original Pittsburgh stations, first broadcasting on May 4, 1922. WCAE was Gimbels third radio station, after WIP in Philadelphia and WGBS in New York City. Saks Fifth Avenue opened its seventh branch location in September 1949 within the Gimbels Pittsburgh Store. Saks occupied 20,000 sq ft on the 6th floor for 30 years until moving one block down Smithfield street to their own four-story building formerly occupied by W.T. Grant Co. on Aug. 22, 1977. Gimbels closed on September 13, 1986 after doing business on Smithfield Street for 61 years. The building was purchased by Richard Penzer in 1992 for $2.75 million, although it had an assessed value of $14 million at the time. Penzer was able to lease the first couple levels of the old store with retailers Burlington Coat Factory, Barnes & Noble Booksellers and Eckerd Drug, but the top 9 floors, remained vacant. Penzer had purchased 12 Pittsburgh buildings in the early 1990s, and during that time gained two orthodox rabbinical business partners, Israel Chait and Walter Friedman. By 1997, Penzer was in negotiations to sell the building to the Glimcher Realty Trust for $17 million. The sale of the building to Glimcher fell apart when Penzer alleged Mr. Chait, his former religious adviser, brainwashed him into sharing his property ownership with Mr. Chait and RZMF, draining millions from his real estate fortune. McKnight Realty Partners purchased the building for $15 million in 1999. At this time the building had been largely vacant for nearly 15 years. The entire building underwent a $25 million remodel, converting into class-A office space. The revisions included adding an 8-story atrium to bring light to dark interior floors, each over an acre in size. In 2001 H.J. Heinz Co. leased floors 7 though 14, totaling of the newly remodeled building, in order to relocate their North American headquarters. As part of the lease agreement, the building was renamed the Heinz 57 Center. In 2013, H.J. Heinz Co. announced it would lay off 600 employees across its operations in the U.S. and Canada, including 350 in Pittsburgh, departing its office space in the Heinz 57 Center. Heinz had several office locations in Pittsburgh at the time, choosing to consolidate their remaining office workers into a single building at PPG Place In 2014, UPMC agreed to sublease the majority of the space vacated by Heinz. UPMC moved 550 employees from One Chatham Center into the Heinz 57 Center. UPMC's departure from One Chatham Center left the space nearly vacant, driving the property into foreclosure.

The original structure is a nineteenth-century farmhouse, the Ella Sharp House (also known as the Merriman-Sharp House), which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History In 1855, Abraham Wing of Glen Falls, New York purchased a large farm at this location, then on the outskirts of the city of Jackson. In 1856, Wing's daughter Mary married Dwight Merriman, and the couple assumed management of the farm, although Wing still owned it. The farm at the time included a small house, likely built in the early 1840s. The Merrimans immediately expanded this house by adding a Greek Revival front section to it. In 1862, they expanded the house again, adding an Italianate tower and another small addition. By the 1860s, the farm was one of the most prosperous in the area, and the Merrimans were active in the community's social life. The Merrimans had four children, three of whom died young. The fourth, Ella, was born in 1857. In 1881, Ella married John C. Sharp, a lawyer who had served as Jackson City Attorney and as Prosecuting Attorney for Jackson County. In 1884, The Merrimans turned their farm over to John and Ella Sharp to move into town, and John discontinued his law practice to concentrate on farming. Under the Sharps management, the farm improved even more. John Sharp died in 1908, and Ella Sharp continued to manage the farm until her death in 1912. Ella Sharp bequeathed the house and farm to the city of Jackson to be used as a museum and park. The city of Jackson hired Winiford C. Trout, who began laying out the grounds of the park in 1915. The Ella Sharp Park was opened in 1916. Trout used the farmhouse for over 20 years as his residence, during his tenure as supervisor of the park. However, the Ella Sharp Museum did not open until 1965. Description The Ella Sharp House is a two-story brick structure with an attached three-story freestanding Italianate tower topped with a wooden cupola. The house has a tetrastyle two story front porch. The windows are six over six units with stone lintels and sills and shutters. The surrounding yard is enclosed by a solid stone wall, constructed at some point prior to 1865. A carriage porch graces the south side-of the house. The Ella Sharp Museum contains other buildings in a surrounding historical complex. These include the 1875 Dibble School, a log cabin, and a country store.

She has carried out in-depth fieldwork in China, Brazil, and other countries that are affected by the mining of rare earth elements. Klinger is the author of Rare Earth Frontiers: From Terrestrial Subsoils to Lunar Landscapes (2017) which traces the history and use of rare earth elements from the 1880s to the present. Rare Earth Frontiers won the 2017 Meridian Book Award for Outstanding Scholarly Work in Geography given by the American Association of Geographers (AAG) for making an ‚Äúunusually important contribution to advancing the science and art of geography.‚Äù Education Julie Michelle Klinger graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a B.A. in 2006. While at Sarah Lawrence, she worked with Joshua Muldavin. In addition, she earned a certificate from the Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies at Johns Hopkins University in 2007. She earned her PhD in geography at the University of California, Berkeley in 2015, with the dissertation On the Rare Earth Frontier. Her advisor was Michael J. Watts. Career In 2015, Klinger accepted a position at Boston University. She was an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University until 2019 where she also served as one of the associate directors of the Land Use and Livelihoods Initiative (LULI) at the university's Global Development Policy Center (GDP Center).. In January 2020, she moved to the University of Delaware's Department of Geography and Spatial Sciences and also became affiliated with the university's new Minerals, Materials and Society Program. Klinger traces the history of rare earth elements, 17 elements which are important to a wide variety of technologies including electronics, telecommunications, medicine, green energy (solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles), and defensive systems. She traces connections between geology, mining, corporations, political and military power structures, and communities from the 1880s to the present, around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mountain Pass Mine in southern California was the major source of rare earth elements in the world. Beginning in the 1990s, the Chinese government emphasized policies that led to its dominance in the world market for rare earths, and to severe environmental and human damage in the \\"sacrifice zone\\" of Baotou in Inner Mongolia. Klinger has done fieldwork in a wide variety of communities affected by rare earths mining. A major area of focus is Inner Mongolia in China. Another is India. She has also studied communities in Brazil, Germany, Australia, and the United States. Speaking of her work with the people of Bayan Obo, she says: Klinger also studies the legal and political implications of proposals to mine rare earths on the moon, which is currently protected under an international treaty. Rare Earth Frontiers Klinger received the 2017 Meridian Book Award for Outstanding Scholarly Work in Geography from the American Association of Geographers for her work Rare Earth Frontiers: From Terrestrial Subsoils to Lunar Landscapes. In this book, she examines the production and consumption of the so-called rare-earth elements. Contrary to the name, accessible deposits of these minerals occur around the world, but they are difficult to extract and purify. Processing produces large amounts of radioactive and toxic chemical waste. Klinger addresses geographical, geological and geopolitical issues. She examines ways in which the terms \\"rare earths\\" and \\"frontier\\" reinforce a scarcity myth that is used to justify environmental and human damage. Klinger encourages readers to consider concrete alternatives that can lead to more sustainable extraction and use of these elements. She emphasizes that there are known solutions to problems in extracting elements and managing dangerous wastes, and that the issues are less a matter of available technology than of political will.

It is native to the northern Pacific Ocean where it is found in the subtidal waters around Japan. Taxonomy This spoon worm was first described by the Japanese zoologist I. Ikeda in 1904 as Thalassema taenioides, the type locality being Misaki, Sagami Bay, in Honshu, Japan. Examination of the musculature of the body wall led to the observation that the longitudinal muscle layer lay outside both the circular layer and the inner oblique layer, and as this was at odds with all other members of the subclass Echiura, it warranted the creation of a new order. However, examination of the original material by Teruaki Nishikawa in 2002, showed that the longitudinal muscle layer was in fact between the circular layer and the oblique layer, as in all other echurians, throwing the taxonomy of the species into doubt. Nishikawa advocates that the family Ikedidae be regarded as a junior synonym of Echiuridae. Description Ikeda taenioides is the largest spoon worm in the world, its proboscis being visible protruding from its burrow while the trunk remains hidden. The trunk can be long and the proboscis . Ecology Ikeda taenioides lives in soft sediment where it digs itself a burrow, often descending to below the sand surface. The proboscis is protruded through the burrow entrance to feed, and a number of these probosces were observed by researchers in 2011, some eight months after a tsunami had devastated the seabed habitat. The tsunami had destroyed the seagrass beds, the heart urchins and the Venus clams in the community; the researchers thought the spoon worms had survived the turbulent conditions because of the depths of their burrows.

Goloubinoff (born April 4, 1957) is a Swiss-Israeli biochemist, author and activist for Yemeni immigration and the preservation of Yemeni heritage. He is also known by the pen names David Hamami or Daoud Hamami.  Biography  Pierre Goloubinoff was born in France as the third child of four of the French writers Serge Golon and Anne Golon, who in private life were called Vsevolod Goloubinoff and Simone Changeux. His father belonged to a noble Russian family exiled in France in 1920 after the 1917 revolution; he died in 1972. When Pierre Goloubinoff was two years old, his family emigrated to the city of Montana, in the canton of Valais in the Swiss Alps. In the 1960s, following the publication of stories about the Holocaust, the family decided to join the Zionist enterprise. Following their relocation to Israel, part of the Goloubinoff family converted to Judaism.  Scientific career  In 1972, Christian B. Anfinsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for seminal experiments performed mostly by his postdoctoral fellow, Michael Sela. They showed with artificially unfolded proteins that the primary amino acid sequence suffices to dictate the proper spontaneous refolding of proteins into their functional three-dimensional native structures. Yet, they also observed that proteins can often misfolded and precipitate into large insoluble aggregates. They suggested that in cells, unknown factors could possibly assist protein folding. In 1988, Goloubinoff helped follow up Anfinsen‚Äôs finding: a class of highly conserved proteins, many of which belonging to the heat shock proteins and were dubbed ‚Äúmolecular chaperones‚Äù by R. John Ellis, could mediate the assembly of protein complexes such as phages and RubisCO, preventing the formation of non-functional, protein aggregates. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of George Huntly Lorimer, Goloubinoff provided the first experimental demonstration of a mechanism by which a bacterial chaperone, GroEL, could act on the folding and assembly pathway of a recombinant RubisCO protein. They showed that in bacteria, the chaperone could prevent the aggregation of a recombinant protein, RubisCO, and promote its proper folding and assembly o r. They further showed that in the test tube the purified chaperone could also drive the proper folding of the recombinant protein. Since 1991, as a principal investigator first at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and from 2001 at the University of Lausanne, Goloubinoff contributed to further discoveries on the mechanisms of various molecular chaperones that prevent protein aggregation, promote protein folding, actively solubilize stable aggregates and can catalytically unfold stress-misfolded proteins.  Social activism  During his studies at the Weizmann Institute, Goloubinoff became interested in the fate of Jews who remained in Yemen after immigration in the 1950s (a small community remained separated from their relatives). He went there in September 1985, using his Swiss passport, and brought valuable information about them to the organizations working for them. From 1988 to 1992, in collaboration with Haim Tawil from Yeshiva University, William Wolf worked with the US government to pressure the Yemeni government to allow Jews to leave. They called their operation \\"Operation Esther\\" and presented it as a humanitarian issue unrelated to Zionism. During his visits to Yemen, Pierre Goloubinoff used the names David Hamami (with the Jews) and Daoud Hamami (with the Muslims), after realizing that Arabic speakers had difficulty pronouncing his name. When he began publishing novels in French, he adopted the name Daoud Hamami as his pen name. The theme of Yemen is dominant in his books.  Published works  Goloubinoff has written dozens of articles, theses and book chapters in biochemistry. He has also participated in the writing of publications on Yemeni heritage and in the writing of narrative texts on the subject. In the field of Yemeni heritage, he has often signed his books under the pen name Daoud Hamami. *Goloubinoff, P. (1996).
