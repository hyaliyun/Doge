Fuller was one of the most popular of the recorded Piedmont blues artists with rural African Americans along with Blind Blake, Josh White, and Buddy Moss. Life and career Allen was born in Wadesboro, North Carolina, United States, one of ten children of Calvin Allen and Mary Jane Walker. Most sources date his birth to 1907, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc indicate 1904. After the death of his mother, he moved with his father to Rockingham, North Carolina. As a boy he learned to play the guitar and also learned from older singers the field hollers, country rags, traditional songs and blues popular in poor rural areas. He married young, to Cora Allen, and worked as a laborer. He began to lose his eyesight when he was in his mid-teens. According to the researcher Bruce Bastin, \\"While he was living in Rockingham he began to have trouble with his eyes. He went to see a doctor in Charlotte who allegedly told him that he had ulcers behind his eyes, the original damage having been caused by some form of snow-blindness.\\" Only the first part of this diagnosis was correct. A 1937 eye examination attributed his vision loss to the long-term effects of untreated neonatal conjunctivitis. By 1928 he was completely blind. He turned to whatever employment he could find as a singer and entertainer, often playing in the streets. By studying the records of country blues players like Blind Blake and live performances by Gary Davis, Allen became a formidable guitarist, playing on street corners and at house parties in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Danville, Virginia; and then Durham, North Carolina. In Durham, playing around the tobacco warehouses, he developed a local following, which included the guitarists Floyd Council and Richard Trice, the harmonica player Saunders Terrell (better known as Sonny Terry), and the washboard player and guitarist George Washington. Bull City Blues historical marker, Durham, North Carolina In 1935, James Baxter Long, a record store manager and talent scout in Burlington, North Carolina, secured Allen a recording session with the American Recording Company (ARC). Allen, Davis and Washington recorded several tracks in New York City, including the traditional \\"Rag, Mama, Rag\\". To promote the records, Long credited Allen as Blind Boy Fuller and Washington as Bull City Red. Over the next five years Fuller recorded over 120 sides, which were released by several labels. His style of singing was rough and direct, and his lyrics were explicit and uninhibited, drawing on every aspect of his experience as an underprivileged, blind black man on the streets‚Äîpawnshops, jailhouses, sickness, death‚Äîwith an honesty that lacked sentimentality. Although he was not sophisticated, his artistry as a folk singer lay in the honesty and integrity of his self-expression. His songs expressed desire, love, jealousy, disappointment, menace and humor. In April 1936, Fuller recorded ten solo performances and also recorded with guitarist Floyd Council. The following year, after auditioning for J. Mayo Williams, he recorded for Decca Records, but then reverted to ARC. Later in 1937, he made his first recordings with Sonny Terry. In 1938 Fuller, who was described as having a fiery temper, was imprisoned for shooting a pistol at his wife, wounding her in the leg. His imprisonment prevented him from performing in \\"From Spirituals to Swing\\", a concert produced by John Hammond in New York City that year. Sonny Terry performed in his place; it was the beginning of Terry's long career in folk music. After Fuller was released from prison, he held his last two recording sessions, in New York City in June 1940, but by then he was increasingly physically weak, and much of the material did not match the quality and energy of his earlier recordings. Fuller's repertoire included a number of popular double-entendre \\"hokum\\" songs, such as \\"I Want Some of Your Pie\\", \\"Truckin' My Blues Away\\" (the origin of the phrase \\"keep on truckin'\\"), and \\"Get Your Yas Yas Out\\" (adapted as Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out for the title of an album by the Rolling Stones), and the autobiographical \\"Big House Bound\\", about his time in prison. Much of his material was culled from traditional folk and blues songs. He possessed a formidable fingerpicking guitar style. He played a steel National resonator guitar. He was criticised by some as a derivative musician, but his ability to fuse together elements of traditional and contemporary songs and reformulate them in his own performances attracted a broad audience. He was an expressive vocalist and a masterful guitar player, best remembered for his up-tempo ragtime hits, including \\"Step It Up and Go\\". At the same time he was capable of deeper material; his versions of \\"Lost Lover Blues\\", \\"Rattlesnakin' Daddy\\" and \\"Mamie\\" are as deep as most Delta blues. Because of his popularity, he may have been overexposed on records, but most of his songs stayed close to tradition, and much of his repertoire and style is kept alive by other Piedmont artists to this day. Allen's death certificate Death Fuller underwent a suprapubic cystostomy in July 1940, probably due to the urethral stricture noted on Fuller's death certificate, a narrowing or blockage of the urethra which can be caused by syphilitic chancres, infections from gonorrhea, or chlamydia, but continued to require medical treatment. He died at his home in Durham, North Carolina, on February 13, 1941. The cause of death was pyemia, due to an infected bladder, gastrointestinal tract and perineum, plus kidney failure. He was so popular when he died that his prot√©g√©, Brownie McGhee, recorded \\"The Death of Blind Boy Fuller\\" for Okeh Records, and then reluctantly began a short-lived career as Blind Boy Fuller No. 2, so that Columbia Records could profit from the deceased musician's popularity. Grave location Grove Hill Cemetery, Durham, North Carolina Fuller's grave is Grove Hill Cemetery, located on private property in Durham. State records indicate that this was once an official cemetery, and Fuller's interment is recorded. Only one headstone remains, that of one Mary Caston Langey. The funeral arrangements were handled by McLaurin Funeral Home of Durham, and the burial took place on February 15, 1941. Fuller has been recognized with two plaques in Durham. A plaque placed by the North Carolina Division of Archives and History is located a few miles north of Fuller's gravesite, along Fayetteville St. The city of Durham officially recognized Fuller on July 16, 2001, with a commemorative plaque located along the American Tobacco Trail, adjacent to the property where Fuller's unmarked grave is located (several hundred feet east of Fayetteville St.).  Posthumous Recognition  Blind Boy Fuller was recognized alongside Reverend Gary Davis as Main Honorees by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon them for their contributions to the Piedmont Blues.

From 1990 to 1994 the band played a few scattered live shows, each usually featuring a different lineup of band members with only Corgan having constant involvement. The band officially released two songs, \\"Delusions of Candor\\", an original composition by Corgan, and a cover of \\"Isolation\\" by Joy Division. History First appearing in 1990 (then billed as Star Children), Corgan gave the motto of the band as \\"Be repetitive for nuisance's sake.\\"\\"Smashing Pumpkins.\\" Chicago Tribune, 1990/09/07. Little is known about the early incarnation of the band, other than they played at least two shows at the Cabaret Metro with varying members including Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, Neil Jendon, Cliff Fox, and Kerry Brown (the latter three members of the band Catherine). In 1994, the band emerged with a more visible presence playing a June 18 show that received coverage as an incognito Smashing Pumpkins show, despite it being a traditional Starchildren performance. The performance that night featured several songs that would later make their way onto Smashing Pumpkins' releases. Songs performed included The Cure cover \\"A Night Like This\\" and the James Iha penned \\"The Boy\\" which were later released in The Aeroplane Flies High box set, as well as an early version of \\"Here Is No Why\\" from Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Although Starchildren was already closely associated with the band Catherine due to the groups' frequently overlapping members, this association was taken to another level by the 1994 release of the split 7\\" vinyl record \\"Songs about Girls\\"/\\"Delusions of Candor\\". One side of the record featured the Catherine song \\"Songs about Girls\\" while the reverse featured the Starchildren tune \\"Delusions of Candor\\". Delusions of Candor featured Billy Corgan's then best friend, and Smashing Pumpkins first manager and guitar technician Bob English on bass, but he only got a \\"thanks to\\" credit on the single and received no compensation of any kind. This is the only original Starchildren composition released to date. In 1995, the band's cover of Joy Division's \\"Isolation\\" appeared on the tribute album A Means to an End: The Music of Joy Division. In January 2010, Corgan announced plans to start a new record label, which may release new material from Starchildren.

Originally constructed for the Royal Navy as HMS Apollo, the ship entered service in 1936, and was sold to Australia two years later. During the war, Hobart was involved in the evacuation of British Somaliland in 1940, fought at the Battle of the Coral Sea and supported the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Tulagi in 1942. She was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1943, then returned to service in 1945 and supported the landings at Tarakan, Wewak, Brunei, and Balikpapan. Hobart was placed in reserve in 1947, but plans to modernise her and return her to service as an aircraft carrier escort, training ship, or guided missile ship were not followed through. The cruiser was sold for scrapping in 1962. Design and construction The ship was one of three Modified Leander-class light cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy. The main difference to the previous five Leanders was that the newer ships had their machinery and propulsion equipment organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each machinery space, gave the modified ships a different profile from the early Leanders, which had a single funnel.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 15 To cover the separate machinery spaces, the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 15‚Äì16 During design, it was planned to modify the forward- most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship's top speed and causing problems with effective fire control.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 16 The cruiser was laid down at HM Dockyard, Devonport, England on 15 August 1933 as HMS Apollo.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 124 She was launched on 9 October 1934 by Lady Florence, wife of Admiral Sir William Boyle. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 13 January 1936. Operational history =Royal Navy service= Apollo berthed in Miami, Florida in 1938 Apollo served on the North American and West Indies Station until 1938.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 73 =Australian acquisition= The ship was purchased by the Australian Government in 1938, with the transfer of the seaplane tender to the Royal Navy as part of the payment. She was originally to be renamed and transferred to the RAN on 6 October, but the mobilisation of the British Home Fleet in response to the Munich Crisis brought this forward to 28 September. The cruiser arrived in Australia at the end of 1938, and visited her namesake city during February 1939. =World War II= At the start of World War II, Hobart was initially deployed on patrols of Bass Strait. A month later, on 13 October, the cruiser sailed for Singapore with several RAN destroyers. After arrival, she was assigned to patrol and convoy escort duties in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. In February 1940, she escorted an Australian troop convoy from Colombo to the Middle East, then spent time in Ceylon as flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, before being transferred to Aden with in April to form the core of the Royal Navy's Red Sea Force. The cruiser fired in anger for the first time on 12 June 1940, in retaliation to Italian aircraft attacking Aden. On 19 June, the cruiser's Walrus amphibious aircraft dropped bombs on an Italian wireless station on Centre Peak Island in the Red Sea. At the start of August, Hobart escorted a relief force to Berbera, in response to the Italian invasion of British Somaliland. Two weeks later, the decision was made to abandon British Somaliland, and Hobart was designated headquarters for the evacuation. The Walrus was used to successfully fend off air raids and bomb the Italian headquarters at Zeila, while a 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun was converted into an anti-tank gun and sent to assist in the rearguard action, although the three volunteers crewing the weapon were captured. Hobarts captain orchestrated the evacuation of over 7,000 soldiers and civilians aboard a heterogenous flotilla of vessels. The cruiser was the last ship to leave on 19 August, collecting stragglers in the ship's boats while demolition teams and the ship's guns destroyed anything of value. HMAS Hobart in Brisbane in 1939 Hobart remained in the Red Sea until October, when she sailed to Colombo for refit, then returned to Australia. Shortly after arrival, Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace transferred his flag from to Hobart.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 125 The cruiser was used as an escort in Australian waters until June 1941, when the ship's seaplane and catapult were removed, Crace transferred his flag back to Canberra, and Hobart was sent to the Mediterranean to relieve sister ship . On 13 July, Hobart was in Port Tewfik when the area was bombed. The troopship Georgic was damaged by bombs and attempted to beach, but collided with the transport Gleneran and forced her ashore as well. Hobarts company helped to evacuate crew and passengers from the ships during the evening, and helped to refloat Georgic the next day. On joining the Mediterranean Fleet, Hobart was assigned to support Allied forces during the Western Desert Campaign until December 1941, when the Japanese declaration of war required the ship to relocate to Australian waters. The cruiser was diverted to escort a convoy from Colombo to Singapore; the ships arrived on 3 January, the same day as a Japanese air raid. Hobart reached Fremantle on 11 January, then escorted a convoy to Java before the month's end. On 3 February 1942, while sailing from Singapore to Batavia, Hobart and the destroyer came to the aid of the merchant ship Norah Moller, which had been bombed by three aircraft. The cruiser collected 57 of the 70 aboard, with the rest aboard Tenedos. From this point, the ship was almost constantly deployed on convoy escort duties with the Eastern Fleet. On 25 February, the cruiser was attacked by 27 bombers while refuelling from a tanker at Tanjong Priok.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 74 There was only minor damage, but the fuelling operation could not be completed, and Hobart was unable to join the Allied force that was defeated during the Battle of the Java Sea two days later. At the start of May, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and Hobart was sent with to rendezvous with United States forces in the Coral Sea.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 41 At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral Crace, embarked aboard Australia as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (Australia, Hobart, US cruiser , and US destroyers , , and ) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 47 The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired on a group of eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06; no ships were damaged for the loss of five aircraft.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 48‚Äì50 At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships; no ships were hit directly, the only casualties (aboard Chicago) were from shrapnel.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 50 A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 52 The task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 53 On 7 August, Hobart supported the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Tulagi. The damage from a torpedo attack against Hobart on 20 July 1943 On the evening of 20 July 1943, while sailing to Espiritu Santo as part of Task Force 74, Hobart was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 291 The torpedo struck the port quarter and caused serious damage. The damage included significant structural damage around the wardroom, and the loss of electricity supply and steering control. Seven officers and six sailors were killed, while another six officers and one sailor were injured. No submarine was detected prior to or after the attack, and post-attack reconstructions concluded that the unidentified submarine, positioned ahead of the eastward-sailing task force, saw the ships silhouetted against the sunset and fired a spread of torpedoes at Australia from at least ; these missed the heavy cruiser, and the torpedo at one edge of the fan impacted against Hobart instead. After electrical power and steering were restored, the cruiser limped to Espiritu Santo under the escort of and for temporary repairs, which were performed by , then sailed for Australia on 21 August with the destroyers and escorting.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 292 The cruiser arrived in Sydney on 26 August, and was docked at Cockatoo Island Dockyard for repairs and refurbishment; the quantity of damage meant that she was out of service until 1945.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 73‚Äì5 Following her return, Hobart was involved in the landing at Tarakan on 25 April 1945, at Wewak on 11 May, at Brunei in June, and at Balikpapan in July. Hobart entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August, and was present for Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Following the war, Hobart spent 1946 and 1947 in Japanese waters.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 75 Hobart received eight battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Mediterranean 1941\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1941\\", \\"Coral Sea 1942\\", \\"Savo Island 1942\\", \\"Guadacanal 1942\\", \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì45\\", \\"East Indies 1940\\", and \\"Borneo 1945\\". Hobart exercising with off Subic Bay in August 1945 Decommissioning and fate Hobart was paid off into the reserve fleet on 20 December 1947. In 1950, following the failure to find a suitable new British cruiser design, and a dollar shortage preventing the purchase of US vessels, it was decided to modernise Hobart and use her as a stop-gap aircraft carrier escort until the destroyers entered service, after which she would serve as a troop convoy escort to the Middle East in the event of a future conflict.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, pp. 148‚Äì9 This planned role changed in 1952 following a series of financial cutbacks and the realisation that the destroyers were suitable carrier escorts; instead, Hobart was to replace Australia as the training cruiser. She was taken to the State Dockyard, Newcastle for modification. During 1953 and 1954, further reductions in the RAN saw one carrier taken off active duty for use as a training vessel, eliminating the need to return Hobart to service. Other options for reactivating the cruiser were explored, including conversion to a guided missile ship, but by April 1955, all proposals were abandoned. Despite the conversion work to date having cost ¬£A1 million, the modification was cancelled, and Hobart was returned to the reserve fleet and marked for disposal. Hobart was sold for scrap on 22 February 1962 to Japanese firm Mitsui & Co (Aust) Pty Ltd. The ship left Sydney under tow on 3 March, and arrived in Osaka on 2 April for breaking up.

Built in the United States of America to a slight variant of the United States Navy (USN) , she was commissioned into the RAN in 1965. In March 1967, Hobart became the first RAN combat ship deployed to fight in the Vietnam War. This marked the start of consistent six-month deployments to the warzone, which continued until late 1971; Hobart was redeployed in 1969 and 1970. During the 1968 tour, the destroyer was attacked by a United States Air Force aircraft. After the Vietnam War, Hobart saw service during Operation Navy Help Darwin; the RAN disaster relief effort following Cyclone Tracy, was the first RAN ship to dock at in Western Australia, and completed a round-the- world voyage in 1976. The ship was modernised during the late 1970s. Hobart was decommissioned in 2000, and sunk as a dive wreck off South Australia. Design and construction Hobart was one of three guided missile destroyers built for the RAN.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 39 Based on the United States Navy's , Hobart had a displacement of 3,370 tons at standard load, and 4,618 tons at full load, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a maximum draught of .Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 30 Propulsion was provided by two General Electric turbines, which provided to the destroyer's two propeller shafts. Hobart could achieve speeds of . The ship's company consisted of 20 officers and 312 sailors. As a guided missile destroyer, Hobarts main armament consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher firing Tartar missiles and two Ikara anti-submarine missile launchers. This was supplemented by two 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets.Chant, A compendium of armaments and military hardware, p. 208 Over the course of the ship's career, the Mark 13 launcher was modified to fire Standard missiles, the Ikara launchers were stripped out in 1989, and two Phalanx CIWS units were installed in 1991. Hobart was laid down by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company at Bay City, Michigan on 26 October 1962. The ship was launched on 9 January 1964 by the wife of David Hay, the Australian ambassador to the United Nations. Hobart was commissioned into the RAN on 18 December 1965. The cost of the destroyer was approximately A$45 million, including the initial load of supplies and ammunition.

After commissioning, Hobart remained in American waters for eight months on trials and training exercises. She left the US on 3 August 1966, and sailed via Hawaii and Fiji before reaching her namesake city on 1 September. The ship spent very little time in Australian waters before she was deployed to fight in the Vietnam War in March 1967. Operational history =Vietnam deployments= During the mid-1960s, the United States government pressured Australia to increase the resources it was committing to the Vietnam War; one of the requests was for a combat vessel to help the USN meet the demand for naval gunfire support operations.Grey, Up Top, pgs. 132, 138-9 The idea of deploying a RAN combat ship to the Vietnam War was initially hampered by the number of ships available, particularly with commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve and involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, along with the difficulty of operating and maintaining British-designed ships with USN resources.Grey, Up Top, pgs. 76, 80 On 14 December 1966, the Australian Cabinet approved the deployment of Hobart as part of increases to Australian military commitment to the conflict.Grey, Up Top, p. 81 Destroyers deployed to the Vietnam theatre generally operated in one of four roles: * Patrols along the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon to interdict coastal shipping, with secondary attacks on inland supply lines and military targets, along with coastal defence sites that had fired on American and Australian ships.Grey, Up Top, pp. 125-30 Ships assigned to Sea Dragon were normally split into a northern and southern unit (although during 1967 up to four units were operating at any time), with each unit made up of two to three ships.Grey, Up Top, p. 129 However, the Australian government forbade RAN vessels from operating in the northern area.Grey, Up Top, p. 141 * Naval gunfire support operations to assist ground forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps units operating closest to the North Vietnam border.Grey, Up Top, pp. 130-5 Seven ships were usually stationed on the 'gunline', and attacks fell into two categories: 'unspotted' shelling of areas where North Vietnamese or Viet Cong forces and facilities were known or believed to be, and 'spotted' fire missions in direct support of ground troops.Grey, Up Top, p. 132 During these operations, Hobart operated under the callsign \\"Royal Purple\\".Grey, Up Top, p. 155 * Anti-infiltration operations under Operation Market Time, which aimed to stop the logistic supply and reinforcement of Viet Cong units operating in South Vietnam by tracking, intercepting, and searching coastal shipping.Grey, Up Top, p. 135-8 RAN destroyers were never formally assigned to Market Time, but the overlap of the gunline and Market Time operational areas meant the ships were often called on to assist by tracking suspicious ships or participating in raids.Grey, Up Top, p. 135 * Escort of USN aircraft carriers involved in Operation Rolling Thunder airstrikes.Grey, Up Top, p. 125 Although RAN ships on deployment were expected to fulfil all duties of an equivalent American destroyer, they were forbidden by the Australian government from operating outside the Vietnam theatre on unrelated Seventh Fleet duties (such as the Taiwan Patrol Force, guard ship duties at Hong Kong, or the Space Recovery Program).Grey, Up Top, pp. 140-1 After the invasion of Cambodia in 1970, RAN ships were also prohibited from entering Cambodian waters. While deployed to Vietnam, the destroyer's were placed under the administrative control of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam in addition to that of the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet.Grey, Up Top, pp. 82-3 Operationally, the RAN vessels were under the command of the United States Seventh Fleet.Grey, Up Top, p. 82 Arrangements were made to provide logistic support through the United States Pacific Fleet. A USN lieutenant was assigned to each ship during deployments to act as a liaison with the Seventh Fleet.Grey, Up Top, p. 144 The deployment of Hobart in March 1967 began a pattern of six-month deployments for RAN destroyers, with a constant RAN presence with the Seventh Fleet.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 204 Australia was the only allied nation to provide naval support to the United States Navy during the Vietnam War.Grey, Up Top, pp. 94-5 First deployment On 15 March 1967, Hobart arrived at Subic to join the Seventh Fleet.Grey, Up Top, p. 142 After a comprehensive familiarisation period, Hobart replaced on 31 March, taking over the US destroyer's gunfire support duties. By 04:45 the next morning, the Australian ship had already fired 100 rounds.Grey, Up Top, p. 145 On 3 April, the forward 5-inch gun mount became unserviceable, a state which remained for four-and-a-half-days. Hobart remained on the gunline until 15 April, during which she fired 1,651 shells.Grey, Up Top, pp. 145-6 She was then rotated to Sea Dragon operations.Grey, Up Top, p. 146 The destroyer was fired on by shore batteries several times, and on one occasion took minor shrapnel damage.Grey, Up Top, p. 147 Several explosions in 5-inch/54 gun mounts during the later weeks of April saw all equipped destroyers (including Hobart) reassigned to other duties while investigations into the cause (believed to be a bad batch of ammunition) were explored.Grey, Up Top, p. 148 Hobart was attached to the carrier escort group for on 23 April. On 29 April, the destroyer sailed to Subic, underwent self-maintenance, then returned to Sea Dragon operations.Grey, Up Top, pp. 148-9 Over the next week, Hobart and cooperated on the interdiction of coastal shipping during a period of heavy activity; previous successes saw the North Vietnamese begin to increase retaliation with coastal artillery in an attempt to dissuade American operations.Grey, Up Top, p. 149 Apart from a brief stint on the gunline, Hobart remained assigned to Sea Dragon until 26 May, when sailed to Subic for maintenance, with both 5-inch gun barrels replaced.Grey, Up Top, p. 150 Hobart replenishing from during her first Vietnam War deployment After delays caused by monsoonal conditions, the Australian warship returned to the gunline on 18 June.Grey, Up Top, p. 151 During this period, the destroyer was also called on to escort the amphibious warfare ships involved in the Beacon Torch landings. After mid-June, the number of fire missions undertaken by Hobart dropped because of a need to conserve 5-inch/54 ammunition across the Seventh Fleet, and the fact that Marines in the area had successfully established their own artillery units in the area and were less reliant on naval gunfire. On 23 June, Hobart rotated to Sea Dragon. A reduction in the number of seaborne infiltration attempts and the increasing availability of spotter aircraft meant that most gunfire missions were against inland targets like truck convoys.Grey, Up Top, p. 152 On 10 July, the destroyer left the operational area and sailed to Subic via Hong Kong, and underwent self-maintenance. This was completed on 24 July, and Hobart sailed for the operational area.Grey, Up Top, pp. 152-3 The ship was double tasked to the escort group and Sea Dragon operations; three destroyers were required to escort the carrier at any time, with any additional ships operating on Sea Dragon duties.Grey, Up Top, p. 153 On 29 July, a fire aboard the carrier necessitated her removal from the operational area; Hobart was one of the ships assigned to escort and assist with casualties. The Australian ship returned to Sea Dragon operations on 31 July. This continued until 16 August, and after maintenance at Subic, Hobart was attached to the gunline on 6 September.Grey, Up Top, p. 154 On 14 September, Hobart arrived in Subic, handed over responsibility to , and sailed for home. During this deployment, Hobart fired over 10,000 rounds at 1,050 targets during 160 days at sea, and was fired on ten times, with no casualties. Hobart was awarded the United States Navy Unit Commendation for this tour of duty. Personnel awards included a Distinguished Service Order, a British Empire Medal, a Mention in Despatches, and 25 Naval Board commendations. Second deployment Hobart was deployed to Vietnam for the second time in 1968, relieving Perth on 31 March.Grey, Up Top, p. 170 On 13 April, the destroyer arrived on the gunline to relieve .Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 121 Five days later, she began Sea Dragon operations with .Grey, Up Top, p. 172 The ships were unsuccessfully shelled by coastal artillery on 22 and 23 April, then spent the next three days attempting to attract attention from shore batteries so they could be bombed by aircraft. Hobarts participation in Sea Dragon ended in late April, and after maintenance in Hong Kong and Taiwan from 1 to 20 May, she resumed gunline duties.Grey, Up Top, p. 173 This continued until 2 June, when the destroyer's guns required new barrels. On 11 June, the destroyer returned to the Sea Dragon area of operations, joining .Grey, Up Top, p. 174 During this deployment, boat traffic between the mainland and Tiger Island was seen as a priority, with gunline ships also granted approval to operate against targets in this area. Early in the month, problems with the 5-inch/54 guns aboard Hobart and several US destroyers appeared; Hobarts captain decided to only fire the guns in emergencies until the problem was clearly identified.Grey, Up Top, p. 175 The destroyer joined Hobart and Chandler to make up for the lack of firepower. During the evening of 16‚Äì17 June, the three destroyers were ordered to undertake surveillance missions around Tiger Island, because of reports of North Vietnamese helicopter activity in the area.Grey, Up Top, pp. 175-6 At 03:09, Hobarts radar picked up an aircraft approaching with no IFF transponder active.Grey, Up Top, p. 176 At 03:14, the aircraft fired a single missile at the ship, which killed one sailor, wounded two others, and damaged the chief petty officer's mess, air search radar and missile control compartments, and the ship's funnels.Grey, Up Top, pgs. 176, 178 Two minutes later, the aircraft made a second pass and fired two missiles.Grey, Up Top, p. 178 The missiles hit simultaneously: one penetrated the superstructure and damaged the gunners' store, engineers workshop, and aft seamans' mess, while the other hit close to the original missile, causing further damage to the mess and missile control room, while also damaging the Tartar checkout room, killing another sailor, and wounded six others.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 122 There was also major damage around the destroyer's Ikara magazine, but as Hobart was not carrying any Ikara missiles at the time, the potential magazine fire did not occur.Grey, Up Top, p. 181 The aircraft came around for a third attack run, but was scared off when Hobarts forward gun turret, under independent control, fired five rounds at the aircraft.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 123Grey, Up Top, p. 179 At 03:30, Edson reported coming under fire, and Hobart captain ordered the three destroyers to take up anti-aircraft formation. At 05:15, the three destroyers linked up with the cruiser USS Boston (which had been hit by a missile from another aircraft) and the escorting destroyer , and continued anti-aircraft manoeuvring. After being relieved, Hobart sailed for Subic Bay, where the damage was inspected by RAN and USN personnel, including three admirals. Debris collected from Hobart and the other ships indicated that the missiles were of United States Air Force (USAF) origin.Grey, Up Top, pp. 179-80 Damage to Hobart from the USAF missile The attacks on Hobart and the other ships were the capstone of a series of firing incidents between 15 and 17 June, and an inquiry was held by the USN into the incidents, with three RAN personnel attending as technical advisors.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 124 The inquiry found that a few hours before the attack on Hobart, Swift Boats PCF-12 and PCF-19, along with , were attacked by what they identified at the time as hovering enemy aircraft, but were believed to be friendly planes; PCF-19 was sunk in the attack.Frame, Pacific Partners, pp. 123‚Äì5Grey, Up Top, p. 180 F-4 Phantoms of the USAF Seventh Air Force, responding several hours after the attack on the Swift Boats, were unable to distinguish between the radar signature of surface ships and airborne helicopters, and instead opened fire on Hobart, Boston, and Edson. Hobart underwent repairs in Subic Bay, and returned to duty on the gunline on 25 July.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 125 During the evening of 27 July, Hobart was involved in another friendly fire incident; this time, shells from the ship fell close to a marine unit's command post and injured three marines.Grey, Up Top, pp. 183-4 The fault was found to be with the marine unit's spotter, who was inexperienced, failed to signal the close proximity of friendly units to the target, and failed to fully identify the target before calling for five rounds of shellfire. Although Hobart was asked to rotate Sea Dragon duties on 2 August to relieve a destroyer experiencing gunnery faults, nine days early, the destroyer's captain refused, as he wanted more time to prepare the ship after the repairs, particularly as the air warning radars were yet to become operational, and the gun mounts were experiencing minor problems.Grey, Up Top, p. 184 The Sea Dragon deployment did not eventuate, and after operating near the Demilitarized Zone, Hobart was reassigned to gunfire support duties around southern Vietnam on 12 August.Grey, Up Top, p. 185 On 22 August, the destroyer fired to support the 1st Australian Task Force in Phuoc Tuy Province: the first time a RAN destroyer provided naval gunfire support for Australian soldiers in the war.Grey, Up Top, p. 187 On 29 September, Perth relieved Hobart at Subic, and Hobart sailed for home.Grey, Up Top, p. 189 One sailor was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his actions during the 17 June attack (the government received advice that as it was a friendly fire incident, a non-combat medal like the British Empire Medal should be awarded instead, but this was ignored), while two Mentions in Despatches and 23 Naval Board commendations were also issued.Grey, Up Top, p. 188 Third deployment Hobart returned to Vietnam for her third tour on 28 March 1970, taking over from the destroyer .Grey, Up Top, p. 216 After working up, the destroyer relieved from gunline duties on 6 April. On 21 April, the ship moved north to near the Demilitarized Zone.Grey, Up Top, p. 217 Three days later, the destroyer rammed and sank a South Vietnamese fishing craft, but rescued the five crew and transported them to shore. At the end of April, the ship sailed to Subic for maintenance.Grey, Up Top, p. 218 After this was completed, Hobart returned to gunline duties on 11 May, and remained on station until 24 May, when the destroyer sailed to Singapore for maintenance.Grey, Up Top, pp. 218-9 Hobart resumed gunline operations on 6 June; these continued until 28 June, when she sailed to Subic for rebarrelling.Grey, Up Top, pp. 219-20 She returned to the gunline on 9 July, and operated until 29 August, when she sailed to Singapore for maintenance, then Bangkok for naval exercises.Grey, Up Top, pgs. 220, 222 Returning on 13 September, Hobart was called to relieve on the gunline after an explosion in one of the American destroyer's gun mounts.Grey, Up Top, p. 222 On 22 September, Hobart sailed to Subic. The destroyer was relieved by Perth on 26 September.Grey, Up Top, p. 224 Two personnel were mentioned in despatches, and 23 Naval Board commendations were issued for the deployment. During 1971, the Australian government decided to withdraw all forces from Vietnam by the end of the year.Grey, Up Top, p. 96 Hobart made no further deployments to Vietnam, and after completed her assigned operations in September 1971, no further RAN ships were deployed to the warzone for combat operations. Hobart received the battle honour \\"Vietnam 1967‚Äì70\\" for her wartime service, adding to the eight honours inherited from the previous ship of the name. =1970s‚Äì1980s= Hobart (second row from left, bottom) cruises as part of a joint US-Australian battle group around the US Navy battleship In 1972, Hobart underwent modernisation in the US.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 40 In June 1974, the destroyer was involved in the exercise Kangaroo One. On 15 October, Hobart departed from Sydney with for a five-week tour of Australian and New Zealand ports. While in her namesake city, Hobart was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales; the first time the royal had boarded an Australian warship. On 27 December 1974, Hobart sailed from Sydney as one of thirteen RAN ships involved in Operation Navy Help Darwin; the RAN disaster relief effort following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy on 24‚Äì25 December 1974. Later in the year, the destroyer participated in the multinational exercise RIMPAC 75, then embarked on a three-month deployment in the Indian Ocean, during which Hobart became the first RAN ship to visit Mal√© in the Maldives, and the first warship to dock at , the new naval base in Western Australia. Between May and September 1976, Hobart sailed on a round- the-world voyage; the 109-day deployment was named Exercise Phineas Fogg after the main character from Around the World in Eighty Days. During this voyage, the ship visited nineteen ports in twelve countries, and represented Australia at the fleet review off New York commemorating the United States Bicentennial. During 1977 and 1978, Hobart underwent a half-life modernisation, during which the propulsion system was converted from furnace oil to diesel fuel, and a Naval Combat Data System was installed. In July 1979, Hobart and the Antarctic Support Vessel Thala Dan were sent to Macquarie Island to retrieve a badly injured researcher and return him to Australia.Forbes, RAN Activities in the Southern Ocean In order to transfer the researcher to the ship, Hobarts personnel constructed a makeshift helipad, which was used by Thala Dans helicopter to deliver the injured man to the destroyer. Hobart remained in Australian waters during the early 1980s, with the exception of deployments to Hawaii for RIMPAC, to the North West Indian Ocean for 6 months in 1981 and participation in Kangaroo exercises. The destroyer underwent refit in 1984. In 1985, Hobart sailed to Canada to represent Australia at a naval review recognising the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy's founding. During 1986, the ship was deployed to South-east Asia, which was repeated in 1987. During early 1988, the destroyer participated in activities celebrating Australia's Bicentenary, then later in the year sailed to join the RIMPAC exercise. In 1989, the destroyer's Ikara launchers were removed during a refit. =1990s‚Äì2000= Hobart visited New Zealand in 1991 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Royal New Zealand Navy. During 1992, the destroyer participated in RIMPAC. In 1993, Hobart visited South-east Asia, then participated in the first Exercise Kakadu. The ship returned to Hawaii for RIMPAC 94, and was assigned command of one of the exercise task groups. In 1995, the ship was again deployed to South-east Asia, participated in celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Pacific War's end, and visited New Zealand.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 41 Hobart won the Gloucester Cup for 1995, a trophy awarded to the most efficient ship of the RAN during a calendar year; this was the eighth time the Cup was won by the destroyer. The ship was docked for refit for most of 1996, with post-refit trials extending into 1997. During early 1998, Hobart was deployed to exercises in New Zealand, then sailed to Queensland in May. From August until December, the ship, accompanied by HMA Ships , , and , visited ports in Indonesia and South-east Asia. Hobart spent most of 1999 either alongside in Sydney, or on exercises in Jervis Bay. Decommissioning and fate Hobarts galley in 2010 Hobart paid off on 12 May 2000. She was gifted to the South Australian government in August 2000. The ship was sunk as a dive wreck on 5 November 2002 in Yankalilla Bay, South Australia at , west-north-west of Marina St. Vincent. The wreck site is officially known as the Fleurieu Artificial Reef. The scuttled ship is scheduled as a historic shipwreck as per the South Australian Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981 and has a protected zone of radius which prohibits boating activity unless the operator has a permit.

Species Menticirrhus americanus - Southern kingfish: This species grows to 20 inches (51 cm) in length. Seven to eight dark bands mark the sides which shade from dusky above to almost white on the belly, and the inside of the operculum has a dusky coloration. They are found from the Western Caribbean Sea to Cape Cod and most of South and Central America's east coast, over sand or mud in depths of at least 5 feet (1.5 m). This species is prized for its flesh, and is fished both commercially and recreationally. Menticirrhus littoralis - Gulf kingfish: The body is silvery in color, lacks a dusky operculum and occurs in the surf zone from the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. In all other respects it is similar to M. americanus. Menticirrhus saxatilis - Northern kingfish: The size, habits, range and fishery is similar to M. americanus. The coloration is the same too, except for a dark V-shaped mark on the shoulder. Menticirrhus undulatus - California Corbina Fishing for kingcroakers Kingfish caught from the Great South Bay. Though not as highly prized for sport as other fish may be, kingcroakers (also known as whiting in Florida and sea mullet in North Carolina) have the ability to pull out some little, zippy runs. Most specimens that are caught are half a pound or less, but some can reach one or even two pounds. Kingcroakers are most often caught in the surf, but are sometimes found off piers near inlets or in bays. Good lures include small jigs, small spoons, and small plastics. The bait fisherman is best suited with sand fleas or molecrabs, which can be bought frozen at almost any tackle shop or caught live on the beach (look for Vs in the sand pointing towards shore when a wave starts to recede, and start digging a couple inches until you feel a sand flea). Cut shrimp is a close second. In Long Island New York's Captree State Park, these fish are simply known as \\"kingfish.\\" They average in size from 12 inches to 14 inches. Clams seem to be the best bait to catch them. Cooking kingcroakers Most kingcroakers are too small to fillet, so pan-dressing them is usually the way they are cooked. When big enough they produce mild, but good fillets. A fish fry is best suited for kingcroakers.

Stock footage is beneficial to filmmakers as it saves shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is called a \\"stock shot\\" or a \\"library shot\\".Ephraim Katz, The Film Encyclopedia, Crowell, 1979. Stock footage may have appeared in previous productions but may also be outtakes or footage shot for previous productions and not used. Examples of stock footage that might be utilized are moving images of cities and landmarks, wildlife in their natural environments, and historical footage. Suppliers of stock footage may be either rights managed or royalty-free. Many websites offer direct downloads of clips in various formats. History Stock footage companies began to emerge in the mid-1980s, offering clips mastered on Betacam SP, VHS, and film formats. Many of the smaller libraries that specialized in niche topics such as extreme sports, technological or cultural collections were bought out by larger concerns such as Corbis or Getty Images over the next couple of decades. Films and television Stock footage can be used to integrate news footage or notable figures into a film. For instance, the Academy Award-winning film Forrest Gump used stock footage extensively, modified with computer-generated imagery to portray the lead character meeting such historic figures such as John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon. Videographer captures stock footage of a passing train outside Las Vegas: photograph by Patty Mooney. News programs use film footage from their libraries when more recent images are not available. Such usage is often labeled on-screen with an indication that the footage being shown is file footage. Television and movies series also often recycle footage taken from previous installments. For instance, the Star Trek franchise kept a large collection of starships, planets, backgrounds, and explosions, which would appear on a regular basis throughout Star Trek's five series and ten films, being used with minimal alteration. That kept production costs down as models, mattes, and explosions were expensive to create. The advances in computer graphics in the late 1990s and early 2000s helped to significantly reduce the cost of Star Trek's production, and allowed for a much wider variety of shots than previous model and painting based visuals. Other films that re-used film footage from previous productions include Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Blade Runner, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Hitman, Jaws: The Revenge, Halloween II, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Some series, particularly those made for children, such as Power Rangers or Teletubbies, reuse footage that is shown in many episodes. Meant for a young audience, the approach increases viewers' familiarity between shows. This introduces problems such as the requirement to, for example, wear the same clothing and inconsistency can sometimes become a problem. When cleverly filmed it is possible to avoid many of these problems. Many broadcast shows use stock- footage clips as establishing shots of a particular city, which imply that the show is shot on location when in fact, it may be shot in a backlot studio. One or two establishing shots of an exotic location such as the Great Wall of China, Easter Island, or French Polynesia will save production companies the major costs of transporting crew and equipment to those actual locations. Stock footage is often used in commercials when there is not enough money or time for production. More often than not these commercials are political or issue-oriented in nature. Sometimes it can be used to composite moving images that create the illusion of having on-camera performers appear to be on location. The term B-roll may refer to stock footage or newly shot scenes. Stock footage that appears on television screens or monitors shown in movies or television shows is referred to as \\"playback\\". In Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, which was written by and starring Will Ferrell as a San Diego news anchor, the studio purchased archival 1970s clips from San Diego stock footage firm New & Unique Videos. The playback footage of a hurricane featured in Disney's Smart House came from the vaults of the same San Diego firm. One of the most common uses of stock footage is in documentaries. Use of stock footage allows the filmmaker to tell the story of historical events such as World War II Why We Fight series, to document modern underwater archaeology activities, or to supplement content in natural history documentaries. Budgets may not be sufficient to keep a production crew on site for long term projects, and stock footage allows the producer to pick the moments in time that are most important to the story or to give context to historical events. Several films that would otherwise be completely lost have surviving footage due to the film being used as a stock footage. For example, The Cat Creeps has some scenes preserved in the movie Boo, and scenes from Queen of the Night Clubs are preserved as stock footage in Winner Take All. If not for the use of stock footage, these films would be lost entirely. Stock Footage are also used in live reality TV shows such as I'm a Celebrity. Most of the stock footage used in that show is footage that is related to jungle creatures and insects. There is one stock video in particular that lasts for four seconds and excites people: a short video of a spider catching a fly and spinning it in a web. The makers of the stock footage added some cartoon sounds to the video to entertain people. Corporate usage The 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band, USMC, performs in San Diego, 2011: still shot from stock footage clip. Companies throughout the world use stock footage in their video productions for in-house meetings, annual conventions, seminars, and other events. It has become popular to videotape interviews of CEOs and other VIPs using a green screen backdrop. When the green is keyed out during post-production, stock footage or stock shots are inserted, to impart a particular message. Public domain One of the largest producers of public domain stock footage is the United States government. All videos produced by the United States military, NASA, and other agencies are available for use as stock footage. There are a number of companies that own the copyrights to large libraries of stock footage and charge filmmakers a fee for using it, but they rarely demand royalties. Stock footage comes from a myriad of sources including the public domain, other movies and television programs, news outlets, and purpose-shot stock footage. Format =Evolution= Comparison of common broadcast resolutions With each introduction of new standard, it requires reshooting, rerendering, or rescanning the popular footage as well as new images to show the capabilities of the next standard. Betacam SP, VHS, and early digital footage was shot in Standard Definition (SD), in 4:3 aspect ratio. Next came a higher resolution format, High Definition (HD), with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is closer to cinema widescreen formats. Many stock-footage companies and producers were concerned that their libraries would become irrelevant. Most stock footage companies & distributors now require HD 1080p footage at a minimum with many requesting 2K resolution and 4K resolution raw footage. Many companies are also including Virtual Reality (VR) and 360-degree video footage. =Container= Popular digital container formats include MOV (QuickTime File Format) AVI, FLV, MP4, and MXF, which are commonly used in non-linear editing system applications such as Avid, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere Pro.

She served in the Second World War and was an early casualty, being sunk in an air attack off Norway in May 1940. Description The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to lend gun support to the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding .Lenton, p. 164 The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.English, p. 14 They had an overall length of , a beam of Lenton, p. 165 and a draught of .English, p. 12 The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships' complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men for the Captain (D) and his staff.Whitley, p. 99 The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four twin-gun mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" AA gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun.Hodges, pp. 13‚Äì25 The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships;Hodges, pp. 30‚Äì31, 40 Twenty depth charges were the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.English, p. 15  Construction and career  She was ordered from the Newcastle-upon-Tyne yards of Vickers-Armstrong on 10 March 1936 under the 1935 Build Programme. She was laid down on 9 June that year and was launched on 8 June 1937 by Lady Foster. Also launched on that same day from the same yard was , Afridis sister ship. Afridi was completed and commissioned on 3 May 1938 at a cost of ¬£341,462 which excluded supply of weapons and communications outfits by the Admiralty. During her trials Afridi made at 355.6 RPM with at .March, p.362 = Pre-war in the Mediterranean = Her acceptance trials took place on 29 April 1938 in a rising gale, but all went well and she was accepted. On commissioning, Afridi was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla, with the Mediterranean Fleet, which consisted of other Tribal-class destroyers. She left Portland Harbour on 27 May for Malta, arriving there on 3 June. In July, she left Malta to patrol the waters off the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Afridi, in common with all other Royal Navy vessels in these waters, had broad, red, white and blue bands painted on her 'B' gun-mounting so that Spanish Republican and Nationalist aircraft could identify the neutral British. By 18 September 1938, Afridi arrived at Istanbul, Turkey, for a formal visit. The Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia caused the remainder of the Black Sea cruise to be cancelled. Afridi then sailed for Alexandria, Egypt for a short stay then left to rejoin the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in Malta. On 23 February 1939, Afridi steamed to Gibraltar where the Mediterranean and Home Fleets were gathering for combined exercises. These consisted of over one hundred ships and thirteen Admirals, and resulted in the testing and evaluation of many aspects of naval warfare. Afridi was later withdrawn from the exercises after colliding with the cruiser during the transfer of mail. Afridi returned to Malta for repairs. After the repairs were completed, she was transferred to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla and sailed to join it at Alexandria. The rest of the pre-war period was spent on exercises and port visits. = Wartime in the North Sea = Italy, which British planners were concerned might enter a war against Britain, took steps to prove her neutrality so the convoy escorts and blockade controls which were anticipated could no longer be justified. The 4th Destroyer Flotilla was therefore ordered back to England. From now on, the flotilla virtually lost its identity and each Tribal was assigned individual duties by the Flag Officer under whose command she came. Afridi was assigned to service in the North Sea with the Humber Force, based at Immingham. In December she was moved to Rosyth to carry out convoy escort duties between the UK and Norway. By January 1940, a number of defects had become noticeable, including leaks and problems with turbine blades caused Afridi to undergo repairs at a commercial shipyard in West Hartlepool. These repairs lasted throughout February and into March. She rejoined active service in April, under the command of Captain Philip Vian, when she carried out screening duties and escorts for convoys off the Norwegian coast. During these operations she came under heavy and sustained air attacks. The destroyer was sunk and the battleship , and cruisers and were damaged. Afridi escaped damage and returned to refuel and rearm at Scapa Flow. She continued to take part in sweeps off the Norwegian coast, occasionally coming under air attack whilst screening Fleet units or escorting troop convoys.  Sinking  On 1 May 1940, Afridi was deployed with Fleet units off Namsen Fjord pending the evacuation of the last 5,400 of the 12,000 Allied (British and French) troops in Central Norway, ending the doomed campaign to capture Trondheim. On 2 May at Namsos she embarked troops of the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and transferred them to the French auxiliary cruiser El Kantara, and in the few dark hours of 3 May embarked troops of the Hallamshire Battalion of the York and Lancaster Regiment. Afridi waited for the 36-man rearguard to reach Namsos. Some shelled transport vehicles and munitions were abandoned quayside. Afridi was the last ship to leave the port. After she joined the Shetland-bound convoy, the troopships and their escorts came under a series of air attacks. At 1000 hours the French received a direct hit through the bridge; her forward magazine exploded and she began to sink by the bow. Afridi and fellow destroyers and went to her aid and fought off two more air attacks while rescuing survivors. Imperial and Grenade left to catch up with the convoy; Afridi also left at midday after sinking the hulk of Bison by gunfire. When she rejoined the convoy at 1400, another dive bombing attack developed. Afridi was targeted by Ju 87 Stukas diving from each side, making evasive manoeuvres ineffectual. She was hit by two bombs, one passing through the wireless telegraphy office and exploding beside No. 1 Boiler Room, the second also hitting the port side just forward of the bridge and starting a severe fire at the after end of the mess decks. Imperial came alongside to port and to starboard to take aboard survivors, including Captain Philip Vian. At 1445 hours, Afridi capsized and sank bow-first. The day was the second anniversary of her commissioning. 53 of her ship's company perished including one officer. 13 soldiers were also lost‚Äîthe only casualties among the whole force of 12,000 troops evacuated from √Öndalsnes and Namsos-and 35 of the 69 Frenchmen she had picked up from Bison.

The show follows gifted high schooler Lindsay Weir, who befriends a gang of slacker \\"freaks\\", and her younger brother Sam, as he and his geek friends navigate high school. Eighteen episodes were completed, but the series was canceled after only 12 had aired. A fan campaign persuaded NBC to broadcast three of the remaining episodes in July 2000, with the rest of the unaired episodes airing that fall on Fox Family Channel. The series has appeared in numerous lists of the greatest television shows of all time, including lists by Time, Entertainment Weekly, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. It launched several of its young actors' careers, such as James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, John Francis Daley, Martin Starr, Samm Levine and Linda Cardellini. Plot Teenage Lindsay Weir and her younger brother Sam attend William McKinley High School during the 1980‚Äì1981 school year. The show is set in the town of Chippewa, Michigan, a fictional suburb of Detroit (named after Chippewa Valley High School, which series creator Paul Feig attended). Lindsay's friends constitute the title's \\"freaks\\" ‚Äî Daniel Desario, Ken Miller, Nick Andopolis, and Kim Kelly; Sam's friends constitute the \\"geeks\\" ‚Äî Neal Schweiber and Bill Haverchuck. The Weir parents, Harold and Jean, are featured in every episode. Millie Kentner, Lindsay's nerdy and highly religious former best friend, is a recurring character, as is Cindy Sanders, the popular cheerleader on whom Sam has a crush. Lindsay finds herself attempting to transform her life as an academically proficient student, star \\"mathlete\\", and young girl into a rebellious teenager who hangs out with troubled slackers. Her relationships with her new friends, and the friction they cause with her parents and with her own self-image, form one central strand of the show. The other follows Sam and his group of geeky friends as they navigate a different part of the social universe and try to fit in.

The show's producers were resistant to stunt casting. For example, they resisted the network's suggestion that they have Britney Spears appear as a waitress in one episode; they thought such appearances would detract from the show's realism. Several of the screenwriters appeared on the show. Mike White played Kim Kelly's oft- discussed injured brother, and first appeared in episode 4, \\"Kim Kelly is My Friend.\\" Paul Feig, Gabe Sachs, and series composer Michael Andrews appear uncredited as members of the fictional band Dimension in \\"I'm With the Band.\\" Numerous actors who starred on Freaks and Geeks would later appear on Judd Apatow's later TV series Undeclared, including Rogen, Segel, Levine, Starr, Phillips, and Melnick, among several others. Episodes The script for the pilot episode of Freaks and Geeks was written by Paul Feig as a spec script. Feig gave the script to producer Judd Apatow, who sold it to DreamWorks, where Apatow was under an overall deal. DreamWorks sold it to NBC, who greenlit a pilot. Before the script was shot, Feig wrote a second episode at the behest of Apatow. He showed this second script to Apatow and pilot director Jake Kasdan, and they suggested that he combine the two episodes to form a stronger pilot. Notable additions include the introduction of Kim Kelly and Lindsay's recollection of her grandmother's death. Feig wrote a final draft after a read-through with the cast, this time incorporating a first meeting between Lindsay and the freaks (in previous drafts, Lindsay was already part of the group). The show ran for 18 episodes, three of which ‚Äì \\"Kim Kelly Is My Friend\\", \\"Dead Dogs and Gym Teachers\\", and \\"Noshing and Moshing\\"‚Äì were unaired by NBC and not seen until Fox Family ran the show in 2000. The final three episodes premiered at the Museum of Television and Radio, prior to being broadcast on television. The list below is ordered by the chronology of the storyline.Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Series DVD Episode Booklet * Initial airing occurred on Fox Family. =Planned storylines= In a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair, Paul Feig detailed what would have happened to the characters in a second season: Lindsay would become a human rights lawyer, years after following the Grateful Dead. Sam would have joined the drama club. Neal would cope with his parents' divorce by joining a swing choir in school. Bill would join the basketball team, becoming a jock and leading to tension with the geeks. Daniel would end up in jail. Kim would become pregnant on tour while following the Grateful Dead. Nick would be pressured by his strict father to join the Army. Media releases =DVD and Blu-ray= On April 6, 2004, a six-DVD Freaks and Geeks box set was released through Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment. A limited \\"yearbook edition\\" set including two additional discs was also available through the official website for the show. Fans who had signed an online petition to get the show on DVD got priority in purchasing the special set. On November 25, 2008, the deluxe \\"Yearbook Edition\\" boxed set was re-released through Vivendi Entertainment. The set features all of the episodes, commentaries, and special features of the \\"Complete Series\\" six-DVD set, plus two extra discs and deluxe packaging. It is packaged as an 80-page color yearbook with essays, pictures, and episode synopses. In July 2015, Shout! Factory announced it had begun preparing for a Blu-ray release of the series. It was subsequently confirmed in December 2015, that Shout! would release the complete series on Blu-ray on March 22, 2016, and the set contains all special features from the previous releases and the episodes in both its original aspect ratio and widescreen. =Books= In October 2004, Newmarket Press released two Freaks and Geeks books: Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 1 and Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 2. Each book covers nine scripts from the series, compiled by Paul Feig and Judd Apatow. Extra content includes behind-the-scenes memos and notes; photos; additional plot lines; and excerpts from the Freaks and Geeks series bibles. =Soundtrack= Freaks and Geeks creators made it a priority to feature genuine, period-specific music that would help to create the show's tone. Clearing such names as Billy Joel, Cheap Trick, the Grateful Dead, Rush, Styx, The Moody Blues, The Who, and Van Halen required much of the show's budget. Eventually, this became an obstacle in releasing the show on DVD due to the difficulty and expense of clearing all of the music rights for the series. Music cues were changed or removed for Freaks and Geeks when it aired in reruns on Fox Family. However, Freaks and Geeks creators chose to wait to release the DVD until they could find a company willing to pay for the original music. Shout! Factory, a music and video company specializing in comprehensive reissues and compilations, eventually brought Freaks and Geeks to DVD with all of its music intact. Appearances In 2000, the cast of Freaks and Geeks was featured in an episode of the game show Family Feud hosted by Louie Anderson. Reception =Critical reception= At Metacritic, Freaks and Geeks has a score of 88 out of 100, based on 26 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a score of 100% with an average rating of 9.67 out of 10, based on 27 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Freaks and Geeks lampoons real-life adolescence while affectionately embracing every growing pain along the way with refreshing honesty.\\" =Ratings= The show averaged 6.77 million viewers and was #93 in the rankings during its only season. =Awards and nominations= The series received three Emmy Award nominations: creator Paul Feig was nominated twice for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, for \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Discos and Dragons.\\" It won for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series (Allison Jones, Coreen Mayrs and Jill Greenberg). It was nominated for two Television Critics Association Awards, for New Program of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Drama. For acting, the series won for Best Family TV Series ‚Äì Comedy and was nominated for Best Performance in a TV Series ‚Äì Young Ensemble at the Young Artist Awards. For the YoungStar Awards, John Francis Daley and Sarah Hagan were nominated for Best Young Actor/Performance in a Comedy TV Series and the ensemble was nominated for Best Young Ensemble Cast ‚Äì Television. The series also received several other nominations in other categories. The series appeared on Time magazine's 2007 \\"100 Greatest Shows of All Time\\" list, and placed third on the magazine's list of greatest television shows of the 2000s (decade). In 2004 and 2007, Freaks and Geeks ranked #25 and #21 on TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly ranked it the 13th-best series of the past 25 years. The same year, AOL TV named it the Best School Show of All Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time,Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \\"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\\". TV Guide. pp. 16-17. and ranked it #1 on their list of 60 shows that were \\"Cancelled Too Soon.\\"Roush, Matt (June 3, 2013). \\"Cancelled Too Soon\\". TV Guide. pp. 20 and 21 In 2016, it was named the 11th greatest television series of all time by Rolling Stone. Cancellation and legacy One of the cited reasons for its early cancellation was its inability to gain an audience due to its \\"erratic scheduling\\" and poor time slots, competing with the high-rated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. The producers created a website for the series, but NBC would not share its URL because \\"they didn't want people to know the Internet existed. They were worried about losing viewers to it\\" as explained by Judd Apatow. Freaks and Geeks was only averaging under 7 million viewers, while other NBC series such as Frasier and Friends were averaging over 14 million viewers each. NBC and the creative directors of Freaks and Geeks did not have the same vision for the series. After the network picked up the Freaks and Geeks pilot, Garth Ancier replaced the old NBC network's president. Ancier \\"didn't understand public school life\\" and its relevance because he went to a boarding school and then on to Princeton. Creator Paul Feig expressed the \\"irony of the situation\\" as everyone involved wanted Freaks and Geeks to be a success, but the network didn't understand the concept of realistically showcasing life as ordinary teenagers. Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow had multiple arguments with the network concerning \\"lack of victories\\" in the script and that the characters needed to \\"be cool.\\" The writers wanted to produce something that would represent the average high school experience, but the network wanted to produce something that would make high school seem cool. Because the network did not think the series would be a success, they let the writers add things to the script that they \\"wouldn't have if they thought the show would resurface the next season,\\" like the use of the phrase, \\"ambiguous genitalia.\\" Apatow said in 2014 that \\"Everything I've done, in a way, is revenge for the people who cancelled Freaks and Geeks.\\" =Undeclared= In 2001, several of the actors featured in Freaks and Geeks appeared in a new Judd Apatow college half-hour comedy Undeclared, which aired on Fox Network. Apatow fought with the network to include Freaks and Geeks actors, but the network only picked up Seth Rogen (who was already committed to the show as a writer) as a regular cast member. However, Jason Segel became a recurring character, and Samm Levine, Busy Philipps, and Natasha Melnick guest-starred in multi-episode arcs, as did prominent Freaks and Geeks guest stars Steve Bannos (who played McKinley High math teacher Mr. Frank Kowchevski) and David Krumholtz (who played Neal's older brother, Barry Schweiber). Martin Starr was prominent in another episode, and a scene with Sarah Hagan was shot, although it was cut for television broadcast. The show was also canceled during its first season. =Syndication and cast reunions= Cast of Freaks and Geeks at PaleyFest 2011 In June 2010, it was announced that IFC had acquired the rights to air both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. Freaks and Geekss 18-episode run on IFC finished with all episodes having aired as of October 29, 2010. Undeclareds IFC run began on November 5, 2010. Both shows have also joined TeenNick's line-up as of June 13, 2011. Freaks and Geeks aired on FXX, from 2013 to 2014. A reunion of several cast members and producers of both shows took place at the Paley Center for Media's PaleyFest on March 12, 2011. =Documentary= A documentary directed by Brent Hodge chronicling the history and behind-the- scenes of Freaks and Geeks featuring interviews with the cast and crew debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018.

The narrator sees his lover move away from him through the fair, after telling him that since her family will approve, \\"it will not be long, love, till our wedding day\\". She returns as a ghost at night, and repeats the words \\"it will not be long, love, till our wedding day\\", intimating her own tragic death (possibly at the hands of her disapproving family), as well as the couple's potential reunion in the afterlife. Origins of the melody The melody is in Mixolydian mode. John Loesberg speculates: \\"From its strange, almost Eastern sounding melody, it appears to be an air of some antiquity,\\" but he does not define its age any more precisely. It has been found both in Ireland and in Scotland, but scraps of the song were first collected in County Donegal by the Longford poet Padraic Colum and the musicologist Herbert Hughes. Origins and publishing of the lyrics The lyrics were first published in Hughes's Irish Country Songs, published by Boosey & Hawkes in 1909.Irish Country Songs, collected and arranged by Herbert Hughes. London and New York : Boosey & Hawkes, 1909‚Äì1915. In a letter published in The Irish Times in 1970, Colum stated that he was the author of all but the final verse. He also described how Herbert Hughes collected the tune and then he, Colum, had kept the last verse of a traditional song and written a couple of verses to fit the music.Irish Times, 22 April 1970 One verse was not included in the first publication: Colum soon realised that he had not put in the poem the fact that the woman had died before the marriage, and so he wrote the verse that begins: \\"The people were saying, that no two were e'er wed, but one had a sorrow that never was said ...\\" and sent it on to Hughes, too late for publication in that particular collection. This extra verse was published in other collections, along with the other three verses. The lyrics were also published in Colum's collection Wild Earth: And Other Poems (1916), though the traditional origin of the final verse is not mentioned there.Facsimile ‚Äì see page 26. In the course of the same Irish Times correspondence, however, another music collector, Proinsias √ì Conluain, said he had recorded a song called \\"She Went Through the Fair\\", with words the same as the other three verses of \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\", sung by an old man who told him that \\"the song was a very old one\\" and that he had learned it as a young man from a basket-weaver in Glenavy.√ì Conluain, Proinsias. \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" (letter), The Irish Times, 2 April 1970  Alternative version  The traditional singer Paddy Tunney relatesPaddy Tunney, The Stone Fiddle ‚Äì My Way to Traditional Song, Appletree Press, 1991, p. 152 how Colum wrote the song after returning from a literary gathering in Donegal with Herbert Hughes and others. Tunney suggests, however, that it would be more accurate to say that Colum simply added additional lyrics, not the melody, to an original traditional song that by then had generated many variations throughout Ireland. Tunney himself collected one version from an Irish singer called Barney McGarvey. This version was called \\"I Once Had a True Love\\". The opening four lines are reminiscent of \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" and the second four lines are unmistakably similar. The words to the first verse are: :I once had a sweet-heart, I loved her so well :I loved her far better than my tongue could tell :Her parents they slight me for my want of gear :So adieu to you Molly, since you are not here :I dreamed last night that my true love came in :So softly she came that her feet made no din :She stepped up to me and this she did say :It will not be long, love, till our wedding day The remaining two verses are quite different. Tunney also points to a version of the song that he learned from his mother, who called it \\"My Young Love Said to Me\\". The first verse is virtually the same as Colum's, but the remaining three verses are quite different: :My young love said to me, my mother won't mind :And my father won't slight you for your lack of kine :And she went away from me and this she did say: :It will not be long now till our wedding day. :She went away from me and she moved through the fair :Where hand-slapping dealers' loud shouts rent the air :The sunlight around her did sparkle and play :Saying it will not be long now till our wedding day. :When dew falls on meadow and moths fill the night :When glow of the greesagh on hearth throws half-light :I'll slip from the casement and we'll run away :And it will not be long love till our wedding day :According to promise at midnight he rose :But all that he found was the downloaded clothes :The sheets they lay empty 'twas plain for to see :And out of the window with another went she. Variants and related songs One variant of the song is called \\"Our Wedding Day\\". A related song, \\"Out of the Window\\", was collected by Sam Henry from Eddie Butcher of Magilligan in Northern Ireland in around 1930 and published in 1979.Songs of the People: Selections from the Sam Henry Collection, ed. John Moulden. Blackstaff Press, 1979. Yet another song, \\"I Once Had a True Love\\", also appears to be related, as it shares some lyrics with \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\". The 1989 song \\"Belfast Child\\" by Simple Minds incorporates the melody of \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\". In the 1990s the tune was used in the winning entry in the Com√≥rtas na nAmhr√°n Nuachumtha (\\"Competition for newly composed songs\\") in R√°th Cairn. The subject of the song, Bail√©ad an Ph√≠ol√≥ta (\\"The Ballad of the Pilot\\"), was a plane crash that took place in 1989 on an unlit runway on √Årainn Mh√≥r. Performances and recordings Scottish tenor Sydney MacEwan recorded the song in 1936 (which may be the earliest commercially released recording of the song) and Irish tenor John McCormack recorded it in 1941.http://jopiepopie.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/my-lagan-love-1904-she-moved- thro-fair.html - this page contains information on other early recordings In 1952, folklorist Peter Kennedy recorded the McPeake Family singing a version based on that of Margaret Barry entitled \\"Our Wedding Day.\\" It featured a bagpipe accompaniment by Francis McPeake, II. The traditional singer Paddy Tunney learned \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" in County Fermanagh and recorded it in 1965. Other singers who sang it in the 1950s and the 1960s included Patrick Galvin, Dominic Behan and Anne Briggs. It was popular among members of the Traveller community in Ireland at that time. Fairport Convention recorded the song in 1968, adapting the style of the song from the Traveller Margaret Barry, though she herself had learned it from the John McCormack vinyl recording. Former Fairport Convention guitarist and songwriter Richard Thompson regularly includes the song in concert performances.Richard Thompson setlist, 13 November 2015, Seattle, WA USA - http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/richard-thompson/2015/neptune-theatre-seattle- wa-bf57136.html Also of note are the recordings of the song by Alan Stivell in 1973. Art Garfunkel (formerly of Simon & Garfunkel) recorded a particularly lush version on his album Watermark (1977). Versions of the song recorded by Sin√©ad O'Connor (as used on the soundtrack of the film Michael Collins), Trees and Nana Mouskouri change the gender of the pronouns, so the song became \\"He Moved Through the Fair\\". O'Connor's and Trees' versions keep the original title even so, but Mouskouri changes it. In a 2015 interview, O'Connor expressed regret for having changed the gender. An alternative version of the lyrics is also used in Mary Black's version of the song. In June 2016, the BBC TV series The Living and the Dead premiered a version of the song sung by Elizabeth Fraser in collaboration with The Insects.

The Overstrand saw brief service in the late 1930s but by the Second World War only a few surviving aircraft remained in operation with training units. Design and development The Overstrand was a development of the Boulton Paul Sidestrand, which had first flown in 1928 and like the Sidestrand was named for a village in Norfolk, home also of Boulton Paul's Norwich factory. The Sidestrand was similar to its First World War predecessors, in that it had open cockpits and hand-operated machine-guns. Unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at making operating the guns in exposed positions difficult, particularly in the nose.Winchester 2003, p. 11.Lewis 1967, p. 238. The Overstrand was fitted with an enclosed and powered nose turret with a Lewis gun, the first RAF aircraft to have a power-operated turret. Traverse of the turret was driven by pneumatic motors, elevation and depression of the gun by hydraulic rams. The cockpit was also enclosed but the dorsal and ventral gun positions remained open, though shielded. Operational history The first Overstrand flew in 1933 as the Sidestrand Mk IV, powered by two Bristol Pegasus IM.3 engines, instead of the Bristol Jupiters in the Sidestrand and was capable of . The bomb load was also increased to . The conversion was a success and three more Sidestrands were modified using the Bristol Pegasus II.M3. 24 Overstrands were produced and in 1936 began replacing the Sidestrand in No. 101 Squadron RAF, the only Sidestrand squadron, and briefly in No. 144 Squadron RAF, being replaced by Bristol Blenheims in 1938. At the outbreak of the Second World War, eleven Overstrands remained in service and six were used for gunnery training. They remained in operation until May 1941, though flying was limited following the mid-air breakup of Overstrand K8173 on 22 April 1940.Halley 1976, p. 68.

Amphlett grew up in Geelong in Victoria, Australia. She left home as a teenager and travelled to England, France, and Spain. She was detained for three months in Spain, for singing on the streets. In May 2001, Divinyls' \\"Science Fiction\\", written by Amphlett and lead guitarist Mark McEntee, was selected by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Amphlett and McEntee barely spoke after the band separated in 1996, but resumed contact when they were inducted in 2006 into the ARIA Hall of Fame, eventually announcing a new album and tour. Amphlett died in 2013 of breast cancer and complications from multiple sclerosis. Her contribution to the arts and legacy have been honoured by having a Melbourne central city laneway named \\"Amphlett Lane\\" in her honour, complete with a commemorative plaque and two artworks. In November 2018, Amphlett was posthumously inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame. Divinyls Amphlett met Mark McEntee at a concert at the Sydney Opera House in 1980 and they formed Divinyls with Jeremy Paul (Air Supply). Having performed in Sydney for some time, they recorded several songs for the film Monkey Grip, in which Amphlett also acted. Divinyls consisted of an ever- changing line-up formed around Amphlett and McEntee, whose relationship was always volatile. Nevertheless, the band released six albums between 1982 and 1996, peaking in 1991 with the success of their single \\"I Touch Myself\\", which reached Number 1 in Australia, Number 4 in the USA, Number 10 in the UK. Divinyls did not release another album for six years, breaking up around the time of Underworld's release in Australia. Amphlett lived in New York City with her husband, concentrating on a solo career and writing her autobiography, Pleasure and Pain: My Life. Amphlett and McEntee barely spoke after the band broke up, but resumed contact when they were inducted in the 2006 ARIA Hall of Fame and eventually announced a new tour and album. They recorded and released a single, \\"Don't Wanna Do This\\", and toured Australia, but the proposed reunion album was never made. Other musical work In 1971, she performed with One Ton Gypsy. Amphlett performed Divinyls' and other songs with a 30 piece orchestra for the Australian Rock Symphony in January 2010. In 2011, she released the single \\"Summer Song\\" under the name The Tulips, a band consisting of Amphlett, Charley Drayton and Kraig Jarret Johnson. It was used in the soundtrack for the film The Music Never Stopped. Acting In 1979, Amphlett was part of the original cast of the Australian production of the Earl Wilson Jr. penned stage musical comedy Let My People Come, playing the role of Linda Lips. The adult-themed musical opened at the Total Theatre in Melbourne, running for nine months, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in Sydney for an additional three months. Amphlett made her film debut in Monkey Grip (1982) in a supporting role as Angela, the temperamental lead singer of a rock band. In 1988, she starred opposite Russell Crowe in the first Australian production of Willy Russell's stage musical Blood Brothers. Amphlett played Judy Garland in the original touring production of The Boy from Oz, with Todd McKenney playing the role of Peter Allen. When the highly successful show transferred to Broadway in the year 2000, Garland was played by American performer Isabel Keating and Allen by Hugh Jackman. On its return to Australia as an arena spectacular, Amphlett resumed playing the role. Personal life Amphlett grew up in Geelong and attended Belmont High School. She was a cousin of Australian singer Little Pattie (Patricia Amphlett). Amphlett worked as a child model from the age of 3 until 12, and later said, \\"I didn't come from a very wealthy family so that actually clothed me and allowed me to have things\\". According to her autobiography, her father was a World War II veteran and the son of a German immigrant and Melbourne chef while her mother was from a well off Hawthorn family. Amphlett and her bandmate Mark McEntee were romantically involved from 1982 to 1993. They met in 1980, and began a relationship two years later when McEntee split up with his wife. Their relationship was highly volatile, being marred by drug and alcohol use, and physical fights. However the band's manager, Vince Lovegrove, later stated that the nature of their \\"weird\\" relationship was the \\"magic of Divinyls\\". On 27 July 1999, Amphlett married American drummer Charley Drayton,\\"Amphlett (Chrissy) Christina\\", Who's Who in Australia, Crown Content, 2010. who played drums on the Divinyls' eponymous album and was the drummer in the reformed group. In an interview on the Nine Network program A Current Affair, on 7 December 2007, Amphlett revealed that she had multiple sclerosis. On 20 October 2010, she announced that she had breast cancer and was being treated in New York where she lived with her husband. She also said that her sister was a breast cancer survivor. On 24 January 2011, she claimed to be free of cancer. Death Amphlett died, aged 53, on 21 April 2013 at her home in Manhattan, after a long battle with breast cancer. Due to the multiple sclerosis that Amphlett concurrently had, she reported that she was unable to receive radiation treatment or chemotherapy as cancer treatment. Following the announcement of Amphlett's death, numerous tributes were received from artists, performers and musicians. Russell Crowe wrote: \\"RIP Chrissie Amphlett, [she] played my mum in Blood Brothers, 1988.\\" I Touch Myself Project Chrissy‚Äôs family and friends and Cancer Council NSW launched the breast cancer awareness project \\"I Touch Myself\\" in 2014, as a tribute to her. The video features 10 leading female Australian artists (Olivia Newton John, Megan Washington, Sarah McLeod, Katie Noonan, Sarah Blasko, Suze DeMarchi, Deborah Conway, Kate Ceberano, Little Pattie and Connie Mitchell) singing Amphlett's song. Cancer Council NSW summarized the message of the campaign as \\"However, detecting breast cancer early is the most important factor in beating this disease. Through this campaign we are encouraging women to get to know their breasts better, to know what is normal for them and to participate in breast screening if they‚Äôre in the right age range.\\"  See also  * Tony Mott References External links * 1959 births 2013 deaths 20th-century Australian actresses 20th-century Australian singers 21st-century Australian singers APRA Award winners Australian buskers Australian expatriates in the United States Australian female singer-songwriters Australian musical theatre actresses Australian new wave musicians Australian rock singers Australian people of German descent Actresses of German descent Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Deaths from breast cancer Deaths from multiple sclerosis Divinyls members Female new wave singers Musicians from Victoria (Australia) People from Geelong 20th-century Australian women singers 21st-century Australian women singers ","title":"Chrissy Amphlett"},{"id":"965110","text":"Mark William Neumann (born February 27, 1954) is an American businessman and politician.

Intended for service in Asia, Albion and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the Majestics. Albion was laid down in December 1896, launched in June 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in June 1901. Albion spent the first few years of her career abroad on the China Station from 1901 to 1905, before returning to British waters to serve with the Channel Fleet and later the Atlantic Fleet. After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised and returned to the Channel Fleet, but was quickly sent to the Atlantic to help defend against the possibility of German warships breaking out of the North Sea. In December and January 1915, she supported operations against German Southwest Africa. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea in January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits.

The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. Albion was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to full loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.Gardiner, p. 35 The Canopus-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time‚Äî from ‚Äîa full two knots faster than the Majestics.Gardiner, pp. 34, 35 Albion had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. To save weight, Albion carried less armour than the Majestics‚Äî in the belt compared to ‚Äîalthough the change from Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in Albion meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

Albions completion then was delayed by late delivery of her machinery. She finally began trials late in 1900, during which she was further delayed by machinery and gun defects, and she was not finally completed until June 1901.Burt, pp. 141, 159 HMS Albion was commissioned on 25 June 1901 at Chatham Dockyard, by Captain W. W. Hewett and a complement of 779 officers and men, to relieve battleship Barfleur on the China Station. She arrived at Hong Kong on 11 September 1901, and relieved Barfleur as second flagship of the China Station, based in that city. Captain Martyn Jerram was appointed flag captain in March 1902. During her time on the station, she underwent refits at Hong Kong in 1902 and 1905. In 1905, the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance, reducing the requirement for a large British presence on the China Station, and the Royal Navy recalled all its battleships from the station. At Singapore, Albion rendezvoused with her sister ships Ocean and Vengeance and battleship Centurion, and on 20 June 1905 the four battleships departed to steam in company to Plymouth, where they arrived on 2 August 1905.Burt, pp. 97, 159 Albion then became part of the Channel Fleet. She soon suffered a mishap, colliding with battleship Duncan at Lerwick on 26 September 1905, but suffered no damage. Albion transferred to the commissioned Reserve on 3 April 1906, and underwent an engine and boiler refit at Chatham.Gardiner & Gray, p. 7 On 25 February 1907, Albion paid off at Portsmouth. On 26 February 1907, Albion recommissioned at Portsmouth for temporary service with the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet. She returned to full commission on 26 March 1907 to begin service in the Atlantic Fleet. During this service, she underwent a refit at Gibraltar in 1908 and at Malta in 1909. She was with the fleet that visited London from 17 July to 24 July 1909 to be entertained by the citizens of the city, and on 31 July 1909 was present at the fleet review of the Home and Atlantic Fleets at Cowes by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.Burt, p. 153 Albion ended her Atlantic Fleet service by paying off on 25 August 1909. She then began service at the Nore as parent ship of the 4th Division, Home Fleet. She became a unit of the 3rd Fleet at the Nore in May 1912, and underwent a refit at Chatham that year. She was stationed at Pembroke Dock in 1913. =World War I= When World War I broke out in August 1914, Albion was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet.Corbett (1920), p. 77 On 15 August 1914, she became second flagship of the new 7th Battle Squadron. On 21 August 1914, she was sent to the Saint Vincent-Finisterre Station to provide battleship support to cruiser squadrons operating in the Atlantic in case Imperial German Navy heavy ships broke out into the open Atlantic. Here, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral H. L. Tottenham.Corbett (1920), p. 84 On 3 September 1914, she transferred her flag, becoming a private ship, and moved to the Cape Verde-Canary Islands station to relieve her sister ship there. Albion was transferred to the Cape of Good Hope Station in South Africa in October 1914, where she took up duty as a guard ship at Walvis Bay through November 1914. Following the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, where a British cruiser squadron was defeated by the German East Asia Squadron, the Admiralty ordered Rear Admiral Herbert King-Hall, the commander of the Cape of Good Hope Station, to concentrate his squadron to prevent Spee from defeating him in detail. Albion was accordingly recalled from Walvis Bay to Table Bay.Corbett (1920), pp. 423‚Äì424 In December 1914 and January 1915, she participated in Allied operations against German Southwest Africa.Burt, pp. 159‚Äì160 Later in January, Albion returned to port in Simon's Town, South Africa, before proceeding to the Mediterranean Sea.Corbett (1921), p. 235 Dardanelles campaign Map showing the Ottoman defences at the Dardanelles in 1915 Albion transferred to the Mediterranean in January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles campaign. She took part in the bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the outer entrance to the Dardanelles on 19 February 1915. This was the first stage in a plan to force the Dardanelles and enter the Sea of Marmara. Albion was joined by three other British battlecruisers and battleships‚Äî, , and ‚Äîand two French battleships‚Äî and . Once these ships had cleared the initial defences, additional ships would join the attack; heavy Ottoman resistance instead stalled the initial attack before Albion could begin her part of the operation, and she did not see action that day. Nevertheless, she did sweep an area for naval mines along with the protected cruiser ; while on the operation, Albion fired eight 6-inch shells in an unsuccessful attempt to draw Ottoman attention so their guns could be destroyed by counter-battery fire.Corbett (1921), pp. 142‚Äì149 Albion participated in another attack on the forts on 25 February; she was tasked with covering a group of minesweepers, along with Triumph and several destroyers after the main bombardment force suppressed the Ottoman batteries. During their operation, Albion came under fire from a gun from Battery \\"Orkaniye\\"; counter fire from Albion, and forced the Ottomans to check their fire. By the afternoon, most of the Ottoman artillery had ceased firing, apart from some field guns that could not be observed, and so the minesweepers were ordered to begin clearing the mines, covered by Albion, Triumph, and Vengeance. The following day, Albion, Triumph, and were assigned to the force that was to break into the Dardanelles and destroy the fortresses at close range. Albion was assigned to the fort at Dardanus, and she opened fire with her main battery at a range of , though the Ottoman response was light. After the guns fell silent, Albion and Majestic moved on but quickly came under fire from dispersed, mobile field guns, and both vessels were forced to take evasive maneuvers to avoid serious damage. After Majestic was holed below the waterline, Admiral John de Robeck ordered them to break off the attack.Corbett (1921), pp. 157‚Äì168 On 28 February, Albion took part in another attempt to suppress the Ottoman defences in the Dardanelles; she and Triumph led the operation, and were tasked with neutralizing the repaired fortress at Dardanus, while Majestic and Ocean supported them by engaging the mobile field guns. As Albion and Triumph approached Dardanus, they came under heavy fire from Ottoman guns on the European side of the straits, including the fortress at Erenk√∂y, and were forced to circle to avoid taking hits. Unable to engage Dardanus under these conditions, the ships instead opened fire on the guns at Erenk√∂y, which initially seemed to be effective, as the Ottoman fire slackened. Ocean and Majestic approached in an attempt to attack Dardanus, but they too came under renewed, furious fire from Erenk√∂y, and de Robeck again ordered a withdrawal. The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from Triumph went ashore and disabled a number of light guns. The inability of the British and French fleets to neutralize the mobile field guns convinced the Allied command that the only way forward would be to make a major amphibious assault to clear the guns by land.Corbett (1921), pp. 166‚Äì169 left Albion supported another operation in the Dardanelles on 3 March; she, Triumph and covered a landing force that was to raid Sedd el Bahr. Heavy weather delayed the start of the attack, but the landing took place without incident. Albion shelled Erenk√∂y, which did not return fire, and the landing party discovered a battery of six 15-pounder field guns that they destroyed.Corbett (1921), pp. 172‚Äì173 Two days later, Albion conducted an indirect fire test to determine the efficacy of attempting to neutralize the fortresses at ranges where the Ottomans would be unable to reply; this was planned to demonstrate the feasibility of using the powerful dreadnought , armed with guns, in that role. Albion was tasked with shelling one of the fortresses protecting √áanakkale, and she was covered by several British and French battleships. On entering the straits, Albion came under heavy fire, particularly from Dardanus; three of the covering battleships joined her to suppress those guns, briefly allowing Albion to anchor and begin the planned bombardment. Queen Elizabeth joined the bombardment, but mobile howitzers quickly found both vessels and forced de Robeck to break off the operation.Corbett (1921), pp. 189‚Äì190 On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet mounted a major attack on the Ottoman defences; Albion joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and suppress the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans they were going to land troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship and then Inflexible began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage,Corbett (1921), pp. 213‚Äì218 and the battleship Bouvet struck a mine and exploded.Gardiner, p. 294 Albion and several other battleships attempted to suppress Ottoman guns firing on the boats that went to rescue Bouvets crew.Corbett (1921), p. 219 She supported the main landings at V Beach at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915. Starting at around 04:30 on the morning of the landings, Albion bombarded the high ground overlooking the beach, but by around 05:30, heavy smoke and mist prevented her gunners from observing targets and so she ceased fire. After the Allied forces began to go ashore, Albion supported their advance on the village of Sedd el Bahr, but by around 07:30 had to check fire again, as friendly troops had entered the town. She then shifted fire to support the men going ashore at W Beach, but heavy Ottoman fire repulsed the landing and the Allied soldiers were forced to withdraw.Corbett (1921), pp. 330‚Äì332, 334‚Äì334 As it turned out, the report of Allied troops in Sedd el Bahr proved to be erroneous, and further attacks were launched against the Ottoman defenders the following day, which Albion supported. After Albion knocked out a machine gun position on the south-west corner of the village, the troops were able to advance into the town and force the Ottomans to retreat.Corbett (1921), pp. 354‚Äì455 On 28 April 1915 she took part in an attack on Krithia, led by five French battleships and supported by four other British battleships.Corbett (1921), p. 362 Albion suffered significant damage from Ottoman shore batteries, forcing her to retire to Mudros for repairs, leaking badly. The repair work took three days to complete.Corbett (1921), p. 368 Back in action on 2 May 1915, she again was hit by shells from Ottoman batteries on the Asian side of the straits, necessitating further repairs at Mudros.Burt, p. 160Corbett (1921), p. 377 On the night of 22‚Äì23 May 1915, Albion beached on a sandbank off Gaba Tepe and came under heavy fire from Ottoman shore batteries. About 200 fragmentation shells hit her, but they could not penetrate her armour and did no serious damage, and Albion suffered fewer than a dozen casualties. After efforts were made to free her by reducing her weight and by using the recoil of firing her main guns simultaneously, her sister ship Canopus towed her to safety on 24 May 1915, Albion still firing at the Ottoman forts while being towed clear. Albion left the area for repairs on 26 May 1915 and underwent a refit at Malta in May‚ÄìJune 1915. Later operations In late September, after Bulgaria entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, Britain and France negotiated with Greece to allow an expeditionary force to debark at Salonika to attack Bulgaria. On 4 October 1915, Albion arrived at Salonika to become a unit of the 3rd Detached Squadron, tasked with assisting the French Navy in a blockade of the coasts of Greece and Bulgaria and with reinforcing the Suez Canal Patrol. She embarked the first British Army contingent of 1,500 troops for Salonika and escorted French troopships carrying the French second contingent.Corbett (1923), pp. 160‚Äì165 Albion served on the Salonika Station until April 1916, then became a guard ship at Queenstown, Ireland, later that month. In May 1916 she moved to Devonport for a refit; that completed, she moved on to the Humber in August 1916 for service as a guard ship there. In October 1918, Albions service as a guard ship came to an end, and she was reduced to service as an accommodation ship. In August 1919, Albion was placed on the disposal list at Devonport. She was sold for scrapping on 11 December 1919. She left Devonport under her own steam on 3 January 1920, arriving at Morecambe for scrapping on 6 January 1920.

She was rebuilt once during her career, and served in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. Orders were issued on 9 January 1738 for Antelope to be taken to pieces and rebuilt according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment at Woolwich, from where she was relaunched on 27 January 1741. Career On 16 June 1756, she sailed from England for Gibraltar with Vice Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke and Rear Admiral Charles Saunders. She arrived there on 3 July with an order to supersede Admiral John Byng. Antelope returned to England with Byng, sailing on 9 July and arriving at Spithead on 26 July, where Byng was arrested before being landed on 19 August. His trial started on board St George on 27 December. On 30 April 1757, Captain Samuel Hood took command of Antelope. On 15 May, after a short action off Brest, France, the French Aquilon, 50, was driven on to the rocks in Audierne Bay where she was wrecked. Then, on 31 October 1758, in the Kingroad off Portishead, Antelope took , 64, one of a French squadron returning from Quebec, that had anchored off Ilfracombe, Antelope opened fire but the French ship surrendered without having fired a shot in return. Not every action was a success. In 1759, under the command of Captain James Webb, Antelope was attached to Commodore William Boys' squadron, which had been blockading Fran√ßois Thurot in Dunkirk throughout the summer and early autumn. On 15 October, when the squadron had been driven off station during a gale, Thurot made his escape with six frigates and corvettes carrying 1300 troops and sailed to Gothenburg. In 1762, Antelope was stationed in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, under the command of Commodore Thomas Graves, who was the Colony's Naval Governor. A French fleet from Brest, under M. de Ternay, with 1500 troops commanded by the Comte d'Haussonville, sailed into St. John's and captured the town on 24 June. Captain Graves immediately sent word to Commodore Lord Colville at Halifax who joined him in blockading the French, and brought troops over from Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island on 11 September. During a gale on 16 September de Ternay evaded the blockade and, abandoning the troops, sailed back to France. On her way home to England Antelope encountered Marlborough, under Captain Thomas Burnett, which had sailed from Havana as part of the escort of a convoy of prizes and transports, but had become separated in very heavy weather. She was leaking so badly that her guns had to be thrown overboard and the pumps kept working. Antelope took all her people off on 29 November when she started to founder and she was allowed to sink. Later, in 1780, Antelope was again patrolling the Labrador coast and intercepted the American ship Mercury. As the vessels came to close quarters, a package was thrown overboard from the latter. One of the sailors on Antelope dived from the deck and rescued the package, which contained details of secret negotiations then being conducted between the United States and the United Provinces. Antelope Harbour, Labrador, is named for this incident. Antelope was sold out of the service on 30 October 1783.

It is governed by a municipality corporation. Located there are the administrative headquarters of the Morena district and of the Chambal division. It is 39 km from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Morena was once known for being terrorized by a large number of dacoits years ago. Bhind is a separate city that neighbors Morena. Morena is known as an industrial hub but the economy relies majorly on agriculture. Many manufacturing industries are situated in the industrial areas of Morena and Morena District.  Geography  Morena is located at . It has an average elevation of 177 metres (580 feet). It is connected by rail and national highway with Gwalior and Agra. Oilseed milling and cotton weaving are among the chief industries. The city has three colleges affiliated with Jiwaji University and two colleges affiliated with RGPV University. The surrounding region was formerly occupied by the princely states of Sheopur, Sabalgarh, Gauraiya Basai, Gurjar Ghar and Esha. The lower Chambal River basin consists of an alluvial tract in the north, cut by numerous ravines, and a forested area toward the south. Wheat and oilseeds are the main crops, and building stone is quarried. Morena is known for its peacocks (150,959 in 2001). In ancient times, the area was called Mayur Van as it had a large amount of peacocks. Demographics census, Morena had a population of 288,303. 13.2% of the population is under six years old.

Places of interest National Chambal Sanctuary, also called the National Chambal Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary, is a tri-state protected area in northern India for the critically endangered gharial (small crocodiles), the red-crowned roof turtle, and the endangered Ganges River dolphin. Located on the Chambal River near the tripoint of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the sanctuary was first declared in Madhya Pradesh in 1978 and now constitutes a long narrow eco-reserve co-administered by the three states. Within the sanctuary the pristine Chambal River cuts through mazes of ravines and hills with many sandy beaches. The Pahargarh cave paintings are more than 30,000 years old on rocks of the Ashan River. They are 15 km from Fort Pahargarh. The Pahargarh was a zamindari seat of the Sikarwar Rajput clan under King Gurjar of Gauraiya Basai state. Sas-Bahu Abhilekh reflects that Suhoniya, known as Sihoniya today, was the capital of the Kushwahas. The Kachwaha kingdom was established in the 11th century between 1015 and 1035 A.D. The Kachwaha king, Kirtiraj, had a Shiv temple erected at Sihoniya. This temple is known as the \\"Kakanmath\\" and was built without using any adhesive materials. It stands on a spot away from Sihoniya in northwestern Morena district. It is said that Kakan Math was built by King Kirtiraj to fulfill the will of Queen Kakanwati. It is high and is built in the Kajurho style. Sihoniya is a holy place for practitioners of Jainism. In the east of the village are ruins from Jain temples dating from the 11th century A.D. In these temples there are statues of the Tirthankars such as Shantinath, Kunthnath, Arahanath, Adinath, Parshvnath and others. The main temple has three statues: Shantinath, Kunthnath, and Arhanath, each in height. Kuntalpur, known as Kutwar, is the largest ancient village in the Chambal valley. It is just like Hastinapur, Rajgraha and Chadi of the Mahabharat period. The ancient Amba or Harrisiddhi Devi temple and a crescent-shaped dam erected on the river Asan are tourist spots in Kutwar. The Kotwal Reservoir is also a place for migratory birdwatching. There is also boating and fishing in this river. There is also an ancient village that is considered a Mahabharata-era village. One legend states that a character of Mahabharata Karna‚Äôs birthplace is in this village. Many ruins present there that look like a castle and many muddy pots, coins, utensils can be found. =Padawali= Bateshwar temple complex in Padawali The Gurjara-Pratiharas built several temples, scattered across the Padawali area, known as Bateshwar temples. Around Padawali there are the ruins of several temples, houses and colonies. This new area of population is known as Padawali because it is surrounded by several hills. Here was a magnificent ancient Vishnu temple which was later converted into a large 'Garhi'. The terrace, the courtyard and the assembly hall of this temple are the epitome of ancient culture. The standing statue of a lion on the ruined gate seems to say that there was a time when he used to watch the temple with his companion at its gate. More than fifty monuments of different kinds can be seen at Padawali up to the valley of Bhuteshwar. =Mitawali= In the north of Naresar, there is a 64-yogini temple situated on a hundred foot high mountain. It is a circular construction of radius in the style of Delhi's Parliament House. Attached to the circular verandah are 64 rooms and a large courtyard in the temple. In the centre of the temple there is the circular temple of Lord Shiva and Lord Anuranjan. It was built by Gurjar Pratihar kings. Sabalgarh Fort Amongst the monuments of the medieval age, the fort of Sabalgarh is worth visiting. A 'Bandh' was built behind the fort in the Scindia period. The foundation of Sabalgarh was laid by a 'Gujar' named Sabla in the past. Construction of the fort on a somewhat high cliff was made by Gopal Singh, the Raja of Karoli. Sikandar Lodhi sent an army to hold control over this strongly built fort. The Marathas, in their campaign of northern India, again won it and gave it back to the king of Karoli. But in the year 1795 it was again taken from him by Khande Rao, whose house still stands here. Lord Vallejali Daulat Rao Scindia (1764‚Äì1837) lived in the Fort of Gwalior during his regime. It was seized by the English in the year 1804‚Äì5. In 1809 the area around this fort was added to the kingdom of Scindia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDGVvXrLWUw&t;=523s  Local cuisine  Gajak is a well-known sweet originating in Morena. It is made of sesame and jaggery specially manufactured during the winter. Another notable dessert or sweet from the Morena (Tanwarghar) region is malpuaa, which is made with jaggery and flour. ;Bedai-Sabji or Dahi-Jalebi This special breakfast, usually served at street stands, consists of two parts: one spicy and one sweet. The bedai (sometimes spelled berahi) is a fried, puffy bread, much like kachori, served with a bowl of spicy green sabzi dotted with hunks of potato and a dollop of curd. The jalebi, which is often served in Delhi, is a sticky-sweet dessert made of fermented batter that's fried into ropy whorls, then soaked in hot sugary syrup. Freshly made and consumed one after another on a crowded street corner, together they make up the definitive balanced breakfast of Morena.

The French captured her in 1781, 1782, and finally, in 1794. She is most famous for a desperate single-ship action in 1793 when her crew captured a better-armed French privateer with a much larger crew. Career The French first captured her in 1781, and then ransomed her. They then captured her again on 10 October 1782. They took her into Nantes, from where Captain William Kempthorne re- purchased her on 4 April 1783, and took her under command.\\"Actions, Damage & Losses.\\"Falmouth Packet Archives 1688-1850. On 1 December 1793, Antelope was sailing without Captain Kempthorne, who had remained in Falmouth due to illness, and was off Cumberland Harbour, Cuba when she sighted two privateers. Obeying orders, Antelope headed back to port to avoid trouble, but the next day the wind failed and one of the privateers, Atlante (of eight 3-pounder guns), was able to come alongside and attack. Antelope was armed with six 3-pounder (1.4 kg) guns and manned by a crew of 21. Atlante, a French privateer from Charleston, South Carolina, had a crew of 65, consisting of Frenchmen, Irishmen, and Americans. During the battle, both of Antelopes officers were killed or wounded. Before he fell, the master, Mr. Edward Curtis, turned the two bow guns, double shotted, to cover the bow, and fired them at the first boarding party, killing and wounding some 15 men; he fell shortly thereafter.Anon. (1895), pp.44-52. Command fell on Boatswain John Pascoe, who then led the crew in repelling the boarding parties. Antelopes crew repeatedly threw back the privateers, and eventually cut their grapples. In their resistance, Antelopes crew was aided by the fact that she was higher than the Atlante, enabling the crew to fire down on the deck of the privateer while being protected. Not content with having repelled the attacks, Pascoe raced up the rigging, lashing the squaresail yard of Atlante to Antelopes foreshrouds, and continued the battle until Atlante surrendered. Antelope lost 3 killed and 3 wounded, one mortally. The privateer lost her first captain mortally wounded and second captain wounded, 30 men killed in the action, and 17 wounded (three mortally); only 16 of her 65 men were unhurt. The victorious Antelope put into Annotto Bay, Jamaica with her prize. It turned out that Atlante had been out of Charlestown a month, during which time she had taken one prize, a Bermudian brig. Jamaica's House of Assembly voted a sum of 500 guineas to the officers and men of Antelope. Two hundred guineas went to the widow of Mr. Curtis, the late master. One hundred guineas each went to the first mate, who had been shot through the body during the engagement, and to Mr. Pascoe, the boatswain. The last hundred guineas was divided among the surviving members of the crew. In London, the Committee for Encouraging the Capture of French Privateers too passed out lavish rewards.Robinson (1964), p.71. Pascoe received 50 guineas and a gold whistle; the crew, widows, and dependents received money. The Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, the Earl of Chesterfield too presented prizes but \\"stressed that this was an award made solely due to the lengthy defence and successful protection of the mail. He did not want to encourage crews to actively seek prize money or ships. Their duty was to the safe and swift delivery of the post.\\" Fate On 19 August 1794, Antelope sailed for North America with thirty men. On 19 September 1794, she encountered a squadron of French frigates in a dense fog. Her crew sank the mail and surrendered to Surveillante. While a captive of the French, Captain Kempthorne died of yellow fever. Antelopes assessed value when lost was ¬£2750 16s 8d (plus ¬£34 for her ordnance stores).

There, and during travels around the globe, he performed research on the axenic culture of nematodes, nematode parasites of insects and the fossil records of insects and nematodes in amber. In 1992 a team consisting of Poinar, his wife entomologist Roberta Poinar, his son Hendrik, and Dr. Ra√∫l J. Cano of California Polytechnic State University successfully extracted insect DNA from a Lebanese weevil in amber that was 125 million years old, collected by Raif Milki in Lebanon. More recent studies of ancient DNA cast doubt on the DNA results, but not on the authenticity of the amber samples. In 1995, George and Roberta Poinar, a fellow researcher from Berkeley, moved to Oregon, where they opened the Amber Institute. Upon his move to Oregon he received a courtesy appointment to the Department of Entomology of Oregon State University. In 2016, Poinar announced the discovery of a new plant species that‚Äôs a 45-million-year-old relative of coffee he found in amber. Named Strychnos electri, after the Greek word for amber (electron), the flowers represent the first-ever fossils of an asterid. In 2017, Poinar published a paper describing a fossilized flower and its tentative pollinator.Ancient Termite Pollinator of Milkweed Flowers in Dominican Amber Poinar GO Jr. American Entomologist 2017 63:52-59 The paper describes a flower of an ancestral milkweed plant, which was named Discoflorus neotropicus, and a termite carrying a pollinium, all covered in Dominican amber. Poinar's son, Hendrik Poinar, is a genetics researcher in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster University.

Antelope served throughout the Second World War, taking part in the sinking of three enemy submarines and in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa.  Construction and design  Antelope was ordered on 6 March 1928,English 1993, p. 15. and was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie on Tyneside on 11 July 1928. The ship was launched on 27 July 1929 and commissioned on 20 March 1930.Whitley 2000, p. 97. She had a main gun armament of four guns on low angle (30 degree) mounts that were only suitable for anti- ship use, and an anti-aircraft armament of two 2-pounder (40 mm) \\"pom-poms\\". Eight torpedo tubes were fitted on two quadruple mounts, with Mark V torpedoes carried. The initial anti-submarine equipment was limited, with no sonar carried and only six depth charges.Whitley 2000, p. 98.Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, pp. 37‚Äì38. In 1941, one of the 4.7 in guns and the aft bank of torpedo tubes was removed, with a anti-aircraft gun replacing the torpedo tubes and an enhanced anti-submarine armament, which included 70 depth charges and the ability to drop patterns of 10 charges. Radar was also fitted, and the destroyer's close-in anti-aircraft outfit was supplemented by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, of which two were fitted in 1941 followed by four more later on. The 3 inch gun was removed by 1943, when high-frequency direction finding gear was fitted. A second 4.7 in gun was replaced in 1944 by two QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns.  History  = Prewar operations = Following completion in 1930, Antelope, along with the rest of the A class and the destroyer leader joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Sea. Antelope took part in patrols off the Spanish coast during the Spanish Civil War, but was damaged in a collision with the destroyers and . After repair Antelope returned to the United Kingdom, where she was based at Portsmouth.English 1993, p. 21. = Second World War = On the outbreak of the Second World War, the destroyer was assigned to the 18th Destroyer Flotilla, Channel Force, based at Portsmouth. For the rest of 1939 and the early months of 1940, Antelope carried out patrol and convoy escort duties in the English Channel and Western Approaches. On 5 February 1940, Antelope was the sole escort of the outward bound convoy OA 84 south of Ireland when the German submarine attacked the convoy, sinking the freighter Beaverburn and damaging the tanker Ceronia. Antelope retaliated, depth-charging and sinking the U-boat.Blair 2000, p 138. It was the only U-boat at sea at the time in the area and was the first to be sunk underwater by a single destroyer. Antelopes commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Richard Taylor White R.N. (later Captain R.T. White D.S.O., 2nd son of Sir Archibald White, Bt. of Wallingwells) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) on 11 July 1940 for good services to the Royal Navy since the outbreak of the war.The Edinburgh Gazette, 16 July 1940, p. 443 White was commander of Antelope from 24 September 1938 until 26 February 1941. = Norway = In April 1940, Antelope was attached to the Home Fleet for operations as part of the Norwegian Campaign, and when the , flagship of the French forces off Norway,Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 15. was damaged by German bombers off Namsos, Antelope escorted the French cruiser to Scapa Flow.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 19. Antelope then returned to operations off Norway, but on 13 June 1940, Antelope collided with the destroyer off Trondheim, Norway, and had to return to the Tyne for repair which continued until August that year, when she joined the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich. = Atlantic operations = In August 1940, Antelope sailed in convoy to take part in Operation Menace, the attack on Dakar, but after the cruiser was torpedoed on 1 September 1940, she escorted her back to the Clyde, Scotland. Antelope then joined the 12th Destroyer Flotilla based at Greenock, Scotland. On 31 October 1940, Antelope was part of the escort convoy OB 237 when it encountered off northwestern Ireland. Depth charges from Antelope and drove U-31 to the surface, where her crew abandoned ship. Antelope attempted to board U-31, but collided with the unmanned submarine, damaging the destroyer and sinking U-31. Antelope rescued 44 of the U-31s crew, one of whom died on board, and returned them to the Clyde.Blair 2000, pp. 203‚Äì204. Lt. Cdr. White was awarded his first bar to his D.S.O. following this sinking.Supplement to the London Gazette, 14 January 1941, p. 262 Antelope joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, with the job of escorting the capital ships of the Home Fleet. In May 1941, Antelope formed part of the destroyer escort for the battlecruiser and battleship in the chase for the . Separated from the battleships during the battle of the Denmark Strait, Antelope searched for survivors from the sinking of Hood, and later was escort to the aircraft carrier . In August 1941, Antelope took part in Operation Gauntlet, an operation that succeeded in destroying the coaling facilities on Spitsbergen, thus denying the coal to Germans. In October, Antelope formed part of the escort for the Arctic Convoy PQ 1 to the Soviet Union. = Malta = Antelope sailed to Gibraltar in April 1942, escorting the US aircraft carrier during Operation Calendar, an attempt to deliver badly needed Spitfire fighter aircraft to Malta. She acted as an escort during the follow-up Operation Bowery, when carriers and USS Wasp delivered 61 Spitfires and Operation LB when Eagle delivered a further 17 during May, and Operations Style and Salient in June 1942, when Eagle delivered 55 more Spitfires.Barnett 2000, pp. 504‚Äì505. On 11 June, only a day after returning to Gibraltar following Operation Salient, Antelope formed part of the escort for Operation Harpoon, a heavily escorted attempt to resupply Malta. After the cruiser was damaged by Italian torpedo bombers, Antelope was dispatched from the convoy to tow Liverpool back to Gibraltar, with the destroyer as escort.Barnett 2000, pp. 505‚Äì506. In July, Antelope took part in two further Spitfire resupply runs with Eagle, Operations Pinpoint and Insect. In August 1942 Antelope formed part of the main escort force for Operation Pedestal, another Malta convoy. After a period based off West Africa, Antelope escorted troop convoys taking part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French West Africa.English 1993, p. 22. On 30 January 1943, Antelope, together with the Canadian corvette , sank the . On 13 March 1943, she was escorting the ocean liner , when the liner was sunk by the Italian submarine .Piggott 2010, p. 155. In July 1943, Antelope took part in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily.  Disposal  In August 1944, Antelope returned to the United Kingdom. By this time she was in poor physical condition, and was paid off into reserve on the Tyne in October to free her crew to help ease a manpower shortage in the Royal Navy. In 1946, she was sold and broken up by Hughes Bolckow shipbreakers.

Ordered by the Australian government in 1909, she was launched in 1911, and commissioned as flagship of the fledgling Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in 1913. Australia was the only capital ship ever to serve in the RAN. At the start of World War I, Australia was tasked with finding and destroying the German East Asia Squadron, which was prompted to withdraw from the Pacific by the battlecruiser's presence. Repeated diversions to support the capture of German colonies in New Guinea and Samoa, as well as an overcautious Admiralty, prevented the battlecruiser from engaging the German squadron before the latter's destruction. Australia was then assigned to North Sea operations, which consisted primarily of patrols and exercises, until the end of the war. During this time, Australia was involved in early attempts at naval aviation, and 11 of her personnel participated in the Zeebrugge Raid. The battlecruiser was not at the Battle of Jutland, as she was undergoing repairs following a collision with sister ship . Australia only ever fired in anger twice: at a German merchant vessel in January 1915, and at a suspected submarine contact in December 1917. On her return to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship mutinied after a request for an extra day's leave in Fremantle was denied, although other issues played a part in the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, and the perception that Royal Navy personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw Australias role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of Australia as part of the British Empire's commitment, and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924. Design The Indefatigable class of battlecruisers were based heavily on the preceding . The main difference was that the Indefatigables design was enlarged to give the ships' two-wing turrets a wider arc of fire. As a result, the Indefatigable class was not a significant improvement on the Invincible design; the ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While Von der Tanns characteristics were not known when the lead ship of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on Australia and her sister ship .Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 28‚Äì29 Charles Edward Dixon Australia had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draught of .Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 16‚Äì17 The ship displaced at load and at deep load.Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 43‚Äì44 She had a crew of 818 officers and ratings in 1913.Burt, British Battleships of World War One, p. 91 The ship was powered by two Parsons' sets of direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning Babcock & Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during trials in 1913, Australia turbines provided , allowing her to reach .Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 76, 80 Australia carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of . Australia carried eight BL Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; the largest guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure.Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 81‚Äì84 She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, one on each side aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.Campbell, Battle Cruisers, p. 14 The Indefatigables were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered the end barbettes. Their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The main battery turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.Roberts, Battlecruisers, p. 112 Australias 'A' turret was fitted with a rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament, in case normal fire control positions were knocked out or rendered inoperable.Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 90‚Äì91 =Modifications= Australia received a single QF 20 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added in March 1915.

The 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, and two aft guns were removed at the same time.Campbell, Battle Cruisers, p. 13 An additional 4-inch gun was fitted during 1917 as an AA gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60¬∞. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only ;British 4\\"/50 (10.2 cm) BL Mark VII, Navweapons.com 100 rounds were carried for it. Australias forward turret ('A') in 1918; note the port (i.e. left- side) wing turret in the background with a biplane on its roof Australia received a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently.Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 92‚Äì93 Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland. By 1918, Australia carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter on platforms fitted to the top of 'P' and 'Q' turrets. The first flying off by a 1¬Ω Strutter was from Australias 'Q' turret on 4 April 1918. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.Roberts, Battlecruisers, p. 92 At the end of World War I, Australia was described as \\"the least obsolescent of her class\\".Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 284 After the war, both anti-aircraft guns were replaced by a pair of QF 4-inch Mark V guns on manually operated high-angle mounts in January 1920. Their elevation limits were ‚àí5¬∞ to 80¬∞. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 10‚Äì15 rounds per minute.

In the event of widespread conflict, the fleet units would come under Admiralty control, and would be merged to form larger fleets for regional defence. Australia was the only Dominion to purchase a full fleet unit, and while the New Zealand-funded battlecruiser was donated to the Royal Navy outright, no other nation purchased ships under the fleet unit plan.Burt, British Battleships of World War One, p. 91Roberts, Battlecruisers, p. 29 On 9 December 1909, a cable was sent by Governor-General Lord Dudley to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl of Crewe, requesting that construction of three cruisers and an Indefatigable-class battlecruiser start at earliest opportunity.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 92 It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy's practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain, or it might have reflected the preferences of the First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, preferences not widely shared.Roberts, Battlecruisers, pp. 29‚Äì31 The Australian Government decided on the name Australia, as this would avoid claims of favouritism or association with a particular state.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 172 The ship's badge depicted the Federation Star overlaid by a naval crown, and her motto was \\"Endeavour\\", reflecting both an idealisation of Australians' national spirit and attitude, and a connection to James Cook and HM Bark Endeavour. On 6 May 1910, George Reid, Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, sent a telegram cable to the Australian Government suggesting that the ship be named after the newly crowned King George V, but this was rebuffed.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 171‚Äì172 Bids for construction were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company to construct the hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 171 The total cost of construction was set at ¬£2 million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London. Australias keel was laid at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was assigned the yard number 402.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 34HMAS Australia built by John Brown Clydebank, Clydebuilt Ships Database The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, in a ceremony which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate.Roberts, Battlecruisers, p. 102 While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had to be used in some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship ¬£295,000 under budget.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 173 During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill attempted to arrange for Australia to remain in British waters on completion.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 299 Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron. Australia sailed for Devonport, Devon in mid-February 1913 to begin her acceptance trials. Testing of the guns, torpedoes, and machinery was successful, but it was discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser to dock for repairs. Australia was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth on 21 June 1913. Two days later, Rear Admiral George Patey, the first Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Fleet, raised his flag aboard Australia.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 24 At launch, the standard ship's company was 820, over half of which were Royal Navy personnel; the other half was made up of Australian-born RAN personnel, or Britons transferring from the Royal Navy to the RAN.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 25 Accommodation areas were crowded, with each man having only of space to sling his hammock when Australia was fully manned. Moreover, the ventilation system was designed for conditions in Europe, and was inadequate for the climate in and around Australia.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 68 On delivery, Australia was the largest warship in the Southern Hemisphere.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 97 Operational history =Voyage to Australia= Following her commissioning, Australia hosted several official events. On 30 June, King George V and Edward, Prince of Wales, visited Australia to farewell the ship.R√ºger, Nation, Empire and Navy, p. 179 During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship's quarterdeck‚Äîthe first time a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since Francis Drake.R√ºger, Nation, Empire and Navy, p. 180 On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation p. 174 That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on Australia prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his role was to promote the ship as a symbol of the bond between Australia and the United Kingdom. Australia, Sydney, and Melbourne shortly after the Australian fleet unit's first entry into Sydney Harbour. The near ship's torpedo net supports are visible along the hull. Australia was escorted by the light cruiser during the voyage to Australia. On 25 July, the two ships left England for South Africa: the visit was part of an agreement between the Prime Ministers of Australia and South Africa to promote the link between the two nations, along with the nations' links to the rest of the British Empire.R√ºger, Nation, Empire and Navy, pp. 180‚Äì182 The two ships were anchored in Table Bay from 18 to 26 August, during which the ships' companies participated in parades and receptions, while tens of thousands of people came to observe the ships.R√ºger, Nation, Empire and Navy, p. 181 The two ships also visited Simon's Town, while Australia additionally called into Durban.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 175 No other major ports were visited on the voyage, and the warships were instructed to avoid all major Australian ports. Australia and Sydney reached Jervis Bay on 2 October, where they rendezvoused with the rest of the RAN fleet (the cruisers and , and the destroyers , , and ). The seven warships prepared for a formal fleet entry into Sydney Harbour. On 4 October, Australia led the fleet into Sydney Harbour, where responsibility for Australian naval defence was passed from the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron, commanded by King-Hall aboard HMS Cambrian, to the RAN, commanded by Patey aboard Australia. =Early service= In her first year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as possible, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 179 During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 32‚Äì33 Australia at anchor in Queensland waters During July 1914, Australia and other units of the RAN fleet were on a training cruise in Queensland waters.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 30 On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learnt through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought that there would be imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 2‚Äì3 Three days later, the Board learnt that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, Australia was recalled to Sydney to take on coal and stores.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 3 On 3 August, the RAN was placed under Admiralty control.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pgs. 30, 32 Orders for RAN warships were prepared over the next few days: Australia was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the China Station, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (particularly those of the German East Asia Squadron) in the Australian Station before doing so.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 32 Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, was aware of Australias presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral's plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of Australia and the China Squadron forced his fleet to relocate to other seas.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 33Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 24‚Äì25 =World War I= Securing local waters The British Empire declared war on Germany on 5 August, and the RAN swung into action. Australia had departed Sydney the night before, and was heading north to rendezvous with other RAN vessels south of German New Guinea.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 9‚Äì10 The German colonial capital of Rabaul was considered a likely base of operations for von Spee, and Patey put together a plan to clear the harbour. Australias role was to hang back: if the armoured cruisers and were present, the other RAN vessels would lure them into range of the battlecruiser. The night-time operation was executed on 11 August, and no German ships were found in the harbour. Over the next two days, Australia and the other ships unsuccessfully searched the nearby bays and coastline for the German ships and any wireless stations, before returning to Port Moresby to refuel.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 13‚Äì14 In late August, Australia and escorted a New Zealand occupation force to German Samoa.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 35 Patey believed that the German fleet was likely to be in the eastern Pacific, and Samoa would be a logical move.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 51 Providing protection for the New Zealand troopships was a beneficial coincidence, although the timing could have been better, as an Australian expedition to occupy German New Guinea departed from Sydney a few days after the New Zealand force left home waters‚ÄîAustralia was expected to support both, but Patey only learned of the expeditions after they had commenced their journeys.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 50‚Äì55 The battlecruiser left Port Moresby on 17 August and was met by Melbourne en route on 20 August. The next day, they reached Noum√©a and the New Zealand occupation force, consisting of the troopships Moeraki and Monowai, the French cruiser , and three s.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 59 The grounding of Monowai delayed the expedition's departure until 23 August; the ships reached Suva, Fiji on 26 August, and arrived off Apia early in the morning of 30 August.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 60 The city surrendered without a fight, freeing Australia and Melbourne to depart at noon on 31 August to meet the Australian force bound for Rabaul.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 60‚Äì61 Australia leading the ships of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force into Rabaul Harbour on 12 September 1914 The Australian invasion force had mustered off the Louisiade Archipelago by 9 September; the assembled ships included Australia, the cruisers , and , the destroyers , , and , the submarines and , the auxiliary cruiser , the storeship , three colliers and an oiler.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 78 The force sailed north, and at 06:00 on 11 September, Australia deployed two picket boats to secure Karavia Bay for the expeditionary force's transports and supply ships.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 81 Later that day, Australia captured the German steamer Sumatra off Cape Tawui.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 544 After this, the battlecruiser stood off, in case she was required to shell one of the two wireless stations the occupation force was attempting to capture.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 90 The German colony was captured, and on 15 September, Australia departed for Sydney.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 93‚Äì94 Pursuit of von Spee The presence of Australia around the former German colonies, combined with the likelihood of Japan declaring war on Germany, prompted von Spee to withdraw his ships from the region. On 13 August, the East Asia Squadron‚Äîexcept for , which was sent to prey on British shipping in the Indian Ocean‚Äîhad begun to move eastwards.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 29 After appearing off Samoa on 14 September, then attacking Tahiti eight days later, von Spee led his force to South America, and from there planned to sail for the Atlantic.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 36 Patey was ordered on 17 September to head back north with Australia and Sydney to protect the Australian expeditionary force.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 100 On 1 October, Australia, Sydney, Montcalm, and Encounter headed north from Rabaul to find the German ships, but turned around to return at midnight, after receiving an Admiralty message about the Tahiti attack.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 103‚Äì104 Although Patey suspected that the Germans were heading for South America and wanted to follow with Australia, the Admiralty was unsure that the intelligence was accurate, and tasked the battlecruiser with patrolling around Fiji in case they returned. Australia reached Suva on 12 October, and spent the next four weeks patrolling the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: despite Patey's desires to range out further, Admiralty orders kept him chained to Suva until early November.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 121‚Äì124 As Patey predicted, von Spee had continued east, and it was not until his force inflicted the first defeat on the Royal Navy in 100 years at the Battle of Coronel that Australia was allowed to pursue. Departing on 8 November, the battlecruiser replenished coal from a pre-positioned collier on 14 November, and reached Chamela Bay (near Manzanillo, Mexico) 12 days later.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 125 Patey was made commander of a multinational squadron tasked with preventing the German squadron from sailing north to Canadian waters, or following them if they attempted to enter the Atlantic via the Panama Canal or around Cape Horn. Patey's ships included Australia, the British light cruiser and the Japanese cruisers , , and the ex- Russian battleship Hizen. The ships made for the Galapagos Islands, which were searched from 4 to 6 December.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 126 After finding no trace of von Spee's force, the Admiralty ordered Patey to investigate the South American coast from Perlas Island down to the Gulf of Guayaquil. The German squadron had sailed for the Atlantic via Cape Horn, and was defeated by a British fleet after attempting to raid the Falkland Islands on 8 December.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 37 Patey's squadron learned of this 10 December, while off the Gulf of Panama; Australias personnel were disappointed that they did not have the chance to take on Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Nevertheless, the battlecruiser's presence in the Pacific during 1914 had provided an important counter to the German armoured cruisers, and enabled the RAN to participate in the Admiralty's global strategy. Moreover, it is unlikely that the attack on Rabaul would have gone ahead had Australia not been available to protect the landing force.Jones, A Fall From Favour, p. 57 North Sea operations As the threat of a German naval attack had been removed by the destruction of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 127 Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 262 Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915‚ÄîAustralia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 127‚Äì128Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, pgs. 35, 38 During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 128 Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship‚Äîthe former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann‚Äîto stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow to keep pace with the battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk. Australia in the Firth of Forth during February 1915 Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw the need for dedicated battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked Australia to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, Australia was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and Australia reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 263‚Äì264 She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey and the leader of the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard Australia. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 264‚Äì267 During her time with the 2nd BCS, Australias operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North Sea area in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 264 These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.Stevens, in Stevens, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 167‚Äì168 Australia joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 269 By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and Australia returned to Rosyth.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 269‚Äì270 On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 270 The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused Australia and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 270‚Äì271 From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 271 Forth Bridge On the morning of 21 April, Australia and her sister ships sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 272 The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 272‚Äì273 On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 274 The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack, which, combined with the weather conditions, caused Australia to collide with sister ship twice in three minutes. Procedural errors were found to be the cause of the collisions, which saw Australia (the more heavily damaged of the two ships) docked for six weeks of repairs between April and June 1916.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 38 Initial inspections of the damage were made in a floating dock on the River Tyne, but the nature of the damage required a diversion to Devonport, Devon for the actual repair work. The repairs were completed more quickly than expected, and Australia rejoined the 2nd BCS Squadron at Rosyth on 9 June, having missed the Battle of Jutland. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40, which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off. Both the British and German fleets returned home, with two British cruisers sunk by submarines and a German dreadnought battleship damaged by a torpedo.Marder, From the Dreadnought to Scapa Flow, vol. III, pp. 287‚Äì296 The year 1917 saw a continuation of the battlecruiser's routine of exercises and patrols into the North Sea, with few incidents. During this year Australias activities were limited to training voyages between Rosyth and Scapa Flow and occasional patrols to the north-east of Britain in search of German raiders.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 279, 281 In May, while preparing the warship for action stations, a 12-inch shell became jammed in the shell hoist when its fuze became hooked onto a projection.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 279 After the magazines were evacuated, Lieutenant-Commander F. C. Darley climbed down the hoist and successfully removed the fuze.Burt, British Battleships of World War One, p. 104 On 26 June, King George V visited the ship. On 12 December, Australia was involved in a second collision, this time with the battlecruiser . Following this accident, she underwent three weeks of repairs from December 1917 until January 1918.Roberts, Battlecruisers, p. 123 During the repair period, Australia became the first RAN ship to launch an aircraft, when a Sopwith Pup took off from her quarterdeck on 18 December.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 8 On 30 December, Australia shelled a suspected submarine contact, the only time during her deployment with the 2nd BCS that she fired on the enemy. A Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter launching from one of Australias turrets In February 1918, the call went out for volunteers to participate in a special mission to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 51 Although many aboard Australia volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel‚Äî10 sailors and an engineering lieutenant‚Äîwere selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 281 The lieutenant was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his efforts.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 52 The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 282 All ten sailors survived‚ÄîAustralia was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid‚Äîand three were awarded the DSM, while another three were mentioned in dispatches.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 593 One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but he did not receive the award. During 1918, Australia and the Grand Fleet's other capital ships on occasion escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 303 From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Australia, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot.Massie, Castles of Steel, p. 748 The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter scout plane on 14 May, Australia started carrying two aircraft‚Äîa Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter‚Äîand operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25‚Äì26 June and 29‚Äì30 July. During September and October, Australia and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney. War's end When the armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November 1918 to end World War I, one of the conditions was that the German High Seas Fleet was to be interred at Scapa Flow. The German fleet crossed the North Sea, and on 21 November, the British Grand Fleet sailed out to meet it; Australia led the port division of the fleet. Australia then escorted the battlecruiser to Scapa Flow, and was assigned as the German vessel's guardship.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 53 Australia subsequently formed part of the force which guarded the High Seas Fleet during late 1918 and early 1919, and spent much of her time either at anchor at Scapa Flow, or conducting patrols in the North Sea.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 99 This monotonous duty contributed to low morale among some sections of the ship's crew. Group portrait of Australias ship's company in December 1918 After being formally farewelled by the Prince of Wales and First Sea Lord Rosslyn Wemyss on 22 April 1919, Australia departed from Portsmouth for home the next day.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914‚Äì1918, p. 334 She sailed in company with for the first part of the voyage, but the light cruiser later had to detach to tow the submarine . Australia arrived in Fremantle on 28 May 1919, the first time the ship had seen home waters in four and a half years.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 56 Despite returning home, the battlecruiser remained under Admiralty control until 1 August 1919.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 57 Australia was not awarded any official battle honours, although personnel aboard the battlecruiser and her successor claimed the operations in the Pacific, the North Sea patrol duties, and the battlecruiser's presence at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet as unofficial honours.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 18, 26 Following a reorganisation of RAN battle honours in 2010, the honours \\"Rabaul 1914\\" and \\"North Sea 1915‚Äì18\\" were retroactively awarded on 1 March 2010.Royal Australian Navy, Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle HonoursRoyal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours =Mutiny= Australias ship's company had consistently suffered from low morale since the battlecruiser entered service, and the proportion of Australias sailors who were placed on disciplinary charges during World War I was among the highest in the RAN.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 97 Many of the Australian sailors were chafing under the severity of naval discipline and what they saw as excessive punishment for minor breaches; one example was of a sailor who was charged with desertion, imprisoned for three months, and lost all pay for staying out too late on Armistice Day. Factors which contributed to low morale and poor discipline included frustration at not participating in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of illness, limited opportunities for leave, delays or complete lack of deferred pay, and poor-quality food.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 98-9 The continuation of strict wartime routines and discipline after the armistice frustrated the ship's crew. There was also the perception that Australias British personnel were being promoted faster than their Australian counterparts and were dominating leadership positions. The battlecruiser's arrival in Fremantle on 28 May was met with extensive hospitality, which was reciprocated where possible by the sailors with invitations and tours of their vessel.Stevens, in Bell & Ellerman, Naval mutinies of the twentieth century, p. 131 There were opportunities for shore leave, but these were limited as Australia was only in port for three days, and had to sail early on 1 June for Melbourne.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 100 Personnel from Australia march down a decorated street in 1919, following the battlecruiser's return to Sydney Representatives of the ship's company approached Captain Claude Cumberlege to ask for a one-day delay on departure; this would allow the sailors to have a full weekend of leave, give Perth-born personnel the chance to visit their families, and give personnel another chance to invite people aboard. Cumberlege replied that as Australia had a tight schedule of \\"welcome home\\" port visits, such delays could not even be considered. The next morning, at around 10:30, between 80 and 100 sailors gathered in front of 'P' turret, some in working uniform, others who had just returned from shore leave still in libertyman rig.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 101 Cumberlege sent the executive officer to find out why the men had assembled, and on learning that they were repeating the previous day's request for a delay in departure, went down to address them. In a strict, legalistic tone, he informed the sailors that delaying Australias departure was impossible, and ordered them to disperse. The group obeyed this order, although some were vocal in their displeasure. Shortly after, Australia was ready to depart, but when the order to release the mooring lines and get underway was given, Cumberlege was informed that the stokers had abandoned the boiler rooms.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 102 After the assembly on deck, some sailors had masked themselves with black handkerchiefs, and encouraged or intimidated the stokers on duty into leaving their posts, leaving the navy's flagship stranded at the buoy, in full view of dignitaries and crowds lining the nearby wharf.Stevens, in Bell & Ellerman, Naval mutinies of the twentieth century, pp. 131‚Äì132 The senior non- commissioned officers, along with sailors drafted from other departments, were sent to the boiler room to get Australia moving, and departure from Fremantle was only delayed by an hour. Australian naval historians David Stevens and Tom Frame disagree on what happened next. Stevens states that Cumberledge assembled the ship's company in the early afternoon, read the Articles of War, lectured them on the seriousness of refusing duty, then ordered the stokers to go to their stations, which they did meekly.Stevens, in Bell & Ellerman, Naval mutinies of the twentieth century, p. 132 Frame claims the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge cleared lower deck and spoke to the sailors.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 130 After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship's senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a mutiny and arrested pending a court- martial, which was held aboard on 20 June, after Australia arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had \\"joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence\\", and they were sentenced to imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 103‚Äì105 A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame disagree on details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty.Stevens, in Bell & Ellerman, Naval mutinies of the twentieth century, p. 133Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 103 Both authors agree that these men were tried by the captain while Australia was still at sea, and punished with 90 days each in cells. Following the court-martial of the five ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within government over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 105 Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured the government and the Admiralty to pardon the men.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 106 The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December.Frame and Baker, Mutiny!, p. 107 However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, pp. 131‚Äì132 The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 56‚Äì57Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 132 =Post-war= In May 1920, Australia participated in celebrations and naval activities associated with the visit of the Prince of Wales.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 180 From July to November 1920, an Avro 504 floatplane of the Australian Air Corps was embarked aboard Australia as part of a series of trials intended to cumulate in the creation of a naval aviation branch.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 53ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 14 The aircraft was stored on the quarterdeck next to 'Q' turret, and was deployed and recovered by derrick. Inter-service rivalry and the ship's reduction to non- seagoing status in September prevented further operations. Following the demise of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and Australia did not have a clear role.Jones, A Fall From Favour, p. 58 As a result, post-war budget cuts prompted the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by Australia could be better used elsewhere in the RAN.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 65 In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, Australia was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice. Decommissioning and fate Australia returned to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, and there is no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.Jones, A Fall From Favour, pp. 58‚Äì60 The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was a mutual naval arms limitation and disarmament treaty between the five major naval powers of the time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France.Kerr, A Loss More Symbolic Than Material?, in Semaphore, p. 1 One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted as part of the Royal Navy for the purposes of the treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 180‚Äì182 This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treatyDennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 186 until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.States Parties, International Campaign to Ban Landmines Garden Island in 1924 When Australia was decommissioned in 1921, some of her equipment was removed for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 Cabinet decision confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 182 Between November 1923 and January 1924, ¬£68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to tertiary education centres (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing Australias 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, and the cost of building suitable structures was excessive.Jones, A Fall From Favour, p. 59 It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels with the rest of the ship. There was also a proposal to remove Australias conning tower and install it on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of was erected as a monument at Bradleys Head.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), pp. 39‚Äì40 The ship's outer port propeller is on display at the Australian War Memorial, while other artefacts are in the collections of the War Memorial, the Australian National Maritime Museum, and the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), p. 40 HMAS Brisbane recovers the scuttling party from Australia shortly before the latter's sinking The scuttling was originally scheduled for Anzac Day (25 April) 1924, but was brought forward to 12 April, so the visiting British Special Service Squadron could participate.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 182‚Äì183 On the day of the sinking, Australia was towed out to a point north east of Sydney Heads.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 38 Under the terms of the Washington Treaty, the battlecruiser needed to be sunk in water that was deep enough to make it infeasible to refloat her at a future date. The former flagship was escorted by the Australian warships Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Anzac, and Stalwart, the ships of the Special Service Squadron, and several civilian ferries carrying passengers.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 17 Many personnel volunteered to be part of the scuttling party, but only those who had served aboard her were selected.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 66 At 14:30, the scuttling party set the charges, opened all seacocks, and cleared the ship.Stevens, in Stevens & Reeve, The Navy and the Nation, p. 166 Explosive charges blew a hole in the hull a few minutes later, but it took 20 minutes for the intake of water to bring holes cut in the battlecruiser's upper flanks to the waterline. The angle of list increased significantly, causing the three spare 12-inch barrels lashed to the deck to break free and roll overboard, before Australia inverted completely and began to sink stern- first. Australia submerged completely at 14:51; a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft dropped a wreath where the warship had sunk, while Brisbane fired a rolling 21-gun salute. The wreck was gazetted as being at , below.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), p. 41 However, there were discrepancies with other sources, and the exact location of Australia was unknown. Australia listing to port and sinking There are two schools of thought surrounding the decision to scuttle the battlecruiser. The first is that sinking Australia was a major blow to the nation's ability to defend herself. Following the battlecruiser's scuttling, the most powerful warships in the RAN were four old light cruisers. The battlecruiser had served as a deterrent to German naval action against Australia during the war, and with growing tensions between Japan and the United States of America, that deterrence might have been required if the nations had become openly hostile towards each other or towards Australia.Kerr, A Loss More Symbolic Than Material?, in Semaphore, pp. 1‚Äì2 The opposing argument is that, while an emotive and symbolic loss, the ship was obsolete, and would have been a drain on resources. Operating and maintaining the warship was beyond the capabilities of the RAN's post-war budgets, necessitating the ship's reduction in status in 1920 and assignment to reserve in 1921.A Loss More Symbolic Than Material?, in Semaphore, p. 2 Ammunition and replacement barrels for the main guns were no longer manufactured. To remain effective, Australia required major modernisation (including new propulsion machinery, increased armour and armament, and new fire control systems) at a cost equivalent to a new . In 1990, a large, unknown shipwreck was encountered by the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV Moana Wave 1 while surveying the path of the PacRimWest communications cable.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), p. 45 One of the survey ship's crew theorised that the wreck, located at in of water, was Australia, but Fugro kept the information to themselves until 2002, when the company's Australian branch mentioned the discovery during a conference. This piqued the interest of a member of the New South Wales Heritage Office, who requested copies of the company's data. The size and location of the ship pointed towards it being Australia, but the depth meant verification through inspection could only be achieved with a remote operated vehicle (ROV).Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), p. 47 The RAN was approached in 2007 for assistance, but although they supported the project, the RAN did not have the equipment to assist. In March 2007, the United States Navy loaned the deep-sea ROV CURV-21 to the Australian Government, to locate and recover a Black Hawk helicopter which crashed during the Australian response to the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. While en route back to Australia, the ROV, carried aboard Defence Maritime Services vessel , was directed to Fugro's coordinates at the request of the NSW Heritage Office to verify and inspect the wreck.Cubby, First Navy Flagship Found off Sydney Video footage captured by the ROV allowed the NSW Heritage Office to confirm that the wreck was Australia by matching features like the superstructure and masts to historical photographs.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), p. 63 Although initially sinking stern- first, the battlecruiser levelled out as she sank, with the aft mast the first to strike the bottom.Duncan, Battlecruiser HMAS Australia (1), pp. 73‚Äì74 After hitting the seabed, Australia slid about to her final resting place.

One of two Kent-subclass ships ordered for the RAN in 1924, Australia was laid down in Scotland in 1925, and entered service in 1928. Apart from an exchange deployment to the Mediterranean from 1934 to 1936, during which she became involved in the planned British response to the Abyssinia Crisis, Australia operated in local and South-West Pacific waters until World War II began. The cruiser remained near Australia until mid-1940, when she was deployed for duties in the eastern Atlantic, including hunts for German ships and participation in Operation Menace. During 1941, Australia operated in home and Indian Ocean waters, but was reassigned as flagship of the ANZAC Squadron in early 1942. As part of this force (which was later redesignated Task Force 44, then Task Force 74), Australia operated in support of United States naval and amphibious operations throughout South-East Asia until the start of 1945, including involvement in the battles at the Coral Sea and Savo Island, the amphibious landings at Guadalcanal and Leyte Gulf, and numerous actions during the New Guinea campaign. She was forced to withdraw following a series of kamikaze attacks during the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. The prioritisation of shipyard work in Australia for British Pacific Fleet vessels saw the Australian cruiser sail to England for repairs, where she was at the end of the war. During the late 1940s, Australia served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, and participated in several port visits to other nations, before being retasked as a training ship in 1950. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1954, and sold for scrapping in 1955. Design Australia was one of seven warships built to the Kent design of County-class heavy cruiser, which were based on design work by Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt. She was designed with a standard displacement of 10,000 tons, a length between perpendiculars of , a length overall of , a beam of , and a maximum draught of .Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 21 The propulsion machinery consisted of eight Yarrow superheated boilers feeding Curtis high- pressure and Parsons low-pressure geared turbines. This delivered up to 80,000 shaft horsepower to the cruiser's four three-bladed propellers. The cruiser's top speed was , with a range of , while her economical range and cruising speed was at . The ship's company consisted of 64 officers and 678 sailors in 1930; this dropped to 45 officers and 654 sailors from 1937 to 1941. While operating as flagship, Australias company was 710. During wartime, the ship's company increased to 815. =Armament and armour= Australia was designed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets ('A' and 'B' forward, 'X' and 'Y' aft) as primary armament, with 150 shells per gun.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships, 1914‚Äì1945, p. 86 Secondary armament consisted of four 4-inch guns in four single mounts, with 200 shells per gun, and four 2-pounder pom- poms for anti-aircraft defence, with 1,000 rounds each. A mixture of .303-inch machine guns were carried for close defence work: initially this consisted of four Vickers machine guns and twelve Lewis machine guns, although four Lewis guns were later removed. Two sets of quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted. Four 3-pounder quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. During her 1939 modernisation, the four single 4-inch guns were replaced by four twin Mark XVI guns. The torpedo tubes were removed in 1942, and the 8-inch 'X' turret was taken off in 1945. The close-range anti-aircraft armament of the ship fluctuated during her career. During the mid-1930s, two quadruple .5-inch machine gun mounts were installed to supplement the .303-inch weapons.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 101 These were replaced in late 1943 by seven single 20mm Oerlikons. By early 1944, all seven Oerlikons had been upgraded to double mountings. These were in turn replaced by eight single 40 mm Bofors guns in 1945. A Supermarine Walrus stowed on Australias catapult while the ship was alongside in Brisbane during 1937 Australia was designed to carry a single amphibious aircraft: a Supermarine Seagull III aircraft, which was replaced in 1936 by a Supermarine Walrus. Both aircraft were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force's Fleet Co-operation Unit; initially by No. 101 Flight RAAF, which was expanded in 1936 to form No. 5 Squadron RAAF, then renumbered in 1939 to No. 9 Squadron RAAF.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 20 As the aircraft catapult was not installed until September 1935, the Seagull was initially lowered into the water by the ship's recovery crane to launch under its own power. The catapult and Walrus were removed in October 1944. Armour aboard Australia was initially limited to an armour deck over the machinery spaces and magazines, ranging from in thickness. Armour plate was also fitted to the turrets (up to thick) and the conning tower ( thick). Anti-torpedo bulges were also fitted. During 1938 and 1939, belt armour up to thick was fitted along the waterline to provide additional protection to the propulsion machinery. Acquisition and construction Australia was ordered in 1924 as part of a five-year plan to develop the RAN.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 140 She was laid down by John Brown and Company at their shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, on 26 August 1925.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 22 The cruiser was launched on 17 March 1927 by Dame Mary Cook, wife of Sir Joseph Cook, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and former Australian Prime Minister. The cruiser was initially fitted with short exhaust funnels, but during sea trials of Australia and other Kent-class ships, it was found that smoke from the boilers was affecting the bridge and aft control position.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 102 The funnel design was subsequently lengthened by ; the taller funnels on the under-construction were later switched over to Australia as she neared completion. Australia under way during sea trials. The original, shorter exhaust funnels are still fitted to the cruiser. When the ship's badge came up for consideration on 26 December 1926, both Richard Lane-Poole, commander of the Australian Squadron, and William Napier, First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board disapproved of the design previously carried by the battlecruiser , and requested new designs.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 26 On 26 July 1927, it was decided to use the Coat of arms of Australia as the basis for the badge, with the shield bearing the symbols of the six states and the Federation Star crest depicted in the design.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 27 No motto was given to the ship, but when the badge design was updated prior to the planned 1983 acquisition of the British aircraft carrier (which was to be renamed HMAS Australia), the motto from the battlecruiser, \\"Endeavour\\", was added. The warship was commissioned into the RAN on 24 April 1928. Construction of Australia cost 1.9 million pounds, very close to the estimated cost.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 78 Australia and sister ship (also constructed by John Brown) were the only County-class vessels built in Scotland. Operational history =Early career= Australia left Portsmouth for her namesake country on 3 August 1928 after completing sea trials.HMAS Australia (II), Royal Australian Navy During the voyage, the cruiser visited Canada, the United States of America, several Pacific islands, and New Zealand before she reached Sydney on 23 October. Following the start of the Great Depression, the RAN fleet was downscaled in 1930 to three active ships (Australia, Canberra, and seaplane carrier ) while one of the S-class destroyers would remain active at a time, with a reduced ship's company.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 141 In 1932, Australia cruised to the Pacific islands. In 1933, she visited New Zealand. On 10 December 1934, Australia was sent to the United Kingdom on exchange duty, with the Duke of Gloucester, who had visited Victoria for the state's centenary of foundation the month previous, aboard. The cruiser reached Portsmouth on 28 March 1935, and was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. Australia returned to England from 21 June to 12 September to represent Australia at King George V's Silver Jubilee Naval Review at Spithead.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 103 Following the outbreak of the Abyssinian crisis, Australia began to train for a potential war.Sears, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 95 Australias initial role in any British assault on the Italian Navy was to cover the withdrawal of the aircraft carrier after an air attack on the base at Taranto. The crisis eased before the need for British involvement occurred. Australia remained in the Mediterranean until 14 July 1936, then visited Gallipoli in company with the new light cruiser , before the two ships sailed for Australia.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 145 They arrived in Sydney on 11 August. During the cruiser's time on exchange, the British cruiser operated with the RAN. Australia transiting the Panama Canal in March 1935 After returning, Australia spent the remainder of 1936 in the vicinity of Sydney and Jervis Bay, excluding a visit to Melbourne in November. The warship sailed to New Zealand in April 1937, then in July departed on a three-month northern cruise, with visits to ports in Queensland, New Guinea, and New Britain. Australia repeated her November visit to Melbourne, and cruised to Hobart in February 1938, before being placed in reserve on 24 April 1938. She underwent a modernisation refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, during which her single 4-inch guns were replaced with twin mountings, belt armour measuring up to thick was fitted over the machinery spaces, and handling arrangements for the ship's aircraft and boats were improved.Jeremey, Cockatoo Island, pp. 117‚Äì8 Although the modernisation was scheduled for completion in March 1939, inconsistencies between Australias construction and the supplied drawings caused delays.Jeremey, Cockatoo Island, p. 118 The cruiser was recommissioned on 28 August, but did not leave the dockyard until 28 September. =World War II= 1939‚Äì1941 Following the outbreak of World War II, Australia was initially assigned to Australian waters. From 28 November to 1 December, Australia, Canberra, and Sydney hunted for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 153 From 10 to 20 January 1940, Australia was part of the escort for Anzac convoy US 1 as it proceeded from Sydney to Fremantle, then sailed with it to the edge of the Australia Station en route to Colombo, before returning to Fremantle.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 91‚Äì3 On arrival, Australia relieved as the cruiser assigned to the western coast until 6 February, when she was in turn relieved by and returned to the east coast.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 103 On 12 May, Australia and Canberra left Fremantle to escort Anzac convoy US 3 to Cape Town.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 23 After arriving on 31 May, the two ships were offered for service under the Royal Navy; Australia was accepted for service in European waters, although she spent most of June escorting ship around southern and western Africa.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 170 On 3 July, Australia and the carrier were ordered to sail to Dakar, where the cruiser was shadowing the French battleship Richelieu and preparing to deny her use to the Vichy French if required. Australia and Hermes reached the rendezvous in the early morning of 5 July. Attempts to disable the battleship (which was anchored in harbour?) were made by boat and air during 7 and 8 July; on the second day, Australia fired in anger for the first time when a French aircraft flew near the Allied ships and dropped bombs with no effect.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 171 The Australian cruiser left Dakar on 9 July, and caught up to an England-bound convoy two days later. They arrived at the River Clyde on 16 July, and Australia was assigned to the Royal Navy's 1st Cruiser Squadron, based at Scapa Flow, four days later. During late July, the cruiser joined British ships off Norway in an unsuccessful search for the German battleship Gneisenau. During August, Australia and searched around the Faroe Islands and Bear Island for German trawlers.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 214 At the start of September, Australia was assigned to Operation Menace‚Äîthe Allied effort to install the Free French in Vichy-controlled Dakar‚Äîas a replacement for the torpedoed British cruiser .Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 114 On the morning of 19 September, shortly after relieving on patrol off Dakar, Australia located three French cruisers, which she and Cumberland began to shadow until losing sight in the dark.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 216 One of the French ships, the cruiser Gloire suffered engine troubles and turned back to Konakri, encountering Australia shortly after. The Australian cruiser was ordered to escort Gloire to Casablanca, which the French cruiser agreed to.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 217 The two ships remained together until the morning of 21 September, when Gloires captain promised his opposite on Australia that the French ship would complete the voyage unescorted, and the Australian cruiser sailed to intercept the main body of the Allied fleet, which was met the next day. On the morning of 23 September, the cruiser was fired on by shore batteries at Dakar while intercepting and driving back two Fantasque-class destroyers, but did not receive damage.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 217-8 That afternoon, Australia and the British destroyers and engaged the French destroyer L'Audacieux, setting her on fire. On 24 September, despite poor visibility, Australia joined other Allied ships in shelling Dakar and the French warships in the harbour; during the withdrawal to the rest of the fleet, the Australian cruiser was unsuccessfully attacked by high-altitude bombers.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 218-9 On 25 September, Australia and shelled French ships anchored at Dakar. They damaged a destroyer and several cruisers before Australia was hit by two 6-inch shells and her Walrus was shot down with all aboard killed, after which the two ships withdrew.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 158 Operation Menace was abandoned as a failure on 26 September, and Australia was ordered to return to the United Kingdom two days later.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 219-20 During early October, Australia escorted a group of troop transports returning from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom. On 29 October, Australia recovered nine of the thirteen crew from a Short Sunderland flying boat which crashed off Greenock, Scotland during a gale; the other four were carried away by the heavy seas during the rescue. The cruiser underwent a refit in Liverpool during November and December. During a German air raid on the night of 20 December, a torpedo was dropped on the dry-dock Australia was berthed in, but this landed alongside the ship and did not explode.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 245 The ship was damaged during an air raid the following night: the blast from a bomb landing near the port side cracked several scuttles and damaged the catapult. Australia spent the first part of January 1941 escorting Convoy WS5B from the British Isles to the Middle East via South Africa.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 511 On 22 January, after handing the convoy over to off Mombasa, the cruiser joined the unsuccessful search for the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. Following this and searches for the auxiliary cruisers Pinguin and Atlantis in the Indian Ocean, Australia sailed for Sydney with two troopships, arriving on 24 March.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 120 The cruiser then escorted Convoy US10 for the first leg of the Australia to Suez run, after which she sailed to Singapore at the end of the month to collect Admiral Ragnar Colvin and his staff following the Singapore Conference. During June, Australia escorted convoys across the Tasman Sea, then delivered Convoy US11A to Trincomalee in mid-July. The ship was then assigned to the South Atlantic Station. During November, the cruiser sailed to the Kerguelen Islands during searches for German commerce raiders, and after finding evidence of enemy activity, deployed magnetic sea mines in case they returned. As of 2008, the mines were still present.Rubin, Antarctica, p. 238 Prompted by the loss of and the deteriorating situation in South-east Asia, Australia was ordered on 3 December to hand Convoy WS12X to HMS Dorsetshire, then make for home. On 29 December, the cruiser was designated Flagship of the Australian Squadron. 1942 On 31 January, Australia and sailed from Sydney to Wellington.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 553 In February 1942, the Australian cruiser became flagship of the newly formed ANZAC Squadron. In early March, Australia was assigned to shell Gasmata in New Britain.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 9 However, on 7 March, the ships for the operation were recalled, and were used three days later to provide long-range protection for the American aircraft carriers and while they launched an air raid in retaliation to the Japanese capture of Lae and Salamaua. After the raid, Australia and the Anzac Squadron sailed for Noum√©a.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 10 On the evening of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship's stokers was stabbed fourteen times, and died from peritonitis during the night.Clark, The Statute of Westminster and the murder in HMAS Australia, 1942, p. 18 Before dying, the stoker informed the ship's surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other stokers, which led to the attack. The two accused stokers were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Noum√©a.Clark, The Statute of Westminster and the murder in HMAS Australia, 1942, pp. 19‚Äì20 The stokers were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser's yardarm.Clark, The Statute of Westminster and the murder in HMAS Australia, 1942, pp. 21‚Äì2 However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb's aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences be put off at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an appeal for clemency was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment.Clark, The Statute of Westminster and the murder in HMAS Australia, 1942, pp. 22‚Äì3 This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions' behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the National Security Act, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated to the start of the war. The sentences of the two stokers were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.Clark, The Statute of Westminster and the murder in HMAS Australia, 1942, pp. 24‚Äì5 A Mitsubishi G4M bomber attacking Australia On 22 April, the Anzac Squadron was reclassified as Task Force 44; Australia remained flagship.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 24 Australia returned to Sydney in late April for a week of repairs and maintenance, primarily to the outer port propeller shaft.Jeremey, Cockatoo Island, p. 126 Around this time, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and on 1 May, Australia sailed with to rendezvous with American forces in the Coral Sea.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 41 At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace, who was embarked aboard Australia as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (Australia, the cruisers Hobart and , and the destroyers , and ) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 47 The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired on a group of eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 48‚Äì9 Australia and Chicago were able to manoeuvre out of the torpedoes' paths, and at least five aircraft were destroyed.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 50 At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships. Although accurate (Australia was surrounded by the spread), none of the ships were hit directly, and the only casualties (aboard Chicago) were from shrapnel. A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 52 Australia and the rest of the task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 53 On 13 June, Crace was replaced by Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley as commander of Task Force 44 and the flag officer embarked aboard Australia.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 113 A month later, on 14 July, Australia led Task Force 44 from Brisbane to rendezvous in Wellington with the amphibious assault force for the landings at Guadalcanal and the surrounding islands.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 124 The force left New Zealand for Fiji on 22 July, and conducted rehearsal landings at Koro Island from 28 to 31 July. They met the rest of the attack force (three carrier groups and more transports) south of Fiji on the evening of 1 August, then headed for the Solomon Islands.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 125 The various elements began to head for their positions on 6 August, with Australia leading Squadron X (with four other cruisers, nine destroyers, nine transports, and six store ships) towards the main landing site, on the north side of Guadalcanal.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 125‚Äì6 During the early morning of 7 August, Squadron X transited the channel between Guadalcanal and Savo Island, and reached the assault point off Lunga Point at 06:47.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 128‚Äì9 While moving into position, Australia and the other warships fired on shore targets sporadically, then commenced a coordinated bombardment before the first wave of landing craft hit the beach unopposed just after 08:00.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 129 Despite the efforts of the carrier air groups and interdiction attacks on Japanese air bases, the first of several retaliatory air attacks against Squadron X occurred at 13:23; each was driven off by the squadron's massed anti-aircraft fire, with no damage to Australia.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 132‚Äì3, 136‚Äì7Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 42 Anticipating a naval attack to occur during the night, Crutchley split his forces around Savo Island, with Australia leading Canberra, , and two destroyers on patrol of the southern waters, a second group of three heavy cruisers and two destroyers to patrol the northern passage, while the rest of the ships protected the transports or served as picket ships.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 137‚Äì8 Nothing occurred during the night of 7‚Äì8 August, and the same arrangement was assumed at 18:30 for the night of 8‚Äì9 August.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 138 At 20:45, Crutchley was recalled to meet urgently with US Admiral Richmond K. Turner, overall commander of the amphibious landings, aboard the transport to discuss the proposed withdrawal of the carrier groups, and Australia left the patrol group.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 139 The meeting concluded at 01:15 on 9 August, and instead of returning to the southern patrol, Crutchley ordered Australia to patrol around the transports.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 150 Just before 02:00, the southern patrol force was attacked by a six-ship Japanese task force, and Canberra was irreparably damaged. Three US cruisers were lost in the subsequent attack on the northern patrol force.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 104 Australia under way off the Solomon Islands in late August 1942 Once the transports completed unloading, the naval force withdrew over the course of 9 August; Australia reached Noum√©a on 13 August.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 153 The ships of Task Force 44 were replenished at Noum√©a, then sailed to rejoin the three carrier groups on 19 August, in response to intelligence that a large Japanese fleet was sailing to the Solomon Islands.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 161‚Äì2 After arrival on 21 August, Crutchley and Australia were placed in command of the carriers' combined surface defence group, including several cruisers and the battleship .Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 162 Air attacks between the Allied and Japanese forces occurred during 24‚Äì25 August; the Japanese fleet was driven off without Australia or the other warships having to engage directly.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 163‚Äì5 On 31 August, Task Force 44 was detached from the carrier groups and sailed for Brisbane, arriving on 3 September.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 165 Four days later, Australia sailed with the task force for Milne Bay, where Allied ships and shore positions had been attacked several times by Japanese warships.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 171‚Äì3 Task Force 44 did not make contact with any enemy vessels.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 173‚Äì4 After this, the ships were assigned to patrol the Coral Sea.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 286 1943 Australia and the rest of Task Force 44 were removed from patrol duties on 10 January 1943; no Japanese aircraft or ships were sighted during the three months on station. Task Force 44 was pulled back and split into smaller groups: two rapid response forces, and a third (made up of Australia and three American destroyers) sent to Moreton Bay for exercises.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 287 In early February, Australias group sailed to Sydney, where the cruiser was fitted with a new radar, then proceeded on 17 February to meet the convoy returning the 9th Division from the Middle East. The convoy arrived in Fremantle on 18 February, then sailed for the Great Australian Bight, where Australia and her escorts met them. The ships reached Sydney on 27 February without incident, and Australia and her destroyers returned to northern waters. On 15 March 1943, a new numbering system for USN fleets saw Task Force 44 become Task Force 74 of the United States Seventh Fleet.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 186Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 288 On 11 April, Australia was sent to investigate rumours of Japanese landings along the south-eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but found no evidence of Japanese activity. The ships of the task force continued on with convoy escorting, refits, and patrols until 29 June, when Australia and five other ships were deployed to keep the sea lines of communication through the Coral and Arafura Seas, and to assist any transports in these areas. After encountering no Japanese forces and receiving no calls for assistance, the ships withdrew to the Flinders Group on 4 July. Six days later, Task Force 74 was sent to Espiritu Santo to reinforce the United States Third Fleet, which had lost four cruisers to torpedoes (one sunk, three withdrawn for major repairs) while supporting the New Georgia Campaign.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 289‚Äì90 Arriving on 16 July, Australia and the other ships were assigned to Espiritu Santo's western waters.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 290 At sunset on 20 July, Task Force 74 was returning to Espiritu Santo when was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine: Crutchley believed that the submarine had fired at Australia at long range, but the speed of the task force may have been underestimated, causing the torpedoes to miss the heavy cruiser, while one hit the following Hobart.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 291 By October, Australia was back in Australian waters.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 330 At the start of the month, the cruiser was the only ship assigned to Task Force 74, but she was joined by the destroyer on 13 October, and the two ships arrived at Milne Bay two days later, in case of retaliatory sea attacks on the recently captured town of Finschhafen. The counterattack did not come, and the two ships sailed for Brisbane on 21 October, where the task force was built up to two cruisers and four destroyers. The ships then sailed for Milne Bay, where they remained until they were ordered to Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons, on 11 November to serve as support for the Third Fleet following the start of the Bougainville invasion.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 330, 334 Although Australia and the task force arrived on 13 November, they were ordered to return to Milne Bay two days later, as a USN cruiser division had arrived.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 334 On 15 December 1943, Australia and Task Force 74 participated in the landings at Arawe, through escorting the landing force, then performing pre-landing bombardment.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 342 Australia also led the landing and escort force for the landing at Cape Gloucester, departing from Milne Bay on the evening of 25 December. At 06:00 on 26 December, Australia commenced a two-and-a-half-hour shelling of targets near the Gloucester airstrip prior to the landing, after which she sailed to Buna, where she remained for the rest of the year.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 343‚Äì5 1944 In early January 1944, Australia returned to Milne Bay, before sailing to Sydney on 12 January for an eight-week refit.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 369 During the refit, Captain Farncomb was replaced by Captain Emile Dechaineux.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 380 On the morning of 7 February, Crutchley transferred his flag to ; the role of Flagship was returned to Australia on 21 March, three days after she rejoined Task Force 74 at Milne Bay.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 370, 380‚Äì1 On the morning of 20 April, Australia and Task Force 74 rendezvoused with three other task forces of the Seventh Fleet off Manus Island: the combined force was to support the amphibious landings at Aitape, Humboldt Bay, and Tanahmerah Bay.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 400‚Äì1 The next evening, Australia split off with her task force and the attack force for Tanahmerah Bay.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 402 The flotilla arrived off the bay at 03:00 on 22 April, and at 06:00, Australia led a half-hour shore bombardment to cover the first wave of the amphibious landing.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 403 After the bombardment, which allowed the 24th Infantry Division to land with minimal opposition, the warships withdrew to protect the transports.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 403‚Äì4 Later in the day, Australia led two destroyers along the coastline, destroying any Japanese barges or supply dumps they encountered.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 406 Task Force 74 remained in the Hollandia area for the rest of the month to provide support to the landed forces, and arrived in Seeadler Harbour on 4 May.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 407, 416 Australia and Task Force 74 returned to Tanahmerah Bay on 16 May, to escort troopships to Wakde Island.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 417 The task force left the troopships (which were also being escorted by Task Force 75) at 04:30 on 17 May, and commenced an hour-long shore bombardment of the area around Sawar and Sarmi just after 06:00. The task forces provided fire support during the Battle of Wakde, then sailed to Humboldt Bay for replenishment.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 417‚Äì21 On 25 May, the task force was temporarily redesignated Task Group 77.2, and sailed at 22:00 to provide escort, then fire support, for the amphibious landing at Biak.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 421 At 06:30 on 27 May, Australia bombarded Biak Island.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 422 Over the next few days, Australia and the ships under her command provided cover patrols and fire support for Allied forces ashore.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 423-4 Predicting a heavy naval response from the Japanese, Crutchley was ordered on 1 June to return to Humboldt Bay with Australia and Task Force 74, then form a combined fleet with Task Force 75, which was to take up station northeast of Biak nightly from 4 June and intercept any Japanese forces encountered.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 425 On the evening of 4 June, while en route, the fleet was attacked by Japanese dive-bombers; Australia was not damaged in the attack.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 426 Crutchley's force was withdrawn on 6 June to replenish at Humboldt Bay, then returned the next day.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 427 Aerial sightings of a Japanese force (three destroyers towing landing barges and three destroyers escorting, one of which was sunk by air attack) had been made during the day, and the Allied ships made radar contact at 23:19.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 429‚Äì31 At 23:31, just after the Japanese ships fired torpedoes, Crutchley ordered the destroyers under his command to close and attack, while he brought Australia and the other cruisers into range.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 431 The Japanese ships cast off their barges, turned, and fled, and Crutchley ordered the Allied destroyers to chase until 02:30 on 8 June, then retire; the cruisers broke off almost immediately as could not match the Japanese destroyers' speed.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 431‚Äì3 The Japanese escaped with minimal damage.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 433 On 12 June, the combined task force returned to Seeadler Harbour, and Crutchley left Australia, having completed his two-year assignment as Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Squadron.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 441 A day later, Commodore John Augustine Collins raised his flag on Australia as commander of both the Australian Squadron and Task Force 74; the first graduate of the Royal Australian Naval College placed in overall command of the RAN's ships. Australia spent most of June in harbour, and sailed on 24 June with Task Forces 74 and 75 to perform a pre-landing shore bombardment for the attack on Noemfoor Island.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 442 On the morning of 2 July, Australia bombarded Noemfoor Island, then was released before midday to sail for Hollandia, then on to Seeadler Harbour.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 443, 460 on 12 July, Australia led Task Force 74 to Aitape, where the warships were to provide naval gunfire support for Allied forces ashore, help in the interdiction of Japanese troop movements by barge along the coast, and destroy gun emplacements covering the surrounding waterways.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 461 On 14 July, Australia bombarded the Yakamal area of Aitape, then shelled the Marubian area on 17 July, before attacking Yakamal again on 20 July.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 462 On 22 July, Collins transferred his flag to Shropshire, and Australia departed with for maintenance dockings in Sydney. Australia (right) and (left) shelling Morotai Island The cruiser departed Sydney on 26 August in the company of twelve other ships from Task Forces 74 and 75; the combined force reached Seeadler Harbour on 1 September.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 480 Collins reembarked on 3 September, and Australia was assigned to the Morotai landings as lead ship of Task Group 75.2, part of the escort and bombardment force. The cruiser shelled the area around the landing site on Cape Gila from 06:50 to 07:40 on 15 September; this was cut short by ten minutes, as shell fragments from Australia were reported as falling close to the destroyer , which was positioned to cover the landings from the other side of the cape.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 485 The cruiser remained on station to provide fire support until the evening of 16 September, when Australia and the other ships normally assigned to Task Force 74 were permitted to withdraw to Mios Woendi.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 486 Australia remained there until 27 September, when Task Forces 74 and 75 sailed for Manus Island, where they were involved in exercising.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 500 During this time, the cruiser was visited by British Admiral of the Fleet Lord Roger Keyes. The bridge and forward superstructure of Australia in September 1944. This area was damaged when a Japanese bomber collided with the ship on 21 October 1944. Captain Emile Dechaineux (white uniform, facing right), was among those killed Task Force 74 was absorbed on 11 October into Task Unit 77.3.2, assigned to provide close cover for the landing force in the operation to recapture Leyte, and departed that day for Hollandia.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 495, 500 At 15:30 on 13 October, Task Group 77.3 (including Australia and her companions) began the seven-day voyage to Leyte.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 501 At 09:00 on 20 October, Australia commenced shelling targets prior to the amphibious landings, then was positioned to provide gunfire support and attack targets of opportunity throughout the day.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 509‚Äì10 At around 06:00 on 21 October, Japanese aircraft attacked attempted to bomb the Allied ships in Leyte Bay.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 511 An Aichi D3A dive-bomber dove for Shropshire, but broke away after heavy anti- aircraft fire was directed at it. The Aichi, damaged by Bofors fire, turned and flew at low level up the port side of the nearby Australia, before striking the cruiser's foremast with its wingroot.Nichols, The first kamikaze attack? Although the bulk of the aircraft fell overboard, the bridge and forward superstructure were showered with debris and burning fuel. Seven officers (including Captain Dechaineux) and twenty-three sailors were killed by the collision, while another nine officers (including Commodore Collins), fifty-two sailors, and an AIF gunner were wounded.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 147 Observers aboard Australia and nearby Allied ships differed in their opinions of the collision; some thought that it was an accident, while the majority considered it to be a deliberate ramming aimed at the bridge. Following the attack, commander Harley C. Wright assumed temporary control of the ship.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 511‚Äì12 Although historian George Hermon Gill claims in the official war history of the RAN that Australia was the first Allied ship hit by a kamikaze attack, other sources, such as Samuel Eliot Morison in History of United States Naval Operations in World War II disagree as it was not a preplanned suicide attack (the first attack where the pilots were ordered to ram their targets occurred four days later), but was most likely performed on the pilot's own initiative, and similar attacks by damaged aircraft had occurred as early as 1942. Australia sailed for Kossol Passage on the afternoon of the attack, in company with and the US Ships (also damaged during the Leyte invasion) and .Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 513 On 24 October, the Australian ships proceeded to Manus, then sailed to Espiritu Santo for repairs. Work on Australia was completed by 28 November, and she rejoined the joint Australian- American task force (at that point operating under the designation 74.1) on 4 December.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pgs. 513, 536 Five days later, Farncomb, now a commodore, rejoined Australia to replace Collins.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 536 1945 Australia in January 1945 showing accumulated damage from kamikaze attacks At the start of 1945, Australia and the ships under her command were absorbed into Task Group 77.2, the escort and fire support force for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 579 Australia brought up the rear of the Task Group when it sailed from Leyte on the morning of 3 January, and was to be tasked with providing fire support for the landings at San Fabian. Numerous kamikaze attacks were attempted on the invasion force as it sailed to Lingayen Gulf; Australia was struck portside amidships at 17:35 on 5 January.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 582Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 192 25 were killed and 30 were wounded (officer casualties numbered 3 and 1 respectively), mostly from the gun crews of the port-side secondary and anti- aircraft guns, but the physical damage was not considered severe enough to withdraw her from the operation. The ships reached the gulf early on 6 January, and by 11:00, Australia had commenced pre-landing bombardment.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 583 A second kamikaze rammed the cruiser at 17:34 between the starboard 4-inch guns, killing 14 and wounding 26.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 584 The casualties again consisted primarily of gun crews, and after this point, there were only enough trained personnel to man one 4-inch gun on each side of the cruiser. Another aircraft attempted to ram Australia at 18:28, but this was shot down by , itself damaged by kamikaze strikes during the day, before it could strike.Morrison, The Two-Ocean War, p. 483 Australia, assigned to a counter-battery role, saw little activity during 7 January.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 585 The next day, she was attacked twice by kamikazes in quick succession: at 07:20, a twin-engine bomber hit the water from the cruiser and skidded to connect with the ship's port flank, then a second aircraft attacked at 07:39, again shot down just before it hit the port side at the waterline.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 586 A bomb carried by the second attacker opened a hole in the hull, causing a 5-degree list, but despite the explosion and a large quantity of debris and shrapnel, casualties were limited to a few cases of shock, and Australia was able to carry out the day's assigned bombardments. The landing force arrived on 9 January, and at 08:30, the cruiser began shelling targets in preparation for the amphibious assault.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 589 At 13:11, the fifth suicide aircraft to hit Australia during the operation struck; although it intended to take out the cruiser's bridge, the aircraft hit a mast strut and the forward exhaust funnel, and fell overboard.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 590 Although there were no casualties, the crash damaged the funnel, radar, and wireless systems, and the decision was made to withdraw the cruiser for repairs. Australia joined several Allied ships damaged by kamikaze strikes in escorting the transport ships back to Leyte on the evening of 9 January.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 591‚Äì2 Temporary repairs were made to the cruiser, and after Farncomb transferred his flag to so he could return to the main force, Australia sailed to Sydney via Manus for permanent repairs and a refit, arriving home on 28 January.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p. 592 Two days later, she docked at Cockatoo Island for repair and the preliminary stages of the refit, including the removal of 'X' turret and the aircraft catapult, and the shortening of the funnels by each. However, Australian shipyards had been instructed to prioritise repairs to British Pacific Fleet vessels, so Australia left the dock on 17 May and sailed on 24 May for England via the Panama Canal. The cruiser arrived at Plymouth on 2 July, and was docked for a major refit which ran from August to December.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 105 The ship received eight battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Atlantic 1940‚Äì41\\", \\"Pacific 1941‚Äì43\\", \\"Coral Sea 1942\\", \\"Savo Island 1942\\", \\"Guadalcanal 1942\\", \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì44\\", \\"Leyte Gulf 1944\\", and \\"Lingayen Gulf 1945\\".Royal Australian Navy, Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle HonoursRoyal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours According to naval historian John Bastock, Australia \\"probably fought more actions and steamed more miles than any other ship of the RAN\\" during the war. =Post- war= Australia in 1946 after post-war repairs The cruiser returned to Sydney on 16 February 1946, and she was placed into reserve for the rest of the year, during which the final components of the refit were completed. On 16 June 1947, Australia was recommissioned and designated flagship of the Australia Squadron. On 18 August, the cruiser sailed to Tokyo to serve with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. She remained in the region until the end of the year, and returned to Australia on 10 December. With the exceptions of visits to New Zealand in 1948 and New Guinea in 1949, Australia remained in home waters for the next three-and-a-half years. During 1949, the designation of Flagship was transferred to the light aircraft carrier . By the start of 1950, Australia had been reassigned to training duties. Australia visited New Zealand from 24 February to 31 March 1950. The cruiser was deployed on a 'mercy mission' to Heard Island in late July, to collect the island's doctor, who had developed appendicitis, and transport him to the mainland for treatment.RAN activities in the Southern Ocean, in Semaphore, p. 1 Given only 24 hours notice, the ship's company loaded provisions and cold-weather gear, while removing all unnecessary equipment to improve fuel consumption, before sailing on 27 July. Better-than-expected weather on the outbound voyage was countered by poor conditions at Heard Island, with Australia forced to loiter for a day before a boat could be safely launched to collect the doctor. The cruiser reached Fremantle on 14 August.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 25 Because of structural damage to Australia caused by Southern Ocean conditions, the Australian government announced that RAN vessels would not be deployed for similar incidents in the future, although the RAN performed three medical evacuations at the nearby Macquarie Islands in later years. Australia in October 1953 During May 1951, Australia transported Sir John Northcott, the Governor of New South Wales, to Lord Howe Island for jubilee celebrations. In July, the cruiser visited New Caledonia. During 1952, the cruiser visited New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands, and undertook a training cruise to New Zealand from mid September to 6 October. Australia made a port visit to New Zealand in October 1953. During February and March 1954, the cruiser served as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht Gothic, during the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation world tour. Later, in May, Australia transported Governor-General Sir William Slim, along with his wife and staff, on a cruise of the Coral Sea, Great Barrier Reef, and Whitsunday Passage. During this voyage, a disabled Dutch landing ship was located and towed to Cairns. Decommissioning and fate One of Australias 8-inch gun barrels on display outside the Australian War Memorial On 31 August 1954, Australia was paid off and marked for disposal. She had been in service for 26 years, the longest career of a RAN warship to that date.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 218 The ship was sold on 25 January 1955 to the British Iron & Steel Corporation for scrapping. On 26 March, the cruiser was towed from Sydney Harbour by the Dutch-flagged tugboat Rode Zee. The ships were later joined by two other tugs for the voyage to Barrow-in-Furness via the Suez Canal, where they arrived on 5 July. Australia was broken up at Thos W Ward's Shipbreaking Yard at Barrow- in-Furness over the course of 1956. One of the cruiser's 8-inch gun barrels is on display outside the Australian War Memorial. A memorial to the ship's company, particularly those killed during World War II, was unveiled at Henley Beach, South Australia on 1 May 2011.

History After the Polish Defense War of 1939, the German authorities of the General Government mobilized all the pre-war Polish policemen to the German service. The so- called Navy-Blue Police (Policja granatowa, nicknamed after the color of their uniforms) were used as an auxiliary unit of the Gestapo and Kripo, yet they had no means of executing law and order in the occupied country. At the same time, the German police forces and courts were more interested in persecution of Jews and members of the Polish intelligentsia and underground rather than common criminals. First underground, ad hoc courts were created alongside some of the first Polish resistance organizations as early as in 1939.Stanis≈Çaw Salmonowicz, Polskie Pa≈Ñstwo Podziemne, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, Warszawa, 1994, At first, they were purely military, concerned only with the cases that would fall under military law (such as treason). On April 16, 1940, the Polish Government in Exile in London decided that the underground Polish courts be created for prosecution of criminals, traitors, informants and collaborators. The structure and law regulating those courts were mostly finalized around 1942. The Special Courts tried only the pre-war citizens of Poland who were legally subjects of the Polish law. No citizens of other states (including members of the occupying forces of Germany and the USSR) were ever sentenced by the Special Courts. However, at times such claims were made by the Bureau of Information and Propaganda for propaganda reasons; nevertheless, executions of members of the SS and Gestapo were treated as elements of partisan warfare. The reason for such a policy was a belief that the Polish Underground State should act as if the occupation and dismemberment of Poland never happened. Polish special underground courts reviewed about 10,000 to 17,000 cases of collaboration, and sentenced over 3,500 individuals to death (2,500 executions were carried out; many others were sentenced to punishments like beatings or fines, or with a recommendation for review of the case after the war). Approximately 30% of the executions in Warsaw where on Poles found to blackmail or denounce the hiding Jews (szmalcowniks). Debate There is an ongoing debate whether the World War II Polish Special Courts were lawful and obeyed the elementary laws. According to the historians working for the Institute of National Remembrance the courts fulfilled the five basic conditions: #The courts operated in the name of the Polish State and were subject to both pre-war Polish law and the wartime legislation. #The courts penalized mostly the misdeeds included in the pre-war Polish law. Most of the trials were related either to high treason or collaboration. #There are no sources that would claim that the Special Courts sentenced anyone without sufficient evidence of guilt. #The Special Courts were always trying to reach the lawful verdict. 40% of all the judicial procedures ended up with the defendants found not guilty. Only 25% of the verdicts were for capital punishment, while the rest included the lash, infamy, banishment or fines. In many cases, the prosecution was suspended until the final liberation. #All of the procedures of the Polish law were obeyed. The only exception to that rule was the case of the so-called preemptive liquidation, when a person known for being a German spy or collaborator had to be executed before he could denounce the resistance network. However, some German historians claim that after 1939 Poland did not exist, and the execution of Polish law on German-held territory was therefore against international law. These claims remain controversial, since the annexation of Poland in 1939 was unilateral and acknowledged only by the Axis Powers and the USSR (which later declared its pact with Germany null and void). Moreover, the invasion was itself in violation of international law (German officials were later prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials for it), being an act of aggression (despite a German false flag attack that sought to show Polish provocation).

This resulted in all Iranian libraries being destroyed, books either being burnt or thrown into rivers. The only way that Iranians could protect these books was to bury them but many of the texts were forgotten over time. As soon as circumstances permitted, the Iranians wrote books and assembled libraries.

There remain a few literary works of the extinct Iranian language of Old Azeri that was used in Azerbaijan prior to the linguistic Turkification of the people of the region. Kurdish literature has also had a profound impact on the literature of Iran with it incorporating the various Kurdish dialects that are spoken throughout the Middle East.

Contemporary Iranian literature has been influenced by classical Persian poetry, but also reflects the particularities of modern-day Iran, through writers such as Houshang Moradi- Kermani, the most translated modern Iranian author, and poet Ahmad Shamlou.HOUSHMAND, Zara, \\"Iran\\", in Literature from the \\"Axis of Evil\\" (a Words Without Borders anthology), , 2006, pp.1-3 = Music = Iranian music has directly influenced the cultures of West Asia, Central Asia, Europe and South Asia. It has mainly influenced and built up much of the musical terminology of the neighboring Turkic and Arabic cultures, and reached India through the 16th-century Persianate Mughal Empire, whose court promoted new musical forms by bringing Iranian musicians. Iran is the place of origin of complex instruments, with the instruments dating back to the third millennium BC. A number of trumpets made of silver, gold, and copper were found in eastern Iran that are attributed to the Oxus civilization and date back between 2200 and 1750 BC. The use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps have been documented at the archaeological sites of Madaktu (650 BC) and Kul-e Fara (900‚Äì600 BC), with the largest collection of Elamite instruments documented at Kul-e Fara. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC. The reign of Sassanian ruler Khosrow II is regarded as a \\"golden age\\" for Iranian music. Sassanid music is where many the many music cultures of the world trace their distant origins to. The court of Khosrow II hosted a number of prominent musicians, including Azad, Bamshad, Barbad, Nagisa, Ramtin, and Sarkash. Among these attested names, Barbad is remembered in many documents and has been named as remarkably high skilled. He was a poet-musician who developed modal music, may have invented the lute and the musical tradition that was to transform into the forms of dastgah and maqam.\\"BƒÄRBAD\\". Encyclop√¶dia Iranica.

Dances from ancient artifacts, excavated at the archaeological pre-historic sites of Iran, portray a vibrant culture that mixes different forms of dances for all occasions. In conjunction with music, the artifacts depicted actors, dancers and ordinary people dancing in plays, dramas, celebrations, mourning and religious rituals with equipment such as costumes of animals or plants, masks and surrounding objects. As time progressed, this culture of dance began to develop and flourish. Iran is a multi-ethnic nation. Although the cultures of its ethnic groups are very similar and in most areas near identical, each has their own distinct and specific dance style. Iran possesses four categories of dance with these being: group dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and spiritual dances. Typically, the group dances are often unique and named after the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated with. These dances can be chain dances involving a group or the more common group dances mainly performed at festive occasions like weddings and Noruz celebrations which focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements. Solo dances are usually reconstructions of the historical and court dances of the various Iranian dynasties throughout history, with the most common types being that of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties due to them being relatively newer. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles. War or Combat dances, imitate combat or help to train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the Zurkhaneh (\\"House of Strength\\") and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called \\"Raghs-e-Pa\\" with the dances and actions done in the Zurkhaneh also resembling that of a martial art. Spiritual dances in Iran are known as \\"sama\\". There are various types of these spiritual dances which are used for spiritual purposes such as ridding the body of ill omens and evil spirits. These dances involve trance, music and complex movements. An example of such dance is that of the Balochi's called \\"le‚Äôb gowati\\", which is performed to rid a supposedly possessed person of the possessing spirit. In the Balochi language, the term \\"gowati\\" refers to psychologically ill patients who have recovered through music and dance.Oakling (May 2, 2003). \\"Bandari\\". everything2. Retrieved 3 July 2019 The earliest researched dances from Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra, the Zoroastrian angelic divinity of covenant, light, and oath, which was used commonly by the Roman Cult of Mithra. One of the cult's ceremonies involved the sacrifice of a bull followed by a dance that promoted vigor in life. The Cult of Mithra were active from the 1st Century CE to the 4th Century CE and worshiped a mystery religion inspired by the Iranian worship of Mithra. It was a rival of Christianity in the Roman Empire and was eventually suppressed in the 4th Century CE by Roman authorities in favor of Christianity.Hopfe, Lewis M.; Richardson, Henry Neil (September 1994). \\"Archaeological Indications on the Origins of Roman Mithraism\\".Martin, Luther H.; Beck, Roger (December 30, 2004). \\"Foreword\\". Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays. Ashgate Publishing. pp. xiii. . \\"However, the cult was vigorously opposed by Christian polemicists, especially by Justin and Tertullian, because of perceived similarities between it and early Christianity. And with the anti-pagan decrees of the Christian emperor Theodosius during the final decade of the fourth century, Mithraism disappeared from the history of religions as a viable religious practice.\\" This was done in order to counter the greater Iranian cultural influence that was expanding throughout the Roman empire. The cult was highly adhered and respected throughout the Roman Empire with it center in Rome, and was popular throughout the western half of the empire, as far south as Roman Africa and Numidia, as far north as Roman Britain, and to a lesser extent in Roman Syria in the east.Lewis M. Hopfe, \\"Archaeological indications on the origins of Roman Mithraism\\", in Lewis M. Hopfe (ed). Uncovering ancient stones: essays in memory of H. Neil Richardson, Eisenbrauns (1994), pp. 147‚Äì158. p. 156: \\"Beyond these three Mithraea [in Syria and Palestine], there are only a handful of objects from Syria that may be identified with Mithraism. Archaeological evidence of Mithraism in Syria is therefore in marked contrast to the abundance of Mithraea and materials that have been located in the rest of the Roman Empire. Both the frequency and the quality of Mithraic materials is greater in the rest of the empire. Even on the western frontier in Britain, archaeology has produced rich Mithraic materials, such as those found at Walbrook. If one accepts Cumont‚Äôs theory that Mithraism began in Iran, moved west through Babylon to Asia Minor, and then to Rome, one would expect that the cult left its traces in those locations. Instead, archaeology indicates that Roman Mithraism had its epicenter in Rome. Wherever its ultimate place of origin may have been, the fully developed religion known as Mithraism seems to have begun in Rome and been carried to Syria by soldiers and merchants. None of the Mithraic materials or temples in Roman Syria except the Commagene sculpture bears any date earlier than the late first or early second century. [footnote in cited text: 30. Mithras, identified with a Phrygian cap and the nimbus about his head, is depicted in colossal statuary erected by King Antiochus I of Commagene, 69‚Äì34 BCE. (see Vermaseren, CIMRM 1.53‚Äì56). However, there are no other literary or archaeological evidences to indicate that the religion of Mithras as it was known among the Romans in the second to fourth centuries AD was practiced in Commagene]. While little can be proved from silence, it seems that the relative lack of archaeological evidence from Roman Syria would argue against the traditional theories for the origins of Mithraism.\\"Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, pages 26 and 27 = Architecture = The history of Iranian architecture dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the South Caucasus and Zanzibar. Currently, there are 19 UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites that were designed and constructed by Iranians, with 11 of them being located outside of Iran. Iranian architecture displays a great variety of both structure and aesthetics and despite the repeated trauma of destructive invasions and cultural shocks, the Iranian zeal and identity has always triumphed and flourished. In turn, it has greatly influenced the architecture of its invaders from the Greeks to the Arabs to the Turks.Arthur Upham Pope. Introducing Persian Architecture. Oxford University Press. London. 1971.Arthur Upham Pope. Persian Architecture. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.266 The traditional theme of Iranian architecture is cosmic symbolism, which depicts the communication and participation of man with the powers of heaven. This theme has not only given continuity and longevity to the architecture of Iran, but has been a primary source of its emotional character of the nation as well. Iranian architecture ranges from simple structures to \\"some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen\\".Nader Ardalan and Laleh Bakhtiar. Sense of Unity; The Sufi Tradition in Persian Architecture. 2000. Iranian architectural style is the combination of intensity and simplicity to form immediacy, while ornament and, often, subtle proportions reward sustained observation. Iranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as the circle and square, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls. The paramount virtues of Iranian architecture are: \\"a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in vault and dome construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture\\".Arthur Upham Pope. Persian Architecture. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.10 The traditional architecture of Iran throughout the ages is categorized into 2 families and six following classes or styles. The two categories are Zoroastrian and Islamic, which references the eras of Pre-Islamic and Post-Islamic Iran, and the six styles, in order of their era, are: Parsian, Parthian Khorasani, Razi, Azari, Esfahani. The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 years of architectural development from the various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.Sabk Shenasi Mi'mari Irani (Study of styles in Iranian architecture), M. Karim Pirnia. 2005. In addition to historic gates, palaces, bridges, buildings and religious sites which highlight the highly developed supremacy of the Iranian art of architecture, Iranian gardens are also an example of Iran's comic symbolism and unique style of combining intensity and simplicity for form immediacy. There are currently 14 Iranian gardens that are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, with 5 of them being located outside of Iran.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372 \\"The Persian Garden\\" (1372) at World Heritage Site website The traditional style of Iranian gardens are to represent an earthly paradise or a heaven on Earth. From the time of the Achaemenid Empire, the idea of an earthly paradise spread through Iranian literature to other cultures, with the word for paradise in the Iranian languages of Avestan, Old Persian and Median, spreading to languages across the world.Fakour M., Achaemenid Gardens [1]; CAIS-Online - Accessed 4 July 2019 The style and design of the Iranian garden greatly influenced the garden styles of countries from Spain to Italy and Greece to India, with some notable examples of such gardens being the gardens of the Alhambra in Spain, Humayun's Tomb and the Taj Mahal in India, the Hellenistic gardens of the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemies in Alexandria. Religion in Iran Shah Mosque, Isfahan Zoroastrianism was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the Arab conquest. It has had an immense influence on Iranian philosophy, culture and art after the people of Iran converted to Islam.Shaul Shaked, From Zoroastrian Iran to Islam, 1995; and Henry Corbin, En Islam Iranien: Aspects spirituels et philosophiques (4 vols.), Gallimard, 1971-3. Today of the 98% of Muslims living in Iran, around 89% are Shi'a and only around 9% are Sunni. This is quite the opposite trend of the percentage distribution of Shi'a to Sunni Islam followers in the rest of the Muslim population from state to state (primarily in the Middle East) and throughout the rest of the world. Followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith form the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran. Bah√° º√≠s are scattered throughout small communities in Iran, although there seems to be a large population of Bah√° º√≠s in Tehran. The Iranian government actively pursues the persecution of Bah√° º√≠s. Followers of the Christian faith consist of around 250,000 Armenians, around 32,000 Assyrians, and a small number of Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant Iranians that have been converted by missionaries in earlier centuries. Thus, Christians that live in Iran are primarily descendants of indigenous Christians that were converted during the 19th and 20th centuries. Judaism is an officially recognized faith in Iran, and in spite of the hostilities between Iran and Israel over the Palestinian issue, the millennia- old Jewish community in Iran enjoys the right to practice their religion freely as well as a dedicated seat in parliament to a representative member of their faith. In addition to Christianity and Judaism, Zoroastrianism is another officially recognized religion in Iran, although followers of this faith do not hold a large population in Iran. In addition, although there have been isolated incidences of prejudice against Zoroastrians, most followers of this faith have not been persecuted for being followers of this faith. Holidays in Iran The Persian year begins in the vernal equinox: if the astronomical vernal equinox comes before noon, then the present day is the first day of the Persian year. If the equinox falls after noon, then the next day is the official first day of the Persian year. The Persian Calendar, which is the official calendar of Iran, is a solar calendar with a starting point that is the same as the Islamic calendar. According to the Iran Labor Code, Friday is the weekly day of rest. Government official working hours are from Saturday to Wednesday (from 8 am to 4 pm). Although the date of certain holidays in Iran are not exact (due to the calendar system they use, most of these holidays are around the same time), some of the major public holidays in Iran include Oil Nationalization Day (20 March), Nowrooz‚Äîwhich is the Iranian equivalent of New Years (20 March), the Prophet's Birthday and Imam Sadeq (4 June), and the Death of Imam Khomeini (5 June). Additional holidays include The Anniversary of the Uprising Against the Shah (30 January), Ashoura (11 February), Victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution (20 January), Sizdah- Bedar‚ÄîPublic Outing Day to end Nowrooz (1 April), and Islamic Republic Day (2 April). Wedding ceremonies There are two stages in a typical wedding ritual in Iran. Usually, both phases take place in one day. The first stage is known as \\"Aghd\\", which is basically the legal component of marriage in Iran. In this process, the bride and groom, as well as their respective guardians, sign a marriage contract. This phase usually takes place in the bride's home. After this legal process is over, the second phase, \\"Jashn-e Aroosi\\" takes place. In this step, which is basically the wedding reception, where actual feasts and celebrations are held, typically lasts from about 3‚Äì7 days. The ceremony takes place in a decorated room with flowers and a beautifully decorated spread on the floor. This spread is typically passed down from mother to daughter and is composed of very nice fabric such as \\"Termeh\\" (cashmere), \\"Atlas\\" (gold embroidered satin), or \\"Abrisham\\" (silk). Iranian Wedding Ceremony Items are placed on this spread: a Mirror (of fate), two Candelabras (representing the bride and groom and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy seeds, wild rice, angelica, salt, nigella seeds, black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play specific roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)‚Äîwhich helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) are placed on the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom's head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones‚Äîwhich are ground above the bride and groom's head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a cup of honey (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom's head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple's Holy Book (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God's blessing for the couple. An early age in marriage‚Äîespecially for brides‚Äîis a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran‚Äîeven though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age. Persian rugs In Iran, Persian rugs have always been a vital part of the Persian culture. Antique Persian Mashad Rug Iranians were some of the first people in history to weave carpets. First deriving from the notion of basic need, the Persian rug started out as a simple/pure weave of fabric that helped nomadic people living in ancient Iran stay warm from the cold, damp ground. As time progressed, the complexity and beauty of rugs increased to a point where rugs are now bought as decorative pieces. Because of the long history of fine silk and wool rug weaving in Iran, Persian rugs are world- renowned as some of the most beautiful, intricately designed rugs available. Around various places in Iran, rugs seem to be some of the most prized possessions of the local people. Iran currently produces more rugs and carpets than all other countries in the world put together. Modern culture =Cinema= With 300 international awards in the past 10 years, Iranian films continue to be celebrated worldwide. The best known Persian directors are Abbas Kiarostami, Majid Majidi, Jafar Panahi and Asghar Farhadi. =Contemporary art= There is a resurgence of interest in Iranian contemporary artists and in artists from the larger Iranian diaspora. Key notables include Shirin Aliabadi, Mohammed Ehsai, Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, Golnaz Fathi, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, Parastou Forouhar, Pouran Jinchi, Farhad Moshiri, Shirin Neshat, Parviz Tanavoli, Y. Z. Kami, and Charles Hossein Zenderoudi. =Music= Isfahan, Iran, dated 1669 =Architecture= Sassanian fortress in Derbent, Dagestan. Now inscribed on Russia's UNESCO world heritage list since 2003. =Cuisine= Cuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: nan and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called \\"tenurs\\"). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. One of the most popular of which includes yoghurt (\\"mast\\")‚Äîwhich has a specific fermentation process that is widely put to use amongst most Iranians. In addition, mast is used to make soup and is vital in the production of oil. In addition to these dairy products, Iranian cuisine involves a lot of dishes cooked from rice. Some popular rice dishes include boiled rice with a variety of ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and seasonings (\\"plov\\") including dishes like chelo-horesh, shish kebab with rice, chelo-kebab, rice with lamb, meatballs with rice, and kofte (plain boiled rice). In addition, Iranian cuisine is famous for its sweets. One of the most famous of which includes \\"baklava\\" with almonds, cardamom, and egg yolks. Iranian sweets typically involve the use of honey, cinnamon, lime juice, and sprouted wheat grain. One very popular dessert drink in Iran, \\"sherbet sharbat-portagal\\", is made from a mixture of orange peel and orange juice boiled in thin sugar syrup and diluted with rose water. Just like the people of many Middle Eastern countries the most preferred drink of the people of Iran is tea (without milk) or \\"kakhve- khana\\". Sports * The game of Polo originated with Iranian tribes in ancient times and was regularly seen throughout the country until the revolution of 1979 where it became associated with the monarchy. It continues to be played, but only in rural areas and discreetly. Recently, as of 2005, it has been acquiring an increasingly higher profile. In March 2006, there was a highly publicised tournament and all significant matches are now televised. * The Iranian Zoor Khaneh Women in Persian culture Since the 1979 Revolution, Iranian women have had more opportunities in some areas and more restrictions in others. One of the striking features of the Revolution was the large scale participation of women from traditional backgrounds in demonstrations leading up to the overthrow of the monarchy. The Iranian women who had gained confidence and higher education during the Pahlavi era participated in demonstrations against the Shah to topple the monarchy. The culture of education for women was established by the time of revolution so that even after the revolution, large numbers of women entered civil service and higher education, and in 1996 fourteen women were elected to the Islamic Consultative Assembly. In 2003, Iran's first woman judge during the Pahlavi era, Shirin Ebadi, won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in promoting human rights. According to a UNESCO world survey, at the primary level of enrollment Iran has the highest female to male ratio in the world among sovereign nations, with a female to male ratio of 1.22 : 1.00. By 1999, Iran had 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of books and magazines published by women.The Last Great Revolution by Robin Wright c2000, p.137 As of 2005, 65% of Iran's university students and 43% of its salaried workers were women.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006 (p.210) and as of early 2007 nearly 70% of Iran's science and engineering students are women. This has led to many female school and university graduates being under-utilized. This is beginning to have an effect on Iranian society and was a contributing factor to protests by Iranian youth. During recent decades, Iranian women have had significant presence in Iran's scientific movement, art movement, literary new wave and contemporary Iranian cinema. Women account for 60% of all students in the natural sciences, including one in five PhD students. Traditional holidays/celebrations Iranians celebrate the following days based on a solar calendar, in addition to important religious days of Islamic and Shia calendars, which are based on a lunar calendar. * Nowruz (Iranian New Year) - Starts from 21 March * Sizdah be dar (Nature Day) * Jashn-e-Tirgan (Water Festival) * Jashn-e-Sadeh (Fire Festival) * Jashn-e-Mehregan (Autumn Festival) * Shab-e-Yalda (Winter Feast) * Charshanbeh Suri Traditional cultural inheritors of the old Persia Georgia, 1620.

Like the Persian carpet that exhibits numerous colors and forms in a dazzling display of warmth and creativity, Persian culture is the glue that bonds the peoples of western and central Asia. The South Caucasus and Central Asia \\"occupy an important place in the historical geography of Persian civilization.‚Äù Much of the region was included in the Pre-Islamic Persian empires, and many of its ancient peoples either belonged to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European peoples (e.g. Medes and Soghdians), or were in close cultural contact with them (e.g. the Armenians).Edmund Herzing, Iran and the former Soviet South, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1995, p.48 In the words of Iranologist Richard Nelson Frye: : Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them. The Culture of Persia has thus developed over several thousand years. But historically, the peoples of what are now Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Eastern Georgia, and Afghanistan are related to one another as part of the larger group of peoples of the Greater Iranian cultural and historical sphere. The Northern Caucasus is well within the sphere of influence of Persian culture as well, as can be seen from the many remaining relics, ruins, and works of literature from that region.(e.g. 1) (e.g. 2) Image:Rahi moayeri tomb.jpgIran is filled with tombs of poets and musicians, such as this one belonging to Rahi Mo'ayeri.

Aquatic hydrophilids are notable for their long maxillary palps, which are longer than their antennae. Several of the former subfamilies of Hydrophilidae have recently been removed and elevated to family rank; Epimetopidae, Georissidae (= Georyssinae), Helophoridae, Hydrochidae, and Spercheidae (= Sphaeridiinae). Some of these formerly-included groups are primarily terrestrial or semi-aquatic. The vernacular name water scavenger beetles is not an accurate description of their habit. With rare exceptions, the larvae are predatory while the adults may be vegetarians or predators in addition to scavenging. Many species are able to produce sounds. Species of Hydrophilus are reported as pests in fish hatcheries. Other species are voracious consumers of mosquito larvae, and have potential as biological control agents. There are 2,835 species in 169 genera.Short & Fik√°ƒçek, 2011: 85, table 1 (see bibliography)  Geography  Hydrophilid beetles are found in various locations throughout the Western Hemisphere. They are usually found in areas of high humidity such as the tropics of Central and South America. They can also be found in rain pools and ponds in the forests of Guatemala and Argentina. They also tend to exist in North America in areas with seasonal wetlands or lakes depending on the state. Some hydrophilids are even found in areas of Europe. Hydrophilus triangularis is found widely throughout the United States and is the biggest water beetle in the country. Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Wyoming are the only US states where hydrophilids haven‚Äôt been found.  Evolutionary history  The oldest known fossils definitively assignable to the family are from the Late Jurassic Solnhofen of Germany and Talbragar Fish Bed in Australia.  Habitat  A majority of the beetles in the family Hydrophilidae live in aquatic environments in both their larval and adult life stages. Some hydrophilid beetles will lay their eggs in ephemeral ponds and puddles where the larvae will live as they develop. Other beetles such as Derralus angustus and Tropisternus setiger live in permanent ponds. Some beetles such as Tropisternus lateralis will only live in aquatic environments that lack fish because fish prey on their eggs, while others like D. angustus prefer aquatic habitats with a specific species of floating fern. Generally, hydrophilids live in marshy, shallow, and heavily weeded aquatic environments. There are some hydrophilid beetles that make their homes in fresh animal waste, decaying vegetation, or humus-rich soil. They survive in a very wide variety of locations and because of that some types are more adapted to specific environments than others and will often only move to habitats of the same type. The aquatic hydrophilids are less diverse than the terrestrial hydrophilids.  Physiology  Reproduction in hydrophilids takes place in bodies of water such as ponds. In the larval stage the beetle resides in a shallow area of the pond because they are dependent on the oxygen only available in the shallower areas. After the beetle exits the pupa stage they often take flight and move to a new area before they reproduce. Wing growth depends on the environment that the beetle resides in. Beetles in lentic habitats have better wing development compared to lotic habitats because lentic habitats are less reliable and require the beetles to disperse quicker in order to survive. Some beetles such as Berosus larvae can inhabit areas deeper in the water due to their thoracic gills while others like Berosus ingeminatus use cutaneous respiration allowing them to hold air for longer periods of time. The ability to consume oxygen at deeper water levels helps them avoid being preyed upon from surface predators. Adult hydrophilid beetles can survive in deeper areas of water and stay under for longer due to their special abilities in acquiring oxygen. They can hold air bubbles under their elytra that connect to their spiracles for them to use the trapped oxygen. They also have many fine hairs along their bodies that can trap oxygen. They can pull oxygen from the water into these areas on their body so that they can avoid returning to the surface for long periods of time. They only return to the surface when they need to replace the air they have acquired.  Reproduction  Some species of hydrophilid beetles in the genus Tropisternus have complex methods of signaling and communication including chirps, clicks, buzzing, and various body postures. These behaviors can assist in courtship. Courtship behaviors have been observed in Tropisternus ellipticus in which the females produced audible buzzing and shaking to rebuff potential suitors. In response to the rejection maneuvers of the female, male T. ellipticus will mimic the buzzing and shaking, often learning from repeated encounters of this kind to avoid females that produce these behaviors. Males may remember these encounters for up to 39 minutes when properly reinforced, which suggests that they have some capability for recording short-term memory. Typical courtship in these beetles consists of the following steps: 1\\\\. The male approaches the female, buzzing and swimming around her. 2\\\\. If the female is receptive, she will either chirp in response and move toward the male or remain still and silent. No rejection behavior occurs at this time. 3\\\\. The male approaches further and mounts the female. 4\\\\. The male will touch his maxillary palps to that of the female while producing a buzzing sound. 5\\\\. If the female does not rebuff his advances, the male with move to the back and probe the abdomen of the female with his aedeagus. 6\\\\. If she is receptive, the female must lower her abdomen for the male to penetrate. Males mount other beetles indiscriminately, and homosexual copulation has been known to occur. Anacaena lutescens, a species of hydrophilid beetle, has been observed as reproducing via parthenogenesis. Reproduction by parthenogenesis is relatively uncommon in other types of insects.  Life Stages  In Enochrus quadripunctatus, a species of hydrophilid beetle, it takes an average of 43 days for a newly hatched larva to reach its adult form. Juvenile mortality is high in this species, decreasing with each successive instar. Females will bury their silken egg case in the damp soil near a stream. Typically, the female will only create and lay one egg case per day, though they may create up to 20 egg cases in the weeks following a mating event and each case may produce from 1-32 individual larva. Females who have not mated will still create egg cases, but they will typically be empty or will not hatch at all. Not all egg cases laid by a mated female will hatch and produce viable offspring, but 42-70% will. Larval forms are carnivorous and may exhibit cannibalism among the individuals in a single egg case before hatching. The eggs begin to hatch an average of eight days after being laid. The egg hatches by way of the larvae eating their way out of the casing, usually by way of the lid. This process can take several days in some instances. Once the egg hatches, the first instar larvae will disperse, but will continue to feed on one another if the opportunity presents itself. They will remain in the first instar form for an average of 9.5 days before progressing to the second instar. Second instar individuals are much more robust, and voraciously feed on what meat they can find. They are strong swimmers at this stage and can be found at or beneath the surface of the stream. After an average of 11 days, they will transition to their third instar form. The third instar will last an average of 8.4 days, during which the larvae will continue feeding and become progressively slower as they reach their pupation stage. When they are ready to pupate, the larva will burrow into the sand where they will remain for 14 days before emerging as an adult. After vacating their burrow, the new adult will stand on the sand for up to 24 hours to allow its carapace to harden. Once fully hardened, the new fully grown adult beetle will travel to the water to hunt, where it will remain for the rest of its life. Although individuals of each species of hydrophilid (even those within the same genus) may vary in the duration of each of these life stages, mortality rates at each stage, and the number of offspring produced, few studies have been done to this effect on other species of hydrophilid.  Diet  Larval hydrophilids are predatory by nature and different species have different food consumption habits. The larvae usually ingest small invertebrates and snails but have been known to also eat small fish and tadpoles. Berosus ingeminatus prey mostly on Cricotopus sylvestris and other types of midges while Tropisternus setiger are tactile hunters and will eat whatever prey comes their way; they may even abandon a meal for a new one if the opportunity arises. The predatory habits of this species are often left behind in the larval stage. Generally adult hydrophilids feed on various vegetation, alive or decaying, and will occasionally eat dead animal tissue.  Predators  Hydrophilids have many predators from a range of different species. Fish, birds, predaceous insects, and turtles are the main predators in their aquatic environments. Humans have also been known to eat hydrophilid beetles.  Behavior  = Acoustic Behavior = The family hydrophilidae is a part of the larger genus Tropisternus which has been generally studied to perform acoustic sounds in their communicative behavior. Specifically, the water scavenger beetle has many calls including stress calls, a male courtship call, a male copulating sound, and a female rejection buzz. The sound production comes from the friction created by the beetle rubbing its spectrum (a well- defined ridge or lip) to its finely ridged surface called a pars stridens on the beetle's underside. = Predatory Behavior = Larval hydrophilids hunt a wide variety of prey such as copepods, mosquito larvae, snails, and conspecifics. The larvae have a unique way of hunting by lifting their prey out of the water to consume it. The reason for this is not well known, but there is a suggestion that lifting the prey makes it more difficult for the prey to escape. In addition to lifting their prey out of the water, hydrophilid larvae choose specific vegetation to wait in so that they may ambush their prey. In addition, the larvae often change ambush sites according to prey density. The frequency is directly correlated to the amount of prey in the ambush areas and specific attack sites.

She was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2005 who represented the downtown Toronto ridings of Riverdale and Toronto‚ÄîDanforth. She served as a cabinet minister in the Bob Rae government. In opposition she served as her party's critic for the Environment, Women's Issues and Democratic Renewal. She resigned from the legislature to run for the federal New Democratic Party. Churley was her party's candidate for the riding of Beaches‚ÄîEast York in 2006 and 2008, but was defeated both times. Background Churley was born in Old Perlican, Newfoundland in 1948. Her parents were Eddie Churley and Myrtis Emberley. Shortly after being born the family moved to Happy Valley, Labrador where her father worked as a cook at Goose Bay Air Force Base. She moved to the Downtown Toronto neighbourhood of Riverdale in 1978. She has served as a director of the Co-op Housing Federation of Toronto, and was a co-founder of the Bain Avenue Day Care Centre. Among other community commitments, Churley was also a director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Toronto. In 1968, she gave birth to a son, Billy, whom she gave up for adoption. She later reconnected with him in 1997. She also has a daughter, Astra, born in 1974. Churley's experience with adoption and the search for her son led her to advocate for adoption disclosure reform. Through the 1990s, she introduced several Private Member's Bills to facilitate the process of locating children given up for adoption. None of these passed. Subsequently, she was a strong supporter of a similar bill introduced by Sandra Pupatello. This bill later became the Adoption Information Disclosure Act. Politics =Municipal= Churley was elected to the Toronto City Council in 1988. She defeated longtime alderman Fred Beavis in the downtown riding of Riverdale. She was involved in a number of Toronto council initiatives, including the energy efficiency office, the \\"Clean Up the Don\\" movement (with fellow city councillors Jack Layton and Barbara Hall) and police patrols on bicycle. =In government= Churley was elected as a New Democrat in the riding of Riverdale in the provincial election of 1990. The NDP won a majority government in this election and she briefly serving as a Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of the Environment. On 18 March 1991, Churley was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations after the previous minister, Peter Kormos was fired by Bob Rae for a series of political blunders. Churley remained in this position throughout the Rae government's mandate. In cabinet, Churley opposed attempts to reduce social assistance to single mothers, and only accepted the introduction of casino gambling with reluctance. Toronto singer/songwriter Kurt Swinghammer wrote a song called \\"The Signature of Marilyn Churley\\", inspired by Churley's signature on an elevator license dating from her term in the Rae cabinet. =Cabinet positions= =In opposition= Rae's government lost the provincial election of 1995, and Churley was one of seventeen NDP members to retain a seat in the legislature. In opposition, she worked to force the government of Mike Harris to keep the Riverdale Hospital open, stopped the closure of 11 schools, and forced the government to cap tax increases for small business. She also served as Deputy Speaker of the legislature from October 1997 to October 1998. In the provincial election of 1999, she was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Broadview‚ÄîGreenwood. Churley became deputy leader of the NDP in 2001, following the retirement of Frances Lankin from the legislature. In the by-election to replace Lankin, the Liberals nominated Greenpeace co-founder and popular television personality Bob Hunter to run for them against former East York mayor Michael Prue for the NDP. During the race, Churley denounced Hunter for having written a novel with first-person accounts of encounters with child prostitutes in Bangkok. The Toronto Sun quoted Ms. Churley as saying: \\"It says something about Bob Hunter's character he could write such nasty, disgusting stuff about young girls in Thailand.\\" Hunter claimed that the story was written as satire, and sued both Churley and Prue for slander. The suit was withdrawn after the by- election, which Prue won. Churley was easily re-elected for a fourth term in 2003. After the election, when the NDP lost official party status in the Legislature, Churley threatened to legally change her surname to \\"Churley-NDP\\" so that the Speaker would be forced to say NDP when recognizing her in the House. A compromise was later reached which made this change unnecessary, and the party regained official status when Andrea Horwath won a 2004 by-election. Federal politics Churley was a prominent supporter of Jack Layton in his bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 2002. This position put her at odds with party leader Howard Hampton, who supported Bill Blaikie. In May 2005, Churley announced that once a federal election was called she would resign her Toronto‚ÄîDanforth seat at the provincial legislature and run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Since Toronto-Danforth is Layton's seat in the federal parliament, Churley sought to represent the neighbouring riding of Beaches‚ÄîEast York. However, Churley could not overcome accusations of being a parachute candidate, despite living only a few miles away from the Beaches‚ÄîEast York riding, and was defeated in the January 23, 2006 election by incumbent Liberal Maria Minna in a hard fought contest. On February 9, 2007, at a fundraiser in Toronto, Churley clarified that she would be seeking the nomination in Beaches‚ÄîEast York for a potential federal election in 2007. Two months later, Churley was renominated as the NDP candidate in that riding. She was again defeated by Maria Minna in the 2008 election.

Its body is soft and flattened, the anterior dorsal portion has a pair of retractable rhinophores and the posterior part has six contractile gills inserted independently in the body. The pair of oral tentacles are constituted by a fin flexible membrane provided with large digital lobes. In a normal situation when the animal is crawling, the edges of its mantle are curled upwards creating a peripheral blister. If the animal is disturbed, it unfolds its edges and can swim through contractions and undulations of the body to move away from the disturbing element. Its common name, Spanish dancer, comes from this particular defense. Juveniles are rather whitish to yellowish with multiple purplish points and orange rhinophores and gills.

It likes rocky and coral reefs with many sponges and shelters from 1 to 50 meters deep. Biology During daytime, the Spanish dancer hides away from the light in the crevices of its natural habitat to only come out late at night. It feeds on various species of sponge. Like all nudibranchs, it is hermaphrodite and its bright red to pink egg ribbon has a spiral shape related to the size of the animal so relatively large. The latter is coveted by some other species of nudibranch as Favorinus tsuruganus or Favorinus japonicus.

Farewell Spit is a narrow sand spit at the northern end of the Golden Bay, South Island of New Zealand. Known to the MƒÅori as Tuhuroa, it runs eastwards from Cape Farewell, the island's northernmost point. It is located about 50 kilometres north of Takaka and 20 kilometres from Collingwood. The tiny settlement of Puponga stands close to the western (landward) end of the spit. It forms the northern side of Golden Bay and is the longest sandspit in New Zealand, stretching for about 26 km above sea level and another 6 km underwater. The spit runs in from west to east, and is made from fine golden sand ‚Äì as Cape Farewell to the west of the spit is mostly composed of late Cretaceous quartz sandstones, i.e. silica but with traces of other heavy minerals, garnet, ilmenite, magnetite and pyroxene. The erosion of the cliffs into fine sand carried on the sea currents creates Farewell spit further east.Farewell Spit and Cape Farewell (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand) The northern side of the dunes are steeper and unstable being constantly exposed to the prevailing winds which average over 25 km/h. The southern side which faces Golden Bay is more stable and largely covered with vegetation. The tide here can recede as much as seven kilometres exposing some 80 square kilometres of mud flats; a rich feeding ground for the many seabirds in the area but also a trap for frequently stranded whales. Human use The automated lighthouse at the end of Farewell Spit. Abel Tasman in 1642 was the first European to see the spit, calling it Sand Duining Hoeck. Captain James Cook was the next European visitor in 1770, showing Farewell Spit as a broad peninsula on his maps. He named close by Cape Farewell, and the name stuck, with early European settlers originally calling the sandbanks 'Cape Farewell Spit' before it was shortened to its present name. It was the last land he sighted after leaving New Zealand for Australia at the end of his first voyage. The lighthouse at the end of the spit was first lit on 17 June 1870 in response to many ships having been wrecked upon the spit. The original timber tower did not stand up well to the frequent blasting by the sand and salt-laden winds experienced at the end of the spit. The hardwood used started to decay rapidly and the original tower was replaced in 1897 by the present structure, the only steel latticework lighthouse in New Zealand. Due to the spit only reaching above sea level at this point, the lighthouse has to be taller than usual for New Zealand's coast. The light of the tall tower can be seen for . The original oil-burning lamp was converted to a 1000 watt electric lamp in 1954, and the diesel power supply replaced by a buried mains electricity cable along the spit in 1966. The original lamp was changed to a modern rotation beacon with a 50 tungsten halogen bulb in 1999.Information panel at the lighthouse keeper's house, Maritime New Zealand The light was fully automated and the last lighthouse keeper was withdrawn in 1984. The lighthouse keeper's house and two accommodation buildings are still being maintained for use by the Department of Conservation, Maritime New Zealand, and tour groups. The spit is administered by the New Zealand Department of Conservation as a seabird and wild life reserve. Apart from a small area at the base of the Spit it is closed to the public except through organised tours. Four-wheel drive bus tours from Collingwood or Puponga include the opportunity to jump off a sand dune, a visit to the lighthouse and the gannet colony. The south side of Farewell Spit is home to many thousands of seabirds; it also the site of frequent whale strandings mainly by long- finned pilot whales. The northern side is bounded by the Tasman Sea. Shipwrecks The ran aground off Farewell Spit in 1877'Wreck of the Queen Bee, from London', pg 2, Nelson Evening Mail, 8 August 1877 and the was sunk by a mine 17 km off the spit in 1917. The dredge Manchester was last seen off the Farewell Spit in April 1912 and was said to have foundered in the Tasman Sea between 6 and 9 April, with the loss of 25 lives. Whale stranding Volunteers attempt to keep body temperatures of beached pilot whales from rising at Farewell Spit Whale strandings have been a common occurrence throughout history on Farewell Spit.Melissa Hogenboom Do whales have graveyards where they prefer to die? BBC 2015/02/25 On 15 November 2012, a pod of pilot whales stranded themselves on the spit, around two kilometres north- east from the Spit Cafe. Eleven were found dead on the first day. The spit has claimed around 680 Whales since records began. In January 2014 several whales stranded and re-stranded. This included a pod of 50 pilot whales, many of whom died from stress or needed to be euthanised despite several attempts to refloat them. In February 2015, pilot whales were found stranded on Farewell Spit. On 10 February 2017 a pod of 416 pilot whales beached overnight at Farewell Spit. 75% of the whales were dead upon the arrival of a Project Jonah medical rescue team and attempts were undertaken to refloat the remaining live whales at the morning high tide. Efforts are underway, but 240 more arrived on Saturday.

A CMTS provides many of the same functions provided by the DSLAM in a DSL system. Connections In order to provide high speed data services, a cable company will connect its headend to the Internet via very high capacity data links to a network service provider. On the subscriber side of the headend, the CMTS enables the communication with subscribers' cable modems. Different CMTSs are capable of serving different cable modem population sizes‚Äîranging from 4,000 cable modems to 150,000 or more, depending in part on traffic. A given headend may have between 1-12 CMTSs to service the cable modem population served by that headend or HFC hub. One way to think of a CMTS is to imagine a router with Ethernet interfaces (connections) on one side and coaxial cable RF interfaces on the other side. The RF/coax interfaces carry RF signals to and from the subscriber's cable modem. In fact, most CMTSs have both Ethernet interfaces (or other more traditional high-speed data interfaces like SONET) as well as RF interfaces. In this way, traffic that is coming from the Internet can be routed (or bridged) through the Ethernet interface, through the CMTS and then onto the RF interfaces that are connected to the cable company's hybrid fiber coax (HFC). The traffic winds its way through the HFC to end up at the cable modem in the subscriber's home. Traffic from a subscriber's home system goes through the cable modem and out to the Internet in the opposite direction. CMTSs typically carry only IP traffic. Traffic destined for the cable modem from the Internet, known as downstream traffic, is carried in IP packets encapsulated according to DOCSIS standard. These packets are carried on data streams that are typically modulated onto a TV channel using either 64-QAM or 256-QAM versions of quadrature amplitude modulation. Upstream data (data from cable modems to the headend or Internet) is carried in Ethernet frames encapsulated inside DOCSIS frames modulated with QPSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM or 128-QAM using TDMA, ATDMA or S-CDMA frequency sharing mechanisms. This is done at the \\"subband\\" or \\"return\\" portion of the cable TV spectrum (also known as the \\"T\\" channels), a much lower part of the frequency spectrum than the downstream signal, usually 5 - 42 MHz in DOCSIS 2.0 or 5 - 60 MHz in EuroDOCSIS. A typical CMTS allows a subscriber's computer to obtain an IP address by forwarding DHCP requests to the relevant servers. This DHCP server returns, for the most part, what looks like a typical response including an assigned IP address for the computer, gateway/router addresses to use, DNS servers, etc. The CMTS may also implement some basic filtering to protect against unauthorized users and various attacks. Traffic shaping is sometimes performed to prioritize application traffic, perhaps based upon subscribed plan or download usage and also to provide guaranteed Quality of service (QoS) for the cable operator's own PacketCable-based VOIP service. However, the function of traffic shaping is more likely done by a Cable Modem or policy traffic switch. A CMTS may also act as a bridge or router. A customer's cable modem cannot communicate directly with other modems on the line. In general, cable modem traffic is routed to other cable modems or to the Internet through a series of CMTSs and traditional routers. However, a route could conceivably pass through a single CMTS. Architectures A CMTS can be broken down into two different architectures, Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS) or Modular (M-CMTS). There are both pros and cons to each type of architecture. =Modular CMTS (M-CMTS)= In an M-CMTS solution the architecture is broken up into two components. The first part is the Physical Downstream component (PHY) which is known as the Edge QAM (EQAM). The second part is the IP networking and DOCSIS MAC Component which is referred to as the M-CMTS Core. There are also several new protocols and components introduced with this type of architecture. One is the DOCSIS Timing Interface, which provides a reference frequency between the EQAM and M-CMTS Core via a DTI Server. The second is the Downstream External PHY Interface (DEPI). The DEPI protocol controls the delivery of DOCSIS frames from the M-CMTS Core to the EQAM devices Some of the challenges that entail an M-CMTS platform are increased complexity in RF combining and an increase in the number of failure points. One of the benefits of an M-CMTS architecture is that it is extremely scalable to larger numbers of downstream channels.

Solitaire, (usually) played by one, Lucky Seven may be played by any number of players. Seven has long been regarded as a number of perfection, luck, and wonder. The game was designed by Martin H. SamuelMartin H. Samuel when in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Simple though the game may be, the game mechanic is a mathematical formula known as a strange loop. Great American Puzzle Factory, Inc. of South Norwalk, Connecticut, United States, published the game in 2003. Family Games, Inc. of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, published their variation of the game in 2015. Components *Seven coasters numbered 1 through 7 *Instructions Objective The goal of the game is, to turn all seven coasters number side up to accrue the most points. Game Lucky Seven is played with seven numbered coasters (per player) on a flat surface. If more than one player; the coasters are shuffled, players each choose a coaster and the player with the highest number starts. The coasters are shuffled and laid in a row number-side down; the player turns over any coaster and leaves it in place number-side up. The exposed number on the coaster determines the POSITION (always reading from left to right from POSITION one) of the next coaster to be turned over ... and so on. The player keeps going to see if all coasters can be turned over. If the player turns over a coaster with a number denoting the POSITION of one already turned; he or she is \\"bust\\" and the coasters are then shuffled and passed to the next player ... (or start again if playing solo). Each player may have a set of Lucky Seven coasters and all play simultaneously. Players keep their own score throughout the game, which may be played for; each hand, a certain number of hands or to an agreed points total. When the game is over, by comparing accrued points totals, the player with the most points is the winner.

Prue was mayor of East York, Ontario from 1993 to 1997 and subsequently represented the riding of Beaches‚ÄîEast York in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2001 to 2014 as member of the New Democratic Party (NDP)'s Queen's Park caucus. He was a candidate in the 2009 Ontario NDP leadership election, finishing in fourth place. In 2018, he was elected to the town council of Amherstburg, Ontario where he now lives.https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/dicarlo-re-elected-amherstburg- mayor-calls-it-referendum-on-his-agenda Background Prue grew up in Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Anthropology from the University of Toronto, and a Master of Arts degree in Canadian Studies from Carleton University. After graduation, he worked as counsel for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. During his time as a federal government employee, Prue was an activist in the Canada Employment & Immigration Union, a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. Politics =Early political career= In the 1980 federal election, Prue ran as a federal NDP candidate in Scarborough Centre and received 9237 votes for a third-place finish. He ran in the same riding in the 1984 election, again placing third. =Municipal politics and mayoralty= Prue became a councillor in East York in 1988. In 1993 he was appointed mayor of the borough. The previous mayor David Johnson resigned when he won a provincial by-election. Rather than pay for the expense of a mayoral campaign, the East York council decided to choose a candidate from amongst themselves. Prue won the position after five ballots. The next year, he was elected mayor in the 1994 municipal election and remained in the position until 1997, when East York and the other component municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged into the single municipality of the city of Toronto. During his tenure as mayor, Prue brought in five consecutive budgets without a tax increase, while cutting East York's debt by $7.8 million. Before the 1998 municipal election, Prue successfully lobbied the provincial government to allot a third council seat for East York to improve its representation on Toronto City Council. Following amalgamation, Prue was elected to represent Ward 32 on Toronto City Council. =Provincial politics= On September 20, 2001 Prue won a by-election to replace retiring NDP MPP Frances Lankin in the Ontario legislature. There was some controversy during the by-election. Liberal candidate Bob Hunter accused the NDP of smearing his reputation. He accused Prue of calling him a pedophile based on a book he wrote in 1988. Pages of the book, which portrayed sexual encounters with young prostitutes, were faxed to journalists during the campaign. Hunter launched a libel lawsuit against Prue and NDP leader Howard Hampton but dropped the suit after the election. Prue won the by-election with 50% of the vote while Hunter received 36%. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2011, with large pluralities. In 2002 Prue undertook a week-long \\"welfare diet\\", trying to live on $12.05 for an entire week to draw attention to the condition of Ontario's poorest residents under the Mike Harris government. In 2004 during a debate over expenses charged by school trustees, Prue said that city councillors could do much of the work of trustees. He appeared to support combining the two roles. In 2007 he supported a push for more accountability for executive compensation packages. In May, 2007, he tabled a private member's bill called the Conrad Black Executive Compensation Abuse Act which sought to have pay packages put to binding shareholder votes. He has also championed affordable housing in Toronto, =2009 leadership convention= On July 18, 2008, Prue announced his intention to seek the leadership of the Ontario NDP at its 2009 leadership convention. At a press conference to announce his bid to replace Howard Hampton as leader of the Ontario NDP party, Prue made remarks on public funding for Catholic schools in Ontario. \\"The NDP policy is there, it says that we support the dual system,\\" he said. \\"It is time though, I think, that we take a look at that, but we need to leave that to [the] convention. It cannot be my position or an individual's position... rather it must be a party position and we must have an open and frank debate to get to that point.\\" He insisted he wasn't trying to reopen the debate about religion and schools. Prue received 11.5% of the votes (weighted) on the first ballot, finishing in fourth place. According to the rules of the contest, as the last place finisher he was dropped off the next ballot. Prue gave his personal endorsement to Gilles Bisson who finished in third place on the first ballot with 23.7% of the weighted vote. After Bisson was eliminated on the next ballot, Prue endorsed Andrea Horwath, who won the leadership on the third ballot with 60.4% over rival Peter Tabuns. Prue reported raising $79,411.74 for his leadership bid, the lowest of the four contestants. His expenses were the second highest at $222,320.94. His reported deficit was $142,909.20, the highest of the four contestants. =Subsequent career= Prue was narrowly defeated by Liberal candidate Arthur Potts in the 2014 provincial election. He lost by 431 votes. After Queen's Park Following his defeat in 2014, Prue and his wife decided to sell their house in Toronto in order to fund their retirement in a smaller town, moving to Amherstburg, outside of Windsor, Ontario.https://windsorstar.com/opinion/columnists/henderson-essex-county-is- ontarios-best-kept-secret After sitting on the town's committee of adjustment, Prue was elected to town council in 2018.

According to Kolesnikov, this combination cannot be formed in the natural world and thus the SARS virus must have been produced under laboratory conditions. Another Russian scientist, Nikolai Filatov, head of Moscow's epidemiological services, had earlier commented that the SARS virus was probably man-made. However, independent labs concluded these claims to be premature since the SARS virus is a coronavirus, whereas measles and mumps are paramyxoviruses. The primary differences between a coronavirus and a paramyxovirus are in their structures and method of infection, thus making it implausible for a coronavirus to have been created from two paramyxoviruses. The widespread reporting of claims by Kolesnokov and Filatov caused controversy in many Chinese internet discussion boards and chat rooms. Many Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat. The failure to find the source of the SARS virus further convinced these people and many more that SARS was artificially synthesised and spread by some individuals and even governments. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the SARS virus crossed over to humans from Asian palm civets (\\"civet cats\\"), a type of animal that is often killed and eaten in Guangdong, where SARS was first discovered. Supporters of the conspiracy theory suggest that SARS caused the most serious harm in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, regions where most Chinese reside, while the United States, Europe and Japan were not affected as much. However, the highest mortality from SARS outside of China occurred in Canada where 43 died. Conspiracists further point out that SARS has an average mortality rate of around 10% around the world, but no one died in the United States from SARS, despite the fact that there were 8 confirmed cases out of 27 probable cases (10% of 8 people is less than 1 person). Regarding reasons why SARS patients in the United States experienced a relatively mild illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has explained that anybody with fever and a respiratory symptom who had traveled to an affected area was included as a SARS patient in the U.S., even though many of these were found to have had other respiratory illnesses. Tony Zeng, an activist with no medical background, authored the book The Last Defense Line: Concerns About the Loss of Chinese Genes, published in 2003. In the book, Zeng suggested researchers from the United States may have created SARS as an anti-Chinese bioweapon after taking blood samples in China for a longevity study in the 1990s. The book's hypothesis was a front-page report in the Guangzhou newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily. (also see ) Coronaviruses similar to SARS have been found in bats in China, suggesting they may be their natural reservoir.

It consists of a strong bladder (or plastic bag), usually made of several layers of metallised film or other plastics, seated inside a corrugated fiberboard box. The bag is supplied to the company which will fill it as an empty pre-made bag. The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with wine, juice or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box. The bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use, there are a number of options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from chilled product temperatures up to . BiB packaging can be made using form seal fill (FSF) technology, where the bags are manufactured on-line from reels of film, then the FlexTap is inserted then filled on an integral rotary head filler. The BiB is currently used to package wine, soda fountain syrup products, milk, liquid chemicals, and water. History The first commercial BiB system was invented by American chemist William R. Scholle in 1955 for the safe transportation and dispensing of battery acid. Scholle's invention inspired a \\"packaging revolution.\\" In 1991, Scholle was inducted into the packaging hall of fame for his invention.Packaging Hall of Fame Uses BiB has many common commercial applications. One of the most common commercial uses is to supply syrup to soft drink fountains and to dispense bulk supplied condiments such as ketchup or mustard in the foodservice industry specifically in fast food outlets. BiB technology is still used for its original application of dispensing sulfuric acid for filling lead-acid batteries in garages and dealerships. As explained further below, BiBs have also been implemented for consumer applications like boxed wine. For commercial syrup applications, the customer opens one end of the box (sometimes via a pre-scored opening) and connects a compatible connector to fitment on the bag to pump out its contents. The fitment itself contains a one-way valve which opens only with pressure from the attached connector and which prevents contamination of the syrup in the bag. For consumer applications like boxed wine, there is a tap already present on the bag, so all the consumer has to do is locate the tap on the outside of the box. Advantages Producers like BiB packaging because it is inexpensive. BiB also offers environmental benefits by allowing contents of 1.5‚Äì1000 liters, so that less packaging or labeling is required. The material it is made from is lighter than the other plastic alternatives, providing it with a better carbon footprint. Wine cask A 4-litre cask of Australian white wine The 'wine cask' was invented by Thomas Angove (1918‚Äì2010) of Angove's, a winemaker from Renmark, South Australia, and patented by the company on April 20, 1965. Polyethelene bladders of 1 gallon (4.5 litres) were put into corrugated boxes for sale to consumers. An original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder inside the box, pour out the desired quantity of wine and then reseal it with a special peg. In 1967, Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight tap welded into an aluminised film bladder, making storage much more convenient for consumers. All modern wine casks now utilise some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box. The main advantage of BiB packaging is that it prevents oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Rather than working as a conventional tap, the bladder uses gravity pressure to squeeze the liquid out of the bladder, whereas a conventional barrel tap works by allowing incoming air to displace the contents. After opening wine in a bottle, it is oxidized by air in the bottle which has displaced the wine poured; wine in a bag is not touched by air and thus not subject to oxidation until it is dispensed. Cask wine is not subject to cork taint or spoilage due to slow consumption after opening. Although a promising technology, there have been production and design problems. The impermeable bladders tend to delaminate around the tap and where the two halves are joined. If tap components are deposited in the bladder during assembly, all the bladders must be destroyed to find the components as the bladders are opaque. It has also been difficult to manufacture taps that do not leak air into the bladder since tap parts usually do not join neatly, although there have been significant improvements. Most red wines require breathing before consumption which is not possible with casks, so the wine has air circulated through it before bottling (usually by running through a centrifuge), which reduces shelf life considerably. Most casks will have a best-before date stamped. As a result, it is not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the prescribed period. Aseptic packaging BiB is also used extensively in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using aseptic packaging equipment, products can be packed in aseptic packaging. Pasteurized or UHT treated products packed into this format can be \\"shelf-stable\\", requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years, depending on the type of bag that is used. The key to this unique system is that the product being filled is not exposed to the external environment at any stage during the process and as such, there is no possibility of a bacterial load being added to the product during the filling process. To ensure there is no contamination from the packaging, the bag is irradiated after the bag manufacturing process. These packs are typically from 10 to 1200 liters and offer the advantage of cheap, disposable and transport efficient packaging. See also *Corrugated box design *Tetra Brik Notes References *Yam, K.

He wrote the \\"Eating Out\\" column for The Wall Street Journal's weekend edition from 2006 until March 2010. Early life and education Sokolov grew up in the U.S. city of Detroit, and, while still in elementary school, finished 26th then 2nd in consecutive years in the National Spelling Bee in 1952 and 1953. He attended secondary school at Cranbrook, in suburban Detroit (Bloomfield Hills), whence he graduated in 1959. After graduating from Harvard College summa cum laude in classics, and spending a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Wadham College, Oxford, Sokolov spent two years back at Harvard pursuing a doctorate in classics. In 1965 he passed his orals. Career In 1965, Sokolov began work as foreign correspondent for Newsweek Magazine in its Paris bureau. In summer 1967, he returned to the U.S. with Newsweek as an arts writer. In 1971, he became restaurant critic and food editor of the New York Times, where his pieces covered the decor, lore, and politics of New York restaurants as well as the productions of their kitchens. His reviews first noted the arrival of Sichuanese and Hunanese food in North America. He was the first writer in English to notice nouvelle cuisine in France. In 1975 he left the Times to pursue a career as a freelance writer from his home in Brooklyn Heights.

Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are microbicidal, while those that merely inhibit their growth are called biostatic. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is known as antimicrobial prophylaxis. The main classes of antimicrobial agents are disinfectants (non- selective agents, such as bleach), which kill a wide range of microbes on non- living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, antiseptics (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and antibiotics (which destroy microorganisms within the body). The term \\"antibiotic\\" originally described only those formulations derived from living microorganisms but is now also applied to synthetic agents, such as sulfonamides or fluoroquinolones. The term also used to be restricted to antibacterials (and is often used as a synonym for them by medical professionals and in medical literature), but its context has broadened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further subdivided into bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents, which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go beyond simply inhibiting microbial growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been developed to kill microbes on contact. History Antimicrobial use has been common practice for at least 2000 years. Ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks used specific molds and plant extracts to treat infection. In the 19th century, microbiologists such as Louis Pasteur and Jules Francois Joubert observed antagonism between some bacteria and discussed the merits of controlling these interactions in medicine. Louis Pasteur's work in fermentation and spontaneous generation led to the distinction between anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The information garnered by Pasteur led Joseph Lister to incorporate antiseptic methods, such as sterilizing surgical tools and debriding wounds into surgical procedures. The implementation of these antiseptic techniques drastically reduced the number of infections and subsequent deaths associated with surgical procedures. Louis Pasteur's work within in microbiology also led to the development of many vaccines for life- threatening diseases such as anthrax and rabies. On September 3, 1928, Alexander Fleming returned from a vacation and discovered that a Petri dish filled with Staphylococcus was separated into colonies due to the antimicrobial fungus Penicillium rubens. Fleming and his associates struggled to isolate the antimicrobial but referenced its therapeutic potential in 1929 in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology. In 1942, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Edward Abraham utilized Fleming's work to purify and extract penicillin for medicinal uses earning them the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Chemical Selman Waksman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for developing 22 antibiotics‚Äîmost notably Streptomycin =Antibacterials= Antibacterials are used to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are classified generally as beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines or aminoglycosides. Their classification within these categories depends on their antimicrobial spectra, pharmacodynamics, and chemical composition. Prolonged use of certain antibacterials can decrease the number of enteric bacteria, which may have a negative impact on health. Consumption of probiotics and reasonable eating may help to replace destroyed gut flora. Stool transplants may be considered for patients who are having difficulty recovering from prolonged antibiotic treatment, as for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections. The discovery, development and use of antibacterials during the 20th century have reduced mortality from bacterial infections. The antibiotic era began with the pneumatic application of nitroglycerine drugs, followed by a \\"golden\\" period of discovery from about 1945 to 1970, when a number of structurally diverse and highly effective agents were discovered and developed. Since 1980, the introduction of new antimicrobial agents for clinical use has declined, in part because of the enormous expense of developing and testing new drugs. In parallel, there has been an alarming increase in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria, fungi, parasites and some viruses to multiple existing agents. Antibacterials are among the most commonly used drugs and among the drugs commonly misused by physicians, for example, in viral respiratory tract infections. As a consequence of widespread and injudicious use of antibacterials, there has been an accelerated emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, resulting in a serious threat to global public health. The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria resistant to current antibacterials. Possible strategies towards this objective include increased sampling from diverse environments and application of metagenomics to identify bioactive compounds produced by currently unknown and uncultured microorganisms as well as the development of small-molecule libraries customized for bacterial targets. =Antifungals= Antifungals are used to kill or prevent further growth of fungi. In medicine, they are used as a treatment for infections such as athlete's foot, ringworm and thrush and work by exploiting differences between mammalian and fungal cells. Unlike bacteria, both fungi and humans are eukaryotes. Thus, fungal and human cells are similar at the molecular level, making it more difficult to find a target for an antifungal drug to attack that does not also exist in the host organism. Consequently, there are often side effects to some of these drugs. Some of these side effects can be life-threatening if the drug is not used properly. As well as their use in medicine, antifungals are frequently sought after to control indoor mold in damp or wet home materials. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) blasted on to surfaces acts as an antifungal. Another antifungal solution applied after or without blasting by soda is a mix of hydrogen peroxide and a thin surface coating that neutralizes mold and encapsulates the surface to prevent spore release. Some paints are also manufactured with an added antifungal agent for use in high humidity areas such as bathrooms or kitchens. Other antifungal surface treatments typically contain variants of metals known to suppress mold growth e.g. pigments or solutions containing copper, silver or zinc. These solutions are not usually available to the general public because of their toxicity. =Antivirals= Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infections. Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. They should be distinguished from viricides, which actively deactivate virus particles outside the body. Many antiviral drugs are designed to treat infections by retroviruses, including HIV. Important antiretroviral drugs include the class of protease inhibitors. Herpes viruses, best known for causing cold sores and genital herpes, are usually treated with the nucleoside analogue acyclovir. Viral hepatitis is caused by five unrelated hepatotropic viruses (A-E) and may be treated with antiviral drugs depending on the type of infection. Some influenza A and B viruses have become resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, and the search for new substances continues. =Antiparasitics= Antiparasitics are a class of medications indicated for the treatment of infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis, malaria and Chagas disease, which are caused by parasites such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes and infectious protozoa. Antiparasitic medications include metronidazole, iodoquinol and albendazole. Like all therapeutic antimicrobials, they must kill the infecting organism without serious damage to the host. = Broad- spectrum Therapeutics = Broad-spectrum therapeutics are active against multiple classes of pathogens. Such therapeutics have been suggested as potential emergency treatments for pandemics. Azithromycin is currently the only identified broad-spectrum therapeutic. =Non-pharmaceutical= A wide range of chemical and natural compounds are used as antimicrobials. Organic acids and their salts are used widely in food products, e.g. lactic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, either as ingredients or as disinfectants. For example, beef carcasses often are sprayed with acids, and then rinsed or steamed, to reduce the prevalence of Escherichia coli. Copper-alloy surfaces have natural intrinsic antimicrobial properties and can kill microorganisms such as E. coli and Staphylococcus. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has approved the registration of 355 such antibacterial copper alloys. In addition to regular cleaning, antimicrobial copper alloys are being installed in some healthcare facilities and subway transit systems as a public hygienic measure. Other heavy metal cations such as Hg2+ and Pb2+ have antimicrobial activities, but can be toxic. Traditional herbalists used plants to treat infectious disease. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity, and some plant products have been shown to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that cross-resistance with agents already in use may be minimal. Essential oils Many essential oils included in herbal pharmacopoeias are claimed to possess antimicrobial activity, with the oils of bay, cinnamon, clove and thyme reported to be the most potent in studies with foodborne bacterial pathogens. Active constituents include terpenoids and secondary metabolites. Despite their prevalent use in alternative medicine, essential oils have seen limited use in mainstream medicine. While 25 to 50% of pharmaceutical compounds are plant-derived, none are used as antimicrobials, though there has been increased research in this direction. Barriers to increased usage in mainstream medicine include poor regulatory oversight and quality control, mislabeled or misidentified products, and limited modes of delivery. Antimicrobial pesticides According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and defined by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, antimicrobial pesticides are used in order to control growth of microbes through disinfection, sanitation, or reduction of development and to protect inanimate objects, industrial processes or systems, surfaces, water, or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, or slime. =Antimicrobial pesticide products= The EPA monitors products, such as disinfectants/sanitizers for use in hospitals or homes, in order to ascertain efficacy. Products that are meant for public health are therefore under this monitoring system, including products used for drinking water, swimming pools, food sanitation, and other environmental surfaces. These pesticide products are registered under the premise that, when used properly, they do not demonstrate unreasonable side effects to humans or the environment. Even once certain products are on the market, the EPA continues to monitor and evaluate them to make sure they maintain efficacy in protecting public health. Public health products regulated by the EPA are divided into three categories: * Sterilizers (Sporicides): Eliminate all bacteria, fungi, spores, and viruses. * Disinfectants: Destroy or inactivate microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses,) but may not act as sporicides (as those are the most difficult form to destroy). According to efficacy data, the EPA will classify a disinfectant as limited, general/broad spectrum, or as a hospital disinfectant. * Sanitizers: Reduce the number of microorganisms, but may not kill or eliminate all of them. =Antimicrobial pesticide safety= According to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, health-care workers can take steps to improve their safety measures against antimicrobial pesticide exposure. Workers are advised to minimize exposure to these agents by wearing protective equipment, gloves, and safety glasses. Additionally, it is important to follow the handling instructions properly, as that is how the EPA has deemed them as safe to use. Employees should be educated about the health hazards and encouraged to seek medical care if exposure occurs. =Ozone= Ozone can kill microorganisms in air, water and process equipment and has been used in settings such as kitchen exhaust ventilation, garbage rooms, grease traps, biogas plants, wastewater treatment plants, textile production, breweries, dairies, food and hygiene production, pharmaceutical industries, bottling plants, zoos, municipal drinking-water systems, swimming pools and spas, and in the laundering of clothes and treatment of in‚Äìhouse mold and odors. =Antimicrobial Scrubs= Antimicrobial scrubs can reduce the accumulation of odors and stains on scrubs, which in turn improves their longevity. These scrubs also come in a variety of colors and styles. As antimicrobial technology develops at a rapid pace, these scrubs are readily available, with more advanced versions hitting the market every year. These bacteria could then be spread to office desks, break rooms, computers, and other shared technology. This can lead to outbreaks and infections like MRSA, treatments for which cost the healthcare industry $20 billion a year. Physical =Heat= Both dry and moist heat are effective in eliminating microbial life. For example, jars used to store preserves such as jam can be sterilized by heating them in a conventional oven. Heat is also used in pasteurization, a method for slowing the spoilage of foods such as milk, cheese, juices, wines and vinegar. Such products are heated to a certain temperature for a set period of time, which greatly reduces the number of harmful microorganisms. =Radiation= Foods are often irradiated to kill harmful pathogens. Common sources of radiation used in food sterilization include cobalt-60 (a gamma emitter), electron beams and x-rays. Ultraviolet light is also used to disinfect drinking water, both in small scale personal- use systems and larger scale community water purification systems.

An upright pole with two crosspieces upon which are screwed beer bottle tops. The noise is made by hitting the instrument on the floor, at the same time striking the middle section with a solid piece of wood. is a traditional English percussion instrument, used in folk music. The origins of the name are not known but it is believed to stem from an association with Roma, Spanish and Italian buskers who were popular in London in the Victorian era. Alternatively, the name \\"Monkey Stick\\" could come from modern practice, in homage to the trained monkeys formerly used by buskers to solicit money from passersby. Some musicians have taken to fixing a small stuffed toy monkey to the tops of their instruments. The instrument is constructed from a stout pole with metal \\"jingles\\" fastened at intervals along the shaft. These are commonly beer- bottle tops with a 1 inch washer in between the tops and the shaft to enhance the quality of the sound. Originally the end of the shaft is believed to have been covered with a rag to give some protection to the floor. A boot that might be attached to the base of the pole is a recent 'Zob Stick' addition. When played on a wooden floor (common in ale-houses), the sound produced is a combination of a bass drum and tambourine. It can also be played with an additional small notched or serrated stick held in the other hand, allowing it to not only be shaken or hammered onto the ground, but also \\"bowed\\" to produce a combined clicking and rattling sound. In Australia, this instrument constructed with beer-bottle tops is known as a Lagerphone, a variation of the traditional aboriginal instrument using shells. The same name and construction is found in New Zealand. In Newfoundland, it is referred to as an \\"Ugly stick\\". In the Dutch province Friesland this type of instrument is known as a 'kuttepiel'. In the American upper-Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the closely related stumpf fiddle or pogocello originated in Czech communities and adds small cymbals, strings, and a drum. A similar instrument, the batih, is found in Ukraine. The 'Zob Stick' variation of this instrument was constructed and named in 1968 by percussionist and songwriter Keef Trouble of the band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts and Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs. It is now, with the term ‚ÄòLagerphone‚Äô, the most commonly used name for this instrument. The Brett Marvin invented term 'Zob' was taken from an old risqu√© UK naval term that has the same meaning in French. The Keef Trouble 'Zob Stick' is distinguished by the first introduction of a sprung-boot attached to the bottom of the pole and a metal sleeve round its centre, this being hit with a serrated wooden stick.

Self-interest generally refers to a focus on the needs or desires (interests) of one's self. Most times, actions that display self-interest are often performed without conscious knowing. A number of philosophical, psychological, and economic theories examine the role of self-interest in motivating human action. In philosophy Philosophical concepts concerned with self-interest include: *Enlightened self-interest, a philosophy which states that acting to further the interests of others also serves one's own self-interest. *Ethical egoism, the ethical position that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self- interest. *Hedonism, the school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good. Cyrenaics, the Aristippean pre-Socratic original. Epicureanism, a philosophical system related to hedonism. *Individualism, a philosophy stressing the worth of individual selves. *Rational egoism, the position that all rational actions are those done in one's self-interest. In psychology Psychological concepts concerned with self-interest include psychological egoism, the view that humans are always motivated by self- interest and narcissism, which is an unhealthy self-absorption due to a disturbance in the sense of self. In business In business, self interest focuses on actions or activities that are advantageous to an individual or organization. For a business or individual to survive and grow, a degree of self-interest is necessary. When there is too much focus on self-interest, the benefits of the group at large diminishes. * Leadership,  The Wells Fargo scandal, proved that top managers who were concerned about meeting their quotas encouraged employees to set up fake checking and savings accounts so that their managers could meet quotas, and thus, gain incentives. In this case, the top managers put their own self-interest, i.e. desire for money and personal gain, above the well-being of their employees, and the reputation of the company they work for. * Innovation  Samuel P. Langley's desire to create the world's first aircraft was based primarily on his own self-interest rather than to improve humanity. Langley was an astronomer and around the age of 50 he decided that the only way to achieve his goal of becoming one of the great figures in the history of science was to be the first to create the ‚Äúflying machine‚Äù. Eventually, the Wright brothers were able to accomplish this task of creating the first flying machine in 1903. Even they were motivated by the fortune and fame that came with the feat. In this case, the brothers‚Äô self-interest benefited humanity for decades to come. * Conflict of interest  Managers are tasked with the responsibility of hiring new employees for open positions. When these managers choose to give these positions to friends or family, instead of the most qualified person for the job, it can be a result of the manager's desire to create a better situation for people in their family thus appealing to their own self-interest.

Perhaps accepting bribes is against the store's policy, but a store manager may make a deal because it is to his own personal benefit to do.

Bond portrays Kiki DuRane, an aging, alcoholic, female lounge singer. Mellman portrays her gay, male piano accompanist, known only as \\"Herb.\\" Despite Bond and Mellman being middle aged, their Kiki and Herb characters are, according to their elaborate fictional biographies, more than eighty years old. Both performers live in New York City, but the pair have performed from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., as well as Europe. The act alternates between musical numbers and long, seemingly inebriated monologues by Kiki. The musical numbers, often medleys, draw on an enormous range of popular music, from Broadway musicals to Nirvana and from Britney Spears to REO Speedwagon. Kiki and Herb have also covered songs by Suicidal Tendencies, The Mountain Goats, and Butt Trumpet. First wave: 1990‚Äì2004 Bond and Mellman began performing together in 1989, and created the characters of Kiki and Herb in the early 1990s in San Francisco. Between 1995 and 1996 Kiki and Herb appeared regularly at \\"Cowgirl Hall of Fame\\" in Greenwich Village, where they honed their show and built their fanbase. Among the devotees was John Cameron Mitchell, who later included Bond in his 2006 movie Shortbus. In 1998, the duo appeared at the first Gay Shame event, held at DUMBA in Brooklyn, and are seen briefly in the documentary short Gay Shame '98 by Scott Berry. In 1999, they performed weekly in Have Another at the Fez and received their first New York Times review. Their first album, the Christmas record Do You Hear What We Hear?, was released in 2000. In 2001, they received an Obie Award for the show Kiki and Herb: Jesus Wept. The duo appeared in a cameo role in the 2004 feature film Imaginary Heroes, released that year by Sony Pictures and starring, among others, Emile Hirsch, Jeff Daniels, and Sigourney Weaver. Kiki and Herb appear at a Christmas party attended by the main characters and perform an excerpt from \\"Tonight's the Kind of Night\\", the final track from their Christmas album. The same year, Kiki and Herb gave a \\"farewell\\" performance at New York City's Carnegie Hall. The one-night-only show Kiki and Herb Will Die for You featured several celebrities, including Sandra Bernhard, Isaac Mizrahi, Jake Shears, Michael Cavadias, and Rufus Wainwright; the recording of the show was released as the two-disc album Kiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall. After the performance the duo worked on other projects; Bond moved to London to study scenography, while Mellman worked in New York. Second coming: 2004‚Äì2008 Their hiatus was short lived. In 2005, the duo reunited for The Resurrection Tour of select U.S. cities. A European tour followed, which included a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Also in 2005, two films about the duo screened at festivals: Kiki and Herb Reloaded and Kiki and Herb on the Rocks. In the early summer of 2006, Bond and Mellman announced that Kiki and Herb would make their Broadway debut that August. After a handful of preview performances at the Wilma Theatre in Philadelphia, Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway debuted for a four-week run at the Helen Hayes Theatre on August 11. Reviews were mostly favorable, including a glowing assessment by Ben Brantley of the New York Times. For Brantley, Kiki \\"suggests some wondrous hybrid of Marianne Faithfull, Elaine Stritch, Patti Smith and Kitty Carlisle Hart,\\" her vocals \\"radioactive with an angry sorrow, ecstasy, and cosmic fatigue\\" in which \\"the point is never the prettiness of the voice but the history behind it and the passion to endure that vibrates within.\\" The duo began a run of Sunday-night shows at Joe's Pub in New York City in January 2007, and toured the United States with The Year of Magical Drinking in the Spring and Summer of that year. On May 15, 2007, Kiki and Herb: Alive on Broadway was nominated for a Tony Award for \\"Best Special Theatrical Event\\"; the New York Observer predicted the duo would win, but they did not. Following a world tour, the duo returned to Carnegie Hall on December 12, 2007 with the holiday show \\"Kiki and Herb: The Second Coming.\\" Their concert DVD Kiki and Herb: Live at the Knitting Factory was recorded in 2007 and released January 2008; in addition to the performance, the DVD release included bonus clips from performances by Bond and Mellman in 1993, 1999, and 2005. Their March 2008 performance at Perez Hilton's 30th birthday party would be their final show for many years. Revivification: 2016 In September 2015, Justin Vivian Bond and Kenny Mellman announced the return of Kiki and Herb with a new show, Seeking Asylum! at Joe's Pub from April 21 to May 6, 2016.Kiki and Herb Plan Reunion at Joe‚Äôs Pub Fictional biography For years, Bond and Mellman maintained a meticulous backstory for their characters, one made official on the Kiki and Herb MySpace page and their official website. This involved the characters meeting as children in a mental institution before becoming a jazz act in the fifties, beginning a long and chequered career mixing periods of success and misfortune. The shows were supposedly part of their comeback trail, and they would perform songs supposedly from throughout their career (which were actually anachronistic covers). Between songs Kiki would tell anecdotes from her life, including her friendships with Billie Holiday and Grace Kelly, and the details of her various relationships, whilst drinking heavily and often having on-stage rages and breakdowns. However, in \\"Alive on Broadway,\\" they introduced the notion that the fictional backstory may be meta-fictional‚ÄîKiki spoke of the duo actually being thousands of years old, implying that some of her previous stories were, at least in part, lies told by the character. After the Broadway show, Bond and Mellman consistently included this twist in their shows' monologues‚ÄîKiki will talk about knowing Jesus \\"in the Biblical sense,\\" hanging around with Marie Antoinette, and even romancing a young Adolf Hitler.

It is now a branch (more accurately, several related areas) of the field of functional analysis, connected with spectral theory. (Historically, the term was also used synonymously with calculus of variations; this usage is obsolete, except for functional derivative. Sometimes it is used in relation to types of functional equations, or in logic for systems of predicate calculus.) If f is a function, say a numerical function of a real number, and M is an operator, there is no particular reason why the expression :f(M) should make sense. If it does, then we are no longer using f on its original function domain. In the tradition of operational calculus, algebraic expressions in operators are handled irrespective of their meaning. This passes nearly unnoticed if we talk about 'squaring a matrix', though, which is the case of f(x) = x2 and M an n√ón matrix. The idea of a functional calculus is to create a principled approach to this kind of overloading of the notation. The most immediate case is to apply polynomial functions to a square matrix, extending what has just been discussed. In the finite-dimensional case, the polynomial functional calculus yields quite a bit of information about the operator. For example, consider the family of polynomials which annihilates an operator T. This family is an ideal in the ring of polynomials. Furthermore, it is a nontrivial ideal: let n be the finite dimension of the algebra of matrices, then {I, T, T2...Tn} is linearly dependent. So ‚àë Œ±i Ti = 0 for some scalars Œ±i, not all equal to 0. This implies that the polynomial ‚àë Œ±i xi lies in the ideal. Since the ring of polynomials is a principal ideal domain, this ideal is generated by some polynomial m. Multiplying by a unit if necessary, we can choose m to be monic. When this is done, the polynomial m is precisely the minimal polynomial of T. This polynomial gives deep information about T. For instance, a scalar Œ± is an eigenvalue of T if and only if Œ± is a root of m. Also, sometimes m can be used to calculate the exponential of T efficiently. The polynomial calculus is not as informative in the infinite-dimensional case. Consider the unilateral shift with the polynomials calculus; the ideal defined above is now trivial. Thus one is interested in functional calculi more general than polynomials. The subject is closely linked to spectral theory, since for a diagonal matrix or multiplication operator, it is rather clear what the definitions should be.

Born in South Africa, Greig qualified to play for the England cricket team by virtue of his Scottish parentage. He was a tall () batting all-rounder who bowled both medium pace and off spin. Greig was captain of England from 1975 to 1977, and captained Sussex. His younger brother, Ian, also played Test cricket, while several other members of his extended family played at first-class level.Tony Greig profile at CricketArchive. Retrieved 29 December 2012. A leading player in English county cricket, Greig is thought by some former players and pundits to have been one of England's leading international all-rounders.Greg Chappell: \\"He wouldn't have made it as a bowler or batsman, but his determination made him a top all- rounder\\", Tossell, p. 93.Derek Underwood \\"... you never hear of him mentioned as being a top-quality cricketer, but he was.\\" Tossell, p. 98.John Snow \\"... he was as good an all-rounder as Freddie Flintoff, if not better.\\" Tossell, p. 98. He helped Kerry Packer start World Series Cricket by signing up many of his English colleagues as well as West Indian and Pakistani cricketers, a move which cost him the England captaincy. He is also noted for a controversial run-out of Alvin Kallicharran in a Test Match against the West Indies in 1974, and often clashed with Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee on the 1974‚Äì75 Ashes Tour in Australia. His infamous \\"grovel\\" statement in the lead-up to the 1976 tour of England by the West Indies was met with severe criticism. Greig became a commentator following the end of his playing career, later emigrating to Australia. A long-term sufferer from epilepsy, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2012. Greig died in Sydney, on 29 December 2012, from an apparent heart attack. Early life and career Greig was born to a Scottish immigrant father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College ‚Äî during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. \\"He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He would look at me sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'\\".Wisden 1975 After Greig scored 156 in 230 minutes against a strong Lancashire attack in his first game for Sussex, his future direction changed irrevocably. He wrote a brief note to his father, telling him he would not be coming back to go to university. Greig set a goal of making the England Test team in six years, though he returned to play in South Africa during the winter for a number of years, eventually transferring to Eastern Province for the 1970‚Äì71 season. Controversy and triumph in the Caribbean Greig was now experimenting with finger-spin to complement his medium pace. He set off to the West Indies with the England team in early 1974 and ran straight into a major controversy. On the second day of the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, the West Indies had cruised to a first innings lead of 143, thanks mainly to 142 not out from Alvin Kallicharran. With four wickets still in hand, the home team was in a dominant position when the last ball of the day was bowled to Bernard Julien, who blocked it past Greig (fielding in close on the off side) and then headed off to the pavilion with Kallicharran. However, Greig fielded the ball, whirled around, threw down the stumps, and appealed for a run out decision against Kallicharran. Umpire Douglas Sang Hue gave the batsman out, and a near-riot broke out in the crowd. The spectators stormed the ground and laid siege to the pavilion, calling for the decision to be revoked. Technically, the decision was correct as Sang Hue had not called time on the day's play, but Greig's actions were considered unsporting, and together with the crowd's reaction, the England captain revoked the appeal. Kallicharran was reinstated the following day, when he took his score to 158. The incident was controversial ‚Äì some believing it a black stain on his character, others prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. For his part, Greig claimed that his actions were not premeditated, that his back was to the play and he was unaware that proceedings were over. If his actions had been premeditated, they would have been rather reckless given the risk of stirring up the notoriously volatile Trinidadian crowd. England convincingly lost the Test and Greig failed with bat and ball. It was a measure of his resolve and determination as a cricketer that he dominated the remainder of the series, scoring 430 runs at 47.7, taking 24 wickets (most of them with spin) at 22.6 and seven catches. He scored 148, backed up with six wickets, in the third Test in Barbados, 121 in the fourth Test in Guyana and won the fifth Test in Trinidad for his team with bowling figures of 8 for 86 and 5 for 70. Many of his victims in this game were gained via off-spin, a new addition to the Greig repertoire. This victory enabled England to draw the series, and Greig left the Caribbean. Road to the captaincy During the summer of 1974, England faced three Tests against India and three against Pakistan. Overall, Greig averaged 41.5 with the bat and grabbed 14 wickets. His highlight was a century against India at Lord's. This was a good tune-up for the Ashes tour of Australia at year's end, where England would probably start favourite and Greig would be a key player. Shocked by the Australian fast bowling attack of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee, most English batsmen struggled in the first Test at Brisbane. However, Greig played a lone hand with 110 in the first innings. Greig played in the first World Cup in England in 1975, when his team was eliminated by Australia in the semi-final. Although suited to the one-day game, Greig never really produced a major performance in the 22 ODIs that he played for England. After the tournament ended, Australia stayed on to play four Ashes Tests. England lost the first match at Edgbaston, and blame fell on the captain Mike Denness, who had just endured a 1‚Äì4 defeat in Australia. Denness was sacked and Greig appointed, to high expectation that he would play aggressively and fearlessly in an endeavour to counteract the Australians' strengths.\\"Greg saves a collapse\\". The Sydney Morning Herald. 1 August 1975 Commercial skipper The transformation was swift. In the Second Test at Lord's, Greig received a huge ovation on his way to bat and delivered 96 runs. He scored 41 in the second innings and took three wickets in a drawn match that favoured England. The run continued in the next match at Leeds with England poised for victory at the end of the second last day. But vandals destroyed the pitch during the night and Greig agreed to abandon the match, thus conceding the Ashes. The final game ended in a long-winded draw. With a long gap between England commitments, Greig headed to Australia for the 1975‚Äì76 season to play grade cricket in Sydney. Greig was well-known among colleagues as a man who wanted to take commercial advantage of his profile as a leading sportsman. He signed a number of endorsements and appeared in commercials in Australia, most famously in his ads for the new breakfast cereal \\"Nutri-Grain\\", where his catchphrase \\"It's just like a cricket bat with holes\\" struck a chord.Lalor, Peter (29 December 2012) \\"Cricket loses Tony Greig, one of its giants\\". The Australian. \\"I intend to make them grovel\\" When he returned to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players: > I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, because I'm > not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people > tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5‚Äì1 by the > Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against > the Indians just a short time ago as well. Sure, they've got a couple of > fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more > sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried > about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get > on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I > intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them > grovel.Tossell The outcry was instantaneous. The word \\"grovel\\" had sinister connotations for West Indian people, many of whom have slave ancestry. Moreover, apartheid and the Gleneagles Agreement were prominent issues of the day, so a white South African using the word \\"grovel\\" heavily accentuated the faux pas. The West Indian fast bowlers took great delight in adding yards to their run-up when Greig came to the wicket and their supporters took equal delight when his wicket was captured. At times during the series, the West Indies were roundly criticised for their use of short-pitched bowling. To compensate for his unusual height and attempt to combat such bowling, Greig held the bat at shoulder height (rather than leave it on the ground) as the bowler ran in, thus not using a back swing of the bat. While it helped him to combat the short ball, it left him vulnerable to the yorker (full pitch) and he was bowled quite regularly for a top order batsman. The West Indian bowlers managed to hit Greig's stumps often. Apart from a formidable performance in the fourth Test at Leeds, where he fought back with 116 and 76 not out and shared a big partnership with keeper Alan Knott, Greig scored just 51 runs in seven innings. Worse, his bowling lost penetration and he took only five wickets as England slumped to a 0‚Äì3 loss. However, Greig did not lose his sense of humour: playing on his \\"grovel\\" comment, he pretended to crawl on his hands and knees in front of the open stands on the Harleyford Road side of The Oval in the last Test match, delighting the crowds that had previously jeered him. Redemption in India The best performance of Greig's captaincy career came in 1976‚Äì77, when England toured India for a five-Test series. England had not won a Test series on the subcontinent for fifteen years and were clear underdogs against an Indian team that boasted some of the best spinners in the world and could count on the support of tens of thousands of vociferous fans who would fill the stadia. Greig made good use of his experience from his previous tour and consciously set out to build a rapport with the Indian crowd, for instance, playing 'dead' when loud firecrackers went off in the ground.Eagar, Patrick (1982) Test Decade 1972‚Äì82. World's Work Ltd. ASIN: B00110KLXY England went on to score one of their most convincing wins in a very long time when they won the first three Tests by huge margins. Greig rated the win at Calcutta, when he scored 103 on a broken pitch, and struggling with a stomach bug, in front of 100,000 Indian fans, as the finest moment of his career. With 342 runs (at 42) and ten wickets, Greig had regained form to take with him to Australia. Centenary Test and Packer After a brief sojourn in Sri Lanka, Greig's team arrived in Australia in March 1977 to prepare for a unique moment in the game's history. To commemorate 100 years of Australia vs England Test Matches, a one-off Test was organised for the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue of the first-ever Test. The associated functions and a gathering of hundreds of ex-players demonstrated the depth of the game and its history. Greig, recognising the spirit of the fixture, had his team play positively, and the match was still in the balance late on the last day before Australia won by 45 runs. Everyone marvelled at the margin, as it was the same as the first-ever Test, and there was a self-satisfied air to proceedings that would be shattered in just two months' time. Greig had played well in the match (18 and 41, two wickets and four catches) and he left an open letter with a newspaper thanking the people of Melbourne for their support. On his return home, a surprise crew was waiting to film an episode of This Is Your Life. Just weeks before, he had signed a contract with the owner of the Nine Network in Australia, Kerry Packer, to play cricket in a series that would take place during the next Australian summer. Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer by signing a number of English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, although Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7‚Äì10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was taken aback by the severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy. Surprisingly, Greig retained his position in the team for the five Tests under his successor Mike Brearley. Jeering accompanied his appearance for the remainder of that summer. His form proved only average after he made a dramatic 91 at Lord's in the opening Test. England defeated a dispirited Australian team 3‚Äì0 to reclaim the Ashes after four games. Brearley convinced the Selectors to retain Greig for the last Test, and requested that he received a share of any bonus due to the team. Greig's Test career ended quietly at The Oval on 30 August 1977. But his work for World Series Cricket (WSC, Packer's organisation) was just beginning. In September, backed by Packer, he was the plaintiff (along with Mike Proctor and John Snow) in a case against the English authorities (the TCCB), who were attempting to ban Packer's players from Test and first-class cricket. Greig was conspicuous throughout the trial and elated when the decision went in favour of WSC. The lack of regular domestic cricket as well as the intensity of World Series Cricket brought a premature end to his career as he could not recover from a poor start in the first season. The super-Test final of the 1978‚Äì79 season was the last match Greig played at any level of cricket. During an interview on the eve of the match, he \\"promised\\" a century to the audience. He fell short by exactly 100 runs, caught behind off his arch rival, Dennis Lillee. Epilepsy Greig had his first epileptic fit at the age of 14, during a tennis match. As he successfully controlled the condition with medication and self-management, largely by sleeping as and when he could during Test Matches, few knew about it for much of his playing career. He was often forewarned by auras. In 1971‚Äì72, he collapsed on the field during his first match for Eastern Province and half a dozen teammates were required to hold down his large frame. The incident was explained away as heat stroke thanks to sympathetic media and team management. Returning from the tour of Australia in 1975, Greig had another epileptic fit at Heathrow Airport. His affliction became public during the Packer furore, when a number of commentators questioned his judgement in the matter and speculated that epilepsy impaired his ability to make decisions.\\"Epilepsy report angers Greig\\". The Sydney Morning Herald. 12 September 1978 Later career After forming a bond with the Nine Network's Kerry Packer during the World Series Cricket days, Greig was offered a \\"job for life\\" by Packer as a commentator during Nine's cricket coverage. Greig spent the rest of his life in Australia and continued his commentary role. He was regarded as one of cricket's top commentators in his career, noted for being unbiased, witty, and deeply enthusiastic about the game. His pitch reports, where he would use a car key or a pen to illustrate pitch characteristics or crack sizes (including the odd moment where his implements would become stuck in the pitch), were fondly remembered and imitated by fans. During the 2006 Ashes Perth Test, on commenting on the need for England's Steve Harmison to intimidate Australia's number 11 Glenn McGrath, Greig indicated the need to \\"Touch him up, before rolling him over\\". Greig commentated for Channel Four in the United Kingdom, the SABC when making occasional trips home, and for Sky Sports' coverage of England's 2012 tour of Sri Lanka. He also hosted a regular weekly podcast called The Tony Greig Show for Cricinfo, covering international cricket matters and airing his forthright views in a section called \\"What's eating Tony Greig this week?\\". His love of the game may be encapsulated by a comment he made on Cricinfo in mid-2012: \\"Give your hand to cricket and it will take you on the most fantastic journey, a lifetime journey both on and off the field.\\" In 1999 Greig was involved in a controversy when, in a match at the North Sydney Oval, the camera zoomed onto a white, Caucasian man and an Asian woman in a marriage ceremony at a nearby church. Greig made a comment implying the woman shown was a mail order bride: \\"Do you think she‚Äôs been flown in?\\". He later said that the comment was made \\"off microphone and not intended for broadcast\\". He joined the Indian Cricket League as an Executive Board Member, but the league ultimately ceased with the growing popularity of Indian Premier League. Greig was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Outside of cricket media he served as a board member of Epilepsy Action Australia for 19 years up to his death. In March 2011, he was appointed as the brand ambassador for Sri Lanka Tourism. Initially the appointment was for six months, for which he received about 10,000. On 26 June 2012 Greig delivered the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture and criticised the BCCI for misuse of powers and money and continuously rejecting the ICC's call for universal acceptance of the Umpire Decision Review System. He also asked the BCCI to abandon self-interest and \\"embrace the spirit of cricket and govern in the best interests of world cricket, not just for India and its business partners.\\" Tony Greig is regarded fondly by Sri Lankan cricket fans. He would often take the opportunity to advertise the country as a tourist destination during his commentary. A thinly-veiled fictionalized version of Greig as a TV pundit living a rock star lifestyle behind the scenes appeared in the Gratiaen, Commonwealth and DSC South Asian Literature prize-winning novel Chinaman: The Legend of Pradeep Mathew by Shehan Karunatilaka. Lung cancer and death Greig began to have severe bouts of coughing in May 2012; initially bronchitis was diagnosed. After undergoing tests a small malignant lesion was found in his right lung. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2012. He underwent an operation for the cancer in November and the same month told fellow commentator Mark Nicholas during an interview broadcast by the Nine Network that \\"It's not good. The truth is I've got lung cancer. It's now just a question of what they can do.\\" Greig died at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney on 29 December 2012 after going into cardiac arrest following a suspected heart attack. He was 66.

It is typically used in morphological operations, such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, as well as the hit-or-miss transform. According to Georges Matheron, knowledge about an object (e.g., an image) depends on the manner in which we probe (observe) it.See (Dougherty 1992), chapter 1, page 1. In particular, the choice of a certain structuring element for a particular morphological operation influences the information one can obtain. There are two main characteristics that are directly related to structuring elements: * Shape. For example, the structuring element can be a \\"ball\\" or a line; convex or a ring, etc. By choosing a particular structuring element, one sets a way of differentiating some objects (or parts of objects) from others, according to their shape or spatial orientation. * Size. For example, one structuring element can be a 3\\\\times 3 square or a 21\\\\times 21 square. Setting the size of the structuring element is similar to setting the observation scale, and setting the criterion to differentiate image objects or features according to size. Mathematical particulars and examples Structuring elements are particular cases of binary images, usually being small and simple. In mathematical morphology, binary images are subsets of a Euclidean space Rd or the integer grid Zd, for some dimension d. Here are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by B): * Let E=R2; B is an open disk of radius r, centered at the origin. * Let E=Z2; B is a 3x3 square, that is, B={(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)}. * Let E=Z2; B is the \\"cross\\" given by: B={(-1,0),(0,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)}. In the discrete case, a structuring element can also be represented as a set of pixels on a grid, assuming the values 1 (if the pixel belongs to the structuring element) or 0 (otherwise). When used by a hit-or-miss transform, usually the structuring element is a composite of two disjoint sets (two simple structuring elements), one associated to the foreground, and one associated to the background of the image to be probed. In this case, an alternative representation of the composite structuring element is as a set of pixels which are either set (1, associated to the foreground), not set (0, associated to the background) or \\"don't care\\".

Available from Mondays to Fridays except on public holiday, with a target audience of white-collar workers and urban youth. It is published by Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd, which is part of the Berjaya Media Group (formerly known as Nexnews Berhad). theSun was launched on 1 June 1993, which was originally The Sun. It stopped publication on 30 June 1994, for a revamp, and resumed a month later. It became a free newspaper in 2002. Home delivery is available at RM0.30. Audited circulation figures by Audit Bureau of Circulations Malaysia for January‚ÄìJune 2015, theSun is the highest circulated English newspaper, with a circulation of 306,249.  History  Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd (SMCSB) was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 19 July 1991 as a private limited company under the name of Fikiran Abadi Sdn Bhd. On 8 December 1994, it changed its name to Sun Media Group Sdn Bhd before assuming its present name on 22 August 1998. The principal activity of SMCSB is the publication of theSun newspaper, an English language national daily that was launched in 1993. On 8 April 2002, theSun newspaper was relaunched as a free national daily. On 4 March 2008, Berjaya Corporation Berhad acquired a substantial stake from the holding company, Nexnews Berhad, and consequently SMCSB has been announced to be a subsidiary of Berjaya Corporation Berhad. On 23 April 2008, Nexnews Berhad changed its name to Berjaya Media Berhad.  Sections  theSun covers national and international news as well as sports, property, media & marketing and lifestyle & entertainment. It has been redesigned with plenty of news briefs to cater to the reading habits of busy executives - the paper's target audience. theSun weekend was launched in the weekend of 15‚Äì16 May 2004, a revamp of its Saturday issue. It was however discontinued in March 2006 as it is not consistent with the free paper model.  Target audience  As of 2010, theSun prints and distributes 300,512 copies a day to approximately 3,337 targeted distribution points, called SunSpots (office buildings, condominiums, LRT stations, fast food outlets), primarily in the Klang Valley, also known as Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area. People can also get a copy of theSun in almost all Malaysian 7-Eleven stores or pay a newsvendor to deliver the paper to homes. The paper's circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC). In 2006, prompted by the rising demand for copies and advertisers' thirst for a wider reach, theSun, increased its print run by 76%. The increase took place in two phases, the first on 8 March, with circulation bumped up to 230,000 from 150,000 previously. The second phase saw circulation rising by another 15% to 265,000 copies on 2 October. Out of that, 215,000 copies are distributed in the Klang Valley, solidifying theSun's position as the top English daily in the nation's top consumer region.  Awards  theSun has won several awards for advertising. The Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia (4As) has awarded theSun the Media Partner of the Year Award (2004/2005). In the recent Malaysian Media Awards 2005, advertisements by MindShare/Nike and mediaedge:cia/ING Insurance published in theSun won Gold and Silver awards respectively. In March 2007, theSun achieved another milestone when three of its journalists won top awards given by the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) based in Hong Kong. SOPA, the Asian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize in the United States, picked theSun for Excellence in Public Service Journalism and Opinion Writing. The competition included more established regional publications. A first award, for Excellence in Opinion Writing, was for a series of six commentaries written by assistant news editor Jacqueline Ann Surin, who wrote a fortnightly column, Shape of a Pocket, published in the eXtra! section on Thursday. Surin beat an entry from the Far Eastern Economic Review's series of commentaries on Singapore, which received an honorary mention. theSun's second win, for Public Service Journalism, was for the story \\"Low Cost Palace\\" by the Special Reporting and Investigations team of editor R. Nadeswaran and deputy news editor Terence Fernandez who exposed the illegal mansion built by a former Selangor executive councillor. SOPA again gave theSun two awards in 2008; honourable mentions for Terence Fernancez and R. Nadeswaran in Public Service Journalism for their reports on the failed sports training centre in Brickendonbury and for R. Nadeswaran for Opinion Writing for his Citizen Nades bi-weekly columns. theSun has also won a number of Malaysian journalism awards for entertainment writing and investigative reporting.  Criticism  During the 1994 revamp of the newspaper, The Sun has been criticised for using a national flag in the masthead for commercial purposes. The Home Ministry said that the newspaper should not use the national flag in the masthead without permission. The newspaper resumed publication on 1 August 1994.

It is very close to the city centre and is bordered by the newer area of Garnethill to the south-west and old Townhead to the east. Cowcaddens was originally a village and became an industrious and thriving part of the expanding Glasgow, being close to Port Dundas and the Forth and Clyde Canal immediately to its north. Its boundaries merged into the City of Glasgow in 1846. By the 1880s, the area was becoming a slum district with the highest level of infant mortality (190 per thousand births) in the city, a figure which was three times that of the West End. The southern fringes of Cowcaddens have historically housed one of Glasgow's premier entertainment districts, with theatres and music halls including the former Scottish Zoo and Hippodrome in New City Road, the Grand Theatre at Cowcaddens Cross,Glasgow‚Äôs Crosses, Glasgow History, 28 May 2016 Theatre Royal at the upper end of Hope Street, the massive Cineworld multi- storey cinema complex and the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall at the top of West Nile Street. The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, now known as the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is in Renfrew Street at its junction with Hope Street. From 1957 to 2006, the headquarters of STV were located there - having since relocated to Pacific Quay. Two other former theatres, the Royalty Theatre and the Glasgow Apollo (now occupied by the Cineworld complex) used to stand close to the area. The former Cowcaddens Free Church now houses the National Piping Centre. Housing in the area is primarily ex-council housing (there are no council houses in Glasgow since their transfer to the Glasgow Housing Association). Glasgow Caledonian University is nearby. Cowcaddens is served by Cowcaddens subway station on the Glasgow Subway system, and by bus services through it and emanating from Buchanan Bus Station. The socialist politician Edward Hunter, who was instrumental in helping build the Left in New Zealand, was a Labour councillor for Cowcaddens from 1937 until 1959.

Polimeni, and Ping Zhang. Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013. Print. More specifically. in trying to prove a proposition P, one first assumes by contradiction that it is false, and that therefore there must be at least one counterexample. With respect to some idea of size (which may need to be chosen carefully), one then concludes that there is such a counterexample C that is minimal. In regard to the argument, C is generally something quite hypothetical (since the truth of P excludes the possibility of C), but it may be possible to argue that if C existed, then it would have some definite properties which, after applying some reasoning similar to that in an inductive proof, would lead to a contradiction, thereby showing that the proposition P is indeed true. If the form of the contradiction is that we can derive a further counterexample D, that is smaller than C in the sense of the working hypothesis of minimality, then this technique is traditionally called proof by infinite descent. In which case, there may be multiple and more complex ways to structure the argument of the proof. The assumption that if there is a counterexample, there is a minimal counterexample, is based on a well-ordering of some kind. The usual ordering on the natural numbers is clearly possible, by the most usual formulation of mathematical induction; but the scope of the method can include well-ordered induction of any kind.  Examples  The minimal counterexample method has been much used in the classification of finite simple groups. The Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem, that finite simple groups that are not cyclic groups have even order, was based on the hypothesis of some, and therefore some minimal, simple group G of odd order. Every proper subgroup of G can be assumed a solvable group, meaning that much theory of such subgroups could be applied. Euclid's proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a simple proof which uses a minimal counterexample.

It is situated immediately north-east of Glasgow city centre and contains a residential sector (redeveloped from an older neighbourhood in the mid 20th century, largely with tower blocks), a commercial/industrial sector and the campus of the University of Strathclyde. Location In ancient times, Townhead was an undeveloped area situated north of the cathedral and town with no definitive boundaries. Today, it is bordered to the west by Cowcaddens, to the north by Sighthill, to the east by Royston and Ladywell and to the south by Merchant City. The boundaries of Townhead are thus North Hanover Street and Dobbie's Loan to the west, the M8 motorway to the north, Castle Street and High Street to the east and George Street to the south. Housing Housing is primarily ex-council stock (Glasgow has no council houses since their transfer to the Glasgow Housing Association), although there are a number of student residences for International Christian College, Glasgow Caledonian University and Strathclyde University. Most of the housing units are fairly modern 8 in a block flats, although its most visually obvious features are the four 24-storey high-rise flats named \\"2 Taylor Place\\", \\"15 Grafton Place\\", \\"7 St Mungo's Place\\" and \\"12 Dobbies Loan Place\\".  History  Church of St Mungo, Townhead It is widely accepted that near the eastern edge of modern day Townhead, is where St Kentigern, also known as St Mungo, built his church by the banks of the Molendinar Burn and thus established Glasgow. Glasgow Cathedral, dedicated to St Mungo, is roughly situated where Mungo's original church once stood. The present building dates back to the 12th century. Today, the Cathedral sits immediately outside of Townhead's boundaries and falls into the Ladywell area. Provand's Lordship, Glasgow's oldest remaining house, was constructed from the late 15th century by Bishop Andrew, later given the surname Muirhead as part of St Nicholas Hospital, a lodging for the poor. The hospital, or more accurately a hospitium, provided accommodation for twelve poor men as well their care who contributed through work in the hospital, Bible study and a products from the gardens. The gardens were restored in 1997 and like the original St Nicolas garden, the herb grown are those known for healing properties and medicinal use. The martyrdom of the Covenanters took place in the modern area called Townhead. The northern part of Castle Street was the town limits beyond which was called the \\"Howgait\\". Howgait was the scene of public hangings and used until 1781, when they moved to Glasgow Green. The area is now mainly taken up by Junction 15 of the M8. The Townhead \\"B\\" multi storey housing estate, built in 1967 The former Martyrs' Church building (moved to its current location in 1975 and then closed by members vote in 2011) contained until September 2013 the Martyrs stone, which details the executions in 1684 of James Nisbet (a farmer from Louden Parish in Ayrshire), James Lawson and Alex Wood. The stone, which originally stood in front of Townhead library, along with a large part of the once densely packed Townhead, was demolished to make way for the M8 motorway. The stone can now be found in the church wall of \\"The Evangelical Church\\" which is at the South East side of Cathedral square. Martyrs church also contained the \\"Martyrs church bell\\", which was preserved from the old Martyrs West church building until 2013 at which point, finding no new home, the bell was melted. The church of Scotland is currently seeking a buyer for the land which has planning permission for an extensive housing development and community building. The Church of Scotland still supporting Townhead through the parish ministry of Glasgow Cathedral and by giving temporary accommodation to SIMY Community Development charity which was formally an active part of the previous church's parish care. Since closure, SIMY has become an independent, local volunteer lead charity providing youth work support, arts provision, sports coaching, life skills, outdoor education, drop in diversionary clubs and is a DofE centre. SiMY owes its survival to the support it receives from the Church, Iona Community, Townhead community council, AplusM training, Glasgow Housing Association, Glasgow Community Safety Services, Glasgow Life and a dedicated group of volunteers many of whom have grown up in the local area or work nearby. St Mungo's Church, Parson Street (George Goldie, 1869) is Italiante-Gothic in style. 70 Parson Street is the birthplace of architect Charles Rennie MacIntosh, who also aided in the design of Martyr's School, at 17 Parson Street. This modern day view from the drumlin of Rottenrow shows St. Mungo's vantage point to the south of the city. Today it is dominated by the buildings of Strathclyde University which occupies a large swathe of Townhead. In line with post-war gentrification going on in Glasgow at the time, and in line with recommendations from the Bruce Report, the 1960s saw great change in Townhead. Like Anderston and the Gorbals, Townhead was designated a Comprehensive Development Area (CDA), which meant that much of the existing buildings would be cleared and its population rehomed.Townhead, c 1970, The Glasgow StoryParliamentary Rd, 1978, Virtual Mitchell New multi-storey housing in tower blocks replaced the slum tenements, whilst others were moved to new estates on the outer fringes of the city. As a result, very few of the original tenements in Townhead have survived. The Glasgow Inner Ring Road would also cut a tranche through the area, although the controversial eastern flank (which would have literally wiped out a whole tranche of the present day Merchant City) was abandoned in the late 1970s. The plans also entailed the complete demolition and rebuilding of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, however the scheme was eventually scaled back and the original Victorian hospital was given an indefinite stay of execution. The artist Joan Eardley captured much of this redevelopment from her studio in Townhead.Review of Joan Eardley's Townhead, Pat's Guide to Glasgow West End The southern reaches of the area were cleared to make way for the burgeoning campus of the newly established University of Strathclyde, where can be found the famous and oldest of Townhead's streets ‚Äì Rottenrow. It was from this high vantage point that St. Mungo could see, south, down to the River Clyde and be forewarned of the approach of any hostile people. Rottenrow was also home to the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. This hospital is now demolished and replaced by a garden. Recent developments Townhead has a community council of local volunteers. Recently Townhead was merged for community council purposes with the neighbouring Ladywell area of Glasgow. This resulted in the formation of Townhead and Ladywell Community Council. The community council members were instrumental in obtaining the funding for a village hall in Townhead, which opened in 2013. They were less successful in obtaining planning concessions in relation to a massive campus development being built in Townhead by Glasgow College. The community council had expressed concerns about the proximity of the development to residential property, and argued for special planning conditions to be included given the potential for disruption to local people. Townhead has witnessed an abnormally high number of applications to convert standard homes into Houses of Multiple occupation (bedsits). The local community council has been at the forefront of articulating the local community's concerns in this regard. The recent sell off of the Glasgow Cathedral, Martyrs church building Removed a key community meeting space from the community and is due to add more student housing to the area. SIMY Community Development, a large local volunteer run youth and community charity, are backed by the community council in efforts to develop new youth work for young people in Townhead by transporting to other areas as Townhead no longer as any indoor sports areas. The demolition of the Martyrs church will be the third large community building removed from the area since 2012 which saw the closure of St David School and The Hurdy Gurdy. It will also remove the only indoor sports courts still available to the public and community groups in the G4 / South G21 area. SiMY's silver DofE groups were working to improve the environment around the form Martyrs church building aesthetically as well as making it a useful place for them once the building is demolished. They were unsuccessful in their submitted plan for \\"stalled spaces\\" project as the General trustees of the church of Scotland were concerns that any work could hamper sale of the land. The DofE's group plans were supported by the \\"Townhead and Ladywell Community Council\\" and so are seeking advice from Glasgow Planning about possibilities. The Martyrs stone was moved on 12 September 2013 to the Glasgow Evangelical Church in Cathedral square by Glasgow City Council at the request of the Glasgow Evangelical Church and the Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association to Cathedral Square, a historical centre of Glasgow, where it can be seen by Glaswegians and tourists. The Townhead Village Hall opened in 2013 and provides for social activities and services for the Townhead community. The building and the land on which it has been built is owned by a community led company. With the recent changes preventing school lets in St Mungos School, the Village Hall is now the only facilities with space for community activities and functions. The hall is in use every day and evening providing vital services to the local community and private function space Thursday - Sunday. In Nov 2013 the village hall opened their Townhead Orchard providing a green space for local residence to enjoy gardening and tree maintenance under the supervision of centre staff during opening hours. The garden is protected by a high fence and security cameras. 2013 sees the start of Townhead's move to becoming the collegeland zone with planning applications being received for increased student accommodation to match the new large college campus for the area. This is part of the council's 2013-2018 development strategy for the area Transport links Townhead is also well situated for transport links with Glasgow Queen Street Station and Buchanan bus station on its doorstep.

Having been established amid the First World War, the company was from its onset focused upon the manufacture of military aircraft. It quickly found work producing large numbers of combat aircraft on behalf of the French military. However, following the end of the conflict, a major glut in surplus aircraft and the cancellation of many outstanding orders rapidly pushed the company into dire straights. Some officials, like Bloch, decided to withdraw from the aviation sector entirely in light of the poor economic prospects of the early 1920s aviation market. History The formation of the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôEtudes A√©ronautiques (SEA) can be largely attributed to the undertakings of two French engineers, Henry Potez and Marcel Bloch. Prior to SEA, Potez and Bloch had been talented aeronautical engineers that decided to form a partnership to development and manufacture of their original design of propellers, establishing the Soci√©t√© des H√©lices √âclair. However, they soon sought to go beyond just manufacturing components, but to undertake the design and construction of whole aircraft, thus, they both joined forces with another friend, Louis Coroller, to establish SEA. Its founding coincided with the First World War, and thus much of its activity was heavily influenced by the demands and lack thereof from this conflict. The SEA IV fighter The company was originally engaged to manufacture the SPAD VII fighter under licence. However, it soon developed its original designs and put those into production as well. Several early aircraft, starting with the SEA I, proved somewhat unsatisfactory and requiring further development. However, one such aircraft, the SEA IV, was selected for production for the French military. The \\"Minist√®re de l'Armement et des Fabrications de guerre\\" (Ministry of Armament and War Production) opted to place an order for 1,000 aircraft, which were intended to be produced at a rate of 200 per month and to be fulfilled by early 1919. To meet this rapid demand, Potez and Bloch founded a separate company, the Compagnie Anjou A√©ronautique (\\"Anjou Aeronautical Company\\"), to undertake their production. This entity was established at Angers with a new partner Julien Bessonneau. However, the outstanding production order would ultimately be cancelled, causing fatal economic hardship for both companies. However, the company's fortune quickly reversed following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that marked the end of the conflict. Without a major ongoing war driving demand, peace quickly led to a major downturn in the sale and production of aircraft, pushing many aviation companies to the brink. The French Government's aircraft manufacturing department allegedly lacked interest in providing support to any of the nation's manufacturers. Accordingly, many companies and individuals alike decided to withdraw from the aviation sector during the late 1910s and early 1920s in favour of other endeavours. SEA was wound up shortly after the conflict's end. However, Potez and Bloch went on to found their own separate and highly successful companies shortly thereafter.

'The Monk Who Gave Up Acting With Laurence Olivier To Lead Buddhism In British Prisons'. HuffPost, 25 November. In 1971, after training at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and Drama Centre, London and practising as a professional actor, working for several years at the Royal National Theatre in London with Laurence Olivier, he travelled to Thailand via the Buddhist holy places in India. In December 1971 in Bangkok he became a novice monk and about a month later moved to Ubon to stay with Ajahn Chah at Wat Nong Pah Pong. On the day before Vesakha Puja of that year, 1972, he received upasampada as a bhikkhu, a fully ordained Buddhist monk. In 1977, Khemadhammo returned to the UK with Ajahn Chah and stayed with him during his two-month visit at the old Hampstead Vihara. After Ajahn Chah's return to Thailand, Ajahn Khemadhammo remained at Hampstead and eighteen months later set up a small monastery on the Isle of Wight. In 1984, at the invitation of a group of Buddhist meditators that he had been visiting monthly for some years, he moved to Banner Hill near Kenilworth and formed the Buddha-Dhamma Fellowship. In 1985, he moved to his current residence, the Forest Hermitage, a property in Warwickshire; in 1987, with considerable help from devotees in Thailand, this land was purchased by the Buddha-Dhamma Fellowship. A stupa was built there in 1988 by Sayadaw U Thilawunta, known as the 'English Shwe Dagon'. Khemadhammo began Buddhist prison chaplaincy work in 1977. In 1985, with the help of others, Angulimala, the Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy, was launched with him as its Spiritual Director. Currently, Luang Por Khemadhammo continues to visit prisons and teach meditation both at his monastery and at Warwick University.

In other words, bathymetry is the underwater equivalent to hypsometry or topography. The name comes from Greek Œ≤Œ±Œ∏œçœÇ (bathus), \\"deep\\",Œ≤Œ±Œ∏œçœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅŒøŒΩ (metron), \\"measure\\".ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅŒøŒΩ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, on Perseus Bathymetric (or hydrographic) charts are typically produced to support safety of surface or sub-surface navigation, and usually show seafloor relief or terrain as contour lines (called depth contours or isobaths) and selected depths (soundings), and typically also provide surface navigational information. Bathymetric maps (a more general term where navigational safety is not a concern) may also use a Digital Terrain Model and artificial illumination techniques to illustrate the depths being portrayed. The global bathymetry is sometimes combined with topography data to yield a Global Relief Model. Paleobathymetry is the study of past underwater depths. Measurement USS Dolphin (1853). Originally, bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean depth through depth sounding. Early techniques used pre- measured heavy rope or cable lowered over a ship's side. This technique measures the depth only a singular point at a time, and is therefore inefficient. It is also subject to movements of the ship and currents moving the line out of true and therefore is not accurate. The data used to make bathymetric maps today typically comes from an echosounder (sonar) mounted beneath or over the side of a boat, \\"pinging\\" a beam of sound downward at the seafloor or from remote sensing LIDAR or LADAR systems. The amount of time it takes for the sound or light to travel through the water, bounce off the seafloor, and return to the sounder informs the equipment of the distance to the seafloor. LIDAR/LADAR surveys are usually conducted by airborne systems. The seafloor topography near the Puerto Rico Trench Present day Earth bathymetry (and altimetry). Data from the National Centers for Environmental Information's TerrainBase Digital Terrain Model. Starting in the early 1930s, single-beam sounders were used to make bathymetry maps. Today, multibeam echosounders (MBES) are typically used, which use hundreds of very narrow adjacent beams arranged in a fan-like swath of typically 90 to 170 degrees across. The tightly packed array of narrow individual beams provides very high angular resolution and accuracy. In general, a wide swath, which is depth dependent, allows a boat to map more seafloor in less time than a single-beam echosounder by making fewer passes. The beams update many times per second (typically 0.1‚Äì50 Hz depending on water depth), allowing faster boat speed while maintaining 100% coverage of the seafloor. Attitude sensors allow for the correction of the boat's roll and pitch on the ocean surface, and a gyrocompass provides accurate heading information to correct for vessel yaw. (Most modern MBES systems use an integrated motion-sensor and position system that measures yaw as well as the other dynamics and position.) A boat-mounted Global Positioning System (GPS) (or other Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)) positions the soundings with respect to the surface of the earth. Sound speed profiles (speed of sound in water as a function of depth) of the water column correct for refraction or \\"ray-bending\\" of the sound waves owing to non-uniform water column characteristics such as temperature, conductivity, and pressure. A computer system processes all the data, correcting for all of the above factors as well as for the angle of each individual beam. The resulting sounding measurements are then processed either manually, semi- automatically or automatically (in limited circumstances) to produce a map of the area. a number of different outputs are generated, including a sub-set of the original measurements that satisfy some conditions (e.g., most representative likely soundings, shallowest in a region, etc.) or integrated Digital Terrain Models (DTM) (e.g., a regular or irregular grid of points connected into a surface). Historically, selection of measurements was more common in hydrographic applications while DTM construction was used for engineering surveys, geology, flow modeling, etc. Since ca. 2003‚Äì2005, DTMs have become more accepted in hydrographic practice. Satellites are also used to measure bathymetry. Satellite radar maps deep-sea topography by detecting the subtle variations in sea level caused by the gravitational pull of undersea mountains, ridges, and other masses. On average, sea level is higher over mountains and ridges than over abyssal plains and trenches. In the United States the United States Army Corps of Engineers performs or commissions most surveys of navigable inland waterways, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) performs the same role for ocean waterways. Coastal bathymetry data is available from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC),NCEI-Bathymetry & Relief which is now merged into National Centers for Environmental Information. Bathymetric data is usually referenced to tidal vertical datums.NCEI -Coastal relief models For deep-water bathymetry, this is typically Mean Sea Level (MSL), but most data used for nautical charting is referenced to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) in American surveys, and Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) in other countries. Many other datums are used in practice, depending on the locality and tidal regime. Occupations or careers related to bathymetry include the study of oceans and rocks and minerals on the ocean floor, and the study of underwater earthquakes or volcanoes. The taking and analysis of bathymetric measurements is one of the core areas of modern hydrography, and a fundamental component in ensuring the safe transport of goods worldwide.

The hypothesis is derived from the discipline of social psychology and was first proposed by American social psychologist Elaine Hatfield and her colleagues in 1966.Walster, E., Aronson, V., Abrahams, D., & Rottman, L. (1966). Importance of physical attractiveness in dating behavior. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 4(5), 508-516. Successful couples of differing physical attractiveness may be together due to other matching variables that compensate for the difference in attractiveness. For instance, some men with wealth and status desire younger, more attractive women. Some women are more likely to overlook physical attractiveness for men who possess wealth and status. It is also similar to some of the theorems outlined in uncertainty reduction theory, from the post-positivist discipline of communication studies. These theorems include constructs of nonverbal expression, perceived similarity, liking, information seeking, and intimacy, and their correlations to one another.  Research  = Walster et al. (1966) = Walster advertised a \\"Computer Match Dance\\". 752 student participants were rated on physical attractiveness by four independent judges, as a measure of social desirability. Participants were told to fill in a questionnaire for the purposes of computer matching based on similarity. Instead, participants were randomly paired, except no man was paired with a taller woman. During an intermission of the dance, participants were asked to assess their date. People with higher ratings were found to have more harsh judgment of their dates. Furthermore, higher levels of attractiveness indicated lower levels of satisfaction with their pairing, even when they were on the same level. It was also found that both men and women were more satisfied with their dates if their dates had high levels of attractiveness. Physical attractiveness was found to be the most important factor in enjoying the date and whether or not they would sleep with them when propositioned. It was more important than intelligence and personality. One criticism Walster assigned to the study was that the four judges who assigned the attractiveness ratings to the participants had very brief interactions with them. Longer exposure may have changed the attraction ratings. In a follow up of the experiment, it was found that couples were more likely to continue interacting if they held similar attraction ratings. = Walster and Walster (1969) = Walster and Walster ran a follow up to the Computer Dance, but instead allowed participants to meet beforehand in order to give them greater chance to interact and think about their ideal qualities in a partner. The study had greater ecological validity than the original study, and the finding was that partners that were similar in terms of physical attractiveness expressed the most liking for each other ‚Äì a finding that supports the matching hypothesis. = Murstein (1972) = Murstein also found evidence that supported the matching hypothesis. Photos of 197 couples in various statuses of relationship (from casually dating to married), were rated in terms of attractiveness by eight judges. Each person was photographed separately. The judges did not know which photographs went together within romantic partnerships. The ratings from the judges supported the matching hypothesis. Self-perception and perception of the partner were included in the first round of the study; however, in the later rounds they were removed, as partners not only rated themselves unrealistically high, but their partners even higher. = Huston (1973) = Huston argued that the evidence for the matching hypothesis didn't come from matching but instead on the tendency of people to avoid rejection hence choosing someone similarly attractive to themselves, to avoid being rejected by someone more attractive than themselves. Huston attempted to prove this by showing participants photos of people who had already indicated that they would accept the participant as a partner. The participant usually chose the person rated as most attractive; however, the study has very flawed ecological validity as the relationship was certain, and in real life people wouldn't be certain hence are still more likely to choose someone of equal attractiveness to avoid possible rejection. = White (1980)= White conducted a study on 123 dating couples at UCLA. He stated that good physical matches may be conducive to good relationships. The study reported that partners most similar in physical attractiveness were found to rate themselves happier and report deeper feelings of love. The study also supported that some, especially men, view relationships as a marketplace. If the partnership is weak, an individual may devalue it if they have many friends of the opposite sex who are more attractive. They may look at the situation as having more options present that are more appealing. At the same time, if the relationship is strong, they may value the relationship more because they are passing up on these opportunities in order to remain in the relationship. = Brown (1986) = Brown argued for the matching hypothesis, but maintained that it results from a learned sense of what is \\"fitting\\" ‚Äì we adjust our expectation of a partner in line with what we believe we have to offer others, instead of a fear of rejection. = Garcia and Khersonsky (1996)= Garcia and Khersonsky studied this effect and how others view matching and non-matching couples. Participants viewed photos of couples who matched or did not match in physical attractiveness and completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire included ratings of how satisfied the couples appear in their current relationship, their potential marital satisfaction, how likely is it that they will break up and how likely it is that they will be good parents. Results showed that the attractive couple was rated as currently more satisfied than the non-matching couple, where the male was more attractive than the female. Additionally, the unattractive male was rated as more satisfied (currently and marital) than the attractive female in the non-matching couple. The attractive woman was also rated as more satisfied (currently and marital) in the attractive couple. = Shaw Taylor et al. (2011) = Shaw Taylor performed a series of studies involving the matching hypothesis in online dating. In one of the studies, the attractiveness of 60 males and 60 females were measured and their interactions were monitored. The people with whom they interacted were then monitored to see who they interacted with, and returned messages to. What they found was different from the original construct of matching. People contacted others who were significantly more attractive than they were. However it was found that the person was more likely to reply if they were closer to the same level of attractiveness. This study supported matching but not as something that is intentional. = Other studies = Further evidence supporting the matching hypothesis was found by: *Berscheid and Dion (1974) *Berscheid and Walster et al.

They traditionally live on the southern and eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru\\"Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia, authored by John A. Shoup, ABC-CLIO, 2011, page 67 and near Moshi. Their relative wealth comes from the favorable climate of the area and successful agricultural methods, which include extensive irrigation systems, terracing, and continuous organic fertilization methods practiced for thousands of years. They were one of the first tribes in the area to convert to Christianity. This may have given them an economic advantage over other ethnic groups, as they had better access to education and health care as Christians. The Chaga descended from various Bantu groups who migrated from elsewhere in Africa to the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, a migration that began around the start of the eleventh century. While the Chaga are Bantu-speakers, their language has a number of dialects related to Kamba, which is spoken in southeast Kenya, and to other languages spoken in the east, such as Taita and Pokomo. They are culturally related to the Pare, Taveta, and Taita peoples. The inhabitants reveal migration occurred back and forth throughout the history of these groups, and the Chaga people should be viewed as a part of the bigger population inhabiting the entire Kilimanjaro Corridor. The Chaga area is traditionally divided into a number of chiefdoms. They follow a patrilineal system of descent and inheritance. Their way of life is based primarily on agriculture, using irrigation on terraced fields and oxen manure. Although bananas are their staple food, they also cultivate various crops, including yams, beans, and maize. In agricultural exports, they are best known for their Arabica coffee, which is exported to American and European markets, resulting in coffee being a primary cash crop. Early history =Identification and location= In the nineteenth century the Kichagga-speaking people on Mount Kilimanjaro were divided into many small, autonomous chiefdoms. Early accounts frequently identify the inhabitants of each chiefdom as a separate \\"tribe.\\" Although the Chaga are principally located on Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, numerous families have migrated elsewhere over the course of the twentieth century. =Demography= Around the beginning of the twentieth century, the German colonial government estimated that there were about 28,000 households on Kilimanjaro. The 1988 Tanzanian census counted 744,271 individuals. (With very few exceptions, only Chaga live on Kilimanjaro.) Obviously, the mountain population has increased at a rapid rate during the twentieth century, and the high rate of increase seems to be continuing. =Cultural relations= Bantu peoples came to Kilimanjaro in a succession of migrations that started at least five or six hundred years ago. It is likely that there were other peoples on the mountain for hundreds of years before they arrived. Reliable written historical accounts of the Chaga date from the nineteenth century. The first European to reach the mountain was a missionary, Johannes Rebmann, who arrived there in 1848. At that time, Rebmann found that Kilimanjaro was so actively involved in far-reaching trading connections that a chief whose court he visited had a coastal Swahili resident in his entourage. Chaga chiefdoms traded with each other, with the peoples of the regions immediately surrounding the mountain (such as the Kamba, the Maasai, and the Pare), and also with coastal caravans. Some of this trading was hand to hand, some of it at markets, which were a general feature of the area. Many chiefdoms had several produce markets largely run by women, just as they are today. As far back into local history as the accounts go, Chaga chiefdoms were chronically at war with one another and with nearby peoples. Various alliances and consolidations were achieved through conquest, others through diplomacy, but the resulting political units were not always durable. Alignments changed and were reorganized with the ebb and flow of the fortunes of war and trade. Presumably, the fighting between the chiefdoms was over control of trade routes, over monopolies on the provisioning of caravans, over ivory, slaves, cattle, iron, and other booty of war, and over the right to exact tribute. Outlines of the process are known from the eighteenth century onward. As large as some of the blocs of allies became, at no time in the precolonial period did any one chiefdom rule all the others. That unitary consolidation was not achieved until the German colonial government imposed it. Initially (i.e., before the German conquest), various Chaga chiefdoms welcomed missionaries, travelers, and foreign representatives as they did traders; in the 1880s, however, when the Chaga gradually lost their autonomy, they became more hostile. In 1886 Germany and Britain divided their spheres of influence in East Africa; Kilimanjaro was allocated to the Germans. Some Chaga chiefs became German allies and helped the Germans to defeat old rivals in other Chaga chiefdoms. Sudanese and Zulu troops were also brought in when some strong chiefly resistance to German control manifested itself. By the 1890s, all the Chaga had been subjugated. Chaga society experienced a radical change. Taxes in cash were imposed to force Africans to work for Europeans from whom they could receive wages. A native system of corv√©e was expanded for the benefit of the colonial government. A handful of armed Germans successfully ruled a hundred thousand Chaga by controlling them through their chiefs. The chiefs who cooperated were rewarded with more power than they had ever known. The resisting chiefs were deposed or hanged, and more malleable substitutes were appointed in their stead. Warfare came to an end and, with it, Chaga military organization, which had been a system of male age grades. Christianity spread, and, eventually, most Chaga became, at least nominally, Christians. The churches, Catholic and Lutheran, were allocated religious control over different parts of Kilimanjaro. As part of their mission, they introduced schools and coffee-growing clinics. These developments parallel the major political reorganization effectuated by colonization and the fundamental change in the local economy. Long-distance trade became a European monopoly. Coffee growing spread rapidly over the mountain. This general economic transformation was well under way when the colonial government passed from German hands into those of the British in 1916. Arabica coffee remains a major cash crop produced locally. Since 1961, Tanzania has been an independent nation and, among other products, relies on coffee exportation for foreign exchange. =Settlements= There are no nucleated villages on Kilimanjaro. Each household lives in the midst of its own banana-coffee garden, and the gardens, one next to another, stretch all over the lower slopes of the mountain. The gardens are, for the most part, ringed with living fences that mark their boundaries. In the older areas of settlement, male kin tend to own and reside in contiguous homestead gardens, forming localized patrilineal clusters. Because of the enormous expansion of the population and the consequent land shortage, there are no large expanses of uncultivated or unoccupied land in the banana belt. It was otherwise in earlier times. Photographs and accounts from earlier in the twentieth century show that there were open fields between the localized clusters. Such residential arrangements were not static. A household, or several together, could break away from the localized patrilineage of which they had been members. There being no land shortage, they could, with the consent of the local chief or district head in the new location, establish themselves elsewhere and even found a new patrilineal cluster. As available land became more scarce, many households moved downmountain, and some moved up, pushing back the boundary of the forest. Thus, there are older and newer settlements on the mountain, older and newer patrilineal clusters, and substantial areas where the majority of residents are from unrelated households. Gradually, as the open land has filled up, the mobility of households has been increasingly restricted. Early migration patterns of the Niger‚ÄìCongo Bantus led the Chaga to settle in the north Pare Mountains. This is the home of the ancestral Chaga. Their population growth by about the eleventh or twelfth century led a number of people to begin looking for new lands. They found it on the nearby and, in those days, still heavily forested southern and eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The movement of the early Chaga banana farmers to Kilimanjaro set off a period of rapid and extensive cultural amalgamation, in which large numbers of the Ongamo people and the Rift Southern Cushites were assimilated into the newly expanding Chaga communities. Even though the Maasai settled in the open plains around much of the Chaga country, they cannot be credited with great influence on Chaga affairs during this period. Another people, the Ongamo or Ngasa who were closely related in language to the Maasai, did have much influence on Chaga history. Although growing in numbers and territory, the Chaga in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries remained organised into many very small and local social and political units. Ngata for protecting the head when carrying bananas Interactions with other ethnic groups The Chaga have unique traditions compared with other tribes found in Tanzania. =Influences of other peoples= The Chaga's success in farming the highlands ensured that new communities spoke the Chaga language. These communities initially took the form of villages built along highland ridges. This custom apparently preserved an old practice coming from the Kaskazi and Upland Bantu side of their ancestry. The Chaga also circumcised boys and initiated them into age-sets of the typical old Bantu type. At the same time, they adopted from the Southern Cushitic side of their ancestry the practice of female clitoridectomy, which they stopped after adopting Christianity or Islam. =Interactions with the Ongamo= The beginnings of Chaga interactions with the Nilotic Ongamo date well before 1600, and at some point the Ongamo had been the dominant people through much of the Mount Kilimanjaro area. The Ongamo had a large effect on Chaga culture. They borrowed several practices from them, including female circumcision, the drinking of cattle blood, and age sets. By the second half of the nineteenth century, the Ongamo were increasingly acculturated into the Chaga. The Chaga god \\"Ruwa\\" resulted from the combination of the Chaga's concept of a creator god with the Ongamo's concept of the life giving sun. A Chagan cave (modified) to hide during tribal wars =Interactions with the Pare and foreigners= The Pare, Taveta, and Taita peoples had been the chief suppliers of iron to the Chaga. The demand for iron increased from the beginning of the nineteenth century because of military rivalries among the Chaga rulers. It is likely that there was a connection between this rivalry and the development of long distance trade from the coast to the interior of the Pangani River basin, suggesting the Chaga's contacts with the coast may have dated to about the end of the eighteenth century. Raids and counter raids characterised the Chaga rivalry, as observed and understood by European colonisers.  Early religion  Before the arrival of Christianity, the Chaga practiced a diverse range of faith with a thoroughgoing syncretism. The importance of ancestors is strongly maintained by them to this day. The name of the chief Chaga deity is Ruwa who resides on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, which is sacred to them. Parts of the high forest contain old shrines with masale plantings, the sacred Chaga plant. Chieftains Chaga suprime council during Colonial Era Chaga chieftainship appears to have been very specific with no influence from early ancestors, according to western observations done in the nineteenth century. In the nearby north Pare Mountains area of Ugweno, the chieftainship system appears similar. However, in the south Pare Mountains, the old clan chieftainship of the Mashariki continued to be the ritual center of life among the early Asu and remained so, in fact, down through the nineteenth century. But among the ancestral Chaga of north Pare and among their descendants who settled around Mount Kilimanjaro, a new kind of chiefship, Mangi, probably originally meaning \\"the arranger, planner\\" came into being not much before 1000 AD. =Economics, politics and Mangi rule= The current Chaga population is estimated at about . The Chagas are arguably one of the most economically successful people in East Africa. Unlike many societies in Africa, the Chaga women take the forefront positions of the Chaga society; from economical issues, to education. Chaga women stimulate a large part of the economical progressions in northern Tanzania. The Mangi were great chiefs that governed largely clan- based states and controlled Chaga affairs even during colonial times. Although Mangis are not as prevalent at the present, the term 'Mangi' still rules and stands as the most respectable identity to most young and adult Chaga men. =Mangi Sina and Mangi Rindi= The Mangi Sina and the Mangi Rindi had by the end of the nineteenth century developed large armies. When the Germans arrived in the 1880s and imposed colonial rule, they sided with Rindi to defeat Sina. Rindi had already negotiated and signed a treaty with the Germans in 1885, resulting in Moshi becoming their colonial capital. =Mangi Mkuu= Goat barn / kiriwa kya mburu In 1952, the Chaga held an election to elect Mangi Mkuu, the \\"Paramount Chief\\", to look after their affairs and speak with colonial administrators on their behalf. Thomas Marealle of Marangu won the election, defeating divisional chiefs M. H. Abdiel Shangali of Hai and John Ndaskoi Maruma of Rombo. Another divisional chief, Petro Itosi Marealle of Vunjo, withdrew from consideration before the election. Marealle consolidated power from the other three divisional chieftains, thus making the Chaga more powerful and in control of their own affairs. His capital was in Marangu. But Marealle's downfall occurred during Tanganyika's struggle for independence, for two main reasons: *First, He lost support among western educated people. When Chaga students at Makerere University criticized him in their college magazine, he publicly humbled them when they came home, in an \\"old\\" tribal way. He placed his faith in Petro Njau, the elderly astute party organizer who had put him in. From 1958 Njau set himself the task of enlisting the support of the old conservatives and the clan elders. This was a spurious return to the great tribal past. But Mangi Mkuu believed and trusted implicitly in him, and in the exaggerated accounts of popularity which Njau reported. *Second, Mangi Mkuu crossed swords with T.A.N.U on his home ground of Kilimanjaro. He still supported the national aims of T.A.N.U for Tanganyika. He continued to support Julius Nyerere personally, as the national leader long after he had begun to deal summarily with local T.A.N.U critics at home, perhaps because these critics did not need to be taken seriously, since they were insignificantly unrepresentative of the people. In 1957-58 the British Administration were belatedly trying to organize a council of Chiefs in Tanganyika as a delaying action against T.A.N.U, Mangi Mkuu wrote the governor asking that Nyerere himself should be invited to address the chiefs. The request was refused. It was not until 1959, when he was fighting for his political life, that Mangi Mkuu cut across Nyerere personally and cut across the national movement as such. In , by which time he was sharply on the defensive at home, Mangi Mkuu criticized Nyerere's visit to Moshi to hold an open-air TANU meeting in the town. A few months later he circularized the chiefs on the mountain, threatening to sack them if they supported TANU. In the local field of Chaga politics, however the break came earlier. It did not come from TANU branches as such which, though they had started in 1955 on the mountain, had made little headway among the people. It came from Machame, from the chiefly rival whom Mangi Mkuu had supplanted in 1951. Chief Abdieli Shangali threw the weight of his authority behind his son-in-law, Solomon Eliufoo, and this was the decisive factor. Eliufoo, a commoner from one of the oldest clans in Machame, and a Lutheran-trained teacher, was abroad in the United States and Great Britain from 1953 to 1956. In 1957, he returned as a teacher and joined the TANU branch in Machame. In 1958, he entered politics; he became a nominated member of the Chagga Council, being nominated by Hai divisional council of which his father-in-law, Chief Abdieli Shangali, was chairman. The same year, he was elected member of the legislative council in Dar es Salaam on the TANU ticket. From 1958 onwards, he was engaged in central politics becoming minister of health from 1959 to 1960, and in 1962 minister of education, a post which he held up to 1967. At the local level, he organised and led opposition to the Mangi Mkuu and by 1959 he called for the resignation or abdication of the Mangi Mkuu and the democratization for the local governments, forming a new party called the Chaga Democratic Party. Towards the end of 1959, the opposition of the Chaga Democratic party forced a deadlock in the Chagga Council. A vote was taken in the council as to whether a referendum should be held on Kilimanjaro to decide whether the Chaga wanted a Paramount Chief for life or a periodically elected president. The vote was carried by a narrow majority, and the Mangi Mkuu was abolished. After independence, through Nyerere's socialism and integration policies, the rule of chiefs, was diminished.  Daily life and culture  Mbege a traditional Chaga brew Because fish are absent from most of the streams of the Kilimanjaro foothills, fish were not traditionally consumed and were seen as having the same nature as serpents, which were considered unfriendly in Chaga culture. The Chaga people bred fowl in large numbers, to sell to the passing caravans of traders from the east coast. The Chaga, like many east African communities, value oxen, goats, and sheep. Dogs are used to help guard compounds from intruders at night. The prized cattle is the humped Zebu breed prevalent throughout east Africa since the days of Ancient Egyptians. Goats are small and handsome with small horns. Milk is an essential part of Chaga diet. Among the Chaga, the plants grown for food are maize, sweet potatoes, yams, alliums, beans, peas, red millet and bananas. =Traditional foods= Chaga people have their traditional food according to food crops they grow in their region. Most of food among Chaga people are made by banana; an example is machalari, which is most favorite food among Chaga. Machalari is prepared with banana and meat, while other traditional food includes kiburu (Banana and Beans), Kitawa (Banana and sour milk, porridge-like), mtori (Meat with banana, like porridge, mainly food for a few days after birth), mlaso, ngararimo, kisusio (soup with Blood), kimamtine and others of the like, according to nature of crops and animals on the Chaga land. =Cultural heritage= Traditional Chaga instruments include wooden flutes, bells, and drums. Dancing and singing are part of almost every celebration. Classical Chagan music is still heard in festivities; however, Chagan youth have also embraced Kiswahili songs produced by various Tanzanian bands and west and central African music and dance forms. Reggae, pop, and rap are popular with the youth. Many musicians of Chaga origin are known around Africa. The first Chaga historian was Nathaniel Mtui, who was born in 1892 and wrote nine books about the history of the Chaga from 1913-1916. = Folklore = Chaga legends center on Ruwa and his power and assistance. Ruwa is the Chaga name for their god, as well as the Chaga word for \\"sun.\\" Ruwa is not looked upon as the creator of humankind, but rather as a liberator and provider of sustenance. He is known for his mercy and tolerance when sought by his people. Some Chaga myths concerning Ruwa resemble biblical stories of the Old Testament. In the past, chiefdoms had chiefs who rose to power through war and trading. Some famous past chiefs include Orombo from Kishigonyi, Sina of Kibosho, and Marealle of Marangu. =Employment= Traditionally, Chaga work has been centered on the farm and is divided by gender. Men's work includes feeding goats, building and maintaining canals, preparing fields, slaughtering animals, and building houses. Women's work includes firewood and water collection, fodder cutting, cooking, and cleaning the homestead and stalls. Women are also in charge of trading in the marketplace. Many young Chaga work as clerks, teachers, and administrators, and many engage in small-scale business activities. Women in rural areas are also generating income through activities such as crafts and tailoring. The Chaga are known for their sense of enterprise and strong work ethic. =Cuisine= Various Chaga Dishes The staple food of the Chaga people is bananas. Bananas are also used to make beer, their main beverage. The Chaga plant a variety of food crops, including bananas, millet, maize (corn), beans, and cassava. They also keep cattle, goats, and sheep. Due to limited land holdings and grazing areas, most Chaga people today purchase meat from butcher shops. Modern history They once lived under the rule of the Mangi Mkuu, even though they are not as organised as they used to be, and the Mangi is not involved in the day-to-day activities and life of the modern Chaga. The Mangis are still respected by the Chaga. The Paramount chief (chief of all chiefs) is Mangi Marealle. The Chaga are now modern wage earners in large modernised cities or abroad and entrepreneurs in the tourism industry around Kilimanjaro and Arusha areas. The Chaga still hold onto some of their traditions, like the \\"kihamba\\", which is a family plot of land usually passed down from one generation to another. Coffee is the primary cash crop for many Chaga people after its introduction to the area in the late nineteenth century, although bananas and maize are also staples. The Chaga are also famous for a traditional brew known as mbege. It is made from a special variety of bananas and millet.

In 1978, Ozgan became first secretary of the Gudauta Raikom of the Communist Party (a post he held until 1989) and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian ASSR and deputy head of its Presidium. In 1987, Ozgan became Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, a ceremonial function. According to Anri Jergenia, in 1989, the Central Committee of the Georgian SSR tried to nominate Ozgan, who enjoyed popularity, for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to thwart the election of Vladislav Ardzinba. However, Ozgan refused to be nominated. In 1990, Ozgan resigned as Supreme Soviet Chairman to make way for Ardzinba, because the Presidium had been abolished and it had become the most important office. He has been accused by Georgian intellectuals of being responsible for the July 1989 clashes in Sukhumi, in which 25 people died. From 1991 until 1996, Ozgan was a member of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia.  Minister for Foreign Affairs  Konstantin Ozgan rose to the position of Abkhazian foreign minister in 1996, when his predecessor Leonid Lakerbaia resigned. He handled much of the early negotiations with the United Nations. He met then Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze multiple times, as part of a regular series of negotiations during his two years in office. As one of the entity's more moderate leaders, he once proposed a five-year moratorium on discussions of Abkhazia's future political status as an interim compromise, in a similar fashion to the deal Russia had at that time with Chechnya. While this was the closest the two sides had come to agreement, it was rejected by the Georgian side. In the earlier stages of Ozgan's term, he had overseen some of the more successful negotiations between the two sides. However, in 1997, tensions began to rise again. Ozgan accused the Georgian government of being behind terrorist attacks on Abkhaz soldiers. He also demanded that the Commonwealth of Independent States lift sanctions before any Georgian refugees could return to their homes - a policy which has since continued under his successors. Vice Premier and Minister for the Economy After being replaced as foreign minister, Ozgan was appointed Vice Premier of Abkhazia and minister for the Economy. In 1999, he headed the Abkhaz commission that was to oversee the unilateral repatriation to the Gali district of ethnic Georgian displaced persons. On April 2, 1999, Ozgan survived an assassination attempt when four colleagues were seriously injured by a landmine.  Deputy of Parliament  Though he no longer occupied as much of a public role as he once did, Ozgan remained a deputy in the People's Assembly of Abkhazia. He lost a 2002 bid for the position of speaker to Nugzar Ashuba, and became deputy speaker instead. Ozgan failed to be re-elected in the 2007 elections. Konstantin Ozgan joined the opposition movement against former President Vladislav Ardzinba, which in 2005 was successful in installing opposition candidate Sergei Bagapsh as President. One of his recent proposals was an unsuccessful attempt to have the segment of the Abkhaz constitution overturned that demanded that a presidential candidate have lived in Abkhazia for more than five years before running for office. Chairman of the Council of Elders On 31 July 2009 Konstantin Ozgan was chosen by the Council of Elders of Abkhazia to succeed outgoing chairman Pavel Adzynba. Adzynba had asked to be allowed to step down after heading the council for 16 years. On 21 March 2016, in response to a planned recall referendum, Ozgan on behalf of the Council of the Elders called upon government and opposition to form a coalition government instead. Death Konstantin Ozgan died on 22 March 2016. On 25 March, Ozgan was posthumously awarded the Order of Leon by President Raul Khajimba.

Like nearby Franz Josef Glacier, Fox Glacier is one of the most accessible glaciers in the world, with a terminal face as low as 300 m above sea level, close to Fox Glacier village / Weheka. It is a major tourist attraction and about 1000 people daily visit it during high tourist season.  Naming  The glacier was known by local MƒÅori as Te Moeka o Tuawe ('The bed of Tuawe;). According to oral tradition, Hine Hukatere loved climbing in the mountains and persuaded her lover Tuawe to climb with her. Tuawe was a less experienced climber than Hine Hukatere but loved to accompany her, until an avalanche swept him from the peaks to his death. Hine Hukatere was broken- hearted and her many, many tears flowed down the mountain. Rangi the Sky Father took pity on her and froze them to form the glacier now known as Franz Josef; the glacier now known as Fox marks Tuawe's resting place. In 1857 local MƒÅori led PƒÅkehƒÅ Leonard Harper and Edwin Fox to both glaciers, the first Europeans to see them. In 1865, German geologist Julius von Haast was the first to explore and survey the glaciers at the head of this valley, and named them Victoria and Albert, after the queen and her consort. The Victoria Glacier kept its name, but the lower part of the Albert Glacier was renamed in 1872 after a visit by then Premier of New Zealand Sir William Fox. Explorer Charlie Douglas had already visited the glacier himself in the 1860s, looking for a cow. \\"In those ancient days i did not pay much attention to the glaciers,\\" he later wrote. With the passage of the NgƒÅi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the glacier's name changed once again to Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe.  Geography  Fox River valley downstream from the glacier Fed by four alpine glaciers, Fox Glacier descends on its 13 km journey from the Southern Alps towards the coast, finishing near rainforest above sea level. After retreating for most of the previous 100 years, it advanced between 1985 and 2009. In 2006, the average rate of advance was about a metre a week. In January 2009, the terminal face of the glacier was still advancing and its vertical or overhanging faces regularly collapsed. Since then there has been a significant retreat, with the 2009 high level clearly visible as vegetation line on the southern slope above what is left of the lower glacier today. The outflow of the glacier forms the Fox River. During the last ice age, its ice reached beyond the present coastline, and the glacier left behind many moraines during its retreat. Lake Matheson formed as a kettle lake within one of these.Fox Glacier area (from the DOC website.

He also noted the road between the farming settlement of Weheka at Fox Glacier and Waiho to the north (now Franz Josef) was very poor. \\"‚Ä¶when I came through that way, I left the track and took to the bush as being far better walking.\\" By 1903 it had been improved and Dr Ebenezer Teichelmann described it as a good horse track. Tour group in 1966 Douglas had previously surveyed the glacier with A.P. Harper and William Wilson, and had built the first hut there, known as the iron hut, near the 1896 glacier terminal. In the 1920s Westland was being marketed as a tourist destination for the scenic vistas of its mountains, lakes and forests. Visitors to Weheka would stay in the Williams or Sullivan homesteads, until in 1928 the Sullivan brothers opened the first hotel in the valley, the 40-room Fox Glacier Hostel (which, expanded and refurbished several times over the years, is still operating as a hotel). Official glacier guiding began at this point, employing well-known mountaineers like Frank Alack, Harry Ayres, and Tom Christie. Access to the glacier was via a track along the north side of the Fox River valley and across a swingbridge. They could climb onto the ice at a lunch shelter at the Chalet Viewpoint, built in 1931 (and which burnt down in 1973). As the glacier retreated a gallery was built along the side of Cone Rock to allow access, until it retreated still further. Eventually the northern route became the main access road for tourists. Chancellor Hut today Chancellor Hut was built in 1930‚Äì31 on the southwest face of Chancellor Ridge, now 200 m above the glacier. Planned by mountain guides Alec and Peter Graham in 1929, all the materials had to be packed up Fox Glacier manually in 1930 in the days before helicopter airlifts. It is the oldest remaining mountain hut in the Southern Alps still on its original site, and is a Category II Historic Building on the Heritage New Zealand list. At an altitude of 1200 m, it was designed to provide climbing opportunities to tourists, rather than as a staging post for mountaineers climbing on the Great Divide. A hut was also built at on Craig's Peak () for overnight climbing trips. In the early 1930s and early 1940s roads were built up the northern and southern sides of the valley to improve access. The northern road led to main car park for tourists who wanted to walk up to the glacier face, although barriers and warning signs prevented them from entering the \\"danger zone\\" close to the active glacier face. Safety warnings were ignored, however, by up to one third of the 600,000 tourists a year visiting West Coast glaciers. Two Australian tourists were killed in January 2009 after they crossed safety barriers and walked 500 m to the terminal face to take photos. On 21 November 2015, seven people were killed when a Eurocopter √âcureuil (squirrel) helicopter operated by Alpine Adventures crashed on the glacier. On 26 March 2019 heavy rains caused flooding in the area, destroying the Waiho Bridge across State Highway 6 at Franz Josef. The rains also triggered an enormous landslide in the Fox River valley that washed away about 150 m of the northern glacier access road and destroyed the car park. The road had already been washed out several times in the previous year, and just two months previously it had been repaired at a cost of $430,000. The Alpine Gardens landslide comprises 50‚Äì70 million cubic metres of rock and is still active, moving 100‚Äì700 mm a day. The road has been closed indefinitely, with no practical solutions available for repairing it, and access to the glacier is now by helicopter. To compensate for the closure of the access road, a $3.9 million spending package was announced in August 2019 for other tourism projects around Fox Glacier: extending a cycleway to Lake Matheson, upgrading and reopening the track to Lake Gault, improving the road and track access on the south side of the Fox River valley, and reopening the coastal walkway to Galway Beach north of Gillespies Beach.

(ICF) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability. The ICF received approval from all 191 World Health Organization (WHO) member states on May 22, 2001, during the 54th World Health Assembly. Its approval followed nine years of international revision efforts coordinated by WHO. WHO's initial classification for the effects of diseases, the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH), was created in 1980. The ICF classification complements WHO's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD), which contains information on diagnosis and health condition, but not on functional status. The ICD and ICF constitute the core classifications in the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC). Overview The ICF is structured around the following broad components: * Body functions and structure * Activities (related to tasks and actions by an individual) and participation (involvement in a life situation) * Additional information on severity and environmental factors Functioning and disability are viewed as a complex interaction between the health condition of the individual and the contextual factors of the environment as well as personal factors. The picture produced by this combination of factors and dimensions is of \\"the person in his or her world\\". The classification treats these dimensions as interactive and dynamic rather than linear or static. It allows for an assessment of the degree of disability, although it is not a measurement instrument. It is applicable to all people, whatever their health condition. The language of the ICF is neutral as to etiology, placing the emphasis on function rather than condition or disease. It also is carefully designed to be relevant across cultures as well as age groups and genders, making it highly appropriate for heterogeneous populations.  Benefits  There are benefits of using the ICF for both the patient and the health professional. A major advantage for the patient is the integration of the physical, mental, and social aspects of his or her health condition. All aspects of a person's life (development, participation and environment) are incorporated into the ICF instead of solely focusing on his or her diagnosis. A diagnosis reveals little about one's functional abilities. Diagnoses are important for defining the cause and prognosis, but identifying the limitations of function is often the information used to plan and implement interventions. Once a rehabilitation team is aware of the daily activities a client is required to participate in, the problem solving sequence set up by the ICF can be utilized. An occupational therapist, for example, would observe a patient performing his or her daily activities and note the patient's functional abilities. This information would then be used to determine the extent to which the individual's abilities can be improved through therapy and to what extent the environment can be changed to facilitate the individual's performance. Intervention at one level (current abilities) has the potential to prevent or modify events at a succeeding level (participation). For example, teaching a deaf child manual signs will foster effective interaction and increase one's participation with his or her family. Rehabilitation therapists will be empowered with the ICF not only in their daily work with their patients, but also when working with other medical disciplines; hospitals and other health care administrations; health authorities and policy makers. All items are operationally defined with clear descriptions that can be applied to real life evaluations with clarity and ease. The language used in the ICF helps facilitate better communication between these groups of people.  Clinical relevance  Knowing how a disease affects one's functioning enables better planning of services, treatment, and rehabilitation for persons with long-term disabilities or chronic conditions. The current ICF creates a more integrative understanding of health forming a comprehensive profile of an individual instead of focusing on one's disease, illness, or disability. The implications of using the ICF include an emphasis on the strengths of individuals, assisting individuals in participating more extensively in society by the use of interventions aimed at enhancing their abilities, and taking into consideration the environmental and personal factors that might hamper their participation. Qualifiers: The ICF qualifiers ‚Äúmay be best translated clinically as the levels of functioning seen in a standardized or clinic setting and in everyday environments‚Äù. Qualifiers support standardization and the understanding of functioning in a multidisciplinary assessment. They enable all team members to quantify the extent of problems, even in areas of functioning where one is not a specialist. Without qualifiers codes have no inherent meaning. An impairment, limitation or restriction, is qualified from 0 (No problem; 0-4%), 1 (Mild problem: 5-24%), 2 (Moderate problem: 25-49%), 3 (Severe problem: 50-95%) to 4 (Complete problem: 96-100%). Environmental factors are quantified with a negative and positive scale denoting the extent to which the environment acts as a barrier or facilitator.World Health Organization. (2001). International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Geneva: Author. For insurance purposes, the qualifiers can describe the effectiveness of treatment. One can interpret the decreasing of a qualifier score to be an increase in the functional ability of a patient.  Core sets  An ICF Core Set can serve as a reference framework and a practical tool to classify and describe patient functioning in a more time efficient way. ICF Core Sets can be used along the continuum of care and over the course of a health condition. The ICF classification includes more than 1,400 categories limiting its use in clinical practice. It is time consuming for a clinician to utilize the main volume of the ICF with his or her patients. Only a fraction of the categories is needed. As a general rule, 20% of the codes will explain 80% of the variance observed in practice. ICF Core Sets contain as few as possible, but as many ICF categories as necessary, to describe a patient's level of functioning. It is hypothesized that using an ICF Core Set will increase the inter-rater reliability when coding clinical cases as only the relevant categories for a particular patient will be utilized. Since all of the relevant categories are listed in an ICF Core Set, its use in multidisciplinary assessments protects health professionals from missing important aspects of functioning.  Pediatric use  As clinicians and researchers used the ICF, they became more aware of its limitations. The ICF lacks the ability to classify the functional characteristics of a developing child. Different ICF codes are needed across the first years of a child's life to capture the growth and development of a disability even when the child's diagnosis does not change. The coding system can provide essential information about the severity of a health condition in terms of its impact on functioning. This can serve a significant role for providers caring for children with spectrum disorders such as autism or cerebral palsy. Children with these conditions may have the same diagnoses, but their abilities and levels of functioning widely vary across and within individuals over time. The first draft of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) was completed in year 2003 and published in 2007. The ICF-CY was developed to be structurally consistent with the ICF for adults. A major difference between the ICF-CY and ICF is that the generic qualifiers from the adult ICF now include developmental aspects for children and youth in the ICF-CY. Descriptions of codes in the ICF-CY were revised and expanded and new content was added to previously unused codes. Codes were added to document characteristics as adaptability, responsivity, predictability, persistence, and approachability. ‚ÄúSensing‚Äù and ‚Äúexploration of objects‚Äù codes were expanded as well as the ‚Äúimportance of learning‚Äù. Since a child's main occupation is playing, it is also important to include more codes in this area. Different levels of play have separate codes in the ICF-CY (solitary, onlooker, parallel). This contrasts with the adult ICF as only one code existed in regards to leisure or recreation. Changes in ICF-CY codes over time reflect developmental effects attributable to the child's interaction with the environment. Environmental factors influence functioning and development and can be documented as barriers or facilitators using the ICF- CY. The key environments of children and adolescents include their homes, day care centers, schools and recreation settings of playground, parks, and ball fields. Children will transition between different environments many times as they grow. For example, a child will transition into elementary or high school or from one service setting or agency to another. Attention to these transitions of children with disabilities has been identified as an important role for health care providers. A transition requires preparation and planning to find an appropriate and accommodating setting for a child's needs. With a coding system such as the ICF-CY, the transition will be smoother and interventions can start where the previous health provider left off.

Previously, the two had been part of comedy trio The Found Objects along with Scott Casley. Casley left and so Lano and Woodley debuted as a double-act in March 1993 at Melbourne's Prince Patrick Hotel. Their act features sketch comedy and slapstick theatre. Their television show The Adventures of Lano and Woodley aired on the ABC network in 1997 and 1999. In 1994, they won the Edinburgh Fringe Perrier Comedy Award. They have written one book, Housemeeting, published in 1996. Lano and Woodley reunited to tour nationally with a new show named Fly, begun in Canberra March 2018. Stage shows Their stage productions include Curtains, Fence, Glitzy, Slick, Bruiser, The Island and Goodbye - all original shows that they wrote and performed themselves. The show known as \\"Fence\\" was co-written and directed by Neill Gladwin who also directed \\"Curtains\\". =Bruiser= The show follows the adventures of Frank and Colin after a nasty confrontation at the local gym where Frank accidentally is challenged to a fight by the local strongman 'Bruiser'. Both Lano and Woodley alternate between playing themselves and the characters Bruiser and Juliet (the love interest) throughout the show through the use of costumes (at times forced to play each other as well). =The Island= In 2004 - 2005, the comedy duo took a tour across Australia called The Island. The show consisted of comedy sketches, songs and interaction with the audience, all based around them being stranded on a desert island. A stand-out feature of this performance was the one major set piece used: a motorised, revolving platform, which was used as a stairway, aeroplane, palm tree and court room stand. This performance has been released on DVD and is periodically screened on The Comedy Channel (Foxtel). =Goodbye= In February 2006, they announced their final tour, entitled Goodbye, after 20 years of performing together. The show premiered at the 2006 Adelaide Fringe Festival in March 2006 and was performed in 37 cities and towns across Australia, selling out at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in May 2006 where they filmed the show for DVD. This recorded performance, from the 6th of May, marked the first time they have ever wrestled an audience member to the ground. It also saw quite a few fumbles by the pair, because they were unnerved by the irregular lighting required for the audience to be seen on the DVD (house lights on the audience are usually dimmed). The show featured material from previous shows, as well as some new material. The last show of their Goodbye tour was performed on 11 November 2006 at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne. The DVD release received an ARIA nomination for best comedy release. The real reason for their goodbye, according to Colin Lane (stated both on stage and appearing on Andrew Denton's Enough Rope interview show), is summed up like this: \\"Imagine spending 20 years driving in a car with your best friend.\\" They have both stated that they are dissolving Lano and Woodley so that they do not end up hating each other five years down the track. Both have also expressed interest in exploring other careers. = Comeback & Fly = On 13 November 2017, Lano and Woodley announced they are reuniting and going on tour nationally with a new show named Fly, beginning in Canberra March 2018.  Television  Lano and Woodley created their own television show called The Adventures of Lano and Woodley which debuted on Australian TV on ABC in 1997 with the episode \\"The Girlfriend\\". In 2004, a 2-disc DVD was released, entitled The Complete Adventures of Lano and Woodley. In 2018, Lano and Woodley appeared as guest quiz masters on Have You Been Paying Attention?. Sing Songs October 2005 saw the release of Lano & Woodley Sing Songs, a CD recording of their live performance at the Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne as part of their Australian \\"Sing Songs\\" tour. The show consisted of songs that had been written and performed over the course of their career as a comedy duo. The CDs were sold at each of the touring venues, as well as in most music retail and department stores. Housemeeting Housemeeting, a book by Lano and Woodley, was published by Penguin Books in 1996, with illustrations by Woodley and a foreword by Andrew Denton. The story follows their conversations after Colin announces that after years of them living together, Frank has to move out. Throughout the book, Frank makes several desperate attempts to change Colin's mind, none of which seem to work. The story is written in the style of a script, with several chapters covering various subjects (e.g. nicknames, cooking, graffiti etc.) that Colin and Frank discuss (and argue about) as Frank prepares to move out. The style in which it is written is very self- referential and often breaks the fourth wall by talking directly to the reader, putting in deliberate spelling mistakes and filling pages with ellipses (or nothing at all). The book had an extremely limited print run of only 1,500 copies, and is hence rare and highly sought-after. Several regional libraries have had copies stolen. Copies have sold on eBay for upwards of $150. In 2018, the book has been reprinted with a new cover in celebration of the duo's comeback. Signed copies were sold at their Fly show across Australia.

It is an early attempt by the EEC to provide High-definition television (HDTV) in Europe. It is a complex mix of analogue signal (Multiplexed Analogue Components), multiplexed with digital sound, and assistance data for decoding (DATV). The video signal (1250 (1152 visible) lines/50 fields per second in 16:9 aspect ratio) was encoded with a modified D2-MAC encoder. HD-MAC could be decoded by standard D2-MAC receivers (SDTV), but in that mode only 625 (576) lines and certain artifacts were visible. To decode the signal in full resolution required a specific HD-MAC tuner.  Naming convention  The European Broadcasting Union video format description is as follows: width x height [scan type: i or p] / number of full frames per second As an example, the 1280√ó720p/60 format provides sixty 1280x720 pixel progressively scanned pictures each second. Lines are transmitted in the natural sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. European standard definition broadcasts use 720√ó576i/25, meaning 25 720 pixels wide and 576 pixels high interlaced frames: odd lines (1, 3, 5 ...) are grouped to build the odd field, which is transmitted first, then it is followed by the even field containing lines 2, 4, 6... Thus, there are two fields in a frame, resulting in a field frequency of 25 √ó 2 = 50 Hz. The visible part of the video signal provided by an HD-MAC receiver was 1152i/25, which exactly doubles the vertical resolution of standard definition. The amount of information is multiplied by 4, considering the encoder started its operations from a 1440x1152i/25 sampling grid.  Standard history  Work on HD-MAC specification started officially in May 1986. The purpose was to react against a Japanese proposal, supported by the US, which aimed to establish the NHK-designed system as a world standard. Besides preservation of the European electronic industry, there was also a need to produce a standard that would be compliant with the 50 Hz field frequency systems (used by a large majority of countries in the world). Truth be said, the precisely 60 Hz of the Japanese proposal was also worrying the US, as their NTSC M-based standard definition infrastructure used a practical frequency of 59.94 Hz. This apparently minor difference had the potential for a lot of trouble. In September, 1988, the Japanese performed the first High Definition broadcasts of the Olympic games, using their Hi-Vision system (NHK produced material using this format since 1982). In that same month of September, Europe showed for the first time a credible alternative, namely a complete HD-MAC broadcasting chain, at IBC 88 in Brighton. This show included the first progressive scan HD video camera prototypes (Thomson/LER).High Definition Television; the Creation, Development and Implementation of HDTV Technology, Philip J. Cianci For the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics and Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics, a public demonstration of HD-MAC broadcasting took place. 60 HD-MAC receivers for the Albertville games and 700 for the Barcelona games were set up in \\"Eurosites\\" to show the capabilities of the standard.http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_253-production.pdf HDTV programme production, 3. The Olympic Games 1250 lines (1152 visible) CRT video projectors were used to create an image a few meters wide. There were some Thomson \\"Space system\\" 16:9 CRT TV sets as well. The project sometimes used rear-projection televisions. In addition, some 80,000 viewers of D2-MAC receivers were also able to watch the channel (though not in HD). It is estimated that 350,000 people across Europe were able to see this demonstration of European HDTV. This project was financed by the EEC. The PAL- converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as SWR, BR and 3sat. The HD-MAC standard was also demonstrated at Seville Expo '92, exclusively using equipment designed to work with the standard such as Plumbicon and CCD cameras, direct view and rear projection CRT TVs, BCH-1000 Type B VTRs, single mode fiber optic cables, and Laserdisc players with their respective discs. Production equipment was visible to the public through windows.https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_254-tejerina.pdf Because UHF spare bandwidth was very scarce, HD-MAC was usable \\"de facto\\" only to cable and satellite providers,https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_253-analogue.pdf where their bandwidth was less constricted, similarly to Hi-Vision that was only broadcast by the NHK through a dedicated satellite channel called BShi. However, the standard never became popular among broadcasters. For all this, analogue HDTV could not replace conventional SDTV (terrestrial) PAL/SECAM, making HD-MAC sets unattractive to potential consumers. It was required that all high-powered satellite broadcasters use MAC from 1986. However, the launch of middle-powered satellites by SES and the use of PAL allowed broadcasters to bypass HD-MAC, reducing their transmission costs. HD-MAC (the high-definition variant of MAC) was left for transcontinental satellite links, however. The HD-MAC standard was abandoned in 1993, and since then all EU and EBU efforts have focused on the DVB system (Digital Video Broadcasting), which allows both SDTV and HDTV. This article about IFA 1993 provides a view of the project's status close to its end. It mentions \\"a special BBC compilation encoded in HD- MAC and replayed from a D1 Video Tape Recorder\\". Most probably it was a BRR instead, a device that used more modern digital compression to fit HD on a single D-1, and bore no relationship to HD-MAC. HD-MAC development was stopped alongside the EUREKA project in 1996, because picture quality was not deemed to be good enough, receiving TVs didn't have enough resolution, the 16:9 aspect ratio that would later become standard was seen as exotic, and receiving TVs weren't large enough, and those that were, were CRT TVs which made them extremely heavy.https://www.live-production.tv/case- studies/sports/brief-review-hdtv-europe-early-90%E2%80%99s.html  Technical details  thumb = Transmission = PAL/SECAM analogue SDTV broadcasts use 6-, 7- (VHF), or 8 MHz (UHF). The 819-line (system E) used 14 MHz wide VHF channels. For HD-MAC, the transmission medium must guarantee a baseband bandwidth of at least 11.14 MHz.ETSI specification of the D2-HDMAC/Packet system (ETS 300 352), section 4.1 This translates to a 12 MHz channel spacing in cable networks. The specification allows for 8 MHz channels, but in this case assistance data can no longer be correctly decoded, and it is only possible to extract a standard definition signal, using a D2-MAC receiver. For satellite broadcasting, due to FM modulation spectrum expansion, an entire satellite transponder would be used, resulting in 27 to 36 MHz of bandwidth.ETSI specification of the D2-HDMAC/Packet system (ETS 300 352), section 10.3 The situation is pretty much the same in analogue standard definition : a given transponder can only support one analogue channel. So from this point of view, going to HD does not represent an inconvenience. = Bandwidth reduction = BRE (Bandwidth Reduction Encoding) operation started with analogue HD video (even when the source was a digital recorder, it was reconverted to analogue to feed the encoderhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1989-13.pdf Quadriga, Specifications of the digital HDTV recorder). It was specified to have a 50 Hz field frequency. It could be interlaced, with 25 frames a second (called 1250/50/2 in the recommendation), or it could be progressively scanned with 50 full frames a second (called 1250/50/1). The interlaced version was the one used in practice. In any case, the number of visible lines was 1152, twice the standard 576 lines vertical definition. The full number of lines in a frame period, included those that cannot be displayed, was 1250. This made for a 32 ¬µs line period. According to ITU recommendation for HDTV standards parameters ITU-R BT.709-5 the active part of the line was 26.67 ¬µs long (see also the LDK 9000 camera document http://peerimaging.com/publications/SMPTE_LDK9000_1994.pdf LDK 9000 CCD camera). Had the modern trend for square pixels applied, this would have yielded a 2048x1152 sampling grid. There was no such requirement in the standard, though, since CRT monitors don't need any extra scaling to be able to show non-square pixels. According to the specification, the sampling rate for the interlaced input to use was 72 MHz, resulting in 72 x 26.67 = 1920 horizontal samples. It was then reconverted to 1440 from within the sampled domain. The input signal often originated from sources previously sampled at only 54 MHz, for economical reasons, and therefore already containing no more than the analogue equivalent of 1440 samples per line. Anyway, the starting point for BRE was a 1440x1152 sampling grid (twice the horizontal and vertical resolutions of digital SD), interlaced, at 25 fps.ETSI specification of the D2-HDMAC/Packet system (ETS 300 352), section 5.2.1 To improve horizontal resolution of the D2-MAC norm, only its bandwidth had to be increased. This was easily done as, unlike PAL, the sound is not sent on a sub-carrier, but multiplexed with the picture. However, to increase vertical bandwidth was more complex, as the line frequency had to stay at 15.625 kHz to be compatible with D2-MAC. This offered three choices: * 50 frames per second with only 288 lines for fast moving scenes (20 ms mode) * 25 frames per second with 576 lines for normally moving scenes (40 ms mode) * 12.5 frames per second with all 1152 lines for slow motion (80 ms mode) As none of the three modes would have been sufficient, the choice during encoding was not made for the whole picture, but for little blocks of 16√ó16 pixels. The signal then contained hints (the DATV digital stream) that controlled which de-interlacing method the decoder should use. The 20 ms mode offered an improved temporal resolution, but the 80 ms was the only one that provided High spatial definition in the usual sense. The 40 ms mode threw away one the HD fields and reconstructed it in the receiver with the assistance of motion compensation data. Some indications were also provided in case of a whole frame movement (camera panning,..) to improve the quality of the reconstruction. The encoder could work in \\"Camera\\" operating mode, using the three coding modes, but also in \\"film\\" mode where the 20 ms coding mode was not used. The 80 ms mode took advantage of its reduced 12.5 fps frame rate to spread the contents of an HD frame over two SD frames, meaning four 20 ms fields = 80 ms, hence the name. But that was not enough, as a single HD frame contains the equivalent of 4 SD frames. This could have been \\"solved\\" by doubling the bandwidth of the D2-MAC signal, thus increasing the allowed horizontal resolution by the same factor. Instead, the standard D2-MAC channel bandwidth was preserved, and one pixel out of two was dropped from each line. This sub-sampling was done in a quincux pattern. Assuming pixels on a line independently numbered from 1 to 1440, only pixels 1,3,5... were retained from the first line, pixels 2, 4, 6... from the second, 1, 3, 5...again from the third, and so on. That way, information from all the columns of the HD frame were conveyed to the receiver. Each missing pixel was surrounded by 4 transmitted ones (except on the sides) and could be interpolated from them. The resulting 720 horizontal resolution was further truncated to the 697 samples per line limit of the D2-HDMAC video multiplex.ETSI specification of the D2-HDMAC/Packet system (ETS 300 352), 5.3.6 Baseband format As a consequence of those operations, a 4:1 reduction factor was achieved, allowing the high definition video signal to be transported in a standard D2-MAC channel. The samples retained by the BRE were assembled into a valid standard definition D2-MAC vision signal and finally converted to analogue for transmission. The modulation parameters were such that the independence of the samples was preserved.ETSI specification of the D2-HDMAC/Packet system (ETS 300 352), 10.2.2 Nyquist filtering To fully decode the picture, the receiver had to sample the signal again and then read from the memory several times. The BRD (Bandwidth Restoration Decoder) in the receiver would then reconstruct a 1394x1152 sampling grid from it, under the control of the DATV stream, to be fed into its DAC. The final output was a 1250 (1152 visible) lines, 25 fps, interlaced, analogue HD video signal, with a 50 Hz field frequency. = Progressive scanning = European systems are generally referred to as 50 Hz standards (field frequency). The two fields are 20 ms apart in time. The Eu95 project stated it would evolve towards 1152p/50, and it is taken into account as a possible source in the D2-HDMAC specification. In that format, a full frame is captured every 20 ms, thus preserving the quality of motion of television and topping it with solid artifact-free frames representing only one instant in time, as is done for cinema. The 24 fps frame frequency of cinema is a bit low, though, and a generous amount of motion smear is required to allow the eye to perceive a smooth motion. 50 Hz is more than twice that rate, and the motion smear can be reduced in proportion, allowing for sharper pictures. In practice, 50P was not used very much. Some tests were even done by having film shot at 50 fps and subsequently telecined.http://www.bbceng.info/Eng_Inf/EngInf_34.pdf BBC engineering at IBC 88 Thomson / LER presented a progressive camera. However, it used a form of quincunx sampling and had therefore some bandwidth constraints.IEEE article about Thomson/LER progressive camera This requirement meant pushing the technology boundaries of the time, and would have added to the notorious lack of sensitivity of some Eu 95 cameras (particularly CRT ones). This thirst for light was one of the problems that plagued the operators shooting the French film \\"L'affaire Seznec (The Seznec case)\\" in 1250i. Some CCD cameras were developed in the context of the project, see for example LDK9000 : 50 DB signal to noise ratio at 30 MHz, at F/4. The Eu95 system would have provided better compatibility with cinema technology than its competitor, first because of progressive scanning, and second because of the convenience and quality of transfer between 50 Hz standards and film (no motion artifacts, one just needs to invert the usual \\"PAL speed-up\\" process by slowing down the frame rate in a 25/24 ratio). Taking one frame out of two from a 50P stream would have provided a suitable 25P video as a starting point for this operation. If the sequence is shot at 50 P with a fully opened shutter, it will produce the same amount of motion smear as a 25P shot with a half opened shutter, a common setting when shooting with a standard movie camera. In practice, Hi-Vision seems to have been more successful in that regard, having been used for films such as Giulia e Giulia(1987) and Prospero's books(1991). = Recording = thumb  Consumer  A consumer tape recorder prototype was presented in 1988. It had an 80-minute recording time and used a 1.25 cm \\"metal\\" tape. Bandwidth was 10.125 MHz and signal to noise ratio 42 dB.http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP- BT.2003-1994-PDF-F.pdf Harmonisation des normes de TVHD...,Section 3.3.5.1 An HD-MAC videodisc prototype had been designed as well.IEEE article about HD-MAC videodisc The version that was presented in 1988 could record 20 mn per side of a 30 cm disc. Bandwidth was 12 MHz and S/N 32 dB.http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-BT.2003-1994-PDF-F.pdf Harmonisation des normes de TVHD...,Section 3.3.5.2 This media was used for several hours at Expo 92.https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_254-tejerina.pdf Expo 92, section 6.1.1  Professional equipment  On the studio and production side, it was entirely different. HD-MAC bandwidth reduction techniques bring the HD pixel rate down to the level of SD. So in theory, it would have been possible to use an SD digital video recorder, assuming it provides enough room for the DATV assistance stream, which requires less than 1.1 Mbit/s. SD video using 4:2:0 format (12 bits per pixel) needs 720x576x25x12 bits per second, which is slightly less than 125 Mbit/s, to be compared with the 270 Mbit/s available from a D-1 machine. But there is no real reason for the studio equipment to be constrained by HD-MAC, as the latter is only a transmission standard, used to convey the HD material from the transmitter to the viewers. Furthermore, technical and financial resources are available to store the HD video with better quality, for editing and archiving. So in practice, other methods were used. At the start of the Eureka95 project the only means of recording the HD signal from a camera was on a massive 1-inch reel-to-reel tape machine, the BTS BCH 1000, which was based on the Type B videotape format but with 8 video heads instead of the two normally used, thus accommodating the higher bandwidth requirements of HD-MAC. The plan within the Eureka95 project was to develop an uncompressed 72 MHz sampling digital recorder, dubbed the \\"Gigabit\\" recorder. It was expected to take a year to develop, so in the interim, two alternative digital recording systems were assembled, both using the standard definition \\"D1\\" uncompressed digital component recorder as starting points. The Quincunx-subsampled, or double/dual D1 system developed by Thomson used two D-1 digital recorders which were synchronized in a master/slave relationship. Odd fields could then be recorded on one of the D-1 and even fields on the other. Horizontally the system recorded just half the horizontal bandwidth, with samples taken in a quincunx sampling grid. This gave the system a full bandwidth performance in the diagonal direction, but halved horizontally or vertically depending on the exact image temporal-spatial characteristics. The Quadriga http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1989-13.pdf BBC R&D; document about the Quadriga system was developed by the BBC in 1988 using 4 synchronised D1 recorders, 54 MHz sampling, and distributed the signal in such a way that blocks of 4 pixels were sent to each recorder in turn. Thus if a single tape was viewed, the image would appear as a fair but distorted representation of the whole image, enabling edit decisions to be taken on a single recording, and a three-machine edit was possible on a single quadriga by processing each of the four channels in turn, with identical edits made on the other three channels subsequently under the control of a programmed edit controller. The original D1 recorders were restricted to a parallel video interface with very bulky short cables, but this was not a problem, since the digital signals were contained with the 5 half-height racks (4 D1s and the interface/control/interleaving rack) which made up the Quadriga, and initially all external signals were analogue components. The introduction of SDI (the 270Mbit/s Serial Digital Interface) simplified cabling by the time the BBC constructed a second Quadriga. Philips also constructed a Quadriga but used a slightly different format, with the HD image divided into four quadrants, each quadrant going to one of the four recorders. Excepting a slightly longer processing delay, it otherwise worked similarly to the BBC approach, and both versions of the Quadriga equipment were made to be interoperable, switchable between interleaved and quadrant modes. In about 1993 Philips, in a joint venture with Bosch (BTS), produced a \\"BRR\\" (or Bit Rate Reduction) recording system to enable the full HD signal to be recorded onto a single D1 (or D5) recorder. A low-resolution version of the image could be viewed in the centre of the screen if the tape was replayed on a conventional D1 recorder, and was surrounded by what appeared to be noise, but was in fact simply coded/compressed data, in a similar way to later MPEG digital compression techniques, with a compression rate of 5:1, starting with 72 MHz sampling. Some BRR equipment also contained Quadriga interfaces, for ease of conversion between recording formats, also being switchable between BBC and Philips versions of the Quadriga format. By this time, Quadriga signals were being carried on four SDI cables. Finally, with help from Toshiba, in around 2000, the Gigabit recorder, by now known as the D6 \\"Voodoo\\", was produced, some years after work on the 1250-line system had ceased in favour of the Common Image Format, the HDTV system as it is known today. Hence the quality of Eureka 95 archives is higher than what viewers could see at the output of an HD-MAC decoder.  Transfer to film  For the making of the HD-based movie L'affaire Seznec, the Thomson company certified it would be able to transfer HD to 35 mm film. But none of the attempts were successful (shooting was done on dual-D1). However, another French movie shot in 1994, Du fond du coeur: Germaine et Benjamin, allegedly achieved such a transfer. It is said to have been shot in digital high definition,http://www.answers.com/topic/du- fond-du-coeur-germaine-et-benjamin Film description available from many sites in 1250 lines.http://www.lesechos.fr/01/03/1994/LesEchos/16593-96-ECH_vision-1250-parie- sur-la-video-haute-definition-dans-le-cinema.htm Germaine et Benjamin produced in vision 1250 format If so, it would arguably be the first digital high definition movie, using a film-friendly 50 Hz field rate, 7 years before Vidocq and 8 years before Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones.. For a historical perspective on HD-originated movies, one can mention early attempts such as 'Harlow', shot in 1965 using a near-HD analogue 819 lines process that later evolved to higher resolutions (see Electronovision).  Project's afterlife  Experience was gained on important building blocks like HD digital recording, digital processing including motion compensation, HD CCD cameras, and also in factors driving acceptance or rejection of a new format by the professionals, and all of that was put to good use in the subsequent Digital Video Broadcasting project which, in contrast to HD-MAC, is a great worldwide success. Despite early claims by competitors that it could not do HD, it was soon deployed in Australia for just that purpose. The cameras and tape recorders were reused for early experiments in digital high definition cinema. The US brought home some of the Eu95 cameras to be studied in the context of their own HDTV standard development effort. In France, a company called VTHR (Video Transmission Haute Resolution) used the Eu95 hardware for some time to retransmit cultural events to small villages (later, they switched to upscaled 15 Mbit/s MPEG2 SD). In 1993, Texas Instruments built a 2048x1152 DMD prototype.https://web.archive.org/web/20020106031024/http://www.dlp.com/dlp/resources/tech_over.asp Ti's 2048x1152 DMD, High Resolution No rationale is exposed in the papers for choosing this specific resolution over the Japanese 1035 active lines system, or alternatively doubling the 480 lines of the standard US TV to 960, but that way it could cover all resolutions expected to be present on the market, and that included the European one, which happened to be the highest. Some legacy of this development may be seen in \\"2K\\" and \\"4K\\" digital movie projectors using TI DLP chips, which run a slightly wider than usual 2048x1080 or 4096x2160 resolution, giving 1.896:1 aspect ratio without anamorphic stretching (vs the 1.778:1 of regular 16:9, with 1920 or 3840 horizontal pixels), give a little (6.7%) more horizontal resolution with anamorphic lenses when showing 2.21:1 (or wider) movies specifically prepared for them, and further enhancement (~13.78%) through reduced letterboxing if used without such lenses. As of 2010, some computer monitors with 2048x1152 resolution were available (e.g. Samsung 2343BWX 23, Dell SP2309W). This unlikely to be in reference to Eu95, especially as the refresh rate will generally default to \\"60 Hz\\" (or 59.94 Hz), but simply a convenient \\"HD+\\" resolution made for bragging rights over ubiquitous 1920x1080 HD panels, with the slimmest possible actual resolution improvement whilst keeping the same 16:9 resolution for video playback without cropping or letterboxing (the next nearest \\"convenient\\" 16:9 resolution being the comparatively much larger, so much more expensive 2560x1600 \\"2.5K\\" as used in e.g. Apple Cinema and Retina displays); it is also a \\"neat\\" power-of-2 width, twice the width of one-time standard XGA (so, e.g. websites designed for that width can be smoothly zoomed to 200%), and happens to be 4x the size of the 1024x576 panels commonly used for cheaper netbooks and mobile tablets (much as the 2.5K standard is 4x the 1280x800 WXGA used in ultraportable laptops and midrange tablets). In this way, it can be considered a form of convergent specification evolution - although there's little chance the two standards are directly related, their particulars will have been landed on by broadly similar methods. Although the fact is now mainly of historical interest, most larger-tube CRT PC monitors had a maximum horizontal scan rate of 70 kHz or higher, which means they could have handled 2048x1152 at 60 Hz progressive if set to use a custom resolution (with slimmer vertical blanking margins than HD-MAC/Eu95 itself for those rated for less than 75 kHz). Monitors able to support the lower refresh rate, including smaller models incapable of 70 kHz but good for at least 58 kHz (preferably 62.5 kHz) and able to support the lower vertical refresh rate could instead be set to run 50 Hz progressive, or even 100 Hz interlace to avert the flicker that would otherwise cause.

It is west of the midlands of Ireland, about north of Galway city. Humans have lived in the area since the Bronze Age while the historic period dates from the 6th century. The town became increasingly important in the 11th and 12th centuries in political and religious aspects of Ireland. The market- based layout of the town and square indicates the importance of commerce. History The record of human settlement in Tuam dates back to the Bronze Age when an area adjacent to Shop Street was used as a burial ground. The name Tuam is a cognate with the Latin term tumulus (burial mound). The town's ancient name was Tuaim D√° Ghualann, i.e. the burial mound of two shoulders. The name probably refers to the high ground on either side of the River Nanny, overlooking a probable fording point over the River Nanny (or Corchra). In 1875, a Bronze Age burial urn was discovered in the area by workmen, dating from c.1500 B.C.A Brief History of Tuam. A Town of Two Cathedrals. 2006 The history of Tuam as a settlement dates from the early sixth century. Legend states that a monk called Jarlath who was a member of a religious community at Cloonfush some west of Tuam and adjacent to the religious settlement at Kilbannon. According to the Life of Brendan of Clonfert, Brendan eventually told Jarlath \\"Not here at all shall be thy resurrection\\". When Jarlath asked where this may be, Brendan responded: \\"Have a new chariot made for thou art old; and go thy way in it, and wherever the two hind shafts of the chariot will break, there will be thy resurrection, and that of many others with thee\\". Jarlath's wheel broke at Tuam and he established a monastery there, known as the School of Tuam. As was typical with early settlements in Ireland, religious sites became established first and towns grew around them. Likewise, Tuam grew up around the monastery and has kept the broken chariot wheel as its heraldic symbol. In 1049, Aedh O'Connor defeated Amalgaid ua Flaithbertaigh, King of Iar Connacht, making the O'Connors provincial kings of Connacht. He then built a castle at Tuam and made it his principal stronghold. This event was directly responsible for the subsequent rise in the importance of the town. Its position dominated the Iar Connacht heartland of Maigh Se√≥la. In the twelfth century, the town became the centre of Provincial power during the fifty-year reign of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (r. 1106‚Äì1156). He also brought Tuam its most prominent status as seat of the High King of Ireland which he achieved by force of arms during his long career. About 1140 Tairrdelach founded an Augustinian priory in Tuam with possession over three church sites in Ciarraige Airne, east County Mayo.See Anne Connon, 'Plotting Acallam na Senorach: the physical context of the 'Mayo' sequence, p85 in Sarah Sheehan [et al.](ed.) Gablanach in Scelaigecht: Celtic studies in honour of Ann Dooley (Dublin, 2013) At the Synod of Kells in 1152, the centre of government also became the ecclesiastical centre, as Tuam was elevated to an Archbishopric, with √Åed Ua hOiss√≠n as the first Archbishop. Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as High King of Ireland from 1128‚Äì1156, was a great patron of the Irish Church and it was due to his patronage that Tuam became the home of some masterpieces of 12th century Celtic art, including the Cross of Cong. Tairrdelbach was succeeded by his son Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, the last native High King of Ireland. In 1164, Ruaidr√≠ had a \\"wonderful castle\\" erected, with a large courtyard defended by lofty and massive walls and a deep moat into which the adjacent river was diverted through. This was the first Irish built stone castle. A small part of the castle still stands. Following the destruction of the first Cathedral in 1184, Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair left Tuam and retired to Cong Abbey, where he entrusted the Church valuables from the Cathedral at Tuam into the care of the abbot. This left Tuam as a small settlement and it wasn't until the early 17th century that it began to grow in importance again. Throughout history, Tuam has been an important commercial centre with fairs and markets being an important part of commerce in the region. One of its fairs dates to 1252 when Letters Patent were granted to Archbishop MacFlynn by Henry III of England. Other fairs were authorised by Charters granted by James VI and I and George III of the United Kingdom.Tuam Official Guide c.1958 The Annals of the Four Masters record that in 1488 \\"A whirlwind attacked a number of persons, as they were cutting turf on the bog of Tuaim-Mona, which killed one of them, and swelled the faces of the rest; and four others were killed by the same wind in Machaire-Chonnacht.\\" In July 1920, the town hall and other properties were burned down by armed Royal Irish Constabulary men, after two had been killed in an ambush by the Irish Republican Army near the town the day before. =Borough of Tuam= Chair of Tuam Monument On 30 March 1613, Tuam received a royal charter from James VI and I, which enabled the Tuam Parliamentary constituency to send two representatives to Irish House of Commons until its abolition in 1800. The town was laid out as a market town to its present plan with all the streets converging on the central square. The charter also established a formal local council with an elected sovereign and 12 burgesses. The sovereign was sworn into office at the site of the \\"Chair of Tuam\\" which is believed to be within the remaining tower of Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair's castle. A monumental \\"Chair of Tuam\\" was unveiled in May 1980 by the late Cardinal Tom√°s O'Fiaich. =High crosses of Tuam= High Cross of Tuam Headpiece of the High Cross of Tuam The High Cross of Tuam was erected in 1152 possibly to commemorate the appointment of the first Archbishop of Tuam, Archbishop √Åed Ua hOiss√≠n. An inscription at the base calls for \\"A prayer for O'hOis√≠n; for the Abbot; by whom it was made\\". It is reputed to have been the tallest of the High Crosses of Ireland, but its artistry is scarred by the absence of the top portion of the main shaft. The sandstone Cross was originally erected in proximity to the earliest Cathedral erected in the town, a part of which still remains and is incorporated into St Mary's Cathedral (12th-century red sandstone chancel arch in Irish Romanesque architecture, which is a National monument). The original High Cross or Market cross may have been erected close to what is now the Market Square and High Street. When the first Cathedral collapsed after being destroyed by fire in 1184, the High Cross was dismantled into pieces, each under different ownership. The archaeologist George Petrie discovered the base of the High Cross c. 1820 and later discovered two other pieces in other locations. The High Cross contains a portion from another High Cross, the ringed cross-section on top. In addition to the Market Cross, it is likely that there were at least four other carved stone crosses from the Connor's reign in the town. An area close to the town Square, known as the Shambles, which continued to function as a market place until recently, was at one point the location of the Market Cross until 1721. The Cross was brought to Dublin for the Great Exhibition of 1852. However, prior to its return to Tuam, a disagreement arose between the two Churches. Catholic Archbishop Dr. John MacHale claimed the Cross rightfully belonged to Catholics, with Dean Charles Seymour of the Church of Ireland asserting a Protestant claim. Agreement was reached with the Cross erected half way between both Cathedrals and positioned so that it was visible from all main streets of the town. It was in the Square in the town centre in 1874. By the late 1980s, it was evident that the decorative stone carving of the Cross was deteriorating due to weathering and pollution. Experts thought that there was a danger from traffic passing nearby. After lengthy discussions, the Office of Public Works removed the monument from the Square in April 1992. Following cleaning and minor restoration, the High Cross was re-erected in the south transept of St Mary's Cathedral, where it now is, near its original location. St Mary's Cathedral also houses the shaft of a third Cross fashioned from limestone. It is thought that all of the High Crosses would have marked the boundaries of the monastic section of Tuam. =Coat of arms= The red latin cross is representative of Tuam's importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The double green flaunches at the sides, represent the two hills or shoulders of Tuam's ancient name, Tuaim Dh√° Ghualainn. The two crowns recall the High Kings, Tairrdelbach and Ruaidr√≠, who were based in Tuam. The broken chariot wheel being a reminder of the foundation of the monastic town when Jarlath's chariot wheel broke. The motto of the town, Tuath Thuama go Buan, translates as \\"Long Live the People of Tuam\\".Glimpses of Tuam Since the Famine, J.A. Claffey, , 1997, Publisher: Old Tuam Society =Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home= The Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home, St Mary's Mother and Baby Home, or simply The Home, was a maternity home for unmarried mothers and their children that operated between 1925 and 1961 in the town. It was run by the Bon Secours religious order of nuns. From its construction in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century, the building served as a workhouse for the poor. Excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 that had been ordered by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation, under Judge Yvonne Murphy, found a \\"significant\\" quantity of human remains, aged from 35 foetal weeks to two to three years, interred in a vault with twenty chambers. The report said: \\"The Commission has not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appears to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water. The Commission has also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.\\" Carbon dating confirmed that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the Mother and Baby Home by the Bon Secours order. The Commission stated that it was shocked by the discovery and that it is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way. Climate Transport N83. Tuam is served by the N17 road (Galway to Sligo) and the N83 road (to Ballyhaunis) as well as R332 and R347. A bypass of the N17, avoiding congestion to the west of the town, involved acquisition of land by Galway County Council in late 2006. The design of this road includes a bridge over the existing closed railway lines, allowing for future re-opening of the line. The M17 was opened ahead of schedule on 27 September 2017. Tuam railway station is located on the disused railway line from Athenry to Sligo. There was a part-successful campaign by West-on-track to have the line reopened as a Western Railway Corridor which was recognised in the Transport21 project. Construction work to reopen the line between Ennis and Athenry was completed in 2009. Passengers trains run between Limerick and (where connections to Galway can be made) with further extensions planned. Tuam railway station opened on 27 September 1860, closed to passenger traffic on 5 April 1976 and finally closed altogether on 18 December 1978. The railway lines were heavily used by trains transporting sugar beets to the Irish Sugar Factory (Comhlucht Si√∫cra √âireann Teo.) formerly located off the Ballygaddy Road. The railway line was used during the filming of The Quiet Man, and can be seen when John Wayne disembarks at Ballyglunin, around 6 km (4 mi) from Tuam. The Western Rail Corridor expected to reopen through town on October 8th 2020. Tuam is served by multiple Bus √âireann routes.25, 52, 64, 417, 429, and 433.

Geography The town is on a plateau in the heart of Bukidnon, situated between the Kalatungan and Kitanglad Mountain Ranges, after which its native name of \\"lantapan\\" was derived which means \\"level-on-top\\". Lantapan is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Sumilao and Impasugong; east by Malaybalay City; south by Valencia City; and west by Talakag.

The Tala‚Äôandig (one of the 7 tribes of Bukidnon) Ancestral Territory is native to Barangay Songco, where the tribal ways and customary law is tried to be revived and preserved. A school for living tradition was built as an avenue for elders to teach the young the traditional Tala‚Äôandig way of life, including its history, rituals, music, arts, embroidery, dance, and literature. Other activities involved earth paintings (painting utilizing soil as a medium), singing and dancing to traditional music, and making musical instruments and indigenous accessories among others. Economy Cassava chips and corn being dried in the community solar dryer. Lantapan's economy is basically agri-based. Agriculture Lantapan has agri-based economy. Farming has remained a dominant economic activity among the Lantapanons. The major crops grown are corn, coffee, cabbage and potatoes, sugarcane and other high valued crops and bananas also becoming an important commercial crop. Lantapan is also home to two banana plantations: the Mount Kitanglad Agri-Ventures Inc. (MKAVI) and the Dole Banana Plantation with thousands of hectares of lands in the highland-barangays of the town planted with export quality bananas. The plantations started their operation in 1998 with thousand of residents of the municipality employed. Commerce There are 428 commercial establishments registered at the Licensing Division of the municipality, 15 of which are classified under agro-industrial, manufacturing and servicing. Trading activities include wholesale buying of corn, coffee and vegetables by traders from within Lantapan, neighboring towns in Bukidnon and Cagayan de Oro City. Finance For finance, the informal credit or \\"suki\\" system prevails. In this arrangement, the trader is usually the \\"suki\\" who provides credit too and buys the products of the farmer. A few cooperatives in some barangays also extend small loans to their members. An Asian Hills Bank located at the Poblacion and established in 1978, is owned by a private corporation. Its portfolio includes agricultural, commercial and real estate loans. Attractions Kitanglad Mountain Range as viewed from Songco ;Kitanglad Mountain Range: The Kitanglad Mountain Range is a very significant landmark in the cultural history of the indigenous peoples of Bukidnon with Mount Dulang-dulang considered as a sacred place. Being an ancestral domain, permission to enter must be secured from the tribal leaders of the Tala‚Äôandig tribe of Lantapan in deference to the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) mandated under the IPRA Law. :The long trek to Mount Dulang-dulang‚Äôs summit goes through virgin dense forests, home to old trees covered with moss and lichens. At the highest peak, there is a panoramic view of the entire Kitanglad range, and on clear days, the distant Mount Apo. Sitio Bol-ogan in Barangay Songco of Lantapan is the shortest route towards the major start point to the peaks of Mount Kitanglad (with an elevation of above sea level) and Mount Dulang-dulang (with an elevation of above sea level) which is the country‚Äôs second-highest mountain, next to Mount Apo.at above sea level ;Cinchona Forest Reserve: The Cinchona Forest Reserve was established through a presidential proclamation in 1936, and now forms part of the protected area of the Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park. It is home to the Cinchona Plantation, established at Barangay Kaatuan in 1929, and said to be the only of its kind left in Asia and the Pacific where the medicinal plant Cinchona (Cinchona ledgeriana) is grown. Cinchona, is a medium-sized tropical tree that can grow up with a diameter, is a source of quinine that is used for malaria treatment. The farm covers an area of where 7 Cinchona tree species are found and is planted mostly with Albizza falcataria (= Falcataria moluccana) and other medicinal trees. Located above sea level, the area is considered as the coldest place in Bukidnon with temperatures ranging from . ;Binahon Agro-forestry Farm: The Binahon Agro-forestry Farm, located at Sitio Bol-ogan, Barangay Songco, on the slopes of Mt. Kitanglad, is a learning institution for farmers, agriculturists, and rural development workers. Situated some above sea level, it cultivates various forest species such as Caribbean pine trees, lawaan, falcata, abaca, and eucalyptus. Fruit trees are also planted in the area with vegetables sown in between. Farm animals such as carabaos, horse, goats, sheep, hogs and other livestock animals are grown in the farm together with honeybees and tilapia. The farm also offers facilities for lodging to visiting tourists, researchers, scientists and mountaineers. Barangay Kaatuan is also home to 8 conjoint water falls: 7 water falls pouring its contents onto another water falls. This conjoint waterfall is supplied by the Kulasihan River, and situated five kilometers from the barangay proper of Kaatuan called Block 2. Infrastructure The municipality of Lantapan has a fairly well-paved road system especially the National Road the runs lengthwise through the municipality. =Health services= The rural health unit (RHU) maintains one central health unit and 14 barangay health stations. The RHU provides medical, dental, family planning and laboratory services. Recently, it has started to provide special care and rehabilitation to malnourished children. One privately owned clinic for urgent care on minor cases and two registered mini-pharmaceutical stores are found in the Poblacion. =Water= Potable water is distributed through individual installations of 3,958 households. A feasibility study is being developed for the establishments of an improved and modern water system for Lantapan which entails tapping the Kulasihan and Songco water sources for an estimated flow of 45,018.168 cubic meter per hour. =Security= Lantapan is generally peaceful. Security in the area is ably maintained by the local police force. Trained civilian forces, the \\"Bantay-Bayan\\" and the Civilian Volunteer Organization (CVO) in the barangays also provide support to crime prevention. Education Presently, there is a total of 24 primary, elementary and secondary schools in Lantapan. These schools serve approximately 7,000 children. Day care centers under the Department of Social Welfare and Development provide preparatory education to pre-schoolers in the barangays.

Biography Lindsay was born into a middle-class Scottish Calvinist family in London, and was brought up partly in Jedburgh, where he had family background. He was educated at Colfe's School, Lewisham,Old Colfeians, Colfe's School website and won a scholarship to university, but for financial reasons went into business, becoming an insurance clerk at Lloyd's of London.\\"David Lindsay\\" by Gary K. Wolfe, in E. F. Bleiler, ed. Supernatural Fiction Writers:Fantasy and Horror. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.541‚Äì548. He was successful, but his career was interrupted by service in the First World War I, starting at the age of 40. He first joined the Grenadier Guards, then the Royal Army Pay Corps, in which he was promoted to Corporal. After the war Lindsay and his young wife moved to Porth near Newquay in Cornwall, and lived there from 1919 to 1929.He became a full-time writer there. His novel A Voyage to Arcturus was published in 1920, but it was not a success, selling fewer than six hundred copies. The work shows links with Scottish fantasists such as George MacDonald, whose work Lindsay was familiar with, and it had a central influence on C. S. Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet.Kathryn Lindskoog ‚Äì A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower J. R. R. Tolkien said that he had read the book \\"with avidity\\", and characterised it as a work of philosophy, religion and morality. Lindsay attempted to write a more commercial novel with his next work The Haunted Woman (1922), but this was barely more successful than Voyage. He continued to write novels, including the humorous potboiler The Adventures of Monsieur de Mailly, set in France in the time of Louis XIV. Bernard Sellin Life and Works of David Lindsay. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009. (p. 28-30). After publishing Devil's Tor in 1932 he found it increasingly difficult to get his work issued and spent much of his time on his last work, The Witch, which was not published in his lifetime. With his wife, Lindsay opened a boarding house in Brighton, but they did not prosper and their marriage came under considerable strain. The house was damaged by the first bomb to fall on Brighton in the Second World War, and Lindsay, who was in his bath at the time, never recovered from the shock. His death from an infection resulting from an abscess in his tooth was unrelated to the bomb; Darrell Schweitzer attributed it to Lindsay allowing \\"rotting teeth to develop into cancer of the jaw\\".\\"Books, by Darrell Schweitzer: SERIOUS FICTION\\", in Aboriginal Science Fiction; March‚ÄìApril 1989 Work A Voyage to Arcturus has been described as the major \\"underground\\" novel of the 20th century. The secret of Lindsay's apparent originality as a novelist lies in his metaphysical assumptions.Darrell Schweitzer, \\"A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay\\" in Gary Westfahl, ed. The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2005. (p. 1329-1331). Like the gnostics he seems to have viewed the \\"real\\" world as an illusion, which must be rejected in order to perceive genuine \\"truth\\". In The Haunted Woman, the two main characters discover a room which seems to exist only some of the time; while they are there together, they can see more clearly and express themselves honestly. In The Violet Apple, the fruit of the title is of the species eaten by Adam and Eve, and Lindsay's description of its effects is a startling, lyrical episode in a novel which is otherwise concerned with rather ordinary matters. Lindsay's austere vision of \\"true reality\\" seems to have been influenced by Norse mythology. After being out of print for many decades, Lindsay's work has become increasingly available. In 1971, A Voyage to Arcturus was produced as a 35mm feature film by William J. Holloway. It was the first film to be funded by a National Endowment for the Arts grant and has recently been re-released. Harold Bloom was also interested in Lindsay's life and career, going so far as to publish a novel, The Flight to Lucifer, which he thought of as a Bloomian misprision, an homage and deep revision of A Voyage to Arcturus. Bloom, however, conceded that his late-comer imitation is overwhelmed by Lindsay's great original. Colin Wilson was also interested in David Lindsay. He wrote an essay, \\"The Haunted Man: Lindsay as Novelist and Mystic\\" that first appeared in the book The Strange Genius of David Lindsay (1970), as well as prefaces to The Violet Apple, The Witch and Sphinx.Colin Wilson on David Lindsay Bibliography *A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) *The Haunted Woman (1922) *Sphinx (1923) * The Violet Apple (1924, first published 1976) *Adventures of Monsieur de Mailly (1926) [UK]; A Blade for Sale (1927) [US]The Adventures of Monsieur de Mailly/A Blade for Sale *Devil's Tor (1932) *A Christmas Play (1930s, first published 2003) *The Witch (unfinished, first published 1976) References Sources *The Strange Genius of David Lindsay: An Appreciation (1970) by J.

The frequencies in the white noise corresponding to the original signal's frequencies will resonate with each other, amplifying the original signal while not amplifying the rest of the white noise (thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio which makes the original signal more prominent). Further, the added white noise can be enough to be detectable by the sensor, which can then filter it out to effectively detect the original, previously undetectable signal. This phenomenon of boosting undetectable signals by resonating with added white noise extends to many other systems, whether electromagnetic, physical or biological, and is an area of research. Technical description Stochastic resonance (SR) is observed when noise added to a system changes the system's behaviour in some fashion. More technically, SR occurs if the signal-to-noise ratio of a nonlinear system or device increases for moderate values of noise intensity. It often occurs in bistable systems or in systems with a sensory threshold and when the input signal to the system is \\"sub-threshold\\". For lower noise intensities, the signal does not cause the device to cross threshold, so little signal is passed through it. For large noise intensities, the output is dominated by the noise, also leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio. For moderate intensities, the noise allows the signal to reach threshold, but the noise intensity is not so large as to swamp it. Thus, a plot of signal-to-noise ratio as a function of noise intensity contains a peak. Strictly speaking, stochastic resonance occurs in bistable systems, when a small periodic (sinusoidal) force is applied together with a large wide band stochastic force (noise). The system response is driven by the combination of the two forces that compete/cooperate to make the system switch between the two stable states. The degree of order is related to the amount of periodic function that it shows in the system response. When the periodic force is chosen small enough in order to not make the system response switch, the presence of a non-negligible noise is required for it to happen. When the noise is small very few switches occur, mainly at random with no significant periodicity in the system response. When the noise is very strong a large number of switches occur for each period of the sinusoid and the system response does not show remarkable periodicity. Between these two conditions, there exists an optimal value of the noise that cooperatively concurs with the periodic forcing in order to make almost exactly one switch per period (a maximum in the signal-to-noise ratio). Such a favorable condition is quantitatively determined by the matching of two time scales: the period of the sinusoid (the deterministic time scale) and the Kramers rateKramers, H.A.: Brownian motion in a field of force and the diffusion model of chemical reactions. Physica (Utrecht) 7, 284‚Äì304 (1940)} (i.e., the average switch rate induced by the sole noise: the inverse of the stochastic time scaleHannes Risken The Fokker-Planck Equation, 2nd edition, Springer, 1989). Thus the term \\"stochastic resonance\\". Stochastic resonance was discovered and proposed for the first time in 1981 to explain the periodic recurrence of ice ages. Since then the same principle has been applied in a wide variety of systems. Nowadays stochastic resonance is commonly invoked when noise and nonlinearity concur to determine an increase of order in the system response. Suprathreshold stochastic resonance Suprathreshold stochastic resonance is a particular form of stochastic resonance. It is the phenomenon where random fluctuations, or noise, provide a signal processing benefit in a nonlinear system. Unlike most of the nonlinear systems where stochastic resonance occurs, suprathreshold stochastic resonance occurs not only when the strength of the fluctuations is small relative to that of an input signal, but occurs even for the smallest amount of random noise. Furthermore, it is not restricted to a subthreshold signal, hence the qualifier. Neuroscience/psychology and biology Stochastic resonance has been observed in the neural tissue of the sensory systems of several organisms. Computationally, neurons exhibit SR because of non-linearities in their processing. SR has yet to be fully explained in biological systems, but neural synchrony in the brain (specifically in the gamma wave frequency) has been suggested as a possible neural mechanism for SR by researchers who have investigated the perception of \\"subconscious\\" visual sensation. Single neurons in vitro including cerebellar Purkinje cells and squid giant axon could also demonstrate the inverse stochastic resonance, when spiking is inhibited by synaptic noise of a particular variance. Medicine SR-based techniques have been used to create a novel class of medical devices for enhancing sensory and motor functions such as vibrating insoles especially for the elderly, or patients with diabetic neuropathy or stroke.E. Sejdiƒá, L. A. Lipsitz, \\"Necessity of noise in physiology and medicine,\\" Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, vol. 111, no. 2, pp. 459-470, Aug. 2013. See the Review of Modern Physics article for a comprehensive overview of stochastic resonance. Stochastic Resonance has found noteworthy application in the field of image processing. Signal analysis A related phenomenon is dithering applied to analog signals before analog-to-digital conversion. Stochastic resonance can be used to measure transmittance amplitudes below an instrument's detection limit. If Gaussian noise is added to a subthreshold (i.e., immeasurable) signal, then it can be brought into a detectable region. After detection, the noise is removed. A fourfold improvement in the detection limit can be obtained.

Early days Any Trouble's founding members Clive Gregson (guitar), Tom Jackson (vocals) and Chris Parks (guitar) met at Crewe and Alsager Teacher Training College in 1974. Soon after, Mel Harley (drums) and Phil Barnes (bass) completed the line up. Initially Any Trouble were a covers band, playing anything they liked, including songs by Bob Dylan, The Band and a selection of American rock and roll numbers. With the advent of punk rock and then new wave, Clive Gregson realised they needed a change of material and started taking songwriting seriously. He explained in a 1999 interview, \\"We were like a human jukebox and it was obvious to me then if we wanted to get anywhere we needed original songs. I started to take it a bit more seriously then\\". After vocalist Tom Jackson left, the band was fronted by rhythm guitarist and songwriter Clive Gregson. The remaining four were the first Any Trouble line-up to record, initially releasing the Gregson composition \\"Yesterday's Love\\" as an indie single in 1979. This was picked up by some radio stations and was played by BBC Radio 1 DJs John Peel, Andy Peebles and others in the UK. Signed to Stiff Records Airplay for Any Trouble's debut indie single \\"Yesterday's Love\\" led to interest from major record labels including WEA, Chrysalis, EMI and Stiff. Any Trouble selected Stiff \\"because they were our kind of people\\". Their first release on the Stiff label, Where Are All the Nice Girls? was perhaps their most successful. The album was produced by John Wood (Fairport Convention etc.) and the band gained significant visibility after featuring on a Melody Maker front cover and in a gushing article by Allan Jones. In some ways the band's career never recovered from this early rush of success and Gregson's singing was unfairly compared to that of Elvis Costello and Ian Dury. The band's second album Wheels in Motion, with Martin Hughes replacing Mel Harley on drums, was produced by Mike Howlett; it would be the last recorded on the Stiff label in Any Trouble's original incarnation. Despite frequent touring and the release of Wheels in Motion, Any Trouble's record sales failed to grow. The band were dropped by Stiff during a 1983 US tour supporting Ian Hunter, with their manager arranging for them to open for Molly Hatchet to help keep them afloat. At that point Clive Gregson \\"pulled my plug... threw in the towel... we straggled back to NYC, where our van was robbed whilst we were in the Stiff offices trying to wrestle return tickets to the UK out of the office manager\\". The band flew back to the UK on standby tickets.Interview with Clive Gregson from Any Trouble: The Complete Stiff Recordings 1980-1981 booklet Move to EMI America and break-up After returning from their US tour without a recording contract Any Trouble took a long break, after which Clive Gregson returned to making demos. He had a meeting with subsequent manager Ray Williams who persuaded him Any Trouble had a sufficient following to justify its revival. Gregson re- formed the band and, on the strength of the demos, Williams secured a contract with Gery Gersh at EMI America. Any Trouble's new line-up included Andy Ebsworth on drums and Steve Gurl on keyboards, with original members Clive Gregson and Phil Barnes. The sessions started promisingly enough with Val Garay (The Motels) as producer but Garay left after contract negotiations broke down. David Kershenbaum (best known for producing Joe Jackson and, later, Tracy Chapman) was brought on board to produce the band's eponymous third album Any Trouble but they were unhappy with the synthesizer-heavy sound of the final mix. While they toured the UK to support the album there were no funds available from the record company for a US tour; the album failed to chart on either side of the Atlantic. Gregson decided to throw everything into Any Trouble's second effort for EMI America, producing an ambitious double album (an 11-track single LP in the US) that featured a mixture of new and previously recorded material to highlight the band's diverse range of material. The new release, titled Wrong End of the Race, also failed to chart despite support from the record company. After the failure of their second EMI album, Clive Gregson broke the band up again. He recorded a solo album and joined Richard Thompson's band for a time before starting a successful folk- rock duo with Christine Collister in the mid-1980s, on the dissolution of which he resumed his solo career from 1992 to the present. Gregson has also toured and recorded in various combinations of musicians, including Boo Hewerdine, Eddi Reader, Nanci Griffith, Andy Roberts, Ian Matthews and Dennis Locorriere. Andy Ebsworth was one of the members of Ryder, the purpose-made pop group which represented the United Kingdom at the 1986 Eurovision Song Contest. Re-formation In 2007, following the re-release of several Any Trouble albums on CD, the group reformed with the Wheels In Motion line-up of Clive Gregson, guitarist Chris Parks, bassist Phil Barnes and drummer Martin Hughes. After playing a few live gigs, Barnes had to bow out of the reformed group due to other commitments. With Mark Griffiths as a session musician on bass, the revived group recorded a new album which was released on the reborn Stiff Records label on 10 September 2007. The album was titled Life in Reverse and featured thirteen new Gregson-penned songs. It was produced by John Wood, and had unique artwork by the Stiff Records designer Tobbe Stuhre. The band played a headlining reunion gig at the Jazz Cafe in London, England to support the release. After another period of inactivity, in November 2013 Cherry Red Records released a 3-CD set The Complete Stiff Recordings 1980-81, comprising the band's first two studio albums with assorted singles and b-sides, plus the Live At The Venue album, packaged in mini-sleeves. The band supported this by re-forming to perform a one-off gig at London's 229 Club. By now, Griffiths was a full official member, and the line-up consisted of Gregson, Parks, Griffith and Hughes. Any Trouble stayed together in 2014 to record a new album Present Tense and played a short tour in England in December 2014, which included Band on the Wall, Manchester, on 2 December 2014, dates in Newcastle, Birmingham and the 229 Club in London; they also played at the Purple Weekend Festival, in Le√≥n, Spain. Present Tense was released in November 2015 featuring 18 new songs written by Gregson.

The film, which was directed by John Guillermin, was shot on location in Czechoslovakia. It is based on the nonfiction book The Bridge at Remagen: The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945 by writer and U. S. Representative Ken Hechler. The screenplay was adapted by Richard Yates and William Roberts. The film is a highly fictionalized version of actual events during the last months of World War II when the 9th Armored Division approached Remagen and captured the intact Ludendorff Bridge. Instead of the real week-long battle and several artillery duels fought between the Americans and German defenders, the film focuses on the heroism and human cost in gaining a bridgehead across the Rhine before the Allies' final advance into Germany. It also omits the construction of bailey and pontoon bridges across the Rhine following capture of the bridge. The bridge itself was never rebuilt with the towers on each bank converted into a museum and arts studios. Plot The film opens with the U.S. Army failing to capture the still-intact Oberkassel railway bridge. Lieutenant Hartman (George Segal) is an experienced combat team leader who is becoming weary of the war in Europe. After he is promoted to company commander following the reckless death of the previous officer, Hartman is ordered to advance to the Rhine River at Remagen where he is promised a rest for his men. At the same time, Major Paul Kreuger (Robert Vaughn) of the Wehrmacht is tasked with destroying the Remagen bridge by his friend and superior, Colonel General von Brock (Peter van Eyck), who has been given a written order to do it immediately. The general appeals to Kreuger's sense of honor, giving him a verbal command to defend the bridge for as long as possible, to allow the 15th Army trapped on the west bank of the river to escape. After capturing the undefended town of Meckenheim, four miles from Remagen, Hartman is ordered by his battalion commander, Major Barnes (Bradford Dillman), to continue the advance until encountering resistance. Kreuger tours the defences above the town of Remagen and assures the handful of troops, which are just old men and boys, that the general personally guaranteed tank reserves are on the way. When Hartman's troops attack the town, Kreuger is shown the reality when he calls for the promised tanks and is told they have been sent \\"elsewhere\\". On finding the bridge intact, General Shinner (E. G. Marshall) orders Major Barnes to secure its capture, saying: \\"It's a crap shoot, Major. We're risking one hundred men, but you may save ten thousand\\". Barnes agrees to send in Hartman's company, and orders the troops to gain a foothold across the Rhine River, thus avoiding a costly assault-crossing elsewhere. Sergeant Angelo (Ben Gazzara), one of Hartman's squad leaders and friends strikes Barnes after the Major threatens Hartman. As the American soldiers rush the bridge, Kreuger, along with explosives engineer Captain Baumann (Joachim Hansen) and Captain Schmidt (Hans Christian Blech) from the Remagen Bridge Security Command, try to blow up the bridge, but the explosives they use prove to be not the high-yield military grade charges needed for the job, but weaker, industrial explosives, which fail to destroy the structure. Hartman's troops dig in to consolidate their hold on the bridge. Kreuger shoots two soldiers as they try to desert. Realising the futility of the situation, Kreuger returns to HQ to make a personal appeal to the general for more reinforcements, but on arrival finds that building taken over by the SS. Von Brock has been arrested for being \\"defeatist\\". Kreuger is questioned about the delay to blow up the bridge and arrested. At Remagen, Hartman leads a raid against a machine gun nest installed by Kreuger on board a barge moored to the bridge, but while taking its crew out, Angelo is hit and falls into the river. Hartman marches on foot towards the bridge defenders' post at the same time as a squadron of M24 Chaffee light tanks cross the bridge. The remaining German soldiers surrender to the Americans. In the aftermath of the battle, Hartman discovers Angelo alive. The next day, Kreuger is led out for execution by an SS firing squad. With the sound of airplanes overhead, Kreuger asks: \\"Ours or theirs?\\". The SS attending officer replies, \\"Enemy planes, sir!\\" \\"But who is the enemy?\\" muses Kreuger before he is shot. (In reality, Hitler ordered five men responsible for the failed defense shot: one was convicted in absentia, four others executed). A screen crawl informs the viewer that the actual structure collapsed into the Rhine ten days after its capture. Cast * George Segal as Lieutenant Phil Hartman (based on Lt.

Production =Development= In May 1958 film rights were purchased by Schulberg Productions, the company of Budd Schulberg who had witnessed the crossing and intended to film it as The Day We Crossed the Rhine. It was meant to follow Schulberg's film Wind Across the Everglades. Schulberg said Stanley Kubrick was interested in directing and the film would be made in Germany. Columbia agreed to finance. In November 1960 Schulberg said the film would start shooting in May 1961 with finance from The Mirisch Company and United Artists, however, the film was not made by Schulberg. In 1965 rights were bought by David Wolper. It was to be the first in a six-picture deal he signed with United Artists. Irvin Kershner was to direct. Roger O. Hirson was signed to do the script. A few months later, Richard Yates was reportedly working on the script. Later on William Roberts worked on it. These delays meant Wolper ended up making another war film first, The Devil's Brigade. Hechler says he was only offered $5,000 for the use of the book. \\"They told me if I held out for more money they'd change the name from The Bridge at Remagen to The Remagen Bridge and base it on newspaper accounts, which were public domain and covered the event widely at the time.\\" =Casting= By April 1968 George Segal had signed to star and John Guillermin to direct. Ben Gazzara then agreed to sign ‚Äì his first feature in three years. Robert Vaughn joined soon after. \\"I decided to get young actors,\\" said Wolper. \\"You can't get Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster ‚Äì who are older than General Eisenhower.\\" Filming West German officials would not allow the production to make the film in Germany because of shipping traffic on the River Rhine. There was an increasing trend at the time to film Hollywood films in Eastern Europe in order to save money ‚Äì The Fixer was filmed in Hungary and Castle Keep in Yugoslavia. According to a British press report it was decided to save ¬£833,000 of the ¬£2,100,000 budget by shooting in Czechoslovakia. =Czechoslovakia= Remains of a bridge in Davle, Czech Republic where scenes for the Remagen Bridge were shot Wolper paid $750,000 and Czech distribution rights to Barrandov Studios in exchange for their facilities and local labor. The American World War Two equipment was borrowed from the government of Austria, who had originally got it from the Americans. Filming started 6 June 1968 and was meant to go through until October. Shooting was difficult from the beginning. The production manager fell ill and the first assistant director quit. There were also clashes in work methods within the crew, of whom roughly 60 were imported from the west and 200 were Czech. However after an awkward start the Westerns and Czechs forged a decent working relationship. It was a period of political instability in Czechoslovakia. The film unit were accused by the Soviet and East German press of smuggling weapons into the country and being a cover up for the CIA. The Czechs did not take it too seriously, with Czech members of the crew jokingly referring to Wolper as \\"Mr CIA\\". Some government officials did inspect the arsenal of arms at Barrandov studios and found everything in order. Much of the Remagen town scenes were shot in the town of Most. The old town was being demolished and rebuilt at a new location at the time in order to make lignite lying under it accessible for mining. The Remagen Bridge scenes were shot at Davle on the Vltava River using the old bridge. Fake towers and a fake railway tunnel were constructed for the film. The film's opening scenes ‚Äì where the US Army fails to capture the Oberkassel, Bonn bridge ‚Äì were shot just south of the village of Vran√© nad Vltavou using the railway bridge which carries the Prague-Dob≈ô√≠≈° line over the River Vltava. During filming Guillermin told producer Wolper that he did not want the distraction of him being on set and he was therefore banned. Wolper responded by telling him that if he could not direct with Wolper on set, then he was therefore sacked. Guillermin apologised.John Guillermin Pendreigh, Brian. The Herald; Glasgow (UK) [Glasgow (UK)]10 Oct 2015. Wolper later called Guillermin \\"a real pain in tha ass\\". =Soviet invasion= On 20 August 1968, when the film was two-thirds complete, the Soviet Army invaded Czechoslovakia to reinstall a hard-line Communist government. Filming had to halt and the bulk of the cast and crew were stuck in the International Hotel in Prague. Wolper had flown out from Prague to Rome the night of the invasion. The cast and crew voted whether to stay or leave. Only three voted to stay - Guillermin and two stuntmen. Some cast and crew, including Shirley Temple Black, left in a 400-car convoy which took them to Pilsen and then to Nuremberg. A few hours later 79 cast and crew escaped in a 20-car caravan driven by Czechs. They travelled to Gmud in Austria, one hour before the border was closed, after which they travelled to Vienna. Items left behind included many personal possessions, the last five days' worth of filming and $1 million worth of equipment, including eight tanks and four cameras of unprocessed film. \\"It was just like an adventure movie,\\" said Bradford Dillman, \\"except the tragedy was real.\\" Some had had to flee to Vienna in 60-car convoy. Wolper said \\"circumstances have conspired to turn an innocent and expensive enterprise into a political football.\\" The issues caused the budget to increase from $3.5 million to $5 million. =Germany= Filming resumed in Hamburg West Germany, where there were ideal studio facilities, in October 1968. Unfinished scenes involving the bridge were shot at Castel Gandolfo in Italy. Wolper also negotiated filming of the blowing up of the bridge in Prague. Wolper later wrote \\"the actors get on the bridge in Czechoslovakia, remove explosive under the bridge in Germany and get off the bridge in Italy.\\" \\"If we bring some unity to this picture it will be a miracle,\\" said Vaughan.'Remagen' Now Filming in Hamburg By Bob Thomas The Washington Post, Times Herald 29 Oct 1968: B6. Wolper says the film had insurance to cover an invasion but that the insurance company argued that it was not an invasion, rather the government invited the Russians in. The matter settled and Wolper got some compensation but not the full amount. The Russian agreed to return the equipment. The film finished after 93 days. Accuracy According to Hechler, \\"although Hollywood has its own ideas of the truth, probably 95 percent of it is accurate. It was doubly exciting to see the good actors they got to portray it.\\" Hechler says the opening scene of the tanks going fast was not true. \\"They said it was more exciting that way. Also, there were several scenes with women, which I never saw in 1945. There's a little bit of a love interest there.\\" Hechler says the names of the participants were changed \\"I imagine to avoid lawsuits\\". Hechler said he was \\"very happy with\\" the film \\"because it brought attention to one of the great examples of the initiative and training of the American soldiers. They took advantage of an opportunity that had not been planned at all. It's also a tribute to the leadership of [Lt.] Karl Timmermann, who was the first officer who crossed.\\" Release The Bridge at Remagen was released in theatres on June 25, 1969. The ABC network broadcast the film on television in the U.S. on July 24, 1977. The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on January 24, 2006 and January 31, 2006. Wolper says \\"perhaps it was not the best idea to distribute a film about war and heroism at the height of the war in Vietnam. The film received mixed reviews. It was accused of being too realistic and not realistic enough... Given the circumstances, I think it is a fine picture and it plays quite often on television.\\" 2007 radio play In 2007, Vaughn played himself in a BBC Radio 4 dramatisation of the events surrounding the invasion.

At the 2001 census, it had a population of 1,747. The name derives from Pictish and Scottish Gaelic. \\"Pit-\\" represents Pictish pett 'place, portion of land', and \\"-enweem\\" is Gaelic na h-Uaimh, 'of the Caves' in Gaelic, so \\"The Place of the Caves\\". The name is rendered Baile na h-Uaimh in modern Gaelic, with baile, 'town, settlement', substituted for the Pictish prefix. The cave in question is almost certainly St Fillan's cave, although there are many indentations along the rocky shores that could have influenced the name. History Until 1975 Pittenweem was a royal burgh, having been awarded the status by King James V (1513‚Äì42) in 1541. Founded as a fishing village around a probably early Christian religious settlement, it grew along the shoreline from the west where the sheltered beaches were safe places for fishermen to draw their boats up out of the water. Later a breakwater was built, extending out from one of the rocky skerries that jut out south-west into the Firth of Forth like fingers. This allowed boats to rest at anchor rather than being beached, enabling larger vessels to use the port. A new breakwater further to the east was developed over the years into a deep, safe harbour with a covered fish market. As the herring disappeared from local waters and the fishing fleet shrank, this harbour and its attendant facilities became the main harbour for the fishermen of the East Neuk of Fife. The white houses with red roofs illustrate the classic East Neuk building style, influenced by trade with the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands). The East Neuk offered natural trading ports for Dutch and Belgian captains as they sailed up past the east coast of England. These ships brought red pantiles as ballast, and the locals soon found them to be excellent roofing material. One can just make out the \\"crow step\\" [Scots: corbie-steppit] gable: the gable ends rise in steps rather than the more normal smooth angled line ‚Äì an architectural feature imported from the Low Countries. These and other vernacular features are common throughout the town, which has one of Scotland's best-preserved and most attractive townscapes, with many historic buildings (some restored by the National Trust for Scotland). The 'organic' layout of the town centre grew up piecemeal over several centuries, with numerous winding streets and alleys. At the shore end of the outer harbour wall, some of the paving stones have numbers engraved on them. The numbers are now randomly scattered, but once were vital to the smooth operation of the fish market. Before the pier was resurfaced, the stones were placed in numerical order at the quayside running outwards from the shore. The first fishing boat to return with its catch placed its haul alongside stone number one, the second boat at stone two and so on. When the market opened, the fish was sold in strict order of landing. Cove Wynd ‚Äì a typical alley in Pttenweem In 1779 John Paul Jones (founder of the American Navy) anchored half-a-mile off Pittenweem in the USS Bonhomme Richard. Jones bombarded Anstruther, but did not attack Pittenweem. However he made off with the town's pilot who had sailed out to meet Jones' squadron. There is a feudal Lordship and Barony of Pittenweem created by James VI for Frederick Stewart in 1609. It was held by the Earls of Kellie until it passed to Sir John Anstruther and then to the Bairds of Elie. The current Lord Baron is Claes Zangenberg.http://baronyofpittenweem.com/reference/stories/full-grant.jpg Industry Pittenweem is currently the most active of the fishing ports in the East Neuk coast of Fife. Other primary industries are farming, tourism and, recently, arts and crafts. In former times, Pittenweem had two coal mines, one inland at Easter Grangemuir, the other at Pathhead, on the coast between Pittenweem and St Monans. A spin-off from the Pathhead mine was salt production. Receptacles below the tideline collected water that could be pumped up to salt-pans, the pans then being heated by coal fires fed from the mine to extract the salt. Evidence of the ash produced can still be seen on the coast. At one time the village was served by the Fife Coast Railway. Geography The village sits astride a raised beach. The lower part of the village has the harbour and the older houses. The upper part has the main shopping area, churches, school and the more recent houses. Pittenweem Primary School Education Pittenweem Primary School is a traditional village school with its own playing fields on the northern side of the older part of the village. It caters for children aged 4/5 to 11/12. Secondary education (up to ages 16, 17 or 18 depending on educational ambitions) is provided at Waid Academy in the neighbouring town of Anstruther. The nearest private educational institution is St Leonard's School in St Andrews, or the High School of Dundee. Religion Entrance to St. Fillian's cave In the Middle Ages, Pittenweem Priory was a small Augustinian monastery linked to that on the Isle of May and built over the ancient sacred cave associated with St Fillan. The cave, recently fitted out as a chapel, is situated in Cove Wynd (leading from the High Street down to the harbour) and is open to the public with the key available locally from the Cocoa Tree caf√©. From this rough dwelling St Fillan is said to have converted the local Pictish population. The cave was re-discovered around 1900 when a horse ploughing in the priory garden fell down a hole into it. The cave has flat rocks that are presumed to be 'beds' and a small spring of \\"holy water\\" at the rear. St Fillan's Cave was also used as a prison for witches during the witch hunts of the 17‚Äì18th centuries (see below). A shrine was dedicated to St Adrian on the Isle of May. It is said that St Adrian's men undertook the first harbour improvements, laying the foundation for the fishing industry, but no evidence for this currently exists. Parish Church and Tolbooth The present Church of Scotland parish kirk is on the site of the priory church. Much of the fortified east gatehouse of the priory survives (15th century), as does the 'Great House', one of Scotland's best-preserved late mediaeval houses, which may have served as accommodation for the prior and monks. As befits a village steeped in the dangerous and uncertain practices of fishing and farming, there are many churches in the village. Current denominations with churches include: Church of Scotland, Catholic, Episcopalian and Baptist. Other denominations have had churches or the equivalent, but these have been converted to other purposes. The \\"Church of Scotland\\" Church Hall, for example, was once the \\"Free Church of Scotland\\" kirk. The Catholic church of Christ the King will be suppressed on 25 November 2018. Uniquely the village experienced the beginning of a Pentecostal denominational church primarily led by the late Evangelist, Rev. Michael C. Newlands, a converted fisherman. The movement took a more established following in the village during the 1980s. Regular services were held in a local hall, on-site of a well known building among the local community. The late 17th to early 18th centuries saw a number of notorious witch-hunts by the local minister. The burgh was bogged down in debt and witchcraft was used as an excuse to improve the financial position by seizing the assets of some local women. The Church of Scotland building at the top of the High Street adjoined the Tolbooth which was used as the jail for some of the Pittenweem witches, and the door to the cells can still be seen. It is the studded door at the bottom of the tower. Culture Artists studio at 2016 Pittenweem Arts Festival In the late 1960s the local fishermen celebrated the re-opening of the re-designed harbour with a Gala Day, when the boats were dressed overall and people could take short trips on the boats. By the early 1980s, however, increasing regulation, higher fuel costs and a shrinking fleet were bringing this event to its knees. In its place in 1982 sprang up an Arts Festival, which initially incorporated the Gala Day as its finale. The Arts Festival has moved on somewhat, however, becoming one of the best-loved art festivals in Scotland with an estimated 25,000 visitors in 2013. Many artists have re-discovered the charms and the light of the area, which was always popular with itinerant and hobby artists, and have moved to the village, creating a vibrant artistic community. The village is home to a number of members of the Fence Collective, as well as the Scottish Collection of Art Extraordinary Gallery belonging to The Art Extraordinary Trust. Art Extraordinary (also known as Art Brut or outsider Art) arises from a powerful compulsion to create an inner personal vision. Pittenweem had the first newspaper in the area ‚Äì the Pittenweem Register (1844‚Äì52?). It caused a great stir in the town when the London daily newspapers contained extracts from the Register's eighth edition. There is also a fairly well-known song, \\"Pittenweem Jo\\", written in 1960. Politics The local Member of the UK Parliament (representing North East Fife) is Wendy Chamberlain of the Liberal Democrats. The local (representing Fife North East) Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) is Willie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. It is also represented by the MSPs of the Mid-Scotland and Fife parliamentary region. Pittenweem is in the East Neuk and Landward ward of Fife council and is represented by a number of members elected by Single Transferable Vote. From 1885‚Äì1983, Pittenweem was part of the East Fife Parliamentary constituency, its most famous MP being Prime Minister H. H. Asquith (Liberal) from 1886‚Äì1918. Sport The local football team is Pittenweem Rovers AFC. The local rugby team is Waid Academy FPRFC. The village also boasts a crazy putting course (open seasonal) and an outdoor tidal swimming pool at the West Braes area of the town.

Krishnan, was a pioneering Indian wildlife photographer, writer and naturalist. Early life M. Krishnan was born in Tirunelveli on 30 June 1912 and was the youngest of eight siblings. His father was a Tamil writer and reformer A. Madhaviah who worked with the Salt and Abkari Department of the Government of Madras. His father's writings included one of the first realistic Tamil novels, Padmavathi Charithram published in 1898 and an English novel Thillai Govindan published in 1916. His father voluntarily retired from Government service and started a press from which he published a Tamil magazine called Panchamritam. When his father died in 1925, he was taken care of by his eldest sister, Lakshmi. Krishnan studied in the Hindu High School and developed an interest in literature, art and nature. His family lived in Mylapore, and in those days it was covered in shrub and teemed with bird life, jackals and blackbucks. Krishnan even had a pet mongoose. In 1927 Krishnan joined the Presidency College and graduated with a BA in 1931. He also took a keen interest in botany, taught by Professor P. F. Fyson. He accompanied Fyson on field trips to the Nilgiris and the Kodaikanal hills and also acquired watercolour painting techniques from Professor Fyson's wife. Krishnan did not do well in his education and jobs were not easy. One of his older brother's who was married to the daughter of Sir T. Vijayaraghavacharya of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa, took Krishnan to his father-in-law for advice. Krishnan was told that unless he managed to do well in studies, he could not be helped. Writing For a while he made a living by writing to small magazines and publishing some of his drawings and caricatures. He initially wrote in several Tamil magazines.Baskaran, S. T. (ed.) (2002) Mazhiakalamum Kuyilosaiyum. Ma.KrishnanIyarkaiyiyal katturaikal. Kalachuvadu Pathipagam. In 1942, he was offered employment by the Maharaja of Sandur near Bellary in Karnataka. Krishnan took up this position and the works he undertook included being a schoolteacher, judge, publicity officer and a political secretary to the Maharaja. He spent a lot of his time wandering in the wilderness, observing nature, tried grazing sheep, breeding pigeons to work in a pigeon postal system and writing. His essays on wildlife photography were published in The Illustrated Weekly of India in a series entitled Wildlife Photographers Diary. He also wrote in The Hindu by the pen-name of Z. In the Sunday Statesman he wrote under his own name. In 1949, Sandur was unified in the Indian republic. From 1950 he wrote a bi-weekly column in The Statesman of Calcutta called 'Country Notebook'. In this column he wrote about various aspects of natural history. This column continued for 46 years, from 1950 to 18 February 1996, the day he died. Natural history Krishnan was an ecological patriot in that he opposed the introduction of exotic trees. He was once asked to speak at the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore and in late February, the Tabebuia trees were ablaze in flowers. Asked about his opinion on the flowers, he declared it as 'Disgraceful' and suggested that ... you should uproot all those foreign trees, and plant some of our own. Krishnan was responsible for the declaration of Vedanthangal as a bird sanctuary. He was aware that he was different from most conservationists of his time ‚Äì who were either European or were from the Indian aristocracy of Muslims and Rajputs often former hunters ‚Äì in being a vegetarian. It has been noted that in 1972, Krishnan foresaw the possibility that elephants could communicate using sounds that were inaudible to the human ear. This infrasound communication was confirmed by later studies by Katherine Payne.Payne, Katherine (1999) Silent Thunder: In the Presence of Elephants. Penguin. Photography Along with his whimsical prose, poetry and drawing he used photography as another tool for expression. He worked only with black and white film. His equipment was, according to naturalist E. P. Gee, 'a large, composite affair, with the body of one make and a tele lens of another, and other parts and accessories all ingeniously mounted together by himself. I cannot swear that I saw proverbial bootlace used to fix them all together, but I am sure there must have been some wire and hoop somewhere!' He called his equipment the Super Ponderosa. Krishnan was a not a big fan of technological advances and was unimpressed by the display of India's first jet aircraft. He declared them as mechanical, chemical and inhuman and was impressed more by the living muscular speed of animals... and if you want to see something sustained in its effortless, rhythmic impetuosity, you should watch a herd of blackbuck going all out for a few miles-there is tangible, real speed for you. Philosophy Krishnan was unhappy with the Indian system of school education. In a 1947 essay, he wrote, In 1967 he asked several university graduates to name two red-flowered tree or an exclusively Indian animal. Nobody passed his test and he wrote Writing about the Indian consciousness of nature he wrote He refused a paid invitation from Air India for a trip to London for eminent Indians. He refused on another occasion an invitation from the Smithsonian Institution. He was a fierce individualist and a recluse. Author Ramachandra Guha called him a self-reliant, Thoreauvian individualist who would not allow a mere government to pay for him. He however accepted the Padma Shri from the Indian Government in 1970.http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmashri_awards_list1.php?start=1960 In some of his writings he was critical and opinionated and was not well known for his diplomacy. He would refuse to let editors change his texts and that was his condition when asked to contribute a column. He fiercely argued that the usage Himalaya was correct and that a redundant 's' at its end did not respect its Sanskrit origin. Honours Krishnan was awarded the Padma Shri by the Indian government in 1960 for his work. and the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1968. His birth centenary in 2012, was commemorated by the Madras Naturalists' Society, Prakriti Foundation and the IIT Wildlife Club. The Madras Naturalists' Society which featured most of Krishnan's writings in their journal Blackbuck in the 1990s gives away the \\"M. Krishnan Memorial Nature Writing Award\\" annually.

The Marr‚ÄìHildreth edge detection method is simple and operates by convolving the image with the Laplacian of the Gaussian function, or, as a fast approximation by difference of Gaussians. Then, zero crossings are detected in the filtered result to obtain the edges. The Laplacian-of-Gaussian image operator is sometimes also referred to as the Mexican hat wavelet due to its visual shape when turned upside-down. David Marr and Ellen C. Hildreth are two of the inventors. Limitations The Marr‚ÄìHildreth operator, however, suffers from two main limitations. It generates responses that do not correspond to edges, so-called \\"false edges\\", and the localization error may be severe at curved edges. Today, there are much better edge detection methods, such as the Canny edge detector based on the search for local directional maxima in the gradient magnitude, or the differential approach based on the search for zero crossings of the differential expression that corresponds to the second-order derivative in the gradient direction (Both of these operations preceded by a Gaussian smoothing step.)

It was founded by the aeronautical designer Marcel Bloch (hence \\"MB\\" in the aircraft designations), who had previously played a major role in the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes A√©ronautiques, an early French aircraft manufacturer active largely during the First World War. Following the end of the Second World War, Marcel Bloch changed his name to Marcel Dassault (as in char d'assaut, French for \\"tank\\") due to persecution of Jews under the Vichy French regime. Accordingly, the company was also rebranded as Dassault Aviation, becoming a prominent manufacturer of jet- powered aircraft such as the Dassault Mirage III fighter and the Dassault Falcon family of business aircraft. History The origins of the company are closely associated with the activities of its founder, the French aeronautical designer Marcel Bloch. Having previously been a senior figure in the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes A√©ronautiques, an aircraft manufacturing company that produced largely numbers of aircraft for the French military during the First World War, Bloch had considerable experience in the field prior to founding his own company; however, due to a large of support from the French Government's aircraft manufacturing department to support the nation's manufacturers following the conflict's end and an associated downturn in aviation sales, Bloch had temporarily withdrawn from the sector during the late 1910s in favour of the real estate business. During 1928, the French state established a dedicated Air Ministry, signalling that government interest in the aviation sector had returned. In response, Bloch decided to found his own company, the Soci√©t√© des Avions Marcel Bloch, to resume aviation activities within. A key early order for Bloch was issued by the French engineer Albert Caquot, who sought a tri-engined aircraft suitable for postal services. During late 1931, the company received its first order from a French government entity. Accordingly, manufacturing activity commenced on both the MB.80, a single- engined aircraft orientated towards MEDEVAC operations, and the MB.120, a three-engined 10-passenger colonial transport aircraft, on behalf of the French Air Force. In response to rising demand for the company's produced, Marcel Bloch restructured the business, establishing separate design and manufacturing departments, while additional premises in the form of a garage in Boulogne were also arranged. During September 1932, for the purpose of manufacturing both production aircraft and future prototypes, Bloch also rented larger premises in Courbevoie. By 1934, Marcel Bloch recognised that France's aviation industry was approaching a manufacturing crisis, having anticipating shortcomings in production capacity and capabilities. Seeking additional capacity, Bloch reached an agreement with the aviation industrialist and past business associate Henry Potez, who owned the largest aviation company in France at the time. During January 1935, the two men cooperated to purchase another aircraft manufacturer, the Soci√©t√© A√©rienne Bordelaise (SAB) which, as the Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique du Sud-Ouest (SASO), was responsible for manufacturing both the MB.200 and MB.210 bombers. Separately, Bloch and Potez also purchased the majority of the shares of the Soci√©t√© des Moteurs et Automobiles Lorraine (SMAL) company. The 1930s was a time of considerable social upheaval in France; seeking positive relations with influential trade unions, Bloch engaged directly with their representatives, leading to numerous additional benefits being granted to the company's employees, such as a week‚Äôs paid leave from 1935. One year later, France's Popular Front-led government issued a policy permitting two weeks‚Äô paid holidays per year; in response, Bloch employees were given three weeks paid holiday per year. On 17 July 1936, the French government issued a new law that nationalised the nation's armament industry; this development heavily impacted for private aircraft companies as many were forcibly acquired and merged together. That year saw the creation of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich). On 16 January 1937, the Soci√©t√© des Avions Marcel Bloch was formally nationalised; its assets, including its factories at Courbevoie, Ch√¢teauroux-D√©ols, Villacoublay, Bordeaux, formed a major portion of the newly-established Soci√©t√© nationale de constructions a√©ronautiques du Sud-Ouest (SNCASO). Marcel Bloch was requested by the Minister for Air, Pierre Cot, to serve as the company's delegated administrator. While he had effectively lost ownership, and much of the control, of his company, Bloch was initially given a relatively free hand in the management of the development workshop. This independence was later curtailed via amendments to the original nationalisation act. During 1937, the French Government, recognising the looming threat of another World War with neighbouring Nazi Germany, launched a rearmament programme. Accordingly, the production of large numbers of capable combat aircraft to meet the challenge of the rapidly-expanding Luftwaffe was therefore a major national priority. The company's designs, such as the MB.150 single-engined fighter and the MB.170 twin-engined bomber, were amongst those aircraft produced to meet this demand. As well as entire aircraft, the production of propellers was a major undertaking of the firm, as they were procured by various other French manufacturers for their own aircraft. Both Bloch and Potez were active in efforts to expand manufacturing capacity, leading to purchasing of land in Saint-Cloud (the western suburbs of Paris) for the construction of a new factory in 1938. Following the outbreak of the Second World War during early September 1939, France's aeronautics manufacturing efforts reached a frantic pace, trying to satisfy the rapid order of thousands of airplanes, many of which had been placed too late to be fulfilled prior to the start of serious fighting in Western Europe. During the early months of the conflict, commonly referred to as Phoney War, Bloch accelerated production while endeavouring to achieve ever-greater performance from a series of rushed prototypes. On 15 February 1940, Marcel Bloch discontinued his involvement with SNCASO following a dispute with the French Air Ministry. Following the Battle of France and the Armistice of 22 June 1940 marking France's surrender, the French aviation industry, including all equipment, stocks and industrial establishments, were turned over intact to Germany. Accordingly, the French aviation industry was virtually disbanded in near-totality and aircraft manufacturing effectively ceased. During this period, Marcel Bloch was interned by Vichy France officials, while endeavours were made by the company to preserve its remaining interests, leading to the appointment of a board of directors, the issuing of articles of association, and Marcel Bloch's installation of chairman on 31 December 1940. Despite pressure to collaborate, Marcel repeatedly refused to cooperate with the Germans. In response, the Germans requisitioned the Saint-Cloud factory, placing its manufacturing activity under the control of the Junkers aviation company. Following the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp on 11 April 1945, Marcel Bloch was freed from German captivity. However, by the end of the Second World War, the majority of France's aeronautical industrial facilities had been reduced to ruins, while its design offices had been dispersed. Bloch, remaining confident in the demand for commercial aviation in the new postwar era, was keen to relaunch his company. Accordingly, it was rebranded as Dassault Aviation.

Founded on 27 December 1916 at Columbia University in New York City, it was originally called the American Metric Association. The USMA publishes a bi-monthly newsletter for its members on the state of the metric system in the United States: Metric Today. Background The Metric Act of 1866 declared the metric system to be \\"lawful throughout the United States of America\\" and in all business dealings and court proceedings. At an international commercial congress the Treaty of the Meter, also known as the Metre Convention (Convention du M√®tre) of 1875 was signed by 17 countries, including the US, making the metric system the international system of weights and measures. Note that this was a meeting of international states to facilitate commerce. This treaty, then, falls under the overview of the United States Department of State, which has devolved oversight to the United States Department of Commerce. The Mendenhall Order of 1893 scrapped the previously used standards and definitions for the yard, pound, gallon, and bushel. It adopted the standards of the metric system and redefined the yard, pound, gallon, and bushel in terms of metric units. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 started a voluntary metrication process in the US and, as amended by the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, declared the metric system to be ‚Äúthe preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce‚Äù. Mission of the USMA The US Metric Association (USMA) advocates the completion of the ongoing US conversion to the metric system, officially known as the International System of Units (SI). In support of this mission, the USMA provides a public medium for information and discussion, reports of metrication within the US, a history of the use of metric units in the US, a related bibliography including relevant laws, an answer source for industrial inquiries, a cadre of people knowledgeable about the metric system, training aids and supplies for educators and the public, a certification program that has been used in industry, and various citations and awards for those supporting this mission. The USMA is in cooperative communication with various state and federal governments, both legislative and executive, and various industrial and professional societies, such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), many of whom are involved in standards development. Short-term goals The labeling of some goods as to the amount included is regulated by the federal government, for example by means of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). Some goods are labeled by states or weight-and-measure districts, usually in a manner described by the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation (published by the National Conference on Weights and Measures). Some goods have no labeling guidance. =Complete adoption of the UPLR= The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) published a revised model Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation (UPLR) which went into effect on January 1, 2001. This has been adopted legislatively or by regulation by all but New York State. Once New York State adopts the UPLR, then goods sold in the US not subject to federal regulations and laws may have their contents labeled solely in metric units if that is the desire of the producer or manufacturer. Other producers and manufacturers may continue to provide dual labeling (metric and non-metric) if they so desire. Metric-only labeling would be merely an option. USMA would like to see the UPLR completely adopted. =Amendment of the FPLA= An amendment to the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) has been proposed and is awaiting approval by Congress. This would permit goods sold in the US subject to federal regulations and laws to have their contents labeled solely in metric units if that is the desire of the producer or manufacturer. Other producers and manufacturers may continue to provide dual labeling (metric and non-metric) if they so desire. Metric-only labeling would be merely an option. USMA would like to see this FPLA amendment adopted.

The river takes in the left tributary Mennin River, flows over Walker Falls, and takes in the right tributary Melgund Creek all near the settlement of Borups Corners, enters Dinorwic Lake, and flows into Wabigoon Lake, where it takes in the left tributary Crooked River. The Wabigoon River exits the lake at the northwest at Dryden, and flows northwest, through Wainwright Township dam and generating station (operated by Regional Power, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial), takes in the left tributary Eagle River, passes under Ontario Highway 105 at Upper Falls, then under Ontario Highway 609 and the Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line and over Quibell Dam the latter three at the settlement of Quibell. It then heads northwest to Clay Lake, takes in the left tributary Canyon River at Canyon Stretch, passes through Segise Lake, and reaches its mouth at Ball Lake on the English River, which flows via the Winnipeg River and Nelson River to Hudson Bay. Mercury pollution In 1962, Dryden Chemical Company began operating a chloralkali process plant in Dryden that produced chlorine and sodium hydroxide which were used at the nearby Dryden Pulp and Paper Company for bleaching pulp. Dryden Chemical Company dumped its waste water containing mercury into the Wabigoon River. The mercury pollution spread throughout the downstream Wabigoon-English River system. The mercury entered the food chain and accumulated in fish which were a major part of the diet for First Nations people on reserves at Grassy Narrows and Whitedog. This caused severe mercury poisoning with symptoms including neurological problems and birth defects among these people and also resulted in the closure of a commercial fishery and a fishing lodge in the area. In 1985, an agreement was signed which committed the federal and provincial governments and the two private companies involved to provide compensation. Dissolved mercury is now low in the river system and past concentrations are recorded in the sediments of Clay Lake.

Hospital radio has been found to be beneficial to patients, lifting their mood and aiding recovery. There are hundreds of hospital radio stations in the UK, almost all are members of the Hospital Broadcasting Association (HBA), which was set up by stations for their mutual benefit and does not govern or run them. Hospital radio stations are staffed and managed by volunteers. History Vinyl LPs in Walsall Hospital Radio's record library The earliest known hospital radio station officially commenced operation in the Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C., in May 1919. It was originally planned for installation in 1918 at the American \\"Base Hospital near Paris\\"; no evidence has come to light that it was set up there, so it is assumed that the First World War ended before this had been completed and that it was instead installed at Walter Reed. The first in the United Kingdom was installed at York County Hospital, England, in 1925. Headphones were provided beside 200 beds, and 70 loudspeakers were installed, with patients being able to listen to sports commentaries and church services. Throughout the 1930s radio stations began operating in a handful of other hospitals, with live music supplementing the speech-based programmes. Unsurprisingly, almost no new stations were started during World War II, the sole exception being on Jersey where a service was set up to relay church services, musical recitals, variety shows, and programmes for children to nine hospitals after wireless receivers had been banned and confiscated by the German occupying authorities. The spread of hospital radio services picked up slowly in the late 1940s. The 1950s saw a rapid growth in their number in the UK, with similar stations opening in Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. Many stations now played gramophone music to patients and, with the launch of the cassette tape in 1963, it became easy for presenters to record their programmes for playback at a later date. Hospital radio stations peaked in number in the 1980s, when up to 300 stations are thought to have been broadcasting on a daily basis. However as small hospitals closed or merged to form large regional medical centres, hospital radio stations also consolidated into a smaller number of larger organisations. New studios were built, often to a high specification, and in common with commercial radio, hospital stations began to use CDs to play music. Many now use a computer play-out system and are broadcast to patients bedsides via the hospedia and other TV and radio systems found on patients bedsides. Southend Hospital Radio in particular has switched from broadcasting via play-out systems to broadcasting via internet-enabled devices. Transmission In the past, hospital radio tended to be delivered to patients' bedsides by way of a dedicated cable link from the in-house studio to a unit beside every bed. In some cases, this unit would have supplied only the hospital radio station; in others, a choice of broadcast radio stations may also have been available. Today, higher quality bedside entertainment systems supplied by third party companies such as Hospedia (formerly Patientline), Premier Bedside and HTS (formerly Hospicom) carry many Hospedia York HospitalHospedia Newcastle Hospitals stations in the UK. Others are broadcast from a central radio transmitter, by virtue of a low- powered AM or FM licence. Many hospital radio stations also broadcast over the Internet. Organisation Each hospital radio station was founded independently and they are not centrally organised or managed. Almost all are members of the Hospital Broadcasting Association (HBA), which was set up by stations for their mutual benefit and does not govern or run them. Most in the UK are registered charities, others are part of larger organisations such as hospital Leagues of Friends. Hospital radio stations are staffed and managed by volunteers (more than 2,500 in the UK alone), and each volunteer is commonly attached to a particular weekly programme. Some broadcast, others work to keep the station's record library or computer systems up-to-date, but most also visit the hospital wards, to discuss the music that patients would like to hear, and to provide an opportunity for the latter to converse with a member of non-medical staff. Many stations use sophisticated computerised playout systems for music and jingles. Live programming is limited to the times that stations' volunteer members can attend studios - generally evenings and weekends - but many stations offer a 24-hour service by using computerised systems to play music and prerecorded programmes at other times. There are more than 230 hospital radio stations in the UK, and 170 in the Netherlands. Others operate in Germany, France, Norway, Australia, United States and New Zealand. Many professional radio presenters volunteered for hospital radio in their early career, as it provides a training ground for budding broadcasters.

Tiro's system consisted of about 4,000 symbols that in classical times were extended to 5,000 signs. During the medieval period, Tiro's notation system was taught in European monasteries and was brought to about 13,000 signs. The usage of Tironian notes declined after 1100 C.E. but were still in some use in the 17th century. A handful are still common today. Note on sign counts U+204A . Tironian notes can be themselves composites (ligatures) of simpler Tironian notes, the resulting compound being still shorter than the word it replaces. This accounts in part for the large number of attested Tironian notes, and for the wide variation in estimates of the total number of Tironian notes. Further, the \\"same\\" sign can have other variant forms, leading to the same issue. History =Development= Nicknamed \\"the father of stenography\\" by historians, Tiro (c. 103? ‚Äì 4 BC) was a slave and later a freedman who served as Marcus Tullius Cicero's (106‚Äì43 BC) personal secretary. Like others in his position, Tiro was required to quickly and accurately transcribe dictations from Cicero, such as speeches, professional and personal correspondence, and business transactions, sometimes while walking through the Forum or during fast-paced and contentious government and legal proceedings. The only systematized form of abbreviation in Latin at the time was used for legal notations (), but it was deliberately abstruse and only accessible to people with specialized knowledge. Otherwise shorthand was improvised for note-taking or writing personal communications and these notations would not have been understood outside of closed circles. Some abbreviations of Latin words and phrases were commonly recognized, such as those inscribed on monuments, but according to literature professor Anthony Di Renzo: \\"Up to this point, no true Latin shorthand existed.\\" Scholars believe that after learning about the intricacies of the Greek shorthand system, Cicero recognized the need for a comprehensive, standard Latin notation system and delegated the task of creating one to his slave, Tiro, whose highly refined and accurate method became the first standardized and widely adopted system of Latin shorthand. Tironian notes (), also known as Tironian shorthand, consisted of abbreviations with Latin letters, abstract symbols contrived by Tiro, and symbols borrowed from Greek shorthand. Tiro's notes represented prepositions, truncated words, contractions, syllables, and inflections. According to Di Renzo: \\"Tiro then combined these mixed signs like notes in a score to record not just phrases, but, as Cicero marvels in a letter to Atticus, 'whole sentences.'\\" Table with examples of Tironian notes which can be modified with various marks to form more complex ideas =Controversy= Dio Cassius attributes the invention of shorthand to Maecenas, and states that he employed his freedman Aquila in teaching the system to numerous others.Dio Cassius. Roman History. 55.7.6 Isidore of Seville, however, details another version of the early history of the system, ascribing the invention of the art to Quintus Ennius, who he says invented 1100 marks (). Isidore states that Tiro brought the practice to Rome, but only used Tironian notes for prepositions.Isidorus. Etymologiae or Originum I.21ff, Gothofred, editor According to Plutarch in \\"Life of Cato the Younger\\", Cicero's secretaries established the first examples of the art of Latin shorthand: =Introduction= There are no surviving copies of Tiro's original manual and code, so knowledge of it is based on biographical records and copies of Tironian tables from the medieval period. Historians typically date the invention of Tiro's system as 63 BC, when it was first used in official government business according to Plutarch in his biography of Cato the Younger in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans. Before Tiro's system was institutionalized, he used it himself as he was developing and fine-tuning it, which historians suspect may have been as early as 75 BC, when Cicero held public office in Sicily and needed his notes and correspondences to be written in code to protect sensitive information he had gathered about corruption among other government officials there. There is evidence that Tiro taught his system to Cicero and his other scribes, and possibly to his friends and family, before it was widely used. In \\"Life of Cato the Younger\\", Plutarch wrote that during Senate hearings in relating to the first Catilinarian conspiracy, Tiro and Cicero's other secretaries were in the audience meticulously and rapidly transcribing Cicero's oration. On many of the oldest Tironian tables, lines from this speech were frequently used as examples, leading scholars to theorize it was originally transcribed using Tironian shorthand. Scholars also believe that in preparation for speeches, Tiro drafted outlines in shorthand that Cicero used as notes while speaking. =Expansion= Isidore tells of the development of additional Tironian notes by various hands, such as Vipsanius, \\"Philargius\\", and Aquila (as above), until Seneca systematized the various marks to be approximately 5000 in number. =Use in the Middle Ages= Entering the Middle Ages, Tiro's shorthand was often used in combination with other abbreviations and the original symbols were expanded to 14,000 symbols during the Carolingian dynasty, but it quickly fell out of favor as shorthand became associated with witchcraft and magic and was forgotten until interest was rekindled by Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, in the 12th century. In the 15th century Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, discovered the notae Benenses: a psalm and a Ciceronian lexicon written in Tironian shorthand. Current A pay and display sign in Dublin with the Tironian for the Irish ('and'). A few Tironian symbols are still used today, particularly the Tironian , used in Ireland and Scotland to mean 'and' (where it is called in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic), and in the z of viz. (for in ‚Äì though here the z is derived from a Latin abbreviation sign, encoded as a casing pair U+A76A Íù™ and U+A76B Íù´). Tironian (with a glyph similar to the r rotunda) in the abbreviation in a German print from 1845, using Fraktur In blackletter texts (especially in German printing), it was used in the abbreviation = (for ) still throughout the 19th century. The Tironian can look very similar to an r , , depending on the typeface. In Old English manuscripts, the Tironian served as both a phonetic and morphological place holder. For instance, a Tironian between two words would be phonetically pronounced ond and would mean 'and'. However, if the Tironian followed the letter s, then it would be phonetically pronounced sond and mean 'water' (ancestral to Modern English sound in the geographical sense). This additional function of a phonetic as well as a conjunction placeholder has escaped formal Modern English; for example, one may not spell the word sand as s& (although this occurs in an informal style practised on certain Internet forums and sometimes in texting and other forms of instant messaging). This practice was distinct from the occasional use of &c.; for etc., where the & is interpreted as the Latin word ('and') and the c. is an abbreviation for Latin ('[the] rest'). Support on computers The use of Tironian notes on modern computing devices is not always straightforward. The Tironian is available at Unicode point U+204A, and can be made to display (e.g. for documents written in Irish or Scottish Gaelic) on a relatively wide range of devices: on Microsoft Windows, it can be shown in Segoe UI Symbol (a font that comes bundled with Windows Vista onwards); on macOS and iOS devices in all default system fonts; and on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux in the free DejaVu Sans font (which comes bundled with Chrome OS and various Linux distributions). Some applications and websites, such as the online edition of the Dictionary of the Irish Language, substitute the Tironian et with the box-drawing character U+2510 ‚îê, as it looks similar and displays widely. The numeral 7 is also used in informal contexts such as Internet forums and occasionally in print. A number of other Tironian signs have been assigned to the Private Use Area of Unicode by the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI), who also provide links to free typefaces that support their specifications.

While the band has undergone several line-up changes throughout its history, the classic line-up from the early 1980s featured bassist Wainwright, drummer Gary Maloney, Anthony \\"Bones\\" Roberts playing guitar, and vocalist Kelvin \\"Cal\\" Morris. The band is characterized by a minimalistic approach to music and lyrics, using a heavy, distorted, and grinding guitar-driven sound and raw, shouted vocals similar to a political speech, with lyrics on anarchist and pacifist themes, over intense drone-like rhythms. The band's sound has been called a \\"grave- black aural acid assault.\\"McPadden, Mike. If You Like Metallica...: Here Are Over 200 Bands, CDs, Movies, and Other Oddities That You Will Love. Backbeat Books, 2012. Section on \\"Discharge\\". Discharge \\"paved the way for an astounding array of politically motivated, musically intense and deeply confrontational bands\\". Discharge was \\"explicitly political\\" and used a \\"revolutionary/activist\\" attitude that moved hardcore away from its pub rock origins and towards a \\"dangerous and provocative\\" territory. AllMusic calls the band's sound a \\"high-speed noise overload\\" characterized by \\"ferocious noise blasts\\". The band's 1982 debut album, Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, went to number two on the UK Indie Charts and number 40 in the UK Album Chart. Treble magazine calls HNSNSN one of the ten essential hardcore albums, in a list that includes Black Flag's Damaged and the Dead Kennedys' Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables. In the early 1980s, numerous singles and EPs placed in the top 10 of the UK Indie Charts, including the 1981 EP Why? (#1) and the 1982 single State Violence State Control. HNSNSN paved the way for various extreme metal styles such as thrash metal, black metal, crust punk, and grindcore. The band's \\"brutal, extremist approach\\" and \\"extreme thrash noise\\" style of playing eventually led to the thrash genre.Knowles, Christopher. The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll. Cleis Press, 2010. p. 240. \\"Discharge's influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax and Sepultura have covered Discharge's songs in tribute.\\"Knowles,Christopher.The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll. Cleis Press, 2010 Discharge was a major influence on at least two generations of metal. Along with Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, Discharge have been credited for laying the groundwork for grindcore.Brown, Andy R.; Spracklen, Karl; Kahn- Harris, Keith; and Scott, Niall. Global Metal Music and Culture: Current Directions in Metal Studies. Routledge, 2016 The musical genre of D-beat is named after Discharge and the band's distinctive drumbeat. Career =Formation; classic line-up (1977‚Äì1979)= Discharge was formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent by Terence \\"Tez\\" Roberts (vocals) and Royston \\"Rainy\\" Wainwright (guitar). They soon recruited Roberts's younger brother Anthony \\"Bones\\" Roberts on lead guitar, Nigel Bamford on bass and Anthony \\"Akko\\" Axon (Allmusic gives the alternate nickname \\"Hacko\\") on drums. The musical style of the band was initially influenced by 1977-era punk bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Damned and The Clash. Engaging Tanya Rich as their manager, the band recorded their first demo, supported bands such as The Ruts, The Clash and The Damned at the Victoria Hall, Hanley, and began touring. Axon left later that year, followed by Bamford, and the band recruited their roadie Kelvin \\"Cal\\" Morris as vocalist, moving Terry Roberts to drums and Wainwright to bass. With Morris's addition, the group abandoned their previous Sex Pistols-influenced material and developed a new set of songs with a retooled sound. Anthony Roberts played guitar with a heavy, distorted, and grinding style and Morris shouted or screamed vocals without melody. The bassist played with an \\"immense gurgling over-driven\\" bass tone.Glasper, Ian. Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980‚Äì1984. PM Press, 2014. p. 189 The tempo of the band's songs also steadily increased over the next year or so. The stylistic transition made by the band was part of a broader trend in the early 1980s in the UK, which is known as \\"UK 82\\" or second generation UK punk. The new, harder-edged style also tended to use much darker, more nihilistic and violent lyrics, focusing on anarchist and pacifist themes while emphasizing the grisly effects of nuclear warfare and the social ills caused by capitalism. Like Crass, Discharge supported anarchism and displayed the anarchist symbol.Pellegrino, Anthony Michael and Lee, Cristopher Dean. Let the Music Play!: Harnessing the Power of Music for History and Social Studies Classrooms. IAP, 2012. p. 103 The band also expressed its political and social themes in its albums' artwork, which depicted the horrors of war using an iconic black-and-white photography style. One of the notable images is the \\"Impaled Dove\\" artwork from a 1930s John Heartfield anti-war poster, which depicts a dove impaled on a bayonet. The first gig with this new line-up and new sound was at Northwood Parish Hall. Among the audience was local record shop owner Mike Stone, who ran the Clay Records punk record label. =Early EPs; Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing (1980‚Äì1982)= In 1980, Discharge signed with Clay Records, and recorded their first single Realities of War in February 1980, which made the UK Indie Chart when it was released in April, after being played on BBC1 DJ John Peel's show, peaking at number 5 and spending 44 weeks in the chart. The band also performed their first shows outside of Stoke-on-Trent in 1980, playing in Leicester, Preston and Glasgow. After two further EP releases in that same year, founding member Terry Roberts departed, later joining UK Subs, to be replaced by Dave \\"Bambi\\" Ellesmere (formerly of The Insane) before the Why? EP was recorded. Ellesmere did not stay long, and the band replaced him with Garry Maloney of The Varukers on drums. Why? gave the band their first UK indie number one. Why? had cover photos showing the corpses of dead civilians. The song \\"Visions of War\\" had an \\"unrepentantly angry and punishing attack\\" and it became a signature song for the group. The songs \\"Maimed and Slaughtered,\\" \\"Does This System Work?\\" and \\"Mania for Conquest\\" set out the song and sound template for crust bands. At the same time, the record showed that it was possible for a hardcore band to incorporate the sonic power of \\"heavy metal without sacrificing ideology or anger\\". Discharge \\"...developed a brutal, extremist approach to punk that would give rise to thrash.\\" A reviewer from Punknews.org calls the music from this period \\"ugly and jagged without the artistic convolution of their no-wave contemporaries overseas\\", composed of \\"catchy, repetitive, stomping chords[,]...drumming that seems to emphasize creating a hellacious racket rather than keep a steady beat\\" and \\"very serious and socially conscious\\" song lyrics. The reviewer notes that \\"instead of creating a melody, vocalist Cal‚Äôs grunting shout...blends in with the rhythm\\", in effect becoming \\"a fourth [rhythm] instrument\\". Cal's lyrics and singing were \\"...short bursts of brutal sloganeering that made no concessions to melody or meter.\\"Knowles, Christopher. The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll. Cleis Press, 2010 Cal's deep \\"growl anticipated...[the] vocals that death metal and grindcore later\\" used. \\"Cal‚Äôs hoarse barking\\" sounded angry, and his anarchist lyrics \\"against government oppression and nuclear war, were like nihilist haikus, delivered without metaphor, nuance, or humour.\\" The band's songs were \\"played at warp speed, accompanied by a rumbling bass and a merciless, galloping drumbeat\\", with songs usually under two minutes and done at a fast tempo. The Punknews.org reviewer argues that the early 1981 EP Why? \\"...revolutionized everything...[paving the] way for the atonal shredding of hardcore punk, thrash, death metal, and grind, but also the dead-serious political ideals and brutal backing of crust hardcore\\". Ian Glasper described the EP as \\"one of the most potent anti-war records ever made\\".Glasper 2004, p. 171. Tom G. Warrior of Celtic Frost credited Discharge as \\"a revolution, much like Venom\\", saying, \\"When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far. And to me, they were unlike other punk bandsthey sounded more like metal.\\"J. Bennett, \\"Procreation of the Wicked\\", Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces, Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, p. 34-35. Discharge recorded their first album, 1982's Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing (HNSNSN), which was the number one punk album of all time in a poll by Terrorizer magazine. In David Konow's history of heavy metal, he calls the album the band's \\"...crowning achievement, a mercilessly brutal masterpiece.\\"Konow, David. Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal. Three Rivers Press, 2002. p. 239 The album reached number two on the indie album chart and number 40 in the UK Album Chart. In the early 1980s, \\"[i]conic punk fanzines like Flipside, which could make or break [band] reputations, pronounced them [Discharge] \\"fucking great.\\" Treble zine called it one of the top ten essential hardcore albums, along with Black Flag's Damaged and the Dead Kennedys Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables. Treble zine states that the music on HNSNSN was \\"much, much heavier\\" than previous punk and states that it influenced \\"punk rock, [and]... metal circles\\" with its \\"raw and intense\\" sound. Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian stated in 2015 that \\"You put on... Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing album now, and it‚Äôs still as heavy and brutal as anything out there.\\" The group played regularly throughout the UK, often appearing with bands such as GBH and The Exploited, and the success of the debut album also saw them touring Canada, the United States, Italy, Yugoslavia, Holland, Finland, and Sweden. The band had trouble getting into Canada at the border crossing at Buffalo, New York, as border guards thought the band looked like \\"animals\\". The lyrics on the album tended to be short political statements that were repeated. The album's title track, for example, consists of only three lines: \\"Lied to, threatened, cheated and deceived/ Hear nothing, see nothing, say nothing/ Led up garden paths and into blind alleys.\\" The song \\"Free Speech for the Dumb\\" is even more lyrically stripped down; it consists solely of the words from the title repeated emphatically. 1982's \\"State Violence State Control\\"/\\"Dooms'day\\" single garnered further critical praise, described in the fanzine Love and Molotov Cocktails as \\"...just about the most perfect realisation of a combination of the musical power of Mot√∂rhead and the lyrical mastery of Dead Kennedys at their best. Discharge are out there on their own, at the top of their game and it's hard to see how they can improve on this.\\" =Heavy metal crossover period; first breakup (1982‚Äì1987)= In 1982, Anthony Roberts left the group, later to form Broken Bones with his brother Tezz joining him. He was replaced by Peter \\"Pooch\\" Purtill (Allmusic and Glasper give the alternate spelling \\"Pyrtle\\" for his last name) who brought significant heavy metal influences. Purtill used a rock and metal style of guitar playing, including rock-oriented guitar solos. The Warning... EP shows drastic stylistic differences, with Morris changing his angry shouts to a mix of regular singing and football chants. Morris began to use a heavy metal, Ozzy Osbourne-influenced vocal style. As well, the band used significantly slower tempos and their D-beat punk style was replaced with metal-oriented beats. With the release of Ignorance, Purtill and Maloney left the band to form the punk/metal crossover band HellsBelles, to be replaced by guitarists Les \\"The Mole\\" Hunt and drummer Michael \\"Micky\\" Gibson. Following the later addition of second guitarist Stephen \\"Fish\\" Brooks, they released 1986's Grave New World, a mainstream metal album with a glam sound from Morris's high-pitched singing style. The album reached the indie top 10, but the band struggled with personnel problems as Morris departed and was briefly replaced by ex-Wrathchild frontman Rob \\"Rocky Shades\\" Berkeley the following year. The group disbanded shortly thereafter. =Reformation with new line-up (1990‚Äì1999)= Morris formed a new version of the band in 1990 with Andrew \\"Andy\\" Green on guitar, Anthony Morgan on bass, and Mika Karppinen initially playing drums, only to be replaced by the returning Maloney. The Live At The City Garden, New Jersey album on Clay Records followed. In 1991 they released Massacre Divine, which retained the metal sound, though with a noticeably harder edge than on Grave New World. Morris again changed his vocal style, this time to rougher growling, similar to Brian Johnson of AC/DC. They toured widely in support of the record, including their only visit to Japan, but the tour was negatively received. In 1993 they released Shootin' Up the World, which continued Cal's new vocal style, but the songs were significantly heavier than on Massacre Divine. The album retains the metal direction, although experiments with strange lyrics and song structures, coming close to thrash metal at times. Morris assembled further versions of the group, but they again disbanded in 1999. =Reunion of classic line-up and End of Days (2001‚Äìpresent)= Discharge performing in Rome in 2006. The distinctive lettering of the band's name can be seen in the banner at the back of the stage. In 2001, the classic line-up of Morris, Roberts, and Wainright reunited after meeting at a party held by original bassist Bamford, and in 2002 they released their self-titled album Discharge, a return to their early 1980s style featuring political commentary and aggressive playing. As well, they brought back their intense D-beat drumming style, although combined with the remaining metal influence, it gave the album a speed metal influence with its thrashy riffs. Morris would not commit to touring to promote the album and left the band, to be replaced by Anthony \\"Rat\\" Martin of The Varukers. The single \\"The Beginning of the End\\" was released in 2006, which marked a further step towards a return to the punk sound. Dave \\"Proper\\" Caution replaced Terence Roberts after his second departure this same year, and the group released the Disensitise album in 2008. In 2011 the band released an EP titled \\"Propaganda Feeds\\". In 2012 they released a split single with American band Off with Their Heads, released on Drunken Sailor Records. In 2014, they played the Black and Blue Bowl in Brooklyn, New York. Rat was replaced by Jeff \\"JJ\\" Janiak, while Tezz Roberts returned to the band, except this time on rhythm guitar rather than drums making Discharge a five-piece. On 3 June 2015, the group premiered a new song called \\"New World Order\\". An EP containing the song and a live recording of \\"Ain't No Feeble Bastard\\" was released on 16 January 2016, entitled New World Order. On 10 February 2016, the band announced that their 7th studio album, titled End of Days, was to be released sometime in April. It would be Discharge's first album with singer Jeff \\"JJ\\" Janiak and their first album as a five-piece band. On 3 March 2016, the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel uploaded a new song, \\"Hatebomb,\\" which would later on be available through other streaming services. The same day, the band released the track listing for End Of Days. End of Days, Discharge's seventh studio album, was released on 29 April through Nuclear Blast Records and entered the Official UK rock charts at #10 and on the indie charts at #23. The success of the album saw the band touring Europe and the USA. MetalBlast gave the album a positive review, stating that it \\"...showcases everything about the band that has earned them their legendary status. The guitar work is fast and brutal, that famous D-beat drumming pattern is in full effect, and the vocals are a gruff, angry bark.\\" The review states that the \\"songs are short, violent bursts of punk rock fury, brimming with an energy\\" with \\"a real sense of menace and sincerity in the tone\\" and it is \\"[r]elentless from start to finish\\". The production was praised as clear and \\"live\\"-sounding; the only negative comment was the lack of melody on the record. Influence ;D-beat The intense Mot√∂rhead- and Buzzcocks-influenced drum beat used by Discharge early in their career is referred to as D-beat (sometimes referred to as \\"discrust\\"). It became a subgenre of hardcore punk, especially in Japanese, Brazilian and Scandinavian hardcore punk scenes. D-beat music is known for its \\"grinding, distorted, [and] brutally political\\" style. Many bands that followed Discharge's stylistic approach, primarily in Sweden, began using the \\"Dis-\\" prefix and \\"-charge\\" suffix in their names, and even began using \\"Des-\\" words with \\"Dis-\\" in its place as a parody. Examples include Disaccord, Disfear, Disclose, Discard, Dischug, Recharge, Kegcharge, Disarm and Distraught. The bands who followed this naming trend also imitated Discharge's logo. This resulted in UK anarchist punk band Active Minds issuing an EP in 1995 entitled Dis Is Getting Pathetic, which parodied the cover of Fight Back. ;Influence on other genres As well as bringing the D-beat subgenre into existence, Discharge influenced bands operating within other types of extreme music.Decibel magazine states that there are \\"...few bands who have had more influence over so many different scenes than Discharge\\", including the first generation of thrash bands, grind and hardcore groups. \\"Discharge's influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax and Sepultura have covered Discharge's songs in tribute.\\" Some photos of Metallica, Anthrax and Exodus band members from the early 1980s show them wearing Discharge, Broken Bones and GBH shirts. Thrash metal groups like Metallica and Slayer were inspired by their speed and brutality. Anthrax was already playing Discharge cover songs by 1983. Oakland metal band Neurosis named Discharge's \\"Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing\\" (the title track of the album of the same name) as one of the top five UK anarcho-punk tracks. The band's singer/guitarist Steve Von Till stated that Discharge \\"...bridged the gap between Mot√∂rhead, Venom and punk rock\\" with their \\"huge fucking wall-of- sound guitar that was just ridiculously punishing, taking on heavy metal‚Äôs gain and volume but creating something totally unique and new.\\" They were one of the few British hardcore bands to be respected by the American hardcore scene; D-beats feature in the music of Siege, an American hardcore band who would influence powerviolence and grindcore. Along with Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, Discharge have been credited for laying the groundwork for grindcore. Early grindcore acts such as Napalm Death and Repulsion were influenced by Discharge, as were early death metal acts such as Celtic Frost and Nihilist. Discharge were also crucial to the development of crust punk, influencing many of the first crust bands, such as Doom, Hellbastard, and Antisect. ;Vocals James Hetfield of Metallica nominated Cal Morris for Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Singers poll. Cal was No. 17 on a list of 20 singers that James nominated. ;Cover songs Discharge's wide influence can also be seen in the range of cover versions recorded by hardcore punk and metal groups. The Scottish anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi covered the song \\"State Violence, State Control\\". During the same period, the Swedish hardcore punk band Mob 47 covered \\"Never Again\\" on their Ultimate Attack recording. New York City anarchist crust band Nausea, active from 1985‚Äì1992, recorded \\"Ain't No Feeble Bastard\\" along with \\"Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing\\", on The Punk Terrorist Anthology, Vol. 1. Swedish grindcore band Nasum covered \\"Visions of War\\" for a tribute compilation. The Southern band the Cooters covered \\"A Hell on Earth/Cries of Help\\" on their 2005 album Chaos or Bust. D-beat/hardcore punk band From Ashes Rise recorded the nuclear war-themed \\"Hell on Earth\\". In 2003, US hardcore band Ensign covered \\"Protest and Survive\\" on their album of covers Love the Music, Hate the Kids. Metal groups from several metal subgenres have recorded Discharge songs. Thrash metal bands covering Discharge material include Metallica (\\"Free Speech For The Dumb\\" and \\"The More I See\\", on their studio covers album Garage Inc.); Anthrax (\\"Protest and Survive\\" on their studio album Attack of the Killer B's); and Brazilian Sepultura (\\"A Look At Tomorrow\\", \\"Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing\\" and \\"Protest and Survive\\"). The groove metal band Machine Head covered \\"The Possibility of Life's Destruction\\" as a bonus track to their album The More Things Change.... Discharge songs also attracted interest from other metal subgenres, such as doom metal and grindcore. UK doom metal band Solstice covered \\"Protest & Survive\\", and Norwegian black metal band Carpathian Forest covered \\"The Possibilities of Life's Destruction\\" on their compilation album We're Going to Hell for This - Over a Decade of Perversions, while the grindcore/death metal band Napalm Death covered \\"War's No Fairytale\\" on their Leaders Not Followers: Part 2 album. As well, the Swedish melodic death metal pioneers At the Gates covered \\"The Nightmare Continues\\" as a hidden track on their With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness album. French doom/sludge band Monarch! also covered \\"A Look at Tomorrow\\" on their A Look At Tomorrow/Mass Destruction EP. UK drone / sludge monsters Moss covered 'Maimed And Slaughtered' on their 'Tombs Of The Blind Drugged' EP. The UK black metal band The Meads of Asphodel adopted a medley style cover of \\"Hell on Earth\\" and \\"Blood Runs Red\\" on their 2006 EP In the Name of God, Welcome to Planet Genocide. The Canadian industrial metal band Monster Voodoo Machine named their second album release State Voodoo/State Control after Discharge's \\"State Violence/State Control\\", and they included a cover version of \\"Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing\\", on their \\"Bastard Is As Bastard Does\\" single. Other metal bands covering Discharge songs include Soulfly (\\"Ain't No Feeble Bastard\\" and \\"The Possibility of Life's Destruction\\") and Machine Head (\\"The Possibility of Life's Destruction\\" on The More Things Change... digipack).

Science and observations One of the aims for the telescope during its development was to search for the highly redshifted 21-cm line radiation from primordial neutral hydrogen clouds in order to determine the epoch of galaxy formation in the universe. Astronomers from all over the world regularly use this telescope to observe many different astronomical objects such as HII regions, galaxies, pulsars, supernovae, and Sun and solar winds. In August 2018, the most distant galaxy ever known, located at a distance of 12 billion light years, was discovered by GMRT. In February 2020, it helped in the observation of the biggest explosion in the history of the universe, the Ophiuchus Supercluster explosion. Activities Each year on National Science Day the observatory invites the public and pupils from schools and colleges in the surrounding area to visit the site where they can listen to explanations of radio astronomy, receiver technology and astronomy from the engineers and astronomers who work there. Nearby schools/colleges are also invited to put their individual science experiments in exhibition and the best one in each level (primary, secondary school and Jr. college) are awarded. Visitors are allowed into GMRT only on Fridays in two sessions - Morning (1100 hrs - 1300 hrs) and Evening (1500 hrs to 1700 hrs).

Subsequently, a combination of features and power led to the rise of OpenGL, which became the most popular professional 3D API of the mid to late 1990s. Large vendors typically offered versions of PHIGS for their platforms, including DEC PHIGS, IBM's graPHIGS and Sun's SunPHIGS. It could also be used within the X Window System, supported via PEX. PEX consisted of an extension to X, adding commands that would be forwarded from the X server to the PEX system for rendering. Workstations were placed in windows typically, but could also be forwarded to take over the whole screen, or to various printer-output devices. PHIGS was designed in the 1980s, inheriting many of its ideas from the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) of the late 1970s, and became a standard by 1989: ANSI (ANSI X3.144-1988), FIPS (FIPS 153) and then ISO (ISO/IEC 9592 and ISO/IEC 9593). Due to its early gestation, the standard supports only the most basic 3D graphics, including basic geometry and meshes, and only the basic Gouraud, \\"Dot\\", and Phong shading for rendering scenes. Although PHIGS ultimately expanded to contain advanced functions (including the more accurate Phong lighting model and Data Mapping), other features considered standard by the mid-1990s were not supported (notably texture mapping), nor were many machines of the era physically capable of optimizing it to perform in real time.  Technical details  The word \\"hierarchical\\" in the name refers to a notable feature of PHIGS: unlike most graphics systems, PHIGS included a scene graph system as a part of the basic standard. Models were built up in a Centralized Structure Store (CSS), a database containing a \\"world\\" including both the drawing primitives and their attributes (color, line style, etc.). CSSes could be shared among a number of virtual devices, known under PHIGS as workstations, each of which could contain any number of views. Displaying graphics on the screen in PHIGS was a three-step process; first the model would be built into a CSS, then a workstation would be created and opened, and finally the model would be connected to the workstation. At that point the workstation would immediately render the model, and any future changes made to the model would instantly be reflected in all applicable workstation views. PHIGS originally lacked the capability to render illuminated scenes, and was superseded by PHIGS+. PHIGS+ works in essentially the same manner, but added methods for lighting and filling surfaces within a 3D scene. PHIGS+ also introduced more advanced graphics primitives, such as Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces. An ad hoc ANSI committee was formed around these proposed extensions to PHIGS, changing its name to the more descriptive and (optimistically) extensible name \\"PHIGS PLUS\\"  \\"PLUS\\" being a slightly tongue-in-cheek acronym for \\"Plus Lumi√®re Und Surfaces\\" (the two major areas of advancement over the base PHIGS standard).  The rise of OpenGL and the decline of PHIGS  OpenGL, unlike PHIGS, was an immediate-mode rendering system with no \\"state\\"; once an object is sent to a view to be rendered it essentially disappears. Changes to the model had to be re-sent into the system and re-rendered, a dramatically different programming mindset. For simple projects, PHIGS was considerably easier to use and work with. However, OpenGL's \\"low-level\\" API allowed the programmer to make dramatic improvements in rendering performance by first examining the data on the CPU-side before trying to send it over the bus to the graphics engine. For instance, the programmer could \\"cull\\" the objects by examining which objects were actually visible in the scene, and sending only those objects that would actually end up on the screen. This was kept private in PHIGS, making it much more difficult to tune performance, but enabling tuning to happen \\"for free\\" within the PHIGS implementation. Given the low performance systems of the era and the need for high-performance rendering, OpenGL was generally considered to be much more \\"powerful\\" for 3D programming. PHIGS fell into disuse. Version 6.0 of the PEX protocol was designed to support other 3D programming models as well, but did not regain popularity. PEX was mostly removed from XFree86 4.2.x (2002) and finally removed from the X Window System altogether in X11R6.7.0 (April 2004).

Life and work Floriani was born on 26 April 1585 in the town of Macerata to Pompeo Floriani and Claudia Rotelli. In 1606 he married Maria Fedeli, but she died in 1608 while giving birth to their daughter Camilla. In 1608 he went to Crema where he was employed by the governor of the city Orazio del Monte. In 1611 he went to Pesaro, and by July 1612 he was already highly regarded among the gentlemen of Macerata. In autumn 1612 Floriani settled in Madrid, Spain, where King Philip III commissioned him for a number of projects including to explore the fortifications of Algiers to plan a conquest of the city. In 1617 Floriani was sent to work for the Governor of Milan Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo, who had begun an extensive defensive engineering program. Floriani spent about a year in Milan, and although the King of Spain invited him to return to the Algiers project, he declined as he had been commissioned by Archduke Leopold V to fortify the town of Brisach in Hungary. He then took part in strengthening the defences of Pressburg and Vienna. He was present at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. Within the next couple of years he designed both military and non-military buildings in other cities including Altenburg, until he resigned as a military engineer in 1624. He then had a successful military career and was eventually appointed as a warden in Castel Sant'Angelo in December 1627. He then married Lucrezia Gardina, the widow of Lorenzo Costa. In early 1629 he was appointed by Carlo Barberini and so he went to Ferrara, and he also worked for Pope Urban VIII. Floriani designed the Floriana Lines In 1635, the Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John Fra Antoine de Paule invited Floriani to discuss how to strengthen the landward fortifications of Valletta, the capital city of Malta, over which the Order was sovereign. A line of fortifications was designed by Floriani, and these became known as the Floriana Lines. The area between Valletta and the new fortifications eventually became a town in its own right, and was named Floriana after the engineer. In 1637 he went to Rome and to his hometown Macerata, before being called back to Ferrara. He died there on 27 May 1638. Floriani had written his will in 1632 in which he asked to be buried with his brother Felice who had died in 1630 at the church of Santa Croce in Macerata. The church was later destroyed by the French in 1799.FLORIANI, Pietro Paolo. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 48 (1997). Retrieved 14 June 2014. Legacy Floriani is a key figure in his native town of Macerata and throughout the region of the Marche due to his multifaceted personality which is revealed in two of his annotated manuscripts from the Compagnoni Floriani di Macerata with sketches of theatrical scenes. He is also widely remembered as an architect for designing the Floriana Lines and being the namesake of Floriana. In 2006, a documentary was made about his life, although it included some fictional elements as well. The town of Floriana was twinned with Macerata in 2007. The Floriana Local Council also built a statue of the architect in Pjazza Robert Samut. The monument was designed by a young Maltese architect Chris Ebejer and was unveiled on 17 April 2009 by the Mayor of Floriana Nigel Holland, in the presence of the Mayor of Macerata, Giorgio Meschini and Countess Carla Compagnoni Floriani, a descendant of the engineer, and other guests.The Floriani Monument .

Mezhbizh) is a town in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. It is located in the Letychiv Raion (district), 25 kilometres from Khmelnytskyi on the main highway between Khmelnytskyi and Vinnytsia at the confluence of the Southern Buh and Buzhok rivers. Medzhybizh was once a prominent town in the former Podolia Province. Its name is derived from \\"mezhbuzhye\\", which means \\"between the Buzhenka (and the Buh) Rivers\\". It is known as the birthplace of the Jewish Hasidic mystical religious movement. Current population: History =Earliest history= Medzhybizh Castle in 1850 The Orthodox church under renovation inside Medzhybizh castle. Originally built in 1586 as a Polish Catholic church. 19th-century mill buildings adjacent to the mill dam and the lake on the Southern Bug Medzhybizh is first mentioned in chronicles as an estate in Ktivan Rus. It was given to Prince Svyatoslav by the prince of Kyiv in the year 1146. In 1148, ownership transferred to Rostyslav, the son of Yuri Dolgoruky. The wooden fortress that stood there was destroyed in 1255. After the Mongol incursion, by 1360, the town and surrounding territory passed into the hands of the Lithuanians. The town suffered from numerous attacks by the Tatars in 1453, 1506, 1516, 1546, 1558, 1566, and 1615. In 1444 the town was incorporated into lands administered by Poland. In the 16th century, the territory was controlled by the Sieniawski and Potocki Polish noble families. In 1511 work began to replace the wooden palisades with massive stone fortifications, many of which can still be seen today. A dam was built across the Southern Bug river to provide a defensive lake, and a rhomboid Medzhybizh Castle with four towers was built. The state-of-the-art fortifications made Medzhybizh one of the strongest military sites in the region and led to the rise of its prosperity in the next three centuries. \\\\- In 1571 a census was recorded, listing the population as being made up of 95 Ruthenians, 35 Jews, and 30 Poles. In 1593 Adam Sienawski gave the town Magdeburg rights. In the mid-16th century the Zas≈Çawski family, a Polish noble family, turned Medzhybizh into an impregnable fortress. The Zaslavskys used Medzhybizh as their base from which to defend the southern borders from the incursions of the Ottoman Turks and Crimean Tatars. =The Cossack uprising of 1648= In 1648 the cossack uprising led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky captured the town 3 times and held the region for the period of 1 year. At the time, there were approximately 12,000 residents living in Medzhybizh and its environs. Of this number there were 2500 Jews living in Medzhibozh in the year 1648 out of a total Jewish population of Podolia of 4000 souls (spread between 18 communities). The massacre of Jews by the Cossacks under the command of Danylo Nechay and Maksym Kryvonis occurred July 20, 1648 in Medzhybizh, almost all 2500 Jews were either killed or taken into captivity at the time of the massacre.Bernard Weinryb \\"The Jews of Poland\\",1973, p. 316.\\"The Road from Letichev\\" (2000), volume 1, page 37 The Jewish population in Medzhybizh was virtually eradicated, and there were no burials recorded for several years after 1648, consistent with depopulation. Jan Casimir and Khmelnitsky negotiated a treaty in 1649, however, the hostilities continued in 1651 and 1653. In 1657 the Hungarian Prince R√°k√≥czi took the city, ceding it to the Turks in 1672. It remained under their administration until 1682. By 1661, only a handful of Jews remained in Medzhybizh. In the 1678 census their numbers increased to 275 souls. =Turkish rule and later Polish period= Weakened by the Cossack uprising, Podolia was invaded and occupied by Turkey in 1672. Medzhybizh became part of the Turkish Eyalet of Kamieniecki as \\"Mejibuji\\" and was a sanjak center. In 1682, Medzhybizh was recaptured by the Poles under Jan Sobieski. However, Poles didn't regain full control until 1699 because the town was frequently ravaged by ongoing struggles between the Poles and Turks. After Medzhybizh was recaptured from the Turks, it went through what many consider its golden age during the 17th and 18th centuries. Under the Sieniawski family and later the Czartoryski family, the town prospered. Medzhybizh successfully defended itself from several Haidamak attacks. By the mid-18th century, Medzhybizh was the seat of power in Podilia Province. It had a population of nearly 5,000 of which there were 2,500 Jews. Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko in Medzhybizh In 1790 45-years old Ko≈õciuszko, who garrisoned here, fell in love with 18-years old Tekla Zurowska. There are known several love letters. Due to age and apparent lack of financial resources on the side of Ko≈õciuszko, the parents didn't consent to wedlock, despite the fact the love was reciprocated. =Russian rule= In 1793, Medzhybizh fell into Russian hands during the second partition of Poland. The Czartoryski family continued to own the town until Prince Adam Czartoryski was forced into exile in 1831. During Russian rule, the seat of power for Podilia moved from Medzhybizh to Kamianets-Podilskyi. The economy of Medzhybizh deteriorated because the railroad line bypassed the town to the south. The nearby town of Letychiv, however, flourished. In the late 1880s through World War I, Medzhybizh became a center of military activity, housing an important garrison within its castle grounds. A commemorative plaque marks the place where the famous Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko stayed in October 1846 participating in an archeological expedition. It is here that he composed his famous poem \\"Rozryta mohyla\\" - \\"The Ransacked Grave\\". =Soviet rule= After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the territory was occupied by German and Hungarian troops until the end of World War I. Medzhybizh was the scene of numerous pogroms during the Russian Civil War (Ukrainian Civil War) of 1919‚Äì1922. The town changed hands many times as different militia units from either the Bolsheviks, Ukrainian Nationalists, Poles, or Whites gained temporary control. What little wealth was left was stripped in these pogroms, turning the entire area into ruins. Under Soviet rule starting 1922, the region's economy improved. Electricity, schools, roads and other infrastructure were built. Several kolkhozi (collective farms) were established near Medzhybizh. In the early 1930s, pressure from the government to break the peasant resistance to collectivization resulted in famines throughout Ukraine. Recently a museum dedicated to the memory of the many local inhabitants who died during the Holodomor was opened in Medzhybizh containing original documents from the area relating to the shooting of all villagers who opposed entering the kolhoz collective farms.medzhibozh.info (Russian) =World War II= Monument to the approximately 3,000 Medzhybizh Jews who were executed in three nearby ravines in 1942 Medzhybizh fell to German troops during Operation Barbarossa on July 8, 1941 with relatively light resistance. It remained under German occupation until it was liberated by Soviet forces on March 24, 1944. Medzhybizh was astride an important east‚Äìwest supply road that the German occupant's administration wanted to expand into an autobahn-like highway. This road led directly between the city of Proskuriv (now Khmelnytskyi) and routes westward into Germany and the city of Vinnytsia with routes to the eastern front. Vinnytsia was the site of Hitler's headquarters bunker in Soviet territory where he personally directed the war between 1942 and 1943. The German Nazis set up Jewish ghettos in Medzhybizh and in Letychiv to assist Organisation Todt in providing slave labor for the road building project. Because of this special road project, Medzhybizh retained its Jewish population longer than most of the surrounding communities, where Einsatzgruppen units executed entire populations of Jews shortly after the beginning of German occupation. When the road project was completed in the summer of 1942, the Einsatzgruppen units were called in and three separate mass shootings of Jews occurred between August 21, 1942 and October 31, 1942 that murdered all Jews in the ghetto. Soviet authorities reported that a total of 2,558 Jews were murdered in ravines to the west of town. Roman Shukhevych, commander of the Nachtigall Battalion stopped in Medzhybizh and there refused to fight against the Soviets for the Nazis until Yaroslav Stetsko was released from custody. The Battalion was disarmed and sent to Germany. =Post World War II Soviet rule= In 1959 the main Uspenska Cathedral was destroyed and the stones used for roads to the various farms around the city. In 1965 the Dominican Cathedral was blown up. =Medzhybizh today= A large museum in memory of the victims of the Holodomor is located in the fortress. There is a number of expositions available to visitors explaining the tragic events of 1930‚Äì1932. The castle houses a small museum devoted to the Ukrainian history of the town. Several Jewish sites are either being restored or were recently renovated as they have become an important Jewish tourist attraction. The old Jewish cemetery is the site of ongoing restoration efforts. The location of its famous graves are now protected by a modern building. The Apter Rav's shul is currently undergoing renovation. A complete re-creation of the Besht's shul was recently constructed on its original site. A new hachnosas orchim building has been erected in 2012 and for this upcoming year 2015 on the Yom Hillula of the Baal Shem Tov that falls in Shavuos another building to accommodate over 200 guests for sleeping. Yisroel Meir Gabbai of Oholei Tzadikim, has built a mikvah connected and right by the spring of where the Baal Shem Tov use to immerse himself. The project took five years and cost an estimated $500,000. The premises are accessible 24 hours a day.

Another view of the Baal Shem Tov's Shul, c. 1915 Interior of the Baal Shem Tov's Shul, c. 1915 Medzhybizh was the center of Jewish culture in its region in Ukraine. The first records of Jews in Medzhybizh date back to the early 16th century. These records state that various Jews were granted special privileges by the Polish kings, including a proclamation in 1566 by King Sigismund II Augustus that the Jews of Medzhybizh were exempt from paying taxes in perpetuity. The earliest known burial in the Jewish cemetery dates from 1555. Many key rabbinic leaders lived in Medzhybizh during the 17th through 20th centuries. The earliest important rabbi to make Medzhybizh home was Rabbi Joel Sirkes (1561‚Äì1640), a key figure in Judaism at that time. He lived in Medzhybizh from 1604‚Äì12. The most important Hasidic rabbi from Medzyhbizh was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer Baal Shem Tov \\"Besht\\" (1698‚Äì1760), the founder of Hasidism. He lived in Medzhybizh from about 1742 until his death in 1760. His grave can be viewed today in the Medzhybizh old Jewish cemetery. The Baal Shem Tov is considered one of the key Jewish personalities of the 18th century who has shaped Judaism into what it is today. His work led to the founding the Hasidic movement, established by his disciples, some of whom also lived in Medzhybizh, but most of whom traveled from all over Eastern Europe, sometimes from great distances, to visit and learn from him. In Medzhybizh, the Baal Shem Tov was also known as a \\"doktor\\" and healer to both Jews and non-Jews. He was known to have been given a special tax-free dispensation by the Czartoryski family and his house shows up on several town censuses. There were two fundamentally different rabbinic leaders in the town, those who were Hasidic and those who were not. In general, both groups got along, but the followers of the Hasidic leaders emphasized certain aspects of Judaism, such as emotions in observance of the commandments and ritual purity. The non-Hasidic leaders tended to follow a scholarly path and were more responsible for the Jewish institutions, such as observance of kashrut, the social structure of the town, liaison with the town's nobles, and control of the Jewish court. Hasidic leaders included Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh (1757‚Äì1811), the Baal Shem Tov's grandson. Rabbi Boruch was notable for his principle of malkhus (\\"royalty\\") and conducted his court accordingly. He was also known for his \\"melancholy\\" and he had a fiery temper. Many of his grandfather's disciples and the great Hasidic leaders of the time, regularly visited Rabbi Boruch, including the Magid of Chernobyl, the Magid of Mezritch, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (founder of the Chabad Hasidic movement), and others. In an attempt to remedy Rabbi Boruch's melancholy, his followers brought in Hershel of Ostropol as a \\"court jester\\" of sorts. Hershel was one of the first documented Jewish comedians and his exploits are legendary within both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Hershel is also buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh, though his grave is unmarked.

R., 1961, Filled with Laughter: A Fiesta of Jewish Folk Humor: Thomas Yoseloff, p. 183-184. Rabbi Nachman of Breslav (1772‚Äì1810), the Baal Shem Tov's great-grandson, was born in Medzhybizh but left at an early age. He became the founder of the Breslover Hasidim. Another Hasidic leader, Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt (1748‚Äì1825) \\"The Apter Rov\\", made Medzhybizh his home from 1813 until his death in 1825. The Apter Rov is also buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh, very close to the Baal Shem Tov's grave. The Heshel family became one of the foremost Hasidic rabbinic dynasties and various descendants remained in Medzhybizh well into the 20th century. The non-Hasidic rabbinic leadership of Medzhybizh was controlled by the Rapoport-Bick dynasty, the most important of all the non-Hasidic rabbinic dynasties of Medzhybizh. Rabbi Dov Berish Rapoport (d. 1823) was the first to make Medzhybizh his home. He was the grandson of Rabbi Chaim haCohen Rapoport of Lviv (d. 1771), a notable sage during the mid-18th century. Dov Berish Rapoport's grave can be seen today at the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh. Other rabbis of this dynasty include Rabbi Isaac Bick (1864‚Äì1934) who immigrated to America in 1925 and founded a synagogue in Rhode Island. Rabbi Chaim Yekhiel Mikhel Bick (1887‚Äì1964) was the last known rabbi to reside in Medzhybizh. He left Medzhybizh for New York in 1925. It is not known whether Medzhybizh had another rabbi when it served as a Jewish ghetto in World War II. The Rapoport Dynasty traces its roots back to Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697‚Äì1776) who was involved in the Frankist debates and his father Rabbi Tsvi Hirsh Ashkenazi, known as the Chacham Tsvi (1660‚Äì1718). The Rapoports themselves are a long distinguished rabbinic family who traces their roots back to Central Europe and Northern Italy in the 15th century. The first Rapoport rabbi to make his home in Medzhybizh was Rabbi Dov Berish Rapoport (d. 1823). He was the grandson of Rabbi Chaim haCohen Rapoport of Lviv (d. 1771), who was also involved in the Frankist debates. Rabbi Dov Berish became the head of the Jewish court (Av Beth Din) and leader of the entire Jewish community of Medzhybizh. However, in a dispute with Rabbi Moshe Chaim Ephraim, the Baal Shem Tov's grandson around the year 1800, the non-Hasidic and the Hasidic communities separated into two leadership groups. The Rapoport/Bick family continued to control the town's Jewish religious court. The Hasidic community at the time chose Rabbi Issachar Dov-Ber Landa to represent them in official matters. Both Rabbis Rapoport and Landa are buried side by side in the Medzhybizh Jewish cemetery, just a few steps away from the Baal Shem Tov's grave. =Jewish institutions in Medzhybizh= 18th-century gravestones at the old Jewish cemetery in Medzhybizh Gravestone of the Baal Shem Tov in Medzhybizh Medzhybizh was the home to at least two synagogue buildings and numerous small minyanim. One synagogue still stands today but is used for other purposes. It was the synagogue of R. Avraham Yehoshua Heshel, the Apter Rov. In early 2008, it was bought by the Ohalei Zaddikim organization and is slated for reconstruction. The other synagogue, the Baal Shem Tov's old wooden synagogue, was torn down for firewood during World War II. It has recently been rebuilt according to plan. Medzhybizh also contains two Jewish cemeteries. The old Jewish cemetery contains the grave of the Baal Shem Tov and other famous and notable Jews. It has turned into something of a tourist attraction, a magnet for Hasidic Jews from all over the world. The new Jewish cemetery has graves from the early 19th century through to the 1980s. A Nazi mass killing site outside of town holds the graves of almost 3,000 Jews in 3 different trenches. Sites to see Today, Medzhybizh is dominated by a castle and fortifications built during the Polish period. Many of these fortifications are deteriorating, however inside the castle is a museum which describes some of the history of the area. The castle itself consists of four towers and overlooks the main road and the dam. Just outside the castle, the dam and the lake are still in working order. Adjacent to the dam are two old mill buildings that are no longer used but used to be a valuable concession (arenda) during Tsarist and Polish times. North of town is the old Jewish cemetery, which has turned into a tourist attraction primarily for Hasidic Jews making a pilgrimage to see the Baal Shem Tov's grave. Legend has it that this cemetery remained protected and well-preserved during World War II because the local Ukrainian population remembered the Baal Shem Tov's healing powers during his lifetime and they were afraid of his powerful magic even beyond the grave. The old Jewish cemetery contains a modern building over the graves of the important Jewish dignitaries. Other gravestones in this cemetery are worth visiting as the artwork on many stones shows a level of cultural achievement matching the rise of importance of the town. The oldest burial in this cemetery dates from 1555. Toward the central western portion of the town is the new Jewish cemetery, which is only in fair condition. Here Jews are buried from the early 19th century through modern times. Outside of town to the west, and adjacent to the Southern Bug river, is the Nazi mass killing site where approximately 3,000 Jews were buried. A monument marks the site. The three ravines that hold the graves are covered in concrete.

Early life Kinnear was the younger son of the wealthy Edinburgh architect Charles George Hood Kinnear and his wife Jessie Jane and came from the same banking family (Thomas Kinnear & Company) as Sir William Jardine (Kinnear's great-grandfather). Kinnear studied at Edinburgh Academy before moving to Trinity College, Glenalmond. He worked as an assistant in an estate in Lanarkshire before he followed his interest in natural history and volunteered at the Royal Scottish Museum with W. Eagle Clarke in 1905‚Äì1907. He joined Eagle Clarke to Fair Isle. In 1907, he went aboard a whaling ship around Greenland to collect bird specimens. Career On a recommendation by William Eagle Clarke, he went to India to become curator of the museum of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), a position he held from 1 November 1907 to November 1919. He was also assistant editor of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. In 1913, he married Gwendolen Beatrice Millard, daughter of Edinburgh physician William Wright Millard, a relative of Walter Samuel Millard at the BNHS. He helped the BNHS organize its survey of Indian mammals which were begun around 1911. When the First World War broke out, he attempted to join the Indian army. He served briefly in the Bombay volunteer rifles and as an intelligence officer in the defense of Bombay port between 1915 and 1919. During this time, he prepared a booklet on the animals of Mesopotamia. Natural History Museum In 1920 he returned to Britain and became an assistant in the Department of Zoology at the Natural History Museum, becoming Keeper of Zoology in 1945. At the age of 65 in August 1947, then the normal age of retirement, the trustees decided to appoint him as director of the museum. He was appointed a CB in 1948. He retired on 30 April 1950 and was knighted in June of that year. Board memberships and other activities Kinnear was editor of the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club from 1925 to 1930 and president of the British Ornithologists' Union (which he joined when he was 20) from 1943 to 1948. He was a member of the International Council for Bird Preservation from 1935 and was involved in the drafting of the Protection of Birds Act of 1954. He served on the Councils of the National Trust and the Zoological Society. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. He had a great interest in the writings of the naturalists on the voyages of James Cook. Kinnear was one of the founders of the Society for the History of Natural History. He wrote two papers in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society on the history of Indian ornithology and mammalogy. He edited editions of the Popular Handbook of Indian Birds written by Hugh Whistler after the death of its author. His other hobbies were fishing and gardening. Death He died on his 75th birthday at his home on Burghey Road, Wimbledon.

Claims of medical malpractice, when pursued in US courts, are processed as civil torts. Sometimes an act of medical malpractice will also constitute a criminal act, as in the case of the death of Michael Jackson. Medical professionals may obtain professional liability insurances to offset the costs of lawsuits based on medical malpractice. Further establishment of conditions of intention or malice may be applied where applicable.  Frequency and cost of medical errors  Back in 1984, the extrapolated statistics from relatively few records in only several states of the United States estimated that between 44,000-98,000 people annually die in hospitals because of medical errors. Much work has been done since then, including work by the author of that study who moved on from those low estimates back in the 1990s. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that 75,000 patients die annually, in hospitals alone, from infections alone - just one cause of harm in just one kind of care setting. From all causes there have been numerous other studies, including \\"A New, Evidence-based Estimate of Patient Harms Associated with Hospital Care\\" by John T. James, PhD that estimates 400,000 unnecessary deaths annually in hospitals alone. Using these numbers, medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the United States, only behind heart disease and cancer. Less than one quarter of care takes place in hospitals. Across all care settings the numbers are higher. Another study notes that about 1.14 million patient-safety incidents occurred among the 37 million hospitalizations in the Medicare population over the years 2000-2002. Hospital costs associated with such medical errors were estimated at $324 million in October 2008 alone. Approximately 17,000 malpractice cases are filed in the U.S. each year. The medical malpractice claim =The parties= The plaintiff is/ was the patient, or a legally designated party acting on behalf of the patient, orin the case of a wrongful death suitthe executor or administrator of a deceased patient's estate. The defendant is the health care provider. Although a 'health care provider' usually refers to a physician, the term includes any medical care provider, including dentists, nurses, and therapists. As illustrated in Columbia Medical Center of Las Colinas v Bush, 122 S.W. 3d 835 (Tex. 2003), \\"following orders\\" may not protect nurses and other non-physicians from liability when committing negligent acts. Relying on vicarious liability or direct corporate negligence, claims may also be brought against hospitals, clinics, managed care organizations or medical corporations for the mistakes of their employees and contractors. =Common claims= In 2013, BMJ Open performed a study in which they found that \\"failure to diagnose\\" accounted for the largest portion of medical malpractice claims brought against health professionals. Furthermore, the study found that the most common result of this negligence was death of the patient. The other most common categories of malpractice include negligent treatment and failure to warn. Thus, when a patient claims injury as the result of a medical professional's care, a malpractice case will most often be based upon one of three theories: # Failure to diagnose: a medical professional is alleged to have failed to diagnose an existing medical condition, or to have provided an incorrect diagnoses for the patient's medical condition. # Negligent treatment: a medical professional is alleged to have made a mistake that a reasonably competent professional in the same position would not have made. # Failure to warn: a medical professional is alleged to have treated the patient without first warning the patient of known risks and obtaining the patient‚Äôs informed consent to that course of treatment. =Elements of the case= A plaintiff must establish all five elements of the tort of negligence for a successful medical malpractice claim. # A duty was owed: a legal duty exists whenever a hospital or health care provider undertakes care or treatment of a patient. # A duty was breached: the provider failed to conform to the relevant standard care. # The breach caused an injury: The breach of duty was a direct cause and the proximate cause of the injury. # Deviation from the accepted standard: It must be shown that the practitioner was acting in a manner which was contrary to the generally accepted standard in his/her profession. # Further establishment of conditions of intention or malice where applicable. # Damage: Without damage (losses which may be pecuniary or emotional), there is no basis for a claim, regardless of whether the medical provider was negligent. Likewise, damage can occur without negligence, for example, when someone dies from a fatal disease. In cases involving suicide, physicians and particularly psychiatrists may be to a different standard than other defendants in a tort claim. In most tort cases, suicide is legally viewed as an act which terminates a chain of causality. Although the defendant may be held negligent for another's suicide, he or she is not responsible for damages which occur after the act. An exception is made for physicians who are found to have committed malpractice that results in a suicide, with damages assessed based on losses that are proved likely to accrue after the act of suicide.AJ Giannini, MC Giannini, AE Slaby. SuicideThe medical-legal implications. Psychiatric Forum. 14(2):6-10, 1989. =The trial= Like all other tort cases, the plaintiff or their attorney files a lawsuit in a court with appropriate jurisdiction. However, unlike other tort cases, many states require that a plaintiff take specific steps before a medical malpractice lawsuit can be filed, such as providing the defendant with advance notice of intent to sue, obtaining and filing with the court a certificate of merit from a qualified medical expert who attests to the validity of the plaintiff's cause of action, submitting the claim to a panel of legal and medical experts for evaluation, or participating in mediation in an attempt to resolve the claim without litigation. Between the filing of suit and the trial, the parties are required to share information through discovery. Such information includes interrogatories, requests for documents and deposition. If both parties agree, the case may be settled pre- trial on negotiated terms. If the parties cannot agree, the case will proceed to trial. The plaintiff has the burden of proof to prove all the elements by a preponderance of evidence. At trial, both parties will usually present experts to testify as to the standard of care required, and other technical issues. The fact-finder (judge or jury) must then weigh all the evidence and determine which side is the most credible. The fact-finder will render a verdict for the prevailing party. If the plaintiff prevails, the fact-finder will assess damages within the parameters of the judge's instructions. The verdict is then reduced to the judgment of the court. The losing party may move for a new trial. In a few jurisdictions, a plaintiff who is dissatisfied by a small judgment may move for additur. In most jurisdictions, a defendant who is dissatisfied with a large judgment may move for remittitur. Either side may take an appeal from the judgment. =Expert testimony= Expert witnesses must be qualified by the Court, based on the prospective experts qualifications and the standards set from legal precedent. To be qualified as an expert in a medical malpractice case, a person must have a sufficient knowledge, education, training, or experience regarding the specific issue before the court to qualify the expert to give a reliable opinion on a relevant issue. The qualifications of the expert are not the deciding factors as to whether the individual will be qualified, although they are certainly important considerations. Expert testimony is not qualified \\"just because somebody with a diploma says it is so\\" (United States v. Ingham, 42 M.J. 218, 226 [A.C.M.R. 1995]). In addition to appropriate qualifications of the expert, the proposed testimony must meet certain criteria for reliability. In the United States, two models for evaluating the proposed testimony are used: The more common (and some believe more reliable) approach used by all federal courts and most state courts is the 'gatekeeper' model, which is a test formulated from the US Supreme Court cases Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (509 U.S. 579 [1993]), General Electric Co. v. Joiner (522 U.S. 136 [1997]), and Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (526 U.S. 137 [1999]). Before the trial, a Daubert hearing will take place before the judge (without the jury). The trial court judge must consider evidence presented to determine whether an expert's \\"testimony rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\\" (Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597). The Daubert hearing considers 4 questions about the testimony the prospective expert proposes: * Whether a \\"theory or technique . . . can be (and has been) tested\\" * Whether it \\"has been subjected to peer review and publication\\". * Whether, in respect to a particular technique, there is a high \\"known or potential rate of error\\" * Whether there are \\"standards controlling the technique's operation\\". Some state courts still use the Frye test that relies on scientific consensus to assess the admissibility of novel scientific evidence. Daubert expressly rejected the earlier federal rule's incorporation of the Frye test. (Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-594) Expert testimony that would have passed the Frye test is now excluded under the more stringent requirements of Federal Rules of Evidence as construed by Daubert. In view of Daubert and Kuhmo, the pre trial preparation of expert witnesses is critical.Preparing Plaintiff's Expert in the Post Kuhmo Era, Anthony H. Gair, New York State Bar Association, 1999 A problem with Daubert is that the presiding judge may admit testimony which derives from highly contested data. The judge may expand the limits contained in the \\"school of thought\\" precedent. Papers that are self-published may be admiited as the basis for expert testimony. Non-peer reviewed journals may also be admitted in similar fashion. The only criterion is the opinion of a single judge who, in all likelihood, has no relevant scientific or medical training. Many states also require that a certificate of merit before a malpractice lawsuit be filed which requires a report from a medical physician that the physician accused of negligence breached the standard of care and caused injury to the patient. =Damages= The plaintiff's damages may include compensatory and, in some states and under qualifying circumstances, punitive damages. Compensatory damages are both economic and non-economic. * Economic damages include financial losses such as lost wages (sometimes called lost earning capacity), medical expenses and life care expenses. These damages may be assessed for past and future losses. * Non-economic damages are assessed for the injury itself: physical and psychological harm, such as loss of vision, loss of a limb or organ, the reduced enjoyment of life due to a disability or loss of a loved one, severe pain and emotional distress. Punitive damages are not available in all states and, when allowed, are usually only awarded in the event of wanton and reckless conduct. Statute of limitations There is only a limited time during which a medical malpractice lawsuit can be filed. In the United States, these time limits are set by statute. In civil law systems, similar provisions are usually part of the civil code or criminal code and are often known collectively as \\"periods of prescription\\" or \\"prescriptive periods.\\" The length of the time period and when that period begins vary per jurisdiction and type of malpractice. Therefore, each state has different time limits set. For example, in Pennsylvania, there is a two-year statute of limitation,See subsection (2), but in other states the limitations period may be longer. Most states have special provisions for minors that may potentially extend the statute of limitations for a minor who has been injured as the result of medical malpractice. Nature of malpractice and compensation A 2011 study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 75% of physicians in \\"low-risk\\" specialties and virtually 100% of physicians in \\"high-risk\\" specialties could expect to face a malpractice claim during their careers. However, the authors also noted that the vast majority of malpractice claims did not lead to any indemnity payments. Most (73%) settled malpractice claims involve medical error. A 2006 study concluded that claims without evidence of error \\"are not uncommon, but most [72%] are denied compensation. The vast majority of expenditures [54%] go toward litigation over errors and payment of them. The overhead costs of malpractice litigation are exorbitant.\\" Physicians examined the records of 1452 closed malpractice claims. Ninety- seven percent were associated with injury; of them, 73% got compensation. Three percent of the claims were not associated with injuries; of them, 16% got compensation. 63% were associated with errors; of them, 73% got compensation (average $521,560). Thirty-seven percent were not associated with errors; of them, 28% got compensation (average $313,205). Claims not associated with errors accounted for 13 to 16% percent of the total costs. For every dollar spent on compensation, 54 cents went to administrative expenses (including lawyers, experts, and courts). Claims involving errors accounted for 78 percent of administrative costs.Claims, Errors, and Compensation Payments in Medical Malpractice Litigation, New England Journal of Medicine, May 11, 2006.Medical Malpractice Study, Disproving Frivolous Myth, Jeffrey B.

Arguments about the medical liability system  Doctors' groups, patients, and insurance companies have criticized medical malpractice litigation as expensive, adversarial, unpredictable, and inefficient. They claim that the cost of medical malpractice litigation in the United States has steadily increased at almost 12 percent annually since 1975. Towers Perrin, Tillinghast, U.S. Tort Costs and Cross-Border Perspectives: 2005 Update, (New York, NY: Towers Perrin, March 2006).

Jury Verdict Research, a database of plaintiff and defense verdicts, says awards in medical liability cases increased 43 percent in 1999, from $700,000 to $1,000,000. However, more recent research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that median medical malpractice awards in states range from $109,000 to $195,000.Medical Malpractice Insurance Claims in Seven States U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), March 27, 2007. These critics assert that these rate increases are causing doctors to go out of business or move to states with more favorable tort systems.Medical Malpractice Insurance Roundtable: Doctors Prescribe Remedies for Crisis . The Business Journal, Jun 11, 2004, accessed August 3, 2006. Not everyone agrees, though, that medical malpractice lawsuits are solely causing these rate increases.Medical malpractice#Arguments about the medical liability system A 2003 report from the General Accounting Office found multiple reasons for these rate increases, with medical malpractice lawsuits being the primary driver.GAO-03-702 Medical Malpractice Insurance: Multiple Factors Have Contributed to Increased Premium Rates General Accounting Office, June 2003, accessed August 3, 2006. Despite noting multiple reasons for rate increases, the report goes on to state that the \\"GAO found that losses on medical malpractice claims-which make up the largest part of insurers‚Äô costs-appear to be the primary driver of rate increases in the long run.\\" More recent data has indicated that medical malpractice rates are generally no longer rising. In 2011, data pooled from the industry by the publication Medical Liability Monitor indicated that medical malpractice insurance rates had declined for four straight years. The decrease was seen in both states that had enacted tort reform and in states that had not, leading actuaries familiar with the data to suggest that patient safety and risk management campaigns had had a more significant effect.Rising Insurance Premiums? Yes and No. Medscape Medical News, October 5, 2011. The major tort reform proposals have been: # Special medical malpractice courts # Limits on noneconomic damages # Reduction in the statute of limitations of action The majority of the American public supports reforms to the malpractice system. However, surveys show that the majority of the American public also vastly underestimate the extent of medical errors.National Survey on Consumers' Experiences With Patient Safety and Quality Information Kaiser Family Foundation. Recent research has shown that while both health consumers and health producers are concerned about some of the adverse consequences of healthcare litigation, health consumers perceive that increased healthcare litigation can reduce the incentives for negligence on the part of healthcare providers.Cristina Corduneanu-Huci, Alexander Hamilton, and Issel Masses- Ferrer, The political economy of healthcare litigation: model and empirical application to Uruguay.

Several new approaches to addressing medical malpractice have been investigated. Communication and Resolution Programs: When a medical error is identified, the patient is approached by the physician and/or health care system and they mutually arrive at a settlement. Several laws have been passed to facilitate communication and resolution (Mandatory presuit notification laws, apology laws and State- facilitated dispute resolution laws). Safe Harbors for Adherence to Practice Guidelines: This approach provides a defense for physicians if they follow pre approved clinical practice guidelines. Judge-directed compensation: A group of judges with expertise in medical malpractice meet with each sides attorneys and negotiates a settlement between the parties. Administrative Compensation:Sweden and New Zealand created health courts. Claims are sent to these courts that have the authority to settle a claim. Attorneys are not required and the claims are settled based the opinions of neutral experts. Compensation is awarded based on preset schedules and are based on the degree of injury. =Limits on recovery= Many jurisdictions placed non-economic damages caps that limit the amount that victims of medical malpractice can recover from negligent physicians, purportedly in an effort to decrease hospital and physician costs. In California, for example, recovery for non- economic damages are limited to $250,000. According to the Supreme Court of California, \\"noneconomic damages compensate the plaintiff for 'pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage [as per Cal.Civ.Code section 3333.2, subdivision (a)].' Section 1431.2, subdivision (b)(2) similarly defines noneconomic damages as 'subjective, non-monetary losses including, but not limited to, pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation and humiliation.'‚ÄùRashidi v. Moser, 339 P.3d 334, n. 3 (Cal. 2014) Tort reform supporters argue that states have enacted such laws in order to keep health care costs low, in addition to helping curb medical malpractice litigation. However, according to the Supreme Court of California, the state's non- economic damages caps are \\"not a legislative attempt to estimate the true damages suffered by plaintiffs, but rather an attempt to control and reduce medical malpractice insurance costs by placing a predictable, uniform limit on the defendant's liability for noneconomic damages.\\"Salgado v. County of Los Angeles, 967 P.2d 585, 591 (Cal. 1998) Texas law creates the most difficult \\"hurdles\\" in the United States for a plaintiff to succeed in recovering damages for any medical malpractice, even for such objective cases such as an emergency room exposure to the Ebola virus disease. =Texas law and effect= Texas passed a \\"tort reform\\" law taking effect on September 1, 2003.Associated Press 10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts (September 3, 2013). The act limited non-economic damages (e.g., damages for pain and suffering) in most malpractice cases to $250,000 across all healthcare providers and $250,000 for healthcare facilities, with a limit of two facilities per claim.Steve Jacob, Studies: Texas Tort Reform Has Had No Effect on Physician Supply, Lowering Costs, Dallas/Fort Worth Healthcare Daily (August 28, 2012). As of 2013, Texas was one of 31 states to cap non-economic damages. Following 2003, medical malpractice insurance rates were reduced in Texas.Fact Sheet: The Real Story of Texas Insurance Rates, Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School (accessed October 22, 2015). However, the Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School reports that rate reductions are likely attributable not to tort laws, but because of broader trends, such as \\"political pressure, the size of prior rate hikes, and the impact of the industry's economic cycle, causing rates to drop everywhere in the country.\\" States which do not impose caps on malpractice damages, such as Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have experienced reductions or stabilization in malpractice rates as well. Various studies have shown that the Texas tort-reform law has had no effect on healthcare costs or the number of physicians practicing in the state. A February 2014 study found \\"no evidence to support\\" the claim that \\"there had been a dramatic increase in physicians moving to Texas due to the improved liability climate.\\"David A. Hyman, Charles Silver, Bernard S. Black & Myungho Paik, Does Tort Reform Affect Physician Supply? Evidence from Texas, International Review of Law and Economics, Vol. 42, pp. 203-218 (February 2014). The study found that this is true \\"for all patient care physicians in Texas, high-malpractice-risk specialties, primary care physicians, and rural physicians. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that the Texas law prevents patients from getting compensation or damages even in cases where the patient clearly deserves it. In particular, the ‚Äúwillful and wanton‚Äù negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the harm is clearly negligent but not willful.Despite Counsel, Victim Is Hindered by Tort Laws, By BECCA AARONSON, New York Times, JAN. 24, 2013 =Financial Impact= An August 2003 National Bureau of Economic Research paper by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra found that (1) \\"increases in malpractice payments made on behalf of physicians do not seem to be the driving force behind increases in premiums\\"; (2) \\"increases in malpractice costs (both premiums overall and the subcomponent factors) do not seem to affect the overall size of the physician workforce, although they may deter marginal entry, increase marginal exit, and reduce the rural physician workforce\\"; and (3) \\"there is little evidence of increased use of many treatments in response to malpractice liability at the state level, although there may be some increase in screening procedures such as mammography.\\"Katherine Baicker & Amitabh Chandra, NBER Working Paper No. 10709, The Effect of Malpractice Liability on the Delivery of Health Care (August 2004). A 1996 study by Daniel P. Kessler and Mark McClellan analyzing data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries treated for two serious cardiac diseases in 1984, 1987, and 1990 determined that \\"malpractice reforms that directly reduce provider liability pressure lead to reductions of 5 to 9 percent in medical expenditures without substantial effects on mortality or medical complications.\\"Daniel P.

A 2006 PriceWaterhouseCoopers report for America's Health Insurance Plans (a health-insurer trade association) used the 2 percent figure and an extrapolation from the Kessler and McClellan report to estimate that the combined cost of insurance and defensive medicine accounts for 10 percent of total health care costs in the U.S.PriceWaterhouseCoopers, The factors fueling rising healthcare costs 2006.

In 2009, the CBO \\"concluded that implementing a package of five malpractice reforms would reduce national health spending by about 0.5 percent.\\"Report: Responses to Questions on the Effects of Tort Reform, Congressional Budget Office (December 29, 2009). A study by Michelle M. Mello and others published in the journal Health Affairs in 2010 estimated that the total annual cost of the medical liability system, including \\"defensive medicine,\\" was about 2.4 percent of total U.S. health care spending. The authors noted that \\"this is less than some imaginative estimates put forward in the health reform debate, and it represents a small fraction of total health care spending,\\" although it was not \\"trivial\\" in absolute terms. A study by RAND Corp. researchers published in October 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that laws restricting medical-malpractice suits do not reduce the amount of \\"defensive medicine\\" or reduce health-care costs. The researchers, led by Daniel A. Waxman, examined 3.8 million Medicare patient records from hospital emergency departments from 1997 to 2011, comparing care in three states that enacted strict malpractice reform laws about a decade earlier (Georgia, Texas and South Carolina) to care in neighboring states that did not enact such laws. The study found that the laws had no effect on whether doctors ordered resource-intensive care (e.g., CT or MRI scans and hospitalization).Tougher State Malpractice Laws May Not Reduce Defensive Medicine, Insurance Journal (October 27, 2014).

It sought to monitor global ocean circulation, study the ties between the ocean and the atmosphere, improve global climate forecasts and predictions, and monitor events such as El Ni√±o and ocean eddies.. Jason-1 was launched in 2001 and it was followed by OSTM/Jason-2 in 2008, and Jason-3 in 2016  the Jason satellite series. Naming The lineage of the name begins with the JASO1 meeting (JASO = Journ√©es Altim√©triques Satellitaires pour l'Oc√©anographie) in Toulouse, France to study the problems of assimilating altimeter data in models. Jason as an acronym also stands for \\"Joint Altimetry Satellite Oceanography Network\\". Additionally it is used to reference the mythical quest for knowledge of Jason and the Argonauts. History Jason-1 is the successor to the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which measured ocean surface topography from 1992 through 2005. Like its predecessor, Jason-1 is a joint project between the NASA (United States) and CNES (France) space agencies. Jason-1's successor, the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on the Jason-2 satellite, was launched in June 2008. These satellites provide a unique global view of the oceans that is impossible to acquire using traditional ship-based sampling. Jason-1 was built by Thales Alenia Space using a Proteus platform, under a contract from CNES, as well as the main Jason-1 instrument, the Poseidon-2 altimeter (successor to the Poseidon altimeter on-board TOPEX/Poseidon) Jason-1 was designed to measure climate change through very precise millimeter-per-year measurements of global sea level changes. As did TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 uses an altimeter to measure the hills and valleys of the ocean's surface. These measurements of sea surface topography allow scientists to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents and monitor global ocean circulation. The global ocean is Earth's primary storehouse of solar energy. Jason-1's measurements of sea surface height reveal where this heat is stored, how it moves around Earth by ocean currents, and how these processes affect weather and climate. Jason-1 was launched on December 7, 2001 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta II rocket. During the first months Jason-1 shared an almost identical orbit to TOPEX/Poseidon, which allowed for cross calibration. At the end of this period, the older satellite was moved to a new orbit midway between each Jason ground track. Jason had a repeat cycle of 10 days. On 16 March 2002, Jason-1 experienced a sudden attitude upset, accompanied by temporary fluctuations in the onboard electrical systems. Soon after this incident, two new small pieces of space debris were observed in orbits slightly lower than Jason-1's, and spectroscopic analysis eventually proved them to have originated from Jason-1. In 2011, it was determined that the pieces of debris had most likely been ejected from Jason-1 by an unidentified, small \\"high-speed particle\\" hitting one of the spacecraft's solar panels. Orbit maneuvers in 2009 put the Jason-1 satellite on the opposite side of Earth from the Jason-2 satellite, which is operated by the U.S. and French weather agencies. At that time, Jason-1 flew over the same region of the ocean that Jason-2 flew over five days earlier. Its ground tracks fell midway between those of Jason-2, which are about apart at the equator. This interleaved tandem mission provided twice the number of measurements of the ocean's surface, bringing smaller features such as ocean eddies into view. The tandem mission also helped pave the way for a future ocean altimeter mission that would collect much more detailed data with its single instrument than the two Jason satellites now do together. In early 2012, having helped cross- calibrate the Jason-2 replacement mission, Jason-1 was maneuvered into its graveyard orbit and all remaining fuel was vented.\\"Last transmitter dies, finalizing retirement for ocean-sensing satellite.\\" Ars Technica. Retrieved: 25 May 2017. The mission was still able to return science data, measuring Earth's gravity field over the ocean. On 21 June 2013, contact with Jason-1 was lost; multiple attempts to re-establish communication failed. It was determined that the last remaining transmitter on board the spacecraft had failed. Operators sent commands to the satellite to turn off remaining functioning components on 1 July 2013, rendering it decommissioned. It is estimated that the spacecraft will remain on orbit for at least 1,000 years.\\"Long-Running Jason-1 Ocean Satellite Takes Final Bow.\\" Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Retrieved: 25 May 2017. The program is named after the Greek mythological hero Jason. Satellite instruments Jason-1 has five 5 instruments: * Poseidon 2 ‚Äì Nadir pointing Radar altimeter using C band and for measuring height above sea surface. * Jason Microwave Radiometer (JMR) ‚Äì measures water vapor along altimeter path to correct for pulse delay * DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) for orbit determination to within 10 cm or less and ionospheric correction data for Poseidon 2. * BlackJack Global Positioning System receiver provides precise orbit ephemeris data * Laser retroreflector array works with ground stations to track the satellite and calibrate and verify altimeter measurements. The Jason-1 satellite, its altimeter instrument and a position-tracking antenna were built in France. The radiometer, Global Positioning System receiver and laser retroreflector array were built in the United States. Use of information TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 have led to major advances in the science of physical oceanography and in climate studies. Their 15-year data record of ocean surface topography has provided the first opportunity to observe and understand the global change of ocean circulation and sea level. The results have improved the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate change and improved weather and climate predictions. Data from these missions are used to improve ocean models, forecast hurricane intensity, and identify and track large ocean/atmosphere phenomena such as El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a. The data are also used every day in applications as diverse as routing ships, improving the safety and efficiency of offshore industry operations, managing fisheries, and tracking marine mammals. TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 have made major contributions to the understanding of: =Ocean Variability= The missions revealed the surprising variability of the ocean, how much it changes from season to season, year to year, decade to decade and on even longer time scales. They ended the traditional notion of a quasi-steady, large-scale pattern of global ocean circulation by proving that the ocean is changing rapidly on all scales, from huge features such as El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a, which can cover the entire equatorial Pacific, to tiny eddies swirling off the large Gulf Stream in the Atlantic. Topex/Poseidon satellite (on the left) measured an average annual Global Mean Sea Level rise of 3.1 mm/year, Jason-1 is measuring only 2.3 mm/year GMSL rise, and the Envisat satellite (2002‚Äì2012) is measuring just 0.5 mm/year GMSL rise. In this graph, the vertical scale represents globally averaged mean sea level. Seasonal variations in sea level have been removed to show the underlying trend. Image credit: University of Colorado =Sea level change= Measurements by Jason-1 indicate that mean sea level has been rising at an average rate of 2.28 millimeters (.09 inches) per year since 2001. This is somewhat less than the rate measured by the earlier TOPEX/Poseidon mission, but over four times the rate measured by the later Envisat mission. Mean sea level measurements from Jason-1 are continuously graphed at the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales web site, on the Aviso page. A composite sea level graph, using data from several satellites, is also available on that site. The data record from these altimetry missions has given scientists important insights into how global sea level is affected by natural climate variability, as well as by human activities. =Planetary Waves= TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 made clear the importance of planetary-scale waves, such as Rossby and Kelvin waves. No one had realized how widespread these waves are. Thousands of kilometers wide, these waves are driven by wind under the influence of Earth's rotation and are important mechanisms for transmitting climate signals across the large ocean basins. At high latitudes, they travel twice as fast as scientists believed previously, showing the ocean responds much more quickly to climate changes than was known before these missions. =Ocean tides= The precise measurements of TOPEX/Poseidon's and Jason-1 have brought knowledge of ocean tides to an unprecedented level. The change of water level due to tidal motion in the deep ocean is known everywhere on the globe to within 2.5 centimeters (one inch). This new knowledge has revised notions about how tides dissipate. Instead of losing all their energy over shallow seas near the coasts, as previously believed, about one third of tidal energy is actually lost to the deep ocean. There, the energy is consumed by mixing water of different properties, a fundamental mechanism in the physics governing the general circulation of the ocean. =Ocean Models= TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 observations provided the first global data for improving the performance of the numerical ocean models that are a key component of climate prediction models. TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 data are available at the University of Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center, and the French data archive center AVISO. Benefits to society  Altimetry data have a wide variety of uses from basic scientific research on climate to ship routing. Applications include: Climate Research: Altimetry data are incorporated into computer models to understand and predict changes in the distribution of heat in the ocean, a key element of climate. El Ni√±o & La Ni√±a Forecasting: Understanding the pattern and effects of climate cycles such as El Ni√±o helps predict and mitigate the disastrous effects of floods and drought. Altimetry reveals the ocean heat that can fuel hurricanes. Hurricane Forecasting: Altimeter data and satellite ocean wind data are incorporated into atmospheric models for hurricane season forecasting and individual storm severity. Ship Routing: Maps of ocean currents, eddies, and vector winds are used in commercial shipping and recreational yachting to optimize routes. Offshore Industries: Cable-laying vessels and offshore oil operations require accurate knowledge of ocean circulation patterns to minimize impacts from strong currents. Marine Mammal Research: Sperm whales, fur seals, and other marine mammals can be tracked, and therefore studied, around ocean eddies where nutrients and plankton are abundant. Fisheries Management: Satellite data identify ocean eddies which bring an increase in organisms that comprise the marine food web, attracting fish and fishermen. Coral Reef Research: Remotely sensed data are used to monitor and assess coral reef ecosystems, which are sensitive to changes in ocean temperature. Marine Debris Tracking: The amount of floating and partially submerged material, including nets, timber and ship debris, is increasing with human population. Altimetry can help locate these hazardous materials.

In 1968 she was moved to a training role. =Portuguese-Indian War= On 18 December 1961, during the annexation of the Portuguese State of India, also known as \\"Operation Vijay\\" or the Portuguese-Indian War, in which the state of Goa and its dependencies of Daman and Diu were annexed, Delhi was tasked to patrol the waters off Diu. At dawn, the ship was spotted by the Portuguese defenders, but they did not recognize its hoisted battle flag. The Portuguese land based artillery did not open fire considering it might be a cargo vessel. Indian Navy reports state that Delhi supported the Indian Army's advance by firing on the citadel, and neutralizing the airport control tower. The detailed Portuguese reports on the invasion do not mention fire from the main guns of the Indian cruiser, though a possible cause of the discrepancy is that the source of the fire from the ageing cruiser may not have been identified, due to the Indian Army firing from the landward side. Alternatively, the cruiser's shells may have fallen short of the citadel. NRP Afonso de Albuquerque was sunk in action off Goa on 18 Dec 1961. The only documented event of naval action between India and Portugal in Portuguese reports in the Diu region, was the sinking of the Portuguese patrol boat NRP Vega by Indian Air Force aircraft, after Vega opened fire on them with its sole Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. After the sinking of Vega the crew was taken prisoner-of-war on the shore. =Visit to New Zealand= In 1969, Delhi visited New Zealand under Vice Admiral Barbosa. The visit was the occasion of many reunions of Achilles veterans who were plied with large quantities of rum and beer, and taken on a quick trip by the ship. =Decommissioning= Delhi was decommissioned at Bombay in 1978. Subsequently, one of her gun turrets was sent to New Zealand, where it is preserved. A second turret, or gun, is reported to be preserved at the Regiment of Artillery Museum Nashik. The precise fate of the third turret is unknown, but a persistent rumour holds that it was officially recorded as \\"eaten by white ants\\". The remainder of the ship was scrapped. The main mast serves as the quarterdeck through which cadets from the National Defence Academy of India pass out. References Publications * Campbell, John (1985). Naval Weapons of World War Two.

It travels from its source in the centre of the county to the county seat Belleville to the Bay of Quinte. Name Originally named the Sagonaska River by the indigenous peoples of the area, the river was renamed in 1807 by the British colonial government (Upper Canada) after Francis Rawdon-Hastings, Earl of Moira. Rawdon-Hastings fought in the American Revolutionary War and had a political career in England, but has no connection with the site. The name Sagonaska continues to be used in the Belleville area, as the name of a bridge over the Moira, and the name of a public school. Course The Moira River begins at Jordan Lake just south of the settlement of Gunter in the more southerly Tudor portion of the township of Tudor and Cashel at an elevation of . It flows south and then southeast into the township of Madoc, passes through Wolf Lake at an elevation of , is crossed by Highway 62, and takes in the right tributary Jordan River at the settlement of Bannockburn, before heading south. The river loops east then back west under the highway at Keller Bridge and continues south to the west of Eldorado. The river takes a sharp turn west, before taking in the right tributary Gawley Creek and heading south again at Malone in the municipality of Marmora and Lake. It passes through Deloro Lake and over the Deloro Dam at Deloro at an elevation of , and is crossed by Highway 7. The Moira then heads east, enters the township of Stirling-Rawdon, and empties into Bend Bay on Moira Lake at an elevation of , south of the community of Madoc, where it takes in the left tributary Madoc Creek. The river continues east from the lake, enters the municipality of Tweed and takes in the left tributaries Black River and Skootamatta River. It then heads south through the village of Tweed, Ontario into Stoco Lake at an elevation of , where it takes in the left tributaries Sulphide Creek and Clare River. The river leaves the lake via two channels, an eastern channel Moira River and the named West Channel, which enclose Sugar Island. It heads southwest, and is paralleled by Highway 37 from Tweed all the way to Belleville. The river flows through the northwest corner of the township of Tyendinaga and enters the city of Belleville, continuing southeast. It takes in the right tributaries Chrysal Creek and Palliser Creek, flows over the Belleville Yardmen Dam through the former Laziers Dam Site, the McLeod Dam and the Lott Dam and reaches its mouth at the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario. Watershed While the Moira river itself is entirely within Hastings County, the watershed includes parts of the next two counties to the east, Lennox and Addington (one east) and Frontenac (two east). Tributaries of the Clare River extend into the township of Central Frontenac in Frontenac County. The Clare River also is in the townships of Stone Mills and Addington Highlands in Lennox and Addington County. The Skootamatta River and tributitaries flow through Addington Highlands as well. The tributaries also extend further north in Hastings County than the Moira itself. For example, Partridge Creek in the Skootamatta system extends past Upper Partridge Lake to 44¬∞ 57‚Ä≤ 28‚Ä≥ North in the more northerly Cashel portion of the township of Tudor and Cashel.

He currently resides in the United States, where he was granted political asylum. Biography Akhmadov was born on December 19, 1960 in Kazakhstan, where most of the Chechen nation‚Äîincluding his family‚Äîhad been exiled by Stalin's government in 1944. The Akhmadovs returned to Chechnya in 1962. From 1978 to 1981 Ilyas Akhmadov studied in the Polytechnic University of Volgograd. After graduation, he served for four years as a Sergeant Major in the Red Army's Strategic Missile Forces. He left the army in 1985 as a Third Lieutenant, and in 1991 he graduated with distinction in political science from the Rostov University. Returning to Chechnya, which had declared independence from Russia in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, he took a job in the political department of the Chechen Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August 1994 Akhmadov was wounded during the fighting with forces of the warlord Ruslan Labazanov in Argun. After the First Chechen War broke in 1994, Akhmadov fought against the Russian federal forces, serving first as a volunteer fighter and then as the public affairs officer to Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen headquarters' chief of staff. In 1996 he retired to private life. =Exile= On July 29, 1999, a month before the beginning of the Second Chechen War, the President of Ichkeria Aslan Maskhadov appointed Ilyas Akhmadov as Foreign Minister. Soon, Akhmadov and his colleagues in the separatist government dispersed and went into hiding, with some again taking up arms against the Russians. Akhmadov himself left Chechnya. In his appeals and meetings with the representatives of UN, OSCE, PACE, European Parliament, UNHCR, U.S. Congress, the U.S. presidential administration and international NGOs, he called for observance of human rights during the conflict. In January 2000, Akhmadov visited the United States, where he met with officials of the State Department. He embarked on a tour of Western capitals, returning twice to the United States in 2000 and again in 2001. This provoked complaints from Russia, which alleged that he was involved in terrorism in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia. In 2002 Akhmadov claimed asylum in the United States but his initial bid was turned down after opposition from the United States Department of Homeland Security. However, he gained support from members of the U.S. Congress and peace campaigners, who saw him as a moderate (indeed, Akhmadov has repeatedly criticised suicide bombings and hostage-takings by Chechen extremists and has campaigned for peace talks to end the war). In April 2004 an Immigration Judge in Boston issued an order granting Akhmadov asylum in the United States; that ruling became effective in August 2004 following the U.S. Government's abrupt withdrawal of its notice of appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision.

Her extant corpus of writing can be found in The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill.See Early life and first marriage Harriet Hardy was born in 1807 in Walworth, south London, to parents Harriet and Thomas Hardy, a surgeon.\\"Introduction.\\" The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs and Paula Harms Payne, Indiana University Press, 1998. Harriet was educated at home and expressed an early interest in writing poetry. She married her first husband, John Taylor, in 1826 at age 18. Together, they had three children: Herbert, Algernon, and Helen Taylor. In 1831 Harriet met John Stuart Mill. Their meeting was planned by the leader of Harriet's Unitarian Congregation. John Taylor invited Mill to dinner because of his wife's mutual interest in women's rights.Jo Ellen Jacobs, 'Chronology', The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, p.xlii Taylor was already not only writing poetry, but was interested in social reform, and had written a lengthy Life of William Caxton (which is more of a comprehensive history of the printed and written word) for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Around the time she met Mill, she was, or began, also writing a series of unpublished pieces on women's rights, ethics, toleration and marriage.\\"Chronology\\" The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs, Indiana University Press, 1998 Her friendship with Mill quickly blossomed. Taylor was attracted to Mill, who treated her as an intellectual equal. Around eighteen months later, something made Taylor break off their friendship,Jo Ellen Jacobs, 'Chronology', p.xlii causing Mill to write her a passionate love letter in French (the only piece of correspondence we have from either for this period of their relationship) in which he refuses to accept her 'eternal adieu', and, although saying 'her wish is his command', insists 'her path and mine are separated, she says; but they can, they must, meet again'.Mill, Early Correspondence, CWXII, p.114. 'Sa route et la mienne sont s6par6es, elle l'a dit: mais elles peuvent, elles doivent, se rencontrer' Evidently, she agreed, for they were soon closer than ever, exchanging a pair of lengthy essays, On Marriage, in 1833.The date is not certain. Watermarks date to 1831 and 1832. However, Taylor quotes a poem by Tennyson (\\"Eleanore\\") which was only published in 1833. In these essays, Taylor and Mill discuss the ethical questions of marriage, separation and divorce. Taylor insists that what needs to be done to 'rais[e] the condition of women' is 'to remove all interference with affection, or with anything which is, or which even might be supposed to be, demonstrative of affection'.Harriet Taylor, 'On Marriage', Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, p. 21 She criticises the fact that 'women are educated for one single object, to gain their living by marrying'; that 'to be married is the object of their existence'; and 'that object being gained they do really cease to exist as to anything worth calling life or any useful purpose'.Taylor, 'On Marriage', p. 22 She also criticises the hypocrisy and unfairness of the fact that any girl who is seen as 'suitable' for marriage is ‚Äì because only virgins are seen as suitable ‚Äì by that very fact completely ignorant as to what marriage entails.Taylor, 'On Marriage', p. 23 She argues for rights to divorce, asking 'who would wish to have the person without the inclination?'. Going against the prevailing view that she was rather anti-sex, Taylor says that though 'certain it is that there is equality in nothing now ‚Äì all the pleasure...being men's, and all the disagreeables and pains being women's', it is equally certain that 'pleasure would be infinitely heightened both in kind and degree by the perfect equality of the sexes'. She adds, 'Sex in its true and finest meaning, seems to be the way in which is manifested all that is highest, best and beautiful in the nature of human beings ‚Äì none but poets have approached to the perception of the beauty of the material world ‚Äì still less of the spiritual ‚Äì and there never yet existed a poet except by the inspiration of that feeling which is the perception of beauty in all forms and by all means which are given us, as well as by sight'. She ends the essay by saying 'It is for you' (i.e. Mill) 'the most worthy apostle of all the loftiest virtues ‚Äì to teach such as may be taught, that the higher the kind of enjoyment, the greater the degree',Taylor, 'On Marriage', p. 24 and it is noteworthy that Mill is known, in his much-later essay Utilitarianism, for introducing the concept of differences in the quality of pleasures to a previously quantitative 'hedonic calculus' inherited from Jeremy Bentham. In late September, or early October, 1833, Taylor's husband agreed to a trial separation. She went to Paris where, after what appears to have been an initial onset of cold feet regarding the possible repercussions of such a move for his, and her, reputation, Mill joined her.See Mill's letters to Thomas Carlyle, and Taylor's letters to him. Mill, CW XII, pp. 180‚Äì185. The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill. pp. 53‚Äì54. Despite evidently being extremely happy there with Mill, Taylor was conscience-stricken regarding her husband, keenly feeling the pain, and possible public humiliation, she was putting him through. Eventually, she decided to return to London, and her husband, yet by the summer of 1834 Harriet was living in her own house in Keston Heath.The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs, Indiana University Press, 2002, p 61 Mill visited Harriet frequently at her house in Keston Heath and travelled with her and sometimes her children throughout the next two decades. Marriage to Mill After John Taylor died in 1849, Taylor and Mill waited two years before marrying in 1851. Taylor was hesitant to create greater scandal than the pair already had. Mill's marriage proposal reflected his model of equality.\\"Being about, if I am so happy as to obtain her consent, to enter into the marriage relation with the only woman I have ever known, with whom I would have entered into that state; & the whole character of the marriage relation as constituted by law being such as both she and I entirely & conscientiously disapprove, for this amongst other reasons, that it confers upon one of the parties to the contract, legal power & control over the person, property, & freedom of action of the other party, independent of her own wishes and will; I, having no means of legally divesting myself of these odious powers (as I most assuredly would do if an engagement to that effect could be made legally binding on me) feel it my duty to put on record a formal protest against the existing law of marriage, in so far as conferring such powers; and a solemn promise never in any case or under any circumstances to use them. And in the event of marriage between Mrs. Taylor and me I declare it to be my will and intention, & the condition of the engagement between us, that she retains in all respects whatever the same absolute freedom of action, & freedom of disposal of herself and of all that does or may at any time belong to her, as if no such marriage had taken place; and I absolutely disclaim & repudiate all pretension to have acquired any rights whatever by virtue of such marriage. 6th March 1851 J.S.Mill\\",The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 166‚Äì167. She wrote a number of essays, including several joint-authored pieces with Mill on domestic violenceThe Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill Chapter 4. and The Enfranchisement of Women, published in 1851.The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill. pp. 51‚Äì73. Own work Harriet began publishing her works when she was pregnant with her third child, Helen. She provided a variety of literature for the Unitarian journal Monthly Repository and \\"Enfranchisement of Women\\". Though she made many contributions over the years, little of her own work was published under her own name during her lifetime. She was the co-author of several newspaper articles on domestic violence published anonymously in the Morning Chronicle, Daily News, and Sunday Times in the 1840s.The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 75‚Äì131. She read and commented on all the material produced by John Stuart Mill. In his autobiography, Mill claimed Harriet as the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He added, \\"when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen.\\" The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill Few of Mill's friends were permitted to meet her. Thomas and Jane Carlyle, who were allowed to make her acquaintance, did not form a favourable opinion of her abilities. Thomas Carlyle described her as ‚Äúfull of unwise intellect, asking and re-asking stupid questions‚Äù, while Jane considered her ‚ÄúA peculiarly affected and empty body\\". https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/05/romance-socialism-j-s-mill/ A letter written by Mill in 1854 suggests the attribution of credit goes both ways for her and John Stuart Mill; \\"I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is to come, to have our two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours\\". There is speculation that this indicates some reluctance on her part, potentially in response to a philosophical text published by Mill only or as a coauthored work, but this evidence as well as John Stuart Mill's comments on collaboration in his autobiography indicates the two worked as a pair for much of their work. Mill, John Stuart. Autobiography. Henry Holt and Co. J. S. Mill called her a valuable contributor to much of his work, especially On Liberty, which he later dedicated to her when it was published in 1859, a year after her death. She also contributed to Principles of Political Economy.The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 195‚Äì251 Death Harriet Taylor Mill died in the Hotel d'Europe in Avignon, France, on 3 November 1858, after developing severe lung congestion.

Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. In the Domesday Book, the name is given as Malgun, meaning \\"settlement by the gravelly places\\". In 2001 the parish had a population of approximately 150. Malham parish increased in size geographically (to include Malham Moor) and so at the 2011 Census had a population of 238. Malham lies at the upper end of the valley of the River Aire, known above Airton as Malhamdale, in the Yorkshire Dales. The surrounding countryside is well known for its limestone pavements and other examples of limestone scenery. Tourist attractions include Malham Tarn, Malham Cove, Gordale Scar, Janet's Foss and the Dry Valley. In the 1950s the village gave its name to a Ham class minesweeper, HMS Malham. Governance Malham has a joint parish council, Kirkby Malhamdale Parish Council, with the parishes of Malham Moor, Kirkby Malham and Hanlith. Tourism Malham is a popular walkers' destination. The rise in tourism over Malham's history has led to some deterioration of the area's surrounding paths as tourists wander off the paths and cause pockets of erosion, a process often called \\"footpath erosion\\". The footpaths in the area are maintained by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority. In the village there is a National Park Information Centre and a large car park. The Pennine Way long distance path passes through the village. Nearby natural landmarks include Malham Cove, Malham Tarn, Gordale Scar and Janet's Foss. The Malham Show Fell Race course runs over the nearby Cawden. In May 2006, it was reported that a covert listening device was discovered hidden in the local parish hall, leaving the villagers baffled. The electronic transmitter was found in a wall socket during a safety inspection at Malham village hall. Part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 was filmed around the Malham Cove limestone pavement. Climate Malham has an Oceanic climate, but is generally colder and wetter than most settlements in Britain. It has a relatively low altitude of around 200 metres, but is partly surrounded by fells. This exposed position means the temperature range is limited, due to little pooling of cold air. Extremes of temperature (since 1960) range from during August 1990, down to during March 2001. Village events The village hosts an annual agricultural and horticultural show on the Saturday before the August Bank Holiday. Known as the Malham Show, it has competitions for everything from Lego models to fell running. Another major annual event is the Malham Safari, when the villagers and particularly the local school build sculptures around the village. This event attracts many tourists and stalls are put up on the green. Places of worship Malham Methodist Church is located in Chapel Gate and is part of the Skipton and Grassington Circuit of the Methodist Church. St Helen‚Äôs Chapel was an ancient religious foundation mentioned in monastic charters from the twelfth century. It was demolished during the reformation. Archaeological digs at the site have been supported by the Ingleborough Archaeology Group.

Within the context of a building or bridge, a standpipe serves the same purpose as a fire hydrant. In many other countries, hydrants in streets are below ground level. Fire trucks carry standpipes and key, and there are bars on the truck. The bar is used to lift a cover in the road, exposing the hydrant. The standpipe is then \\"sunk\\" into the hydrant, and the hose is connected to the exposed ends of the standpipe. The bar is then combined with the key, and is used to turn the hydrant on and off. Antique wet standpipe preserved at Edison and Ford Winter Estates Dry standpipe A labeled dry standpipe in a university building. When standpipes are fixed into buildings, the pipe is in place permanently with an intake usually located near a road or driveway, so that a fire engine can supply water to the system. The standpipe extends into the building to supply fire fighting water to the interior of the structure via hose outlets, often located between each pair of floors in stairwells in high rise buildings. Dry standpipes are not filled with water until needed in fire fighting. Fire fighters often bring hoses in with them and attach them to standpipe outlets located along the pipe throughout the structure. This type of standpipe may also be installed horizontally on bridges. Wet standpipe A \\"wet\\" standpipe is filled with water and is pressurized at all times. In contrast to dry standpipes, which can be used only by firefighters, wet standpipes can be used by building occupants. Wet standpipes generally already come with hoses so that building occupants may fight fires quickly. This type of standpipe may also be installed horizontally on bridges. Advantages Laying a firehose up a stairwell takes time, and this time is saved by having fixed hose outlets already in place. There is also a tendency for heavy wet hoses to slide downward when placed on an incline (such as the incline seen in a stairwell), whereas standpipes do not move. The use of standpipes keeps stairwells clear and is safer for exiting occupants. Standpipes go in a direct up and down direction rather than looping around the stairwell, greatly reducing the length and thus the loss of water pressure due to friction loss. Additionally, standpipes are rigid and do not kink, which can occur when a firehose is improperly laid on a stairwell. Standpipe systems also provide a level of redundancy, should the main water distribution system within a building fail or be otherwise be compromised by a fire or explosion. Disadvantages Standpipe equipped with pressure gauge in the stairwell of a Texas hotel.Standpipes are not fail-safe systems and there have been many instances where fire operations have been compromised by standpipe systems that are damaged or otherwise not working properly.https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/fire/pdfs/face200737.pdf Firefighters must take precautions to flush the standpipe before use to clear out debris and ensure that water is available.https://firenotes.ca/2015-02-25_Flushing_the_Standpipe See also *Fire Equipment Manufacturers' Association *Fire sprinkler *Dry riser *Siamese connection References #Essentials of Fire Fighting, Fourth Edition, copyright 1998 by the Board of Regents, Oklahoma State University Firefighting equipment Fire suppression Piping ","title":"Standpipe (firefighting)"},{"id":"965610","title":"Tim Russ"},{"id":"965611","text":"Zeitz is a town in the Burgenlandkreis district, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is situated on the river White Elster, in the triangle of the federal states Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Saxony. History Zeitz was first recorded under the name Cici in the synode of Ravenna in 967. Between 965 and 982, it was the chief fortress of the March of Zeitz. Zeitz was a bishop's residence between 968 and 1028, when it was moved to Naumburg. Beginning at the end of the 13th century, the bishops again resided in their castle at Zeitz. The Herrmannsschacht (built in 1889) is one of the oldest brick factories in the world. The city was captured by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War and was given to Electorate of Saxony in 1644. It was centre of Saxe-Zeitz between 1657 and 1718 before returning to Electorate (Became Kingdom of Saxony in 1806). In 1815, it was given to Kingdom of Prussia and became district (kreis) centre in Merseburg region (regierungsbezirk) of Province of Saxony till 1944, when it became part of Halle region. It became a county free city between 1901 and 1950. It was occupied by USA troops on 27 April 1945 and was given to Soviet ones on 1 July 1945. It was a district centre in Halle region of Saxony-Anhalt state between 1945 and 1952 and again 1990 and 1994 and in Halle bezirk between 1952 and 1990. It lost status centre of county and became part of Burgenlandkreis on 1 July 1994. A bombing target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, the Brabag plant northeast of Zeitz used lignite coal to synthesize ersatz oil ‚Äì forced labor was provided by the nearby Wille subcamp of Buchenwald in Rehmsdorf and Gleina.. In the middle of the 1960s work started on the \\"Zeitz-Ost\\" residential area, and in the mid-1980s, housing estates such as the \\"V√∂lkerfreundschaft\\" () were built. On 18 August 1976, the Protestant clergyman Oskar Br√ºsewitz from Rippicha burnt himself to death in front of the Michaeliskirche. This was a protest against the DDR system. The town was an industrial centre until German Reunification made many companies in eastern Germany uncompetitive, and 20,000 people lost jobs or moved to other employment. The town still has a large sugar factory, and the nearby lignite mines (Profen and Schleenhain) and Lippendorf Power Station, together employing 2,000 people from Zeitz. Main sights Zeitz sights are predominantly situated along the Romanesque Road (point 52). * Schloss Moritzburg, a baroque-style castle with the cathedral of St. Peter and Paul.

It contains two waterfalls and has overhanging limestone cliffs over high. The gorge could have been formed by water from melting glaciers or a cavern collapse. The stream flowing through the scar is Gordale Beck, which on leaving the gorge flows over Janet's Foss before joining Malham Beck downstream to form the River Aire. A right of way leads up the gorge, but requires climbing approximately of tufa at the lower waterfall. Notable visitors William Wordsworth wrote in the sonnet Gordale, \\"let thy feet repair to Gordale chasm, terrific as the lair where the young lions couch\\". James Ward created a large and imaginative painting of it that can be seen in Tate Britain. J. M. W. Turner also painted a picture of it in 1816, also to be seen in Tate Britain. The waterfall was used as an exterior filming location in the 1982 film The Dark Crystal.

The first venue opened in 1855 on Emmet Place (then known as Nelson's Place) to the rear of the Crawford Art Gallery. This original building was destroyed by fire in 1955, and a replacement opened in 1965. With a number of additions in the early 21st century, the 1000-seat venue hosted over 100 theatre, music, opera, and comedy events in 2015. History =Original building (1855-1955)= Cork Opera House as pictured in the late 19th century Cork's opera house was originally built in the 1850s to designs by architect John Benson. Intended for the \\"promotion of science, literature and the fine arts, and the diffusion of architectural knowledge\\", the building was based on a template that the architect had used for the exhibition buildings at the Irish Industrial Exhibition. Opened in 1855, this building was originally called \\"The Athenaeum\\", and was renamed \\"The Munster Hall\\" in 1875. It was renamed as the \\"Opera House\\", after extensive reconstruction, in 1877. While this building survived the Burning of Cork by British forces in 1920, it was burned down several decades later in its centenary year of 1955. The fire started on the evening of 12 December 1955, caused by an electrical fault and fueled by wooden materials. =Redevelopment (1963-present)= The site remained undeveloped for several years, until the remains of the old building were bulldozed in early 1963 and development on a new theatre commenced. The newly constructed Opera House opened on the same site in 1965. This 1960s building was designed by Scott Tallon Walker, and was officially opened by then President of Ireland, √âamon de Valera, in October 1965. In 2000, large scale renovation works were completed on both the facade of the building and the surrounding Emmett Place. Subsequent works include the development of a new caf√©, updated acoustics and seating. Operation The Opera House has always hosted performances other than opera, with theatre, music, drama, dance, comedy and other performance types making-up the venue's repertoire. In 2015, the Opera House hosted 276 performances of 108 events in the main 1000-seat auditorium. The Half Moon Theatre, a smaller 100-seat venue which lies to the rear of the Opera House, hosted 77 performances of 29 events in the same period.

The university's beginnings date back to the founding of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (PITA) in 1916. Beginning with evening and Saturday classes, day classes were offered starting in 1926 with Lars Haukaness appointed as the first Head of the Art Department. In 1960, PITA was renamed the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) and the Art Department was renamed the Alberta College of Art (ACA). In 1973, after eight years of planning and construction, the Alberta College of Art moved into a brand new purpose-built building designed by architectural firm Cohos, Delesalle and Evamy, on the edge of Calgary's North Hill, next to the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium. The Alberta College of Art gained autonomy from SAIT in 1985, and in 1995 amended its name to become the Alberta College of Art and Design.ACAD History On February 1, 2019, ACAD officially became the Alberta University of the Arts. Academics As a college, the institution had the authority to grant certificates and diplomas. In 1995 the Alberta Government authorized granting the degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts and in 2000 gave authority to grant the Bachelor of Design degree. The Master of Fine Arts in Craft Media was launched in 2015 with the inaugural class receiving their degrees in May 2017. In March 2018, ACAD was named a university by the Minister of Advanced Education. It is the only institution in the province to offer and confer university-level undergraduate and now, graduate degree programs in art, craft, and design. On January 17, 2019, the Government of Alberta announced that ACAD was to become the Alberta University of the Arts (abbreviated as AUArts). The transition began on the same day while the name and university status became effective formally on February 1, 2019. AUArts' degree programs are housed within four administrative schools: * The School of Craft + Emerging Media (ceramics, fibre, glass, jewellery + metals, and media arts) * The School of Visual Arts (drawing, painting, print media, photography, and sculpture) * The School of Communication Design * The School of Critical + Creative Studies (non-studio academic courses) Library and galleries AUArts' Luke Lindoe Library is named after alumnus, instructor, and founder of the Ceramics Department Luke Lindoe, and maintains a collection of over 25,000 art and design-related titles. The university is also home to two professional galleries, the Illingworth Kerr Gallery (IKG) and the Marion Nicoll Gallery (MNG), and nine student-run gallery and pop-up spaces. The Alberta University of the Arts gallery was renamed after artist and teacher Illingworth Kerr when AUArts moved into its new home (current location) in 1973, expanding into a 9,500 square-foot facility. The MNG, named after artist and teacher Marion Nicoll, is based on a not-for-profit model and run by the AUArts Students' Association. MNG manages three locations (in AUArts' Main Mall, the ACAD/Jubilee LRT station hallway, and in downtown Calgary's Arts Commons +15 walkway), and focuses on exhibiting student work. AUArtSA also manages nine student exhibition spaces on campus.  Lodgepole Center  Given its name by AUArts' Elder Council to reflect the supportive nature of the lodgepole, traditionally placed at the centre of the tipi to carry the weight of the covering, AUArts' indigenous resource centre, the Lodgepole Center, officially opened on campus in September 2016. An all-inclusive space, the Lodgepole Center facilitates Elder advising and support, traditional ceremonies, and workshops, and is a quiet study, smudge, and gathering space.

It was the highest authority of the Polish Secret State in occupied Poland. It was headed by the Government Delegate for Poland, a de facto deputy Polish Prime Minister.Delegatura RzƒÖdu na Kraj at Encyklopedia WIEM The Government Delegation for Poland was intended as the first provisional government of wartorn Poland until the Exiled Polish Government could safely return from abroad to a liberated Poland. History Initially there were two Delegations formed, one for the Polish areas annexed by Germany, and one for the General Government. A delegate for the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union was never appointed. From 1942, power was consolidated and there was only one delegate chosen, in the rank of deputy prime minister. He in turn had 6 deputies for each of the regions, whose responsibilities were further delegated to county-level officers. In July 1944 the delegate's three deputies were promoted to ministers, and a Home Council of Ministers (Krajowa Rada Ministr√≥w) was created. The Home Council became the local counterpart of the Polish Government in Exile. The Delegation's political body was the Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy), a council comprising 4 main political parties. On 21 March 1943 it was renamed the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna) and became an underground coalition parliament, comprising members of the Polish Socialist Party, National Party, People's Party and Labor Party. It became the controlling body of the Delegation and the Headquarters of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa). On 9 January 1944 it was turned into a Council of National Unity (Rada Jedno≈õci Narodowej), the parliament of underground Poland. During Operation Tempest, in 1944, the Council's local representatives and local Home Army commanders, as the representatives of the legitimate Polish government and the Polish Army, emerged from underground and welcomed the advancing Red Army. Despite several instances of successful cooperation with the Soviet Union, most of the Polish representatives and commanders were soon arrested by the NKVD and sent to Russian prisons or to the Gulag. During the Warsaw Uprising, the central Government Delegation for Poland likewise came out of hiding and began acting officially as the Polish parliament in the liberated areas of Poland. After the Uprising's suppression, most of the Delegation's members left Warsaw with the civilian population and managed to evade the Germans. However, contact with local branches in Soviet- and German- occupied areas was broken. In February 1945, the Government Delegation including most members of the Council of National Unity and the Home Army Commander-in-Chief, were invited by Soviet General Ivan Serov to a conference on their eventual inclusion in the Soviet-backed Provisional Government. They were promised safe conduct beforehand but immediately arrested by the NKVD, and brought to Moscow, where they were brutally tortured for several months and tried in a staged Trial of the Sixteen. All perished.The Moscow Trial of the 16 Polish Leaders , Liberty Publications, London, 1945, 24 pages with 2 ill. Meanwhile, in Poland, the Delegation was reconstructed and continued in its duties until finally disbanded on 1 July 1945. Departments The Delegation's activities encompassed all areas of organized society. It comprised 12 branches, roughly corresponding to the ministries of the Polish government-in-exile in London. #Internal Affairs #* Security of the Delegation #* Provisional Administration - shadow administration to take over the administrational duties after liberation or during an all-national uprising #* Pa≈Ñstwowy Korpus Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa -underground police #* Council to Aid the Jews #* preparing reports on the situation in occupied Poland # Information and Press #* providing the society with news from abroad #* propaganda #* printing Rzeczpospolita, the official organ of the Office # Labour and Social Affairs #* cooperation with Polish Red Cross and Central Welfare Council # Education and Culture #* Organisation of the Underground schools and universities # Industry and Trade # Agriculture # Justice # Liquidation of the Effects of the War # Public Works and Reconstruction # Treasury # Post Offices and Telegraphs # Communications Near the end of the war, Departments of Foreign Affairs and of War Matters were created, but they have not played any significant role. Other notable units and bureaus included: * Bureau of the Newly Acquired Lands (Polish Biuro Ziem Nowych)  Established 1942. The Bureau's main task was to document the Polish claims on German lands east of the Oder river and the area of Prussia as well as planning of their post-war development. Despite the Allies agreement to grant Poland with the lands east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, the plans of the bureau were never fulfilled since most of its workers were arrested by the NKVD and sent to Gulags across Russia (see, however, Recovered Territories). * Kierownictwo Walki Cywilnej (Directorate of Civil Resistance) (since 1941) With regard to territorial structure, there were: * in General Government:  Regional Delegation for Kielce  Regional Delegation for Krak√≥w  Regional Delegation for Lublin  Regional Delegation for Warsaw- City  Regional Delegation for Warsaw-voivodeship * in the Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany:  Regional Delegation for Ciechan√≥w  Regional Delegation for ≈Å√≥d≈∫  Regional Delegation for Pomorze (Pomerania) in Toru≈Ñ  Regional Delegation for Pozna≈Ñ  Regional Delegation for ≈ölƒÖsk (Silesia) in Katowice * in the Polish territories annexed by the Soviet Union:  Regional Delegation for Bia≈Çystok  Regional Delegation for Lw√≥w (Lviv)  Regional Delegation for Nowogr√≥dek (Navahrudak)  Regional Delegation for Polesie  Regional Delegation for Wilno (Vilnius)  Regional Delegation for Wo≈Çy≈Ñ (Volhynia) See also *World War II *Participants in World War II *List of Government Delegates for Poland *Armed Forces Delegation for Poland References  *Grzegorz Ostasz, The Polish Government-in-Exile's Home Delegature Poland in World War II Polish Underground State ","title":"Government Delegation for Poland"},{"id":"965635","text":"Mahadeva Subramania Mani (; 2 March 1908 in Tanjore, Tamil Nadu - 8 January 2003 in Bangalore) was an Indian entomologist especially famous for his studies on high altitude entomology. Early life and career Early school records and University of Madras, MA Degree certificate show his name as M. Subramanya. Later on, sometime early during his service career, he recorded his name as Mahadev Subra Mani a.k.a. Mahadeva Subra Mani a.k.a. M. S. Mani. He had his early education at K. S. High School, Tanjore and passed his SSLC Examination in 1926. He then attended the Government College, Coimbatore and passed the Intermediate Examination, 1928. Later he went to medical studies just for one year 1929, at Madras Medical College and had to suspend further medical education due to financial constraints. He obtained in 1937, an M.A. degree, awarded by the University of Madras, on the basis of the Research Papers in Entomology, and finally, on the strength of his extensive scientific research, he was awarded by Agra University, D.Sc. in 1947, a degree of a Doctor of Science. The Chancellor was the late Ms. Sarojini Naidu, the then Governor of United Provinces, (Uttar Pradesh). On 15 January 1933 he migrated to Calcutta to seek employment and build his career.

He later on (1937) joined as a Research Assistant to Imperial Entomologist, Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, Delhi, and a position from which he resigned in 1944. He worked with Dr. Hem Singh Pruthi at Pusa, and Dr. Birbal Sahni, then at Lucknow, who recognising the pioneering work in scientific research, strongly proposed M. S. Mani's Membership to the Royal Society, England. He was denied promotion while his ‚Äòjunior‚Äô was promoted and hence he chose to seek his future elsewhere and resigned. He remained unemployed for sometime; he earned a living by working as an interpreter and German Language translator, during World War II, in the Censor Section of the Army H.Q., New Delhi, translating for the British Indian Army, 'official ' documents captured from the Germans. He would monitor radio broadcasts from Berlin and provide English transcripts. He also translated German language technical journals and scientific reports. As a matter of fact, he provided the English version of the German technology, for manufacturing hydrogenated oil ['Vanaspati'] in India to the founder of the manufacturing plant at Modinagar. He left Delhi and joined as a lecturer in 1945, the teaching faculty of the Department of Zoology, St. John's College, Agra; during his long stint at St. John's College, he pioneered and established the School of Entomology in 1950, established a benchmark scientific excellence, where he became the Professor of Zoology and Entomology and appointed as the Head of the Department for Zoology, succeeding Prof. Lalit Prasad Mathur, who took over as the Registrar, Agra University. In recognition of his scientific output, both in quality and quantity, he was honoured by the University of Agra and awarded a D.Sc. degree, Doctor of Science. He pioneered fundamental research in entomology and received support from the highest levels and the University Grants Commission, eminent persons like Dr. Radhakrishnan, Zakir Hussein, etc., and established the School of Entomology in 1950, in the Campus of St. John's College, Agra. From here he made many scientific expeditions to the Himalayas resulting in pioneering contributions to High Altitude Entomology. He later made studies in the Pamir and Caucasus ranges leading to his work on Biogeography in India. The University of Agra awarded him a DSc degree in 1947 for his thesis submitted in 12 volumes. In 1956, he joined the ZSI as Deputy Director and retired as officiating director in 1968. In 1968 he returned to his first love, Scientific Research and became Emeritus Professor, at the School of Entomology, St. John's College, Agra and continued with his research work till 1984. He then finally left St. John's College and shifted to Madras, briefly worked with ZSI and since 1990 he was the Emeritus Professor, Botany Department at Presidency College, Madras and continued as a guide for PhD. research students, till 15 May 2002 when he moved to live temporarily, in Hyderabad, with his late sister Janaki's grandson, Jyotirmay Sharma, Editor, Times of India, Hyderabad. He then moved to Bangalore on 14 September 2002 to live with his only daughter, Mrs. Prema Subramanian and her husband V. S. Subramanian. Scientific works His published work includes over 250 original research papers, over 34 text books including his pioneering magnum opus, Ecology of Plant Galls. His outstanding Research work has been on Taxonomy of parasitic Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea and Proctotrupoidea), gall midges (Itonididae: Diptera) and ecology and histogenesis of plant galls. He is remembered most for his pioneering work in high altitude entomology. He led the first three Entomological Expeditions to the North West Himalaya in 1954, 1955 and 1956 and brought back a large collection of insects. He published several books like High Altitude Entomology, Ecology and Biogeography of India etc. He led a team of Indian scientists to the Soviet Union for conducting jointly a research project in 1963 and represented India in the UNESCO programme on Man and Biosphere (MAB) at Oslo, Norway. He was fluent in written and spoken German, well read in Sanskrit, he also had a keen interest in Dutch, French and Russian languages. Entomological Survey of the Himalaya, Alai-Pamir, Tien Shan, Kun Lun, Caucasus etc. His love of the mountains had begun as far back as 1950, when he went to the Nilgiris, Marudamalai Mountains with his son Visvanath; this was followed by similar visits to the mountains in north India, Dehra Dun 1950, Mussoorie/Chakrata 1952, Nainital, Garhwal Himalaya, (Hartola, 1952), Punjab / Himachal Himalaya, (Dhaula Dhar Range, 1953) and to Kullu, Manali region leading to the three pioneering expeditions, in 1954, 1955 and 1956, beyond the Pir Panjal Range, to the inner or Great Himalayan Range, in Lahaul & Spiti regions. He also extensively trekked and went on insect collection work in the mountain regions, Alai-Pamir, Tien Shan, Kun Lun, Caucasus, the Urals etc., of the former USSR, during his official tour in 1963, as the leader of the Indian team; he travelled extensively to various scientific institutes, at Moscow, Tbilisi, Leningrad, Kiev, Baku, Alma Ata, Samarkand, Tashkent etc.,. He also visited Oslo, in Norway on a similar invitation. He was a visiting professor at Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal. He went on an insect collection trip, to the Pacific islands, Fiji and conducted a field trip off Vanua Levu, in the area of Taveuni island, across the International dateline. He trained Visvanath to work with his students, and who accompanied him on most field collection expeditions and taught him methods of preparing slides, mounting insect specimens and proof reading of Research papers. His first son, Visvanath was his constant companion on his mountain trails, starting with the first time at Mardamalai in 1950. Visvanath went on to trek in Sikkim, Bhutan in 1965 and climb on his own in the Kulti Nala glacier and Inner Himalayan Range of Spiti, in 1967.

Those who produce these files (using the software called music trackers) and listen to them form the worldwide MOD scene, a part of the demoscene subculture. The mass interchange of \\"MOD music\\" or \\"tracker music\\" (music stored in module files created with trackers) evolved from early FIDO networks. Many websites host large numbers of these files, the most comprehensive of them being the Mod Archive. Nowadays, most module files, including ones in zipped form, are supported by most popular media players such as Winamp, VLC, Foobar2000, Amarok, Exaile and many others (mainly due to inclusion of common playback libraries such as libmodplug for gstreamer).  Structure  Module files store digitally recorded samples and several \\"patterns\\" or \\"pages\\" of music data in a form similar to that of a spreadsheet. These patterns contain note numbers, instrument numbers, and controller messages. The number of notes that can be played simultaneously depends on how many \\"tracks\\" there are per pattern. A disadvantage of module files is that there is no real standard specification in how the modules should be played back properly, which may result in modules sounding slightly different in different players. This is mostly due to effects that can be applied to the samples in the module file and how the authors of different players choose to implement them. However, tracker music has the advantage of requiring very little CPU overhead for playback, and is distributed as open- source and executed in real-time.  Popular formats  Each module file format builds on concepts introduced in its predecessors. ; The MOD format (.MOD) : The MOD format was the first file format for tracked music. A very basic version of this format (with only very few pattern commands and short samples supported) was introduced by Karsten Obarski‚Äôs Ultimate Soundtracker in 1987 for the Commodore Amiga. It was designed to use 4 channels and sixteen samples. Ultimate SoundTracker was soon superseded by NoiseTracker and ProTracker, which allowed for more tracker commands (effects) and instruments. Later, variants of the MOD format that appeared on the Personal Computer extended the number of channels, added panning commands (the Amiga‚Äôs four hardware channels had a pre-defined stereo setup) and expanded the Amiga‚Äôs frequency limit, allowing for more octaves of notes to be supported. : Arguably one of the most widespread tracker formats (also due to its use in many computer games and demos), it is also one of the simplest to use, but also only provides few pattern commands to use. ; The Oktalyzer format (.OKT) : This was an early effort to bring eight-channel sound to the Amiga. Later replayers have improved on the sound quality attainable from these modules by more demanding mixing technologies. ; The MED/OctaMED format (.MED) : This format is very similar to sound/pro/noisetracker, but the way the data is stored is different. MED was not a direct clone of SoundTracker, and had different features and file formats. OctaMED was an eight-channel version of MED, which eventually evolved into OctaMED Soundstudio (which offers 128-channel sound, optional synth sounds, MIDI support and many other high-end features). ; The AHX format (.AHX) : This format is a synth-tracker. There are no samples in the module file, rather descriptions of how to synthesize the required sound. This results in very small audio files (AHX modules are typically 1k‚Äì4k in size), and a very characteristic sound. AHX is designed for music with chiptune sound. The AHX tracker requires Kickstart 2.0 and 2 mb RAM memory. ; The ScreamTracker 3 format (.S3M) : The Scream Tracker 3 S3M format added sample tuning (defining the exact frequency of the middle C for samples), increased the number of playback channels, made use of an extra column specifically for volume control (which was extended by other trackers to handle panning commands as well), and compressed pattern data for smaller file sizes. It is also one of the few widespread formats that support both sample playback and realtime synthesis (through the OPL2 chip) at the same time. Open Cubic on DOSBox, playing a FastTracker 2 module called Dead Lock, composed by tracker musician Elwood in 1995 ; The FastTracker 2 format (.XM) : With the XM format, FastTracker 2 introduced the concept of \\"instruments\\", which applied volume and panning envelopes to samples. It also added the ability to map several samples to the same instrument for multi-sampled instruments or drum sets. XM uses instrument-based panning ‚Äì instrument numbers in patterns always reset the channel‚Äôs panning to the current sample's initial panning. It uses MOD effect command letters, plus a few of its own for more sound control. The composer can define initial tempos and speeds; provide envelopes to samples by assigning them to instruments; set sample looping and apply automatic sample vibrato oscillation. ; The Impulse Tracker format (.IT) : Impulse Tracker introduced the IT format, which, in comparison to the XM format, allows instruments to also specify the transposition of assigned samples depending on the note being played, applying resonant filters to samples, and defining ‚ÄúNew Note Actions‚Äù (NNAs) for instruments to release playing notes on a pattern channel while a new note is already playing, which helps to keep the number of pattern channels to while still being able to have a high polyphony. Like S3M files (and contrary to XM files), panning is channel-based, meaning that channels have an initial pan position which can be overridden by panning commands or instruments‚Äô and samples‚Äô default panning settings.  Scene  The process of composing module files, known as tracking, is a skillful activity that involves a much closer contact with musical sound than conventional composition, as every aspect of each sonic event is coded, from pitch and duration to exact volume, panning, and laying in numerous effects such as echo, tremolo and fades. Once the module file is finished, it is released to the tracker community. The composer uploads the new composition to one or more of several sites where module files are archived, making it available to their audience, who will download the file on their own computers. By encoding textual information within each module file, composers maintain contact with their audiences and with one another by including their email addresses, greetings to fans and other composers, and virtual signatures. Although trackers can be considered to have some technical limitations, they do not prevent a creative individual from producing music that is indiscernible from professionally created music. Many tracker musicians gained international prominence within MOD software users and some of them went on to work for high-profile video game studios, or began to appear on large record labels. Notable artists include Andrew Sega, Purple Motion, Darude, Alexander Brandon, Peter Hajba, Axwell, Venetian Snares, Jesper Kyd, TDK, Thomas J. Bergersen, Markus Kaarlonen, Michiel van den Bos and Dan Gardop√©e. It is also widely known that many of Aphrodite's early releases were made on two synchronized Amigas running OctaMED, and that James Holden made majority of his early material in Jeskola Buzz. Deadmau5 and Erez Eisen of Infected Mushroom have both used Impulse Tracker in their early career.  Music disk  Music disk, or musicdisk, is a term used by the demoscene to describe a collection of songs made on a computer. They are essentially the computer equivalent of an album. A music disk is typically packaged in the form of a program with a custom user interface, so the listener does not need other software to play the songs. The \\"disk\\" part of the term comes from the fact that music disks were once made to fit on a single floppy disk, so they could be easily distributed at demo parties. On modern platforms, music disks are usually downloaded to a hard disk drive. Amiga music disks usually consist of MOD files, while PC music disks often contain multichannel formats such as XM or IT. Music disks are also common on the Commodore 64 and Atari ST, where they use their own native formats. Related terms include music pack, which can refer to a demoscene music collection that does not include its own player, and chipdisk, a music disk containing only chiptunes, which have become popular on the PC given the large size of MP3 music disks.

It was built in 1987‚Äì1988 and completed in 1989 by Peter Argyrou Associates, to a design by postmodernist architect and developer Ian Pollard through his property development company, Flaxyard. The building was demolished in 2014. Design In the early 1990s, the building was described as \\"a high-tech glass cathedral\\", \\"palatial\\" and \\"architecturally magnificent\\" by the press, while traditionalists mocked its playfulness and 'PoMo' opulence. After Postmodernism fell out of fashion, the building, like many of the style, began to divide opinion and be mocked by some critics. The grey and white theme was echoed in silver birch trees which were planted in the forecourt of the Chelsea Bridge Business Centre/Observer offices side (the shorter side of the building). The two blocks were linked by a large, central glass atrium which featured iconic designer lifts and sanitation services. The building is sometimes mistakenly described as \\"marble clad\\", but the white-and-grey cladding is Neoparium, a luxury Japanese crystallised glass-ceramic material. Pollard favoured Neoparium over marble due to its hard wearing qualities in extreme weather conditions. When Pollard discovered the material, he was added late in the project at a great expense, but as the building was marketed as a luxury, high-specification development, this was justified. The dark tinted glass panels were customised Pilkington glass. It was originally home to British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) television and is believed to have taken its name from its first owner's Marcopolo satellites, although there is a suggestion that the name was a playful reference to the broken pediment roof detailing, which Pollard supposedly said was similar to the \\"Mark of the Polo\\", referencing the sweet. It is believed by many architecture critics that if the building had been allowed to stand for much longer, it would have been eligible for (and possibly have been granted) listed building status, limit redevelopment options for developers capitalising on the Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms area regeneration in the late 2010s. Usage Although typically referred to as 'Marco Polo House' or 'The QVC Building', Marcopolo was technically only one half of the building (the three-storey, taller side which was previously used as a television offices and studio). The other half of the adjoined structure was called originally to be called 'Chelsea Bridge Business Centre' and initially let to The Observer for its offices, although the Marcopolo name stuck. The building cost ¬£26 million to construct in 1987 (¬£61.9 million at 2014's rate) and was completed in 1989, at which time it was pre-let to BSB (who moved in during August 1989, fitted it out and officially launched in 1990) and The Observer. BSB promoted their move to the building in summer 1990 by sending customised Polo mints called 'Marcopolo - A Hole New Building' with their contact details on the wrapper instead of change-of- address cards to their PR contacts. The mints are on display at the National Media Museum. The chippendale-style broken pediment is also featured on Philip Johnson's postmodern Sony Tower in New York. The Observer newspaper resided in the building until it was acquired by The Guardian and it moved to their offices in Farringdon Road. When BSB merged with Sky to form BSkyB the new company kept the lease, and in October 1993, the building became home to shopping channel QVC's studios and offices. The smaller half of the building was also used as the offices for another ill-fated broadcaster, ONdigital, the UK's first digital terrestrial television broadcaster, from 1998. The company was re-launched in 2001 as ITV Digital who continued to use the ONdigital offices in the building until their subsequent demise in 2002. Demolition After a Russian consortium bought the freehold for more than ¬£60m in 2006, QVC decided not to renew its lease when it expired in 2012, citing expansion as the need to move. The channel looked for an alternative location ‚Äì including in several cities in the North of England ‚Äì for its 500 head office staff and studio centre. The channel's management ended broadcasting from the studios on 7 June 2012 and moved to a new studio complex at Chiswick Park, in West London \\"QVC moving to Chiswick Park\\", website of Stanhope plc, developer of the Chiswick Park site, 19 August 2010.

Accessed 7 January 2011. Press reports suggested\\"Marco Polo House faces demolition threat\\", Merlin Fulcher, Architects' Journal, London. Accessed 7 January 2011. that the architecturally and structurally sound Marco Polo House would be demolished, and replaced with a 12-storey luxury residential development, which was later revealed to be called Vista, designed by Scott Brownrigg. Marco Polo House's architect Pollard told the Architects' Journal the plan was a move towards a \\"lower grade of architecture\\", adding: \\"Marco was a fun building. It was quite an iconic at the time and some people still say it is.\\" Other critics said it was \\"Postmodern nonsense\\". \\"London Building : M\\" Adrian Welch and Isabelle Lomholt, e-architect, Undated. Accessed 7 January 2011. The Architects' Journals Merlin Fulcher told London's Evening Standard: \\"The new scheme looks decent, but it's always a shame to see an iconic structure knocked down, especially one that symbolises Eighties post-modernism so well.\\"\\"Eighties riverside landmark to be knocked down for flats\\" , Mara Bar-Hillel, Evening Standard, London, 20 April 2010. Accessed 7 January 2011. The building was in a serviceable state and had not reached the end of its life. It was used by Crisis At Christmas (as The Gate) to house the homeless over the Christmas 2013 period. Although the property was still available to let in December 2013 and classed as \\"modern TV studios/offices\\" by estate agent The Lorenz Consultancy, hoardings advertising Berkeley's replacement 'Vista' development were in place in January 2014. It is assumed that by this time internal soft-stripping had started. Marco Polo House demolition underway By 8 March 2014, exterior demolition had begun. As of the end of April 2014, the entire 'Marcopolo' side had been demolished and crushed, with the central glass atrium being eroded from the central lift areas outward; demolition of the 'Chelsea Bridge' side then proceeded from the inside, leaving the exterior walls and an empty shell until last. Due to the low-rise nature of the building, the demolition was carried out using several Komatsu, Volvo and Hitachi high-reach excavators and breakers, meaning that the deconstruction of the building was visible to the public and passengers on train services to and from London Victoria passing the site. The demolition contractor was Laing O'Rourke. Its demolition left Homebase Kensington as the last iconic Ian Pollard postmodern structure in London which, as of 2019, has also been demolished. Several former workers for the various companies which had resided at the building in its heyday, including journalist Jeremy Vine, expressed their sadness at the loss of the structure, with Vine calling it \\"symbolic\\" and stating that he was \\"amazed\\" that it had happened. In media The building was featured in the 2002 BBC Four documentary 'The Curse of Marco Polo House', 'Dreamspaces' (episode: '80s Architecture with Justine Frischmann) from BBC Three as well as the feature films 'Leon The Pig Farmer', 'The Business' and 'B. Monkey'. The distinctive, teal designer glass lifts from the central adjoining atrium, which had been installed from Marcopolo's inception, were featured in some scenes of the 1993 Red Dwarf episode 'Legion'. A video showing the interior during BSB days was included in the 'IBA Engineering Announcements - Tuesday April 26, 1990' ITV broadcast, which is (as of 2014) available to view on YouTube.

Location The location of Magan is not known with certainty, but most of the archaeological geological evidence suggests that Magan was part of what is now the United Arab Emirates and Oman. However, some archaeologists place it elsewhere, such as in the region of Yemen known as Ma'in,F. Hommel, Ethnologie und Geographie des alten Orients, (Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft von W. Otto, III. Abtl. I, Teil, Bd. I, Munich 1926), 550, 578 ff. in the south of Upper Egypt, in Nubia or the Sudan, and others as part of today's Iran and Pakistan. The latter location, specifically in the neighborhood of coastal Baluchistan, has been suggested on account of the similarity between Baluchistan's historical name, \\"Makran\\", and \\"Makkan\\", a variant of Magan. History Model of a Magan boat The first Sumerian mentions of a land of Magan (Sumerian Magan, Akkadian Makkan) are made during the Umm al-Nar period (2600‚Äì2000 BCE), as well as references to 'the Lords of Magan'. Sumerian sources also point to 'Tilmun' (accepted today as being centered in modern Bahrain) and Meluhha (thought to refer to the Indus Valley). Akkadian campaigns against Magan took place in the twenty-third century BCE, again possibly explaining the need for fortifications, and both Naram-Sin and Manishtusu, in particular, wrote of campaigning against '32 lords of Magan'. Gudea cylinders inscription A IX:19. Gudea mentions the devotions to his Temple: \\"Magan and Meluhha will come down from their mountains to attend\\".\\"I will spread in the world respect for my Temple, under my name the whole universe will gather in it, and Magan and Meluhha will come down from their mountains to attend\\" \\"J'√©tendrai sur le monde le respect de mon temple, sous mon nom l'univers depuis l'horizon s'y rassemblera, et [m√™me les pays lointains] Magan et Meluhha, sortant de leurs montagnes, y descendront\\" (cylinder A, IX:19)\\" in The words Magan (íà£íÉ∂) and Meluhha (íà®íàõíÑ©) appear vertically in the first column on the right. Naram-Sin gave the Akkadian title Malek to the defeated Ruler of Magan, a title which survives in the Arabic for king, malek. Magan was famed for its shipbuilding and its maritime capabilities. King Sargon of Agade (2371‚Äì2316 BCE) boasted that his ports were home to boats from Tilmun, Magan and Meluhha. His successor, Naram-Sin, not only conquered Magan, but honoured the Magan King Manium by naming the city of Manium-Ki in Mesopotamia after him. Trade between the Indus Valley and Sumer took place through Magan, although that trade appears to have been interrupted, as Ur-Nammu (2113‚Äì2096 BCE) laid claim to having 'brought back the ships of Magan'. Commerce Archaeological finds dating from this time show trade not only with the Indus Valley and Sumer, but also with Iran and Bactria. They have also revealed what is thought to be the oldest case on record of poliomyelitis, with the distinctive signs of the disease found in the skeleton of a woman from Tell Abraq, in modern Umm Al Quwain. Trade was common between Magan and Ur before the reigns of the Gutian kings over Ur. After they were deposed, Ur-Nammu of Ur restored the roads and trade resumed between the two nations (c. 2100 BC).Hamblin, William J. Warfare in the Ancient Near East to 1600 BC.

The current lineup of the band consists of Nik Fiend and Mrs. Fiend. Five of the group's albums and 12 of their singles reached top 20 positions in the UK indie charts in the period up to 1987. History Alien Sex Fiend were formed by Nik Wade (Nik Fiend), Christine Wade (Mrs. Fiend), David James (Yaxi Highrizer) and Johnny Freshwater (Johnny Ha-Ha) in late 1982 at the Batcave club in London (where Nik worked). The band became known in the gothic scene for its dark, electronic industrial-leaning sound, heavy samples, loops, dub remixes and manic vocals. Wade had previously been a member of the Alice Cooper-influenced bands the Earwigs and Mr. & Mrs. Demeanour, and later the punk band Demon Preacher (later known as the Demons). Alien Sex Fiend recorded a cassette (The Lewd, the Mad, the Ugly and Old Nick) with Youth of Killing Joke, which brought them to the attention of the UK music press, along with the appearance of their track \\"R.I.P.\\" on the Batcave club compilation, The Batcave: Young Limbs and Numb Hymns 1983, released by London Records in 1983. They signed to the Cherry Red sub-label Anagram Records, releasing their first single, \\"Ignore the Machine\\", in August 1983. The single was immediately successful on the UK Independent Chart, reaching No. 6. Their debut studio album, Who's Been Sleeping in My Brain, was released by Anagram on 1 November 1983, followed by Acid Bath in 1984. They released the world's first 11\\" single, \\"E.S.T. (Trip to the Moon)\\", that October. The band also recorded two BBC Peel Sessions in 1984. At the May session, they recorded \\"Attack!!!\\", \\"Dead and Buried\\", \\"Ignore the Machine\\" and \\"Hee Haw\\"; at the August session, \\"In God We Trust\\", \\"E.S.T. (Trip to the Moon)\\" and \\"Boneshaker Baby\\". In October 1985, their third studio album Maximum Security reached No. 100 on the UK Albums Chart and remained there for the week of 12 October. They also had two top 100 singles with \\"Dead and Buried\\" in August 1984 (No. 91) and a reissued \\"Ignore the Machine\\" in March 1985 (No. 99). Throughout the early 1980s, their work was frequently in the UK Indie Chart and remained a fixture on American college radio. The band also became popular in Japan, and in 1985, they released a live album recorded there, Liquid Head in Tokyo. Freshwater left later in 1985, and the band continued as a trio, supporting Alice Cooper on his \\"The Nightmare Returns\\" tour in 1986 and releasing \\"It\\" the Album that October. The band was reduced to a duo of the Wades when James left following the release of 1987's Here Cum Germs. In early 1988, the band, as the Dynamic Duo, recorded a one-off 12\\" single \\"Batman Theme\\" with recording and live engineer Len Davies, before continuing as Alien Sex Fiend, incorporating electronics and sampling even more into their sound on the album Another Planet, released in November 1988. They reverted to a four-piece with the 1989 addition of two prior guest collaborators, drummer/guitarist Andrew Wilson (a.k.a. Rat Fink Jr., formerly of the Turnpike Cruisers) and keyboardist/guitarist Simon \\"Doc\\" Milton, who made their official debut on that year's Too Much Acid? double-live album. Their seventh studio album, Curse, was released in October 1990. Fink and Milton departed in 1992, following that year's Open Head Surgery album and its subsequent tour (documented on The Altered States of America live album). The Wades then became a duo once again and provided the soundtrack for the Digital Image Design game Inferno in 1994. In 1996, the Wades launched their own 13th Moon label, issuing three further albums: Nocturnal Emissions (1997), Information Overload (2004) and Death Trip (2010). On 9 November 2018, Alien Sex Fiend released Possessed, their first album in eight years, on Cherry Red. Music style Alien Sex Fiend has been described as gothic rock, deathrock and industrial. Glenn Danzig has cited the group's sonorous and echoing sounds as having influenced the mixing for several of the recordings for his group Samhain. Later projects Fink published a book in 2000, Once Upon a Fiend, recalling his experiences in the band. He later drummed for Blackpool bands United States of Mind and Dog Food before joining Uncle Fester in 1999, who changed their name to UFX in 2006. Fink currently serves as frontman of Vince Ripper and the Rodent Show, a duo also featuring Vince \\"Ripper\\" Cornwall. They perform Alien Sex Fiend and the Cramps material, and have released two albums, It's Fun to Be a Monster and Boneyard a Go Go!!!.

It shows a slow rotation around an axis that is inclined along a position angle of . The absolute magnitude of M75 is about ‚àí8.5 or some 180,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The cluster has a half-light radius of with a core radius of about and appears not to have undergone core collapse yet. The mass density at the core is *pc‚àí3. There are 38 RR Lyrae variable stars and the cluster appears to be Oosterhoff-intermediate in terms of metallicity. 62 candidate blue stragglers have been identified in the cluster field, with 60% being in the core region. Messier 75 is part of the Gaia Sausage, the hypothesized remains of a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way. It is a halo object with an orbital period of 0.4 Gyr around the galaxy and a large eccentricity of 0.87. The apocenter is ‚Äì close to the current separation.

Both versions have same compression ratio 18.3:1. Torque output (both versions have same maximum at 2000 rpm), fuel efficiency and NOx emissions were improved by using: * expansive vertical vortex combustion (EVVC), which combines a special piston surface design, with ingenious fuel distribution, to produce a vertical swirl in the combustion chamber * variable turbine geometry (VNT) turbocharger Combined fuel economy is achieving and emission rating Euro Stage III (D4) with on a regular basis mounted catalytic converter with Lambda probe and exhaust-gas recirculation system (EGR). Engines were mounted in (in order of appearance): * 1st generation Mazda 6 Atenza (both versions) since June 2002 * 2nd generation Mazda MPV (only High Power version) since June 2002 =RF 2005 (2.0 MZR-CD)= Production of improved, cleaner and more powerful common rail direct-injection turbocharged version of Mazda RF engine was started with July 2005 Mazda 6 facelift. This drivetrain still has most of typical features of its predecessor including belt-driven SOHC valve train with rocker arms and mechanically adjusted screws (in contrast to frequently mismatched, absolutely different ZSD or PSA DW10 Ford Duratorq engines). Mazda applied several technologies to this MZR-CD engine to achieve Euro Stage IV: * new variable geometry turbocharger has 14 percent less inertial moment and is more compact in design (achieved, for instance, by a shorter distance between the exhaust gas inlet and the turbine shaft) * Denso's 1800 bar second generation common rail system that, depending on driving conditions, uses multi-stage injection of up to nine times per cycle with six-hole injectors * relatively low compression ratio of 16.7:1 improves power output and torque(???), while at the same time helping to lower combustion noise and emissions * NOx emissions were reduced by lowering the engine's combustion temperature * O2 sensor constantly measures residual oxygen in the exhaust gases and this information is sent to 32-bit powertrain control module (PCM), which continuously optimizes the air/fuel mix There were two power versions of this engine: Standard Power at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of at 2000 rpm, High Power at 3500 rpm and a maximum torque of at 2000 rpm. Both versions come with a DPF system standard, which traps soot in a coated ceramic filter. As soon as the filter's storage capacity is exhausted, exhaust gas temperature is raised for a short period (using only diesel pre and post-injection techniques, not any fuel burner additive) and the particles burn off. As a result, the RF 2005 engines emit 80 percent less particulate matter than required by Euro Stage IV standards. Engines were mounted in (in order of appearance): * 1st generation Mazda 6 Atenza (both versions) since July 2005 * Mazda 5 Premacy (both versions) since January 2006 * 1st generation Mazda 3 Axela (only High Power version) since March 2007 =RF 2007 (2.0 MZR-CD)= Slightly detuned at 3500 rpm and at 2000 rpm) version of RF 2005 engine was introduced in November 2007's second generation Mazda 6.

It was discovered by Pierre M√©chain in 1780 and included in Charles Messier's catalog of comet-like objects as number 76. It was first recognised as a planetary nebula in 1918 by the astronomer Heber Doust Curtis. However, there is some contention to this claim, as Isaac Roberts in 1891 did suggest that M76 might be similar to the Ring Nebula (M57), being instead as seen from the side view. The structure is now classed as a bipolar planetary nebula (BPNe). Distance to M76 is currently estimated as 780 parsecs or 2,500 light years, making the average dimensions about 0.378 pc. (1.23 ly.) across. The total nebula shines at the apparent magnitude of +10.1 with its central star or planetary nebula nucleus (PNN) at +15.9v (16.1B) magnitude. The UV-light from the PNN is expanding outer layers that form the present nebula, and has the surface temperature of about 88,400 K. The whole planetary nebula is approaching us at 19.1 km/s. The Little Dumbbell Nebula derives its common name from its resemblance to the Dumbbell Nebula (M27) in Vulpecula. It was originally thought to consist of two separate emission nebulae and was thus given two catalog numbers in the NGC 650 and 651.

It lies between Trumpington Road to the west, Bateman Street to the north and Hills Road to the east. The garden covers an area of 16 hectares (40 acres).TL4557: Cambridge University Botanic Garden, Geograph. The site is almost entirely on level ground and in addition to its scientific value, the garden is highly rated by gardening enthusiasts. It holds a plant collection of over 8,000 plant species from all over the world to facilitate teaching and research. The garden was created for the University of Cambridge in 1831 by Professor John Stevens Henslow (Charles Darwin's mentor) and was opened to the public in 1846. The highest temperature recorded in the UK, 38.7 ¬∞C (101.7 ¬∞F), was recorded on 25 July 2019 at the garden. History =Walkerian Garden= The New Museums Site on Free School Lane was once the home to the Walkerian Garden. Eventually, the University built the Cavendish Laboratory here, but a small patch of garden has been planted with plants representative of the stock of the original garden. tree that inspired Isaac Newton to formulate his theory of gravitation After several unsuccessful attempts during the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries, a University Botanic Garden was finally established at Cambridge between 1760 and 1763. This was not on the site of the present Garden, but in the centre of the town, on about 5 acres of land then occupied by 'The Mansion House' of the old Augustinian friary, and today by the New Museums Site and other university buildings. It was Dr. Richard Walker, Vice-Master of Trinity College, who, on the advice of Philip Miller of the Chelsea Physic Garden, purchased the property for ¬£1,600, and presented it to the University for use as a Botanic Garden. For some years the Garden was known as the Walkerian Botanic Garden, and there is, at the present Garden, a Walkerian Society named in honour of its founder. The Walkerian Garden was laid out and developed by the then professor of botany, Thomas Martyn. This small Garden was conceived as a typical Renaissance physic garden, inspired by the Chelsea Physic Garden in London. It grew herbaceous plants used in the teaching of medical students at the University. Glasshouses and a lecture room for the professor were built and the teaching of botany in Cambridge, which was then at a low ebb, received, for a time, a considerable stimulus. This improvement, however, did not last for long. Martyn left in 1798 and only visited Cambridge only occasionally until his death in 1825. About 1790 James Donn was appointed Curator and in 1796 he published the first edition of Hortus Cantabrigiensis, a list of the plants in the Garden which reached its 13th edition in 1845, long after Donn's death. =Botanic Garden= In 1825 John Stevens Henslow, Charles Darwin's teacher at Cambridge, succeeded Martyn as professor of botany and soon realized that a larger site, farther from the centre of Cambridge, was desirable for the Botanic Garden. In 1831 the University purchased the present site of about 40 acres to the south of the town on the Trumpington Road, and in 1846 the first tree was planted. It had been the intention to lay out the whole 40 acres as a Botanic Garden, but presumably funds were lacking, and in fact only 20 acres were planted, the remainder being let out as allotments. The planning of the new Garden was carried out by Professor Henslow, assisted by young Cardale Babington. The land was flat and unpromising as a garden site, but the layout was planned with great skill, utilizing an old gravel pit to construct a lake with a high mound running into it. Trees and shrubs were planted according to their botanical sequence, a range of glasshouses was built in the 1860s, and a rock garden, one of the earliest of its kind in the country, was constructed about the same time. The Garden has also long been known for its many fine specimens of rare trees. By the 1870s the main features of the Garden had been developed and, it was ready to play its part in the great expansion of botanical teaching and research that was about to take place at Cambridge. During the early years of the 20th century much of the pioneer work of William Bateson, Charles Chamberlain Hurst, and Edith Rebecca Saunders on plant genetics was carried out at the Garden, and it was later used for researches on plant physiology by Frederick Blackman and George Edward Briggs, and on plant pathology by Frederick Tom Brooks and others. On 25 July 2019, a new UK temperature record was set at 38.7C (101.7F) within the gardens, which exceeded the previous record of 38.5C (101.3F) set in Faversham on 10 August 2003. Research Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University Department of Plant Sciences' Plant Growth Facility The chair of Botany at Cambridge was created in 1724 for Richard Bradley (1724‚Äì1732), and as of 2016, fifteen botanists have held that position, including John Martyn (1733‚Äì1762), John Stevens Henslow (1825‚Äì1861) and Harry Marshall Ward (1895‚Äì1906) (see list). In 1991 the Botany School was renamed the Department of Plant Sciences. In 2005 the title was changed to Regius Professor of Botany, the appointment as of 2016 is that of Professor Sir David Baulcombe. The current Plant Sciences building on the Downing Site was constructed in 1904 during Ward's tenure, when the main areas of research were morphology, systematics, pathology and physiology. Morphologists in that period included Agnes Arber, John Corner, and Kenneth Sporne, whose phylogenetic approach was well ahead of the seminal work of Willi Hennig. In 1921 the University appointed H. Gilbert-Carter as the first scientific Director of the Garden, in conjunction with the curatorship of the herbarium and who published the first guide to the garden. Amongst other directors of the garden were John Gilmour (1951‚Äì1973), and Max Walters (1973‚Äì1983) who published a history of the garden in 1981. The current director is Beverley Glover (2013‚Äì) (see list). The newly built Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University (SLCU) in the grounds of the garden is a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary new research institute. Focusing on the regulatory systems underlying plant growth and development, the Lab uses cutting edge scientific resources and predictive computational models to further understand of the dynamic, self-organising properties of plants. It was funded by Lord Sainsbury, chancellor of the university, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in April 2011. It houses the university herbarium, moved from the Downing Site in 2011.

Early life  She was born Rebecca Jayne Atkinson, the only surviving child from her mother Beverley Callard's first marriage to Paul Atkinson. Her parents divorced in 1978, and her mother remarried three times, to David Sowden, Steven Callard, and Jon McEwan.

It is in common use in several Commonwealth armies, where it is held by the regiment's patron, usually a member of the royal family. The position was formerly used in the armies of several European monarchies. A Colonel-in-Chief has a purely ceremonial role in their regiment. The Norwegian Army has taken a more whimsical approach to the position, appointing the penguin Sir Nils Olav as a Colonel-in-Chief.Norwegian Consulate in Edinburgh.  History  Historically a Colonel-in-Chief was the ceremonial head of a regiment, usually a member of a European country's royal family. The practice extends at least back to 1740 in Prussia when Frederick II held that position in the newly created Garde du Corps, an elite heavy cavalry regiment.Colonel-in-Chiefs belonging to the Hohenzollern Family By the late 19th Century the designation could be given to the children of royalty; pictures exist of the daughters of Russian Czar Nicholas II in the uniforms of their regiments.Granduchessa Maria Nikolaevna di Russia The German Kaiser Wilhelm II carried the title to an extreme, holding it in literally dozens of German and (by diplomatic courtesy) Austro- Hungarian, British, Russian, and Portuguese regiments. In addition, his mother, wife, son, and daughters were also full or deputy Colonels-in-Chief of various units.Colonel-in-Chiefs belonging to the Hohenzollern Family  Role  In modern usage, the Colonel-in-Chief of a regiment is its (usually royal) patron, who has a ceremonial role in the life of the regiment. They do not have an operational role, or the right to issue orders, but are kept informed of all important activities of the regiment and pay occasional visits to its units. The chief purpose of the Colonel-in-Chief is to maintain a direct link between the regiment and the royal family. Some artillery regiments have a Captain-General instead of a Colonel-in-Chief, but the posts are essentially the same. The position of Colonel-in-Chief is distinct from the other ceremonial regimental posts of Colonel of the Regiment and Honorary Colonel, which are usually retired military officers or public figures with ties to the regiment. Colonels-in-Chief are appointed at the invitation of the regiment. While it is traditional for a royal personage to hold the position,See this list of Colonel-in-Chief appointments held by The Prince of Wales. it is at the discretion of the regiment or corps whom they invite. , most Colonels-in- Chief in the British Army are members of the British royal family. However, two foreign monarchs hold the position: *The King of Jordan - The Light Dragoons *The Queen of Denmark - The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires) Winston Churchill inspecting the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, of which he was Honorary Colonel, in Italy during 1944 In the past non-royal persons have held, or been invited to hold, the post of Colonel-in-Chief.

He first appears in the original Mortal Kombat as an unplayable character, challenging the player before the final fight with Shang Tsung. Goro is a member of the four-armed half-human, half-dragon race, called the Shokan. In the original game he has been champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament for 500 years before being defeated by eventual tournament champion Liu Kang. Unlike most characters in the game, who were digitized representations of live actors, Goro was a clay sculpture animated through stop motion. The character was not in the next two Mortal Kombat titles, which instead featured two other Shokan fighters, Kintaro and Sheeva. He returned in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, this time as a playable character. Goro returned in the home versions of Mortal Kombat 4 as a sub-boss and an unlockable character. In contrast to his previous role as a villain, in the storyline of Mortal Kombat 4 he aligns himself on the side of good. He returned to a villainous role as a playable character in the GameCube and PSP versions of Mortal Kombat Deception, forming a pact with Shao Kahn. Goro also made subsequent appearances in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon as well as the Mortal Kombat reboot and its sequel Mortal Kombat X. Goro is seen as one of the iconic characters of the series, with various publications listing him as one of the most memorable and difficult bosses in video game history. He has also appeared in other franchise media, such as comics and the live action film as well as its animated film, Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins. Concept and design According to John Tobias, Goro was created when he and Ed Boon discussed bringing \\"a big brooding character\\" to the first Mortal Kombat. The original concept of the character was a two- handed humanoid character Rokuro, a member of \\"a race of demon warriors called Rokuro-kubi (demons of the dark)\\" wrongly \\"reputed as savage barbarians\\", who would join the tournament \\"to restore the pride and respect of his race\\".Another page from my ancient MK notebook: a discarded charact... on Twitpic. The idea for a stop motion animated monster boss and a character with four arms came from the films Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts and from one of the Sinbad movies, respectively. Unlike other characters in the first Mortal Kombat, Goro was not based on a digitized actor but instead on a clay sculpture created by Richard Divizio's friend Curt Chiarelli. Tobias, who considers Goro probably his favourite character in the series, recalled: \\"Goro was originally called Gongoro, but we decided to shorten his name. My original concept sketch had Goro with 3 fingers and a thumb on each hand. Curt Chiarelli wisely changed it to 2 fingers and a thumb.\\"John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter (the original concept art). Chiarelli elaborated: \\"In my experience and opinion, the first cardinal rule of fantasy character design is maintaining the illusion of anatomical and physiological functionality within the framework of a consistent, aesthetic integrity; and the second is that the simpler and cleaner the forms, the more iconic the creature will be. I suggested some minor revisions, like a decrease in the diameter of Goro‚Äôs biceps to facilitate easier animation of the arms, as well as make the number of digits on his hands and feet uniform, as is the pattern in all vertebrates.\\" After creating it, he used it as a base for a latex model to make a painted miniature. After recording a video of an actor making motions similar to those Goro would make in the game, Tobias used stop motion animation to move the miniature's body to match the actor's movements frame for frame. According to Boon, the clay sculpture used to animate Goro in the first Mortal Kombat was twisted around and bent so many times that it simply fell apart. In Goro's Deception bio card, when explaining how Goro was animated, Boon mentions a second model for Goro had also been created; this second model was not used for animation and is still in usable condition to this day, and is also currently in Boon's personal possession. In video games Goro became Grand Champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament after defeating the Great Kung Lao. For 500 years, he remained undefeated and helped Shang Tsung grow ever closer to achieving Shao Kahn's goal of domination over Earthrealm. In his 10th title defense, however, he faced Liu Kang. Making use of Goro's overconfidence after years of being the undefeated warrior, Liu Kang was able to secure victory. Goro disappeared during the tournament's aftermath, and he was believed to be dead. It is theorized that he actually retreated to his kingdom during this time. Goro is succeeded by another member of his race, Kintaro, as Kahn's right-hand man during the events of Mortal Kombat II. Goro reappears in Mortal Kombat Trilogy as a playable character as well as in the 2011 game. Goro would resurface after Kahn's downfall, during the events of Mortal Kombat 4. Despite having the intent to avenge his losses at Liu Kang's hands, Goro began to take an interest in the matters of his own race and joined his fellow Shokans in a war against the Centaurians. Princess Kitana intervened and negotiated a truce and peace accord between the two races. The meeting was interrupted by Kung Lao who desired to challenge his ancestor's killer. The Shaolin monk lashed out with a ceremonial strike of revenge that left Goro's chest scarred. Considering the score settled, the two shook hands. When Shinnok and his legion were defeated and Edenia was free once more, Goro and the Shokan race decided to ally themselves with the Edenians, agreeing to sign a peace treaty with the Centaurs as a condition of their new partnership. Years later, during the time of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, the united Edenian and Shokan forces attacked the weakened Shao Kahn's armies. Exhausted from battle, Goro was struck from behind by Noob Saibot. He was mortally wounded, apparently dying from the injury, and Kitana held a royal funeral for the fallen Shokan prince. However, Goro was able to survive, being saved from death by Shao Kahn himself, with the promise of returning the Shokans to their former glory and the banishment of the Centaurs in exchange for his allegiance. Agreeing to these terms, Goro placed his royal seal on a nearby disfigured fallen Shokan (whom Kitana and the Shokan army found and mistook for him, successfully deceiving them while hiding his defection), and resumed his place at Shao Kahn's side. Goro also appears as a boss character in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, attacking both Liu Kang and Kung Lao. In Konquest Mode of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Goro is confronted in Shao Kahn's fortress by Taven who wishes to kill Quan Chi but must get past Goro in order to do so. Taven eventually defeats Goro, who storms off. In the 2011 game, Goro reprises his role from the first tournaments. Goro is playable in the 2015 Mortal Kombat X as a bonus pre-order character. His absence from the main story mode is answered in the prequel comics: the Shokan did not ally with Mileena or Kotal Kahn, and thus were shunned by both and forced into being outcasts. He also serves as the last character the player faces before Shinnok in the Classic Ladder mode. By Mortal Kombat 11, Goro is revealed to have been killed. His corpse also appears in his lair. In other media Goro had a prominent role in Malibu's Mortal Kombat comic book adaptations and was the first character to have his own three-issue miniseries, entitled Goro: Prince of Pain. Goro's story did not differ greatly from his in-game profiles, being the Mortal Kombat champion and having previously bested the Great Kung Lao. He was also portrayed as an unstoppable force, easily dispatching the Earthrealm warriors alone, and only having a hard time against Raiden. He remained undefeated during the first three issues of the Blood & Thunder series, having lost for the first time in the second issue of Prince of Pain against Zaggot's creation, the Kombatant. In the following Battlewave series, he remained on Earth after his defeat, and, to appease for his failure, started hunting down the Earthrealm warriors; he injured Jax in battle but was unable to defeat Liu Kang. In the fourth issue he had a mini-story at the end (\\"When Titans Clash\\") where he returned to Outworld to fight for Shao Kahn, settling a rivalry with Kintaro along the way. Goro appears as the champion of Mortal Kombat in the first Mortal Kombat movie, in accordance with his original story. In the movie, Goro is portrayed as an evil warrior, steeped in the authoritarian traditions of Outworld and does not look favorably upon humans. After defeating a long series of opponents, including Johnny Cage's friend Art Lean, he is in turn defeated and sent falling off a cliff to his death by Cage. For the film's production, Goro was an animatronic suit (costing over $1 million and requiring over a dozen puppeters to operate entirely) voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, with vocal effects also provided by Frank Welker. In the novel based on the film, Goro was shown to be a slightly more noble creature. Goro still fell off the cliff to his death, but rather than having this inflicted upon him by Johnny Cage, Goro deliberately dropped himself, explaining that he would rather die than live in disgrace, and that Shokan warriors die in battle. In the animated film Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, Goro confronts his older brother Durak for a jeweled egg in which the winner was to tribute to their father Gorbak. He ends up losing the fight after hanging from a cliff while Durak tries to help him up. Goro betrays his brother and knocks him into the pit. Goro was originally meant to appear in Mortal Kombat: Legacy season 2 and then in the ultimately cancelled season 3. He does make a guest appearance the 2018 film Ready Player One. Goro is set to appear in the Direct-to-video animated film Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge, voiced again by Richardson. Goro appeared in the RoosterTeeth animated web series Death Battle, fighting against Machamp from the Pok√©mon franchise. In it, Goro held the advantage in experience and presumed punching speeds but ultimately lost against Machamp's skill, moveset and vastly superior strength and toughness. Reception Goro was awarded the titles of Best Villain in the 1993 Nintendo Power Awards (\\"best, worst and biggest bad boy of them all\\")Nintendo Power 73, May 1994. and the Hottest Gaming Hunk of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. His role in the Mortal Kombat games have been well-received; Techtree stated that while Goro was not the main boss from the first game, he was probably the hardest boss. GameSpot praised Goro's moves in Mortal Kombat 4 as in contrast to the game's boss, Shinnok, he is harder to defeat. According to GameSpot, the fight against Goro in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks was however very easy to win, in contrast to other boss fights from the same game. He was ranked No. 20 in \\"The 47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time\\" poll by GamePro in 2008, and No. 67 in the list of \\"Top 100 Videogame Villains\\" by IGN. UGO.com featured him in their \\"Top 11 Mortal Kombat Characters\\" list, with comments focused on his appearance due to the \\"twist\\" his first appearance gave since he was very different from the other characters. UGO also ranked him as the 15th hardest boss in video games. GameSpot's list of the \\"Top Ten Boss Fights\\" featured Goro due to how difficult it was to defeat him in Mortal Kombat, with a note that despite the introductions of bosses similar to Goro in sequels, Goro still remained the \\"grand champion\\". Goro was featured in Uneality's \\"Six Memorable Boss Fights in Video Games\\", who commented that he was scary and that one felt helpless against those four arms. GamePlayBook listed Goro as the seventh best Mortal Kombat character, who commented that he was still awesome after all these years and praised his grab-and-pound move and charging punches. Cheat Code Central ranked Goro as the fourth best Mortal Kombat character, who commented that \\"Midway completely outdid themselves\\" with his implementation in the first MK game. In UGO Networks' 2012 list of top Mortal Kombat characters, Goro placed 22nd. His addition to the Nintendo GameCube port of Mortal Kombat: Deception received positive response by Greg Kasavin of GameSpot; he claimed Goro and Shao Khan fit well within Deception despite looking \\"anemic\\". GameSpy's Miguel Lopez described Goro as a \\"legendary villain\\" but at the same criticized his physical appearance from Deception as his \\"anatomical proportions seem a little off\\". IGN listed him as a character they would like to see as downloadable content for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, noting \\"Goro was the real challenge\\" of the first Mortal Kombat title although Shang Tsung was the final boss from such game, adding that \\"MK is all about visceral thrills, and it doesn't get more visceral than bludgeoning your enemies to death with four giant, muscular arms\\". In a 1994 article by Business Week, the film version of Goro was described as \\"the most advanced mechanical creature H[o]llywood has ever made\\". When the release of a third Mortal Kombat live-action film was announced, IGN listed him as a character they wanted to see fighting in the film, but made with CGI technology as opposed to the practical effects used in the first movie.

Early and personal life Walsh is a native of New Ross, County Wexford. Walsh attended New Ross Christian Brothers School. He is married to Marie Furlong, they have one son and two daughters. Outside of his Seanad duties, he works as a businessman and company director. He is a member of the Chartered Institute of Transport, a Senator of Junior Chamber International and is a former president of the Irish Road Hauliers' Association. Political career He was elected in 1974 to New Ross Town Council, serving as Mayor for nine terms and a member of Wexford County Council from 1979 to 2004, serving as Mayor from 1992 to 1993. Walsh was National Chairman of the Irish Local Authority Members Association from 1997 to 2002. In 1997, he was first elected to Seanad √âireann by the Agricultural Panel. From 1997 to 2002, he served as government spokesman on Environment and Local Government in the Seanad. In subsequent terms he served as government spokesperson on Justice, Equality, and Law Reform between 2002 and 2007, and Communications, Energy, and Natural resources from 2007 to 2011. He is currently the Fianna F√°il Seanad spokesman on Foreign Affairs and Trade and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee. He is currently a Board Member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, a New York-based non- governmental organization dealing with peace, democracy, human rights and the rules of law. He is also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as being a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and a participant in the International Catholic Legislator's Network since its inauguration. Walsh has fulfilled a number of international speaking invitations in recent years. In 2011 he was invited to address a conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka on the Northern Ireland peace process. At the invitation of the Pontifical Council for the Family he read a paper on the topic of \\"The Family\\" at the World Meeting of Families in Milan, May 2012. At the PGA Conference in Bogota, Colombia, December 2013 he addressed the subject of \\"Disarmament and Decommissioning- The Northern Ireland Experience and its Relevance for Colombia. =Tribunals= In April 2008, Walsh claimed \\"that Chairmen of some of the tribunals used their position in order to act more or less as shop stewards for the wealthy legal profession\\". He later withdrew the comment, acknowledging that he may have caused offence. =Civil partnership legislation= On 24 April 2008, Walsh put forward a party motion to counter the proposed same-sex Civil Partnership Bill. The Irish Times reported that around 30 unidentified Fianna F√°il backbenchers had signed the motion. One anonymous Senator was quoted as claiming that the motion \\"would have considerable support from the more conservative sections of the parliamentary party\\". The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, responded by insisting that the registration of same-sex couples would not interfere with the constitutional status of marriage. Cowen noted that the Bill had been drawn up in close consultation with the Attorney General and had been included in the programme for government. The motion was referred to the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party's justice committee on 1 July 2008. Despite the challenge to the Bill, a Fianna F√°il spokesperson was quoted as saying that there was \\"broad support\\" within the party for the legislation, while the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern reaffirmed the constitutional compatibility of the proposed law. Walsh has repeatedly called for a freedom of conscience amendment to the legislation which would by-pass equality legislation, allowing people a religious exemption in providing goods and services to gay couples. In the 2014 \\"Pantigate\\" controversy in which the national broadcaster RT√â paid a purported ‚Ç¨85,000 to conservative commentators, Walsh argued that some proponents of same-sex marriage were \\"dangerous and vicious\\". On 31 March 2015, he said in the Seanad that he could not support same sex marriage and that the money spent on the Marriage Equality referendum would be better spent on testing the gay community for HIV. =Views= In November 2009, Walsh claimed that women working outside the home is a major cause of depression in young people, and also expressed annoyance that \\"David Norris could describe gay people as ‚Äòfairies‚Äô ‚Äì while he could not\\". On 7 July 2010, he resigned the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party whip, along with Labhr√°s √ì Murch√∫ and John Hanafin, in protest at the Civil Partnership bill. He rejoined the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party on 23 November 2010. On 16 July 2013, Walsh opposed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, and during the Seanad debate quoted an anti-abortion pamphlet's description of dilation and evacuation, which the bill's supporters criticised as inappropriate. In December 2015, in abortion-related debate, Walsh told Senator Ivana Bacik that she should seek 'treatment for hemorrhoids'. In January 2016, he was re-admitted to the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party. He did not contest the 2016 Seanad election.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/seanad-adjourns- indefinitely-as-tributes-paid-to-retiring-senators-1.2521573 =Wikipedia editing= In September 2015, Walsh admitted editing his own Wikipedia entry, claiming it had been edited by \\"a person from the gay lobby groups\\". He said that he had removed \\"certain erroneous comments\\" but did not say which edits he made or what was erroneous. T.J. McIntyre, a law lecturer at University College Dublin drew attention to edits made from an IP address belonging to the Oireachtas. Edits made from that address included removal of controversial comments made by the former senator about gay people and the Marriage Equality referendum.

He is considered one of the most innovative and visionary thinkers in the game. In 2014 he was posthumously inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame.https://www.worldrugby.org/halloffame/inductees/4696 Playing career Greenwood was born in Fife and educated at Dunfermline High School and Edinburgh University, where he read English. He played club rugby for Dunfermline RFC and the North and Midlands team.Jones, p34 He also played for Harlequins, the RAF and Eastern Counties during his national service in the RAF. After touring with the British Lions, he played for Perthshire Academicals.Massie, p184 His first international was in 1952 against , but he was dropped shortly afterwards.Massie, p185 However, he played well in the District matches and trials of 1954, leading to his re-selection for the national team. He became Scottish captain, but after losing 15‚Äì0 to , lost that position to Angus Cameron, while keeping his place on the team. In the next season, he became captain once more, and led the side for three more years. He played mostly at No 8, but also at flanker, a position at which he was capped four times by the British Lions against during the Lions‚Äô 1955 tour. Greenwood played 16 matches on the tour, and scored tries in the first and fourth tests of the series, which the Lions drew 2-2 with South Africa. In a newspaper report at the time, he was described as \\"without equal among his contemporaries for a combination of skill, perception and deadly physical pace.\\" He played 18 games for the Barbarians between 1955 and 1958, the last being on 28 May 1958 at the RFUEA Ground, Nairobi, versus East Africa; a ground that he had previously visited whilst on tour with the Lions, though on that occasion he had not been selected to play.Cambell and Cohen, p23 He also played for the combined Ireland/Scotland team against England/Wales in the 1959 Twickenham Jubilee match. Greenwood was in contention for a place on the next Lions tour (in 1959), but suffered an injury (variously described as a broken collarbone or dislocated shoulder) playing against Ireland that season. Although he bravely played on, switching from number eight to flanker to accommodate his injury, he was forced to retire, aged 31. Allan Massie wrote of him that: :\\"He was not a devastating tackler like Douglas Elliot or Ron Glasgow, though he was a very safe one. His first quality was his mobility; he was an example to young back-row players in the way he kept close to the ball and in his anticipation of the run of play. It brought him one notable Test try in South Africa when he gathered a cross-kick to surge over the line. He was one of the last forwards to be a notably good dribbler of the ball.\\" Coaching career Greenwood was a teacher by profession, and taught at Glenalmond College, Cheltenham College and at Tiffin School in Kingston upon Thames. He moved to Loughborough Colleges (now Loughborough University) in 1968, teaching English, Comparative Studies and coaching rugby. At Loughborough he influenced generations of rugby players, coaches and students including Clive Woodward, Andy Robinson, Fran Cotton, and Liza Burgess. Greenwood was an advocate of fifteen man 'total rugby', the whole team playing as a unit, and capable of both back and forward play.McLaren, p150 He was considered one of rugby's leading thinkers, and has often been described as a coaching guru. In the 1970s Greenwood ran rugby coaching courses at Loughborough's Summer Schools, attended by coaches from across the UK and from countries such as Spain and Portugal. He later toured the world coaching and advising, helping to establish coaching structures in Argentina, Japan, the US and Canada. He spent two years at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, and earned the nickname 'Mr Rugby' in New Zealand. He also coached the England women's team, although he never coached a Scotland team. He published three books ‚Äì Improve Your Rugby (1967), Total Rugby (1978) and Think Rugby (1986). Total Rugby and Think Rugby are considered seminal books on rugby coaching, and have been updated and reprinted numerous times due to demand, as recently as 2015. Greenwood described his views on the game: :\\"The rugby I‚Äôm concerned with as a coach is rugby at its most exciting ‚Äì the 15-man handling game, in which every player is encouraged to show what we can do as an attacker, defender and supporting players, and in which the overall style of play gives him a chance to do so. :I was a teacher rather than a coach. I tried to get people thinking. I wanted each player to be his own coach, to encourage the player to expand their awareness, to find truth wherever it lay. All coaching is one-to-one: there's a place for the motivational speech, but it's far more effective to talk to people individually.\\" Clive Woodward wrote of Greenwood: :\\"Basically, I went to Loughborough for one reason, to play my best rugby, and for one man, Jim Greenwood. If I was going to play for England, it made sense to go where the best coach was‚Ä¶ Jim‚Äôs book, Total Rugby, is the only rugby coaching book I‚Äôve ever read. It was way ahead of its time, and has since become a closely studied classic, especially in New Zealand‚Ä¶ No man has done more in our time to single-handedly transform the modern game of rugby than Jim Greenwood.\\" He retired to the village of Crossmichael near Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire although he remained in demand as a consultant. He died aged 81 in 2010. Honours In 1998 Greenwood was one of the inaugural inductees into the National Coaching Foundation's Hall of Fame, and won the prestigious Geoffrey Dyson Award for his outstanding contribution.

In 1955, he was shot dead in broad daylight around 10 a.m. at close range on the lawn of the Lincoln County courthouse in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Details Lamar Smith, a 63-year-old farmer and World War I veteran, was a voting rights activist and a member of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL). On August 2, he voted in the primary and helped get others out to vote. There was a run-off primary scheduled for August 23. On August 13, Smith was at the courthouse helping other black voters to fill out absentee ballots so they could vote in the runoff without exposing themselves to violence at the polls. He was shot to death in front of the courthouse in Brookhaven, Lincoln County, at around 10 a.m. Contemporary reports say there were at least 30 white witnesses, including the local sheriff, who saw a white man covered with blood leaving the scene. In spite of a public effort by prosecutor E.C. Barlow to obtain testimony, no witnesses would come forward. The three men who had been arrested went free. Smith apparently had attended meetings of RCNL, probably the largest civil rights organization in the state. He was also a personal friend of RCNL president T. R. M. Howard of Mound Bayou. In 2005, Filmmaker Keith Beauchamp created a documentary, Murder in Black and White of Smith's murder. In 2009, Beachamp and the FBI attempted to interview witnesses in Brookhaven. In 2018, this murder came into the national spotlight when it was learned the murderer was related to the husband of senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who made campaign comments, which she claimed were jokes, about public hangings and cast voter suppression in a positive light. Background Smith's murder was one of several racially motivated attacks in Mississippi in 1955. The other incidents included the murder of George W. Lee, a civil rights leader in Belzoni (May), the killing of Emmett Till, a black teenager visiting from Chicago (August), and the shooting of Gus Courts (December), a civil rights associate of Lee in Belzoni. The Smith case was cited in the NAACP's pamphlet M is for Mississippi and Murder. Lack of action Three white men, Noah Smith, Mack Smith, and Charles Falvey were arrested in connection with Smith's murder. On September 13, 1955, an all- white Brookhaven grand jury failed to return any indictments. The district attorney reported that the sheriff, Carnie E. Smith, refused to make an immediate arrest \\"although he knew everything I know\\". The district attorney further reported that the sheriff told him he saw Noah Smith, one of the accused, \\"leave the scene with blood all over him. It was his duty to take that man into custody regardless of who he was, but he did not do it.\\" Noting that all three of the accused were deceased, the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division closed the civil rights case in 2016.

He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777‚Äì1778 and 1784. He signed the Articles of Confederation. His wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Ann Remington and William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was also the father-in-law of Washington Allston, a noted painter and poet. Biography Robert Field Dana family plot in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Massachusetts Francis was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the son of lawyer Richard Dana. He was educated at Harvard where he graduated in 1762, then read law and was admitted to the bar, after which he built a successful legal practice in Boston. Being an opponent of the British colonial policy, he became a leader of the Sons of Liberty, and was first elected to Massachusetts's provincial (revolutionary) Congress in 1774. In 1775 the Continental Congress dispatched him to England in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the differences leading to the Revolutionary War. He returned the following year, convinced that a friendly settlement of the dispute was impossible, and was elected a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777, where he signed the Articles of Confederation in 1778. As a member of the latter body, he became chairman in January 1778 of the committee appointed to visit Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge and confer with him concerning the reorganization of the army. This committee spent about three months in camp, and assisted Washington in preparing the plan of reorganization which Congress in the main adopted. In this year, he was also a member of a committee to consider Lord North's offer of conciliation, which he vigorously opposed. Dana left the Congress to accompany John Adams to Paris as a secretary to the diplomatic delegation.Adams had been selected as minister plenipotentiary to negotiate treaties of peace and commerce with Great Britain. In 1780 he was named as American minister to the Russian Empire, and while he never gained official recognition from Catherine the Great,Despite the good offices of the French envoy, Charles Olivier de Saint-Georges de V√©rac; Cf. he remained in St. Petersburg until 1783.

He was re-elected five more times by surprisingly wide margins in what was by far the most Democratic district in the nation to be represented by a Republican. Quinn survived in this district in large part due to the close ties he developed with organized labor, something not common with most Republicans.

Despite a close relationship with Bill Clinton, whom he considers his friend, he voted for three of the articles of impeachment against him.

Porter, considered a classic of children's literature. The book's success led to Porter soon writing a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more Pollyanna sequels, known as \\"Glad Books\\", were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith. Further sequels followed, including Pollyanna Plays the Game by Colleen L. Reece, published in 1997. Due to the book's fame, \\"Pollyanna\\" has become a byword for someone who ‚Äì like the title character ‚Äì has an unfailingly optimistic outlook; a subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle. Despite the current common use of the term to mean 'excessively cheerful', Pollyanna and her father played the glad game as a method of coping with the real difficulties and sorrows that, along with luck and joy, shape every life. Pollyanna has been adapted for film several times. Some of the best known are the 1920 version starring Mary Pickford, and Disney's 1960 version starring child actress Hayley Mills, who won a special Oscar for the role. Plot The title character is Pollyanna Whittier, an eleven-year-old orphan who goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville, Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and cold spinster Aunt Polly, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it is her duty to her late sister. Pollyanna's philosophy of life centers on what she calls \\"The Glad Game,\\" an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident one Christmas when Pollyanna, who was hoping for a doll in the missionary barrel, found only a pair of crutches inside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at the good side of things‚Äîin this case, to be glad about the crutches because she did not need to use them. With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt's dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live. The Glad Game shields her from her aunt's stern attitude: when Aunt Polly puts her in a stuffy attic room without carpets or pictures, she exults at the beautiful view from the high window; when she tries to \\"punish\\" her niece for being late to dinner by sentencing her to a meal of bread and milk in the kitchen with the servant Nancy, Pollyanna thanks her rapturously because she likes bread and milk, and she likes Nancy. Soon Pollyanna teaches some of Beldingsville's most troubled inhabitants to \\"play the game\\" as well, from a querulous invalid named Mrs. Snow to a miserly bachelor, Mr. Pendleton, who lives all alone in a cluttered mansion. Aunt Polly, too‚Äîfinding herself helpless before Pollyanna's buoyant refusal to be downcast‚Äîgradually begins to thaw, although she resists the Glad Game longer than anyone else. Eventually, however, even Pollyanna's robust optimism is put to the test when she is struck by a car and loses the use of her legs. At first she does not realize the seriousness of her situation, but her spirits plummet when she is told what happened to her. After that, she lies in bed, unable to find anything to be glad about. Then the townspeople begin calling at Aunt Polly's house, eager to let Pollyanna know how much her encouragement has improved their lives; and Pollyanna decides she can still be glad that she at least has had her legs. The novel ends with Aunt Polly marrying her former lover Dr. Chilton and Pollyanna being sent to a hospital where she learns to walk again and is able to appreciate the use of her legs far more as a result of being temporarily disabled and unable to walk well. Influence The quote \\"When you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it, you surely will\\" appears in the 1960 Disney version, where it is attributed to Abraham Lincoln. However, the original quote (\\"When you look for the bad, expecting it, you will get it\\") is actually from the book, where it appears without attribution. As a result of the novel's success, the adjective \\"Pollyannaish\\" and the noun \\"Pollyannaism\\" became popular terms for a personality type characterised by irrepressible optimism evident in the face of even the most adverse or discouraging of circumstances. It is sometimes used pejoratively, referring to someone whose optimism is excessive to the point of na√Øvet√© or refusing to accept the facts of an unfortunate situation. This pejorative use can be heard in the introduction of the 1930 George and Ira Gershwin song \\"But Not For Me\\": \\"I never want to hear from any cheerful pollyannas/who tell me fate supplies a mate/that's all bananas.\\" (performed by Judy Garland in the 1943 movie Girl Crazy)Plot Summary of Girl Crazy at the Internet Movie Database. The word \\"pollyanna\\" may also be used colloquially to denote a holiday gift exchange more typically known as Secret Santa, especially in Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. Pollyanna is still available in reprint editions. At the height of her popularity, Pollyanna was known as \\"The Glad Girl\\", and Parker Brothers even created The Glad Game, a board game. The Glad Game, a type of Parcheesi, was made and sold from 1915 to 1967 in various versions, similar to the popular UK board game Ludo. \\\\- retrieved 6 March 2015 The board game was later licensed by Parker Brothers but has been discontinued for many years.

With reference to the Theory of the Three Lives of the Child Hero, he posits that, in Pollyanna, clear oedipal tensions exist, albeit in disguised or projected forms, in the relationships between the child, her Aunt and the principal male adult characters, which are only resolved by the Aunt marrying Dr. Chilton at the end of the story. He calls Pollyanna 'a complex novel replete with disguises' and sees Pollyanna, not as a na√Øve child but, rather, as a gifted individual with the ability to direct her extreme optimism and good-naturedness (for the good) towards the manipulating of the negative, worldly, cynical or disillusioned emotions of the adults that inhabit her life.Audacious Kids: Coming of Age in America's Classic Children's Books pub.

Glad Clubs may have been simply a means to popularize The Glad Game as a method for coping with the vicissitudes of life such as loss, disappointment, and distress. Nevertheless, at least one \\"glad club\\" existed as recently as 2008, in Denver, Colorado. Pollyanna statue in front of the public library in Littleton, New Hampshire In 2002 the citizens of Littleton, New Hampshire unveiled a bronze statue in honor of Eleanor H. Porter, author of the Pollyanna books and one of the town's most famous residents. The statue depicts a smiling Pollyanna, arms flung wide in greeting. Littleton also hosts a festival known as \\"The Official Pollyanna Glad Day\\" every summer. The celebrated American science fiction writer Ray Bradbury described himself as \\"Janus, the two-faced god who is half Pollyanna and half Cassandra, warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past‚Äîa combination of both\\". In a 1973 State of the Union message to Congress Richard M. Nixon wrote, \\"I believe there is always a sensible middle ground between the Cassandras and the Pollyannas. We must take our stand upon that ground.\\" Richard M.

The song is a reference to the novel; a lyrical version produced and released on a soundtrack CD reinforces the reference in the lyrics.

A critic at the time wrote that: \\"Mrs. Cushing has slashed and sliced and revised and twisted the story of Pollyanna and her infectious gladness until it has become swift- moving, intensely dramatic and very real.\\" In 1918 and 1919 the play toured the U.S. and Canada with 19-year-old Viola Harper (nee Harpman) in the title role. =1920 film= The 1920 American silent melodrama/comedy film Pollyana starred Mary Pickford and was directed by Paul Powell. It was Pickford's first motion picture for United Artists. It became a major success and would be regarded as one of Pickford's most defining pictures. The film grossed $1.1 million (approximately $ today). =1960 film= A Walt Disney film, Pollyanna, was released in 1960, starring English actress Hayley Mills in the title role (which made her a Hollywood star and led to a Disney contract). The 1960 film was shot at the McDonald Mansion (aka Mableton Mansion) on McDonald Avenue in what was then the small town of Santa Rosa, California. The Pendergast castle was filmed at Stags‚Äô Leap Winery. It was directed by David Swift. The film was a major hit for the Disney Studios. It also marked the last film appearance of Hollywood actor Adolphe Menjou, who played the hermit- like Mr. Pendergast, who is eventually brought out of his shell by Pollyanna and her friend Jimmy. The film was not very faithful to the novel. One marked difference from the book (and the 1920 silent version with Mary Pickford) was the treatment of Pollyanna's accident. Originally, she is paralyzed when she is hit by a car, while in the Disney film, the accident occurs because she is sneaking home from a local festival she has been forbidden to attend, and falls when she tries to re-enter her room by climbing the tree outside her bedroom window. The characters have been altered; in the book Aunt Polly does not run the town (named \\"Harrington\\" in the movie and \\"Beldingsville\\" in the book) and is hardly as ruthless or controlling. The idea of the orphanage and the bazaar with Dr. Chilton and the townsfolk opposing the charity of the rich are not found in the novel. The movie gives Jimmy Bean a far bigger role than the book does. Mr. Pendergast (Mr. Pendleton in the book) also has a more prominent role. The ending has been altered slightly: it is never made clear whether or not she is able to walk again (unlike the original book, the film never had a sequel). =1971 film= The Turkish musical drama comedy film Hayat Sevince G√ºzel (literally: \\"Loving makes life beautiful\\"), is loosely based on Pollyanna'. The film stars Turkish actress Zeynep Degirmencioglu. The name of Pollyanna was changed to \\"Ay≈üecik\\" to cash in on Deƒüirmencioƒülu's status in Turkish pop culture with her signature and title role of Ay≈üecik in the Ay≈üecik film franchise. This was a common practice in her career as she frequently played the character Ay≈üecik in other Turkish adaptations of existing films, such as The Wizard of Oz. The plot of the film is consistent with the Disney adaptation, but certain key features are different, such as the addition of musical numbers and the absence of the prisms. This adaptation does, however, follow the Disney version by having Ay≈üecik fall from a tree (instead of being hit by a motorcar). Also, Ayse'nin Teyzesi (based on Aunt Polly) is considerably younger in this adaptation, and Ay≈üecik is about 16, whereas Pollyanna is 11 in the original novel. =1973 serial= The BBC produced a six-part TV serial in 1973 starring Colyton Grammar School pupil Elizabeth Archard as Pollyanna and Elaine Stritch as Aunt Polly. This ran in the Sunday tea-time slot, which often featured reasonably faithful adaptations of classic novels aimed at a family audience, although in this instance it did follow the Disney film (and not the original novel) by having Pollyanna injured in a fall from a tree. =1986 TV series= Nippon Animation of Japan released Ai Shoujo Pollyanna Monogatari (The Story of Pollyanna, Girl of Love), a fifty-one episode anime television series that made up the 1986 installment of the studio's World Masterpiece Theater, and had famous singer Mitsuko Horie playing the role of Pollyanna. =1989 film= There was also a modernized made-for-TV musical version made by Disney (originally airing on NBC) in mid-November 1989 with an African-American cast entitled Polly, which later had a sequel (Polly: Coming Home). =2003 film= A 2003 Carlton Television TV film version of Pollyanna starring Amanda Burton as Aunt Polly and Georgina Terry as Pollyanna is very faithful to the book, with one or two minor differences that do not affect the accuracy of the plot. It uses the original characterizations and storylines, but takes place in an English village rather than Vermont (only the scenery and accents show this‚Äîthe town is still called Beldingsville). Like the book, it ends with Aunt Polly and Dr. Chilton married and Pollyanna walking, but the scene is the actual wedding with Pollyanna back for a visit rather than a letter as in the book. =2018 telenovela= A 2018 Brazilian telenovela version of \\"Pollyanna\\" called As Aventuras de Poliana (The Adventures of Pollyanna) premiered on SBT on May 16. The telenovela stars Sophia Valverde as Poliana. It is directed by Reynaldo Boury.

Taps are sometimes used on inductors for the coupling of signals, and may not necessarily be at the half-way point, but rather, closer to one end. A common application of this is in the Hartley oscillator. Inductors with taps also permit the transformation of the amplitude of alternating current (AC) voltages for the purpose of power conversion, in which case, they are referred to as autotransformers, since there is only one winding. An example of an autotransformer is an automobile ignition coil. Potentiometer tapping provides one or more connections along the device's element, along with the usual connections at each of the two ends of the element, and the slider connection. Potentiometer taps allow for circuit functions that would otherwise not be available with the usual construction of just the two end connections and one slider connection. Volts center tapped Volts center tapped (VCT) describes the voltage output of a center tapped transformer. For example: A 24 VCT transformer will measure 24 VAC across the outer two taps (winding as a whole), and 12 VAC from each outer tap to the center-tap (half winding). These two 12 VAC supplies are 180 degrees out of phase with each other, measured with respect to the tap, thus making it easy to derive positive and negative 12 volt DC power supplies from them. *In early vacuum tube audio amplifiers, center-tapped transformers were sometimes used as the phase inverter to drive the two output tubes of a push- pull stage. The technique is nearly as old as electronic amplification and is well documented, for example, in The Radiotron Designer's Handbook, Third Edition of 1940. This technique was carried over into transistor designs also, part of the reason for which was that capacitors were large, expensive and unreliable. However, since that era, capacitors have become vastly smaller, cheaper and more reliable, whereas transformers are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, as designers acquired more experience with transistors, they stopped trying to treat them like tubes. Coupling a class A intermediate amplification stage to a class AB power stage using a transformer doesn't make sense anymore even in small systems powered from a single-voltage supply. Modern higher-end equipment is based on dual-supply designs which eliminates coupling. It is possible for an amplifier, from the input all the way to the loudspeaker, to be DC coupled without any capacitance or inductance. * In vacuum tube amplifiers, center-tapped transformers are used to couple a push-pull output stage to the speaker. This use is still relevant today because tubes and tube amplifiers continue to be produced for niche markets. *In analog telecommunications systems center-tapped transformers can be used to provide a DC path around an AC coupled amplifier for signalling purposes. *Power distribution, see 3 wire single phase. *Historically producing full-wave DC with a center-tapped transformer and two rectifiers was preferred to the full bridge rectifier when rectifier costs were higher than the extra cost of copper windings and iron laminations (a centre tap only uses half of the secondary coil per half-cycle.) They saved the cost of two diodes, and also (but less importantly) halved the voltage drop across the rectifying stage. However, now the economic case has reversed and bridge rectifiers are much more common. *Phantom power can be supplied to a condenser microphone using center tap transformers. One method, called \\"direct center tap\\" uses two center tap transformers, one at the microphone body and one at the microphone preamp. Filtered DC voltage is connected to the microphone preamp center tap, and the microphone body center tap is grounded through the cable shield. The second method uses the same center tap transformer topology at the microphone body, but at the microphone preamp, a matched pair of resistors spanning the signal lines in series creates an \\"artificial center tap\\".

Generally, upon reaching a certain age a man was required to join the local trainband in which he received periodic training for the next couple of decades. In wartime, military forces were formed by selecting men from trainbands on an individual basis and then forming them into a fighting unit. The exact derivation and usage is not clear. A nineteenth-century dictionary says, under \\"Train\\": The issue is whether the men \\"received training\\" in the modern sense, or whether they were \\"in the train\\" or retinue or were otherwise organized around a military \\"train\\" as in horse-drawn artillery. In 17th Century New England colonial militia units were usually referred to as \\"train bands\\" or, sometimes, \\"trained bands\\". Typically, each town would elect three officers to lead its train band with the ranks of captain, lieutenant and ensign. As the populations of towns varied widely, larger towns usually had more than one train band. In the middle 1600s train bands began to be referred to as companies. On December 13, 1636 the Massachusetts Militia was organized into three regiments - North, South and East. As there are National Guard units descendants of these regiments, this date is used as the \\"birthday\\" of the National Guard, despite the fact that citizen militias in the American Colonies date back to the Jamestown settlement in 1607.

After extensive research travel he was promoted to private lecturer for forensic medicine in 1789. He acquired the regular professorship in botanics and later in anatomy when Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmering resigned his office. In 1798 the university was dissolved. Ackermann became president and first professor of a newly founded special school of medicine. In 1804 he accepted a call as professor of anatomy and chirurgy at Jena, succeeding Justus Christian Loder. In the following year, he became professor of anatomy and physiology at Heidelberg. In Heidelberg, Ackermann made himself a name as founder and developer of different institutes such as the Anatomical Theatre and the polyclinic. At the end of the summer semester of 1815, Ackermann traveled to his small manor in the surroundings of R√ºdesheim, as was his wont. There he fell ill with nephritis and died soon after. Ackermann was described by his contemporaries as a very literate person, but also as a very corpulent one. Although he weighed 300 pounds (136 kg), he was said to be able to hop long distances on one leg while whistling cheerfully. Apart from his publications, the city of Heidelberg conserves a special rarity from the hands of Jacob Ackermann: the dissected skeleton of rogue chieftain Schinderhannes, well known through the novels of Carl Zuckmayer.

Ellington is from Ashington, from Morpeth and north of Newcastle upon Tyne. Ellington was the site of the last remaining operational deep coal mine in North East England. Ellington Colliery closed on 26 January 2005. It was the last deep mine in the UK to extract coal from under the sea. The name of the village is thought to derive from the Saxon meaning descendants of Ella. Today, Ellington is made up almost exclusively of private housing. It has one school, village shops, and one public house, the Plough Inn.  History  Throughout recorded history, the lands of Ellington have had many owners. The manor of Ellington was thought to belong to Adam de Periton in 1240 and later to pass by marriage to the ancient families of Vescy and Welles. The Widdrington family were known to acquire possessions in Ellington as early as the 13th century. In 1715, Lord Widdrington relinquished the manor of Ellington, along with the manors of Woodhorn, Cresswell and Newbiggin. Other lands and interests in Ellington belonging to other landowners were sold in 1750 to Adam Askew of Newcastle upon Tyne. By the early years of the 19th century, the greater part of the village was owned by the Baker-Cresswells. This situation remained until the sale of their estate in 1924 (the family, now based at nearby Bamburgh, is still - 2006 -influential in the area). Ellington is well known as being a colliery village but was a thriving community long before the opening of the Colliery, having a school, two public houses and several businesses by the mid-19th century. The Colliery, which was originally owned by the Ashington Coal Company, began production in 1911. By the time the collieries were nationalised in 1947 there were 1,381 men employed. By 1986 the number had grown to around 2,170 men producing approximately 45,000 tonnes of coal per week. Pit ponies were used in the colliery till 1994.Last Northumberland pit pony passes away The Colliery changed the face of the one time rural village, with the building of three rows of colliery houses and more shops and businesses. In 1912 a co- operative store was built on land that had once been part of the Cresswell estate, bringing more prosperity to the village. This was eventually superseded by a larger store built in the neighbouring village of Lynemouth. The colliery was used as the fictional 'Everington' mine in the Stephen Daldry film Billy Elliot. Hagg Farm, which lies to the north of the village, was bought in 1924 for ¬£8,500 by the Wood family who had been the tenants for over 300 years. The farm consisted of a house, four cottages and of land  Education  There has been a school in Ellington for 156 years;, it now offers education for children aged 3 to 11. The original school building of 1837 is now the village library. To serve the ever-growing population a new school was built in 1976; it soon proved to be too small and remodelling and extension work took place in 1986. At that time the nursery accommodation was added, which facilitated the later provision of the Early Years Unit. The school crest was designed by a pupil and features a drawing of the colliery, the beach, Alcan smelter and the school.

Gen was previously known as IEF (Information Engineering Facility), Composer by IEF, Composer, COOL:Gen, Advantage:Gen and AllFusion Gen. The toolset originally supported the information technology engineering methodology developed by Clive Finkelstein, James Martin and others in the early 1980s. Early versions supported IBM's DB2 database, 3270 'block mode' screens and generated COBOL code. In the intervening years the toolset has been expanded to support additional development techniques such as component-based development; creation of client/server and web applications and generation of C, Java and C#. In addition, other platforms are now supported such as many variants of *ix-like Operating Systems (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux) as well as Windows. Its range of supported database technologies have widened to include ORACLE, Microsoft SQL Server, ODBC, JDBC as well as the original DB2. The toolset is fully integrated - objects identified during analysis carry forward into design without redefinition. All information is stored in a repository (central encyclopedia). The encyclopedia allows for large team development - controlling access so that multiple developers may not change the same object simultaneously. Overview It was initially produced by Texas Instruments, with input from James Martin and his consultancy firm James Martin Associates, and was based on the Information Engineering Methodology (IEM). The first version was launched in 1987. IEF became popular among large government departments and public utilities. It initially supported a CICS/COBOL/DB2 target environment. However, it now supports a wider range of relational databases and operating systems. IEF was intended to shield the developer from the complexities of building complete multi-tier cross-platform applications. In 1995, Texas Instruments decided to change their marketing focus for the product. Part of this change included a new name - \\"Composer\\". By 1996, IEF had become a popular tool. However, it was criticized by some IT professionals for being too restrictive, as well as for having a high per-workstation cost ($15K USD). But it is claimed that IEF reduces development time and costs by removing complexity and allowing rapid development of large scale enterprise transaction processing systems. In 1997, Composer had another change of branding, Texas Instruments sold the Texas Instruments Software division, including the Composer rights, to Sterling Software. Sterling software changed the well known name \\"Information Engineering Facility\\" to \\"COOL:Gen\\". COOL was an acronym for \\"Common Object Oriented Language\\" - despite the fact that there was little object orientation in the product. In 2000, Sterling Software was acquired by Computer Associates (now CA). CA has rebranded the product three times to date and the product is still used widely today. Under CA, recent releases of the tool added support for the CA-Datacom DBMS, the Linux operating system, C# code generation and ASP.NET web clients. The current version is known as CA Gen - version 8 being released in May 2010, with support for customised web services, and more of the toolset being based around the Eclipse framework. There are a variety of \\"add-on\\" tools available for CA Gen, including Project Phoenix from Jumar - a collection of software tools and services focused on the modernisation and re-platforming of existing/legacy CA Gen applications to new environments,Jumar GuardIEn - a Configuration Management and Developer Productivity Suite,IET Ltd QAT Wizard, an interview style wizard that takes advantage of the meta model in Gen, products for multi-platform application reporting and XML/SOAP enabling of Gen applications.,Canam Software Labs and developer productivity tools such as Access Gen, APMConnect, QA Console and Upgrade Console from Response Systems Response Systems Recently CA GEN has released its latest version 8.5.

He currently holds the SNEP record for most weeks at No. 1. Profile Garou began playing the guitar at the age of three at the encouragement of his father (he also plays piano and trumpet). He went on to serve in the military and started a band in 1992 called the Untouchables. In 1997, he was discovered by Luc Plamondon while singing American blues tunes in a Sherbrooke bar. He was drafted by Plamondon to play the role of Quasimodo in his musical Notre- Dame de Paris, which made him a star in France. His first album Seul became the best-selling French album of 2001 and remains one of the best-selling French albums of all time, achieving 2 million sales in Europe and going three times platinum in Canada. He continued his string of hits with a live album and his sophomore effort Reviens in 2003. Sales for his third album Garou remained strong and he released his English crossover Piece of My Soul in 2008. The album debuted at No. 2 in Canada and No. 3 in France. Despite this, the album became his first album in France not to reach platinum status although it became his best-selling album in North America in seven years. His next album, Gentleman cambrioleur features cover songs in French and English and became his first album to miss the top five in France, where it modestly peaked at No. 35, staying on the charts for 17 weeks.

It is located between Lower Bebington and New Ferry, on the Wirral Peninsula. Port Sunlight was built by Lever Brothers to accommodate workers in its soap factory (now part of Unilever); work commenced in 1888. The name is derived from Lever Brothers' most popular brand of cleaning agent, Sunlight. Port Sunlight contains 900 Grade II listed buildings, and was declared a conservation area in 1978. Port Sunlight has been informally suggested for World Heritage Site (WHS) status to protect it from development and to preserve the unique character for future generations; however, it is not yet on the current UK \\"tentative list\\" for future consideration as a WHS. In the 2001 Census, its population was 1,450. History In 1887, Lever Brothers began looking for a new site on which to expand its soap-making business, which was at that time based in Warrington. The company bought of flat unused marshy land in Cheshire, south of the River Mersey. It was large enough to allow space for expansion, and had a prime location between the river and a railway line. The site became Port Sunlight, where William Lever built his works and a model village to house his employees. William Lever (who was created a baronet in December 1911, and was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as The 1st Baron Leverhulme in June 1917, and was further advanced to being The 1st Viscount Leverhulme in December 1922) personally supervised planning the village, and employed nearly thirty different architects. Between 1899 and 1914, 800 houses were built to house a population of 3,500. The garden village had allotments and public buildings including the Lady Lever Art Gallery, a cottage hospital, schools, a concert hall, open air swimming pool, church, and a temperance hotel. Lever introduced welfare schemes, and provided for the education and entertainment of his workforce, encouraging recreation and organisations which promoted art, literature, science or music. The aims of Lord Leverhulme, as he became, were \\"to socialise and Christianise business relations and get back to that close family brotherhood that existed in the good old days of hand labour.\\" He claimed that Port Sunlight was an exercise in profit sharing, but rather than share profits directly, he invested them in the village. He said, \\"It would not do you much good if you send it down your throats in the form of bottles of whisky, bags of sweets, or fat geese at Christmas. On the other hand, if you leave the money with me, I shall use it to provide for you everything that makes life pleasant ‚Äì nice houses, comfortable homes, and healthy recreation.\\" The historical significance of Port Sunlight lies in its combination of model industrial housing, providing materially decent conditions for working people, with the architectural and landscape values of the garden suburb, influenced by the ideas of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Each block of houses was designed by a different architect. The backs of any of the houses cannot be seen, and each house is unique. In terms of architectural features, there is half-timbering, carved woodwork and masonry, pargetting (ornamental plaster work) moulded and twisted chimneys and leaded glazed patterns. Some houses were built in Flemish style, with bricks imported from Belgium. Geography Port Sunlight is situated on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, at the western side of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Gayton. Port Sunlight is at an elevation of between above sea level. Community Lady Lever Art Gallery One of the great buildings in Port Sunlight is the Lady Lever Art Gallery. A keen art collector, Lever travelled all over the world and liked to show the villagers the art he collected. Opened in 1922 by Princess Beatrice, the art gallery shows Lever's collection and modern-day artwork. The collection includes a range of furniture, paintings, sculptures and ceramics. Other notable buildings include the Lyceum, the Gladstone Theatre (which hosts local amateur dramatic productions), Hesketh Hall (which housed the local branch of the Royal British Legion until 2013, when it was converted into 13 flats) and the \\"Bridge Inn\\" public house. The village contains a Christ Church, a United Reformed Church, and opposite is a small primary school. Church Drive Primary School is open to people living outside the village and residents. There is a war memorial by Goscombe John in the village centre in memory of soldiers that died in World War I. Port Sunlight has a water feature. The open air swimming pool is now a garden centre and cafe. The Cottage Hospital, opened in 1907, was closed for many years but refurbished and reopened in 2008 as the Leverhulme Hotel. Until the 1980s, all residents were employees of Unilever and their families. During this decade the houses were first sold privately. The former village school is now a working men's club. A new addition to the area is the Port Sunlight River Park, it opened to the public in 2014. It is situated on the banks of the River Mersey between Cammell Laird Ship Yard and Bromborough Docks. The River park is opposite Otterspool promenade and it offers a clear view of Liverpool's water front, visible landmarks are the Anglican Cathedral and The Albert Dock. Port Sunlight River Park is an open, natural space that has been created on the former landfill site at Bromborough Docks, the site was taken over by The Land Trust, 'a charity that is committed to the long term, sustainable management of open space for community benefit'. There are an array of walk-ways, wild flowers, wild life and a wetland area, all for the public to enjoy. It is picturesque in all seasons. Transport The area is served by both Bebington and Port Sunlight railway stations, on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. There are regular train services to Chester, Ellesmere Port and to Liverpool via Birkenhead. Cultural references Port Sunlight was widely celebrated. In 1912, it became the subject of a hit West End musical comedy, The Sunshine Girl, at the Gaiety Theatre, London. It starred Phyllis Dare, one of the most popular pin-ups of the Edwardian era, and was written by Paul Alfred Rubens. The show introduced the tango dance to British audiences. In 1919, Lever Brothers made a 40-minute-long sponsored film, Port Sunlight, to promote the town and factory. The Sunlight Cottages in Glasgow are rare surviving relics from the series of Great Exhibitions held in Kelvingrove Park in 1888, 1901 and 1911. These rambling, asymmetrical cottages were constructed in 1901 as replicas of two of the Port Sunlight houses. Designed in an idealised Elizabethan half-timbered style by Exhibition architect James Miller, the houses are picturesquely sited high above the Kelvin.

He was a hero of the Battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743), in Bavaria during the War of the Austrian Succession; the last time that a British monarch, in this case King George II, personally led his own country's troops into battle. Biography Little is known of his early life, save for him being a shoemaker's apprentice in Yarm, before joining the Army. Once enlisted, Brown fought as a private soldier in King's Own Regiment Dragoons (Bland's Dragoons). During this battle, he had two horses killed under him. In the thick of the action, Brown witnessed the regiment's standard falling to the ground and was captured by the French. Brown attempted to dismount his horse to recover the standard, but was struck by a blow from a sabre and lost two fingers from his left hand. His horse bolted in fright to the rear of the enemy lines, where Brown subsequently caught sight of his standard in the hands of a French trooper. Brown reclaimed the standard after killing the enemy soldier, remounted a horse, secured his regiments' standard by wedging its flagstaff between himself and the saddle, and returned to his own by galloping through the massed ranks of the enemy. During this return, Brown was further wounded by the French, receiving eight sabre cuts in his face, neck and head, and lost most of his nose as a result. Brown diced with death; two musket bullets hit his back, and three passed through his headgear, one of the latter giving Brown a cut across his forehead that went down to his right eyebrow. Returning to his own company a hero, he was applauded with 'three loud Huzzas' in recognition of his valiant bravery. After his army service, Brown retired from the 3rd Hussars, whereupon he was rewarded by King George II with a gold-topped walking stick, a replica nose made of silver to replace his he lost in battle, and a King's pension of 30 crowns (¬£30) a year. Brown moved to Yarm and opened an inn bearing his own name, where he lived out the remainder of his life. Browns' inn once contained an oil-painted sign which depicted him as the hero of the Battle of Dettingen. This sign is now lost, but a replica is located in Yarm Town Hall. Brown died in Yarm in , and is buried there in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene's Church (OS grid ref: NZ416129). His grave can still be seen and is now marked with a Portland stone replica of a Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstone, presented by the Queen's Own Hussars in 1968. Honours The Battle of Dettingen is notable for two things: it was the last time a British monarch personally led his troops into battle, and the last time a serving soldier was knighted on the battlefield. Tom Brown was knighted as a Knight Banneret by the King at the end of the battle for his actions, as noted in The London Magazine, and Monthly Chronologer as \\"the Trooper who retook the Standard from the French\\". This is believed to be the last time a sovereign conferred the title Knight Bannerets to troops on the field of battle. It is recorded that the King created sixteen Knights Bannerets on the battlefield by two sources: a diary entry by Miss Gertrude Savile, which states \\"This honour had been laid aside since James I, when Baronets were instituted\\",The Complete Peerage (1913) by George Cokayne and a news magazine published in the same year as the battle.

L. acidophilus is a homofermentative, microaerophilic species, fermenting sugars into lactic acid, and grows readily at rather low pH values (below pH 5.0) and has an optimum growth temperature of around . L. acidophilus occurs naturally in the human and animal gastrointestinal tract and mouth. Some strains of L. acidophilus may be considered to have probiotic characteristics. These strains are commercially used in many dairy products, sometimes together with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in the production of acidophilus-type yogurt, or acidophiline. Its genome has been sequenced. L. acidophilus was found to lower serum cholesterol and raise cholesterol in fecal matter when fed to pigs. These pigs were fed the same amount of food, with the same nutritional content, but one group received saline solution with L. acidophilus while the other group received just the saline. The group given the saline with the bacteria had lowered serum cholesterol compared to the control group. Pigs were chosen because their digestive system is similar to that of humans. L. acidophilus is also correlated with antagonistic actions upon growth for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Clostridium perfringens. The S. aureus, out of the four organisms, was the most affected by L. acidophilus. However, along with S. aureus , the other gram positive bacteria C. perfringens, was affected more by L. acidophilus, than the two other bacteria that are gram negative. L. acidophilus is found to also reduce oral plaque formation by Streptococcus mutans. Although some research has been done, more needs to be done to determine how strong the effect is on S. mutans, what the effect is, and how exactly the effect is executed on L. acidophilus. The research was performed in the lab, and not on animals.  Vaginal microbiota  Lactobacillus acidophilus is part of the vaginal microbiota along with other species in the genus including Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners. In lab experiments, L. acidophilus seemed to decrease Candida albicans‚Äô ability to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells; however, L. acidophilus‚Äô role in preventing yeast infections is unclear because this species of Lactobacilli has also been found not to have a very strong ability to adhere to (and thereby colonize) the vaginal cells.Can Yogurt Prevent Yeast Infections?. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. 28 February 2012. Retrieved 28 February 2012.  Side effects  Although probiotics are generally safe, when they are used by oral administration there is a small risk of passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood stream (bacteremia), which can cause adverse health consequences. Some people, such as those with a compromised immune system, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, cardiac valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events.  Therapeutic applications  Lactobacillus acidophilus, like many probiotic supplements, have many claims made of health benefits when consumed, generally by improving or restoring the gut flora. Probiotics are considered generally safe to consume, but may cause bacteria-host interactions and unwanted side effects in rare cases.

Rebadged variants were marketed in North America as the Conquest under the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth brands. The Starion is one of the first modern Japanese turbocharged performance automobiles with electronic fuel injection, following the earlier Isuzu 117 Coupe. Overview Mitsubishi began marketing the Starion in 1982, during a period in which a number of Japanese grand tourer (GT) sports cars were available, including the Nissan Z cars, Mazda RX-7, Toyota Supra and to a lesser extent, the Honda Prelude, Isuzu Piazza and Subaru XT. The Starion was marketed in the US under Mitsubishi as the Starion and badge engineered variants of were marketed as the Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler Conquest. In the UK it was sold as the Colt Starion. Manufactured in two body configurations; a narrowbody and widebody, the narrower style complied with Japanese exterior dimension regulations taxing larger vehicles and engine displacement exceeding 2,000cc. Only the narrowbody was offered through the 1985.5 model year. The introduction of the widebody also split the car into two ranges: a non-intercooled lower- horsepower car using the narrow body style and a high-performance intercooled widebody. In most markets, widebody cars were given the label of Starion ESI-r or Conquest TSi. Markets that never received the widebody had the ESI-r label, these cars had similar performance as the widebodies. Widebody cars were offered in 1986-1989 model years in the US. Name Mitsubishi says \\"Starion\\" is a contraction of \\"Star of Arion\\"  and refers to both a star and the mythical horse, Arion. Several sources attribute the name to struggles by Japanese engineers to pronounce the word stallion. Automotive journalist Paul Niedermeyer noted that an early Japanese television commercial for the Starion closed with a logo of a stallion's head with the word \\"Starion\\" below it. The translation of the voiceover says the name refers to a star and the mythical horse, Arion. The Mitsubishi Colt and Mitsubishi Eclipse featured equine names, with the Eclipse named after the champion racehorse. Marketing material from 1982 somewhat confirms the official explanation. On an episode of BBC\`s Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson says the name was supposed to be stallion however it was misunderstood as \\"Starion\\" in a phone call with the marketing team and the name stuck since then. Design Rear view of earlier, narrow-bodied Starion A Mitsubishi Starion Turbo The Starion uses a traditional front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout. Many came with a limited slip differential and anti-lock brakes (single channel, rear wheels only) as standard features. The entire chassis was derived from the previous high-performance variant of the Mitsubishi Sapporo or Mitsubishi Galant Lambda sports coupe, with a MacPherson strut suspension and sway bars that were fitted to the front and rear. Rack and pinion steering was not offered, instead gearbox steering was standard on all models. Engine capacity differed between markets. American customers received the larger SOHC Astron G54B 2.6 L engine. Most markets received the SOHC 2.0 L Sirius G63B engine, subsequently featured in DOHC form in later Mitsubishi sport compacts such as the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Both the 2.0 L and the 2.6 L produced roughly the same horsepower, the larger 2.6 L did have a slight torque advantage and the 2.0L had a higher redline. Reporters of the time considered the 2.0l to be peaky and exciting, while the American market 2.6l had plenty of torque, but was less rewarding. Both engines featured computer-controlled fuel injection and turbocharging. After 1987, European Starion models were also fitted with the 2.6 L engine, as was the GSR-VR for Japan. The move to the 2.6 L in all markets was spurred by emissions restrictions around the world tightening to meet the American standards for lead in fuels. Reviews during the change were negative as many felt the car was slower, for most of these markets this was the case as the engine change also coincided with a move to the heavier body style. From 1984 until 1987 in Japan a 12-valve (two intake, one exhaust) SOHC intercooled version of the 2.0 L G63B was made available in the top-spec GSR-V (and some GSR-VR) trim grade Starions. This setup was known as the Dual Action Super Head (or DASH for short) due to its ability to activate the third intake valve above a certain RPM, thereby increasing top end response, flow and overall engine performance. Redline was increased to 7000 rpm on these models. Horsepower varied between depending mostly upon the turbocharger that was fitted, the presence of an intercooler, and whether the 8-valve or 12-valve head was used. A naturally aspirated version known as the GX was offered in the Japanese market, with production ending in 1983. The Starion GX was offered without power windows, air conditioning, independent rear suspension, fuel injection or power-assisted steering. Seating was a 2+2 with rear seats unsuitable for large adults. The front seats were adjustable for lumbar, angle, knee support, position and featured variable-angle side-braces. Front seat belts were located in the doors for the driver and front passenger. 1987 and later American models featured electrically operated seat belts. Newer models also featured power windows that remained powered up to 30 seconds after the engine was turned off. A five-speed manual transmission was standard in most models, however, an automatic transmission was sold as an option in some markets. Later upgrades to the model included an intercooler, five-lug wheels replacing the four-bolt wheels it had shared with the rear wheel drive Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, rear power train changes from four- to six-bolt axles, various fuel management upgrades and upgrades to the transmission. Towards the end of the models US run a widebody could be bought with a \\"Sports Handling Package\\" or SHP. This included adjustable front and rear struts and 1 inch wider wheels (up from 16 x 7 to 8\\" front and 16 x 8 to 9\\" rear). The SHP was only offered during the '88 and '89 model years. The package can be retro fitted to earlier pre-widebody cars. The drag coefficient was around 0.32, superior to the Mazda RX-7 and the Nissan 300ZX upon its release. Notable upgrades included multi-port injection (MPI) consisting of standalone engine management (programmable computers) to control individual fuel injectors, one per cylinder versus the stock PCI-ECM two injector system. Two injector systems, primary (idle injector) and secondary (boost injector) non-sequential firing ('83-'86) and sequential firing ('87-'89).

Motorsports The Starion was a prominent competitor in motorsports up to International level during the 1980s and performed well on the circuit in Group A and Group N races of the era. Andy McLennan driving a Simmons Drums sponsored Starion was very successful, picking up many race wins and a Monroe championship, this against the semi works car of Colin Blower. In the Netherlands, John Hugenholtz won the over 2L class in the Dutch Championship, with the Colin Blower-prepared Mitsubishi Dealers car. In the United States, the Starion became best known for successes in endurance racing. Starions from Dave Wolin's Team Mitsubishi, with turbocharged 2.6 L G54B engines built by noted Lotus engine guru Dave Vegher, captured the prestigious \\"Longest Day of Nelson Ledges\\" 24-hour endurance race four years running from 1984 through 1987. Team Mitsubishi Starions also won the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) U.S. Endurance Championships three of those four years, competing against the fully factory-backed (Wolin's team was only partially sponsored by Mitsubishi) efforts from Chrysler, Audi, Nissan and Mazda. Although not commonly seen in modern motorsports, a number are still raced on both circuit and in special stage rally events, usually by privateers. =Starion 4WD= Group B The Starion was not very successful off-road, but found victory in Group A World Rally Championships and Asia Pacific Rally Championships during 1987 and 1988. An all wheel drive version of the Starion was also produced for Group B specifications (one of the few Japanese automobile manufacturers to enter this class), but after an encouraging start as a prototype, it was not homologated before the FIA banned Group B cars for safety reasons. The Starion was converted to all wheel drive by adding a strengthened transfer case from a Pajero behind the transmission. This configuration allowed the engine to be situated well back in the chassis, for improved front/rear weight distribution compared to the Audi Quattro, whose configuration required the engine to be far forward in the car. Although the wheelbase did not change, the use of regular headlights rather than the production model's pop-up headlights allowed the nose to be six inches shorter, as well as saving several pounds in weight. Further weight was saved by the use of carbon fiber for the driveshafts, sumpguard, and lower arms of the suspension, and fiberglass for the hood (bonnet), tailgate, door skins, fenders, bumpers and spoilers, resulting in a final weight of less than , lighter than the Audi Quattro. The car was developed with a turbocharged and intercooled version of Mitsubishi's 2.0 L fuel injected engine, but the final goal was to use a turbocharged and intercooled version of the Sirius Dash engine that Mitsubishi announced at the 1983 Tokyo Motor Show, which switched electronically at 2500 rpm from one inlet valve per cylinder to two. The car was campaigned for Mitsubishi by Team Ralliart in Essex, Great Britain, under rally veteran Andrew Cowan and engineer Alan Wilkinson, who had developed the Audi Quattro for Audi Sport UK. =Major results circuit= Team Mitsubishi Starion winning the 1985 Longest Day of Nelson Ledges, 24-hour race, despite heavy rollover crash damage (Note the chicken wire \\"windshield\\"). 1987 Escort Endurance Series Championship- winning Team Mitsubishi Starion ESI-R.

Nomex is a flame- resistant meta-aramid material developed in the early 1960s by DuPont and first marketed in 1967.Stephanie Kwolek, Hiroshi Mera, Tadahiko Takata ‚ÄúHigh- Performance Fibers‚Äù in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  Properties  Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is an example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex strands cannot align during filament polymerization and has less strength: its ultimate tensile strength is 340MPa.http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet_print.aspx?matguid=708a229bb73441b9a9ebc38ad3e44725 However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.  Production  Nomex is produced by condensation reaction from the monomers m-phenylenediamine and isophthaloyl chloride. It is sold in both fiber and sheet forms and is used as a fabric where resistance from heat and flame is required. Nomex sheet is actually a calendered paper and made in a similar fashion. Nomex Type 410 paper was the first Nomex paper developed and one of the higher volume grades made, mostly for electrical insulation purposes. Nomex fiber is made in the United States. Wilfred Sweeny (1926‚Äì2011), the DuPont scientist responsible for discoveries leading to Nomex, earned a DuPont Lavoisier Medal in 2002 partly for this work.  Applications  Nomex Paper is used in electrical laminates such as circuit boards and transformer cores as well as fireproof honeycomb structures where it is saturated with a phenolic resin. Honeycomb structures such as these, as well as mylar-Nomex laminates, are used extensively in aircraft construction. Firefighting, military aviation, and vehicle racing industries use Nomex to create clothing and equipment that can withstand intense heat. A Nomex hood is a common piece of racing and firefighting equipment. It is placed on the head on top of a firefighter's face mask. The hood protects the portions of the head not covered by the helmet and face mask from the intense heat of the fire. Wildland firefighters wear Nomex shirts and trousers as part of their personal protective equipment during wildfire suppression activities. Racing car drivers wear driving suits constructed of Nomex and or other fire retardant materials, along with Nomex gloves, long underwear, balaclavas, socks, helmet lining and shoes, to protect them in the event of a fire. Military pilots and aircrew wear flight suits made of over 92 percent Nomex to protect them from the possibility of cockpit fires and other mishaps. Troops riding in ground vehicles often wear Nomex. Kevlar thread is often used to hold the fabric together at seams. Military tank drivers also typically use Nomex hoods as protection against fire.Intense Battles Call for Intense Flash Fire Protection In the U.S. space program, Nomex has been used for the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment on the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (in conjunction with Kevlar and Gore-Tex) and ACES pressure suit, both for fire and extreme environment (water immersion to near vacuum) protection, and as thermal blankets on the payload bay doors, fuselage, and upper wing surfaces of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. It has also been used for the airbags for the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions , the Galileo atmospheric probe, the Cassini-Huygens Titan probe, as an external covering on the AERCam Sprint, and is planned to be incorporated into NASA's upcoming Crew Exploration Vehicle. Nomex has been used as an acoustic material in Troy, NY, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) main concert hall. A ceiling canopy of Nomex reflects high and mid frequency sound, providing reverberation, while letting lower frequency sound partially pass through the canopy.Immersive Art: Surrounded by Science, Art Flourishes by Michael Eddy, Stage Directions, February 1, 2009 According to RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson, EMPAC is the first venue in the world to use Nomex as an architectural material for acoustic reasons. Nomex (like Kevlar) is also used in the production of loudspeaker drivers. Honeycomb- structured Nomex paper is used as a spacer between layers of lead in the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter, and as a laminate core for hull and deck construction in custom boats.Boat Building: Process and Advances, How Core Materials Make Better Boats by Eric W. Sponberg, Naval Architect Nomex is used in industrial applications as a filter in exhaust filtration systems, typically a baghouse, that deal with hot gas emissions found in asphalt plants, cement plants, steel smelting facilities, and non-ferrous metal production facilities. http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics- fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/uses-and-applications/hot-gas- filtration.html Nomex is used in some classical guitar soundboards in order to create a \\"composite\\" top. Nomex's rigidity and low density helps create a clear and loud sound when laminated between cedar and spruce 'skins'. While the 'laminated' technique was created by Matthais Dammann, the use of Nomex within was first employed by luthier Gernot Wagner.  History  The deaths in fiery crashes of race car drivers Fireball Roberts at Charlotte, and Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald at Indianapolis in 1964, led to the use of flame- resistant fabrics such as Nomex.Competition Press, June 27-July 10, 1964, Page 2. In early 1966 Competition Press and Autoweek reported: \\"During the past season, experimental driving suits were worn by Walt Hansgen, Masten Gregory, Marvin Panch and Group 44's Bob Tullius; these four representing a fairly good cross section in the sport. The goal was to get use-test information on the comfort and laundering characteristics of Nomex. The Chrysler-Plymouth team at the recent Motor Trend 500 at Riverside also wore these suits.\\"Competition Press and Autoweek, April 9, 1966, Page 17.

Retrieved November 8, 2018. It was the first Ramones album to feature new drummer Marky Ramone, who replaced Tommy Ramone. Tommy left the band due to low sales of previous albums as well as stress he experienced while touring; however, he stayed with the band to produce the album with Ed Stasium. The artwork's concept was designed by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald and later modified by John Holmstrom to include Marky instead of Tommy. It features the well- known track \\"I Wanna Be Sedated.\\" The songs on Road to Ruin were considered by both fans and critics as an attempt to get the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were less prominent in punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many pointing out that the band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin peaked at 103 on the Billboard 200, over 50 places behind its predecessor, Rocket to Russia. Conception After the band's previous album Rocket to Russia saw poor album sales, drummer Tommy Ramone left his performing position to focus primarily on producing for the band. After Tommy suggested they search for a new drummer, they began looking in New York City based clubs.Leigh 2008, p. 183. While at CBGBs, Ramones bassist Dee Dee Ramone approached Marc Bell (Marky Ramone) ‚Äì who was his friend and had previously been the drummer in Richard Hell and the Voidoids ‚Äì asking him if he was interested in joining the Ramones. A month after this encounter, manager Danny Fields formally asked Marky to audition for the band. Around twenty others auditioned to be the drummer, though the Johnny, Joey and Dee Dee wanted to hire Marky after his performances of \\"I Don't Care\\" and \\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\\". Marky stayed close to Tommy's straightforward technique, with a bit more technical sophistication.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/road-to- ruin-19781102Leigh 2008, p. 184. Three weeks after Marky joined the band, the Ramones began recording Road to Ruin in Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, the premises of a former Episcopalian Church.Bowe 2010, p. 55.True 2005, p. 94. Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: \\"After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the Road to Ruin album with Marky Ramone. We rehearsed with Marky, just getting it down. Then we went into the studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. We spent a lot of money, and the entire summer, on Road to Ruin.\\" Music critic John Young of Rolling Stone called the album's production \\"clean and simple\\", but pointed out that the track \\"Bad Brain\\" contained \\"funny noises\\" suggested by the producers in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended. The artwork's concept was originated by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald, who illustrated the members performing with a lobster claw coming out of an amplifier and a snake around their feet. Following the drawing's completion, MacDonald sent it to the band and they decided to make it their Road to Ruin album cover.True 2005, p. 93. This sketch did, however, include original drummer Tommy, so the drawing had to be modified to depict Marky instead. This alteration was undergone by artist John Holmstrom, a Punk magazine associate and designer.Leigh 2008, p. 258. Lyrics and composition The album introduced some characteristics which were previously unheard of in Ramones records, such as guitar solos, acoustic rhythm guitars, and ballads. These attributes were debated on by the band's fans as well as critics, who questioned whether these changes were to expand their musical fashion or the band was simply selling out and abandoning their punk rock edge.Schinder & Schwartz 2008, p. 550. Though \\"Bad Brain\\", \\"I Wanted Everything\\", and \\"I'm Against It\\" each serves as basic punk songs to intensify the behavior of the audience, the most popular tracks on the album are the pieces which part from their initial style. \\"Bad Brain\\" would inspire the name of the pioneering hardcore band. Tommy Ramone said of the album's content: The album opens with the midtempo piece \\"I Just Want to Have Something to Do\\", which contains lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and anomie. In the song, Joey manages to rhyme \\"Second Avenue\\" with \\"chicken vindaloo\\". The next track, \\"I Wanted Everything\\", is compared to Merle Haggard's song \\"If We Make It Through December\\", being called its \\"punk counterpart\\" by Rock: A Canadian Perspective author Larry Starr.Starr; Waterman; Hodgson 2008, p. 200 \\"Questioningly\\" is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. \\"Don't Come Close\\" uses elements which can also be heard in country music, such as twang. \\"She's the One\\" suggests that the band will continue making records,Thompson 2000, p. 581. while \\"Needles and Pins\\" is a cover of The Searchers' song \\"Needles and Pins\\". Rolling Stone critic Charles Young noted that the song could have easily been a joke, but was not since Joey \\"really puts his guts into these antiquated but beautiful lyrics and pulls it off.\\"Bowe 2010, p. 57. \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" was written by Joey while in the hospital where he was treated for burns on his face and in his throat. The injury was the result of an exploding kettle full of boiling water which served to treat sinuses.True 2005, p. 100. The album concludes with \\"It's a Long Way Back\\", which was written by Dee Dee and depicts his childhood in Germany.True 2005, p. 120. Release With the band's slight change in musical style, material included on the album was intended to gain a sense of mainstream acceptance, though the band members felt that this was not achieved. Tommy relates: \\"Road to Ruin was a flop Stateside, even though it had been a very deliberate attempt to secure American radioplay.\\" The album's lack of commercial success showed for a negative impact on the members' morale, and this exasperation would continue into the band's future records and tours. On the US Billboard 200, Road to Ruin peaked at number 103, while on the UK Albums Chart it reached 32. The album also debuted at 25 on the Swedish Sverigetopplistan chart. The drive to sell more albums in the United States failed, which is evident when comparing the charting positions to Road to Ruins predecessor Rocket to Russia, which peaked at 49 on the Billboard 200. Reception Initially, the album received mixed reviews from critics. Roy Trakin of the New York Rocker called the album \\"uneven\\" and \\"sometimes lazy\\", and preferred Tommy's drumming style over Marky's, writing: \\"his light, distinctive, jazz-influenced drumming is sorely missed on Road to Ruin as Marky is of the heads-down basher school.\\" Rolling Stone critic Charles Young noted that the album is not as humorous or influential as their debut, but that the band is not at all \\"losing its grip.\\" He observes that the band modified their style because \\"dumb\\" people did not understand the music, while \\"smart\\" people did. Young also said that \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" was the album's \\"killer cut\\", comparing it to \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"Loudmouth\\", and \\"Cretin Hop\\". Critical acclaim for the album did not fully transpire until many decades after its release. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 4.5 out 5 stars, saying the album fails to \\"yield the same results as the other records.\\" He examined that their music mostly repeated past formula and that since the band was still in its prime \\"such nondescript material sounds good, but the record has neither the exuberant energy or abundant hooks.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the band was constantly \\"topping itself\\", and implied that each track on the album was very listenable except \\"Bad Brain\\", the theme of which he called \\"repetitious\\". The title of Supergrass' 2005 album Road to Rouen is a reference to Road to Ruin. The hardcore punk band Bad Brains took their name from the song Bad Brain.

It has been one of the richest families in the United States since the mid-19th century, when it founded its fortune in the gunpowder business. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it expanded its wealth through the chemical industry and the automotive industry, with substantial interests in the DuPont company, General Motors, and various other corporations. Several former du Pont family estates are open to the public as museums, gardens or parks, such as Winterthur, Nemours, Eleutherian Mills, Longwood Gardens, Gibraltar, Mt. Cuba, and Goodstay.Friends of Goodstay Gardens The family's interest in horticulture was planted in the United States by their immigrant progenitors from France and was also nourished and cultivated in later generations by avid gardeners who married into the family. As early as 1924, the du Ponts were recognized by Charles Sprague Sargent, the famed plantsman and director of Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, as \\"a family which has made the neighborhood of Wilmington, Delaware one of the chief centers of horticulture in the United States.\\"Denise Magnani, The Winterthur Garden: Henry Francis du Pont's Romance with the Land (Wilmington: Harry N. Abrams and The Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc., 1995). The family's first American estate, Eleutherian Mills, located at Hagley Museum and Library, was preserved and restored by Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield. She also helped to establish the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1949. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic causes. Two family members were the subjects of well-publicized criminal cases. John Eleuth√®re du Pont was convicted of murdering wrestling coach Dave Schultz in 1996, and Robert H. Richards IV was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter in 2009. The family is depicted in the 2014 biographical film Foxcatcher, with Steve Carell playing John Eleuth√®re du Pont and Vanessa Redgrave playing Jean du Pont, the wife of William du Pont Jr. As of 2016, the family fortune was estimated at $14.3 billion, spread across more than 3,500 living relatives. History Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a Burgundian Huguenot family, and descendant of a minor noble family on his mother's side. He and his sons, Victor Marie du Pont and √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, migrated from France in 1800 to the United States and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of American families, and one of its most successful corporations, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, initially established by √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e as a gunpowder manufacturer. In 1802, √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the Brandywine River near Wilmington, Delaware. The location (named Eleutherian Mills) provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, and close proximity to the Delaware River to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder. There were also nearby stone quarries to provide needed building materials. Over time, the Du Pont company grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up through the 1960s, and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company's stock. This and other companies run by the du Pont family employed up to 10 percent of Delaware's population at its peak. During the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between cousinsGo Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online August 1, 2003 which, at the time, was the norm for many families. The family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the Treaty of Paris and the Louisiana purchase. Both T. Coleman and Henry A. du Pont served as U.S. senators, and Pierre S. du Pont, IV served as Governor of Delaware. The family has also played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the National Trust for Historic Preservation, preserving President James Madison's home Montpelier, and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the Delaware Museum of Natural History. The Brandywine Conservancy founded by family member George Alexis Weymouth owns around of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional . In 2013, Lammot du Pont Copeland's Mt. Cuba Center contributed over $20 million to purchase land for donation to the federal government to form the First State National Historical Park. Beginning with William du Pont, Jr. and his sister, Marion duPont Scott, many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of thoroughbred racehorses, as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks, including Delaware Park and Fair Hill, MD. Spelling of the name The stylings \\"du Pont\\" and \\"Du Pont\\" are most prevalent for the family name in published, copy-edited writings. In many publications, the styling is \\"du Pont\\" when quoting an individual's full name and \\"Du Pont\\" when speaking of the family as a whole, although some individual Du Ponts have chosen to style it differently, such as Samuel Francis Du Pont. The name of the chemical company founded by the family is today styled solid as \\"DuPont\\" in the short form (but the long form is styled as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company); the stylings \\"Du Pont\\" and \\"DuPont\\" for the company's short name coexisted in the 20th century, but the latter is now consistently used in the company's branding. The solid styling \\"duPont\\" is less common, but the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children uses it, as does the duPont Registry. William S. Dutton's mid-20th-century history of the family business uses \\"Du Pont\\" both for the family mentioned generally and for the company's short name but \\"du Pont\\" in an individual's full name (for example, \\"√âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont\\", \\"Henry du Pont\\", \\"Alfred Victor du Pont\\", \\"Lammot du Pont\\"); for example, \\"when he [Lammot du Pont] went to General Henry du Pont with the proposal that the Du Ponts manufacture dynamite, he was answered by a blunt and unqualified 'No!'\\") The first page of Dutton's monograph contains the following footnote about the surname's styling (the mention of \\"Samuel Dupont\\" here refers to the 18th-century Parisian watchmaker, not to his 19th-century descendant): \\"Samuel Dupont used this form of the family name [i.e., Dupont], but beginning in 1763 his son signed himself 'Du Pont.' Later, he added 'de Nemours' to his name to prevent confusion with two other Duponts in the French Chamber of Deputies. Du Pont, in English, is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. In French, neither syllable is accented.\\" French orthographic tradition for the styling of de (or its inflected forms) as a surname particle, in either nobiliary or non-nobiliary form, is discussed at Nobiliary particle ¬ß France. In non-nobiliary form, the prevalent French styling of the name is \\"Dupont\\", and thus the choice by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to begin styling himself so during the monarchical era hints at social ambition.

It lies about two miles to the west of Bognor Regis. Governance Pagham is part of the electoral ward called Pagham and Rose Green. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 7,538. Geography The village can be divided into three contiguous neighbourhoods (merging seamlessly as one clustered village): *Pagham Beach, coastal area, developed in the early 20th century, *Pagham, the original 13th-century village *Nyetimber, originally a separate village but has now been subsumed as part of a Local Authority rationalisation and the growth of the area. Buildings and facilities Many of the original Pagham Beach dwellings are bungalows constructed from old railway carriages - most of these have been later rebuilt using sturdier construction methods. The Church of St. Thomas a'Becket is considered to be one of the finest of its type in England. Pagham is home to ale and beer pubs 'The Lamb', 'The Lion' and 'The Bear' as well as the 'Inglenook Hotel'. Landmarks The Site of Special Scientific Interest known as Pagham Harbour is to the southwest; almost one quarter of the area falls within the parish. The harbour and surrounding land is of national importance for both flora and fauna. The shingle spit is of geological interest. A Phoenix breakwater, a concrete caisson that was intended to be part of a World War II Mulberry Harbour, is visible in the bay at low tides. Sport and leisure Pagham has a Non-League football club Pagham F.C. who play at Nyetimber Lane. The village has a cricket team, who play at the cricket ground at Nyetimber Lane. Sussex County Cricket Club played two first-class matches there in the 1970s. Pagham is the home of the Pagham Pram Race which is the oldest pram race in the world. The race is run on Boxing day every year at 11am whatever the weather. Thousands of people line the streets of Pagham to watch the wacky contestants navigate the 3 mile course, drinking 3 pints of beer en route. All the money raised by the Pram Race is distributed to local good causes.

Typically, rollers are pulled by tractors or, prior to mechanisation, a team of animals such as horses or oxen. As well as for agricultural purposes, rollers are used on cricket pitches and residential lawn areas. Flatter land makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier, and rolling can help to reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil. On lawns, rolling levels the land for mowing and compacts the soil surface. Rollers may be weighted in different ways. For many uses a heavy roller is used. These may consist of one or more cylinders made of thick steel, a thinner steel cylinder filled with concrete, or a cylinder filled with water. A water-filled roller has the advantage that the water may be drained out for lighter use or for transport. In frost-prone areas a water filled roller must be drained for winter storage to avoid breakage due to the expansion for water as it turns to ice. Designs A 12-foot smooth roller comprising eight 1.5-foot segments A ridged roller comprising many segments is usually called a Cambridge roller in the United Kingdom and a cultipacker in the United States; each name originated with a manufacturer in the respective country and evolved into the regionally prevalent name for the type. A field after rolling with a Cambridge (or similar) roller =One-piece versus segmented= On tilled soil a one-piece roller has the disadvantage that when turning corners the outer end of the roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made in two or three sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed. =Smooth versus ridged= The surface of rollers may be smooth, or it may be textured to help break up soil or to groove the final surface to reduce scouring from rain. Each segment of a Cambridge roller has a rib around its edge for this purpose. The name cultipacker is often used for such ridged types, especially in the United States. Uses =Farming use= Rollers are a secondary tillage tool used for flattening land or breaking up large clumps of soil, especially after ploughing or disc harrowing. Rollers are typically pulled by tractors today. Before mechanised agriculture, a team of working animals such as horses or oxen provided the power. Animal power is still used today in some contexts, such as on Amish farms in the United States and in regions of Asia where draft oxen are still widely used. Rollers prepare optimal seedbeds by making them as flat as is practical and moderately firmed. Flatness is important at planting because it is the only practical way to control average seed planting depth without laborious hand planting of each seed; it is not practical to follow an instruction of (for example) 1-cm planting depth if the contour of the seedbed varies by 2 cm or more between adjacent spots. This is why breaking up of even small clods/lumps, and well- leveled spreading of soil, is important at planting time. Flatter land also makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier. For example, in mechanical weed control, controlling cultivator tooth depth is practical only with a decently flat soil contour, and in combining, controlling combine head height is practical only with a decently flat soil contour. Rolling is also believed to help reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil. Ganging and trailing Rollers may be ganged to increase the width of each pass/swath. Rollers may be trailed after other equipment such as ploughs, disc harrows, or mowers. =Cricket pitch use= In cricket, rollers are used to make the pitch flat and less dangerous for batsmen. Several size rollers have been used in the history of cricket, from light rollers that were used in the days of uncovered pitches and at some stages during the 1950s to make batting less easy, to the modern ‚Äúheavy roller‚Äù universally used in top-class cricket today. Regulations permit a pitch only to be rolled at the commencement of each innings or day‚Äôs play, but this has still had a massive influence on the game by eliminating the shooters that were ubiquitous on all but light soils before heavy rollers were used.‚ÄúThe Memorial Biography of Dr. W.G. Grace‚Äù Heavy rollers have sometimes been criticised for making batting too easy and for reducing the rate at which pitches dry out after rain in the cool English climate.‚ÄúNotes by the Editor‚Äù from Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanac; Sixty-Eighth Edition (1931) = Lawn use = Lawn roller Lawn rollers are designed to even out or firm up the lawn surface, especially in climates where heaving causes the lawn to be lumpy. Heaving may result when the ground freezes and thaws many times over winter. Where this occurs, gardeners are advised to give the lawn a light rolling with a lawn roller in the spring. Clay or wet soils should not be rolled as they become compacted.

Because radio waves do not travel well through good electrical conductors like salt water, submerged submarines are cut off from radio communication with their command authorities at ordinary radio frequencies. Submarines can surface and raise an antenna above the sea level, then use ordinary radio transmissions, however this makes them vulnerable to detection by anti-submarine warfare forces. Early submarines during World War II mostly traveled on the surface because of their limited underwater speed and endurance; they dived mainly to evade immediate threats. During the Cold War, however, nuclear-powered submarines were developed that could stay submerged for months. In the event of a nuclear war, submerged ballistic missile submarines have to be ordered quickly to launch their missiles. Transmitting messages to these submarines is an active area of research. Very low frequency (VLF) radio waves can penetrate seawater a few hundred feet, and many navies use powerful shore VLF transmitters for submarine communications. A few nations have built transmitters which use extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves, which can penetrate seawater to reach submarines at operating depths, but these require huge antennas. Other techniques that have been used include sonar and blue lasers.  Acoustic transmission  Sound travels far in water, and underwater loudspeakers and hydrophones can cover quite a gap. Apparently, both the American (SOSUS) and the Russian navies have placed sonic communication equipment in the seabed of areas frequently traveled by their submarines and connected it by underwater communications cables to their land stations. If a submarine hides near such a device, it can stay in contact with its headquarters. An underwater telephone sometimes called Gertrude is also used to communicate with submersibles.  Very low frequency  VLF radio waves (3-30 kHz) can penetrate seawater to a few tens of meters and a submarine at shallow depth can use them to communicate. A deeper vessel can use a buoy equipped with an antenna on a long cable. The buoy rises to a few meters below the surface, and may be small enough to remain undetected by enemy sonar and radar. However these depth requirements restrict submarines to short reception periods, and antisubmarine warfare technology may be capable of detecting the sub or antenna buoy at these shallow depths. Natural background noise increases as frequency decreases, so a lot of radiated power is required to overcome it. Worse, small antennas (relative to a wavelength) are inherently inefficient. This implies high transmitter powers and very large antennas covering square kilometers. This precludes submarines from transmitting VLF, but a relatively simple antenna (usually a long trailing wire) will suffice for reception. I.e., VLF is always one-way, from land to boat. If two-way communication is needed, the boat must ascend nearer to the surface and raise an antenna mast to communicate on higher frequencies, usually HF and above. Because of the narrow bandwidths available, voice transmission is impossible; only slow data is supported. VLF data transmission rates are around 300 bit/s, so data compression is essential. Only a few countries operate VLF facilities for communicating with their submarines: Norway, United States, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Pakistan, and India.  Extremely low frequency  ELF facility. Electromagnetic waves in the ELF and SLF frequency ranges (3-300 Hz) can penetrate seawater to depths of hundreds of meters, allowing signals to be sent to submarines at their operating depths. Building an ELF transmitter is a formidable challenge, as they have to work at incredibly long wavelengths: The U.S. Navy's Project ELF system, which was a variant of a larger system proposed under codename Project Sanguine, operated at 76 Hertz, the Soviet/Russian system (called ZEVS) at 82 Hertz. The latter corresponds to a wavelength of 3,656.0 kilometres. That is more than a quarter of the Earth's diameter. Obviously, the usual half-wavelength dipole antenna cannot be feasibly constructed. Instead, someone who wishes to construct such a facility has to find an area with very low ground conductivity (a requirement opposite to usual radio transmitter sites), bury two huge electrodes in the ground at different sites, and then feed lines to them from a station in the middle, in the form of wires on poles. Although other separations are possible, the distance used by the ZEVS transmitter located near Murmansk is . As the ground conductivity is poor, the current between the electrodes will penetrate deep into the Earth, essentially using a large part of the globe as an antenna. The antenna length in Republic, Michigan, was approximately . The antenna is very inefficient. To drive it, a dedicated power plant seems to be required, although the power emitted as radiation is only a few watts. Its transmission can be received virtually anywhere. A station in Antarctica at 78¬∞ S 167¬∞ W detected transmission when the Soviet Navy put their ZEVS antenna into operation. Owing to the technical difficulty of building an ELF transmitter, the U.S., China,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25728/chinas-new-york- city-sized-earthquake-warning-system-sounds-more-like-way-to-talk-to-subs Russia, and India are the only nations known to have constructed ELF communication facilities. Until it was dismantled in late September 2004, the American Seafarer, later called Project ELF system (76 Hz), consisted of two antennas, located at Clam Lake, Wisconsin (since 1977), and at Republic, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula (since 1980). The Russian antenna (ZEVS, 82 Hz) is installed at the Kola Peninsula near Murmansk. It was noticed in the West in the early 1990s. The Indian Navy has an operational VLF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines.http://www.janes.com/article/11147/india- makes-headway-with-elf-site-construction China on the other hand has recently constructed the world's largest ELF facility roughly the size of New York City in order to communicate with its submarine forces without them having to surface.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25728/chinas-new-york-city- sized-earthquake-warning-system-sounds-more-like-way-to-talk-to-subs = ELF transmissions = The coding used for U.S. military ELF transmissions employed a Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction code using 64 symbols, each represented by a very long pseudo-random sequence. The entire transmission was then encrypted. The advantages of such a technique are that by correlating multiple transmissions, a message could be completed even with very low signal-to-noise ratios, and because only a very few pseudo-random sequences represented actual message characters, there was a very high probability that if a message was successfully received, it was a valid message (anti-spoofing). The communication link is one-way. No submarine could have its own ELF transmitter on board, due to the sheer size of such a device. Attempts to design a transmitter which can be immersed in the sea or flown on an aircraft were soon abandoned. Owing to the limited bandwidth, information can only be transmitted very slowly, on the order of a few characters per minute (see Shannon‚Äôs coding theorem). Thus it was only ever used by the US navy to give instructions to establish another form of communication and it is reasonable to assume that the actual messages were mostly generic instructions or requests to establish a different form of two-way communication with the relevant authority.  Standard radio technology  A surfaced submarine can use ordinary radio communications. Submarines may use naval frequencies in the HF, VHF and UHF ranges (i.e. bands), and transmit information via both voice and teleprinter modulation techniques. Where available, dedicated military communications satellite systems are preferred for long distance communications, as HF may betray the location of the submarine. The US Navy's system is called Submarine Satellite Information Exchange Sub-System (SSIXS), a component of the Navy Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communications System (UHF SATCOM).  Combining acoustic and radio transmissions  A recent technology developed by a team at MIT combines acoustic signals and radar to enable submerged submarines to communicate with airplanes. An underwater transmitter uses an acoustic speaker pointed upward to the surface. The transmitter sends multichannel sound signals, which travel as pressure waves. When these waves hit the surface, they cause tiny vibrations. Above the water, a radar, in the 300 GHz range, continuously bounces a radio signal off the water surface. When the surface vibrates slightly thanks to the sound signal, the radar can detect the vibrations, completing the signal's journey from the underwater speaker to an in-air receiver. The technology is called TARF (Translational Acoustic-RF) communication since it uses a translation between acoustic and RF signals. While promising, this technology is still in its infancy and has only been successfully tested in relatively controlled environments with small, up to approximately 200 mm, surface ripples, while larger waves prevented successful data communication.  Underwater Modems  In April 2017, NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation announced the approval of JANUS, a standardized protocol to transmit digital information underwater using acoustic sound (as modems and fax machines did over analog telephone lines). Documented in STANAG 4748, it uses 900Hz to 60kHz frequencies at distances of up to . It is available for use with military and civilian, NATO and non-NATO devices; it was named after the Roman god of gateways, openings, etc.  See also  * Extremely low frequency * Ground dipole * Super low frequency * TACAMO, radio system intended to survive nuclear attack  References  External links * Radio Communications of German U-boats in WWI and WWII * About the U.S. ELF projects * ZEVS, The Russian 82 Hz ELF Transmitter By Trond Jacobsen at ALFLAB, Halden in Norway * Extremely Low Frequency Transmitter Site Clam Lake, Wisconsin, a \\"Fact File\\" published by the US Navy (PDF File) * Military Communications by Christopher H.

As a grassroots group of generally low and moderate income families, Tennesseans for Fair Taxation is allied with state public employee and schoolteacher groups, along with faith-based organizations and good government groups, in establishing a progressive, broad-based state income tax as part of a larger tax modernization package that would also repeal the food tax and reduce the sales tax. This group notes that Tennessee is shown by almost all objective measures to have one of the lowest per capita level of taxes of the fifty U.S. states but that the tax share is disproportionately placed upon poorer people. This is because the majority of state tax revenues in Tennessee are derived from a sales tax, which applies to food, clothing, furniture, car parts, and other necessities, but not private school tuition, real estate investments, attorney fees, or stocks and bonds (except for interest earned and dividends, which are taxed at 6 percent under the Hall income tax, Tennessee being the only state with this provision). In Tennessee, food for human consumption is taxed at 5.5% (This was lowered from 6 to 5.5% in January 2008) and most other items of commerce at 7%, with local jurisdictions empowered to add as much as another 2.75% to this, making the overall sales tax rate in many jurisdictions, including the major urban areas, 8.25% on food and 9.75% on other items. Argument The argument advanced by TFT is a twofold one. The first point is that Tennessee governmental services are as a whole inadequate, in large part due to an inadequate tax base and the heavy dependence on one revenue source. Because of the shift to a service-based economy, exacerbated by the growth of internet sales, the sales tax has been eroded over many years. The second is that the poor pay a share of tax that is out of proportion to their income, in that most poor people consume the entire amount of their income and are hence taxed upon all of it, whereas most wealthier people invest some or much of their income, or spend it on non-taxable items like private school tuition and accounting services, and hence are not taxed on it by the state. Therefore, the argument goes, the poor are disproportionately taxed by the existing Tennessee system. Map of Tennessee A further point made is that due to the size and shape of Tennessee, and the location of its major population centers, half of the population of the state lives within 20 miles of at least one other state and that all of the population lives no more than 65 miles from at least one other state, and that all of the surrounding states have a lower overall sales tax rate than Tennessee, meaning that many Tennesseans tend to make many purchases, especially major ones, in surrounding states, with Tennessee receiving no revenue from such transactions whatever, in essence making Tennesseans major taxpayers in surrounding states. TFT also made the point that even many affluent Tennesseans could benefit from the fact that state income taxes are deductible from for purposes of computing liability for federal income tax, whereas sales taxes (), were not. The Congress changed this in October 2004. However, since those who the sales tax impacts the most are the least likely to itemize, this recent change has little effect. Counter argument The counter-argument is made by groups such as Tennessee Tax Revolt, Inc. First, that the overall burden of taxation imposed by all levels of government, including the federal government, shows that poorer Tennesseans, like poorer Americans in general, pay a lower share of their income in taxes overall than wealthy ones. They add that the portion of food purchased by persons using food stamps, which covers at least part of their groceries, is automatically tax-exempt. Further, they argue true \\"fairness\\" is epitomized by the sales tax, which is the only tax which directly affects persons who work in the so-called underground economy which is driven by cash. Hence it represents the only tax paid by undocumented aliens, drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. Of course, people can also avoid the sales tax buy buying things under the table with cash. They further point out that Tennessee does impose a flat income tax of 6% on dividends and some interest. This income tax is paid almost entirely by more affluent Tennesseans, since the first $1250 of such income, and all such income from bank interest payments, is exempt. Goals TFT hopes to overcome the general resistance to a state income tax by showing that somewhere between two-thirds and four-fifths of all Tennessee residents would pay less tax by switching to an income-tax centered system of taxation. Their current literature suggests that the food tax could be completely repealed, the overall sales tax rate could be lowered to 5.75%, and more revenue still be generated by the state with the implementation of a modest income tax. Opponents argue that there would be no guarantee that the sales tax rates, once lowered, would not soon be raised again. In addition to its long-term work to modernize Tennessee's tax system, TFT has also worked on other initiatives that fit within its mission. Most recently, TFT has worked to close corporate tax loopholes by enacting combined reporting for business excise tax purposes. The business excise tax in Tennessee is a tax on business profits levied at 6.5% of net earnings. Tennessee currently uses separate reporting, which means each company files a separate tax return, even if that company is just a subsidiary of a larger parent company. This makes Tennessee vulnerable to a host of tax avoidance schemes such as Delaware Holding Companies and Captive REITs. Under combined reporting rules, as is used in 22 states currently, the parent company and all its related subsidiaries file a single, unified tax return, rendering the shifting of profits between affiliates meaningless, and thereby shutting down a host of tax loopholes at once.

It is within commuting distance of London via Bedford railway station. Name Bromham (Bruneham in Domesday) is probably the enclosed meadow on which the broom or the dyers' weed grew. If so, the cultivation of much more than a thousand years since the name was given, has practically eradicated these plants. Another theory as to the origin of the village's name is Bruna's homestead and was first recorded as Bruneham in the Domesday Book of 1086. Other variants including Bruham (1164‚Äì1302), Braham (1227), Bramham (1228), Brumham (1262‚Äì87), Brunham (1276‚Äì91), Brumbham (1276), Brynham (1276), Broham (1278), Bronham (1338), Broam (1360), Brounham (1361) and Burnham (1361). The modern spelling is first recorded in 1227. History The land formed part of the Barony of Bedford held by the Beauchamps. After the Battle of Evesham, in which John de Beauchamp fell fighting on the side of the barons, the manor was held for a time by Prince Edward, but afterward divided among the Beauchamp female heirs. Bromham afterward passed successively into the hands of the Mowbrays, the Latimers, the Nevilles, the Passelowes, the Wildes and the Dyves. Early in the 18th century, the manor was bought by Sir Thomas Trevor, who was afterward created Lord Trevor, and whose mother was a daughter of John Hampden, the patriot. Three of his sons succeeded to the title. One of them ‚Äì the third Lord Trevor ‚Äì married Sir Richard Steele's (Dick Steele) daughter; and another ‚Äì the fourth Lord Trevor ‚Äì inherited the Great Hampden Estate in Bucks, through his grandmother, and was created Viscount Hampden. The Trevors became connected through marriage with the Rice family (the Dynevor Rices) and at the death of the late Miss Rice Trevor the estate passed to the Wingfields.  Social  Bromham plays host to several social events through the year, Bromfest, The Duck Race and many other well organised events. Notable features It has a number of notable features including a flour watermill (Bromham Mill, now open to the public), the Church of St Owen, and a medieval bridge over the River Great Ouse that, until 1986, carried the main A428 road over the river on 26 arches. The watermill is referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086 and the Vikings navigated the Great Ouse a long time ago. The mill was extensively restored in 1980 by Warwickshire millwrights Gormley and Goodman to the extent that it was able to grind wheat for flour again for the first time that year since it ceased work in 1939. Alterations to the weir below the mill's leat shortly afterwards caused a reduction to the height of the head-race, resulting in poorer performance from the mill's impulse water-wheel. Location The parish is for the greater part enclosed in a bend in the Great Ouse, and it touches the parishes of Oakley, Biddenham, Kempston, Stagsden, Stevington and at its western point, Turvey. It is to the west of Bedford.

In 1903, a new owner, the Liberal politician Sir Edward Colebrook, later Lord Colebrooke, reconstructed the Library to an Adam design. In 1908, Lord Derby bought a lease and began more alterations, removing the colonnade and adding a third storey to both wings. He took out the original bifurcated staircase (replacing it with a less elegant single one), demolished the stables and built a Banqueting Hall with a grand ballroom above.

All captives were kidnapped by the NKVD secret service and falsely accused of various forms of 'illegal activity' against the Red Army. The show trial of 16 leaders of the Polish wartime underground movement (including the Home Army and civil authorities) convicted of \\"drawing up plans for military action against the U.S.S.R.\\", Moscow, June 1945. All of them had been invited to help organize the new \\"Polish Government of National Unity\\" in March 1945 and were subsequently captured by the NKVD. History The Government Delegate, together with most members of the Council of National Unity and the Commander- in-chief of the Armia Krajowa, were invited by Soviet general Ivan Serov (with agreement of Joseph Stalin) to a conference on their eventual entry to the Soviet-backed Provisional Government. Some historical accounts say approaches were made in February, with others saying March 1945.Malcher, G.C.

The trial took place between 18 and 21 June 1945 with foreign press and observers from the United Kingdom and United States present. The date was chosen carefully to be at the same time as a conference on the creation of the Soviet-backed Polish puppet government was organized.Prazmowska, A. (2004), p. 117.Umiastowski, R. (1946) Poland, Russia and Great Britain 1941-1945 Hollis & Carter pp. 465‚Äì471 The verdict was issued on 21 June, with most of the defendants coerced into pleading guilty by the NKVD. General Okulicki's witnesses for the defense were declared unreachable \\"owing to bad atmospheric conditions\\", and no evidence was offered during the trial. Of the sixteen defendants, twelve were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four months to ten years, while charges against the four others were dropped by the prosecution. Immediately after the arrest of all the leaders, the Polish government in exile sent a protest note to Washington and London demanding their release. At first the Soviets declared that the whole case was a bluff by the \\"Fascist Polish government\\". When they finally admitted that the leaders had been arrested (on 5 May), the American envoy of Harry S. Truman, Harry Lloyd Hopkins, was told by Joseph Stalin that \\"there is no point in linking the case of the Trial of the Sixteen with the support for the Soviet-backed government of Poland because the sentences will not be high.\\" Both British and American governments shared this view.

Aftermath In his book, Europe at War, Norman Davies described it as \\"obscene\\", that there was no official protest abroad. As a result of the trial, the Polish Secret State was deprived of most of its leaders. Its structures were soon rebuilt, but were never able to fully recover. On 6 July 1945 the United Kingdom and the USA withdrew support for the legitimate Polish government in exile,Hope, M. (2005) The Abandoned Legion Veritas p. 76 and all its agendas in Poland. Soviet and Polish Communist repressions aimed at former members of the Polish Secret State and the Armia Krajowa lasted well into the 1960s, corporal J√≥zef Franczak being killed in a shootout with paramilitary- police in 1963.

Ross Johnson, the CEO of RJR Nabisco, and Jonathan Pryce as Henry Kravis, his chief rival for the company. It also features Peter Riegert, Joanna Cassidy and Fred Dalton Thompson. The film won both the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie and the Golden Globe for Best Television Movie while James Garner won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie. FOX also aired the film later in the same year. Plot Self-made multimillionaire F. Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advance news of the likely market failure of the company's smokeless cigarette called Premier, the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company's stock price. The free-spending Johnson's bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the leveraged buyout, Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm, the Shearson Lehman Hutton division of American Express. Other bidders emerge, including Ted Forstmann and his company, Forstmann Little, after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, \\"Now I know what the 'F' in F.

In July 2020, according to American business magazine Forbes, Vagit Alekperov has an estimated net worth of USD $19.6 billion ranking him the 62nd richest person in the worldhttps://www.forbes.com/profile/vagit- alekperov/?list=rtb#2cd17a2a3a74 Retrieved July 26, 2020 Sunday and the 5th wealthiest person in Russia. Biography Alekperov was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, one of the earliest centers of the international petroleum industry. His father, who died when Vagit was a boy, worked in the oilfields all his life and inspired Alekperov to follow in his footsteps. Alekperov's father was an Azerbaijani Muslim and his mother, Russian Orthodox. Alekperov is religious, but does not define himself as either Muslim or Orthodox. He was eighteen when he landed his first job in the industry. Alekperov graduated in 1974 from Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute. As a student he also worked as a drilling operator in Kaspmorneft, a Caspian regional production company. After graduation, he continued to work there, and by 1979 he had advanced from engineer to deputy head of a production unit. He had to work in extreme conditions on oil platforms. On one occasion, an explosion on his rig threw him into the stormy Caspian sea, and he had to swim for his life. Alekperov moved to Western Siberia in 1979 and worked at Surgutneftegaz between 1979 and 1985, earning his reputation as an industry expert. He was ascending positions and by 1985 became first deputy general director of Bashneft production company. In 1987, he became general director of the newly created production company Kogalymneftegaz. In 1990, Alekperov was appointed deputy minister of the Oil and Gas Industry of the Soviet Union and became the youngest deputy energy minister in Soviet history. At that time, Alekperov promoted the establishment of vertically integrated state-owned energy companies, which would bring together the wide range of organizations in the energy sector that were, at the time, reporting to different Soviet bureaucratic institutions. As deputy minister of the oil and gas industry of the Soviet Union, Alekperov was engaged in the formation of the first vertically integrated state-owned energy company, Langepas-Uray-Kogalymneft, which was established in late 1991 as a subsidiary of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. In April 1993, Langepas-Uray- Kogalymneft became LUKoil Oil Company, with Alekperov as its president. Alekperov has remained president of LUKoil since that time. Employing more than 100,000 people, today LUKoil is among the world's most powerful oil companies, with reserves second only to ExxonMobil. LUKoil was the first Russian company to acquire an American company. In November 2000, LUKoil acquired Getty Petroleum Marketing and its 1,300 gas stations in the United States Like many other Russian oligarchs, Alekperov has also moved into banking and media. In May 2006 Alekperov was one of the two main owners of IFD Kapital Group. Alekperov is on the list of Russian \\"oligarchs\\" named in the CAATSA unclassified report to the U.S. Congress. Awards On 31 August 2020, ahead of Vagit Alekperov's 70th jubilee, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev awarded him with the \\"Dostlug\\" order for his special services rendered to the development of mutual relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation.President Ilham Aliyev awards Lukoil CEO, AzerNews, 31 August 2020, Retrieved 4 September 2020 Personal life Alekperov is married to Larisa Victorovna Alekperova and has a son Yusuf born in 1990.

A stand-alone sequel to Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the film stars Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman, with Susan Tyrrell, Kris Kristofferson, Penelope Ann Miller, and Valeria Golino also starring in supporting roles. The original music score is composed by Danny Elfman (although he also scored Pee-wee's Big Adventure, he could not use any themes from that film due to Big Top Pee-wee being produced by Paramount Pictures rather than Warner Bros.). It was released on July 7, 1988, and grossed $15 million against a $20 million dollar budget. Plot The film starts in a dream sequence. Pee-wee Herman has a dream of being a famous singer. Avoiding his fans, he makes his exit by disguising himself as Abraham Lincoln. One of the fans asks him for his autograph, but his disguise is promptly exposed. They chase after him and he flies off to his ranch. Pee-wee finally awakens from his dream that morning to work on his farm with Vance the pig (Wayne White). Later, he has lunch with his fianc√©e, school teacher Winnie Johnson (Penelope Ann Miller). Next, he races Vance to a general store owned by Mr. Ryan (Albert Henderson) to order a sandwich. There, the local Sheriff (Kenneth Tobey) warns everyone of a large storm approaching town. After the storm ends, Pee-wee emerges from his storm shelter to discover that an entire traveling circus has been blown into his backyard. Befriended by Cabrini Circus ringmaster Mace Montana (Kris Kristofferson), Pee-wee is hoping to impress Gina Piccolapupula (Valeria Golino), a trapeze artist and the circus' star attraction, thereby incurring the jealousy of his relationship with Winnie until she meets Gina's older brothers, the Piccolapupula Brothers. Gina leaves Pee-wee when she finds out about Winnie, but later returns to him when she realizes that Pee-wee actually loves her after calling off his engagement with Winnie. Pee-wee wants to join the circus, but his attempts fail. Gina then tells Pee-wee about her deceased father Papa Piccolapupula who was a famous aerialist who suffered a fall performing the Spiral of Death. Gina states that Pee-wee should try walking the tightrope in his honor. Mace comes up with a brilliant idea: to stage a three-ring spectacular saluting the American Farm. The problem is that the majority of the town's residents are elderly people who have been demanding the circus Pee-wee is helping leave town. The Sheriff and Mr. Ryan lead the elderly townspeople as the Sheriff attempts to arrest Pee-wee. The Sheriff promises to dismiss the charges if the circus leaves town. While the circus is packing, Mace tells Pee-wee they will do the circus elsewhere to prevent Pee- wee from being charged. Pee-wee saves the day when he sneaks modified cocktail weenies from his hot dog tree to the townspeople, causing them to become children once again.

Production The Paramount Pictures production was directed by Randal Kleiser and written by Paul Reubens and George McGrath. Reubens also co-produced the film with Debra Hill. Filming locations include Disney's Golden Oak Ranch in Newhall, California, USA and the auditorium at Hart High School. This was Kleiser's first movie for Paramount since 1978's Grease. Release and reception During a 1988 television special, Herman acknowledged the long hours of circus training undertaken by the film's actors and that they spent a year and a half working on the movie. He also humorously compared himself as an actor to James Cagney and Spencer Tracy and ended by saying that Big Top Pee-wee is \\"at least as good as Police Academy.\\" The film received a score 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars and (along with colleague Gene Siskel) also rated it thumbs down on their television program, stating that Pee-wee entered the real world and, comparing it to Pee-wee's Playhouse (dubbed by the duo as 'the television show') and Pee-wee's Big Adventure, claimed that 'the characters in those have absolutely no connection with reality whatsoever, and that is why they were so enduring and enjoyable'. The negative reviews reflected the action at the box office, where it grossed $15,122,324, suffering from competition with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, A Fish Called Wanda, and the re-issue of Bambi, among other summer releases.

He acquired his wealth notably through the controversial loans-for-shares program in Russia in the early to mid-1990s. He is one of the wealthiest men in Russia, with an estimated net worth of $24.7 billion, according to the 2020 Forbes The World's Billionaires list, which also ranked him the richest man in Russia. His long-term business partner was Mikhail Prokhorov until they decided to split in 2007. Subsequently, they put their mutual assets in a holding company, Folletina Trading, until their asset division was agreed upon.Potanin sued Prokhorov over office, Moscow Times, 5 May 2009 In January 2018, Potanin appeared on the US Treasury‚Äôs ‚ÄúPutin list‚Äù of 210 individuals closely associated with Russian president Vladimir Putin. In July 2018, the FBI announced that ByteGrid, a data solutions provider contracted to store Maryland State Board of Elections data, was owned by a private equity firm in which Potanin is an investor. A retroactive investigative report issued by the US Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center found no indication that the MDSBE corporate network had been compromised. The contract has since been transferred to Intelishift as a precaution.  Early life and education  Potanin was born in Moscow, in the former USSR, into a high-ranking communist family. In 1978, he attended the faculty of the International economic relations at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), which groomed students for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon graduating MGIMO in 1983, he followed in his father's footsteps and went to work for the FTO \\"Soyuzpromexport\\" with the Ministry of Foreign trade of the Soviet Union.  Career  = Beginnings (1991‚Äì1998) = During perestroika, Vladimir Potanin quit the State‚Äôs structures of Foreign trade and in 1991 created the private association Interros using his knowledge gathered at Ministry of Foreign trade and his previous professional network. In 1993, Potanin became President of United Export Import Bank. In 1995, Potanin was instrumental in the creation of the ‚Äúloans for shares‚Äù auctions that became a fundamental pillar of Russia‚Äôs post-Soviet economic reform. The auctions allowed the selling-off of Russian firms‚Äô assets at below market prices and are regarded as the founding moment of Russia's oligarchy. According to the New York Times, the auctions plan is \\"Regarded today almost universally as an act of colossal criminality.\\" From 14 August 1996 until 17 March 1997 he worked as First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Since August 1998, Potanin has held the positions of both President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Interros Company. = Norilsk Nickel = Potanin and his long-term business partner Mikhail Prokhorov acquired Norilsk Nickel in the early 1990s under the ‚Äúloans for shares‚Äù scheme, owning between them 54% of the firm. Potanin owns a 34% stake. They streamlined operations and turned Norilsk Nickel into a modern corporation.  Dispute with Mikhail Prokhorov  In 2007, Potanin split with Prokhorov, citing Prokhorov's brief detention by French police over soliciting prostitution as the reason and announced the intent to acquire Prokhorov‚Äôs Norilsk Nickel assets for a reported $1 billion. Prokhorov offered to sell his 25 percent stake for $15 billion. However, Potanin refused the deal and it never came to pass. According to a report published by investigative platform Meduza in 2016, Prokhorov turned to Valentin Yumashev, former Russian president Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff, to appeal to president Vladimir Putin. Reportedly, Putin \\"phoned Potanin in Prokhorov's presence and chewed him out, saying, 'It's dishonest to cheat on partners.'\\" Prokhorov ultimately decided to sell his 25 percent Norilsk stake to RUSAL's Oleg Deripaska instead. In March 2009, he sued former business partner Mikhail Prokhorov for $29 million over a property disagreement in Moscow.  Ownership dispute with Deripaska  In 2008, Deripaska reached an agreement with Prokhorov for the acquisition of his Norilsk Nickel stake, against Potanin‚Äôs wishes. In return, Prokhorov acquired 14 percent of RUSAL. This sparked an ownership conflict between Deripaska and Potanin that was halted in 2012, when Roman Abramovich stepped in as a peacemaker by acquiring 6.5 percent of Norilsk and thereby maintaining the balance of power between Deripaska and Potanin. The truce also barred the parties to sell or acquire new stakes. The deal made Potanin CEO of the company, as he owned roughly 30 percent of Norilsk, about 2 percent more than Deripaska. In February 2018, Potanin offered to buy 4 percent of Abramovich's stake. A provisional acquisition agreement was reached in March for Potanin to buy a 2 percent stake in Norilsk from Abramovich. The purchase is not yet officially approved, pending a court ruling in May that will decide whether the acquisition is breaching the 2012 stakeholder agreement. If the purchase is approved, Potanin would own 32.9 percent of Norilsk against Deripaska's 27.8 percent. In April, Deripaska called off the deal citing sanctions as the reason.  Environmental pollution  Throughout Potanin's tenure as CEO, Norilsk Nickel has been consistently criticized for its environmental record. The company was named as one of the biggest polluters in the Russian Arctic, and the city of Norilsk was named among the most polluted places on Earth. According to a 2013 report, Norilsk Nickel's operations \\"discharge some 500 tons of copper and nickel oxides per year and release another 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere annually\\", accounting for a life expectancy of local residents 10 years below the Russian national average. According to reports from journalists who visited the city, Norilsk is surrounded by \\"1.2 million acres of dead forest\\", or that \\"nature in a radius almost the size of Germany is dead from severe air pollution\\", depending on the source. As a result, pressure has been mounting on Potanin from Russian president Vladimir Putin to clean up Norilsk Nickel‚Äôs operations. In 2010, Putin stated that solving ecological problems in the Norilsk area must be one of the company's leadership's main tasks. In September 2016, the local Daldykan river ran red after a suspected break of a Norilsk Nickel slurry pipe released industrial waste into the water. Norilsk Nickel was subsequently fined an undisclosed amount by the (Rosprirodnadzor). During a meeting with Putin in January 2017, Potanin promised to solve environmental problems by 2023 through the modernization of capacities. Briefing Putin on Norilsk Nickel's development and performance, Potanin promised to invest $17 billion over a seven-year period on measures to modernize the company's facilities and reduce pollution from its operations.[13] Potanin said that the company planned to reduce its emissions by 75% as part of its long-term development programme through 2023.[14] In the Norilsk area, emissions were reduced by 30-35% in 2017 alone, according to company data. However, another $2 billion environmental clean-up project is supposedly still outstanding. In May 2020, a major oil spill occurred at a power plant owned by Nornickel, flooding rivers with up to 21,000 cubic metres of diesel oil, in what has been described as the second-largest oil spill in modern Russian history. = Other investments = Potanin also owns a stake in Petrovax Pharm, a pharmaceutical company.  Rosa Khutor ski resort  Potanin was inspired to develop the Rosa Khutor ski resort in the Mzymta valley near Sochi after skiing with Putin in Austria in 2003. He invested more than $2 billion into the resort after Sochi was picked for the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in 2007. He allegedly urged Vladimir Putin to approve expansion in the area to create a \\"Russian Courchevel\\", despite oppositional pressure from environmental groups who claimed it would further damage the region. Following Potanin‚Äôs complaint about a cost overrun of at least $530 million during the construction of hotels and chalets in Sochi and the Rosa Khutor ski resort (as required by the International Olympic Committee), Potanin sought compensation from the Russian government for the extra costs incurred. It was later shown that construction of the Rosa Khutor resort had resulted in a vast patch of forest being cut down, although Potanin had announced that construction would require \\"little excavation and zero logging.\\" This was strongly criticized by environmental conservation groups, such as Environmental Watch on North Caucasus. Between 2005 and 2010 Potanin invested $500,000 in starting a leopard breeding initiative in the valley. In 2015 he asked Putin to allow for permits to double the size of the ski resort, an expansion that will threaten the leopard program he contributed to.  Iran  Potanin became the first major Russian investor to acquire assets in Iran after the sanctions against the country over its missile program were lifted in 2016. Through his investment fund New Winter Capital Partners (NWCP), he bought shares of Swedish firm Pomegranate, which is a shareholder in a number of Iranian internet companies, such as Digikala, the country‚Äôs largest online retailer. The investment in Digikala was estimated to be $300 million. Cryptocurrency Potanin is a member of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), a lobby group that sent Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev a proposal for alternative cryptocurrency regulations in October 2018. = Vneshekonombank = In May 2015 Potatin was named a co-defendant in a case in which state-owned Vneshekonombank (VEB) was looking for damages for losses from the liquidation of Roskhlebprodukt, in which he indirectly owned a stake. In total, VEB sought $68 million in damages from Potanin and others.  Honorary engagements and awards  Potanin is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York. In March 2003, he took charge of the National Council on Corporate Governance (NSKU), whose main goal is to improve the legislative regulations in Russia and to introduce professional and ethical standards of corporate governance in Russian companies. The goal is to boost the reputation and investment appeal of the Russian businesses. In April 2003, Potanin was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the State Hermitage, the most renowned Russian art museum. He was a member of the Civic Chamber of Russia until 2014. In 2016, Potanin's charitable organization, the Vladimir Potanin Foundation, donated works of art to be displayed at the Centre Pompidou's exhibition of Russian and Soviet art along with another 40 donors including Vladimir Semenikhin, the Tsukanov Family Foundation and others. For his efforts, Potanin was awarded the French Legion of Honour later that year.  Personal life  Potanin's first marriage was to Natalia Potanina, with whom he has three children. In 2014, Potanin got married a second time, to Ekaterina. Potanin is fluent in Russian, English, and French. He is the owner of three luxury motor yachts built by Oceanco: * The Barbara, built in 2016. * The Nirvana, built in 2012. * The Anastasia, built in 2008. Potanin is the only Russian to have signed The Giving Pledge, with a promise to donate at least half of his wealth to charity. = Divorce proceedings with Natalia Potanina = In 2016, Natalia Potanina filed a $15 billion lawsuit claiming profits of Norilsk Nickel as well as Interros International, in what would have been the world‚Äôs largest divorce settlement. A Moscow district court rejected her claim in July 2017, arguing that the lawsuit‚Äôs limitation period had expired. The claim was preceded by a smaller claim of $7 billion in 2015, after Potanin had offered a divorce settlement including a monthly allowance of $250,000 as well as real estate in Moscow, London and New York. The claim was struck down in 2016. Natalia argued that Russian law demands that wealth accumulated during a marriage is split evenly between the divorcees.

Biography He was born at Zeulenroda, in Upper Saxony, on the 17th of February 1756.

The two relocated to G√∂ttingen where he studied, apart from medicine, the classical sciences, as a student of Christian Gottlob Heyne. Ackermann was promoted in 1775 to private lecturer at the medical faculty of Halle, where he lived for two years. Afterwards, he returned to Zeulenroda to practice medicine and physics. In 1786, he followed a call to Altdorf, where he was appointed professor of chemistry. In 1794 he accepted a position as chair of applied medicine and - at the same time - a position as the head of the local hospital for the poor. He died at the age of 45 from tuberculosis. The main focus of Ackermann's scientific works lies in his historical studies of the medical sciences during the Middle Ages.

The family is cosmopolitan, occurring in temperate and subtropical climates (mostly in the northern hemisphere), but almost unknown in the tropics. Most are herbaceous plants, but a few are shrubs and small trees. The family currently includes two groups that have been considered to be separate families: Fumariaceae and Pteridophyllaceae.  Description  The plants may be annual, biennial, or perennial. Usually herbaceous, a few species form shrubs or evergreen trees. They are lactiferous, producing latex, which may be milky or watery, coloured or plain. All parts contain a well-developed duct system (these ducts are called \\"laticifers\\"), producing a milky latex, a watery white, yellow or red juice. The simple leaves are alternate or sometimes whorled. They have petioles and are not enclosed by a sheath. The leaves are usually lobed or pinnatifid (i.e. consisting of several not entirely separate leaflets), or much divided. There are no stipules. The plants are hermaphroditic and are pollinated mostly by insects (entomophilous); flower nectaries are lacking. A few are wind pollinated (anemophilous). There is a distinct calyx and corolla, except in Macleaya where the corolla is lacking. The flowers are medium-sized or large. The terminal flowers are solitary in many species. In others the terminal inflorescence is cymose or racemose. The flowers are odourless and regular. There are many stamens, mostly 16 to 60, arranged in two separate whorls, the outer one with stamens alternating with petals, the inner one opposite, or numerous in the subfamily Papaveroideae. The gynoecium consists of a compound pistil with 2 to 100 carpels. The ovary is superior and unilocular. The ovary is either stemless (sessile) or on a short stem (stipitate). The non-fleshy fruit is usually a capsule, breaking open at maturity to release the seeds through pores (poricidal), through the partitions between the cells (septicidal), or by means of valves (valvular). The numerous seeds are small. Their nutritive tissue (endosperm) is oily and farinose. The fruit of Platystemon is a schizocarp. The basic chromosome number, x, is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, up to 2n = 84 (dodecaploidy) in species of Papaver, Argemone and Meconopsis.  Taxonomy  The APG III system (2009; unchanged from the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998) places the family in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The Papaveraceae differ from the rest of the Ranunculales in some important characteristics but they share others such as the presence of isoquinoline-derived alkaloids. Based on molecular and morphological data, the family forms a clade with the families Lardizabalaceae, Circaeasteraceae, Menispermaceae, Berberidaceae and Ranunculaceae. = Genera = The broad circumscription of Papaveraceae in the APG III system includes three taxa that have previously been separated into different families: the Papaveraceae sensu stricto, the Fumariaceae and the Pteridophyllaceae. Thus the Cronquist system of 1981 recognised the Fumariaceae as a separate family, despite their close phylogenetic relationship to the Papaveraceae sensu stricto. The three former families may be treated as subfamilies. One morphological and molecular study concluded that the former family Pteridophyllaceae has a basal position with a subsequent division into two terminal clades each containing one of the subfamilies Fumarioideae and Papaveroideae, which are clearly monophyletic. A more recent study includes the former Pteridophyllaceae in the Fumarioideae, dividing the Papaveraceae into only two subfamilies. The internal division of the Fumarioideae shown below follows Lid√©n (1993), with the exception of the placement of Pteridophyllum. The subtribes are given by the Germplasm Resources Information Network. The division of the Papaveroideae follows Hoot et al. (1997). In the latter study, the tribe Eschscholzieae would be the basal clade and sister group to the rest of the subfamily, which is divided into a different terminal clade (Chelidonieae) and into its sister group, formed by the Papavereae and Platystemoneae, whose separation is not based on the data presented by these authors. For discussions of subfamilies, see Carolan et al. (2006) and Blattner & Kadereit (1999).

In Papaveroideae, the reward is pollen as there is no nectar. The visual attractant is the petals that are usually brightly coloured and often have basal guides, sometimes the attractant can also be the androecium as the petals do not last long. Some species, mostly those from the arctic and alpine regions, reinforce their attraction with floral fragrance (for example, Papaver alpinum smells of cloves), which in the case of Romneya drugs the insects. The anthers and stigmas mature at the same time, but Bocconia is clearly protogynous, the stigmas emerge from the calyx that encloses them. Autopollination is common and in some cases (for example, Roemeria hybrida) it occurs before the bud opens (cleistogamy). The presence of an aril suggests dispersion of seeds by ants (myrmecochory), once they have been expelled by the fruit. In the case of Bocconia the seeds remain attached to the replums after the capsule's valves have fallen leaving their brilliant red or orange arils exposed, which attract birds to feed on them, facilitating their dispersal (ornithochory). Seeds that lack an aril appear to be dispersed by the wind (anemochory) for capsules that open, in the other cases they are freed when the fruit decomposes. Many Fumarioideae species have explosive fruits (ballistic), while Rupicapnos and Sarcocapnos species are chasmophytes, growing on rocks, and their fruit's peduncles and pedicels are geotropic and they lengthen so that the seeds bury into the base of the plant. The Papaveroideae typically grow in cooler and wooded areas, forming part of the undergrowth. They have adapted to arctic and alpine habitats and to arid, Mediterranean areas, many species are ruderal and segetal (growing in cornfields). Pteridophyllum grows in the undergrowth of woods of needle-leaved trees between . The Fumarioideae are basically found in open, rocky, alpine landscapes or vertical or overhanging cracks, while some species are ruderal or segetal.  Phytochemistry  Mexican prickly poppy (Argemone mexicana) Alkaloids: The isoquinolinic alkaloids present in the family are well known. They are derived from berberine, tetrahydroberberine, protopine and benzophenanthridine in Papaveroideae, and from spirobenzylisoquinoline and cularine in Fumarioideae, as well as from other groups that give them pharmacological properties: derivatives of aporphine, morphinan, pavine, isopavine, narceine and rhoeadine. Others: Other characteristic substances contained within these species include: meconic acid and chelidonic acid, as well as cyanogenic glycoside compounds derived from tyrosine: dhurrin and triglochinin; in the Fumarioideae while the Chelidonieae contain the free amino acid Œ¥-acetylornithine. Flavonoids: Iridoids and proanthocyanidins absent. Flavonols, kaempferol and/or quercetin present. Many of these plants are poisonous. The Mexican prickly poppy is poisonous if taken internally and may cause oedema and glaucoma. Even if an animal, such as a goat, should persist in grazing on this plant, not only will the animal suffer but so will those who drink its milk, because the poisons are passed along in the milk. Fossil record The fossils of the late Cretaceous poppy Palaeoaster inquirenda from the Western Interior of North America occurs from 74.5 million year old deposits in the Fruitland Formation in New Mexico to 64.5 million year old deposits in the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota. Dehiscent fruit fossils of Palaeoaster have been found at the excavation site for the well known Tyrannosaurus rex specimen BHI 3033. The seed capsule of Palaeoaster has some similarities to that of the extant poppy genus Romneya. Papaverites a fruit from the Eocene of Germany may be associated with Papaveraceae. Chesters et al. (1967) mentions Papaver pictum from the Oligocene of England.An Evolutionary Basis for Pollination Ecology by S. C. Willemstein, E. J. Brill / Leiden University Press Leiden 1987, , (pbk.)  Cultivation  California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) Himalayan blue poppy (Meconopsis betonicifolia) The family is well known for its striking flowers, with many species grown as ornamental plants, including California poppy (Eschscholtzia californica, the California state flower), the stunning blue Himalayan poppies (Meconopsis), several species of Papaver, and the wildflower bloodroot. Only two species are of economic importance for the production of opium and its derivatives for pharmaceutical use: Papaver somniferum is cultivated legally in order to obtain morphine and other opiates, and Papaver bracteatum, for thebaine. Papaver somniferum is also the source of the poppy seeds used in cooking and baking, and poppy seed oil. The illegal cultivation of poppies in Asia for the production of opium and heroin is virtually equal to the legal production in the rest of the world. Some Funarioideae have a limited use in gardening, with Lamprocapnos spectabilis (\\"bleeding heart\\"), and Pseudofumaria lutea (\\"yellow corydalis\\") commonly used. Chinese traditional medicine used the boiled and dried tubers of Corydalis yanhusuo (\\"yanhusuo\\"). Symbolism The opium poppy and corn poppy are symbols, respectively, of sleep and death. In Great Britain, Canada, the United States, and Australia the corn poppy is worn in remembrance of World War I.

As is true for most mass transit systems, much of the Boston subway and commuter rail lines were built before wheelchair access was a requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The MBTA has renovated most stations to become compliant with the ADA, and all stations built since 1990 are accessible. The MBTA also has a paratransit program, The Ride, which provides accessible vehicles to transport passengers who cannot use the fixed-route system. Much of the MBTA subway system is accessible: all Orange and Red Line stations, and all but one Blue Line station, are accessible. Most of the underground portion of the Green Line is accessible, though only some surface stops are; all but one stop on the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High-Speed Line are accessible. About three-quarters of the MBTA Commuter Rail system is accessible, including the North Station and South Station terminals. All buses (including the Silver Line) and all MBTA boat services are accessible. Subway A Type 8 low-floor LRV at Park Street, which has raised platforms All stations on the Orange Line, Blue Line, and Red Line rapid transit lines of the MBTA subway system have high level platforms level with train floors, and all are accessible except for Bowdoin station on the Blue Line. Most subway stations (except Boylston, Symphony, and Hynes Convention Center) and major surface stops on the light rail Green Line have -high platforms. These allow accessible boarding from the newer low-floor Type 8 and Type 9 vehicles, which have a built-in retractable bridge plate. Some stations have portable lifts or wooden wayside ramps for use with high-floor Type 7 vehicles; however, this boarding method is largely disused. The Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High- Speed Line runs older, high floor PCC streetcars. Wooden ramps with bridge plates are at all stations except for Valley Road, which is inaccessible because of a steep incline from street level. All subway transfer stations, and all stations that serve as major bus terminals, are accessible. Most have direct accessible transfers using elevators and short ramps, with some exceptions: *Transfers between the Red Line and the southbound Orange Line at Downtown Crossing station require use of the Winter Street Concourse and the Park Street elevator, while transfers between the southbound Red Line and northbound Orange Line require leaving fare control. A three-phase project to add additional elevators will allow direct transfers. *Harvard station has longer ramps connecting the Red Line platforms and busways to the lobby, allowing transfers without elevators. (Surface elevators connect to the lobby and the upper busway.) *A long ramp connects the lower busway at Sullivan Square station with the upper busway and the Orange Line lobby. Commuter rail Accessible \\"mini-high\\" platform at Highland station on the Needham Line , 108 out of 141 MBTA Commuter Rail stations (77%) are accessible. Six lines are entirely accessible: the Greenbush Line, Plymouth/Kingston Line, Middleborough/Lakeville Line, Fairmount Line, Providence/Stoughton Line, and Needham Line, while the other lines have a mix of accessible and non- accessible stations. All stations built or rebuilt since about 1987 are accessible; many older stations have been retrofitted and several other stations are currently being rebuilt for accessibility. Most of the non- accessible stations are located on the Fitchburg Line, Framingham/Worcester Line, and Franklin Line. Of those stations that are accessible, some only have a short elevated platform that serves one or two cars. These \\"mini-high platforms\\" are usually located at the end of the station away from Boston, allowing them to be served by the car nearest the locomotive. They represent most accessible stations on the Franklin Line, Needham Line, Framingham/Worcester Line, Fitchburg Line, Lowell Line, Haverhill Line, and Newburyport/Rockport Line, as well as several stations on the Providence/Stoughton Line and Fairmount Line. Buzzards Bay station, used for the CapeFLYER service run with MBTA trains, also has mini-high platforms. Some commuter rail stations, mostly newer stations and those in larger cities, have full-length high-level platforms that allow for accessible boarding on all cars. (The standard MBTA high-level side platform is 12 feet wide and 800 feet long, capable of fully handling a 9-car train. Some stations, including Forest Hills and Route 128, have Amtrak-style 1050-foot 12-car platforms.) The MBTA builds full-length high-level platforms at most new stations, and ultimately plans to build full-length high-level platforms at most stations except those requiring clearance for freight trains. Full-length platforms allow automatic power doors to be used, which allows passengers to board at all doors and thus speeding boarding times. High-level platforms are in place at all stations on the Greenbush Line, Kingston/Plymouth Line, and the Middleborough/Lakeville Line, as well as at stations on the Fairmount Line. Non-accessible stations at Winchester Center and Natick Center are being renovated with high-level platforms. A new accessible station at Chelsea is under construction to replace the existing non-accessible station. Blind and visually impaired Tactile strip on the edge of a Green Line platform The MBTA states that \\"Service animals are always welcome on MBTA vehicles and in MBTA stations during all hours of service. The service animal should be kept out of the aisles as much as possible and under your control at all times.\\" Some train stations have yellow detectable warning strips with truncated domes running in a two-foot (60 cm) band along the edge of the platforms. Most Red, Orange, and Blue Line stations have these tactile strips; however, many less-used Green Line surface stops and commuter rail stations lack them. Buses and trains are supposed to have either recorded announcements or driver announcements of station stops, but these announcements are sometimes muffled, inaudible, or omitted by automated systems. In the event that automated systems are not functioning properly, the vehicle driver or conductor is to announce stops over the public address system. Hearing impaired The MBTA has a TTY number for \\"T\\" information: (617) 222-5146. Many stations have TTY pay phones; the MBTA web site has a list. The MBTA says it has reviewed its web site, http://www.mbta.com, using \\"the United States Section 508 guidelines and WCAG double AA guidelines, ... and made all required accommodations to help ensure that the site is accessible by users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers or other input mechanisms.\\" History Newly-opened elevator at Park Street station in 1979 In 1975, the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board enacted its first regulations requiring accessibility of public facilities. All subsequent new rapid transit stations have been accessible. The first station to be renovated for accessibility was the Red Line level of in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven Red Line and three Orange Line stations to allow the use of six-car trains and add elevators. All new commuter rail stations have been accessible since the mid 1980s, with many existing stations renovated as well. The pace of renovations increased after the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. Only 26 of the 80 key stations were accessible by 1990; $1.6 billion in renovations raised this to 69 in 2004. Green Line service was not accessible until around 2001, when key surface stops were retrofitted with raised platforms for use with new Type 8 LRVs. In 2006, the MBTA settled a class-action lawsuit, Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA, under which the agency agreed to add redundant elevators to a number of rapid transit stations and make other accessibility improvements.

Considered one of Russia's oligarchs, he was ranked 12th in the list of the top 20 richest Russians in 1996. His bank underwent bankruptcy following the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Life Vladimir Viktorovich Vinogradov was born in 1955 in Ufa, Bashkiria. He lost his father when he was a child, and grew up in modest circumstances. He graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering. From 1979 until 1985 he worked at the Atommash factory in Volgodonsk as a construction engineer. He took a leading role in the Komsomol, the Communist Youth organisation, and was given the opportunity to continue his studies at the Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics, becoming the Soviet industrial bank Promstroibank's chief economist in 1988. In October 1988, he founded one of Russia's first wholly private commercial bank, Inkombank, also called the Moscow Innovative Commercial Bank, which eventually became Russia's largest private bank. Vinogradov joined Boris Yeltsin‚Äôs business advisory council, being one of the so called ‚Äúseven bankers‚Äù, the financial group around Yeltsin. In 1997 he was the vice president of the Association of Russian Bankers. In April 1992 Vinogradov declared his support for Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and the city government, defending them from accusations of corruption. The declaration was endorsed by other figures on the financial scene, including Vladimir Gusinsky, Leonid Nevzlin and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who formed an influential economic group known as PPI, which Vinogradov led from 1993. Although one of Yeltsin's supporters in the years after the October 1993 crisis and an adviser to the Economics Ministry, Vinogradov criticised the government in 1995 of following too rigid an economic policy and said that the conflict in Chechnya was damaging the economy. In May 1996 Inkombank, with reportedly $4 billion in assets, raised $20 million in Russia's first unsecured syndicated loan from Western banks. In November 1996 Vinogradov won a libel suit against the newspaper Kommersant and Russian TV controlled by Boris Berezovsky, who had spread rumors that Inkombank couldn't pay its interbank borrowings, and that a Central Bank inspection report implied that the bank was near collapse, a claim denied by the Central Bank. In December 1996 Vinogradov established the first American depositary receipt for a Russian bank in the US stock market, being one of the few Russian banks that adhered to US accounting standards. In February 1997 he reportedly predicted that 1,000 banks in Russia, about half the total, were going to disappear within the next five years, most of them going bankrupt. According to CBS Money Watch, Vinogradov had a reputation for openness and fair dealing as well as for making impulsive and politically unwise statements. He had some important international connections, such as London's Rothschild Bank, and US consulting firm McKinsey, which had devised a business plan for him. Inkombank also had an industrial portfolio that included a minority stake in jet-fighter maker Sukhoi and control of aluminum fabricator Samara Metallurgical. In 1995 Vinogradov acquired the Babayev chocolate factory, in Russia's first hostile stock market takeover, a deal praised for its transparency and fairness: Even after he had gained 50 per cent of the shares, he offered the same terms to minority shareholders. On the other hand, Inkombank was accused of having been infiltrated by Russian organized crime figures tied to Semion Mogilevich in 1994. In May 1998 Chase Manhattan Corp. arranged its first commercial paper program for a Russian bank with a $50 million program for Inkombank, reported to have $5.1 billion of assets. In summer 1998, during the Russian financial crisis, when the government defaulted, the bank suffered huge losses, and was granted $100 million in credit by the Russian Central Bank, but only survived temporarily. Vinogradov resigned, and two days later, on 29 October 1998, the Russian Central Bank revoked the bank's licence, explaining that ‚ÄúInkombank had taken excessive risks ahead of the August 17 devaluation and that its obligations had shrunk its asset base.‚Äù The bank was declared bankrupt on 1 February 2000. There were accusations that the management had illegally transferred funds from the bank to subsidiaries outside of Russia. Vinogradov had two daughters and one son with his wife Liudmila. He died of a stroke after a long illness in Moscow on June 29, 2008, aged 52.

It was produced and shown by RT√â in Ireland. Designed by Jan Mitchell, Bosco was voiced by Jonathan Ryan initially, in the pilot series that was broadcast, with four presenters per show, in 1979. When the show went into full-time production in 1980, with two presenters per show, Miriam Lambert took over. From the 1981 season onwards, Paula Lambert took over. Bosco's name was chosen by Helen Quinn, sister of presenter Marian Richardson.https://web.archive.org/web/20140722040604/https://www.rte.ie/tv50/essays/marianrichardson.html It ran for 386 episodes, ending production in 1987. The show was continually repeated before (and later during) The Den daily until 30 September 1996, when it was replaced by The Morbegs before officially ending on November 26, 1998. Plot The show was presented by Bosco (born 25 August), a small red-haired puppet, supposedly a five-year-old child with bright red cheeks and a really squeaky voice. Bosco and the other presenters usually spoke English, but to help young children learn Irish Bosco often peppered English speech with Irish phrases, much like the way Dora the Explorer often speaks Spanish. Bosco lived in a brightly painted wooden box (hence the name, the Irish for \\"box\\" is \\"bosca\\"), only ever wandering far from it to go on excursions to such places as Dublin Zoo or the HB Ice Cream factory. The show also had a number of other segments. There are various short animations, usually stop-motion, as part of the show. The Plonsters were plasticine critters, which are continually engaged in fights or schemes against each other. Faherty's Garden, created by David Byrne, starred the eponymous Faherty a dog, plagued by an amateur crow magician (Cornelius, who would often turn purple, much to his distress) in a series of shorts featuring stop-motion models. Freddy the Fox features a host of characters each with distinctive traits, such as Fiachra the Frog, Gregory Grainog and Sile Seilide. There was also a cartoon featuring a rather strange potato family, The McSpuds, that live in a supermarket (Savers) owned by Mr McGinty. At night, the potato children, Sheila and Seamus, run amok. The Tongue Twister Twins were also regularly featured. These animations were created by Jim Quin from Thurles, County Tipperary. The show featured arts and crafts segments which were called make and do, in the style of the BBC's children's programme Blue Peter. Another prominent part of the show was story- time and each show featured a song. Cast The roster of presenters included Paul Burton, David Byrne, Peter Fitzgerald, Mary Garrioch, Susie Kennedy, Gert Kerrigan, Marcus O'Higgins, Marian Richardson (later a current affairs and radio presenter and producer at RT√â), Jonathan Ryan, Frank Twomey (later of Bull Island), Philip Tyler, and Gr√°inne U√≠ Mhaiti√∫.

(Bob) Bennett (February 8, 1939 ‚Äì December 6, 2014) was chairman of the Ohio Republican Party (USA), and one of three Ohio representatives to the Republican National Committee, of which he had been a member for more than two decades.Robert T. Bennett Former GOP chairman Robert Bennett dies  Background  Bennett was elected chairman of the Ohio Republican Party in 1988, and remained until 2009. Following the resignation of then party chairman Kevin DeWine, Bennett resumed his position as chairman in 2012 and remained until May 2013. At the time of his election in 1988 the party held no statewide offices or legislative majorities; within a decade it had control of all three branches of the Ohio government. During his tenure, Republicans held the Ohio governor's office for 16 years, won every statewide office, held majorities in the Ohio House and Senate, won unanimous control of the Ohio Supreme Court, and won more than 63 percent of all county elective offices in the state. Bennett qualified as a Certified Public Accountant and an attorney specializing in tax and business law. He was a member of the American Bar Association, the Cleveland Bar Association, the Ohio Bar Association, and the American Society of Attorney-Certified Public Accountants, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Ohio Society of Certified Public Accountants, and the Cleveland Chapter of the Ohio CPA's American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He wrote several publications on tax law and was a guest lecturer to various professional and political organizations on the issues of state and federal tax law and campaign management. Bennett was a member of the boards of trustees and a director of Ohio business and civic organizations, including University Hospital Case Medical Center Board and Southwest General Health Center of Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections (Chairman) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, where he served as chairman of the board. Bennett resided in Cleveland, Ohio, with his wife Ruth Ann. He is survived by two adult children. He was born and raised in Columbus, where he graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas High School and received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration from the Ohio State University in December 1960. He earned his Juris Doctor Degree from Cleveland Marshall Law School of Baldwin Wallace College (now Cleveland State University).  Political Success  = A Party in Distress = Before Bennett's election as Chairman the Ohio Republican Party in 1988, Democrats ruled the roost in Ohio. With a Democratic Governor, a Democratic majority in the state legislature, and the majority of county positions being held by democrats, the Ohio GOP was on the ropes.  Death  Bennett, who had triple bypass surgery in 1996 after a mild heart attack, had been in declining health since 2012, when he was afflicted by a lingering and baffling respiratory problem that doctors finally traced to an infection he contracted during a visit to Moscow. Bennett passed on December 6, 2014 at his home in Cleveland, Ohio.

He founded the Media-Most holding company that included the NTV free-to-air channel, the newspaper Sevodnya, the radio station Echo of Moscow, and a number of magazines.  Early life and education  Gusinsky was born into a Jewish family in Moscow on 6 October 1952. In 1969, Gusinsky enrolled in Gubkin Institute of Oil and Gas, however, he did not finish his education there. He joined the USSR Army in 1973 as a Junior Sergeant in the Chemical Intelligence Troops. In 1975, after being demobilized, Gusinsky enrolled in the State Institute for the Study of Theatrical Arts (Russian: –ì–ò–¢–ò–° English: GITIS). He graduated in 1979 with his graduating diploma work on the staging of \\"Tartuffe\\" by Moli√®re, in the Tula State Dramatic Theater.  Early career  1986 * Stage Director for the Ted Turner Goodwill Games in the Kremlin Palace * Founded one of the first cooperatives following Perestroika - Cooperative \\"Metal\\" - which started to produce metal garages and later copper bracelets and other fashion jewelry in mass quantities 1988 * Founded the cooperative \\"INFEKS\\" under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the USSR, which engaged in consulting of foreign companies entering into the Russian market 1989 * Created the joint venture \\"Most\\", together with APCO (a consulting company owned by the Arnold & Porter Law Firm in Washington DC) * Gusinsky established \\"Most Bank\\", one of the first and one of the largest private retail banks in Russia. The first ATM allowing cash withdrawals in Russia was installed by Most Bank in Russia in '94. 1992 * Founded a holding company \\"Most Group\\". All of Gusinsky's business assets, totaling 42 companies, including Most Bank () and a number of construction companies, were integrated into this holding structure.  Involvement in media  1993 * Gusinsky, together with a number of leading journalists, established Sevodnya, a daily political newspaper. * In the end of ‚Äô93 Gusinsky, together with several leading TV journalists and media experts ‚Äì such as Igor Malashenko, Evgeni Kiselev and Oleg Dobrodeev ‚Äì founded the first private television channel in Russia: NTV. NTV‚Äôs main focus was independent and uncensored news and unbiased political shows, and their slogan was \\"News Is Our Profession\\". 1994 * The First Chechen War started in ‚Äô94. NTV provided independent and unbiased coverage of the war and was often critical of the Russian government, its excessive use of force against civilians and the resulting death toll. Government and pro-government supporters accused NTV and its founders of collaborating with Chechnya's anti-Russian forces. Such accusations were unfounded and never proven. * In December of ‚Äò94, the President‚Äôs Secret Service was ordered to attack Gusinsky‚Äôs offices. As a result, Gusinsky and his family had to leave Russia. Gusinsky was able to return in May of 1995, while during his absence NTV and all his other media assets continued their independent editorial policy and coverage of the war. 1996 * Gusinsky was one of the founders of the Russian Jewish Congress, and in January '96 was elected its president. * In February of ‚Äô96 in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, together with Boris Berezovsky, he organized a meeting of Russia‚Äôs most prominent businessmen. The group met to decide how to support the Presidential bid of Yeltsin and to prevent the communists from returning to power. Further, the group contacted Anatoli Chubais, the creator and advocate of Privatization, and convinced him to lead and manage Yeltsin‚Äôs presidential campaign. * The elections for the President of Russian Federation took place in the June of ‚Äô96 (first round). President Yeltsin was elected in the second round of the election (July ‚Äô96). Many international and domestic observers considered these to be the first elections in Russia to approach the western democratic standards.  Consolidation and development of media assets  1996 * Gazprom, the state owned natural gas giant, became a 30% shareholder of NTV. * A US based media investor Capital Group became a 5% shareholder in NTV and 5% shareholder in TNT - a regional network. 1997 * \\"Most Group\\" consolidated all its media assets in a new entity - \\"Media Most\\". Gusinsky resigned from his positions in \\"Most Group\\" and \\"Most Bank\\", became president of \\"Media Most\\", and focused all his efforts on the development of the media business. * The new media holding company included NTV, TNT, NTV Plus, Echo Moscow, Publishing house Seven Days, other radio stations, internet development companies, movie studios and media design companies. * \\"Media Most\\" was the largest media holding in Russia and, based on the number of viewers and readers, possibly one of the largest in Europe. Gusinsky was hailed as the \\"Rupert Murdoch\\" of Russia. * While Gusinsky never participated in privatization ‚Äì all his assets were created from scratch, in ‚Äô97 Gusinsky made his first, and last, attempt at privatization ‚Äì he bid for the privatizing of the state owned telecommunication giant Svyazinvest. The bid ended unsuccessfully for Gusinsky, and many commentators have accused Gusinsky of using his media assets to influence his bid and it resulted in a large public scandal. * In mid ‚Äò97, a banking consortium led by Credit Suisse First Boston was preparing NTV for a public offering on NASDAQ at a valuation in 1.2 - 1.4 billion US Dollars, with a large portion of the proceeds from the IPO to be used for development of the business. 1998 * The ‚Äô97 Asian Economic Crisis severely impacted the Russian economy in ‚Äô98. This led to Russia defaulting on its domestic debts and declaring a moratorium on payments to foreign creditors in August of 1998. The financial default put a stop to the NTV‚Äôs attempted IPO. * Subsequently, in order to continue \\"Media Most\\" development and in anticipation of an economic rebound following Russia's default, \\"Media Most\\" received a credit from Credit Suisse First Boston, guaranteed by Gazprom. The money was invested in \\"Media Most\\" business development. * In November ‚Äô98, \\"Media Most\\" satellite, Bonum 1, built by US Hughes Communications was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. This was the first private commercial satellite in Russia, and for the first time a US built and launched satellite was controlled from the territory of Russia. The satellite provided DTH (Direct to Home) satellite delivery services for \\"Media Most\\" NTV Plus.  Confrontation with Kremlin  1999 * An alliance that included President Yeltsin, Yeltsin's relatives, and a group of powerful businessman, publicly known as the \\"Family\\", brought in Vladimir Putin as the successor to President Yeltsin. At the same time, Gusinsky positioned himself outside of the \\"Family\\" and as a result he was accused of supporting the election of anti-Kremlin alliance of Primakov & Luzhkov. This was the beginning of the conflict between Gusinsky, the Family, and Putin. * In September of ‚Äò99 there were a number of terrorist attacks in Moscow and other cities in Russia. Several buildings were bombed and many people were killed. The Kremlin took the position that Chechen separatists were responsible for the bombings. Around the same time, a group of neighbors residing in an apartment building found a large quantity of explosives in the basement of their building, and reported it to FSB. At that time a group of independent journalist investigators exposed certain facts that connected the explosives with individuals connected with FSB. Gusinsky‚Äôs NTV decided to take an independent stance and launched an in-depth public journalistic investigation ‚Äì investigating the possibility that FSB was staging explosions in an effort to influence the upcoming elections. The fact that Gusinsky‚Äôs NTV started the investigation resulted in strong irritation in the Kremlin; in fact, Gusinsky was given an ultimatum to remove this \\"independent investigation\\" from NTV, or else face the consequences. Gusinsky refused to end the investigation. Furthermore, a number of independent commentators accused the Kremlin and Putin of organizing the explosions, prompting the new Chechen war, with the goal of increasing Putin's popularity in anticipation of elections. This was the breaking point in the relationship between Gusinsky and the Kremlin, the Family, and Yeltsin's successor Putin. * On 31 December 1999 President Yeltsin resigned, and Vladimir Putin became the acting president of Russia. 2000 * In January, Gusinsky was elected as the vice president of the World Jewish Congress. * With the Yeltsin's resignation bringing Putin to Acting Presidency, and the subsequent election in May 2000 that brought Putin to power, one of the first publicly criticized acts of new president Putin was the commencement of an investigation against Gusinsky with the goal of putting NTV under government control and effectively silencing the opposition. * In June, the Prosecutor General office launched an investigation against Gusinsky for misappropriation of funds in connection with a company \\"Russian Video\\". On 13 June he was arrested in Moscow and incarcerated into the infamous Butyrka Prison. * Shortly after his arrest, representatives of the Kremlin proposed to Gusinsky to sell \\"Media Most\\" to Gazprom-Media at a price that Gazprom-Media sets, 300 million US Dollars, in return for his freedom. Subsequently, this became known as \\"shares for freedom\\" transaction or Protocol No. 6 (–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª N.6. –î–æ–ª—è —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã) that was signed by acting Minister Lesin in his capacity as head of the Ministry of Press, Broadcasting and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation. * A public scandal ensued, and the day after Gusinsky's arrest on 14 June, US President Clinton was asked at a press conference about his thoughts on Gusinsky's arrest. Clinton replied that he did not think that people should be arrested for criticism of Kremlin. Moreover, Putin, who was visiting Spain at the time of the arrest, had to answer questions in its connection. One of Putin's answers was ‚Äì \\"I do not know anything about it, and cannot get in touch with the Prosecutor General of Russia.\\" * After three days and much public pressure, scandal, and speculation, Gusinsky was released from prison and placed under house arrest on 16 June. Several weeks later, in July, he signed an agreement selling all his media assets for 300 million US Dollars. The criminal investigation was closed, and Gusinsky immediately left Russia. From that time Gusinsky never returned to Russia. On his last drive to the Moscow airport, he was accompanied by Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader who was assassinated in February 2015 near Kremlin. * Outside of Russia, Gusinsky repudiated the deal as being executed under duress. * Shortly after Gusinsky left Russia, CEO of Gazprom Media Alfred Koch, asked the Russian Prosecutor General to launch a new investigation against Gusinsky and Media Most, alleging improper use of Gazprom's guarantees to attract credits (at that time Gazprom was a shareholder of 12.5% of Media Most and 30% of NTV). The Prosecutor General's Office asked Interpol's head office in Lyon, France to issue an international arrest warrant for Gusinsky's detention and extradition. Interpol's head office declined the Russian request, asking to clarify the reason to make sure it did not violate Interpol Charter, that forbids intervention based on political character. Eventually, Interpol firmly refused to issue any warrant of arrest for Gusinsky, and when Russian authorities appealed the refusal the Interpol headquarters firmly upheld their refusal. * On 17 November, Media Most signed a settlement agreement for Gazprom's guarantees and for current and future obligations (that were maturing in 2001). Immediately after signing the settlement agreement, Gazprom Media's Alfred Koch wrote to the Prosecutor General letting him know that the settlement agreement was successfully executed and thanking him for his assistance. Even with this settlement agreement being signed by Gusinsky under a threat of arrest and extradition, Gazprom conceded that Media Most's assets were fairly valued in excess of 1.1 billion USD. * However, ignoring the settlement agreement, and ignoring the Interpol head office's refusal to issue the international arrest warrant (due to suspected political motivations for arrest), the Russian local branch of Interpol circumvented the head office's refusal, went directly to the Spanish local branch of Interpol and requested it to detain and extradite Gusinsky. * 12 December, Gusinsky was arrested in Spain based on the Russian request. The arrest warrant was issued by Justice Balthazar Garzon. * 22 December, Justice Balthazar Garzon released Gusinsky from prison and places him under house arrest in Gusinsky's home in southern Spain. The decision to release Gusinsky was strongly criticized in Spain, and was appealed by prosecution, as it is uncommon for a foreigner facing extradition to be released and placed under house arrest.  Legal confrontation with Kremlin, and later life  2001 * In January, Gusinsky filed a case against Russia in the European Court of Human Rights for violations of his rights and freedoms. * In April, the National Court of Spain rejected the Russian Federation's request for Gusinsky's extradition. The Spanish court noted that the charges against Gusinsky were politically motivated and in fact did not even constitute a crime ‚Äì the National Court specifically stated \\"It is possible to observe in the documents furnished by [the applicant]... \\"certain noteworthy and peculiar circumstances which are unusual in the sphere of judicial claims for fraud and which, although they do not in themselves lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with an irregular claim filed for a political purpose, compel the Court to consider [the applicant's] argument as not completely without foundation as far as the facts and interferences are concerned and as not inconceivable or discountable on the basis of logical criteria and experience.\\" Gusinsky was released. * In mid April, the Russian Federation conducted raids on the offices of Media Most and NTV. * Only days after the National Court of Spain decided that charges against Gusinsky were politically motivated and not a crime, the Russian Federation commenced new criminal proceedings against Gusinsky and issued a new arrest warrant, alleging money laundering of money owed to Gazprom. Again the Russian Federation submitted the request to arrest Gusinsky in his home in Spain, but Gusinsky was not present ‚Äì he left for Israel. Several months later the National Court of Spain dismissed the Russian Federation's new request as baseless. * In July, the supervisory board of Interpol recommended to stop any further actions against Gusinsky based on Russian Federation requests. Interpol's secretary general, Ronald Noble, described the case against Gusinsky as having \\"predominantly political character\\". In August, Israel refused to extradite Gusinsky to Russia. 2002 * In May, Gusinsky started a new television project ‚Äì RTV International or RTVi, that continued what NTV International started ‚Äì providing unbiased Russian language news for Russian speakers worldwide. * In October, Gusinsky's internet news project Newsru.com, started operating on its new domain name. Prior to this, the project was operating as NTV.ru, but that domain name was given to Gazprom Media, the new owners of NTV. The design for the website was created by an internationally recognized designer: Semyon Levin. Newsru.com included a highly acclaimed internet resource ‚Äì Inopressa.ru ‚Äì that provided summaries of daily news from foreign print media translated into the Russian language. Currently, the Newsru.com website has more than 65 million page views and 7.5 million unique visitors monthly. 2003 * In August, Gusinsky was arrested in Greece on another request for extradition from the Russian Federation. Several days later he was released on bail and awaited the decision while under pledge not to depart Athens. * In September, while awaiting the Greek court's decision about his extradition, Gusinsky's hotel room was burglarized while he was out to dinner. It was claimed to be a professional job, but police declined to comment on the extent of the items that were taken. * In October, after the Athens Court of Appeals examined the charges brought against Gusinsky by the Russian Federation, it refused the extradition request. The Court of Appeals held that the charges alleged against Gusinsky were not unlawful under Greek law. 2004 * In May 2004, the European Court of Human Rights held that the arrest and criminal charges against Gusinsky were in violation of Article 5 and Article 18 of the Convention on Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms, stating that the facts of the case established that the prosecution of Gusinsky in Russia was politically motivated and used to intimidate him. The Russian Federation appealed. In November, the European Court of Human Rights declined Russian Federation's request to review its decision, thereby upholding its ruling. 2005 * Gusinsky consolidated his television production operations into a new holding company named New Media Distribution Company. The company became one of the largest producers of original scripted television dramas for broadcast in prime time in the Russian language, selling its productions to a number of Russian television broadcasting networks, including NTV and RTR, as well as to other broadcasters in other Russian speaking areas of the world (or where Russian is widely spoken). In the last 10 years the NMDC has produced over 3,000 original episodes, many of which have won awards and garnered high viewership shares. NMDC also owns a number of pay television thematic channels, including Detskii Mir (Children's World), TeleKlub, Nashe Kino (Our Movies) and Mir Seriala (World of Series). NMDC is headquartered in George Town, the Cayman Islands, and has operating subsidiaries in Russia and a number of other European countries. * In March, the Israeli police initiated a money laundering probe into the employees and clients of Bank Hapoalim, Branch 535. Bank Hapoalim is one of the largest and oldest banks in Israel. Gusinsky was among a number of people who were investigated. A year later, the Israeli Prosecutor's Office dropped all charges against Gusinsky without any additional conditions or negotiations and with prejudice. Several years later, in 2010, the Israeli courts have determined that the actions of the Prosecutor's Office in this money laundering investigation were excessive and unreasonable and sanctioned the prosecutors involved in the investigation. * In December, Gusinsky created a sister site to Newsru.com, called Newsru.co.il. While it had an independent editorial board, it retained a similar design as the Russian counterpart. The Israeli site provided Russian language news about Israel's domestic and international affairs as well as world news. Currently, Newsru.co.il is among the most popular Russian language news sites in Israel. It has an average of 20 million page views and 1.5 million unique visitors monthly. 2007 * In first quarter of 2007, Gusinsky decided to create a general entertainment television channel in Ukraine. Gusinsky started to work with an acquaintance, Konstantin Kagalovsky, to jointly bring the Ukrainian TV project to life. * In April, Gusinsky opened a new sister internet project, this time in Ukraine ‚Äì Newsru.ua, similar to the Russian and Israeli sites, it had an independent editorial board but retained the design, and provided news about Ukrainian's domestic and international affairs and world news. This site was featured both in the Russian and Ukrainian languages. 2008 * In March, Gusinsky and Kagalovsky jointly put the general entertainment channel in Ukraine on air, naming it TVi. TVi was quickly and steadily rising in both coverage and popularity. 2009 * In the spring, Gusinsky and Kagalovsky began to have disputes about the direction TVi was taking. In September, Kagalovsky surreptitiously and, according to him, in a \\"Russian-Ukrainian way\\", diluted Gusinsky's share in TVi from 50% to less than 1%. In December, Gusinsky sued Kagalovsky for theft of TVi, in the Supreme Court of New York Commercial Division. 2012 * In March, Gusinsky sold RTVi to Ruslan Sokolov, a Russian media executive and businessman. * In August, Gusinky won a judgement against Kagalovsky and his companies for theft of TVi in an amount of over US$30 million. Kagalovsky appealed. 2014 * In April, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the judgment against Kagalovsky for theft of TVi. Other investments Gusinsky had a shareholding in the Hapoel Tel Aviv basketball team for a period of three and a half years, acquiring 60% of the team in November 2000. Until November 2008, Gusinsky held 27% of the shares in the prominent Israeli second largest newspaper Maariv, which he exchanged with Bank Hapolaim to settle a debt to the bank. He was one of the main forces behind the Moscow Holocaust museum, having lost several family members to the Holocaust. Property in Spain In the Cadiz province of Andalusia in the town of San Roque at Sotogrande, Gusinsky purchased during the early 1990s Krusero () a luxurious villa on a property. During the 1990s, Gusinsky stated that Gibraltar is his \\"financial homeland\\" and that Spain is his \\"second home\\". He often travels by boat for the trip from Sotogrande to Gibraltar where his Gulfstream jet is kept. See also *Michael R.

The name is a concatenation of the Roman numeral X, meaning ten, and the initials of \\"Attachment Unit Interface\\". The purpose of the XGMII Extender, which is composed of an XGXS (XGMII Extender Sublayer) at the MAC end, an XGXS at the PHY end and a XAUI between them, is to extend the operational distance of the XGMII and to reduce the number of interface signals. Applications include extending the physical separation possible between MAC and PHY components in a 10 Gigabit Ethernet system distributed across a circuit board. Operation XGMII Extender has the following characteristics: * Simple signal mapping to the XGMII * Independent transmit and receive data paths * Four lanes conveying the XGMII 32-bit data and control * Differential signaling with low voltage swing (1600 mVp-p) * Self- timed interface allows jitter control to the PCS * Shared technology with other 10 Gbit/s interfaces * Shared functionality with other 10 Gbit/s Ethernet blocks * Utilization of 8b/10b encoding The following is a list of the major concepts of XGXS and XAUI: * The optional XGMII Extender can be inserted between the Reconciliation Sublayer and the PHY (physical layer) to transparently extend the physical reach of the XGMII and reduce the interface pin count from 72 to 16. * The XGMII is organized into four lanes with each lane conveying a data octet or control character on each edge of the associated clock. The source XGXS converts bytes on an XGMII lane into a self clocked, serial, 8b/10b encoded data stream. Each of the four XGMII lanes is transmitted across one of the four XAUI lanes. * The source XGXS converts XGMII Idle control characters (interframe) into an 8b/10b code sequence. The destination XGXS recovers clock and data from each XAUI lane and deskews the four XAUI lanes into the single-clock XGMII. * The destination XGXS adds to or deletes from the interframe as needed for clock rate disparity compensation prior to converting the interframe code sequence back into XGMII Idle control characters. * The XGXS uses the same code and coding rules as the 10GBASE-X PCS and PMA specified in Clause 48 of the IEEE 802.3 Specification. * Each of the 4 Receive and Transmit lanes operates at a rate of 3.125 Gbit/s. * Capabilities have been built into XAUI to overcome the inter-lane signal- skewing problems using a type of automatic de-skewing. Signals can be launched at the transmitter end of a XAUI line without precisely matching the routing of the four lanes, and the signals will be automatically de-skewed at the receiver.  RXAUI  Reduced Pin eXtended Attachment Unit Interface (RXAUI) is a proprietary modification created by MarvellMarvell MV-S 105386-00 RXAUI Interface and RXAUI Adapter Specifications and Dune NetworksDune Networks DN- DS-RXAUI-Spec v1.0, RXAUI - Reduced Pin XAUI (later acquired by BroadcomBroadcom buys Dune Networks for $178M to make insanely fast networking chips) aimed to increase the port density by decreasing the interface pin count. The four lanes of the standard XAUI running at 3.125 Gbit/s are replaced by two lanes at 6.25 Gbit/s. Thus 16 pins of an integrated circuit (4 transmit + 4 receive differential pairs) can provide either one XAUI port or two RXAUI ports. The specification also defines a XAUI to RXAUI adapter, and provides an implementation as Verilog RTL code. FPGA vendors are offering their own implementations as IP blocks.Xilinx, LogiCORE IP RXAUI v2.1Altera, 10 Gigabit Reduced XAUI PCS Core Product Brief Applications =Intended Use= The implementation of XAUI as an optional XGMII Extender is primarily intended as a chip-to-chip (integrated circuit to integrated circuit) interface implemented with traces on a printed circuit board. Where the XGMII is electrically limited to distances of approximately 7 cm, the XGMII Extender allows distances up to approximately 50 cm. =Rate of operation= The XGMII Extender supports the 10 Gbit/s data rate of the XGMII. The 10 Gbit/s MAC data stream is converted into four lanes at the XGMII (by the Reconciliation Sublayer for transmit or the PHY for receive). The byte stream of each lane is 8b/10b encoded by the XGXS for transmission across the XAUI at a nominal rate of 3.125 gigabaud. The XGXS at the PHY end of the XGMII Extender (PHY XGXS) and the XGXS at the RS end (DTE XGXS) may operate on independent clocks. =Allocation of functions= The XGMII Extender is transparent to the Reconciliation Sublayer and PHY device, and operates symmetrically with similar functions on the DTE transmit and receive data paths. The XGMII Extender is logically composed of two XGXSs interconnected with a XAUI data path in each direction. One XGXS acts as the source to the XAUI data path in the DTE transmit path and as the destination in the receive path. The other XGXS is the destination in the transmit path and source in the receive path. Each XAUI data path is composed of four serial lanes. All specifications for the XGMII Extender are written assuming conversion from XGMII to XAUI and back to XGMII, but other techniques may be employed provided that the result is that the XGMII Extender operates as if all specified conversions had been made. One example of this is the use of the optional XAUI with the 10GBASE-LX4 8b/10b PHY, where the XGXS interfacing to the Reconciliation Sublayer provides the PCS and PMA functionality required by the PHY. An XGXS layer is not required at the PHY end of the XAUI in this case. However, means may still be required to remove jitter introduced on the XAUI in order to meet PHY jitter requirements.

It is a single territorial infantry battalion that was formed by the amalgamation in 1965 of two originally voluntary units, the mostly black Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA) and the almost entirely white Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC). History Remembrance Day parade, at the Cenotaph, in the City of Hamilton, 1990. HE The Governor, Major-General Sir Desmond Langley inspects war veterans, and is speaking with former Second-in-Command of the Royal Bermuda Regiment Major Donald Henry \\"Bob\\" Burns, MC. The original Bermuda Militia had existed from 1612 to 1815, and all military-aged males were required to serve. This militia ceased to exist after the War of 1812 as the Government of Bermuda saw it as an unnecessary expense, given the buildup of regular army units that had begun as a result of the 1795 establishment of the Royal Naval base in Bermuda. During the subsequent decades, short-lived militias were raised within the Bermuda Garrison without a Militia Act or any financial contribution from the local parliament (Bermudians who enlisted in this way probably included Robert John Simmons, who later served as First Sergeant in the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War as, in recommending Simmons as a valuable recruit, prominent abolitionist William Wells Brown described him as a young man of more than ordinary abilities who had learned the science of war in the British Army). Although the local government for decades resisted pleas from the governor, the War Office, and the Secretary of State for Defence to restore a part-time reserve, it was not until the Secretary of State for Defence made it a condition of his approval of American investment into the Princess Hotel and the widening of the shipping channel into St. George's Harbour that the local government authorised the creation of three units. Of these, only two were raised. The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery were raised in 1894 and 1895, respectively, in order to allow the Regular Army component of the Bermuda Garrison to be reduced. This was done primarily as an economic measure, though the regular units withdrawn were required for the build-up of what would become the British Expeditionary Force. Both units served through the two world wars, sending contingents to serve overseas in general non- combat duties while shouldering their responsibilities for the defence of Bermuda and its strategic assets. They were reorganised as Territorial Army units between the world wars, and joined by the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers in 1931 and the Bermuda Militia Infantry in 1939, though the two newer units (along with a wartime Home Guard) were permanently disbanded in 1946. Western Front in July 1916 Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps soldiers serving on the Western Front with the Lincolnshire Regiment, 1918 The Bermuda Militia Artillery (which had absorbed the remaining Bermuda Militia Infantry personnel) and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps were demobilised in 1946, retaining only skeleton Permanent Staffs while most of their personnel were placed on the reserve. A new defence act was passed in 1949 (re-titling the BVRC as the Bermuda Rifles) and both units were brought back up to strength in 1951, with many previously discharged soldiers re-enlisting. Strength for both units was set at about 200 personnel. In 1953, when the coastal artillery batteries were taken out of use, the BMA, while still wearing the Royal Artillery cap badge, converted to the infantry role. This left the colony wastefully maintaining two separate infantry units, each of a single company commanded by a major. There was also, now, a Headquarters Bermuda Local Forces, which was a common battalion-level Headquarters Company for both the BMA and the Bermuda Rifles, though not part of either unit and with its own badge. This contained not only the headquarters, but also sub-units shared by both the BMA, such as signals and instructors. This headquarters, commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, fell under the garrison's Command Headquarters at Prospect Camp, commanded by a regular army brigadier. John F. Kennedy, escorted by a Bermuda Militia Artillery officer in Royal Artillery blue No. 1 Dress, inspects green-uniformed riflemen of the Bermuda Rifles in 1961 After closure of the Royal Navy's dockyard commenced in 1951 (a process that lasted until 1958, leaving only a small naval base, HMS Malabar, within the former dockyard), the military garrison, which had existed primarily to protect the Royal Navy base, was also closed. The Command Headquarters, the last regular infantry unit (a company of the DCLI), and various supporting attachments and detachments (Royal Engineers, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Army Service Corps, et cetera) was withdrawn in 1957, and the two Bermudian territorials ceased to have any military tasking under Imperial defence planning (with 1953 being the last year an Imperial Defence Plan, under which their roles were assigned, was issued). Although the colonial government had only formed the two units at the behest of and under pressure from the British government, it chose to continue maintaining them entirely at its own expense (although defence falls within the remit of the national British government, rather than the internal government of the colony). The presence of the part-time units, and their abilities to take on all of the roles of the garrison, had been part of the British Government's justification for withdrawing the Command Headquarters and the regular infantry. RSM of the Bermuda Regiment WO1 Herman Eve in 1992 The amalgamation of the Headquarters Bermuda Local Forces, Bermuda Militia Artillery, and Bermuda Rifles took place on 1 September 1965. Headquarters Bermuda Local Forces had been based at the former Admiralty House since 1957, and remained there as the Headquarters Company of the Bermuda Regiment under the command of Major Donald Henry \\"Bob\\" Burns, MC. This still included sub-units that supported both rifle companies, such as signals, and now also included a unified band (previously the BMA and Bermuda Rifles each had retained its own). Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. Tucker, the last officer commanding Bermuda Local Forces, became the first commanding officer of the Bermuda Regiment. The BMA had relocated from St. David's Battery to join the Bermuda Rifles at Warwick Camp in 1953. Initially, the new Bermuda Regiment kept one rifle company at Warwick Camp and the other at Admiralty House, with the Headquarters Company, until this was destroyed in 1973, with all subunits at Warwick Camp since then. The Bermuda Regiment, and its forebears, was deployed a number of times during the 1960s and 1970s as the demand for equal rights and desegregation occasionally threatened or spilled over into civil disobedience. The unit was deployed when a curfew was declared after a riot in 1968. , based at , stood by to lend aid, and B Company of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers was flown in to reinforce the Bermuda Regiment, though the situation had returned to normal before its arrival. A black power conference in 1969 led to a detachment of eighty Royal Marines being despatched to HMS Malabar by 45 Commando. Black power militants, inspired by the Black Panther Party in the nearby United States, organised as the Black Beret Cadre during the conference. A riot in 1970 led to the Bermuda Regiment being deployed. Commissioner of the Bermuda Police Service George Duckett was murdered at his home in 1972. In 1973, governor and commander in chief Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Sharples, his aide-de-camp, Captain Hugh Sayers, (both of the Welsh Guards) and the governor's dog, Horsa, were murdered while walking the Government House grounds. The Bermuda Regiment was deployed, assisted by an airborne forces (the 23 Parachute Field Ambulance, 1 Parachute Logistic Regiment and the band of the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment), then training at Warwick Camp, and a detachment of Royal Marines from , based in Bermuda, guarding key points and various senior civil, naval and military officials who might also have become targets of assassination. A month later, two staff members, including Lance-Corporal Mark Doe of the Bermuda Regiment, were murdered in the robbery of a supermarket in the City of Hamilton. Two men with possible links to the Black Beret Cadre, Erskine Durrant \\"Buck\\" Burrows and Larry Tacklyn, were arrested and convicted of the five murders and sentenced to death in 1976. The death penalty remained in place in Bermuda despite the passage in the United Kingdom of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, but a moratorium on its use had been observed for more than three decades. Some black Bermudians felt the investigation and the trial had been hurried, and were unconvinced of the guilt of Burrows and Tacklyn. Some militant-minded blacks doubtless saw the murders as justified. Many more blacks, whatever their opinions on the crimes or the guilt of the convicted men, felt the death penalties were racially motivated, and passions were inflamed by the rhetoric of Black nationalists. Despite the threat of civil unrest, the Bermuda Regiment was not pre-emptively deployed before the executions. Riots broke out on the night of the executions, 1 December 1977, a state of emergency was declared on 2 December, and the Bermuda Regiment was deployed. Despite a curfew, the riots carried on for three days. Detachments from the Royal Regiment of Wales and the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers were hurried to Bermuda to reinforce the Bermuda Regiment. The state of emergency was lifted on 9 December, by which time $9 million of damage had been wrought to properties, mostly in the City of Hamilton. With the improvements and increased opportunities experienced by most black Bermudians since the Civil Rights Era, the threat of civil unrest receded after the 1970s. Although the Bermuda Regiment is still tasked with supporting the civil police in times of emergency, it has been obliged to adapt to new roles to maintain relevance, most particularly disaster relief following hurricanes in Bermuda and in British West Indian territories. The new Bermuda Regiment's stand of colours was presented in November, 1965 by Princess Margaret. Princess Margaret presented a second stand of colours to replace the first in November, 1990, to mark the Bermuda Regiment's 25th anniversary. The Royal Bermuda Regiment is not entitled to inherit the battle honours of the units amalgamated into it, so they are not displayed on its colours and are rarely mentioned. The battle honours it inherits from the BVRC, all from World War I, are Ypres 1915, Neuve Chapelle, Loos, Somme 1916, Ypres 1917, Lys, Hindenburg Line, Messines 1917, Somme 1918 (the BMA had no battle honours specific to itself to hand down, although its contingents had taken part in battles such as Vimy Ridge and the Somme, and as part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, it had the honour ubique; everywhere). This is ostensibly due to the gap formed by the disbandment of the BVRC and the formation of the Bermuda Rifles, although a skeleton command structure remained after the BVRC's 1946 disbandment and was brought back up to strength to form the Bermuda Rifles in 1951. This was also not the first time the unit had been disbanded. Originally a volunteer unit, the BVRC (and BMA) had also been briefly disbanded after the First World War. On that occasion, it had been re-deployed as a territorial (a process that had taken place in Britain and Ireland in 1908 when the Volunteer Force, Militia, and Yeomanry had been merged, their units linked to Regular Army regiments and terms of service introduced for recruits, who were no longer permitted to quit their service with 14 days notice) although it had continued to be titled as a volunteer rifle corps until 1951. As reformed after the First World War, the BVRC had retained its identity and its battle honours. The latest set of Colours were presented by Duchess of Gloucester, GCVO at the National Sports Centre on 13 November 2010. The former set will be retired to the Bermuda National Museum, before being formally laid up in the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess. The third set of Colours have been donated by the Bermuda Regiment Charitable Trust. In 1945, the part-time reserve units in Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta had numbered collectively as 28th in the British Army order of precedence, but were ordered within that according to the order of precedence of their parent corps in the regular army. This meant, that the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), as part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery and the Militia, preceded the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) (as part of the infantry and the Volunteer Force) despite being the second of the two to be raised. Today, the Royal Bermuda Regiment, as an amalgam of the BMA and BVRC, is 29th and was formerly 28th which changed in 2007 with the Special Reconnaissance Regimenthttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4412907.stm being added to the Order of Precedence. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-queens-regulations-for-the- army-1975-amendment-number-37 The Quarterly Army List, DECEMBER, 1946.

Badge The badge of the Royal Bermuda Regiment combines elements from those of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and the BVRC. The full badge, as displayed on the Colours, features two crossed cannons creating an X behind a Maltese cross (the symbol of rifle regiments in the British Army, and used on the white metal BVRC badge), set on a circular shield with \\"THE BERMUDA REGIMENT\\" inscribed around it, and the whole enclosed within a wreath and surmounted by the Crown. The cap badge is bi-metal ‚Äì all brass, except a white metal Maltese cross, which is set inside the wheel of a cannon (taken from the badge of the Royal Artillery), with a half-wreath about the lower hemisphere of the badge. Flashes, and other colour marks used on dress and elsewhere (such as backgrounds on signs about Warwick Camp) are red and blue, reflecting the colours of the Royal Artillery, but the stable belt (issued only to permanent staff, officers and senior ranks) worn is rifle green, with black edges, referring to the colours used by the BVRC. The badge of the Royal Bermuda Regiment (bottom) draws elements from those of the BMA (Royal Artillery, second from left) and the BVRC (second from right). The badge at the left is that of the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, affiliated to the BVRC, and that at the right belongs to the Royal Anglian Regiment, its successor. Dress Bermuda Regiment Warrant Officers in the No. 1 dress No. 3 (Summer) Dress at Warwick Camp in June, 1994. The dress uniform itself is closer to the old Royal Artillery pattern, and to the generic No. 1 dress uniform used by many British regiments today, being composed of dark blue, almost black, tunic and trousers, and differing only in the red cuffs and collar added to the tunic. The trousers have a broad red stripe running down the outside of each leg. A generic dark blue peaked cap with red hat band is worn with this uniform. During the summer months, the No. 3 uniform is worn (identical to the No. 1 except that a light-weight generic, white tunic is worn). As the majority of public ceremonial duties actually take place during the summer months, the No. 1 uniform was little used by comparison to the No. 3 and has been withdrawn from general ceremonial usage. The No. 3 uniform is now worn for ceremonial parade year round. Although neither the BMA nor the BVRC were line infantry, a Full Dress with red tunic (historically worn by line infantry) is worn only by regimental drummers. DPM No.9: Tropical Combat Dress trousers and Soldier 95 shirt The combat uniform is now the British Army Multi-Terrain Pattern, which replaced the Soldier 95 uniform of the previous decade beginning in 2012. For much of the Regiment's history, its dress included a mixed collection of British uniform items. As with its predecessors, the Royal Bermuda Regiment has a tradition of wearing temperate uniforms (including combat jackets and pullovers) for much of the year; and tropical uniforms during the summer months. This is a result of the peculiar climate of Bermuda, which is chilly, wet, and windy during the winter, and can reach 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) during the summer with high humidity. For many years, and unusually for an infantry unit, the regiment wore the Denison parachute smock which it inherited from its predecessors, only adopting the 1968 pattern DPM combat jacket in the 1980s (which it issued into the new millennium, although the 1968 uniform actually became obsolete with Regular British Army regiments in the 1980s). At the time of amalgamation, the basic combat uniform worn under the Denison was composed of the Second World War-era green tropical shirt and trousers, ankle boots and puttees. Carrying equipment was initially the 1937 Pattern. By the early 1980s, these uniform items had been replaced by the green lightweight trousers, green shirt and sweater, 1968 Pattern combat jacket, high boots (otherwise identical to the old ankle boot), and the 1958 Pattern carrying equipment. Green shirts and lightweight combat trousers began to be supplemented by DPM tropical uniforms in the 1980s, and by the mid 1990s had been entirely replaced by them (although the green kit, like the Denison smocks, was handed down to the Regiment's Junior Leaders and to the Bermuda Cadet Corps, which continued to wear it). The tropical DPM uniform (worn in colder weather with the '68 Pattern Combat Jacket and the green pullover) was fully adopted by 1994, and continued to be issued for some time after its replacement in Britain by the Soldier 95 uniform. The beret worn is the dark blue one worn by the Royal Artillery and by various British Army units not authorised to wear distinctive colours of their own. Little use is made of Service Dress, which is only issued to a handful of permanent staff members. The colour varies slightly from the standard British Army khaki (being greener), and during the summer months, the long trousers might be replaced with shorts. The Royal Bermuda Regiment service dress is composed of a jacket and trousers worn with an olive green peaked cap, tan shirt and tie. Whereas its predecessors often used the tropical-weight No. 4 Service Dress during the summer months, the Royal Bermuda Regiment uses the same uniform year-round, worn during the summer in shirt sleeve order ‚Äì usually, a short-sleeved tan shirt with no tie, whether worn with long trousers or shorts of the same weight and colour. A stable belt is worn in shirt sleeve order. Mess dress is also worn for many functions by members of the Officers' Mess, and of the Sergeants' (and Warrant Officers') Mess. Organisation =Leadership= A Command Centre during IS training. PNCO Cadre train in Internal Security (IS) role. Bermuda Regiment soldiers aboard a motor boat, off the North Shore of Bermuda, 1996. As Bermuda is a British overseas territory, and defence is therefore the responsibility of the United Kingdom, the Royal Bermuda Regiment is under the control of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the island. However, pay and financing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour, Home Affairs and Housing. The Royal Bermuda Regiment (RBR) is listed in the British Army Order of Battle as number 29th in order of precedence. The RBR traditionally was number 28th in the order of precedence but due to the first time listing on the order of precedence of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment which is the newest Combat Arm/Corp. The Order of Precedence for the Army and within the Infantry, 09: Honours, Awards, Royal and Ceremonial Events, Defence Instruction and Notices released 1 August 2007, MoD PS12(A), Reference: 2007DIN09-027 and Army General and Admin Instructions, Volume 2, Chapter 69, Legal Matters (AGAI69) dated August 2017 and page 8/1-1, Chapeter 8, Ceremonial Part 1- Precedence, Precedence of Corps and Regiments, paragraph 8.001., The Queen's Regulations for thee Army 1975, Admendment 37, dated May 2019. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-queens-regulations-for- the-army-1975-amendment-number-37 On its formation, the regiment's Honorary Colonel was Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, who became Colonel-in- Chief in 1984. After her death in 2002, the position was assumed, in 2004 by The Duchess of Gloucester. The unit is directly commanded by a lieutenant- colonel, as is typical of a battalion in the British Army, who is appointed by the governor upon the advice of a Defence Board. Brian Gonsalves was appointed on 28 May 2009, to serve for a standard three-year tenure. In some cases that tenure can be extended by the governor for a further year. In Lieutenant Colonel Gonsalves' case, he filled the role until passing command to Lieutenant Colonel Foster-Brown in June 2013. The current visiting EU advisor of the regiment is Commandant H. Kunz of Coburg, Germany. =Manpower = The Regiment's original strength was about 400, including all ranks. Following discipline problems during an exercise in the West Indies, a report on the unit was commissioned from Maj-General Glyn Gilbert, the highest-ranking Bermudian in the British Army. Maj-Gen. Gilbert also took into account the difficulties the regiment had experienced in meeting its obligations when deployed during the civil unrest of 1977. He made a number of recommendations, including the increase of the Regiment's strength to a full battalion of about 750, with three rifle companies (A, B, and C) and a support company. As the support functions (Regimental Quartermaster Stores and Internal Security Stores, Armourers, Motor Transport, Boat Troop, Gun Troop/Assault Pioneers, Medics, cooks, et cetera) and the Band now fell under Support Company (commanded by the Regimental Quartermaster), the battalion headquarters was no longer considered a company in its own right. Initially, the three rifle companies rotated through the role of training company. Eventually, C Company was renamed permanent Training Company. Recruits spent their first year in Training Company, then transferred as a unit to whichever rifle company was losing its third-year conscripts, or were reassigned individually to other sub-units. = Structure = Today, following a steady reduction in the number of 18-year-old males eligible for conscription each year, the regiment has a strength of approximately 609, with a full-time administrative component of 30. After a review in the late 1990s, the Royal Bermuda Regiment had its establishment reduced to its present format: *A Company: Second and third year soldiers. *Training Company: First year soldiers *Support Company: Boat Troop, Regimental Police, Signals, Guns/Assault Pioneers, Medics and Motor Transport section. *Quartermasters Company: Logistics and stores. *Band Company: Music and Ceremonial. *Training Wing One of the units amalgamated into the Royal Bermuda Regiment, the BMA, was nominally an artillery unit, although it had converted to the infantry role in 1953. Other than a ceremonial Gun Troop, equipped with two 25-pdr. field guns, the Royal Bermuda Regiment is wholly an infantry unit. =Conscription= Recruits clean their Mini-14 rifles, prior to a shoot at Warwick Camp, during the 1994 Recruit Camp.The majority of the regiment was made up of conscripts up to July 2018, making it unique among all of the land forces under the British Crown. Conscription was based on a random lottery of men through the ages of 18 to 23, with exemptions granted to Police and Prison officers, members of the British regular forces (or men who have served for two years), church ministers, prisoners or those judged to be of \\"unsound mind\\". Temporary deferment was granted for full-time students (attending either the Bermuda College or schools abroad), for the length of their studies, and individuals medically unfit but likely to become fit again. Conscientious objectors had the opportunity to either serve in a non-combatant role or perform an alternative community service chosen by the governor. Both Bermudians and non-Bermudians criticised conscription for its alleged sexism and similarity to slavery (a sensitive issue given the historic background of Bermuda), and this has been noted in the British Parliament. It received support from the community, however, and was hailed for causing interaction between social and racial groups. At its height, three-quarters of the strength of the Bermuda Regiment was made up of conscripts, although many soldiers, whether they initially volunteered or were conscripted, elected to re-engage annually after their initial three years and two months term of service was completed, with some serving for decades (such as WO2 Bernard Pitman, who retired in 2013 after forty years of service).The Royal Gazette: Pitman‚Äôs 40 years in the Regiment recognised, By Ceola Wilson. 4 June 2013. In 2018, the House of Assembly of Bermuda voted to abolish conscription, effective of 1 July 2018. =Recent assessments= Towards the end of 2005, the regiment took part in a fitness for role exercise, this time in the form of an inspection by the Ministry of Defence. The review noted that equipment was substandard and major items would be deemed to be unserviceable by 2010 (half of the vehicles and signal equipment were noted to be \\"out of action\\") and that command and control was poor, though it also noted high morale and firearms proficiency. A subsequent inspection in 2008 revealed that nothing had changed on the equipment issues, with the predicted consequences from the previous report being shown to be true. It was stated that command and control was better than the previous study, albeit with some way to go yet. =Bermuda Regiment Junior Leaders and the Bermuda Cadet Corps= The Bermuda Regiment operated its own Junior Leaders programme for many years, until it was absorbed into the separate Bermuda Cadet Corps in the 1990s. The Junior Leaders had been part of the Bermuda Regiment, wearing the same cap badge and operating from Warwick Camp, whereas the Bermuda Cadet Corp was a separate organisation, operating through the island's secondary schools (having been reformed from the old Cadet Corps in 1965, at the same time as the amalgamation of the BVRC and BMA). In 2012, due to financial constraints, the Bermuda Cadet Corps was disbanded and replaced by the resurrected Bermuda Regiment Junior Leaders.The Royal Gazette: Cadet Corp to be replaced as budget savings are made.

A bill was tabled in the House of Assembly of Bermuda in 2015 to formalise the organisation of the Royal Bermuda Regiment's Junior Leaders.A BILL entitled ROYAL BERMUDA REGIMENT (JUNIOR LEADERS) ACT 2015. Parliament of Bermuda Operations Bermuda Regiment soldiers armed with Mini-14s and a Barbados Police officer conduct a joint patrol of an oil facility during the 2007 Cricket World Cup in Bridgetown, Barbados The primary role of the regiment has recently become disaster relief. Other roles include ceremonial duties, and supporting the Bermuda police department in internal security issues (both in the forms of riot-control and anti-terrorism). In 2001, following the September 11 attacks on the nearby United States, the Bermuda Regiment was deployed, taking over responsibility for the security of the Bermuda International Airport (Bermuda has always been a point of importance in trans-Atlantic aviation, and a large number of aircraft diverted to the Island when US airspace was closed) and other potential targets. In 2004 and 2005 the regiment deployed to the Cayman Islands and Grenada to assist in post Hurricane Ivan restoration efforts. The Bermuda Regiment successfully deployed a platoon of internal security trained soldiers to Barbados in 2007. There they took part in forming the security infrastructure for the WCC Cricket World Cup. They worked alongside soldiers from Barbados, Guyana, India and South Africa, in ensuring a secure environment for the Super 8 series of matches. Although little has been made of this deployment, this was the first time since the First World War that a formed unit from Bermuda has deployed overseas for an operation other than disaster relief (the Second World War drafts from the BMA, BVRC, and BVE were all absorbed into other units, and the cadre of officers and NCOs sent to Belize in the 1980s were attached to a battalion of the Royal Anglians). The Bermuda Regiment also provided a cordon at the Bermuda International Airport in October, 1996, when the Chinese ship, Xing Da, was brought to the island. The ship had been detained on the Atlantic by the United States Coast Guard carrying over a hundred illegal migrants with the intent of smuggling them into Massachusetts. It was intended to transfer the passengers and crew to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, but the ship was deemed unseaworthy. Taking the ship into a US port to transfer the detainees to Cuba was undesirable as the US Government would have then been obliged to allow any who requested to enter the process for asylum application. The only other port within reach was Bermuda, roughly 640 miles from North Carolina and 1,061.4 miles from Guantanamo Bay. As the UK Government was wary of allowing the detainees to set foot on British territory for the same reason, the ship was kept offshore while the two governments negotiated. A Company of the Bermuda Regiment was deployed, pending the outcome. On 9 October, it provided a cordon to close off the Weapons Pier of the former United States Navy NAS Bermuda, while Bermuda Government ferry boats brought the detainees into Castle Harbour. Bermuda Police and US Coast Guard powerboats transferred the detainees to the Weapons Pier, where they were handcuffed and loaded, one-by-one, aboard waiting US Coast Guard C-130 Hercules, with each aeroplane taking off and heading for Cuba as soon as it was full.\\"Bermuda Regiment 50th Anniversary: The Bermuda Regiment SYNOPSIS\\" The regiment also performs a wide variety of community service operations, and is involved in many cultural events on the island, especially in parades. Overseas connections US Navy NAS Bermuda personnel at Camp Lejeune. During the First World War, the Bermuda Regiment's predecessor, the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) sent two contingents to serve with the Lincolnshire Regiment on the Western Front. After the War, the connection to the Lincolns was made official. When the UK Volunteer Force, Yeomanry, and Militia had been reorganised into the Territorial Force in 1908 (renamed the Territorial Army after the First World War), the many former Volunteer Rifle Corps became numbered battalions of British (Regular) Army regiments, with the regular regiments adopting paternal roles by providing the part-time units with loaned officers, warrant officers and NCOs, and taking other steps to give them the benefit of their experience. Although the Territorial Force, like the Volunteer Force, was tasked only with home defence, and its soldiers could not originally be compelled to take part in overseas campaigns, the Territorials would send drafts of volunteers to the Regular battalions during wartime, or (once the restriction on sending Territorials overseas without their consent was lifted) the entire TA battalion might be sent. The role the Lincolnshire Regiment adopted with the BVRC was similar to that it played with its own TA battalions, although the BVRC remained a separate unit. The BVRC again provided two drafts to the Lincolns during the Second World War. When the BVRC (renamed the Bermuda Rifles) was amalgamated with the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), to create the Bermuda Regiment, the Royal Anglian Regiment, into which the (Royal) Lincolnshire Regiment had itself been amalgamated, continued the paternal role. Throughout the Bermuda Regiment's history, the Royal Anglians have provided it with its staff officer, and with Permanent Staff Instructors (PSI) (now called full-time instructors (FTI)) warrant officers (WO2) for each of its companies, as well as other personnel on long-term and short-term attachments (although other Regiments have occasionally also provided personnel on loan). Although the Bermuda Regiment had, prior to 2013, always managed to provide commanding officers from within its own strength, it has occasionally had to use seconded officers when unable to provide its own personnel to fill roles such as Second-In-Command (2-i-c), adjutant, regimental sergeant major (RSM), and training officer. Its first nine Adjutants (1965‚Äì1984) were all seconded from the Royal Anglians. Ten of its regimental sergeant majors have been seconded, including three from the Royal Anglians (WO1 R. Jones (1976-1978), WO1 B. Bear (1985-1986), and WO1 JJ Wilcox (1987-1989)). In 1996, its Second-in-Command, staff officer, and adjutant were all on loan from the Royal Anglians. This frequent resort to seconded officers is due to a problem common to many Territorial units in Britain, also. These positions are all full-time ones, ideally filled by officers who volunteer from within the regiment, but whose service in these roles is restricted to three years. As relatively few officers can afford to leave their civil careers for three years, the problem is not so much caused by a lack of suitable officers, as a lack of willing ones. The Lincolnshire Regiment was also affiliated to The Lincoln and Welland Regiment of the Canadian Army. Although joint training has occurred in the past, and short-term loans of NCOs from the Lincoln & Welland Regiment have been frequent (especially for Recruit Camps and Overseas Camps), numerous attempts to formalise the affiliation with the Bermuda Regiment have been unsuccessful. Members of the ceremonial Gun Troop carry out occasional ceremonial training with the Royal Regiment of Artillery, which provides its sergeant major instructor of gunnery to conduct local courses, although the troop has no combat artillery role. As one of the units amalgamated into the Bermuda Regiment, the BMA, was an artillery unit (which history the Gun Troop commemorates), members of the regiment are entitled to join the Royal Artillery Association (RAA), which has a branch located on the grounds of the former St. George's Garrison (which had been predominantly a Royal Garrison Artillery establishment).

Two soldiers from the Bermuda Regiment's Guns/Assault Pioneers with a US Marine Corps engineer at Camp Lejeune in 2013 The Bermuda Regiment also developed a relationship with the United States Marine Corps, which had supplied a detachment to Bermuda for many years to guard United States Navy facilities. In addition to occasional training with the US Marines in Bermuda, the Bermuda Regiment used facilities and training areas of the US Marines' Camp Lejeune and Camp Geiger in North Carolina for training, with the two rifle companies having been sent there every second year for their annual camps. The Training Company's Potential Non-Commissioned Officers (PNCO) Cadre is also sent there each June (it had previously been sent to Canada). Following the increased usage of those bases, after 2001, by US forces preparing for deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bermuda Regiment briefly moved the location for its annual camps to Florida, where it was developing a relationship with the Florida National Guard, although it subsequently recommenced the use of Camp Lejeune. The Bermuda Regiment took part in its first exercise overseas in 1968, when twenty-eight personnel were deployed to Jamaica on 26 October, along with \\"A\\" Company of the York and Lancaster Regiment, for a four-week introduction to jungle warfare in the vicinity of Berriedale, in Portland. Jamaica became the location of annual camps in alternate years, but in March, 2013, it was announced that a new location would be sought.The Jamaica Gleaner: Bermuda Regiment To End Training Camps In JamaicaJamaica Observer: Bermuda Regiment to end Jamaican training camps This was due to the cost of deploying to Jamaica (a flight of 1,249 miles, compared to 725 miles for the flight to MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina), given the budgetary constraints, and as Jamaica provided little opportunity for training in Internal Security roles, such as is available at USMCB Camp Lejeune with its Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) facility.Special Operations.com The Camp Lejeune MOUT Facility.

Originally, there was a four-year limit to the term of a commanding officer, which could be extended if required. Following Lieutenant-Colonel Gavin A. Shorto's six years in the office, a three-year appointment was made the norm.

The Bermuda Recorder, 5 February 1964. Page 1. The .303 inch Bren light machine gun and Vickers machine gun were replaced by the 7.62mm NATO General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Bermuda Regiment inherited the SLR and the GPMG from its predecessors. For Internal Security use, the Federal Riot Gun being used in Northern Ireland for firing baton rounds and gas canisters was also adopted. The Bermudian reserve forces had been equipped with standard British Army weapons since their restoration in 1895 (although the Sten sub-machine gun had been replaced in the 1960s with the Israeli Uzi instead of the Sterling). A non-standard rifle was to replace the SLR, however. During the 1950s, the British forces had been pressured into dropping the .280 British sub-calibre round and EM-2 rifle that had been intended to replace respectively .303 inch ammunition and the No. 4 rifle, adopting instead the American 7.62mm ammunition as NATO standard and the SLR, which was a variant of the Belgian FN FAL. Despite forcing the adoption of the 7.62mm round by NATO, the US re-equipped during the Vietnam War with the M16 rifle, chambered for the 5.56√ó45mm M193 sub-calibre ammunition.Ezell, Edward Clinton (1984).

The History and Development of the M16 Rifle and its Cartridge. Oceanside, California: Armory Publications. . Dissatisfaction with the 7.62mm round led NATO to seek a replacement during the 1970s, and the Belgian SS109 variant of the American M193 was adopted as 5.56mm NATO.[ss109.com 5.56mm (.223) PARAMILITARY AMMUNITION, by John Schaefer. Rifle magazine, January/February, 1988, pages 36, 37, 70 and 71.] Although it had also been intended to establish a NATO standard rifle, this did not materialise and different countries developed their own small arms. The Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock had actually begun work in 1969 on a family of weapons mechanically based on the ArmaLite AR-18, but chambered for a 4.85 √ó 49mm cartridge and with a bullpup configuration similar to the EM-2. This design was rechambered for the 5.56mm NATO and re-designated the SA80 (Small Arms for the 1980s). The family included two basic weapons: the XL64E5 rifle (also called the Enfield Individual Weapon) and a light support weapon known as the XL65E4 light machine gun (which were to be standardised as the L85A1 rifle and L86A1 Light-Support Weapon). The SA80 would remain stuck in development, however, until 1987, when the L85A1 and L86A1 began replacing respectively the SLR and the GPMG (together with the remaining Brens, which had been retained for jungle use and re-chambered for 7.62mm) in the British armed forces. Re-equipment was slow, and many second-line units were still equipped with the older weapons during the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War. The Bermuda Regiment decided not to wait for the SA80 and replaced the SLR with the American-made Ruger Mini-14 self-loading (in American parlance, \\"semi automatic\\") rifle in 1983. The GPMG was retained in the light-, as well as the medium-, machine gun role. The Ruger has a 20-round detachable box magazine and can be fitted with a US M7 bayonet. The original wooden stocks were replaced with Choate black plastic stocks by 1992 and no further modifications have been made since. Small numbers of the SA80 (L85A1 and L85A2) were held from about 1990 specifically for familiarisation training. This was necessary as large numbers of personnel must attend courses (for training, commissioning, or qualification) in Britain, and many serve on active duty attachments (particularly with the Royal Anglian Regiment), and needed to already be knowledgeable of the standard rifle. A replacement for the aging Rugers was sought at the end of the Century, with small numbers of the German Heckler & Koch G36 and the American Colt M4 (a carbine variant of the M16) obtained for trials, following which the G36 had been selected as a replacement for the Ruger and the Uzi sub-machine gun. However, budgetary issues delayed the acquisition of the G36, which also became surrounded by controversy in Germany over reported inaccuracy in warm temperatures.The Guardian: German military to stop using gun \\"that can't shoot straight when hot\\". Reuters in Berlin, Wednesday, 22 April 2015 The Ruger was instead replaced by the L85A2 version of the SA80 rifle, with 400 having been delivered in August, 2015.

There, Parliamentary forces serving under Sir William Waller led a successful surprise attack on a winter garrison of Royalist infantry and cavalry serving under the Earl of Crawford. The Battle of Alton was the first decisive defeat of Sir Ralph Hopton, leader of Royalist forces in the south, and the event had a significant psychological effect on him as commander. More important to Hopton was the loss of men, however, as he was already short-handed in much-needed infantry. The successful Parliamentarians were able, after their victory, to attack and successfully besiege Arundel, a larger and more formidable Royalist outpost to the south-east of Alton. At dawn on the 13th, as Waller's army approached Alton, Crawford fled with the cavalry to Winchester, leaving Colonel Richardus Boles to defend Alton with only the infantry. Outnumbered and overpowered, Boles's men were soon forced to seek refuge in the Church of St Lawrence, where they made a desperate last stand. Boles was killed, along with most of his remaining men. The Parliamentarians won a clear victory, losing only a few men and taking many prisoners. Boles's fight is also notable for its demonstrated drama and heroism. Stories boast that Boles killed a number of his enemies before falling himself. The battle of Alton is known as one of the \\"most savage encounters\\" of the English Civil War. Musket holes from the fight can still be seen in the south door to the church and inside, where so many cornered men were killed and captured. The Battle of Alton was also the first battle in the English Civil War to use leather guns, employed effectively by Waller before and during the battle proper. Background On 13 September 1643, the English Parliament ordered Major General William Waller to muster forces for the \\"protection\\" of Hampshire County. In November, he was given control of forces stationed in Farnham, a major Parliamentary staging ground, in order to take control of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire. These forces were supplemented by the Red Regiment (from Westminster) and the Green and Yellow regiments (from London). Also at Waller's disposal was a personal regiment of foot soldiers and surviving cavalry from the Battle of Roundway Down. Waller marched from Farnham for Odiham and Alton, intending to occupy these towns while gradually approaching his objective, Basing. While not of great strategic importance, Basing's proximity to the main road between London, Salisbury, and Winchester made it worthy of attention. Marching toward Alton, Waller halted at Bentley Green on 3 November, where he determined his capabilities. He marched further that day, but later retreated to Farnham. On 2 November, Waller attacked one hundred men of Bennett's at Alton. From 7‚Äì9 November, Waller laid siege to Basing House, but withdrew to Basingstoke in failure, with his soldiers near mutiny from poor weather conditions. He tried again on the night of 11 November, but retreated to Farnham to await Hopton's army. Hopton arrived on 27 November, given by King Charles 1,580 horse, but only around 2,000 conscripted infantry and 500 troops recently returned from fighting in Munster, Ireland. Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push as far as possible toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, quartering them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate the burden on any one town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could. Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment, though his exact number of men is unknown; it was likely around 1,000. Prelude During the week prior to the Battle of Alton, Waller scouted the town and planned his attack. He confided his intent to only a few of his senior men, maintaining secrecy. Waller did make another raid on the evening of 9 December, where a small party of his forces struck at Crawford's lodging but fell back after the minor attack. During the morning hours of 12 December, Crawford sent a missive to Farnham, requesting of Waller that he be sent a \\"runlet of sack\\", promising an ox in exchange. When the wine was sent, Crawford refused to send the ox, challenging Waller to fetch it himself. During this exchange, Waller, eager to repair his reputation after Roundway Down, promptly decided to attack Alton, the nearest Royalist outpost to Farnham and only ten miles away. According to the Mercurius Aulicus, a contemporary publication, Crawford was watching only the main road from Farnham at this time. Battle Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30 p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched west from Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched about two miles in this direction (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00 a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed for the first time in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment. Waller's forces reached the western side of Alton at around 9:00 a.m., capturing six of Crawford's sentries posted in the north. One Royalist sentry, however, managed to raise the alarm just before dawn, leading Crawford and his horse to quit Alton and head for Winchester at a gallop, as Waller approached the town. It is reported that they had promised the remaining infantry men that they would return soon with reinforcements. Initially, Crawford and his cavalry attempted to flee from the eastern border of Alton, but were routed back into town and to the south (heading directly for Winchester) by Parliamentary horse. The fleeing Royalists were chased for a half-mile by Waller's heavy cavalry (these under Sir Arthur Haslerig and nicknamed the \\"Lobsters\\"), losing a few men and some number of horses. Haslerig, forfeiting pursuit, guarded the entrances to the town. Meanwhile, Boles's men concentrated to the north-west corner of town, before the Church of St Lawrence. A regiment of Waller's infantry, five companies of Haslerig's, and five companies of Kentish Men attacked Alton from the north and north- west. The Royalist infantry, however, took effective cover inside buildings, out of which they fired quickly; they particularly favoured a large brick house near the church. This house, however, was soon abandoned as Waller's artillery, positioned at the foot of the hill to the west, fired upon it, forcing these defenders to retreat to the church. The Parliamentary regiments from London and four companies from Farnham Castle descended the hill: Waller's Red Regiment attacked a lunette and breastwork which the Royalists had built and which they were using as an effective fortification. The Green Regiment flanked the Royalists which were behind these fortifications forcing them out, while marching through town under the cover of smoke from a thatch house which they had set on fire. Soon after, the rest of Waller's men entered the town en masse, flying their colours and pushing Boles's men back to the Church of St Lawrence. From the church and nearby fortifications (including a large earthwork on its north side), the Royalists held their ground for two hours. The Royalists fired from the windows of the church, and employed a scaffolding inside the church proper to fire from greater heights. alt=Drawing of the Church of St Lawrence, Alton (1830) Eventually, the Parliamentarians forced the Royalists to abandon the south-east part of the wall around the church. However, since the retreating men had left their muskets sticking up, the Parliamentarians were temporarily unaware that the Royalists had left. After some time it was concluded that the defenders had gone, and the Parliamentary army promptly attacked the churchyard, driving the last of Boles's men into the church itself. Waller's forces threw hand grenades into the windows while working to enter the church themselves. Inside the building, Boles declared he would, \\"run his sword through him which first called for quarter.\\" There had been no time for the Royalists to barricade the church doors, and the Parliamentarians soon managed to gain entry. Inside, the Royalists shot from behind a jury-rigged breastwork of dead horses. Some of Boles's men were killed; others surrendered. Boles did not give up, and he killed up to seven men before being killed himself. With Boles killed, all but a few of the Royalists requested quarter. Inscribed in Boles's honour was this epitaph: > :Alton will tell you of that famous Fight :Which ys man made, and bade this > world good-night. :His Vertious Life fear'd not Mortality, :His body must, > his Vertues cannot die, :Because his Bloud was there so nobly spent, :This > is his Tombe; that Church his Monument. ::Ricardus Boles, Wiltoniensis in > Art. Mag. :::Composuit Posuitque Dolens. An. Domi 1679. Aftermath alt=Archaeological finds from the Battle of Alton, on display in the Church of St Lawrence alt=Musket holes still visible in the south door of the Church of St. Lawrence During and after the battle, Waller captured at least 500 men, around 100 of these re-enlisting with him. Additionally, more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed. Together, the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton's infantry forces in the south. Waller, on the other hand, lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success. Waller put his prisoners to work dragging the horse carcasses from the church, dismantling the scaffoldings inside, and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building. All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs. Waller ordered his men to demolish the town's fortifications, and had survivors that did not re-enlist paraded through the streets of London to mark his victory. Crawford's hat, cloak and gifted wine were all left behind in Alton. From then on, it was said that Crawford, in fleeing, \\"left his sack at Alton\\". King Charles, upon hearing of Boles's death, called for a mourning scarf, lamenting at the loss of what he considered to be one of \\"the best Commanders in this Kingdome\\". In the following weeks, letters were sent from Crawford and Hopton to Waller: Sir, your servant, Crawford Winton, 16 December. Ralf Hopton. Hopton was severely depressed by his defeat at Alton, more than seemed appropriate given its military import. On the Parliamentarian side, the morale boost enjoyed by Waller was significant, and on 15 December, the House of Commons of England ordered Sir Arthur Haslerig and Sir Gilbert Gerard to draft a letter to Waller commending him for his success. The Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Alton allowed Waller to advance south-east, and upon Arundel where he began a successful siege on the Royalists garrisoned there. Hopton was unable to break the siege with his few remaining foot soldiers, and the 1,000 horse he received from Oxford were unhelpful. After the Siege of Arundel, both armies were forced to retire for the winter due to the harsh weather.

Since the 2018 season, touchbacks have also been awarded in college football on kickoffs that end in a fair catch by the receiving team between its own 25-yard line and goal line. Such impetus may be imparted by a kick, pass, fumble, or in certain instances by batting the ball. A touchback is not a play, but a result of events that may occur during a play. A touchback is the opposite of a safety with regard to impetus since a safety is scored when the defending team is responsible for the ball becoming dead on or behind its own goal line. Situations resulting in a touchback Examples of instances where a touchback would be awarded include when: * A kickoff or punt enters the end zone and is downed by the receiving team without the ball being advanced beyond the goal line. Thus, a player on the receiving team could attempt to advance the ball out of his own end zone, but the original impetus from the kick remains as long as the ball does not completely cross the goal line into the field of play. If a kick is fielded by the receiving team in its end zone, is advanced beyond the goal line, and then the ball carrier retreats back into his own end zone where the ball is downed, it is a safety. If a member of the kicking team recovers a kickoff in the end zone, the play is ruled as a touchdown. * In college football, any kickoff that ends in a fair catch by the receiving team inside its own 25-yard line. * In high school football, any kicked ball that crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is a successful field goal. * A kickoff or punt touches the ground in the receiving team's end zone before being touched by a player of the receiving team. If a kicked-off ball goes into the end zone and then is recovered by a member of the kicking team, it is a touchdown for the kicking team, when the ball is touched by the receivers. * A kickoff or punt goes out of bounds behind or over the receiving team's goal line or touches the goal posts or crossbar (and does not score a field goal). * A ball carrier fumbles the ball within the field of play forward into his opponent's end zone and the loose ball then goes out of bounds behind or above his opponent's goal line, is recovered and downed by an opposing player in the end zone, or touches the pylon. The opposing team would be awarded the touchback. * A defensive player intercepts a forward pass in his own end zone and the ball becomes dead behind or over the goal line. Like the instance of a kickoff or punt fielded in an end zone, the intercepting player can attempt to advance the ball but it is still a touchback as long as the ball never completely crosses the goal line into the field of play before it is downed. * A blocked punt goes back into the end zone and the defensive team intentionally bats or kicks the ball out the back of the end zone. Offense must decline penalty. American football In standard outdoor American football, the team awarded the touchback receives possession of the ball at either its own 20-yard line or 25-yard line, depending on the specific type of play. The spot is the 25-yard line in both college and professional football on kickoffs and free kicks after a safety, with the NCAA having changed from the 20 in 2012 and the NFL making the same change in . The NCAA made a further rule change effective in its 2018 season, treating a fair catch on a kickoff, or free kick following a safety, between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line as a touchback. All other touchback situations in both rule sets result in possession at the 20. In high school football, all touchbacks are spotted on the 20 except in Texas, which bases its high school rules on the NCAA rule set. In arena football, and other indoor football games, a touchback results in the team awarded the touchback receiving the football at its own 3-yard line. This can result from any of the above events except for punting, which is not a part of arena football. (In arena football, a kicked ball usually bounces back into play off of the rebound nets, but the above can still occur when the ball lands in the slack nets behind the goalposts after a kickoff, passes under the rebound nets and out of play, or in the event of fumbles and interceptions.) If a defensive player gains possession of the ball during a play between his own five-yard line and goal line and the player's original momentum carries him into the end zone, there is no touchback. Instead, the ball is dead at the point where possession changed. In the National Football League, this rule applies regardless of whether possession is gained inside the five-yard line. Canadian football In Canadian football the term touchback is not used. The failure to advance a kicked ball out of the goal area results in a single point being scored by the kickers, as well as possession by the receivers at their 35-yard line or at the point the ball was kicked from. A turn-over by fumble or interception in the defense's goal area that is not advanced back into the field of play, or a kickoff untouched out of bounds in the end zone, or a kick that touches the goal posts, crossbar, or goal assembly results in a scrimmage on the 25-yard line with no points awarded. If a player's momentum causes the ball to be in the end zone, the ball is treated as if it was recovered in the end zone. Six- and eight-man football For high schools which play six-man football and eight-man football on an 80-yard long field, a touchback is brought out to the 15-yard line. Differences A special rule applies in college football and the NFL with regard to field goal attempts. If a missed field goal occurs in these leagues, the spot at which the non-kicking team receives possession of the ball depends on the spot from which the ball had been kicked. In NCAA football, the ball will be placed either on the 20 or the line of scrimmage of the play in which the attempt was made; in the NFL, either the 20 or the place from which the ball was kicked. (In either case, the ball goes to the spot which is further from the goal line.) The purpose of this rule is to discourage low-percentage, long-range field goal attempts and to deemphasize the advantage which can accrue when only one team has a kicker who has a reasonable possibility of success from a great distance. In American high school football (except in Texas), the missed field goal, regardless of where attempted on the field, results in a touchback as long as the attempt breaks the plane of the goal line, and in arena football, the field goal is treated as if it were a punt.

Skardu is located in the wide by long Skardu Valley, at the confluence of the Indus and Shigar Rivers at an elevation of nearly . The city is an important gateway to the eight-thousanders of the nearby Karakoram Mountain range. The town is located on the Indus river, which separates the Karakoram Range from the Himalayas. Etymology The name \\"Skardu\\" is believed to be derived from the Balti word meaning \\"a low land between two high places.\\" The two referenced ‚Äúhigh places\\" are Shigar city, and the high-altitude Satpara Lake The first mention of Skardu dates to the first half of the 16th century. Mirza Haidar (1499‚Äì1551) described Askardu in the 16th-century text Tarikh-i-Rashidi Baltistan as one of the districts of the area. The first mention of Skardu in European literature was made by Frenchman Fran√ßois Bernier (1625‚Äì1688), who mentions the city by the name of Eskerdou. After his mention, Skardu was quickly drawn into Asian maps produced in Europe, and was first mentioned as Eskerdow the map \\"Indiae orientalis nec non insularum adiacentium nova descriptio\\" by Dutch engraver Nicolaes Visscher II, published between 1680‚Äì1700.  History  = Early history = The Manthal Buddha Rock dates from the era when the region's population was Buddhist. Deosai Plains form the world's second highest alpine plain. The Skardu region was part of the cultural sphere of Buddhist Tibet since the founding of the Tibetan Empire under Songsten Gampo in the mid 7th-century CE. Tibetan tantric scriptures were found all over Baltistan until about the 9th century. Given the region's close proximity to Central Asia, Skardu remained in contact with tribes near Kashgar, in what is now China's westernmost province of Xinjiang. Following the dissolution of Tibetan suzerainty over Baltistan around the 9th-10th century CE, Baltistan came under control of the local Maqpon Dynasty, a dynasty of Turkic extraction, which according to local tradition, is said to have been founded after a migrant from Kashmir named Ibrahim Shah married a local princess. = Maqpon period = Skardu was founded around the year 1500 along the Indus River where it enters a broad valley at its confluence with the Shigar River. Around the year 1500, Maqpon Bokha was crowned ruler, and founded the city of Skardu as his capital. The Skardu Fort was established around this time. During his reign, King Makpon Bokha imported craftsmen to Skardu from Kashmir and Chilas to help develop the area's economy. While nearby Gilgit fell out of the orbit of Tibetan influence, Skardu's Baltistan region remained connected due to its close proximity to Ladakh, the region which Skardu and neighbouring Khaplu routinely fought against. Sikhs traditionally believe that Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, visited Skardu during his second udasi journey between 1510 and 1515. = Mughal period = In the early 1500s, Sultan Said Khan of the Timurid Yarkent Khanate, based in what is now Xinjiang province of China, raided Skardu and Baltistan. Given the threat illustrated by the Sultan Said's invasion, Mughal attention was roused, prompting the 1586 conquest of Baltistan by the Mughal Emperor Akbar. The local Maqpon rulers pledged allegiance, and from that point onwards beginning with Ali Sher Khan Anchan, the kings of Skardu were mentioned as rulers of Little Tibet in the historiography of the Mughal Empire. Mughal forces again incurred into the region during the reign of Shah Jahan in 1634-6 under the forces of Zafar Khan, in order to settle a dispute to Skardu's throne between Adam Khan, and his elder brother Abdul Khan. It was only after this point, during the rule of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, that Skardu's ruling family was firmly under Mughal control. The ability of the Mughal crown to fund expeditions to territories of marginal value, such as Baltistan, emphasizes the wealth of the Mughal coffers. = Dogra rule = In 1839, Dogra commander Zorawar Singh Kahluria defeated Balti forces in battles at Wanko Pass and Thano Kun plains, clearing his path for invasion of the Skardu valley. He seized Skardu Fort on behalf of the Dogra Kingdom based in Jammu. Singh's forces massacred a large number of the garrison's defenders, and publicly tortured Kahlon Rahim Khan of Chigtan in front of a crowd of local Baltis and their chiefs. Dogra forces failed in their 1841 attempt to conquer Tibet. Following their defeat, Ladakhis rose in rebellion against Dogra rule. Baltis under the leadership of Raja Ahmed Shah soon also rose in rebellion against the Dogras, and so Maharaja Gulab Singh dispatched his commander Wazir Lakhpat to recapture Skardu. His forces were able to convince a guard to betray the garrison by leaving a gate unlocked, thereby allowing Dogra forces to recapture the fort and massacre its Balti defenders. The Raja of the Baltis was forced to pay an annual tribute to the Dogra Maharaja in Jammu, while the fort's provisions were provided for by the Balti Raja. Following the Dogra victory, Muhammad Shah was crowned Raja of Skardu in return for his loyalty to the Jammu crown during the rebellion, and was able to exercise some power under Dogra administration. Military commanders held real governing power in the area until 1851 when Kedaru Thanedar was installed as a civilian administrator of Baltistan. During this time, Skardu and Kargil were governed as a single district. Ladakh would later be joined to the district, while Skardu would serve as the district's winter capital, with Leh as the summer capital, up until 1947. Under the administration of Mehta Mangal between 1875 and 1885, Skardu's Ranbirgarh was built as his headquarters and residence. A cantonment, and various other government buildings were built in Skardu during this period. Sikhs from Punjab were also encouraged to migrate to Skardu in order to set up commercial enterprises during this period. The Sikh population prospered, and continued to grow - eventually also settling in nearby Shigar and Khaplu. = 1947‚Äì48 Kashmir War = DMA, 1986) Skardu at dusk After the Partition of British India, on 22 October 1947, Pakistan launched a tribal invasion of Kashmir by Pashtuns leading to the Maharaja Hari Singh acceding to India. The Gilgit Scouts, under the leadership of Major William Brown, mutinied on 1 November 1948, bringing the Gilgit Agency under the control of Pakistan. Major Aslam Khan took over the command of the Gilgit Scouts, organised a force of some 600 men from the rebels and local recruits, and launched attacks on the remaining parts of the State under Indian control. Skardu was an important target because Aslam Khan felt that Gilgit could be threatened from there. The Skardu garrison defended by a contingent of 6th Jammu and Kashmir Infantry under the command of Col. Sher Jung Thapa. The initial attack was repulsed, but the city fell into the rebel hands. After holding the garrison for 6 months and 3 days, Thapa and his forces surrendered on 14 August 1948, Pakistan's independence day.Harbans Singh, Spare a thought for those defenders of Skardu, The Tribune, 19 August 2015. Geography Skardu's Katpana Lake =Topography= Skardu's Airport is situated at an elevation of above sea level, though the mountain peaks surrounding Skardu reach elevations of . Upstream from Skardu are some of the largest glaciers in the world, including the Baltoro Glacier, Biafo Glacier, and Chogo Lungma Glacier. Some of the surrounding glaciers are surrounded by some of the world's tallest mountains, including K2, the world's second tallest mountain at , Gasherbrum at , and Masherbrum at . The Deosai National Park, the world's second highest alpine plain, is located upstream of Skardu as well. Downstream from Skardu is located the Nanga Parbat mountain at . Skardu is located in a broad valley carved by glaciation. The Skardu Valley, at the confluence of the Indus and Shigar Rivers, is wide by long. Active erosion in the nearby Karakoram Mountains has resulted in enormous deposits of sediment throughout the Skardu valley. Glaciers from the Indus and Shigar valleys broadened the Skardu valley between 3.2 million years ago up to the Holocene approximately 11,700 years ago. =Climate= Cold Desert of Skardu are often covered in snow during winter. Skardu features a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk). The climate of Skardu during the summer is moderated by its mountain setting; the intense heat of lowland Pakistan does not reach it. The mountains block out the summer monsoon, and summer rainfall is thus quite low. However, these mountains result in very severe winter weather. During the April-to-October tourist season, temperatures vary between a maximum of and a minimum (in October) . Temperatures can drop to below in the December-to-January midwinter period. The lowest recorded temperature was on 7 January 1995. =Geology= Skardu is located near the Baltoro Glacier - one of the world's longest outside a polar region. Skardu is located along the Kohistan-Ladakh terrane, formed as a magmatic arch over a Tethyan subduction zone that was later accreted onto the Eurasian Plate. The region has low seismic activity compared to surrounding regions, suggesting that Skardu is located in a passive structural element of the Himalayan thrust. The stone in the Skardu region is Katzara schist, with a Radiometric age of 37 to 105 million years. Numerous complex granitic pegmatites and a few alpine-cleft metamorphic deposits are found in the Shigar Valley and its tributaries. Shigar Valley contains the Main Karokoram Thrust separating the metasediments (chlorite to amphibolite grade) on the Asian plate from the southern volcanoclastic rocks of the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc. Tourism Shangrila lake with adjoining Shangrila resort Skardu, along with Gilgit, is a major tourism, trekking and expedition hub in Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan. The mountainous terrain of the region, which includes four of the world's 14 Eight-thousander peaks, attracts tourists, trekkers and mountaineers from around the world. The main tourist season is from April to October; except at this time, the area can be cut off for extended periods by the snowy, freezing winter weather. =Mountains= Skardu Grand Mosque Accessible from Skardu by road, the nearby Askole and Hushe are the main gateways to the snow-covered peaks including K2, the Gasherbrums, Broad Peak, and the Trango Towers, and to the huge glaciers of Baltoro, Biafo and Trango. This makes Skardu the main tourist and mountaineering base in the area, which has led to the development of a reasonably extensive tourist infrastructure including shops and hotels. The popularity of the region results in high prices, especially during the main trekking season. =Deosai National Park= Treks to the Deosai Plains, the second highest in the world at above sea level, after the Chang Tang in Tibet, either start from or end at Skardu. In the local Balti language, Deosai is called Byarsa ‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω≤‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ω¶‚Äã, meaning 'summer place'. With an area of approximately , the plains extend all the way to Ladakh and provides a habitat for snow leopards, ibex, Tibetan blue bears and wild horses. =Skardu Fort= Skardu Fort was built by Raja Ali Sher at the end of the 16th century, and was home to Skardu's local Rajas Skardu Fort or Kharphocho Fort lies on the eastern face of the Khardrong or Mindoq-Khar (\\"Castle of Queen Mindoq\\") hill above Skardu town. The fort dates from the 8th century CE and contains an old mosque probably dating back to the arrival of Islam in the 16th century CE. The fort provides a panoramic view of Skardu town, the Skardu valley and the Indus River. It was built by Maqpon dynasty rulers of Baltistan. It was a seven-storey building. Mostly local people say that Kharpoocho is made by a ghost as they were servants of the ruler of that time. Kharphocho (Skardu) fort was built on a design similar to that of Leh Palace and the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. The name Kharpochhe means the great fort ‚Äî Khar in Tibetan means castle or fort and Chhe means great. =Shigar Fort= The Shigar Fort is a 400 year old fort in the nearby town of Shigar. Located on the route to the world's second highest mountain, K-2 is Shigar Fort. It is also known as Fong-Khar, which in the local language means the \\"Palace on the Rock\\". The complex at Shigar comprises the 400-year-old fort/palace and two more recent buildings: the \\"Old House\\" and the \\"Garden House\\". The former palace of the Raja of Shigar has been transformed into a 20-room heritage guesthouse, with the grand audience hall serving as a museum of Balti culture and featuring select examples of fine wood-carvings, as well as other heritage objects. =Kachura Lakes= There are two Kachura lakes ‚Äî the less well-known (Upper) Kachura Lake and the more famous Shangrila Lake (\\"Lower Kachura Lake\\"). Shangrila Lake is home to the Shangrila Resort hotel complex (possibly the reason for the lake's alternative name), built in a Chinese style and another popular destination for tourists in Pakistan- administered Kashmir. The resort has a unique restaurant, set up inside the fuselage of an aircraft that crashed nearby. Kachura Lake is famous for its deep blue waters. =Satpara Lake= Satpara Lake is Skardu Valley's main lake. In 2002, the Federal Government decided to build a dam on the Satpara Lake allocating $10 million to the project, in 2004. Progress has, however, been slow. Satpara Lake is from Skardu. Satpara Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in the countryside offering trout fishing and row boating. This lake is the source of Skardu's drinking water. The dam was mostly completed in 2011 and four powerhouse units are operational; the latest started operation in June 2013. Transport Pakistan International Airlines operates one daily flight to Skardu Airport using a Boeing 737-300. =Road= The normal road route into Skardu is via the Karakorum Highway and a Skardu Road (S1) into the Skardu Valley from it. Roads once linked Skardu to Srinagar and Leh, though none are open for cross-LoC travel. Skardu's weather can have adverse effects on transport in and out of the region, as Skardu is often snowbound during the winter months. Roads in and out of Skardu can be blocked for extended periods of time, sometimes leaving air travel as the only feasible alternative. =Air= Skardu Airport is served by a daily direct flight from Islamabad. Air travel in winter is subject to disruption due to the unpredictable winter weather. Infrastructure =Satpara Dam= The Satpara Dam development project on the Satpara Lake was inaugurated in 2003. It was expected to be completed in December 2006; now the development work will be completed in December 2013. It is south of Skardu city and is at an elevation of from mean sea level. The main source of water is melting ice of the Deosai plains during the summer season. Now Satpara Dam provides drinking water to the whole city of Skardu and agricultural water to major areas of Skardu, for example, Gayoul, Newrangha, Khlangranga, Shigari Khurd, etc. It is a multipurpose project, which will produce 17.36 megawatts hydro generation, irrigate of land and provide 13 cusecs drinking water daily to Skardu city.

The book and its title have been controversial since its publication. The novel is a portrayal of life in the \\"great black walled city\\" of Harlem, part of New York City. It describes the interactions of African American intellectuals, political activists, bacchanalian workers, and other Harlem characters. The plot concerns two people, a quiet librarian and an aspiring writer, who try to keep their love alive as racism denies them every opportunity. This roman √† clef became an instant bestseller and served as an informal guide book to Harlem. It also split the black literary community, as some, e.g. Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen, appreciated it, while others like Countee Cullen and W. E. B. Du Bois, regarded it as an \\"affront to the hospitality of black folks\\". The book fuelled a period of \\"Harlemania\\", during which the neighbourhood became en vogue among white people, who then frequented its cabarets and bars. Author By the 1920s, Van Vechten was a noted music and dance critic in New York. Knopf had already published several of his novels by the time Nigger Heaven was conceived. He first became fascinated with Harlem when he read a book by a young black writer, Walter White. He sought out White, who worked for the NAACP, and White introduced him to many black artists, which stimulated Van Vechten's appreciation for the Blues and for Harlem. Van Vechten wrote to Gertrude Stein that, \\"I have passed practically my whole winter in company with Negroes and have succeeded in getting into most of the important sets‚Äù, and told her of his future plans for \\"my negro novel\\". ‚ÄúThis will not be a novel about Negroes in the South or white contacts or lynchings. It will be about NEGROES, as they live now in the new city of Harlem (which is part of New York).‚Äù Synopsis =Title= \\"Nigger heaven\\" was a term used in the 19th century to refer to church balconies, which were segregated for African Americans, as the white members of the congregation sat below. =Plot= The short novel begins with a prologue about a violent pimp named Scarlet Creeper. The main part of the book is structured as two novellas. The first is centered on Mary Love, a young librarian, who is fascinated by the diverse cultures of Harlem in which she lives, as well as its different hierarchies, and wants to belong but is unsure of her place in it. She briefly has a relationship with a writer named Byron Kasson and they have extended conversations on literature and art. The second novella is Byron's story. He greatly resents the segregated nature of New York. After his relationship with Mary, he takes up with a debauched socialite as they explore the wild-side of Harlem. The socialite dumps him adding to his earlier negative views on the society in which they live. The novel ends with a violent confrontation involving Scarlet and Byron; while Scarlet is at fault, Byron faces punishment for it. Reception The book, due in part to the inclusion of the pejorative \\"nigger\\" in its title, was met with mixed reception. It was initially banned in Boston. Van Vechten's own father was said to have written his son two letters imploring that he change the title to something less offensive. Van Vechten discussed the title with poet Countee Cullen, who was enraged by it, and they had several arguments over it. According to reviewer Kelefa Sanneh, one interpretation is that because Van Vechten had cultivated many professional and personal relationships in Harlem, he felt he, a white man, had licence to use the pejorative, but Van Vechten also suggested that he knew most would still be offended and not forgive him. Van Vechten was not averse to having the controversy serve as publicity, and he knew at least some in Harlem would defend him. The ambivalence about the book, its title, and what it signifies about the author, has continued into the 21st century. According to Sennah, Van Vechten meant the book to be a celebration of Harlem, but the title expressed the ambivalence about the place in the context of a largely segregated society. Van Vetchen put the titular expression in the dialogue of one of his characters, who explained that the denizens of Harlem were stuck in the balcony of New York City, while the whites in the \\"good seats\\" downtown only occasionally and cruelly acknowledged them to laugh or sneer, but not to know them. Despite central characters who were young, cultured, and black, many early reviews of the novel \\"focused on the supposed 'immorality' of the novel, the naked presentation of sex and crime.\\" W. E. B. Du Bois attacked the novel in an article published in The Crisis, the official magazine of the NAACP, upon its publication. He later addressed the text in depth in the essay \\"On Carl Van Vechten's Nigger Heaven\\", where he called the novel \\"an affront to the hospitality of black folk and to the intelligence of white.\\" Conversely, other prominent African-American reviews, such as that of James Weldon Johnson, which appeared in Opportunity, the official journal of the National Urban League, lauded the text. Wallace Thurman condemned both the text and the reaction to it. According to him, the novel wavers between sophistication and sentimentality but sentimentality regrettably wins out‚Äîhowever, the \\"sting\\" of the book \\"to certain Negroes\\" is also not praiseworthy. Van Vechten's friend and poet, Langston Hughes would go on to write poems to replace the songs used in the original manuscript and in the first printings of the text. Opinions of the novel also diverged along racial lines. Many white critics of the time had little to compare Nigger Heaven to, and viewed the novel as an enlightening, forward-minded text. The controversy cast a long shadow over the reputation of its author. Ralph Ellison condemned both the book and the author in the 1950s. Historian of the Harlem Renaissance, David Levering Lewis, found the book at best quaint, but calls it a \\"colossal fraud\\", with Van Vechten's motives being a ‚Äúa mixture of commercialism and patronizing sympathy.‚Äù Indeed, the book was successfully marketed to whites to exploit their fascination with the other side of town. Later biographers, Emily Bernard (who nonetheless calls the title an \\"open wound\\"), and especially Edward White are more admiring of what Van Vechten attempted to do in crossing boundaries.

It would move the A303 into a tunnel under the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, completing the removal of traffic begun with the closure of the A344 road. The wider project was designed to improve the landscape around the monument and to improve safety on the A303, and was part of proposals to change the site in other ways including moving the visitors centre. Context The A303 road passing by Stonehenge The A303 primary route is one of the main routes from London to the South West of England. Sections have been upgraded to dual carriageway status, though one third of the road remains single carriageway. Traffic flows on the A303 between Amesbury and Winterbourne Stoke (the section including Stonehenge) are above the capacity of the road and the Highways Agency expressed concern about safety on this road and the A344. The two roads passed through Stonehenge and land owned by the National Trust with the A303 passing directly south and the A344 directly to the north, with a pedestrian tunnel passing from the Stonehenge visitor centre to the site underneath this road. As part of the development of the proposals, over 50 routes were considered by the Highways Agency. Since 1991, 51 proposals have been considered for improving the A303 in the area and to remove it from the Stonehenge site. Proposals =1995 proposal= In 1995 it was proposed to build a tunnel for the A303 underneath the World Heritage Site. A conference agreed on a 2.5-mile (4 km) bored tunnel; however, the government instead proposed a cut and cover tunnel, with plans being published in 1999. These plans were criticised by the National Trust, Transport 2000 and others who expressed concern that it would cause damage to archaeological remains along the route, destroy ancient sites and not achieve an improvement in the landscape. In 2002, new plans for a bored tunnel of 1.3 miles (2.1 km) were announced by the Secretary of State for Transport as part of a 7.7-mile (12.5 km) plan to upgrade the A303 to dual carriageway status, with the tunnel estimated to cost ¬£183 million. This proposal brought further protests from the National Trust, English Heritage, UNESCO, CPRE, the Council for British Archaeology and local groups as the tunnel approach cutting would cut in two a prehistoric track way between Stonehenge and a nearby river. These groups are calling for a tunnel at least 2.9 km long, which would, while being sited within the world heritage site, clear most of the known major artefacts, claiming that if the government goes ahead with the 2.1 km tunnel there may never be another chance to remove the road from the site completely. In 2004 a public enquiry required under the Highways Act 1980 was conducted by a planning inspector, Michael Ellison. His enquiry agreed that the government proposals were adequate. The report stated: but concluded: On 20 July 2005 the tunnel scheme was withdrawn by the Government, partly due to rising costs of construction, which had doubled to ¬£470 million. The Highways Agency continued to list the project as planned, but gave 2008 as the earliest date for the start of construction. =2005 proposal= On 31 October 2005 a Government steering group was set up to look at possible solutions, with the aim of choosing an \\"option in keeping with the special requirements of the location that is affordable, realistic and deliverable.\\" The review presented five options ‚Äì the published tunnel scheme, a cut and cover tunnel, a 'partial solution' (involving a roundabout but maintaining the current road), and two overland bypass routes. Some of these plans have been criticised as being damaging to both archaeology and biodiversity, including the stone curlew, barn owls, bats, and the chalk grassland habitat. Five options were considered including diverting the A303 further away and only closing the A344. The group expected to produce a report in 2006, taking into account the results of public consultation which started on 23 January 2006 and ran until 24 April 2006. On 6 December 2007, Roads Minister Tom Harris announced that the whole scheme had been cancelled due to increased costs of ¬£540 million. English Heritage expressed disappointment whilst the group Save Stonehenge (now Stonehenge Alliance) were pleased with the outcome. The Highways Agency stated that they would continue to work on small scale improvements to the A303. =A344 closure= A revised proposal, of closing the A344 road between Stonehenge Bottom and Byway 12, and closing part of the B3086 was put forward in 2010. This also included a proposed new roundabout to replace the current Airman's Corner junction and improvements to the Longbarrow Roundabout on the A303. A planning inquiry to consider the proposal was started in June 2011. In July 2012 work began on the ¬£27 million project which involved the closure and grassing over of part of the A344 and the closing of the underpass beneath the road at the monument entrance. In December 2013 the new visitors' centre at Airman's Corner on the A360 was opened. Shuttle buses take visitors to the monument along the old A344 road, a distance of approximately 2.4 km. =2013 proposal= According to documentation released in response to a Freedom of Information request, in January 2012 local councils and the South West Local Enterprise Partnership met to discuss their proposals for \\"a consortium of Local Authorities to develop and take forward a new scheme for improvements to the A303/ A358/A30\\" and to \\"develop an effective lobbying framework so that we can take a planned approach to raising our profile both nationally, regionally and locally\\". In September 2012 a survey conducted by Somerset County Council found that more than 90% of commuters and businesses in the South West back an upgrade of the A303. In April 2013 it was reported that the chancellor was giving consideration to \\"...adding lanes to the A303 ‚Äì known all too well to holidaymakers ‚Äì which runs from Basingstoke through Wiltshire (past Stonehenge) and Somerset to the South West of England...\\" =2017 go-ahead= The proposal was finally allowed by the Government on 12 January 2017. The Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, said that \\"it will transform the A303, cutting congestion and improving journey times\\". Chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, Andy Rhind-Tutt, described the tunnel plan as a \\"self- destructing time bomb\\" which would \\"do nothing\\" for traffic problems in the area. The Stonehenge Alliance campaign group repeated their belief that \\"any tunnel shorter than 2.7 miles would cause irreparable damage to the landscape\\". The group also responded with a statement: Highways England held consultations on the scheme in 2018. A cost of ¬£1.6 billion and a planned start date in 2021 were indicated. English Heritage, the National Trust and Historic England are quoted as supporting the concept of the tunnel with some concerns about the linking of byways, whilst the Stonehenge Alliance and Friends of the Earth remain opposed, as are the Campaign for Better Transport. In 2020 Chancellor Rishi Sunak greenlighted the tunnel project, but this has now been held up due to archaeological discoveries in the area of Durrington Wells. The Stonehenge Alliance believes that this will cause irreparable damage in breach of the World Heritage Convention. In spite of this Salisbury MP John Glen has stated his belief that the project will go ahead from November.

Fluidics, or fluidic logic, is the use of a fluid to perform analog or digital operations similar to those performed with electronics. The physical basis of fluidics is pneumatics and hydraulics, based on the theoretical foundation of fluid dynamics. The term fluidics is normally used when devices have no moving parts, so ordinary hydraulic components such as hydraulic cylinders and spool valves are not considered or referred to as fluidic devices. A jet of fluid can be deflected by a weaker jet striking it at the side. This provides nonlinear amplification, similar to the transistor used in electronic digital logic. It is used mostly in environments where electronic digital logic would be unreliable, as in systems exposed to high levels of electromagnetic interference or ionizing radiation. Nanotechnology considers fluidics as one of its instruments. In this domain, effects such as fluid‚Äìsolid and fluid‚Äìfluid interface forces are often highly significant. Fluidics have also been used for military applications.  History  In 1957, Billy M. Horton of the Harry Diamond Laboratories (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory) first came up with the idea for the fluidic amplifier when he realized that he could redirect the direction of flue gases using a small bellows. He proposed a theory on stream interaction, stating that one can achieve amplification by deflecting a stream of fluid with a different stream of fluid. In 1959, Horton and his associates, Dr. R. E. Bowles and Ray Warren, constructed a family of working vortex amplifiers out of soap, linoleum, and wood. Their published result caught the attention of several major industries and created a surge of interest in applying fluidics (then called fluid amplification) to sophisticated control systems, which lasted throughout the 1960s. Horton is credited for developing the first fluid amplifier control device and launching the field of fluidics. In 1961, Horton, Warren, and Bowles were among the 27 recipients to receive the first Army Research and Development Achievement Award for developing the fluid amplifier control device.  Logic elements  Logic gates can be built that use water instead of electricity to power the gating function. These are reliant on being positioned in one orientation to perform correctly. An OR gate is simply two pipes being merged, and a NOT gate (inverter) consists of \\"A\\" deflecting a supply stream to produce ƒÄ. The AND and XOR gates are sketched in the diagram. An inverter could also be implemented with the XOR gate, as A XOR 1 = ƒÄ. Another kind of fluidic logic is bubble logic. Bubble logic gates conserve the number of bits entering and exiting the device, because bubbles are neither produced nor destroyed in the logic operation, analogous to billiard-ball computer gates.  Components  A video simulating the internal flow of a fluidic feedback oscillator. = Amplifiers = Fluidic amplifier, showing flow in both states, from . In a fluidic amplifier, a fluid supply, which may be air, water, or hydraulic fluid, enters at the bottom. Pressure applied to the control ports C1 or C2 deflects the stream, so that it exits via either port O1 or O2. The stream entering the control ports may be much weaker than the stream being deflected, so the device has gain. This basic device can be used to construct other fluidic logic elements, as well fluidic oscillators that can be used in analogous way as flip flops. Simple systems of digital logic can thus be built. Fluidic amplifiers typically have bandwidths in the low kilohertz range, so systems built from them are quite slow compared to electronic devices. = Triodes = The fluidic triode is an amplification device that uses a fluid to convey the signal. The fluidic triode was invented in 1962 by Murray O. Meetze, Jr., a high school student in Heath Springs, S.C who also built a fluid diode, a fluid oscillator and a variety of hydraulic \\"circuits,\\" including one that has no electronic counterpart. Fluidic triodes were used as the final stage in the main Public Address system at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Although much studied in the laboratory they have few practical applications. Many expect them to be key elements of nanotechnology.  Uses  The MONIAC Computer built in 1949 was a fluid-based analogue computer used for teaching economic principles as it could recreate complex simulations that digital computers could not. Twelve to fourteen were built and acquired by businesses and teaching establishments. The FLODAC Computer was built in 1964 as a proof of concept fluid digital computer. Fluidic components appear in some hydraulic and pneumatic systems, including some automotive automatic transmissions. As digital logic has become more accepted in industrial control, the role of fluidics in industrial control has declined. In the consumer market, fluidically controlled products are increasing in both popularity and presence, installed in items ranging from toy spray guns through shower heads and hot tub jets; all provide oscillating or pulsating streams of air or water. Fluid logic can be used to create a valve with no moving parts such as in some anaesthetic machines. Fluidic oscillators were used in the design of pressure-triggered, 3D printable, emergency ventilators for the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluidic injection is being researched for use in aircraft to control direction, in two ways: circulation control and thrust vectoring. In both, larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by fluidic systems, in which larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In circulation control, near the trailing edges of wings, aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps and flaperons are replaced by slots which emit fluid flows. In thrust vectoring, in jet engine nozzles, swiveling parts are replaced by slots which inject fluid flows into jets. Such systems divert thrust via fluid effects. Tests show that air forced into a jet engine exhaust stream can deflect thrust up to 15 degrees. In such uses, fluidics is desirable for lower: mass, cost (up to 50% less), drag (up to 15% less during use), inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer or no moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. This will likely be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), 6th generation fighter aircraft, and ships. BAE Systems has tested two fluidically controlled unmanned aircraft, one starting in 2010 named Demon, and another starting in 2017 named MAGMA, with the University of Manchester. Octobot, a proof of concept soft-bodied autonomous robot containing a microfluidic logic circuit, has been developed by researchers at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.

The museum forms part of a former steel-working site on the River Sheaf, with a history going back to at least the 13th century. It consists of a number of dwellings and workshops that were formerly the Abbeydale Works‚Äîa scythe-making plant that was in operation until the 1930s‚Äîand is a remarkably complete example of a 19th-century works. The works are atypical in that much of the production process was completed on the same site (in a similar manner to a modern factory). A more typical example of water-powered works in the area can be found at Shepherd Wheel. The site is a scheduled ancient monument, the works are Grade I listed and the workers' cottages, counting house, and manager's house are Grade II* listed. History Jessop tilt hammer, Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet The site was used for iron forging for 500 years, although there is evidence of other metal working prior to 1200 AD. Its early history is intimately tied with the nearby Beauchief Abbey, which operated a smithy (blacksmith's shop) in the vicinity as well as number of mills along the River Sheaf. A 1725 map shows that the fields, subsequently flooded to provide the dam at the site, had been called \\"Sinder Hills\\", the cinders referring to the waste resulting from prior lead smelting activities in the area in the 16th and early 17th centuries. However, the \\"Abbey Dale Works\\" as such, the buildings of which now form the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet, are first formally recorded in 1714 (though it may have derived directly from the \\"New Wheel\\" operated by Hugh Stephenson, as detailed in rent books from 1685). Development of the site continued with: *1777 enlargement of the dam *1785 construction of the tilt hammer *1793 construction of the workmen's cottages *1817 construction of the grinding hull *1838 construction of the manager's house *1840 construction of the coach house and stabling *1876 construction of the first storey warehouse (above the blacking shop). From the 17th century onwards, the site primarily operated as a scythe works until, in 1933, it was closed by Tyzak Sons and Turner (tenants since 1849). In 1935 it was bought by the Alderman J. G. Graves Trust, which donated the site to the city. The works was briefly reopened during the Second World War to aid in Britain's war effort. The Council for the Conservation of Sheffield Antiquities explored and initiated the restoration of Abbeydale Works in 1964. They discovered the remains of 6 buildings in addition to those still standing. These were identified from a 1924 map of the site as: *a \\"disused hardening shop\\" *a \\"disused open furnace shed\\" *a \\"lime and coke shed\\" *a \\"boiler house and chimney\\" *the \\"housing for the steam engine\\" *a \\"store for clay and anvils\\" Following the complete restoration the works were finally opened as a museum in 1970. Sheffield City Council closed the museum in 1997 as a cost-cutting measure. It was then leased to the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust who reopened the museum in 1998. The museum Water-powered, belt-driven machinery, Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet is run as a working museum, with works and buildings dating from between 1714 and 1876. The museum demonstrates the process making blister steel from iron and coke, then refining this steel using techniques that originated with Benjamin Huntsman's invention of the crucible steel process. The river provides water power via a water wheel. There are several wheels on the site for driving a tilt hammer, for the initial forging of the scythe blades; grinding machinery, which also has steam installed as backup for times of drought, and a set of bellows. The blades were also hand forged for finishing. The museum is open Sunday to Thursday, and entry is ¬£4 for adults, ¬£3 for concessions and free for accompanied children 16 and under.

The station had to be evacuated in January 1956 because of volcanic eruption of Mount Holdgate (so named in 1964) on the neighboring Cook Island to the east. In 1976 it established a military base on Thule Island called Corbeta Uruguay (Port Faraday) in the lee (southern east coast) of the island.

He was introduced in Mortal Kombat II in 1993 as an unpredictable warrior in service of Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. He belongs to a race of nomadic mutants called Tarkatan, later revealed in Mortal Kombat: Deception to be a crossbreed between Netherealm demons and denizens of the wastelands of Outworld. His most distinctive characteristic, like most other members of his race, is a pair of long retractable blades that extend from his forearms. Appearances =In video games= Baraka is first introduced in Mortal Kombat II (1993) as a member of a lowly Outworld race called the Nomads, known for unpredictable behavior and possessing a frequent violent streak. He spearheads the attack on a Shaolin temple in Earthrealm following the conclusion of the first Mortal Kombat tournament, which in turn lures Shaolin monk Liu Kang into Outworld to seek vengeance; as planned by evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. After the Kahn's defeat, Baraka disappeared into Outworld's wastelands, reemerging in the Mortal Kombat Trilogy storyline as a member of Shao Kahn's forces after successfully fighting an \\"uprising renegade race in Outworld's lower regions\\" and took part in the tyrant's ensuing invasion of Earthrealm. However, Shao Kahn is defeated and his takeover plans go for naught a second time, leading to Baraka becoming a drifter once more. While passing through the Outworld realm of Edenia prior to the events of Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), Baraka encountered the sorcerer Quan Chi, who offers him a chance to rule the realm by his side if he agrees to join the fallen Elder God Shinnok's army. Always in the mood for battle, Baraka readily accepts, though he secretly planned to betray his new masters. Following Shinnok's defeat however, Baraka attempted to warn Quan Chi, but the sorcerer pretends to have masterminded the events. After openly balking at the prospect of sharing Outworld's rule, Quan Chi appears to kill Baraka.Mortal Kombat Gold  Baraka's Ending - Kamidogu via YouTube, June 20, 2008. Retrieved February 8, 2004. In Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), Baraka formed an alliance with the risen Dragon King, Onaga, in whose strength he had great faith. When he agreed to follow Onaga, the remainder of his Tarkatan race did so too. Baraka freed the mutant clone Mileena from her prison and recruited her to Onaga's ranks to pose as Edenian Princess Kitana. Mileena used this position to misdirect the Edenian forces into combat against the Tarkatan raiding parties, well away from Onaga, to give the Dragon King the time he needed to complete his schemes. In the Mortal Kombat reboot (2011), which takes place in a new timeline, Baraka appears as a recurring foe in the story mode; wherein he fights and loses to Johnny Cage, Cyrax, Jax, and Jade. When Shao Khan is seemingly killed, he argues that Mileena should be the heir to his throne and leads his Tarkatan armies in an invasion of Earthrealm. Baraka returns in Mortal Kombat X (2015) as a non-playable character. He first appears in a flashback the thunder god Raiden has of the second Mortal Kombat tournament, wherein he and his fellow Tarkatans aided the insectoid D'Vorah in loading captive Shaolin monks before they are confronted and defeated by Raiden, Liu Kang, and Kung Lao. Five years prior to the game's story mode, Baraka served under Empress Mileena alongside D'Vorah. During a meeting with the Osh-Tekk Kotal, Baraka fought the traitorous insectoid after she sided against Mileena, only to be brutally killed. Baraka returns once more in Mortal Kombat 11 after a past version of him was brought to the present by the keeper of time Kronika. After learning of his death and Kotal Kahn rendering the Tarkatans near-extinct, he initially allied himself with Kronika and a similarly time- displaced Shao Kahn. However, Kitana convinces him to aid her in rescuing Kotal by assuring him that she will convince him to treat the Tarkatans with respect. He and the Tarkatans later took part in Kitana's battle against Shao Kahn and in the final battle against Kronika. Design Baraka was first conceived by MK co-creator John Tobias as a \\"savage barbarian demon warrior\\" named Rokuro, as part of the early development process of the first Mortal Kombat, but the concept never made it off the drawing board.John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter, September 14, 2011. Retrieved February 8, 2014. While brainstorming possible character ideas for Mortal Kombat II, several designers visited a local costume shop and found a Nosferatu mask, which they painted in order to enhance its horrifying appearance while attaching silver- painted false fingernails to serve as teeth. This mask was worn by Richard Divizio, the actor who portrayed Baraka in the game. Divizio stated that the mask was a \\"skin-tight\\" fit, and throughout his motion capture filming he was sweating profusely.A video interview on the bonus DVD included with the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception Early Baraka concept art by character designer John Tobias portrayed him as a masked, bald human ninja armed with hookswords. The swords were later used by Kabal - also played by Divizio - in Mortal Kombat 3. Another Baraka concept portrayed him as a creature with extra-long, metal talon-studded, muscular arms, but it was thought this might create an unfair reach advantage and so was re-sketched with blades inspired by the Marvel Comics character Wolverine, whose claws extend from his hands.GamePro 58 (May 1994), p.29, 31. The third and final attempt at a Baraka design included a full head of black hair tied up in a bun, and a large red dot on his belt to go along with his familiar red-and- white tunic and black pants. The red dot, added simply as a decoration, got axed because it was misinterpreted as symbolizing the red dot on the Japanese flag, and the hair was gone shortly thereafter, finalizing Baraka's bald look used throughout the Mortal Kombat series. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, he is seen with a row of spikes projecting off the very back of his head. By the time Mortal Kombat: Deception had released, it was shown that Baraka's race of Tarkatan were all exact duplicates of one another without any significant features to differentiate them. This was slightly fixed in the 2011 installment of Mortal Kombat, as other Tarkatan appear during the game's story and challenge modes that have different, distinguishing features from each other, most notably in the fact that only Baraka uses his bladed arms while other Tarkatans have visible blades. Baraka's special moves and Fatalities tend to involve his blades. His blade became a weapon style in Deception and Armageddon and could also be pulled out for standard attacks in MK vs. DCU. In MKII, Baraka was originally going to be given a move where he spins his blades at the opponent, but were removed from the game before completion, since they were deemed too powerful. He would later have a blade spin move added in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. Mortal Kombat 11 changes the Tarkatan arm blades designs from being sharp metallic blades into much organic looking bone blades. =In other media= Baraka made several appearances in Malibu's' Mortal Kombat comic book series, making his first appearance on the first issue of Goro's miniseries Prince of Pain. Baraka was portrayed as the classic brawn-over-brains type, and had the distinction of speaking in broken English; in the 1993 Midway-created Mortal Kombat II comic book, his only line was \\"Baraka show [Johnny] Cage pain!\\" Baraka was also featured in an eponymous one-shot issue by Malibu Comics in 1995.Malibu Comics' Baraka cover He was also one of numerous characters who habitually referred to themselves in the third person throughout Malibu's entire Mortal Kombat series. Baraka's background is mostly kept in the comic, having him as the leader of the mutants that form part of Shao Kahn's armies. On the following Battlewave series though, he changes sides when Shao Kahn starts replacing his mutants with Scorpion's army of undead soldiers. He ends up joining with Kitana, Kung Lao, and Sub-Zero in a rebel force set to defeat the emperor. Despite this, his violent nature often put him at odds with his former comrades. Lateef Crowder as Baraka in the 2010 short film Mortal Kombat: Rebirth Though the character was not in the first Mortal Kombat film, Shang Tsung's masked footsoldiers therein were referred to as \\"Barakas\\" in the script. Baraka himself was included in the 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and was played by stuntman Dennis Keiffer, but he was never identified by name save for the closing credits, and had no dialogue aside from growling sounds. He attempts to stop Liu Kang from rescuing Kitana, who is imprisoned inside a cage in Shao Kahn's war room; this leads into a brief fight scene that ends with Baraka being kicked off the top of the cage by Liu Kang and sent plummeting to his death into a fire pit. In a continuity violation, an outtake of Rain falling into the pit earlier in the film was used at the end of this scene. Baraka had a greatly expanded role in the script and novelization, in which he partakes in the opening invasion of Earth in place of Rain alongside Kahn's other generals (Sheeva, Ermac, and Motaro), and has an inconclusive fight with Sonya that sees him gain the upper hand before all fighting is halted by Kahn. In an additional scene that was not filmed, he also oversees prisoners slaving away in an Outworld cobalt mine, where Kitana is held captive. The fight scene with Liu Kang is longer and more detailed, and Baraka is killed when he is crushed by Kitana's cage (a fate instead suffered by Sheeva in the film). He spoke his dialogue therein in complete sentences, in contrast to his speech pattern in the comics. Baraka was heavily promoted during and after the release of Mortal Kombat: Deception. There was a special edition of the game only for Xbox featuring his likeness, and a promotional metal card with his biography.Midway Announces Limited Edition Mortal Kombat: Deception; Bonus Features to Include Exclusive Character Videos, Limited Trading Cards and More. There were also two controllers: one for Xbox and one for PlayStation 2, displaying one of his Fatalities. Baraka appeared in director Kevin Tancharoen's 2010 short film Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, and in compliance with the film's grittier contemporary setting, his origin was changed into his being a former plastic surgeon named Alan Zane. After accidentally killing a patient, Zane goes psychotic and murders over two dozen more, then proceeds to mutilate his face with numerous piercings, file down his teeth, and attach a pair of long metal blades to his forearms, in addition to sporting long dreadlocks. He was played by Brazilian martial artist and stuntman Lateef Crowder. Both the design and storyline for the character were not carried over into Tancharoen's Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series, in which Baraka was reverted to his original Outworld origins. Canadian actor and stuntman Fraser Aitcheson replaced Crowder for a one-episode appearance in the 2011 first season, and the first image of his take on the character was published online by The New York Times. Reception Baraka ranked third on GameDaily's ugliest game characters list and as 12th on their list of \\"top baldies\\". GamePlayBook listed Baraka as the fourth best Mortal Kombat character, citing his devastating arms and Fatalities. Cheat Code Central ranked Baraka as the tenth best Mortal Kombat character, commenting \\"I'm sorry, but there's just nothing not cool about that\\" when talking about the blade protruding from his arms. Game Rant placed Baraka as the eighth best character in the series, adding \\"what the mutant lacked in good looks, he easily made up for with satisfying moves\\" and considered him to be the weirdest character in MKII. In UGO Networks' 2012 list of the top Mortal Kombat characters, Baraka placed as seventh, praised for his blades and Fatalities. Sega Visions said of the character in 1994, \\"For pure ugliness and a bad attitude, Baraka can't be beat.\\"Sega Visions August/September 1994, p. 25 Baraka's \\"Lift'em-up\\" Fatality in Mortal Kombat Trilogy was given the 3rd place \\"That's Gotta Hurt\\" Award in Nintendo Power Awards '96.Nintendo Power #96 (May 1997) Game Informer listed Baraka as one of the characters they wanted to see in MK 2011 as \\"people love Baraka\\" but he has been absent from many MK titles ever since his debut.

E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia). He was also involved in promoting the Cinerama widescreen system. In 1954, he led a group of New York City-based investors to buy majority control of Hudson Valley Broadcasting, which, in 1957, became Capital Cities Television Corporation. Early life Thomas was born in Woodington, Darke County, Ohio, to Harry and Harriet (n√©e Wagoner) Thomas. His father was a doctor, his mother a teacher. In 1900, the family moved to the mining town of Victor, Colorado. Thomas worked there as a gold miner, a cook, and a reporter on the newspaper. Thomas' boyhood home in Victor, Colorado In 1911, Thomas graduated from Victor High School where one of his teachers was Mabel Barbee Lee.Lee, Mabel Barbee: \\"Cripple Creek Days\\", pg. 265. Doubleday & Company, 1958 (LOC=58-12050) The following year, he graduated from Valparaiso University with bachelor's degrees in education and science. The next year, he received both a B.A. and an M.A. from the University of Denver and began work for the Chicago Journal, writing for it until 1914. Thomas also was on the faculty of Chicago-Kent College of Law (now part of Illinois Institute of Technology), where he taught oratory from 1912 to 1914. He then went to New Jersey where he studied for a master's at Princeton University (he received the degree in 1916) and again taught oratory at the university. Career Thomas was a relentless self-promoter, and he persuaded railroads to give him free passage in exchange for articles extolling rail travel. When he visited Alaska, he hit upon the idea of the travelogue, movies about faraway places. When the United States entered World War I, President Wilson sent him and others to \\"compile a history of the conflict\\", but the mission was not academic. The war was not popular in the United States, and Thomas was sent to find material that would encourage the American people to support it. He did not want to merely write about the war, he wanted to film it. =Lawrence of Arabia= Thomas in Arabia 1918 Thomas and cameraman Harry Chase first went to the Western Front, but the trenches had little to inspire the American public. They then went to Italy where he heard of General Allenby's campaign against the Ottoman Empire in Palestine. Thomas traveled to Palestine as an accredited war correspondent with the permission of the British Foreign Office, where he met T. E. Lawrence, a captain in the British Army stationed in Jerusalem. Lawrence was spending ¬£200,000 a month encouraging the inhabitants of Palestine to rebel against the Turks. Thomas and Chase spent several weeks with him in the desert, although Lawrence had told them that it would be \\"several days.\\" Lawrence agreed to provide Thomas with material on the condition that Thomas also photographed and interviewed Arab leaders such as Emir Feisal. Thomas shot dramatic footage of Lawrence, then returned to America and began giving public lectures in 1919 on the war in Palestine, \\"supported by moving pictures of veiled women, Arabs in their picturesque robes, camels and dashing Bedouin cavalry\\". His lectures were very popular and audiences were large, and he \\"took the nation by storm\\" in the words of one modern biographer. He agreed to take the lecture to England, but only \\"if asked by the King and given Drury Lane or Covent Garden\\" as a lecture venue. His conditions were met, and he opened a series at Covent Garden on August 14, 1919. \\"And so followed a series of some hundreds of lecture‚Äìfilm shows, attended by the highest in the land\\".Hall, Rex (1975) The Desert Hath Pearls, (Melbourne: Hawthorn Press) pp. 120‚Äì1 At the opening of his six-month London run, there were incense braziers, exotically dressed women dancing before images of the Pyramids, and the band of the Welsh Guards playing to provide the accompaniment. Lawrence saw the show several times; he later claimed to dislike it, but it generated valuable publicity for his own book. To strengthen the emphasis on Lawrence in the show, Thomas needed more photographs of him than Chase had taken in 1918. Lawrence claimed to be shy of publicity, but he agreed to a series of posed portraits in Arab dress in London. Thomas genuinely admired Lawrence and continued to defend him against attacks on his reputation.Clio Visualizing History Page, Lowell Thomas and Lawrence of Arabia.\\"A Legacy of Ripples.\\" Accessed 13 August 2012.

He narrated Twentieth Century Fox's Movietone newsreels until 1952, when he went into business with Mike Todd and Merian C. Cooper to exploit Cinerama, a film exhibition format using three projectors and an enormous curved screen with seven-channel surround sound.

Thomas soon changed the focus of the program from his own travels to interesting stories about other people, and by early October 1930, he was also including more news stories. It was that point that the program, which was now on six days a week, moved to the CBS Radio network.Yank Taylor. \\"Radio Review.\\" Chicago Daily Times, October 4, 1930, p. 9 After two years, he switched back to the NBC Radio network but returned to CBS in 1947. He was not an employee of either NBC or CBS, contrary to today's practices, but was employed by the broadcast's sponsor Sunoco. He returned to CBS to take advantage of lower capital-gains tax rates, establishing an independent company to produce the broadcast which he sold to CBS. He hosted the first television news broadcast in 1939 and the first regularly scheduled television news broadcast beginning on February 21, 1940 over W2XBS (now WNBC) New York, which was a camera simulcast of his radio broadcast.http://eyesofageneration.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/02/february-21-1940-tvs-first-regularly-scheduled-news- debuts.jpg FDR in 1936 In the summer of 1940, Thomas anchored a television broadcast of the 1940 Republican National Convention, the first live telecast of a political convention, which was fed from Philadelphia to W2XBS and on to W2XB. He was not actually in Philadelphia but was anchoring the broadcast from a New York studio and merely identifying speakers who addressed the convention. In April 1945, Thomas flew in a normally single-person P-51 Mustang over Berlin while it was being attacked by the Soviet Union, reporting live via radio.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PNlXAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=cfUDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1874%2C4891161 In 1953, Thomas was featured in The Ford 50th Anniversary Show that was broadcast simultaneously on the NBC and CBS television networks. The program was viewed by 60 million persons. Thomas presented a tribute to the classic days of radio. His persistent debt problems were remedied by Thomas' manager/investing partner, Frank Smith who, in 1954, became the President of co-owned Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company, which, in 1957, became Capital Cities Television Corporation. alt= The television news simulcast was a short- lived venture for Thomas, as he favored radio. It was over radio that he presented and commented upon the news for four decades until his retirement in 1976, the longest radio career of anyone in his day, since surpassed by Paul Harvey. His signature sign-on was \\"Good evening, everybody\\" and his sign-off was \\"So long, until tomorrow,\\" phrases that he used as titles for his two volumes of memoirs. Personal life Thomas with his second wife Marianna Munn Thomas' wife Frances often traveled with him. She died in 1975, and he married Marianna Munn in 1977. They embarked on a honeymoon trip that took him to many of his favorite old destinations. She died in Dayton, Ohio on January 28, 2010 after suffering renal failure. Thomas died at his home in Pawling, New York in 1981. He is buried in Christ Church Cemetery. Legacy and honors The communications building at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York is named in honor of Thomas, after he received an honorary degree from the college in 1981.

It is the administrative center of the Bakhchysarai Raion (district), as well as the former capital of the Crimean Khanate. Its main landmark is Hansaray, the only extant palace of the Crimean Khans, currently open to tourists as a museum. Population:  Geography  Bakhchysarai lies in a narrow valley of the river, about 30 Kilometers south-west of Simferopol. History The city in 1856, by Carlo Bossoli. The earliest known artifacts of human provenance found in the valley date from the Mesolithic period. Settlements have existed in the valley since Late Antiquity. The founding of Bakhchysarai was preceded by the Qƒ±rq Yer fortress (modern √áufut Qale), Sala√ßƒ±q, and Eski Yurt ‚Äî these have become incorporated into the urban area of modern Bakhchysarai. Bakhchysarai first appears in historical documents in 1502. In 1532 Sahib I Giray, the Khan of Crimea from 1532 to 1551, established his residence there. From that time it served as the capital of the Crimean Khanate and the center of political and cultural life of the Crimean Tatar people. After several wars with Russia from 1737 (when General Burkhard Christoph von M√ºnnich burnt down the capital of the Khanate) and following the annexation of the Crimean Khanate by the Russian Empire in 1783, Bakhchysarai became an ordinary town, having lost administrative significance. However, it remained the cultural center of the Crimean Tatars for several decades afterward, fostered by Ismail Gaspirali (1851-1914) who founded the local newspaper Terc√ºman in 1883. During the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì56, Bakhchysarai essentially became a hospital town as wounded Russian soldiers from the battlefield were brought in to be treated. The Battle of the Alma, one of the earliest battles of the war, took place not far from the city in 1854. But although the city was close to the front line, the Turks and their European allies never took it, as the port city of Sevastopol was their primary wartime objective. With the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 and the unification of several socialist republics that had been part of the Russian Empire, Bakhchysarai became part of the Soviet Union (established 30 December 1922) in 1922. The S√ºrg√ºn, the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by the Soviets during the Second World War, took place on 18 May 1944 in Bakhchysarai. The expulsion was prompted by accusations that the Tatars had collaborated with the Axis occupiers (1941-1944). Although deportation of some Tatars in Crimea had begun as early as 1860, during the era of the Russian Empire, the S√ºrg√ºn delivered the final blow, as the city was rendered empty of Crimean Tatars. They were not to return to the city until 1989, when Soviet policies relaxed. Bakhchysarai became a part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991. However, it became a de facto part of the Russian Federation when Russian Armed Forces invaded and annexed the city and the whole of Crimea in 2014. Name and associations Spellings of the town's name in different languages include: * original Crimean Tatar: Baƒü√ßasaray * Turkish: Bah√ßesaray * Russian: –ë–∞—Ö—á–∏—Å–∞—Ä–∞–π - Bakhchisaray * Ukrainian: –ë–∞—Ö—á–∏—Å–∞—Ä–∞–π - Bakhchysarai The name comes from Persian bƒÅghche-sarƒÅy, which means the Garden Palace. In Crimean Tatar, baƒü√ßa means \\"garden\\" and saray means \\"palace\\". Russian-speakers associate the town with the Romantic connotations of Alexander Pushkin's poem The Fountain of Bakhchysarai (1822).

Weaver Richard Malcolm Weaver, Jr (March 3, 1910 ‚Äì April 1, 1963) was an American scholar who taught English at the University of Chicago. He is primarily known as an intellectual historian, political philosopher and a mid-20th century conservative and as an authority on modern rhetoric. Weaver was briefly a socialist during his youth, a lapsed leftist intellectual (conservative by the time he was in graduate school), a teacher of composition, a Platonist philosopher, cultural critic, and a theorist of human nature and society. Described by biographer Fred Young as a \\"radical and original thinker\\",Young 4 Weaver's books Ideas Have Consequences and The Ethics of Rhetoric remain influential among conservative theorists and scholars of the American South. Weaver was also associated with a group of scholars who in the 1940s and 1950s promoted traditionalist conservatism. Life Weaver was the eldest of four children born to a middle-class Southern family in Asheville, North Carolina. His father, Richard Sr., owned a livery stable. After the death of her husband during 1915, Carolyn Embry Weaver supported her children by working in her family's department store in her native Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington is the home of the University of Kentucky and of two private colleges. Despite his family's straitened circumstances after the death of his father, Richard Jr. attended a private boarding school and the University of Kentucky. He earned an A.B in English during 1932. The teacher at Kentucky who most influenced him was Francis Galloway. After a year of graduate study at Kentucky, Weaver began a master's degree in English at Vanderbilt University. John Crowe Ransom supervised his thesis, titled The Revolt against Humanism, a critique of the humanism of Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More. Weaver then taught one year at Auburn University and three years at Texas A&M; University. During 1940, Weaver began a Ph.D. in English at Louisiana State University (LSU), whose faculty included the rhetoricians and critics Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, and the conservative political philosopher Eric Voegelin. While at LSU, Weaver spent summers studying at Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the Sorbonne. His Ph.D. was awarded during 1943 for a thesis, supervised first by Arlin Turner then by Cleanth Brooks, titled The Confederate South, 1865-1910: A Study in the Survival of a Mind and a Culture. It was published during 1968, posthumously, with the title The Southern Tradition at Bay. After one year's teaching at North Carolina State University, Weaver joined the English department at the University of Chicago, where he spent the rest of his career,Young 3-4 and where his exceptional teaching earned him that university's Quantrell Award during 1949. During 1957, Weaver published the first article in the inaugural issue of Russell Kirk's Modern Age. Weaver spent his academic summers in a house he purchased in his ancestral Weaverville, North Carolina, very near Asheville. His widowed mother resided there year-round. Weaver traveled between Chicago and Asheville by train. To connect himself with traditional modes of agrarian life, he insisted that the family vegetable garden in Weaverville be plowed by mule. Every August the Weaver family had a reunion which Richard regularly attended and not infrequently addressed. Precocious and bookish from a very young age, Weaver grew up to become \\"one of the most well-educated intellectuals of his era\\".Scotchie 4 Highly self-sufficient and independent, he has been described as \\"solitary and remote\\",Young 1 as a \\"shy little bulldog of a man\\".Nash 84 Lacking close friends, and having few lifelong correspondents other than his Vanderbilt teacher and fellow Agrarian Donald Davidson, Weaver was able to concentrate on his scholarly activities. During 1962, the Young Americans for Freedom gave Weaver an award for \\"service to education and the philosophy of a free society\\".Scotchie x Shortly before his sudden death in Chicago, Weaver accepted an appointment at Vanderbilt University. Dr. Weaver died on April 1, 1963. According to his sister, he died from a cerebral hemorrhage. During 1964, the Intercollegiate Studies InstituteNash 82 created a graduate fellowship in his memory. In 1983, the Rockford Institute established the annual Richard M. Weaver Award for Scholarly Letters. Early influences Weaver strongly believed in preserving and defending what he considered to be traditional Southern principles.Young 8 These principles, such as anti- consumerism and chivalry, were the basis of Weaver's teaching, writing, and speaking. Having been raised with strong moral values, Weaver considered religion as the foundation for family and civilization.Young 21 His appreciation for religion is evident in speeches he gave early while an undergraduate at the Christian Endeavour Society, as well as in his later writings.Young 22 Influenced by his University of Kentucky professors, who were mostly of Midwestern origin and of social democratic inclinations, and by the crisis of the Great Depression, Weaver believed that industrial capitalism had caused a general moral, economic, and intellectual failure in the United States. Hoping initially that socialism would afford an alternative to the prevailing industrialist culture,Young 3 he joined the Kentucky chapter of the American Socialist Party. During 1932 Weaver actively campaigned for Norman Thomas, the standard-bearer of that party. A few years later, he made a financial contribution to the Loyalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. Encounters with intellectuals in coming years, such as Dr. Tricia McMillan, would unsettle his early acceptance of socialism. While completing a thesis for a master's degree in English at Vanderbilt University, Weaver discovered ideas related to the Southern Agrarians there.Young 69 Gradually he began a rejection of socialism and embrace of tradition. He admired and sought to emulate its leader, the \\"doctor of culture\\" John Crowe Ransom.Young 5 The Agrarians wrote passionately about the traditional values of community and the Old South. During 1930, a number of Vanderbilt University faculty and their students, led by Ransom, wrote an Agrarian manifesto, titled I'll Take My Stand.Young 38 Weaver agreed with the group's suspicion of the post-Civil War industrialization of the South.Young 47 He found more congenial Agrarianism's focus on traditionalism and regional cultures than socialism's egalitarian \\"romanticizing\\" of the welfare state.Scotchie 12 Weaver abandoned socialism for Agrarianism only gradually over a number of years; the thinking of his 1934 M.A. thesis was not Agrarian.Young 58 Weaver's Old South The Southern Tradition at Bay, the title under which Weaver's 1943 doctoral dissertation was published in 1968 after his death, surveyed the post-Appomattox literature of the states that were part of the Confederacy. He revealed what he considered its continuities with the antebellum era. Weaver also discussed certain Southerners who dissented from this tradition, such as Walter Hines Page, George Washington Cable, and Henry W. Grady, whom he termed \\"Southern liberals.\\" Weaver identified four traditional Southern characteristics: \\"a feudal theory of society, a code of chivalry, the ancient concept of the gentleman, and a noncreedal faith\\".Young 78 According to him, the Southern feudal system was centered on the legitimate pride a family line derived from linking its name to a piece of land.Young 81 For Weaver, land ownership gave the individual a much needed \\"stability, responsibility, dignity, and sentiment\\".Scotchie 25 However, in his Ideas Have Consequences, Weaver downplayed the materialistic notion of ownership. He asserted that private property was \\"the last metaphysical right\\" of the individual.Nash 100 Southern chivalry and gentlemen's behavior, on the other hand, emphasized a paternalistic personal honor, and decorum over competition and cleverness.Young 83 Weaver claimed that women preferred the romanticized soldier to the materialistic businessman.Scotchie 36 The noncreedal faith that Weaver advocated (he was a nonpracticing Protestant) grew out of what he termed the South's \\"older religiousness.\\"Young 84 The \\"religion\\" emphasized a respect for tradition and nature and for the Anglican/Episcopal church,Young 84-85 the established church in Virginia and south during the colonial era. Weaver agreed with the traditional Christian notion that external science and technology could not save man, who was born a sinner and in need of redemption.Scotchie 21 Weaver believed that the South was the \\"last non- materialist civilization in the Western World.\\"Scotchie 17 Weaver came to advocate a revival of southern traditions as the only cure for a commodity- based capitalism. He believed it was a way to combat the social degradation that he witnessed while he lived in Chicago. Beginnings of theory Weaver gradually came to see himself as the \\"cultural doctor of the South\\" although he made his career in Chicago.Young 5 More specifically, he sought to resist what he saw as America's growing barbarism by teaching his students of the correct way to write, use, and understand language, which connected Weaver with Platonist ideals. Following the tradition of the Socratic dialogues, Weaver taught that misuse of language caused social corruption. That belief led him to criticize jazz as a medium that promoted \\"barbaric impulses\\" because he perceived the idiom as lacking form and rules.Scotchie 46 Weaver's study of American literature emphasized the past, such as the 19th-century culture of New England and the South and the Lincoln-Douglas debates.Young 6 Attempting a true understanding of language, Weaver concentrated on a culture's fundamental beliefs; that is, beliefs that strengthened and educated citizens into a course of action.Young 9 By teaching and studying language, he endeavored to generate a healthier culture that would no longer use language as a tool of lies and persuasion in a \\"prostitution of words.\\"Young 9 Moreover, in a capitalist society, applied science was the \\"sterile opposite\\" of what he saw as redemption, the \\"poetic and ethical vision of life\\".Young 62 Weaver condemned modern media and modern journalism as tools for exploiting the passive viewer. Convinced that ideas, not machines, compelled humanity towards a better future, he gave words precedence over technology.Nash 96 Influenced by the Agrarians' emphasis of poetry, he began writing poetry.Young 76 In a civilized society, poetry allowed one to express personal beliefs that science and technology could not overrule. In Weaver's words, \\"We can will our world.\\"Nash 97 That is, human beings, not mechanical or social forces, can make positive decisions by language that will change their existence. Communitarian individualism In a short speech delivered to the 1950 reunion of the Weaver clan, Weaver criticized urban life in Chicago as follows: \\"the more closely people are crowded together, the less they know one another\\".Address 114 In a comparative study of Randolph of Roanoke and Thoreau, Weaver defined \\"individualism\\" in two ways: 1) \\"studied withdrawal from society\\" (i.e. Thoreau) and 2) \\"political action at the social level\\" (i.e. Randolph).Young 11 Thoreau (according to Weaver) rejected society while Randolph embraced social bonds through politics. Personally opposed to America's centralized political power, Weaver, like Randolph, preferred an individualism that included community.Young 12 \\"Community\\" here refers to a shared identity of values tied to a geographical and spatial location ‚Äì in Weaver's case, the Old South. He concluded that individualism that is founded on community enabled a citizen \\"to know who he was and what he was about\\".Young 12 Without this intimate foundation, citizens seeking individualism would be unable to reach a true, personal identity. More importantly, he believed that people should grant priority to a living community and its well-being, not to individual fulfillment.Scotchie 3 Anti- nominalism In Ideas Have Consequences, Weaver analyzed William of Occam's 14th century notions of nominalist philosophy. In broad terms, nominalism is the idea that \\"universals are not real, only particulars\\".Young 107 Nominalism deprives people of a measure of universal truth, so that each man becomes his own \\"priest and ethics professor\\".Scotchie 5 Weaver deplored this relativism, and believed that modern men were \\"moral idiots, ... incapable of distinguishing between better and worse\\".Nash 89 Weaver viewed America's moral degradation and turn toward commodity-culture as the unwitting consequences of its belief in nominalism. That is, a civilization that no longer believed in universal transcendental values had no moral ambition to understand a higher truth outside of man.Nash 89 The result was a \\"shattered world\\",Young 113 in which truth was unattainable, and freedom only an illusion. Moreover, without a focus on the sort of higher truth that can be found in organized religions, people turned to the more tangible idols of science and materialism. Weaver's ideal society was that of the European Middle Ages, when the Roman Catholic Church gave to all an accurate picture of reality and truth.Nash 94 Nominalism emerged in the late Middle Ages and quickly came to dominate Western thinking. More generally, Weaver felt that the shift from universal truth and transcendental order to individual opinion and industrialism adversely affected the moral health of Americans. Nominalism also undermines the concept of hierarchy, which depends entirely on fundamental truths about people. Weaver, in contrast, believed that hierarchies are necessary. He argued that social, gender, and age-related equality actually undermine stability and order. Believing in \\"natural social groupings\\".Young 112 he claimed that it should be possible to sort people into suitable categories without the envy of equality. Using the hierarchical structure of a family as an example, he thought that family members accept various duties grounded in \\"sentiment\\" and \\"fraternity,\\" not equality and rights.Young 113 Continuing in this direction, he claimed not to understand the feminist movement, which led women to abandon their stronger connection to nature and intuition for a superficial political and economic equality with men.Young 123 Weaver maintained that egalitarianism only promoted \\"[s]uspicion, hostility, and lack of trust and loyalty\\".Toledano 270 Instead, he believed that there must be a center, a transcendent truth on which people could focus and structure their lives. Contrary to what nominalism would suggest, language can be pinned down, can serve as a foundation through which one can \\"find real meaning\\".Young 122 So, those who do not understand language can never find real meaning, which is inordinately tragic. In Weaver's words, \\"a world without generalization would be a world without knowledge\\".Young 114 Thus universals allow true knowledge. Weaver on rhetoric In The Ethics of Rhetoric, Weaver evaluates the ability of rhetoric to persuade. Similarly to ancient philosophers, Weaver found that language has the power to move people to do good, to do evil, or to do nothing at all.Young 129 In his defense of orthodoxy, Weaver set down a number of rhetorical principles. He grounded his definition of \\"noble rhetoric\\" in the work of Plato; such rhetoric aimed to improve intellect by presenting men with \\"better versions of themselves\\".Young 135 He also agreed with Plato's notions of the realities of transcendentals (recall Weaver's hostility to nominalism) and the connection between form and substance.Johannesen 7 For instance, Weaver admired the connection between the forms of poetry and rhetoric. Like poetry, rhetoric relies on the connotation of words as well as their denotation. Good rhetoricians, he asserted, use poetic analogies to relate abstract ideas directly to the listeners.Young 132 Specifically emphasizing metaphor, he found that comparison should be an essential part of the rhetorical process.Johannesen 23 However, arguments from definition‚Äîthat is, from the very nature of things (justice, beauty, the nature of man)  had an even higher ethical status, because they were grounded in essences rather than similarities. Arguments grounded in mere circumstance (\\"I have to quit school because I cannot afford the tuition\\") Weaver viewed as the least ethical, because they grant the immediate facts a higher status than principle. Finally, Weaver pointed out that arguments from authority are only as good as the authority itself.Johannesen 27 In Language is Sermonic, Weaver pointed to rhetoric as a presentation of values. Sermonic language seeks to persuade the listener, and is inherent in all communication. Indeed, the very choice to present arguments from definition instead of from consequence implies that one of the modes of reason carries greater value. He also considered rhetoric and the multiplicity of man. That is, he acknowledged that logic alone was not enough to persuade man, who is \\"a pathetic being, that is, a being feeling and suffering\\".Weaver 1352 He felt that societies that placed great value on technology often became dehumanized. Like a machine relying purely on logic, the rhetorician was in danger of becoming \\"a thinking robot\\".Weaver 1353 Weaver divided the nature of man into four categories: rational, emotional, ethical, and religious.Johannesen 13 Without considering these characteristics as a whole, rhetoricians cannot hope to persuade their listeners. Moreover, when motivating the listener to adopt attitudes and actions, rhetoricians must consider the uniqueness of each audience.Weaver 1351 In other words, orators should acknowledge that each audience has different needs and responses, and must formulate their arguments accordingly. Weaver also divided \\"argumentation\\" into four categories: cause-effect, definition, consequences, and circumstances.Johannesen 27 The rhetorician must decide which method of argument will best persuade a given audience. In his The Ethics of Rhetoric, Weaver coined the phrases \\"god terms\\" and \\"devil terms\\".Young 147-49 \\"God terms\\" are words particular to a certain age and are vague, but have \\"inherent potency\\" in their meanings.Young 147 Such words include progress and freedom ‚Äì words that seem impenetrable and automatically give a phrase positive meaning. In contrast, \\"devil terms\\" are the mirror image, and include words such as Communist and Un-American.Weaver 222-23 Rhetoric, Weaver argued, must employ such terminology only with care. Employing ethical rhetoric is the first step towards rejecting vague terminology with propagandistic value.Johannesen 27 Upon hearing a \\"god\\" or \\"devil\\" term, Weaver suggested that a listener should \\"hold a dialectic with himself\\" to consider the intention behind such persuasive words.Weaver 232 He concluded that \\"a society's health or declension was mirrored in how it used language\\".Young 151 If a language is pure, so too will be those who employ it. Weaver's influence Some regard The Southern Tradition at Bay as Weaver's best work. Ideas Have Consequences is more widely known, thanks to its substantial influence on the \\"postwar intellectual Right\\".Nash 87 The leading young conservative intellectuals of the era, including Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr., and Willmoore Kendall, praised the book for its critical insights.Young 179 Publisher Henry Regnery claims that the book gave the modern conservative movement a strong intellectual foundation.Nash 82 Frank S. Meyer, a libertarian theorist of the 1960s ‚Äì and former Communist Party USA member ‚Äì publicly thanked Weaver for inspiring him to join the Right.Nash 88 For many liberals, Weaver was a misguided authoritarian. For many conservatives, he was a champion of tradition and liberty, with the emphasis on tradition. For Southerners, he was a refreshing defender of an \\"antimodern\\" South.Nash 108 For others he was a historical revisionist. His refutation of what Russell Kirk termed \\"ritualistic liberalism\\"Nash 87 struck a chord with conservative intellectuals. Stemming from a tradition of \\"cultural pessimism\\",Nash 92 his critique of nominalism, however startling, gave conservatives a new philosophical direction. His writing attacked the growing number of modern Americans denying conservative structure and moral uprightness, confronting them with empirical functionalism. During the 1980s, the emerging paleoconservatives adapted his vision of the Old South to express antimodernism.Nash 109 Weaver has come to be seen as defining America's plight and as inspiring conservatives to find \\"the relationship between faith and reason for an age that does not know the meaning of faith\\".Toledano 259 Weaver's personal library is kept at Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan.\\"Mossey Library Collections\\" Retrieved 2019-04-15 See also * Agrarianism * Neo-Confederate * Nominalism * Paleo-conservatism * Problem of universals * Rhetoric ;People * Wendell Berry (b. 1934) * Donald Davidson (1893-1968) * Russell Kirk (1918-1994) * John Crowe Ransom (1888-1974) * Leo Strauss (1899-1973) * Eric Voegelin (1901-1985) Bibliography * 1948.

It was based on the successful Ford Duratec engine rather than its predecessor, the compact Ford SHO V6 engine developed by Yamaha for the 1989 Taurus SHO. The engine was retired in 1999 when production of the third-generation Taurus SHO ended.  3.4 L  The 3.4 L SHO V8 was introduced in the spring of 1996. It incorporated many of the traits of the SHO V6, including the aluminum cylinder heads and 4 valves per cylinder DOHC design, but differed with an aluminum rather than iron block and no variable length intake manifold. A chain is also used to time the camshafts to crankshaft instead of the belts that the SHO V6s used. The SHO V8 has a split port style intake valve setup. The primary valve is exposed all the time and has the fuel injector spraying on it, while the secondary valve is only exposed when the Intake manifold Runner Control opens the secondary plates at 3400 rpm. These secondary valves are called \\"secondaries\\" by SHO enthusiasts. Power was similar too, at and of torque. Bore and stroke were identical to the Duratec 25 at , respectively. The engines shared other traits as well, and insiders report that the designs are related, though not closely. Notably, the two engines share the same bell housing pattern and 60¬∞ V angle. The 60¬∞ angle makes it compact and more suitable for transverse mounting, but it is not ideally balanced‚ÄîV8s are typically 90¬∞‚Äînecessitating the use of a counter- rotating balance shaft. Manufacturing was also a shared process. Ford manufactured the aluminum engine blocks, using a patented Cosworth process, at their Windsor, Ontario plant, then shipped them to Japan for finishing by Yamaha. The finished engines were shipped back to the Taurus plant in Atlanta, Georgia for installation. Unlike the SHO V6, the SHO V8's valvetrain was an \\"interference\\" design, one that is shared by many engines built today, meaning that the piston will collide with the valves if the camshaft or timing chain fails. Due to some cam sprocket failures, the engine acquired a reputation for potentially catastrophic failure. = Cam trouble = Soon after the introduction of the SHO V8 engine, widespread problems with the cam sprockets began to surface. Yamaha had used a relatively unusual method, called \\"swaging\\", of affixing the cam sprockets to the camshafts. The cam sprockets were fastened to the hollow camshafts by forcing a metal ball which was slightly larger than the interior diameter of the camshaft through the center of the camshaft, thus expanding the metal slightly and creating a mechanical bond between the cam sprocket and the camshaft. This method proved to be inadequate, and the cam sprocket could break loose from the camshaft and spin independently from the camshaft (or \\"walk\\"). This would result in the camshaft stopping and thus not activating the valves, allowing the pistons to hit the valves, ruining the engine. The preventive measure of welding the cam sprocket to the camshaft soon proved to be a fix for engines that had not suffered such a fate yet. Another such fix is \\"pinning\\" the cam sprocket, or inserting a pin in the sprocket to keep it aligned on the camshaft. Ford issued a TSB (TSB 03-14-1) prescribing the application of Loctite to the cam sprocket to lengthen the life of the camshafts, but as SHO owners have experienced cam failure after the application of Loctite, most SHO enthusiasts do not recommend this fix.

They consisted of Quasi Modo (Sascha Klammt, DJ) and Textor (Henrik von Holtum, MC). They released their first album in 1994. Their name is both a tribute to the early hip hop group Boogie Down Productions and a reference to the child's play room () in the parental house of von Holtum, in which the first two albums were conceived. In 2007 they announced their disbandment. Nevertheless, in 2019, they have paused their hiatus, releasing a record named 'Es kommt in Wellen'. History Textor's mother, Lena M√∂llerstr√∂m, was a Swedish jazz singer, while his father, G√ºnther von Holtum, was a classically trained drummer, so music was a constant element of daily life in the von Holtum household, leading to a jazz influence which can be heard in many Kinderzimmer Productions tracks. The band's self-titled debut album had to be withdrawn from the market fairly soon after its release. The song \\"Back\\" contained an uncleared sample from the Stranglers' recording \\"Golden Brown\\". The Stranglers had already agreed to the sample being used, but their record company invoked its exclusive rights to it regardless, and the original album can no longer be distributed. It was re-released in 1998 under the name Die Erste, with the uncleared sample in \\"Back\\" replaced by a distinctively off-key piano melody played by Textor. After the first album was withdrawn, Kinderzimmer Productions proceeded more cautiously with the second. In the track \\"Intro\\", a sample of Kate Bush is announced with the words An dieser Stelle stand ein Sample von Kate Bush (\\"At this point there was a sample of Kate Bush\\"). The album itself contains many jazzy samples strongly evocative of the 1930s to 1960s. Style More than with most German hip hop, the tracks are shaped by a dynamic combination of samples (often jazzy or funky, frequently quoting well-known hip hop classics). Textor's sing-speak is marked by high speed, complicated sentence constructions and the occasional use of foreign words and technical terms. In \\"Back\\" Textor sings Wie ich schon sagte, ich schreib meine Zeilen mal widerlich schnell, mal fettig und langsam, mal sinnvoll, mal sinnlos (\\"Like I said, sometimes I write my lines obscenely fast, sometimes slow and flabby, sometimes meaningful, sometimes meaningless\\"). As a special feature on their homepage, users can make their own hip hop tape with words spoken by Textor.

Among the European powers, only France came out with an open protest against this act, due to the longstanding Franco-Ottoman alliance. Naming and geography The map of the Crimean Khanate by Pieter van der Aa, 1707 Crimean khans, considering their state as the heir and legal successor of the Golden Horde and Desht-i Kipchak, called themselves khans of \\"the Great Horde, the Great State and the Throne of the Crimea\\". The full title of the Crimean khans, used in official documents and correspondence with foreign rulers, varying slightly from document to document during the three centuries of the khanate's existence, was as follows: \\"By the Grace and help of the blessed and highest Lord, the great padishah of the Great Horde, and the Great State, and the Throne of the Crimea, and all the Nogai, and the mountain Circassians, and the tats and tavgachs, and The Kipchak steppe and all the Tatars\\" ().Documents of the Crimean khanate from the collection of Huseyn Feyzkhanov / comp. and the transliteration.

Lords of two continents, volume 1, Kiev-Bakhchisaray, 2007 English-speaking writers during the 18th and early 19th centuries often called the territory of the Crimean Khanate and of the Lesser Nogai Horde Little Tartary (or subdivided it as Crim Tartary (also Krim Tartary) and Kuban Tartary). Edmund Spencer, Travels in Circassia, Krim-Tartary &c;: Including a Steam Voyage Down the Danube from Vienna to Constantinople, and Round the Black Sea, Henry Colburn, 1837. The name \\"Little Tartary\\" distinguished the area from (Great) Tartary ‚Äì those areas of central and northern Asia inhabited by Turkic peoples or Tatars. The London-based cartographer Herman Moll in a map of c. 1729 shows \\"Little Tartary\\" as including the Crimean peninsula and the steppe between Dnieper and Mius River as far north as the Dnieper bend and the upper Tor River (a tributary of the Donets). To His Most Serene and August Majesty Peter Alexovitz Absolute Lord of Russia &c.; This map of Moscovy, Poland, Little Tartary, and ye Black Sea &c.; is most Humbly Dedicated by H. Moll Geographer (raremaps.com). The map shows Little Tartary as reaching the left bank of the Dnepr, and as including the Kalmius but not the Mius, to the north reaching as far as the Tor (Torets) basin, somewhat south of Izium. Other geographers (but not Moll) sometimes included in \\"Lesser Tartary\\" the territory of the Lesser Nogai Horde in Kuban, east of the Sea of Azov (in Moll's map labelled separately as Koeban Tartary). The Khanate included the Crimean peninsula and the adjacent steppes, mostly corresponding to the parts of South Ukraine between the Dnieper and the Donets rivers (i.e. including most of present-day Zaporizhia Oblast, left-Dnepr parts of Kherson Oblast, besides minor parts of southeastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and western Donetsk Oblast). The territory controlled by the Crimean Khanate shifted throughout its existence due to the constant incursions by the Cossacks, who had lived along the Don since the disintegration of the Golden Horde in the 15th century. History = Pre- history = The Pontic steppes, The first known Turkic peoples appeared in Crimea in the 6th century, during the conquest of the Crimea by The Turkic Kaganate.The Crimea. Great historical guide. Alexander Andreev publishing house Liters 2014 In the 11th century, Cumans (Kipchaks) appeared in Crimea, who later became the ruling and state-forming people of the Golden Horde and the Crimean Khanate.\\"the Turkic peoples are becoming not only the ruling, but also the state-forming people\\" - the Golden Horde and the Slavs In the middle of the 13th century, the northern steppe lands of the Crimea, inhabited mainly by Turkic peoples ‚Äî Cumans, became the possession of Ulus Juchi, known as the Golden Horde or Ulu Ulus. In this era, the role of Turkic peoples increased.R. I. Kurteev, K. K. Choghoshvili. The ethnic term \\"Tatars\\" and the ethnic group \\"Crimean Tatars\\". - Through the ages: the peoples of the Crimea. Issue 1 \\\\ Ed. N. Nikolaenko-Simferopol: Academy of Humanities, 1995 Since this time, the local Kipchaks took the name of Tatars (tatarlar).see Codex Cumanicus In the Horde period, the khans of the Golden Horde were the Supreme rulers of the Crimea, but their governors ‚Äî Emirs ‚Äî exercised direct control. The first formally recognized ruler in the Crimea is considered Aran-Timur, the nephew of Batu Khan of the Golden Horde, who received this area from Mengu-Timur, and the first center of the Crimea was the ancient city Qƒ±rƒ±m (Solhat). This name then gradually spread to the entire Peninsula. The second center of Crimea was the valley adjacent to Qƒ±rq Yer and Baƒü√ßasaray. Uzbek Khan mosque in Eski Qƒ±rƒ±m (Solhat), built in the Golden Horde period The multi-ethnic population of Crimea then consisted mainly of those who lived in the steppe and foothills of the Peninsula Kipchaks (Cumans), Crimean Greeks, Crimean Goths, Alans, and Armenians, who lived mainly in cities and mountain villages. The Crimean nobility was mostly of both Kipchak and Horden origin. Horde rule for the peoples who inhabited the Crimean Peninsula was, in general, painful. The rulers of the Golden Horde repeatedly organized punitive campaigns in the Crimea, when the local population refused to pay tribute. A well-known campaign of the Nogai Khan in 1299, as a result of which a number of Crimean cities suffered. As in other regions of the Horde, separatist tendencies soon began to manifest themselves in Crimea. In 1303, in Crimea, the most famous written monument of the Kypchak or Cuman language was created (named in Kypchak \\"tatar tili\\") ‚Äî \\"Codex Cumanicus\\", which is the oldest memorial of the Crimean Tatar language and of great importance for the history of Kypchak and Oghuz dialects ‚Äî as directly related to the Kipchaks of the Black Sea steppes and Crimea. D√ºrbe of Canike Hanƒ±m There are legends that in the 14th century, the Crimea was repeatedly ravaged by the army Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Grand Duke of Lithuania Olgerd broke the Tatar army in 1363 near the mouth of the Dnieper, and then invaded the Crimea, devastated Chersonesos and seized valuable church objects there. There is a similar legend about his successor Vitovt, who in 1397 went on a Crimean campaign to Caffa and again destroyed Chersonesos. Vitovt is also known in Crimean history for giving refuge in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to a significant number of Tatars and Karaites, whose descendants now live in Lithuania and Belarus. In 1399 Vitovt, who came to the aid of the Horde Khan Tokhtamysh, was defeated on the banks of the Vorskla River by Tokhtamysh's rival Timur-Kutluk, on whose behalf the Horde was ruled by the Emir Edigei, and made peace. During the reign of Canike Hanƒ±m, Tokhtamysh's doughter, in Qƒ±rq-Or, she supported Hacƒ± I Giray in the struggle against the descendants of Tokhtamysh, Kichi-Muhammada and Sayid Ahmad, who as well as Hacƒ± Giray claimed full power in the Crimea and probably saw him as her heir to the Crimean throne. In the sources of the 16th‚Äî18th centuries, the opinion according to which the separation of the Crimean Tatar state was raised to Tokhtamysh, and Canike was the most important figure in this process, completely prevailed. =Establishment= The Crimean Khanate originated in the early 15th century when certain clans of the Golden Horde Empire ceased their nomadic life in the Desht-i Kipchak (Kypchak Steppes of today's Ukraine and southern Russia) and decided to make Crimea their yurt (homeland). At that time, the Golden Horde of the Mongol empire had governed the Crimean peninsula as an ulus since 1239, with its capital at Qirim (Staryi Krym). The local separatists invited a Genghisid contender for the Golden Horde throne, Hacƒ± Giray, to become their khan. Hacƒ± Giray accepted their invitation and traveled from exile in Lithuania. He warred for independence against the Horde from 1420 to 1441, in the end achieving success. But Hacƒ± Giray then had to fight off internal rivals before he could ascend the throne of the khanate in 1449, after which he moved its capital to Qƒ±rq Yer (today part of Bah√ßeseray).Bakhchisaray history The khanate included the Crimean Peninsula (except the south and southwest coast and ports, controlled by the Republic of Genoa & Trebizond Empire) as well as the adjacent steppe. =Ottoman protectorate= Map of the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire The sons of Hacƒ± I Giray contended against each other to succeed him. The Ottomans intervened and installed one of the sons, Me√±li I Giray, on the throne. Menli I Giray, took the imperial title \\"Sovereign of Two Continents and Khan of Khans of Two Seas.\\" In 1475 the Ottoman forces, under the command of Gedik Ahmet Pasha, conquered the Greek Principality of Theodoro and the Genoese colonies at Cembalo, Soldaia, and Caffa (modern Feodosiya). Thenceforth the khanate was a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman sultan enjoyed veto power over the selection of new Crimean khans. The Empire annexed the Crimean coast but recognized the legitimacy of the khanate rule of the steppes, as the khans were descendants of Genghis Khan. Ottoman campaign in Hungary in 1566, with Crimean Tatars as vanguard In 1475, the Ottomans imprisoned Me√±li I Giray for three years for resisting the invasion. After returning from captivity in Constantinople, he accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Nevertheless, Ottoman sultans treated the khans more as allies than subjects.Khan Palace in Bakhchisaray, The Giray Dynasty , Hansaray Organization The khans continued to have a foreign policy independent from the Ottomans in the steppes of Little Tartary. The khans continued to mint coins and use their names in Friday prayers, two important signs of sovereignty. They did not pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire; instead the Ottomans paid them in return for their services of providing skilled outriders and frontline cavalry in their campaigns.Bennigsen Later on, Crimea lost power in this relationship as the result of a crisis in 1523, during the reign of Me√±li's successor, Mehmed I Giray. He died that year and beginning with his successor, from 1524 on, Crimean khans were appointed by the Sultan. The alliance of the Crimean Tatars and the Ottomans was comparable to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union in its importance and durability. The Crimean cavalry became indispensable for the Ottomans' campaigns against Poland, Hungary, and Persia. =Victory over the Golden Horde= In 1502, Me√±li I Giray defeated the last khan of the Great Horde, which put an end to the Horde's claims on Crimea. The Khanate initially chose as its capital Sala√ßƒ±q near the Qƒ±rq Yer fortress. Later, the capital was moved a short distance to Bah√ßeseray, founded in 1532 by Sahib I Giray. Both Sala√ßƒ±q and the Qƒ±rq Yer fortress today are part of the expanded city of Bah√ßeseray. =Slave trade= The slave trade was the backbone of the economy of the Crimean Khanate.Peter B. Brown, \\"Russian Serfdom's Demise and Russia's Conquest of the Crimean Khanate and the Northern Black Sea Littoral: Was There a Link?\\", in Eurasian Slavery, Ransom and Abolition in World History, 1200‚Äì1860 (Routledge, 2015), p. 346: \\"The slave trade was the backbone of the Crimean khanate's economy.\\"J. Otto Pohl, Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937‚Äì1949 (Greenwood, 1999), p. 110: \\"The slave trade formed the backbone of the Crimean Khanate's economy.\\" However, some historians are of the opinion that the role of the slave trade in the economy of the Crimean Khanate is greatly exaggerated by modern historians, and the raiding economy is nothing but a historical myth.The historical fate of the Crimean Tatars ‚Äî Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor Valery Vozgrin, 1992, Moscow The Crimeans frequently mounted raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland-Lithuania, and Muscovy to enslave people whom they could capture; for each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savƒüa) of 10% or 20%. These campaigns by Crimean forces were either (\\"sojourns\\"), officially declared military operations led by the khans themselves, or √ßapuls (\\"despoiling\\"), raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland- Lithuania over the period 1500‚Äì1700.Darjusz Ko≈Çodziejczyk, as reported by Caffa (an Ottoman city on Crimean peninsula) was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets, although it could not influence Crimean Khanate economics, as Caffa was a part of Ottoman Empire, not Crimean Khanate.Historical survey > Slave societiesCaffa In 1769, a last major Tatar raid resulted in the capture of 20,000 Russian and Ruthenian slaves. Author and historian Brian Glyn Williams writes: Early modern sources are full of descriptions of sufferings of Christian slaves captured by the Crimean Tatars in the course of their raids: =Alliances= Tatars fighting Zaporozhian Cossacks, by J√≥zef Brandt The Crimean Khanate also made alliances with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and the Zaporizhian Sich. The assistance of ƒ∞sl√¢m III Giray during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648 contributed greatly to the initial momentum of military successes for the Cossacks. The relationship with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was also exclusive, as it was the home dynasty of the Girays, who sought sanctuary in Lithuania in the 15th century before establishing themselves on the Crimean peninsula. The northern hinterlands of the khanate were coveted by Muscovy for their agricultural productivity, having longer growing seasons than Muscovy itself. Within Muscovy, the permanent warfare at the borderland and the burgeoning in size of the armies of the nobles (boyars) fomented intense exploitation of the peasantry. =Struggle over Astrakhan= The Crimean Khanate in about 1600. Note that the areas marked Poland and Muscovy were claimed rather than administered and were thinly populated. In the middle of the 16th century, the Crimean Khanate asserted a claim to be the successor to the Golden Horde, which entailed asserting the right of rule over the Tatar khanates of the Caspian-Volga region, particularly the Kazan Khanate and Astrakhan Khanate. This claim pitted it against Muscovy for dominance in the region. A successful campaign by Devlet I Giray upon the Russian capital in 1571 culminated in the burning of Moscow, and he thereby gained the sobriquet, That Alƒüan (seizer of the throne).Moscow - Historical background The following year, however, the Crimean Khanate lost access to the Volga once and for all due to its catastrophic defeat in the Battle at Molodi. =Decline= The Turkish traveler writer Evliya √áelebi mentions the impact of Cossack raids from Azak upon the territories of the Crimean Khanate. These raids ruined trade routes and severely depopulated many important regions. By the time Evliya √áelebi had arrived almost all the towns he visited were affected by the Cossack raids. In fact, the only place Evliya √áelebi considered safe from the Cossacks was the Ottoman fortress at Arabat. Map of the sparsely populated Wild Fields in the 17th century The decline of the Crimean Khanate was a consequence of the weakening of the Ottoman Empire and a change in Eastern Europe's balance of power favouring its neighbours. Crimean Tatars often returned from Ottoman campaigns without booty, and Ottoman subsidies were less likely for unsuccessful campaigns. Without sufficient guns, the Tatar cavalry suffered a significant loss against European and Russian armies with modern equipment. By the late 17th century, Muscovite Russia became too strong a power for Crimea to pillage and the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) outlawed further raids. The era of great slave raids in Russia and Ukraine was over, although brigands and Nogay raiders continued their attacks and Russian hatred of the Khanate did not decrease. These politico-economic losses led in turn to erosion of the khan's support among noble clans, and internal conflicts for power ensued. The Nogays, who provided a significant portion of the Crimean military forces, also took back their support from the khans towards the end of the empire. Skirmish with Tatars, by Maksymilian Gierymski In the first half of 17th century, Kalmyks formed the Kalmyk Khanate in the Lower Volga and under Ayuka Khan conducted many military expeditions against the Crimean Khanate and Nogays. By becoming an important ally and later part of the Russian Empire and taking an oath to protect its southeastern borders, the Kalmyk Khanate took an active part in all Russian war campaigns in 17th and 18th centuries, providing up to 40,000 fully equipped horsemen. The united Russian and Ukrainian forces attacked the Khanate during the Chigirin Campaigns and the Crimean Campaigns. It was during the Russo-Turkish War, 1735-1739 that the Russians, under the command of Field-Marshal M√ºnnich, finally managed to penetrate the Crimean Peninsula itself, burning and destroying everything on their way. More warfare ensued during the reign of Catherine II. The Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774 resulted in the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji, which made the Crimean Khanate independent from the Ottoman Empire and aligned it with the Russian Empire. The rule of the last Crimean khan ≈ûahin Giray was marked with increasing Russian influence and outbursts of violence from the khan administration towards internal opposition. On 8 April 1783, in violation of the treaty (some parts of which had been already violated by Crimeans and Ottomans), Catherine II intervened in the civil war, de facto annexing the whole peninsula as the Taurida Governorate. In 1787, ≈ûahin Giray took refuge in the Ottoman Empire and was eventually executed, on Rhodes, by the Ottoman authorities for betrayal. The royal Giray family survives to this day. Through the 1792 Treaty of Jassy (Ia≈üi), the Russian frontier was extended to the Dniester River and the takeover of Yedisan was complete. The 1812 Treaty of Bucharest transferred Bessarabia to Russian control. Government At the Southern Border of Moscva state by Sergey Vasilievich Ivanov All Khans were from the Giray clan, which traced its right to rule to its descent from Genghis Khan. According to the tradition of the steppes, the ruler was legitimate only if he was of Genghisid royal descent (i.e. \\"ak s√ºyek\\"). Although the Giray dynasty was the symbol of government, the khan actually governed with the participation of Qara√ßƒ± Beys, the leaders of the noble clans such as ≈ûirin, Barƒ±n, Arƒüƒ±n, Qƒ±p√ßaq, and in the later period, Mansuroƒülu and Sicavut. After the collapse of the Astrakhan Khanate in 1556, an important element of the Crimean Khanate were the Nogays, most of whom transferred their allegiance from Astrakhan to Crimea. Circassians (Atteghei) and Cossacks also occasionally played roles in Crimean politics, alternating their allegiance between the khan and the beys. The Nogay pastoral nomads north of the Black Sea were nominally subject to the Crimean Khan. They were divided into the following groups: Budjak (from the Danube to the Dniester), Yedisan (from the Dniester to the Bug), Jamboyluk (Bug to Crimea), Yedickul (north of Crimea) and Kuban. =Internal affairs= Khan Qirim Girai, is known to have authorized the construction of many landmarks in Bakhchysarai and the Crimean Khanate. Internally, the khanate territory was divided among the beys, and beneath the beys were mirzas from noble families. The relationship of peasants or herdsmen to their mirzas was not feudal. They were free and the Islamic law protected them from losing their rights. Apportioned by village, the land was worked in common and taxes were assigned to the whole village. The tax was one tenth of an agricultural product, one twentieth of a herd animal, and a variable amount of unpaid labor. During the reforms by the last khan ≈ûahin Giray, the internal structure was changed following the Turkish pattern: the nobles' landholdings were proclaimed the domain of the khan and reorganized into qadƒ±lƒ±qs (provinces governed by representatives of the khan). =Crimean law= Me√±li I Giray at the court of Ottoman sultan Bayezid II Crimean law was based on Tatar law, Islamic law, and, in limited matters, Ottoman law. The leader of the Muslim establishment was the mufti, who was selected from among the local Muslim clergy. His major duty was neither judicial nor theological, but financial. The mufti's administration controlled all of the vakif lands and their enormous revenues. Another Muslim official, appointed not by the clergy but the Ottoman sultan, was the kadƒ±asker, the overseer of the khanate's judicial districts, each under jurisdiction of a kadi. In theory, kadis answered to the kadiaskers, but in practice they answered to the clan leaders and the khan. The kadis determined the day to day legal behavior of Muslims in the khanate. =Non-Muslim minorities= \\"Crimean Tatars travelling on the plains\\" by Carlo Bossoli. Substantial non-Muslim minorities - Greeks, Armenians, Crimean Goths, Adyghe (Circassians), Venetians, Genoese, Crimean Karaites and Qƒ±rƒ±m√ßaq Jews - lived principally in the cities, mostly in separate districts or suburbs. Under the millet system, they had their own religious and judicial institutions. They were subject to extra taxes in exchange for exemption from military service, living like Crimean Tatars and speaking dialects of Crimean Tatar. Mikhail Kizilov writes: \\"According to Marcin Broniewski (1578), the Tatars seldom cultivated the soil themselves, with most of their land tilled by the Polish, Ruthenian, Russian, and Walachian (Moldavian) slaves.\\" The Jewish population was concentrated in √áufut Kale ('Jewish Fortress'), a separate town near Bah√ßeseray that was the Khan's original capital. As other minorities, they spoke a Turkic language. Crimean law granted them special financial and political rights as a reward, according to local folklore, for historic services rendered to an uluhane (first wife of a Khan). The capitation tax on Jews in Crimea was levied by the office of the uluhane in Bah√ßeseray.Fisher p. 34 Much like the Christian population of Crimea, the Jews were actively involved in the slave trade. Both Christians and Jews also often redeemed Christian and Jewish captives of Tatar raids in Eastern Europe. Economy Agha Dedesh at the court of King John II Casimir, by Daniel Schultz. The nomadic part of the Crimean Tatars and all the Nogays were cattle breeders. Crimea had important trading ports where the goods arrived via the Silk Road were exported to the Ottoman Empire and Europe. Crimean Khanate had many large, beautiful, and lively cities such as the capital Bah√ßeseray, G√∂zleve (Yevpatoria), Karasu Bazaar (Karasu-market) and Aqmescit (White-mosque) having numerous hans (caravansarais and merchant quarters), tanners, and mills. Many monuments constructed under the Crimean Khanate were destroyed or left in ruins after the Russian invasion.A history of Ukraine, Paul Robert Magocsi, 347, 1996 Mosques, in particular were demolished or remade into Orthodox churches. The settled Crimean Tatars were engaged in trade, agriculture, and artisanry. Crimea was a center of wine, tobacco, and fruit cultivation. Bah√ßeseray kilims (oriental rugs) were exported to Poland, and knives made by Crimean Tatar artisans were deemed the best by the Caucasian tribes. Crimea was also renowned for manufacture of silk and honey. The slave trade (15th-17th century) in captured Ukrainians and Russians was one of the major sources of income of Crimean Tartar and Nogay nobility. In this process, known as harvesting the steppe, raiding parties would go out and capture, and then enslave the local Christian peasants living in the countryside.Williams In spite of the dangers, Polish and Russian serfs were attracted to the freedom offered by the empty steppes of Ukraine. The slave raids entered Russian and Cossack folklore and many dumy were written elegising the victims' fates. This contributed to a hatred for the Khanate that transcended political or military concerns. But in fact, there were always small raids committed by both Tatars and Cossacks, in both directions.The Russian Annexation of the Crimea 1772-1783, page 26 The last recorded major Crimean raid, before those in the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) took place during the reign of Peter I (1682‚Äì1725). thumb Crimean art and architecture =Selim II Giray fountain= The Selim II Giray fountain, built in 1747, is considered one of the masterpieces of Crimean Khanate's hydraulic engineering designs and is still marveled in modern times. It consists of small ceramic pipes, boxed in an underground stone tunnel, stretching back to the spring source more than away. It was one of the finest sources of water in Bakhchisaray. =Bakhchisaray Fountain= Crimean Khan's Palace in Bakhchysaray, by Carlo Bossoli One of the notable constructors of Crimean art and architecture was Qƒ±rƒ±m Giray, who in 1764 commissioned the fountain master Omer the Persian to construct the Bakhchisaray Fountain. The Bakhchisaray Fountain or Fountain of Tears is a real case of life imitating art. The fountain is known as the embodiment of love of one of the last Crimean Khans, Khan Qƒ±rƒ±m Giray for his young wife, and his grief after her early death. The Khan was said to have fallen in love with a Polish girl in his harem. Despite his battle-hardened harshness, he was grievous and wept when she died, astonishing all those who knew him.

The estates controlled by beys were called beylik. Beys in the khanate were as important as the Polish Magnats. Directly to the khan belonged Cufut-Qale, Bakhchisaray, and Staryi Krym (Eski Qirim). The khan also possessed all the salt lakes and the villages around them, as well as the woods around the rivers Alma, Kacha, and Salgir. Part of his own estate included the wastelands with their newly created settlements. Part of the main khan's estates were the lands of the Kalha-sultan (Qalƒüa) who was next in the line of succession of the khan's family. He usually administered the eastern portion of the peninsula. Kalha also was Chief Commander of the Crimean Army in the absence of the Khan. The next hereditary administrative position, called Nureddin, was also assigned to the khan's family. He administrated the western region of the peninsula. There also was a specifically assigned position for the khan's mother or sister ‚Äî Ana-beim ‚Äî which was similar to the Ottomans' Valide Sultan. The senior wife of the Khan carried a rank of Ulu-beim and was next in importance to the Nureddin. By the end of the khanate regional offices of the kaimakans, who administered smaller regions of the Crimean Khanate, were created. * Or Qapƒ± (Perekop) had special status.

Biography =Early life= √âdouard-Denis Baldus was born on June 5, 1813 in Gr√ºnebach, Prussia. He was originally trained as a painter and had also worked as a draughtsman and lithographer before switching to photography in 1849. =Career= In 1851, he was commissioned for the Missions H√©liographiques by the Historic Monuments Commission of France to photograph historic buildings, bridges and monuments, many of which were being razed to make way for the grand boulevards of Paris, being carried out under the direction of Napoleon III's prefect Baron Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. The high quality of his work won him government support for a project entitled Les Villes de France Photographi√©es, an extended series of architectural views in Paris and the provinces designed to feed a resurgent interest in the nation's Roman and medieval past. In 1855, Baron James de Rothschild, President of Chemin de Fer du Nord, commissioned Baldus to do a series of photographs to be used as part of an album that was to be a gift to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as a souvenir of their visit to France that year. The lavishly bound album is still among the treasures of the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. In 1856, he set out on a brief assignment to photograph the destruction caused by torrential rains and overflowing rivers in Lyon, Avignon, and Tarascon. He created a moving record of the flood without explicitly depicting the human suffering left in its wake. =Innovations in photography= Baldus was well known throughout France for his efforts in photography. One of his greatest assignments was to document the construction of the Louvre museum. He used wet and dry paper negatives as large as 10x14 inches in size. From these negatives, he made contact prints. To create a larger image, he put contact prints side by side to create a panoramic effect. He was renowned for the sheer size of his pictures, which ranged up to eight feet long for one panorama from around 1855, made from several negatives. Despite the documentary nature of many of his assignments, Baldus was inventive in overcoming the limitations of the calotype process (described here). He often retouched his negatives to blank out buildings and trees, or to put clouds in white skies; in his composite print of the medieval cloister of St. Trophime, in Arles (1851), he pieced together fragments of 10 different negatives to capture focus in depth in a panoramic view of the interior space and also render detail in the brightly lit courtyard outside. =Death= He died in 1889 in Arcueil, France.

[1] Miller, Arthur. Collected Plays, 1944‚Äì1961. New York: Library of America, 2006, p. 756 It opened on Broadway at the Coronet Theatre in New York City on January 29, 1947, closed on November 8, 1949, and ran for 328 performances. It was directed by Elia Kazan (to whom it is dedicated), produced by Elia Kazan and Harold Clurman, and won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. It starred Ed Begley, Beth Merrill, Arthur Kennedy, and Karl Malden and won both the Tony Award for Best Author and the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play. The play was adapted for films in 1948 and 1987. Background Miller wrote All My Sons after his first play The Man Who Had All the Luck failed on Broadway, lasting only four performances. Miller wrote All My Sons as a final attempt at writing a commercially successful play; he vowed to \\"find some other line of work\\" if the play did not find an audience. All My Sons is based upon a true story, which Arthur Miller's then-mother-in-law pointed out in an Ohio newspaper.Meyers, Jeffrey, The Genius and the Goddess: Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, University of Illinois Press, (2009), pp. 92‚Äì93 The news story described how in 1941‚Äì43 the Wright Aeronautical Corporation based in Ohio had conspired with army inspection officers to approve defective aircraft engines destined for military use.Clausen, Henry C., and Lee, Bruce, Pearl Harbor: Final Judgment, Da Capo Press, (2001), pp. 56‚Äì58 The story of defective engines had reached investigators working for Sen. Harry Truman's congressional investigative board after several Wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company; they would later testify under oath before Congress. In 1944, three Army Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Frank C. Greulich, Major Walter A. Ryan, and Major William Bruckmann were relieved of duty and later convicted of neglect of duty.Hinton, Harold B., Air Victory: the men and the machines, New York: Harper & Bros. (1948), pp. 249‚Äì251Corning, New York Leader (April 5, 1944), p. 9Three Air Officers 'Guilty of Neglect', Ordered Dismissed, The Milwaukee Journal, April 26, 1944, p. 33 Henrik Ibsen's influence on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play The Wild Duck, from where Miller took the idea of two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other. This is mirrored in All My Sons. He also borrowed the idea of a character's idealism being the source of a problem. The criticism of the American Dream, which lies at the heart of All My Sons, was one reason why Arthur Miller was called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist sentiment. Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare. Characters Joe Keller ‚Äî Joe, 60, was exonerated after being charged with knowingly shipping from his factory defective aircraft engine cylinder heads (for Curtiss P-40 fighters) during World War II, becoming (in his own words) \\"the guy who made 21 P-40s crash in Australia\\". For over three years he has placed the blame on his partner and former neighbor, Steve Deever, although he himself committed the crime. When the truth comes out, Joe justifies his actions by claiming that he did it for his family. Kate Keller (Mother) ‚Äî Kate, 50, knows that Joe is guilty but lives in denial while mourning for her older son Larry, who has been \\"missing in action\\" for three years. She refuses to believe that Larry is dead and maintains that Ann Deever ‚Äî who returns for a visit at the request of Larry's brother Chris ‚Äî is still \\"Larry's girl\\" and also believes that he is coming back. Chris Keller ‚Äî Chris, 32, returned home from World War II two years before the play begins, disturbed by the realization that the world was continuing as if nothing had happened. He has summoned Ann Deever to the Keller house in order to ask her hand in marriage, but they're faced with the obstacle of Kate's unreasonable conviction that Larry will someday return. Chris idolizes his father, not knowing initially what he has done. Ann Deever ‚Äî Ann, 26, arrives at the Keller home having shunned her \\"guilty\\" father since his imprisonment. Throughout the play, Ann is often referred to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as \\"Annie\\". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his disappearance and has since moved on because she knows the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage to Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has corresponded by mail for two years. Ann is the truth-bearer in the play. George Deever ‚Äî George, 31, is Ann's older brother: a successful New York lawyer, WWII veteran, and a childhood friend of Chris's. He initially believed in his father's guilt, but upon visiting Steve in jail, realizes his innocence and becomes enraged at the Kellers for deceiving him. He returns to save his sister from her marriage to Chris, creating the catalyzing final events. Dr. Jim Bayliss ‚Äî Jim, 40, is a successful doctor, but is frustrated with the stifling domesticity of his life. He wants to become a medical researcher, but continues in his job as it pays the bills. He is a close friend to the Keller family and spends a lot of time in their backyard. Sue Bayliss ‚Äî Sue, 40, is Jim's wife: needling and dangerous, but affectionate. She too is a friend of the Keller family, but is secretly resentful of what she sees as Chris's bad idealistic influence on Jim. Sue confronts Ann about her resentment of Chris in a particularly volatile scene. Frank Lubey ‚Äî Frank, 33, was always one year ahead of the draft, so he never served in World War II, instead staying home to marry George's former sweetheart, Lydia. He draws up Larry's horoscope and tells Kate that Larry must still be alive, because the day he died was meant to be his \\"favorable day\\". This strengthens Kate's faith and makes it much harder for Ann to move on. Lydia Lubey ‚Äî Lydia, 27, was George's love interest before the war; after he went away, she married Frank and they soon had three children. She is a model of peaceful domesticity and lends a much-needed cheerful air to several moments of the play. Bert ‚Äî Bert, 8, is a little boy who lives in the neighborhood; he is friends with the Bayliss' son Tommy and frequently visits the Kellers' yard to play \\"jail\\" with Joe. He appears only twice in the play: the first time, his part seems relatively unimportant, but the second time his character is more important as he sparks a verbal attack from mother when mentioning \\"jail,\\" which highlights Joe's secret. =Unseen characters= Larry Keller ‚ÄîLarry has been MIA for some years at the start of the play. However, he has a significant effect on the play through his mother's insistence that he is still alive and his brother's love for Larry's childhood sweetheart, Ann. Comparisons are also made in the story between Larry and Chris; in particular, their father describes Larry as the more sensible one with a \\"head for business\\". Steve Deever ‚Äî George and Ann's father. Steve is sent to prison for shipping faulty aircraft parts‚Äîa crime that not only he but also the exonerated Keller committed. Synopsis =Act I= The play starts in the middle of the action, abruptly. In August 1946, Joe Keller, a self-made businessman, and his wife Kate are visited by a neighbor, Frank. At Kate's request, Frank is trying to figure out the horoscope of the Kellers' missing son Larry, who disappeared three years earlier while serving in the military during World War II. There has been a storm and the tree planted in Larry's honor has blown down during the month of his death, making it seem that Larry is still alive. While Kate still believes Larry is coming back, the Kellers' other son, Chris, believes differently. Furthermore, Chris wishes to propose to Ann Deever, who was Larry's girlfriend at the time he went missing and who has been corresponding with Chris for two years. Joe and Kate react to this news with shock but are interrupted by Bert, the boy next door. He tattles to Joe and wants to see the \\"jail\\". In a game, Bert brings up the word \\"jail\\", making Kate react sharply. When Ann arrives, it is revealed that her father, Steve Deever, is in prison for selling cracked cylinder heads to the Air Force, causing the deaths of twenty-one pilots. Joe was his partner but was exonerated of the crime. Ann admits that neither she nor her brother keeps in touch with their father anymore and wonders aloud whether a faulty engine was responsible for Larry's death. After a heated argument, Chris breaks in and later proposes to Ann, who accepts. Chris also reveals that while leading a company he lost all his men and is experiencing survivor's guilt. Meanwhile, Joe receives a phone call from George, Ann's brother, who is coming there to settle something. =Act II= Although Chris and Ann have become engaged, Chris avoids telling his mother. Their next door neighbor Sue emerges, revealing that everyone on the block thinks Joe is equally guilty of the crime of supplying faulty aircraft engines. Shortly afterwards, George Deever arrives and reveals that he has just visited the prison to see his father Steve. The latter has confirmed that Joe told him by phone to \\"weld up and paint over\\" the cracked cylinders and to send them out, and later gave a false promise to Steve that he would account for the shipment on the day of arrest. George insists his sister Ann cannot marry Chris Keller, son of the man who destroyed the Deevers. Meanwhile, Frank reveals his horoscope, implying that Larry is alive, which is just what Kate wants to hear. Joe maintains that on the fateful day of dispatch, the flu laid him up, but Kate says that Joe has not been sick in fifteen years. Despite George's protests, Ann sends him away. When Kate claims to Chris (who is still intent on marrying Ann) that moving on from Larry will be forsaking Joe as a murderer, Chris concludes that George was right. Joe, out of excuses, explains that he sent out the cracked airheads to avoid closure of the business, intending to notify the base later that they needed repairs. However, when the fleet crashed and made headlines, he lied to Steve and abandoned him at the factory to be arrested. Chris cannot accept this explanation, and exclaims in despair that he is torn about what to do about his father now. =Act III= Chris has left home. Reluctantly accepting the accusations against her husband, Kate says that, should Chris return, Joe must express willingness to go to prison in the hope that Chris will relent. As he only sought to make money at the insistence of his family, Joe is adamant that their relationship is above the law. Soon after, Ann emerges and expresses her intention to leave with Chris regardless of Kate's disdain. When Kate angrily refuses again, Ann reveals to Kate a letter from Larry. She had not wanted to share it, but knows that Kate must face reality. Chris returns, and is torn about whether to turn Joe in to the authorities, knowing it doesn't erase the death of his fellow soldiers or absolve the world of its natural merciless state. When Joe returns and excuses his guilt on account of his life's accomplishments, his son wearily responds, \\"I know you're no worse than other men, but I thought you were better. I never saw you as a man ... I saw you as my father.\\" Finally, the letter, read by Chris, reveals that because of his father's guilt, Larry planned to commit suicide. With this final blow, Joe finally agrees to turn himself in, saying of Larry, \\"Sure, he was my son. But I think to him they were all my sons. And I guess they were, I guess they were\\". Joe goes inside to get his coat, and kills himself with a gunshot off stage. At the end, when Chris expresses remorse in spite of his resolve, Kate tells him not to blame himself and to move on with his life. =Timeline= The precise date of events in the play are unclear. However it is possible to construct a timeline of All My Sons using the dialogue. The action takes place in August 1946, in Midwestern United States with the main story taking place on a Sunday morning. * Autumn 1943: Joe encourages Steve to supply the USAAF with faulty cylinder heads for aircraft engines * Autumn 1943: After 21 pilots crash, Joe and Steve are arrested * November 25, 1943: Having read about his father's arrest, Larry deliberately crashes his plane off the coast of China * 1944: Joe is released * August 1946, a Sunday morning at 4am: Larry's memorial blows down * August 1946, the same Sunday morning: Ann arrives at the Keller home * August 1946, the same Sunday morning: George visits Steve in prison (opening) Arthur Miller quotation on All My Sons In his Collected Plays, Miller commented on his feelings on watching an audience's reaction to a performance of his first successful play: > The success of a play, especially one's first success, is somewhat like > pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may > fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was > always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was > invigorating. It made it possible to dream of daring more and risking more. > The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped > when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, > for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invention a mass of > strangers has been publicly transfixed.

Miller's daughter, Rebecca Miller, asked McBurney to direct the play. Some controversy surrounded the production, as the internet group Anonymous staged an anti-Scientology protest at the first night of preview performances in New York City (due to cast member Katie Holmes). The cast dedicated their performance on September 27 to the actor Paul Newman, who died the day before. ;2010 London (West End) David Suchet and Zo√´ Wanamaker (both stars of the British TV series Agatha Christie's Poirot) starred in a revival production at the Apollo Theatre in London's West End.

This production starred Albert Dekker as Joe Keller, Megs Jenkins as Kate Keller, Patrick McGoohan as Chris Keller and Betta St. John as Ann Deever. 1987 All My Sons In 1987, All My Sons was made into a made-for-TV film. This version is more faithful to Arthur Miller's original play than the 1948 film version. The main roles are James Whitmore as Joe Keller, Aidan Quinn as Chris Keller, Michael Learned as Kate Keller and Joan Allen as Ann Deever. Direction was by Jack O'Brien. Unlike the 1948 version, this version refers to George's father as Steve as in the play rather than Herb or Herbert. In 1998, L.A. Theatre Works put on an unabridged radio production for broadcast on Voice of America and NPR. The play starred Julie Harris as Kate Keller, James Farentino as Joe Keller and Arye Gross as Chris Keller.  In popular culture  All My Sons was the inspiration for the name of the popular band Twenty One Pilots.

Founded in October 1905, its aim was to rally the people behind 'Great Russian nationalism' and the Tsar, espousing anti-socialist, anti-liberal, and above all antisemitic views. By 1906 it had over 300,000 members. Its paramilitary armed bands, called the Black Hundreds, fought revolutionaries violently in the streets. Its leaders organised a series of political assassinations of deputies and other representatives of parties which supported the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Union was dissolved in 1917 in the wake of the Revolution, and its leader, Alexander Dubrovin placed under arrest. Some modern academic researchers view the Union of the Russian People as an early example of fascism.Rogger Ideology and political views The Union was the leading exponent of antisemitism in the wake of the 1905 Revolution.Figes, p. 245 It has been described as 'an early Russian version of the Fascist movement', as it was anti-socialist, anti-liberal, and 'above all anti-Semitic'. The Union of the Russian People called for the 'restoration of the popular autocracy', a concept they believed had existed before Russia had been taken over by 'intellectuals and Jews'. Antisemitism was brought into the URP by what became the organisation's ideological core, chairman Alexander Dubrovin, Vladimir Purishkevich, Pavel Krushevan, Pavel Bulatsel and some other 'radical temperament anti-Semitic rabble- rousers', who had seceded from the Russian Assembly.Rogger, p. 191‚Äì3 The methods of the Union were not what the Russian Assembly considered proper conduct.Rogger, p. 193 Save lawyer and journalist Bulatsel, another leading intellectual of the URP was B. V. Nikolsky, privatdozent (senior lecturer) at Petersburg University.Rogger, p. 204 The Union was above all a movement of 'Great Russian nationalism'.Figes, p. 246 Its very first aim it had declared to be a 'Great Russia, United and Indivisible'. Its nationalism was based on xenophobia and racism. The Union also actively campaigned against Ukrainian self-determination and in particular, against the 'cult' of the popular Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko.–ü–ê–ù–ò–•–ò–î–´ –ü–û –¢. –®–ï–í–ß–ï–ù–ö–ï –ò –ß–ï–†–ù–û–°–û–¢–ï–ù–ù–û–ï –î–£–•–û–í–ï–°–¢–í–û. –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å. ‚Äî –ú., 1912. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 5 ‚Äî –°. 82. History =Creation= The Union of the Russian people was by far the most important of the extreme rightist groups formed in the wake of the 1905 Revolution.Figes, p. 196 It was founded in October 1905 as a movement to mobilise and rally the masses against the Left, by the two 'minor government officials' Alexander Dubrovin and Vladimir Purishkevich. The idea to create the union originated between several public figures of Russia who entered its political arena before the 1905 Russian Revolution. =1905‚Äì06= Five days after the proclamation of the October Manifesto on , Purishkevich, Apollo Apollonovich Maikov (son of poet Apollon Maykov), Pavel Bulatzel, Baranov, Vladimir Gringmut and some others gathered at Dubrovin's home. At this meeting, they concurred with Dubrovin's idea to set up a political organization (Dubrovin opposed to calling it a party). In a couple of weeks initiators worked out an organisational structure, devised a program, and on formally announced the founding of the Union of the Russian People. Dubrovin was elected its chairman.Rawson, p. 59 The Union's Manifesto expressed a 'plebeian mistrust' of every political party, as well as the bureaucracy and the intelligentsia. The group looked at these as obstacles to 'the direct communion between the Tsar and his people'. This struck a deep chord with Nicholas II, who also shared the deep belief in re-establishment of autocratic personal rule, as had existed in the Muscovite state of the 1600s. It also stood for the russification of non-Russian citizens. The charter was adopted in August 1906. =Support= After the 1905 Revolution the Orthodox Church's conservative clergy members allied with extreme Rightist organisations, the Union of the Russian People being one of them, in opposing the liberals' further attempts at a church reform and extension of religious freedom and toleration.Figes, p. 69 Several prominent, leading church members were also supportive of the organisation, among them the royal family's close friend and future Orthodox Saint John of Kronstadt, Iliodor the monk, and Bishop Hermogenes. It also had support from leading members of the court and government, one of the supporters being the Minister of the Interior Nikolay Maklakov. Tsar Nicholas II was highly supportive of the Union and patronised it:Figes, p. 82 & 196 he wore the badge of the Union, and wished the Union and its leaders 'total success' in their efforts to unite what he called 'loyal Russians' in defence of the autocracy. The Tsar also gave orders to provide funds for the Union, and the Ministry of the Interior complied by funding the Union's newspapers, and also providing them with weapons through secret channels. Dubrovin was also in contact with senior officials and the secret services of Russia. Minister of the Interior Pyotr Durnovo was completely in the know about the foundation of the UnionRogger, p. 266, note number 43 while his subordinates actively worked upon creation of an open organisation to counteract the influence of revolutionaries and liberals among the masses. Around the same the head of the political section of gendarmes department Pyotr Rachkovsky reported his chief, Colonel (later General) about such attempts and proposed Gerasimov to introduce him to Dubrovin. Their meeting took place in late October 1905 in the apartment of Rachkovsky.Rogger, p. 203‚Äì204 With powerful administrative support and funding at their disposal, the Union of the Russian People managed to organise and conduct its first mass public event less than a fortnight after its creation. The first public rally of the URP, with about 2,000 attendance, was held on in Mikhailovsky Manege, a popular venue in Petersburg. An orchestra was playing, a church choir sang \\"Praise God\\" and \\"Tsar Divine\\"; leaders of the URP (Dubrovin, Purishkevich, Bulatsel, Nikolsky) addressed the mob from a rostrum erected in the centre of the arena. Special guests from the \\"Russian Assembly\\": Prince M. N. Volkonsky, journalist from Novoye Vremya Nicholas Engelhardt and two bishops also welcomed the new party with their speeches. Members of the Tsar's court, like Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich, Alexander Trepov, and other government officials and clergy members 'unquestionably welcomed a movement such as this'. Sergei Witte was a rare occasion among high-ranking officials being 'unequivocally hostile to the URP'Rogger, p. 205 (in his memoirs he calls Dubrovin a 'high-handed and abusive leader').The Memoirs of Count Witte, p. 829 =Street fighting= The Union was horrified by Tsar Nicholas II's refusal to strike down harshly on the Leftist revolutionaries. The Union, therefore, decided to organise this for the Tsar, and organised paramilitary bands, which came to be known as the 'Black Hundreds' by the democrats, to fight revolutionaries in the streets. These militant groups marched through the streets holding in their pockets knives and brass knuckles, and carrying religious symbols such as icons and crosses and imperial ones such as patriotic banners and portraits of Tsar Nicholas II. They marched through the streets fighting to 'revenge themselves' and restore the old hierarchy of society and races. Their numbers were swelled by thousands of criminals who had been released as a part of the October amnesty, who looked at it as a chance of violence and pillaging. Often encouraged by police officers, they beat up suspected democratic sympathisers, making them kneel before tsarist portraits or making them kiss the Imperial flag.Figes, p. 197 In October 1906, they formed a Black-Hundredist organisation called Russian People United (). =1906‚Äì1917= Joint electoral campaign poster of the Union of the Russian People and the Union of October 17 (Octobrists Party) By 1906 the Union had a total of 300,000 members spread over 1,000 different branches. Most of their supporters came from the social stratum which 'had either lost ‚Äì or were afraid of losing ‚Äì their petty status' in society as a result of reform and modernisation ‚Äì much like the supporters of fascism ‚Äì among them urbanised peasants working as labourers, policemen and other low-ranking state officials who risked losing their power, and small shopkeepers and artisans who were losing the competition against big business and industry. By 1907 it is said about up to 900 local URP branches existed in many cities, towns and even villages. Apart from the ones named above, the largest were in Kiev, Saratov and Astrakhan; Volhynian Governorate is also mentioned among the largest by the representation of the URP. The Union opposed Stolypin's reforms, being supporters of the 'legitimist bloc' which, through its support in the court, church, nobility and the Union, defeated nearly all of Stolypin's reform proposals.Figes, p. 227 The Union also became the main instigator (through meetings, gatherings, lectures, manifestations and mass public prayers) of the pogroms against Jews (especially in 1906 in Gomel, Yalta, Bia≈Çystok, Odessa, Sedlets and other cities), in which members of the URP often took an active part.\\"... –î–≤–µ —Å–∏–ª—ã —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø–æ–≥—Ä–æ–º—ã: –≤–æ-–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã—Ö, —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å–æ—Ç–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –∫ —Ç–æ–º—É –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –æ–∫—Ä–µ–ø—à–∏–µ, –∏, –≤–æ-–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö, –∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∏–∑–º. –ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Å–∞–º –ø–æ —Å–µ–±–µ –º–Ω–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—à–Ω—ã–º, –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≥—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–æ. –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∏–∑–º, –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥—è –∏–∑ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞ –≤ –≤–∏–¥–µ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è, –ø–æ –∏–µ—Ä–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ª–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–µ –¥–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª –¥–æ –Ω–∏–∑–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞ –≤—ã–ª–∏—Ç—ã–º –≤ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏–∑—ã–≤ –∫ –∏–∑–±–∏–µ–Ω–∏—è–º –µ–≤—Ä–µ–µ–≤; —ã–≤ –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞–ª—Å—è –∏ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è–ª—Å—è —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å–æ—Ç–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∫—Ä—É–∂–∫–∞–º–∏.\\" (A.

In 1908 URP members of the clergy claimed through a petition the right to carry weapons; this petition, however, was denied.http://starosti.ru/archive.php?m=12&y;=1908 In 1908‚Äì10, the infighting in the URP broke the organisation into several smaller entities, which were in constant conflict with each other: Union of Archangel Michael (), Union of the Russian People (), Dubrovin‚Äôs All-Russian Union of the Russian People in Petersburg (), etc. After the February Revolution of 1917, all of the Black-Hundredist organisations were forcefully dissolved and banned. Soon after the February Revolution of 1917, the URP was suspended and its leader Alexander Dubrovin was arrested. Party leaders and organisation The supreme body of URP was called the Main Council (). Its chairman Alexander Dubrovin had two deputies: noble landowner and future Duma Deputy Vladimir Purishkevich and engineer A. I. Trishatny. From six other board members (Pavel Bulatzel, George Butmi, P. P. Surin and others) four belonged to the merchant estate, and two were peasants by origin. A merchant from Petersburg I. I. Baranov was the treasurer of the URP, and barrister Sergei Trishatny (elder brother of a Deputy Chairman) performed as secretary. Later the Main Council increased to 12 members, among which S. D. Chekalov, M. N. Zelensky, Ye. D. Golubev, N. N. Yazykov, G. A. Slipak are mentioned. =Newspapers= URP‚Äôs chief newspaper was Russkoe znamya (Russian Banner), a newspaper which first published notorious \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\". In provincial Russia The Pochayev Circular () was the most popular of the URP newspapers. URP also printed its propaganda materials in Moskovskiye Vedomosti (\\"Moscow News\\"), Grazhdanin (\\"Citizen\\"), Kievlyanin (\\"Kievan\\") and others.

Debuting in 1993's Mortal Kombat II as an unplayable secret character who was a green palette swap of Kitana and Mileena, Jade made her first playable appearance in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. She has since become a regular supporting character in the franchise, appearing on series merchandise in addition to alternate Mortal Kombat media, such as comic books and the feature film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In the games, Jade's initial background is that of an assassin in the service of evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn, which was expanded upon in UMK3 and onward to her being a friend and confidante of Princess Kitana, as well as a fellow patriot of their otherworldly home realm of Edenia that was enslaved by the Kahn. In the series reboot, Jade is a central character in the game's story mode and additionally joins forces with the Earthrealm warriors in their attempt to defeat Shao Kahn. She is often regarded as one of the best series characters in regards to gameplay, and has received mostly positive general and critical reception. Appearances =In video games= In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Jade was a hidden character who played no part in the game's storyline other than appearing at the start of random fights to drop cryptic clues on how to access her. Players have to then meet particular requirements during gameplay in order to fight Jade in a secret battle in the \\"Goro's Lair\\" stage from the first game. She is wearing a green outfit similar to that of warrior princess Kitana and her ‚ÄúSister ‚Äú, and fights with increased speed and the former's fans. Though she identifies herself in one of the clues, her energy bar was left blank in the arcade game which was included in the home versions. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the 2005 beat 'em up action-adventure spinoff that retold the events of MKII, she engages Shaolin warriors Liu Kang and Kung Lao in a fight alongside Mileena and a brainwashed Kitana, and loses against them.

She served as one of Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's elite assassins along with his adopted stepdaughter Kitana, with whom she shared a close friendship. After Kitana flees to Earthrealm after being put on trial for killing Mileena, Shao Kahn orders Jade to bring Kitana back to him alive; forcing her to choose between disobeying her superior or betraying her close friend.Jade Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Biography - Mortal Kombat Warehouse.

When Jade and Reptile locate Kitana, the former stops the latter from assassinating her. Convinced by Reptile's actions and Kitana's words, Jade turns against the Kahn and aids Princess Kitana in freeing her resurrected mother, Queen Sindel, from Shao Kahn's mind control. The three join up with Kitana's Earthrealm allies to defeat Shao Kahn, and after they liberate Edenia from Outworld, Jade serves Sindel and Kitana for years. Jade's UMK3 backstory, along with those of Kitana and Reptile, remains unchanged in Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996). Jade returned as a playable character in Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004) following an extended absence from the series. She witnesses the deaths of Kitana and the thunder god Raiden's chosen fighters at the hands of the Deadly Alliance of sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi and their subsequent resurrection by the Dragon King Onaga. Jade is forced to imprison a brainwashed princess Kitana in the Edenian palace dungeon before freeing Sindel and escaping with her to Outworld, all while seeking revenge against traitorous fellow Edenian,Tanya , who had allied herself with Onaga. In Sindel's non-canonical ending, she and Jade locate Onaga's tomb when he sends Kitana after them. Jade battles her friend before Sindel kills Onaga, breaking Kitana from his spell and returning peace to Edenia.

Jade debuted in Mortal Kombat II as a green palette swap of Kitana with darker skin and gold-tinted duplicates of her steel fans. Ed Boon said she was initially just \\"an evil version of Kitana, in a sense.\\" While the game was in development, the team wanted to add a secret character based on Katalin Zamiar, who had already been filmed performing as Kitana and Mileena; Jade was created in what Zamiar described as a mostly \\"on the spot\\" fashion. Zamiar's outfit used for filming the female ninja characters was blue,VideoGames: The Ultimate Gaming Magazine #63 (April 1994), p. 49. and presented some challenges for the actress during filming, such as the bottoms of the leggings being a bit too slippery for moves such as jump kicksGamePro 58 (May 1994), pages 28-31. and the tops having to be held up with rubber bands, while her mask was taped to her nose to keep it in place. Zamiar did not return for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 due to brewing legal issues with Midway, and was replaced by Becky Gable. At that point, Jade was given a staff weapon to further separate her from Kitana and Mileena. In UMK3 and subsequent titles where the three of them appear, while Mileena's skin color is sometimes mildly darker than Kitana's, Jade's skin is consistently the darkest of the three. In the 2011 reboot game, Jade can have classic palette-swapped outfits from the 1990s as some of her alternate costumes; there is even a secret special encounter battle against her wielding Kitana's fans just like in Mortal Kombat II. Like their male ninja counterparts in the Mortal Kombat games, Kitana, Mileena and Jade evolved considerably from their original palette swaps in the three-dimensional titles, receiving distinct new designs and other features. John Vogel, who worked on story and animations for Deception, said \\"the approach we've taken for Jade in this game is that she's more of stealthy ninja type of character.

Tor Books (1995), . alt= Jade was a supporting character in the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and was portrayed by Siberian-born supermodel and actress Irina Pantaeva in the role of \\"a beautiful refugee from Outworld.\\"Black Belt January 1998, page 84. She first appears before Liu Kang wearing a fur cloak over a revealing cloth outfit, after he awakens from a dream state induced by Nightwolf, who had been training him earlier. In her only fight scene, she attacks Liu Kang when he rejects her advances (the film's special features explain she actually did develop \\"a burning desire to have Liu love her\\"), before which she magically changes to her familiar green costume. Her staff is instead a spear that she hurls at him and misses, and he subdues her after a quick hand-to-hand battle. Jade has no past relationship nor any interaction with Kitana in the film, and she secretly remains loyal to Shao Kahn while pretending to aid the Earthrealm warriors in her attempt to lead them into an ambush. When this fails, Shao Kahn has her eaten alive by a gargoyle in his palace. Pantaeva, making her English-language film debut while having no martial arts experience, underwent six months' training prior to shooting \\"so that my character would grow into a powerful and sexy warrior.\\" The fight scene was shot in Thailand in a single take, and Pantaeva had enjoyed the experience to the extent that she successfully asked Annihilation director John R. Leonetti to do a second take. The \\"absolutely, stunningly beautiful\\" Jade's role in Jerome Preisler's novelization of Annihilation, based in part on the screenplays by Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel, differs little from her onscreen role as she attempts to seduce Liu Kang (there is no fight between them in this version) and later lures the Earthrealm warriors into a trap, but was additionally revealed to be Kitana's former lover, during which she makes mention of her Edenian heritage. She is still put to death by the enraged Shao Kahn for her failure in ambushing the Earth warriors; Kahn first strangles her and then feeds her to a living stained glass window monster.Preisler, Jerome. Mortal Kombat Annihilation. Tor Books (1997), . She is a recurring guest character in the Mortal Kombat series published by Malibu Comics, first in the 1995 miniseries Battlewave, in which she is simply an evil assassin serving Shao Kahn and had no connection to Kitana, instead being paired regularly with fellow Mortal Kombat II hidden character Smoke. She is identical to Kitana only in that she is brunette with light skin and employed a pair of steel fans, while her green palette was unchanged; her eyes are variably drawn with and without lens. Jade and Smoke unsuccessfully attempt to assassinate Jax in a hospital and Johnny Cage aboard a plane headed to Outworld, and also Liu Kang in Outworld. In the finale of the 1995 three-issue miniseries Rayden and Kano, she and Smoke try to redeem themselves by killing Raiden, but again fail. Jade was slated to make a single-episode appearance in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. Threshold Entertainment, the series' producers, had published a guide for its writers prior to production that contained brief biographies of series characters shortlisted for inclusion in the show. Jade's role in the guide was that of \\"a childhood friend of Kitana's but also works for [Shao] Kahn at times. She is alluring, mysterious and exotic, yet she cannot be trusted. She use[s] her beauty to lure her unsuspecting prey.\\"Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm Writer's Guide, Threshold Entertainment, c. 1995-96. However, Jade was ultimately converted by Threshold into an original character renamed Ruby. =Promotion and merchandise= A computer-generated Jade \\"hosted\\" G4's 2005 digital beauty pageant Girls Gone Wired,G4 press release (hosted on the official website of Tomb Raider Chronicles) in which she declared her superiority over Pamela Anderson.

Two different Jade action figures (basic and 10-inch models, each with different featured weapons) were released by Toy Island in 1996 as part of their Mortal Kombat Trilogy line. A Jade figurine was included with a 1995 special issue of Argentinian magazine Top Kids that featured a cover story titled \\"Jade: mystery warrior.\\" She was included with the MKII cast in the 1994 Mortal Kombat Kard Game produced by BradyGames as a common character, and in the 2004 Epic Battles card game, which featured the Mortal Kombat: Deception roster, as one of the \\"rare\\" characters.Epic Battles Card List - ViciousMK.com.

Reception The character has received a mostly positive critical reception. Game Players listed her among \\"MKII's best characters\\" as compared to \\"the less interesting MK3 characters.\\"Game Players 59 (December 1995) page 52. On the other hand, Screen Rant's Joseph Walter felt the way Jade was featured in Mortal Kombat II hurt that game as a whole. UGO ranked Jade 21st in their 2012 listing of the top fifty Mortal Kombat characters. She topped the Mortal Kombat category of the \\"Miss of Video Games 2012\\" award by Polish console magazine PSX Extreme, while placing thirteenth overall. However, she was ranked 59th in Den of Geek's 2015 rating of the franchise's 73 player characters for what they perceived as her lack of depth. \\"Jade gets to show up in modern games because she was in Mortal Kombat II, but she doesn't really bring anything to the table.\\" According to UGO's Chris Plante, \\"Jade [seems] to fetishize Eastern culture. Her skin tone is darker than similarly-dressed characters Kitana and Mileena, who are her aristocratic superiors. She is paradox: equal parts exotic slave girl and Asian princess, her most powerful weapon being her sexuality. She's the mystical, foreign widow, a relic of postwar pulp novels.\\" While comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, GamePro chose Jade to represent Lust.Chris Holt, Scalia clearly doesn‚Äôt play Mortal Kombat, read Dante, GamePro, June 27, 2011. Jade placed third out of five in the \\"Sexiest Finish\\" category of G4TV's 2005 Video Game Vixens pageant, and was included among the \\"hottest chicks of 2011\\" by Univision. Complex ranked her as number one in their 2011 list of the \\"best looking sideline chicks in games,\\" declaring a preference for her over Kitana, Mileena and Sonya. \\"No one should be so lethal with a stripper pole (okay, we meant staff), but she's capable of doing amazing things with it.\\" Jade was ranked as the 30th-best looking game girl by GameHall's Portal PlayGame in 2014, while her breasts were ranked as the third-finest in video games by GameFront's Ross Lincoln in 2011, and seventh-best by Drea Avellan of Complex in 2012. Jade, Mileena and Kitana were all included among the top ten \\"hottest female villains in gaming\\" by Travis Huber of Cheat Code Central in 2014: \\"I am calling these characters the trifecta of terror. Or maybe the trifecta of T&A.;\\" alt= GameFront's Phil Owen noted her popularity among the more attractive cosplayers, as did the staffs of Heavy.com and TF1. Fitness model Alicia Marie dressed up as Jade for the 2013 Comic-Con alongside Adrianne Curry as Mileena. Dressed as Jade, Paris Sinclair participated in a photo session with Jessica Nigri dressed as Sonya. Conversely, however, some criticized what was perceived as oversexualization of the character, with io9 including a Jade costume among 2011's \\"sluttiest and weirdest\\" store-bought Halloween dress-ups. Jade and Kitana represented the \\"women who fight\\" trope in Chad Hunter's 2012 Complex list of the fifteen most stereotypical characters in video games, as embodying \\"half-naked skanks who can fight, hurl lasers and perform aerobatic attacks while wearing thongs, high-heeled boots and keeping their giant breasts under scarves.\\"Chad Hunter, The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters In Video Games, Complex.com, May 9, 2010. Jade's \\"Head Gymnastics\\" Fatality from Mortal Kombat: Deception has been received positively, for instance placing 33rd in Prima Games' 2014 ranking of the series' top fifty Fatalities. Previously, Game Informer included it in their 2010 selection of the series' best finishers. Adam Dodd of Cheat Code Central ranked it sixth in his list of the series' top ten finishers, stating: \\"This fatality is brutal, stylish, and includes a little showmanship, and that's essentially everything a fatality needs to be.\\" Jade's appearance in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, like many of the film's cast of characters, was not well received. James Deaux of Earth-2 opined, \\"[She] served only one purpose in this movie: to be the seductive harpy who pretends to assist Liu Kang but is really there to stall, confuse, grope and otherwise wound him.\\" Eva Vandergeld from Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension described Jade in her pre- fight outfit as \\"an Asian Pocahontas-wannabe in a Victoria's Secret catalogue.\\" Doug Skiles of Killer Movies wrote in his 1997 review of the film, \\"Who honestly cares about the woman that shows up calling herself Jade?\\" In 2010, Jade was included by Game Informer among the series' unwanted \\"palette swap characters,\\" excluding Scorpion and Sub-Zero, for omission from future Mortal Kombat installments. However, according to Ed Boon himself, \\"even with Kitana's mournful variation, Jade is the most missed female fighter in Mortal Kombat X\\" by fans, as evidenced by the results of a poll he had posted on Twitter. Previously, Mortal Kombat X producer Shaun Himmerick had quit his social media presence following a string of violent threats issued towards him and his family after announcing Jade's removal from the game on a stream.

It is the largest city in and eponymous capital of Erzurum Province. It is situated 1757 meters (5766 feet) above sea level. Erzurum had a population of 361,235 in the 2000 census, increasing to 367,250 by 2010. The city has a large Kurdish population. The city uses the double-headed Anatolian Seljuk Eagle as its coat-of-arms, a motif that was a common symbol throughout Anatolia and the Balkans in the medieval period. Erzurum has some diverse winter sports facilities in Turkey and hosted the 2011 Winter Universiade.  Name and etymology  A view of Emir Saltuk Tomb in Erzurum Tombs in Erzurum The city was originally known in Armenian as Karno K'aghak' (), meaning city of Karin, to distinguish it from the district of Karin (‘ø’°÷Ä’´’∂). After the Arab conquest of Armenia, the city was known to the Arabs as KƒÅlƒ´kalƒÅ (which was adopted from the original Armenian name). During Roman times, Erzurum was named Theodosiopolis (, ), or ‚Äì in Armenia or ‚Äì in Cappadocia to distinguish is from several namesakes. It got its present name after its conquest by the Seljuks following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. A neighboring commercial city named Artze (Arcn, Arzan; Armenian: ‘±÷Ä’Æ’∂) was heavily sacked by the Seljuk Turks in 1048/49.. Its Armenian, Syrian, and other Christian inhabitants moved to Theodosiopolis, which they began calling \\"Artsn Rum\\" (meaning Artze of the R√ªm, i.e., Romans) to distinguish it from their former residence.See Joseph Laurent's extensive note in his L‚ÄôArm√©nie entre Byzance et l‚ÄôIslam depuis la conqu√™te arabe jusqu‚Äôen 886, 1919, new edition revised and updated by Marius Canard, Lisbon: Librairie Bertrand, 1980, pp. 87‚Äì88, note 83.

Armenia: a Historical Atlas. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 103. After the partition of Armenia between the Eastern Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia in 387 AD, the city passed into the hands of the Romans.

As the chief military stronghold along the eastern border of the empire, Theodosiopolis held a highly important strategic location and was fiercely contested in wars between the Byzantines and Persians. Emperors Anastasius I and Justinian I both refortified the city and built new defenses during their reigns.

It became the capital of the emirate of ·∏≤ƒÅlƒ´·∏≥alƒÅ and was used as a base for raids into Byzantine territory. Though only an island of Arab power within Christian Armenian-populated territory, the native population was generally a reliable client of the Caliph's governors. As the power of the Caliphate declined, and the resurgence of Byzantium began, the local Armenian leaders preferred the city to be under the control of powerless Muslim emirs rather than powerful Byzantine emperors.Whittow, Mark. The Making of Byzantium, 600‚Äì1025. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, pp. 310, 320. In 931, and again in 949, Byzantine forces led by Theophilos Kourkouas, grandfather of the future emperor John I Tzimiskes, captured Theodosiopolis. Its Arab population was expelled and the city was resettled by Greeks and Armenians.Whittow. The Making of Byzantium, p. 322. Emperor Basil II rebuilt the city and its defenses in 1018 with the help of the local Armenian population.Arakelyan. \\"The Great Cities of Armenia\\", pp. 232‚Äì233. In 1071, after the decisive battle at Manzikert, the Seljuk Turks took possession of Theodosiopolis. The Saltukids were rulers of an Anatolian beylik (principality) centered in Erzurum, who ruled from 1071 to 1202. Melike Mama Hatun, sister of N√¢sƒ±r√ºddin Muhammed, was the ruler between 1191 and 1200. Theodosiopolis repelled many attacks and military campaigns by the Seljuks and Georgians (the latter knew the city as Karnu-Kalaki) until 1201 when the city and the province was conquered by the Seljuk sultan S√ºleymanshah II. Erzen- Erzurum fell to the Mongol siege in 1242, and the city was looted and devastated. After the fall of the Sultanate of Rum in early 14th century, it became an administrative province of the Ilkhanate, and later on the city was under Empire of Trebizond occupation for a while around the 1310s.Zehiroƒülu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorluƒüu 2\\" 2016, Trabzon, () ; pp.133‚Äì134 Then became part of the √áoban beylik, Black Sheep Turkmen, empire of Timur Lenk and White Sheep Turkmen. It subsequently passed to Safavid Persia, until the Ottomans under Selim I in 1514 conquered it through the Battle of Chaldiran. During the Ottoman Empire reign, the city served as the main base of Ottoman military power in the region. It served as the capital of the eyalet of Erzurum. Early in the seventeenth century, the province was threatened by Safavid Persia and a revolt by the province governor Abaza Mehmed Pasha. This revolt was combined with Jelali Revolts (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the Jelali), backed by Iran and lasted until 1628. In 1733, the Iranian Nader Shah took Erzurum during the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian War (1730‚Äì35),John A Boyle. \\"Persia (RLE Iran A): History and Heritage\\" p 43 but if returned into Ottoman possession following his death in 1747. =Modern history= In 1821, during the last major Ottoman-Persian War, the Ottomans were crushingly defeated at Erzurum despite a numerical superiority by the Iranian Qajars at the Battle of Erzurum (1821).A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle, Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, 1140. In 1829 the city was captured by the Russian Empire, but was returned to the Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Adrianople (Edirne), in September of the same year. During the Crimean war Russian forces approached Erzurum, but did not attack it because of insufficient forces and the continuing Russian siege of Kars. The city was unsuccessfully attacked (Battle of Erzurum (1877)) by a Russian army in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78. However, in February 1878, the Russians took Erzurum without resistance, but it was again returned to the Ottoman Empire, this time under the Treaty of San Stefano. There were massacres of the city's Armenian citizens during the Hamidian massacres (1894‚Äì1896).Dadrian, Vahakn N. Warrant for Genocide: Key Elements of Turko-Armenian Conflict. New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1999, p. 141.  World War I and Turkish War of independence  The German Vice Concul of Erzurum Max Erwin von Scheubner‚ÄìRichter reported that between June 1915 and October 1915 the Armenian population was deported from the city. The city was also the location of one of the key battles in the Caucasus Campaign of World War I between the armies of the Ottoman and Russian Empires. This resulted in the capture of Erzurum by Russian forces under the command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich on February 16, 1916. Erzurum reverted to Ottoman control after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. In 1919, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, one of the key founders of the modern Turkish Republic, resigned from the Ottoman Army in Erzurum and was declared an \\"Honorary Native\\" and freeman of the city, which issued him his first citizenship registration and certificate (N√ºfus Cuzdanƒ±) of the new Turkish Republic. The Erzurum Congress of 1919 was one of the starting points of the Turkish War of Independence.See Richard G. Hovannisian, \\"The Competition for Erzerum, 1914‚Äì1921\\" in Armenian Karin/Erzerum, pp. 378ff. Erzurum, known as \\"The Rock\\" in NATO code, served as NATO's southeasternmost air force post during the Cold War.  Inspectorate General  In September 1935 Erzurum was made the seat of the newly created third Inspectorate General (Umumi M√ºfetti≈ülik, UM). The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars G√ºm√º≈ühane, Erzincan and Aƒürƒ±. It was governed by an Inspector General. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.  Ecclesiastical history  Theodosiopolis was important enough in the Late Roman province of Armenia Tertia to become a bishopric, which the Annuario Pontificio lists as suffragan of the Archdiocese of Comachus, but in Notitiae Episcopatuum from the seventh and early tenth centuries, its (later?) Metropolitan is the Archdiocese of Caesarea in Cappadocia.Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte und ungen√ºgend ver√∂ffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 536, n¬∫ 80, e p. 551, n¬∫ 112 In either case, it was in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Its historically recorded Suffragan Bishops were : * Petrus I, intervening at the council of 448 convoked by Patriarch Flavian of Constantinople in his see to condemn Archimandrite Eutyches as a heretic for his extreme opposition to Nestorianism * Manasse intervened at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 * Petrus II participated in the 533 dispute in Constantinople between 'orthodoxy' and Monophysitism * As ancient Theodosiopolis in Armenia (or \\"in Cappadocia\\"), the former bishopric remains a Latin Catholic titular see. = Council of Theodosiopolis (593) = After the long Byzantine-Sasanian War of 572-591, Byzantine rule was extended to all western parts of Armenia, and emperor Maurice (582-602) decided to strengthen political control over the region by supporting pro-Chalcedonian fraction of the Armenian Church. In 593, regional council of western Armenian bishops met in Theodosiopolis, proclaimed allegiance to the Chalcedonian Definition and elected John (Yovhannes, or Hovhannes) of Bagaran as new Catholicos of Chalcedonian Armenians. As Ancient Theodosiopolis in Armenia (or \\"in Cappadocia\\"), the former bishopric remains a Latin Catholic titular see, renamed as Titular Archiepiscopal See of Aprus. Its post is vacant since 1968, Antonio Gregorio Vuccino was its las Archbishop.  Economy  Erzurum Administrative Justice Palace One of the largest source of income and economic activity in the city has been Atat√ºrk University. Established in 1950, it is one of the largest universities in Turkey, having more than forty-thousand students. Tourism also provides a portion of the province's revenues. The city is a popular destination in Turkey for winter sports at the nearby Paland√∂ken Mountain. Erzurum is notable for the small-scale production of objects crafted from Oltu stone: most are sold as souvenirs and include prayer beads, bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings and hairclips. For now, Erzurum is the ending point of the South Caucasus Pipeline, also called the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) pipeline. Erzurum will also be the starting point of the planned Nabucco pipeline which will carry natural gas from the Caspian Sea basin to the European Union member states. The intergovernmental agreement between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria to build the Nabucco pipeline was signed by five Prime Ministers on 13 July 2009 in Ankara. The European Union was represented at the ceremony by the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso and the Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs, while the United States was represented by the Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy Richard Morningstar and the Ranking Member of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Senator Richard Lugar.

Biography He was born in Yonkers, New York. His father Francis N. Bangs was a lawyer in New York City, as was his brother, Francis S. Bangs. He went to Columbia College from 1880 to 1883 where he became editor of Columbia's literary magazine, Acta Columbia, and contributed short anonymous pieces to humor magazines. After graduation in 1883 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in Political Science, Bangs entered Columbia Law School but left in 1884 to become Associate Editor of Life under Edward S. Martin. Bangs contributed many articles and poems to the magazine between 1884 and 1888. During this period, Bangs published his first books. In 1888 Bangs left Life to work at Harper's Magazine, Harper's Bazaar and Harper's Young People, though he continued to contribute to Life. From 1889 to 1900 he held the title of Editor of the Departments of Humor for all three Harper's magazines and from 1899 to 1901 served as active editor of Harper's Weekly. Bangs also served for a short time (January‚ÄìJune 1889) as the first editor of Munsey's Magazine and became editor of the American edition of the Harper- owned Literature from January to November 1899. In 1894, Bangs ran for the office of mayor of Yonkers, New York, but was defeated. He also was a member of the Board of Education in Yonkers. He left Harper & Brothers in 1901 and became editor of the New Metropolitan magazine in 1903. In 1904 he was appointed editor of Puck, perhaps the foremost American humor magazine of its day. In this period, he revived his earlier interest in drama. In 1906 he switched his focus to the lecture circuit. During the period between 1901 and 1906 Bangs was known to have spent at least parts of his summers at the Profile HouseProfile House in Franconia Notch, whitemountainhistory.org in Franconia, New Hampshire. He owned one of the 20 connected cottages adjacent to the large hotel, which he sold to Cornelius Newton Bliss in August 1906. As a satirical writer, he was also known in the \\"Profile Cottage\\" circles as a jokester and prankster and was frequently the jovial topic of hotel guests and cottage owners alike. In 1918, he lectured for YMCA and allied troops on the battle front in France during World War I. In 1886, he married Agnes L. Hyde, with whom he had three sons. Agnes died in 1903. Bangs then married Mary Blakeney Gray of New York in 1904. In 1907 they moved from Yonkers to Ogunquit, Maine. John Kendrick Bangs died from stomach cancer in 1922 at age fifty-nine, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

It is the northwest terminal of the rapid transit Red Line (part of the MBTA subway system) and a hub for several MBTA bus routes. The station is located off Alewife Brook Parkway adjacent to the eastern end of the freeway portion of Massachusetts Route 2, with a five-story parking garage for park and ride use. Located at the confluence of the Minuteman Bikeway, Alewife Linear Park, Fitchburg Cutoff Path, and Alewife Greenway, the station has three bike cages. Alewife station is named after nearby Alewife Brook Parkway and Alewife Brook, themselves named after the alewife fish. The Fitchburg Railroad (now the MBTA Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line) opened through North Cambridge in 1842, followed by the now-closed Lexington Branch and Fitchburg Cutoff branch lines. An extension of the 1912-opened Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line to North Cambridge was first proposed in the 1930s, though planning for the project did not begin until the 1960s. The Red Line Northwest Extension project included a station at Alewife Brook Parkway to capture traffic from Route 2, as a planned extension of the highway was cancelled in 1970. Construction began in 1979; with the planned route to Arlington Heights rejected by Arlington, Alewife became the terminus of the extension. Alewife station opened on March 30, 1985, though some peak-hour service did not run to the station until that December. The station has a single underground island platform, with a busway and glass-roofed fare lobby inside the parking garage. Ramps connecting the garage to Route 2 opened in 1986. The station spurred transit-oriented development on formerly industrial land in the surrounding area. Although designed for two additional levels, the garage has not been expanded; repairs and elevator replacements began in 2018. The station features six works of public art built under the Arts on the Line program. Station layout The east headhouse in 2018 Alewife station has one underground island platform serving two tracks. Both tracks are used for boarding and alighting; a scissors crossover east of the station allows arriving and departing trains to switch tracks. A three-track underground yard extends about northwest past the station for use as layup tracks and overnight storage. A five-story, 2,733-space parking garage is located just west of the station platform, with vehicle entrance and exit at its northwest side. The first floor of the garage includes a -long enclosed bus platform with bus bays on both sides, as well as three bike cages. Pedestrian entrances to the garage are on the south (Cambridgepark Drive) and west (Steel Place) sides. A below- ground concourse runs east‚Äìwest under the garage, with ramps to the bus platform. East of the garage, the concourse widens into an atrium covered with a glass pyramid, with faregates and access to the platform on the north side. A freestanding headhouse connects to the east end of the platform. Elevators connect both ends of the platform to the fare lobbies, making the station fully accessible. The walls and floors of the station are finished with brown Welsh quarry tiles. The Minuteman Bikeway and Fitchburg Cutoff Path meet at the northwest corner of the garage; the Alewife Linear Park runs along the north side of the garage and past the east headhouse.  History  =Railroads= Construction of the Lexington Branch connector in 1926 The Charlestown Branch Railroad opened from Charlestown to Somerville in October 1839. It was extended to Fresh Pond in West Cambridge in 1842 for ice harvesting. Under the control of Alvah Crocker, the line was extended from West Cambridge to Fitchburg as the Fitchburg Railroad in 1843‚Äì45. Stops on the line included West Cambridge (Brick Yards) at Sherman Street, and Hills Crossing at Brighton Street just over the Belmont border to the west. The Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad (Lexington Branch) opened north from West Cambridge in 1846; the Watertown Branch opened south from West Cambridge in 1849. In 1870, the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&L;) bought the Lexington Branch to prevent it from being a competitor. The B&L; constructed a new line from near West Cambridge to Somerville Junction to connect the branch with its mainline. Among the stops on the new line was North Cambridge (North Avenue) at what is now Massachusetts Avenue. The Massachusetts Central Railroad (later Central Massachusetts Railroad) opened in 1881; it paralleled the Fitchburg west of Hills Crossing, then turned slightly north to meet the Lexington Branch at North Cambridge. The B&L; was acquired by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) in 1887, followed by the Fitchburg in 1900. In 1926‚Äì27, the B&M; built two new sections of track; these allowed the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad to use the Fitchburg mainline east of West Cambridge. On April 24, 1927, passenger service was rerouted over the rebuilt line; the Fitchburg Cutoff (Hills Crossing to Somerville Junction) became freight-only, with North Cambridge and the two other passenger stations on the line closed. Passenger service ended on the Watertown Branch in 1938. Hills Crossing station closed by the mid 1940s, and West Cambridge by the 1960s. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed in 1964 to support suburban rail service. A number of lightly-used branch lines were closed by the MBTA, with the Lexington Branch closing in January 1977. =Planning the Red Line= Alignments considered during the planning of the Northwest Extension. The chosen route was via Davis Square, with Alewife station at location B-5. The Arlington portion of the extension was not built. By 1922, the Boston Elevated Railway believed that would be the permanent terminus of the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line; the heavy ridership from the north was expected to be handled by extending rapid transit from Lechmere Square. A 1926 report proposed an extension from Lechmere to North Cambridge via the Southern Division and the Fitchburg Cutoff, with a possible further extension along the Lexington Branch. A northwards extension from Harvard to the North Cambridge/Arlington border was proposed by Cambridge mayor John D. Lynch in 1933 and by then-freshmen state representative Tip O'Neill in 1936, but was not pursued. The 1945 Coolidge Commission report ‚Äì the first major transit planning initiative in the region since 1926 ‚Äì recommended an extension from Harvard to Arlington Heights via East Watertown. The 1947 revision recommended an extension north to Porter Square instead, with branches along the Fitchburg Railroad to Waltham and the Lexington Branch to Lexington. (second section, third page) The 1966 Program for Mass Transportation called for an immediate extension to Alewife Brook Parkway (the eastern terminus of the Concord Turnpike) via Porter Square, with possible future extensions to Arlington or Waltham. Original plans called for a subway under Massachusetts Avenue to Porter Square, then a surface route along the Fitchburg Route to Alewife. In the late 1960s, the project was expanded to follow the Lexington Branch to a terminal at Route 128. By then, highway plans called for the Concord Turnpike (Route 2) to be expanded to eight lanes and extended east along the Fitchburg Line right-of-way to the proposed Inner Belt Expressway In 1970, then-governor Francis Sargent suspended most highway construction inside Route 128 and created the Boston Transportation Planning Review, which focused on the implementation of new transit routes. This placed increased pressure on a Red Line extension at least as far as a park-and-ride station at Alewife Brook Parkway to handle Route 2 traffic. By the mid-1970s, the project was split into two phases: an all-subway extension to Arlington Heights via Alewife, with a later extension to Route 128. Three general sites were considered for Alewife station, depending on the alignment of the whole project. Alternatives running via Garden Street or via Porter Square and the Fitchburg mainline were to have a station along the Lexington Branch just north of the Fitchburg mainline. Alternatives using the freight cutoff (via Davis Square or Cotter Square) were to have a station east of Alewife Brook Parkway on the pre-1927 Lexington Branch alignment, or to the south straddling the parkway. The chosen alignment was an all-tunnel route via Porter Square and Davis Square, with the southern station option. =Construction= The glass-roofed fare lobby in 2007 Intended primarily as a park-and-ride facility for suburban commuters, Alewife station was built on a former brickyard but adjacent to the terminus of Route 2. Although largely away from residential and commercial areas, the station was intended to be walkable from East Arlington and North Cambridge. The industrial site was chosen to minimize disruptive land takings. The station was designed by Ellenzweig Associates. After Davis and Porter, Alewife was among the first MBTA stations made accessible during initial construction, rather than by renovation. Alewife station was named for the adjacent Alewife Brook (a tributary of the Mystic River) and Alewife Brook Parkway ‚Äì themselves named for the alewife, a type of fish.long associated with the Massachusetts Bay area. By the time the Red Line Northwest Extension began construction in 1978, opposition in Arlington and reductions in federal funding had caused the MBTA to choose a shorter alternative with Alewife as the terminus. The Fitchburg Cutoff was abandoned in 1979 to allow construction of the extension. The station was constructed by the Perini Corporation. After six years of construction, Alewife was the final station on the extension to open. Revenue service began on March 30, 1985. Because the yard facilities were not complete, only Ashmont trains terminated at Alewife at peak hours; peak-hour Braintree trains ran only to Davis until December 26. Initially expected to cost $78 million to construct, the station ultimately cost $84 million. In 1989, the station was awarded a Federal Design Achievement Award by the National Endowment for the Arts, which stated that the \\"design surrounds all the activity with excitement and beauty... The entire structure is full of art...\\" When the station opened, all road access to the garage was from Alewife Brook Parkway, which forced those driving to the station on Route 2 to use a congested rotary north of the station. The design and construction of roadway improvements trailed that of the Red Line project, complicated by political controversy between Arlington, Belmont, and Cambridge over traffic concerns. The state announced a short-term plan in May 1984, under which the rotary would be replaced with a signalized intersection. A direct ramp from eastbound Route 2 to the garage would be built (following a short section of the former Lexington Branch), with a second ramp from the garage under Alewife Brook Parkway (reusing the Fitchburg Cutoff underpass) to the intersection. The $3.5 million project was approved by the MBTA board in June 1985; construction began that September and was completed about a year later. =Development and later changes= A 2015 aerial view of the Alewife garage (right) and nearby development Prior to the construction of Alewife station, the surrounding area was known as the \\"industrial triangle\\"; the only nearby development was the 1971-built Rindge Towers. Major development had been proposed in the triangle by Arthur D. Little in the 1960s, and by a 1970 city planning study. The construction of Alewife station resulted in what would later be termed transit-oriented development, with commercial developments replacing struggling industrial sites. The first developments around the station were primarily office buildings and high-tech research and development facilities that that flourished in Massachusetts in the 1980s. Developers were attracted to the Alewife area by the large plots of available land, the subway connection to Cambridge and Boston, and the proximity to Route 2. (second page) An additional development surrounding the east headhouse was considered in the mid-1980s, but was rejected by the community because it would have added 2,000 parking spaces. Residential developments were built in the Alewife triangle beginning in 2003. The Alewife Linear Park between Alewife and Davis opened in 1985. The Minuteman Bikeway opened in 1992‚Äì93 and was extended a short distance to Alewife in 1998, connecting the northwestern suburbs of Arlington, Lexington, and Bedford to Alewife along the former Lexington Branch right-of-way. (second page) Alewife became a major junction point between trails: The Fresh Pond Path to the south opened in the 1990s, the Alewife Greenway to the north in 2012, and the Fitchburg Cutoff Path to the west in 2013. The Minuteman quickly became a popular commuter route, necessitating additional bike storage at Alewife. On September 18, 2008, the MBTA opened two 150-bike parking cages on the ground level of the garage. A third cage was added around 2013 as the MBTA built bike cages at a number of stations. The parking garage frequently fills to capacity. In April 2008, the MBTA said that they did not have funds to add two levels to the parking garage, which would cost $30‚Äì35 million and add about 1300 spaces. The structure was originally designed to support two more levels, but whether the condition of the supports and building codes would still allow this expansion was not clear. In August 2018, the MBTA awarded a $5.7 million contract for garage repairs, which were needed even in the absence of funding for expansion. Work began in September 2018, and the main garage entrances were temporarily closed on October 19, 2019. Phased replacement of the garage elevators and the west platform elevator began in mid-2018, with completion planned for late 2020.  Arts on the Line  alt=A wavy wooden bench inside a parking garage In 1978, the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council began a program entitled Arts on the Line to add public art to new and renovated subway stations. For the Red Line Northwest Extension, 0.5% of the cost of the project was reserved for artworks. They were constructed of durable materials like stone and metal, designed to withstand vandalism as well as normal wear and tear for 75 years. Six of the original twenty artworks are located at Alewife station: * Untitled by Richard Fleischner ‚Äì A environmental work containing an artificial pond, large granite blocks, decorative pavers, and trees; located south of the garage * Alewife Wayside by David Davison ‚Äì of abstractly painted blue porcelain tiles on the wall of the south pedestrian ramp * Alewife Cows by Joel Janowitz ‚Äì A mural of a false exit to the bus platform with cows grazing in a pasture outside. * Untitled (Kiss and Ride) by William Keyser, Jr. ‚Äì Two maple sculptural benches for passengers waiting for pick-up at the station's \\"kiss and ride\\" areas on the ground level of the garage * The End of the Red Line by Alejandro and Moira Sina ‚Äì 1000 neon art tubes suspended from the ceiling over the north Red Line track * Untitled by Nancy Webb ‚Äì 100 -square bronze tiles with low relief images of plants and animals found in the Alewife Brook Reservation, scattered throughout the station lobby. The tiles depict \\"alewives (fish), frogs, song sparrows, dandelions, roses, snakes, toads, herons, and grasshoppers\\". An additional sculpture, not part of the Arts on the Line program, is located outside the south end of the garage.

MCP was originally written in 1961 in ESPOL (Executive Systems Programming Language). In the 1970s, MCP was converted to NEWP which was a better structured, more robust, and more secure form of ESPOL. The MCP was a leader in many areas, including: the first operating system to manage multiple processors, the first commercial implementation of virtual memory, and the first OS written exclusively in a high-level language. History In 1961, the MCP was the first OS written exclusively in a high-level language (HLL). The Burroughs Large System (B5000 and successors) were unique in that they were designed with the expectation that all software, including system software, would be written in an HLL rather than in assembly language, which was a unique and innovative approach in 1961. Unlike IBM, which faced hardware competition after the departure of Gene Amdahl, Burroughs software was designed to run only on proprietary hardware. For this reason, Burroughs was free to distribute the source code of all software it sold, including the MCP, which was designed with this openness in mind. For example, upgrading required the user to recompile the system software and apply any needed local patches. At the time, this was common practice, and was necessary as it was not unusual for customers (especially large ones, such as the Federal Reserve) to modify the program to fit their specific needs. The common form for software would be sources on tape or a disk pack generally you would have to recompile for your hardware from the common machine independent sources. This is in stark contrast to the common distribution of binaries only by IBM and others who generally closely guarded these software assets at the source level. This actually was necessary because this is the means by which the code accommodated local site differences in hardware, etc. As a result, a Burroughs Users Group was formed, which held annual meetings and allowed users to exchange their own extensions to the OS and other parts of the system software suite. Many such extensions have found their way into the base OS code over the years, and are now available to all customers. As such, the MCP could be considered one of the earliest open-source projects. Burroughs was not the first manufacturer to distribute source code and was a late entry to electronic computing (compared to its traditional rivals NCR, IBM, and Univac). Now that MCP runs on commodity hardware, some elements of the MCP based software suite are no longer made available in source form by Unisys. The MCP was the first commercial OS to provide virtual memory, which has been supported by the Burroughs large systems architecture since its inception. This scheme is unique in the industry, as it stores and retrieves compiler- defined objects rather than fixed-size memory pages, as a consequence of its overall non-von Neumann and uniformly stack-based architecture. File system The MCP provides a file system with hierarchical directory structures. In early MCP implementations, directory nodes were represented by separate files with directory entries, as other systems did. However, since about 1970, MCP internally uses a 'FLAT' directory listing all file paths on a volume. This is because opening files by visiting and opening each directory in a file path was inefficient and for a production environment it was found to be better to keep all files in a single directory, even though they retain the hierarchical naming scheme. Programmatically, this makes no difference. The only difference visible to users is that an entity file can have the same name as a directory. For example, \\"A/B\\" and \\"A/B/C\\" can both exist; \\"B\\" can be both a node in a file and a directory. Files are stored on named volumes, for example 'this/is/a/filename on myvol', 'myvol' being the volume name. This is device independent, since the disk containing 'myvol' can be moved or copied to different physical disk drives. Disks can also be concatenated so that a single volume can be installed across several drives, as well as mirrored for recoverability of sensitive data. For added flexibility, each program can make volume substitutions, a volume name may be substituted with a primary and secondary alternate name. This is referred to as the process‚Äô FAMILY. For instance, the assignment ‚ÄúFAMILY DISK = USERPACK OTHERWISE SYSPACK‚Äù stores files logically designated on volume DISK onto the volume USERPACK and will seek files first on volume USERPACK. If that search has no success, another search for the file is done on volume SYSPACK. DISK is the default volume name if none is specified. Each file in the system has a set of file attributes. These attributes record all sorts of meta data about a file, most importantly its name and its type (which tells the system how to handle a file, like the more limited four-character file type code on the Macintosh). Other attributes have the file's record size (if fixed for commercial applications), the block size (in multiples of records that tells the MCP how many records to read and write in a single physical IO) and an area size in multiples of blocks, which gives the size of disk areas to be allocated as the file expands. The file type indicates if the file is character data, or source code written in particular languages, binary data, or code files. Files are protected by the usual security access mechanisms such as public or private, or a file may have a guard file where the owner can specify complex security rules. Another security mechanism is that code files can only be created by trusted compilers. Malicious programmers cannot create a program and call it a compiler ‚Äì a program could only be converted to be a compiler by an operator with sufficient privileges with the 'mc' make compiler operator command. The MCP implements a Journaling file system, providing fault tolerance in case of disk failure, loss of power, etc. It is not possible to corrupt the file system (except by the operating system or other trusted system software with direct access to its lower layers) . The file system is case-insensitive and not case-preserving unless quotes are added around the name in which case it is case-sensitive and case-preserving. Process management MCP processes are called \\"Jobs\\" and \\"Tasks.\\" A Job contains one or more tasks. Tasks within a job can run sequentially or in parallel. Logic can be implemented at the Job level, typically in the MCP's Job Control Language WFL, to control the flow of a job. Once all tasks in a job are complete, the job itself is completed. An MCP Process goes through a life cycle from the time it enters the system until it leaves. The initial state for a Job is \\"Queued.\\" There is a period of time while the Job resides in one of several user defined Job Queues. The next state is \\"Scheduled\\" as the Job moves from a queue into memory. Tasks within a job do not wait in queue; instead going directly to the 'Scheduled' state when initiated. Once a Job or Task is started, it can transition between \\"Active,\\" \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Scheduled\\" as it progresses. Once a Job or Task completes, it moves to the 'Completed' state. Running processes are those that use a processor resource and are marked as 'running'. Processes that are ready to be assigned to a processor, when there is no free processor are placed in the ready queue. Processes may be assigned a ‚ÄúDeclared‚Äù or ‚ÄúVisible‚Äù priority, generally 50 as the default, but can be from 0 to 99 for user processes. System processes may be assigned the higher values. Note that this numerical priority is secondary to an overall priority, which is based on the task type. Processes that are directly part of the operating system, called Independent Runners, have the highest priority regardless of numeric priority value. Next come processes using an MCP lock, then Message Control Systems such as CANDE. Then Discontinued processes. Then Work Flow Language jobs. Finally come user processes. At a lower level, there is a Fine priority intended to elevate the priority of tasks that do not use their full processor slice. This allows an IO bound task to get processor time ahead of a processor bound task on the same declared priority. Processes that are waiting on other resources, such as a file read, wait on the EVENT data structure. Thus all processes waiting on a single resource wait on a single event. When the resource becomes available, the event is caused, which wakes up all the processes waiting on it. Processes may wait on multiple events for any one of them to happen, including a time out. Events are fully user programmable ‚Äì that is, users can write systems that use the generalized event system provided by the MCP. Processes that have terminated are marked as completed. Operationally, the status of all tasks in the system is displayed to the operator. All running and ready processes are displayed as 'Active' tasks (since the system implements preemptive multitasking, the change from ready to running and back is so quick that distinguishing ready and running tasks is pointless because they will all get a slice of the processor within a second). All active tasks can be displayed with the 'A' command. Terminated tasks are displayed as completed tasks with the reason for termination, EOT for normal 'end of task', and DSed with a reason for a process failure. All processes are assigned a mix number, and operators can use this number to identify a process to control. One such command is the DS command (which stands for either Delete from Schedule, DiScontinue, or Deep Six, after the influence of Navy personnel on early computer projects, depending on who you talk to). Tasks terminated by the operator are listed in the complete entries as O-DS. Tasks can also terminate due to program faults, marked as F-DS or P-DS, for faults such as invalid index, numeric overflow, etc. Completed entries can be listed by the operator with the 'C' command. Tasks waiting on a resource are listed under the waiting entries and the reason for waiting. All waiting tasks may be listed with the 'W' command. The reason for waiting is also listed and more information about a task may be seen with the 'Y' command. It may be that a task is waiting for operator input, which is sent to a task via the accept 'AX' command (note that operator input is very different from user input, which would be input from a network device with a GUI interface). Tasks waiting on user input or file reads would not normally be listed as waiting entries for operator attention. Another reason for a task to be waiting is waiting on a file. When a process opens a file, and the file is not present, the task is placed in the waiting entries, noting that it is waiting on a certain file. An operator (or the user that owns the process) has the opportunity either to copy the file to the expected place, or to redirect the task to read the file from another place, or the file might even be created by an independent process that hasn't yet completed. If the resource cannot be provided by the operator, the operator can DS the task as a last resort. This is different from other systems, which automatically terminate a task when a resource such as a file is not available. The MCP provides this level of operator recoverability of tasks. Other systems force programmers to add code to check for the presence of files before accessing them, and thus extra code must be written in every case to provide recoverability, or process synchronization. Such code may be written in an MCP program when it is not desirable to have a task wait, but because of the operator-level recoverability, this is not forced and therefore makes programming much simpler. In addition to the ability to dynamically remap file (or database) requests to other files (or databases), before or during program execution, several mechanisms are available to allow programmers to detect and recover from errors. One way, an 'ON' statement, has been around for many years. Specific faults (e.g., divide by zero) can be listed, or the catch-all 'anyfault' can be used. The statement or block following the 'ON' statement is recognized by the compiler as fault-handling code. During execution, if a recoverable fault occurs in scope of the 'on' statement, the stack is cut back and control transferred to the statement following it. One problem with the handling logic behind the ON statement was that it would only be invoked for program faults, not for program terminations having other causes. Over time, the need for guaranteed handling of abnormal terminations grew. In particular, a mechanism was needed to allow programs to invoke plug-ins written by customers or third parties without any risk should the plug-in behave badly. In addition to general plug-in mechanisms, the new form of dynamic library linkage (Connection Libraries) allows programs to import and export functions and data, and hence one program runs code supplied by another. To accomplish such enhanced protection, a newer mechanism was introduced in the mid 1990s. In a misguided attempt at compatibility, it was named after the then-proposed C++ language construct of the same name. Because the syntax and behavior of the two differ to such a large extent, choosing the same name has only led to confusion and misunderstanding. Syntactically, 'try' statements look like 'if' statements: 'try', followed by a statement or block, followed by 'else' and another statement or block. Additional 'else' clauses may follow the first. During execution, if any recoverable termination occurs in the code following the 'try' clause, the stack is cut back if required, and control branches to the code following the first 'else'. In addition, attributes are set to allow the program to determine what happened and where (including the specific line number). Most events that would result in task termination are recoverable. This includes stack overflow, array access out-of-bounds, integer over/under flow, etc. Operator (or user) DS is not recoverable except by privileged tasks using an UNSAFE form of try. MCP thus provides a very fault-tolerant environment, not the crash-and-burn core-dump of other systems. As with file attributes, tasks have attributes as well, such as the task priority (which is assigned at compile time or execution time, or can be changed while the task is running), processor time, wait time, status, etc. These task attributes can be accessed programmatically as can file attributes of files. The parent task is available programmatically as a task attribute that is of type task. For example, 'myself.initiator.name' gives the name of the process that initiated the current process. \`GETSPACE\` and \`FORGETSPACE\` are the two main procedures handling memory allocation and deallocation. Memory needs to be allocated at process initiation and whenever a block is entered that uses arrays, files, etc. \`GETSPACE\` and \`FORGETSPACE\` not only handle memory space, they also allocate or deallocate the disk space where non memory resident data may be overlaid. Memory may be SAVE (i.e., memory resident), OVERLAYABLE (i.e., virtual memory) or STICKY (meaning memory resident, but movable). They are called upon e.g. by \`HARDWAREINTERRUPT\` when a process addresses an uninitialized array or by \`FILEOPEN\`. \`HARDWAREINTERRUPT\` handles hardware interrupts and may call upon \`GETSPACE\`, \`IO_FINISH\` or the like. \`BLOCKEXIT\` is called upon by a task exiting a block. BLOCKEXIT may in turn call \`FILECLOSE\`, \`FORGETSPACE\` or the like while cleaning up and releasing resources declared and used within that block. J_EDGAR_HOOVER is the main security guardian of the system, called upon at process start, file open, user log on, etc. \`GEORGE\` is the procedure that decides which process is the next one to receive CPU resources and is thus one of the few processes that uses the MoveStack instruction. A task goes through various states starting with NASCENT. At DELIVERY the event BIRTH is caused and the task's state changes to ALIVE. When PROCESSKILL is called upon, the state changes into DISEASED. When DEATH is caused the task gets put into the queue structure the MORGUE, after which all remaining resources are freed to the system by a process called PROCESSKILL. While the task is ALIVE, MCP functions are run on top of that particular process, thus CPU resources are automatically charged to the task causing the MCP overhead. Also, much of the MCP work is being performed with that particular stack's security rights. Only before BIRTH and after DEATH does the MCP need to be operating out of some other stack. If none is available, the system maintains an idle stack. Software components and libraries MCP libraries provide a way of sharing data and code between processes. The article on Burroughs large systems looks at the way dependent processes could be asynchronously run so that many processes could share common data (with the mechanisms to provide synchronized update). Such a family of related processes had to be written as a single program unit, processing procedures at higher lex levels as the asynchronous processes, which could still access global variables and other variables at lower lex levels. Libraries completely inverted this scenario with the following advantages: * Libraries and independent processes are written as independent programming units * Libraries completely controlled access to shared resources (data encapsulation and hiding) * Libraries and clients could be written in different languages * Process switching was not required to safely access data So clean and radical was the library mechanism that much system software underwent major rewrites resulting in a better structured systems and performance boosts. Libraries were introduced to MCP systems in the early 1980s, having been developed by Roy Guck and others at Burroughs. They are very much like C. A. R. Hoare's monitors and provide the opportunity for controlled mutual exclusion and synchronization between client processes, using MCP EVENTs and the Dahm locking technique. Libraries offer procedural entry-points to the client, which are checked for a compatible interface (all parameters and return types of imported procedures checked) before the client is linked to the library. The library and its client may be written in different languages. The advantage is that all synchronization is provided in the library and client code does not need to worry about this level of programming at all. This results in robust code since clients can't undermine the synchronization code in the library. (Some would call this a 'Trusted Computing Initiative'.) Libraries are more sophisticated forms of libraries on other systems such as DLLs. MCP libraries can be 'shared by all', ‚Äòshared by rununit‚Äô or 'private'. The private case is closest to libraries on other systems ‚Äì for each client a separate copy of the library is invoked and there is no data sharing between processes. Shared by all is more interesting. When a client starts up, it can run for a while until it requires the services in the library. Upon first reference of a library entry-point, the linkage is initiated. If an instance of the library is already running, the client is then linked to that instance of the library. All clients share the same instance. Shared by rununit is a sharing mechanism in between these two sharing schemes. It was designed specifically for COBOL, where a rununit is defined as the original initiating client program and all the libraries it has linked to. Each rununit gets one instance of the library and different rununits get a different instance. This is the only dynamic implementation of COBOL rununits. If this was the first invocation of the library the library would run its main program (outer block in an ALGOL program) to initialize its global environment. Once initialization was complete, it would execute a freeze, at which point all exported entry points would be made available to clients. At this point, the library's stack was said to be frozen since nothing more would be run on this stack until the library became unfrozen, in which case clean-up and termination code would be run. When a client calls a routine in a library, that routine runs on top of the client stack, storing its locals and temporary variables there. This allows many clients to be running the same routine at the same time, being synchronized by the library routine, which accesses the data in the global environment of the library stack. Freeze could also be in three forms ‚Äì temporary, permanent and controlled. Temporary meant that once the client count dropped to zero, the library would be unfrozen and terminated. Permanent meant that the library remained available for further clients even if the client count dropped to zero ‚Äì permanent libraries could be unfrozen by an operator with a THAW command. A controlled freeze meant that the library actually kept running, so that it could execute monitoring functions and perform data initialization and cleanup functions for each linking client. Libraries could also be accessed 'by title' and 'by function'. In 'by title' the client specified the file name of the library. 'By function' was an indirect method where a client would just specify the function name of the library, for example 'system_support' and the actual location of the library is found in a table previously set up by an operator with 'SL' (system library) commands, for example 'SL system_support = *system/library/support'. MCP's fault tolerant attitude also works here ‚Äì if a client tries accessing a library that is not present, the client is put in the 'waiting' tasks and the library could be made present, or the request redirected. Libraries can also be updated on the fly, all that needs to be done is to 'SL' the new version. Running clients will continue to use the old version until they terminate and new clients will be directed to the new version. Function libraries also implemented a very important security feature, linkage classes. All normal libraries have a linkage class of zero. Libraries used by the MCP or other privileged system modules may not be usable from normal programs. They are accessed by function and forced in linkage class one. A client in linkage class zero cannot link to linkage class one entry-points. A library with linkage class one that needs to offer entry- points to normal programs can do so if it is designated as ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô. It can offer selected entry-points in linkage class zero. The entire database system is implemented with libraries providing very efficient and tailored access to databases shared between many clients. The same goes for all networking functionality and system intrinsics. In the mid-1990s a new type of library was made available: Connection Libraries. These are programs in their own right that can execute independently as well as import and export data and functions to other programs in arrays of structure blocks. For example, the networking component of the operating system is available as a connection library, allowing other programs to use its services by exporting and importing functions. Upon linkage, each client gets a dedicated structure block to keep state information in. A program that uses the network might import a network-write function and export a network-read function. Thus, if you open a network connection (e.g., using TCP), when data arrives for you to read, the networking component can directly call your function to consume it, without having to first copy the data to a buffer and do a context switch. Likewise, you can write data to the network by directly calling a network- write function. Connection Libraries allow a significant degree of control over linkages. Each side of a linkage can optionally approve a linkage and can sever the linkage as desired. State can be easily maintained per linkage as well as globally. Port files Another technique for inter-process communication (IPC) is port files. They are like Unix pipes, except that they are generalized to be multiway and bidirectional. Since these are an order of magnitude slower than other IPC techniques such as libraries, it is better to use other techniques where the IPC is between different processes on the same machine. The most advantageous use of port files is therefore for distributed IPC. Port files were introduced with BNA (Burroughs Network Architecture), but with the advent of standard networking technologies such as OSI and TCP/IP, port files can be used with these networks as well. A server listening for incoming connections declares a port file (a file with the KIND attribute equal to PORT). Each connection that is made from a client creates a subfile with an index, so each port file represents multiple connections to different clients around the network. A server process receives client requests from anywhere on the network by issuing a read on the port file (subfile = 0 to read from any subfile). It issues a response to the client that issued the request by writing to the particular subfile from which the request was read. Operating environment The MCP also provides a sophisticated yet simple operator environment. For large installations, many operators might be required to make physical resources, such as printers (loading paper, toner cartridges, etc.) available. Low-end environments for small offices or single user may require an operator-free environment (especially the laptop implementation). Large systems have dedicated operations terminals called ODTs (Operator Display Terminals), usually kept in a secure environment. For small systems, machines can be controlled from any terminal (provided the terminal and user have sufficient privileges) using the MARC program (Menu Assisted Resource Control). Operator commands can also be used by users familiar with them. Operator commands are mostly two letters (as with Unix), and some are just one letter. This means that the operator interface must be learned, but it is very efficient for experienced operators who run a large mainframe system from day to day. Commands are case insensitive. Tasks are entered in the program 'mix' and identified by mix numbers, as are libraries. To execute a program, operators can use the 'EX' or 'RUN' command followed by the file name of the program. ODTs are run typically with ADM (Automatic Display Mode), which is a tailorable display of system status usually set up to display the active, waiting, and completed mix entries, as well as system messages to the operator for notifications or situations requiring operator action. Complete listing of these displays are given by the 'A' (active), 'W' (waiting), 'C' (completed), and 'MSG' (message commands). If a task becomes waiting on some operator action, the operator can find out what the task needs by entering its mix number followed by the 'Y' command. (Note the object-oriented style of commands, selecting the object first, followed by the command.) For example, '3456Y'. An operator can force a task into the waiting entries with the stop command '3456ST' and make it active again with OK: '3456OK'. The OK command can also be used when an operator has made a resource available for a task, although more frequently than not, the MCP will detect that resources have become available, CAUSE the EVENT that processes have been waiting on without further operator intervention. To pass textual information from an operator to a program, the accept command ‚Äò3456AX MORE INFO‚Äô can be used. Programs can pass information to operators using the DISPLAY mechanism, which causes DISPLAY messages to be added to the MSG display. As well as tasks and processes, operators also have control over files. Files can be listed using the FILE command, copied using COPY, removed using REMOVE, and renamed. The operating environment of the MCP is powerful, yet simple and usually only requires a fraction of the number of operators of other systems. An important part of the operations environment is the high-level Work Flow Language. Logging All actions in the system are logged, for example all messages displayed to the operator, and all operator actions. All significant program actions are optionally logged in a system log and a program log, for example BOJ for beginning of a WFL job, BOT for beginning of a task within a WFL job, EOT and EOJ for end of tasks and jobs. As well, all file and database open and closes can be logged. Logging many events contributes to an apparent slowness of the MCP operating environment compared to systems like Unix, since everything is logged with forced physical writes to the program log after every record, which is what systems like Unix don‚Äôt do, even though they too keep many things in the system logs. The logs can be used for forensics to find out why programs or systems may have failed, or for detecting attempts to compromise system security. System logs are automatically closed after a system-settable period and a new one opened. System logs contain a huge amount of information, which can be filtered and analyzed with programs such as LOGANALYZER. The DUMPANALYZER analyzes memory dumps that were originally written to tape. As all compilers added LINEINFO into the code-files, the DUMPANALYZER is able to pinpoint exactly which source statement was being executed at the time of error. Also a normal program dump, where just one program was dumped, contains information on source-code sequence number and variable names. The two analyzers are major diagnostic tools for all kinds of purposes. Innovations Beyond the many technical innovations in the MCP design, the Burroughs Large Systems had many management innovations now being used by the internet community at large. The system software was shipped to customers inclusive of source code and all the editing and compilation tools needed to generate new versions of MCP for customers. Many customers developed niche expertise on the inner workings of the MCP, and customers often sent in the 'patches' (fragment pieces of source code with sequence numbers) as suggestions of new enhanced features or fault corrections (FTR - field trouble reports). Many of the suggested patches were included by the systems developers and integrated into the next version of the MCP release. Including a community of voluntary, self-professed experts, into mainstream technical work, is now widely practised and is the essence of Open Innovation. This management innovation of community development dated back to the 1970s.

Summary The MCP was the first OS developed exclusively in a high- level language. Over its 50-year history, it has had many firsts in a commercial implementation, including virtual memory, symmetric multiprocessing, and a high-level job control language (WFL). It has long had many facilities that are only now appearing in other widespread operating systems, and together with the Burroughs large systems architecture, the MCP provides a very secure, high performance, multitasking and transaction processing environment.

Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style. The term is used in a variety of fields e.g. software design, urban design, architecture, landscape architecture, product design, sustainability, graphic design, planning, and even medicine as a way of creating environments that are more responsive and appropriate to their inhabitants' and users' cultural, emotional, spiritual and practical needs. It is one approach to placemaking. Recent research suggests that designers create more innovative concepts and ideas when working within a co-design environment with others than they do when creating ideas on their own. Participatory design has been used in many settings and at various scales. For some, this approach has a political dimension of user empowerment and democratization. For others, it is seen as a way of abrogating design responsibility and innovation by designers. In several Scandinavian countries, during the 1960s and 1970s, participatory design was rooted in work with trade unions; its ancestry also includes action research and sociotechnical design.Web Page on Participatory Design on the site of CPSR. Retrieved 13 April 2006. Definition In participatory design, participants (putative, potential or future) are invited to cooperate with designers, researchers and developers during an innovation process. Potentially, they participate during several stages of an innovation process: they participate during the initial exploration and problem definition both to help define the problem and to focus ideas for solution, and during development, they help evaluate proposed solutions. Maarten Pieters and Stefanie Jansen describe co-design as part of a complete co-creation process, which refers to the \\"transparent process of value creation in ongoing, productive collaboration with, and supported by all relevant parties, with end-users playing a central role\\" and covers all stages of a development process. =Differing terms= In \\"Co-designing for Society\\", Deborah Szebeko and Lauren Tan list various precursors of co-design, starting with the Scandinavian participatory design movement and then state \\"Co-design differs from some of these areas as it includes all stakeholders of an issue not just the users, throughout the entire process from research to implementation.\\" In contrast, Elizabeth Sanders and Pieter Stappers state that \\"the terminology used until the recent obsession with what is now called co- creation/co-design\\" was \\"participatory design\\".Sanders, E. and Stappers, P. J: \\"Co-creation and the new landscapes of design.\\" CoDesign 2008. 4(1): 5-18. History From the 1960s onwards there was a growing demand for greater consideration of community opinions in major decision-making. In Australia many people believed that they were not being planned 'for' but planned 'at'. (Nichols 2009). A lack of consultation made the planning system seem paternalistic and without proper consideration of how changes to the built environment affected its primary users. In Britain 'the idea that the public should participate was first raised in 1965' (Taylor, 1998, p. 86). However the level of participation is an important issue. At a minimum public workshops and hearings have now been included in almost every planning endeavour. Yet this level of consultation can simply mean information about change without detailed participation. Involvement that 'recognises an active part in plan making' (Taylor, 1998, p. 86) has not always been straightforward to achieve. Participatory design has attempted to create a platform for active participation in the design process, for end users. =History in Scandinavia= Participatory design was actually born in Scandinavia and called cooperative design. However, when the methods were presented to the US community 'cooperation' was a word that didn't resonate with the strong separation between workers and managers - they weren't supposed to discuss ways of working face-to-face. Hence, 'participatory' was instead used as the initial Participatory Design sessions weren't a direct cooperation between workers and managers, sitting in the same room discussing how to improve their work environment and tools, but there were separate sessions for workers and managers. Each group was participating in the process, not directly cooperating. (in historical review of Cooperative Design, at a Scandinavian conference). In Scandinavia, research projects on user participation in systems development date back to the 1970s. The so-called \\"collective resource approach\\" developed strategies and techniques for workers to influence the design and use of computer applications at the workplace: The Norwegian Iron and Metal Workers Union (NJMF) project took a first move from traditional research to working with people, directly changing the role of the union clubs in the project. The Scandinavian projects developed an action research approach, emphasizing active co-operation between researchers and workers of the organization to help improve the latter's work situation. While researchers got their results, the people whom they worked with were equally entitled to get something out of the project. The approach built on people's own experiences, providing for them resources to be able to act in their current situation. The view of organizations as fundamentally harmonious‚Äîaccording to which conflicts in an organization are regarded as pseudo-conflicts or \\"problems\\" dissolved by good analysis and increased communication‚Äîwas rejected in favor of a view of organizations recognizing fundamental \\"un-dissolvable\\" conflicts in organizations (Ehn & Sandberg, 1979). In the Utopia project (B√∏dker et al., 1987, Ehn, 1988), the major achievements were the experience-based design methods, developed through the focus on hands-on experiences, emphasizing the need for technical and organizational alternatives (B√∏dker et al., 1987). The parallel Florence project (Gro Bjerkness & Tone Bratteteig) started a long line of Scandinavian research projects in the health sector. In particular, it worked with nurses and developed approaches for nurses to get a voice in the development of work and IT in hospitals. The Florence project put gender on the agenda with its starting point in a highly gendered work environment. The 1990s led to a number of projects including the AT project (B√∏dker et al., 1993) and the EureCoop/EuroCode projects (Gr√∏nb√¶k, Kyng & Mogensen, 1995). In recent years, it has been a major challenge to participatory design to embrace the fact that much technology development no longer happens as design of isolated systems in well-defined communities of work (Beck, 2002). At the dawn of the 21st century, we use technology at work, at home, in school, and while on the move. =Co-design= Co-design is often used by trained designers who recognize the difficulty in properly understanding the cultural, societal, or usage scenarios encountered by their user. C. K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy are usually given credit for bringing co-creation/co-design to the minds of those in the business community with the 2004 publication of their book, The Future of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value with Customers. They propose: :\\"The meaning of value and the process of value creation are rapidly shifting from a product and firm-centric view to personalized consumer experiences. Informed, networked, empowered and active consumers are increasingly co-creating value with the firm.\\" The phrase co-design is also used in reference to the simultaneous development of interrelated software and hardware systems. The term co-design has become popular in mobile phone development, where the two perspectives of hardware and software design are brought into a co-design process. Results directly related to integrating co-design into existing frameworks is \\"researchers and practitioners have seen that co-creation practiced at the early front end of the design development process can have an impact with positive, long-range consequences.\\"Sanders, E. B. N., & Stappers, P. J. (2008). Co-creation and the new landscapes of design. Codesign, 4(1), 5-18. Discourses Discourses in the PD literature have been sculpted by three main concerns: (1) the politics of design, (2) the nature of participation, and (3) methods, tools and techniques for carrying out design projects. (Finn Kensing1 & Jeanette Blomberg, 1998, p. 168) = Politics of design = The politics of design have been the concern for many design researchers and practitioners. Kensing and Blomberg illustrate the main concerns which related to the introduction of new frameworks such as system design which related to the introduction of computer-based systems and power dynamics that emerge within the workspace. The automation introduced by system design has created concerns within unions and workers as it threatened their involvement in production and their ownership over their work situation. = Nature of participation = Major international organizations such as Project for Public Spaces create opportunities for rigorous participation in the design and creation of place, believing that it is the essential ingredient for successful environments. Rather than simply consulting the public, PPS creates a platform for the community to participate and co-design new areas, which reflect their intimate knowledge. Providing insights, which independent design professionals such as architects or even local government planners may not have. Using a method called Place Performance Evaluation or (Place Game), groups from the community are taken on the site of proposed development, where they use their knowledge to develop design strategies, which would benefit the community. \\"Whether the participants are schoolchildren or professionals, the exercise produces dramatic results because it relies on the expertise of people who use the place every day, or who are the potential users of the place.\\"Projects for Public Spaces http://www.pps.org/info/services/our_approach/building_the_vision Building The Vision May 15, 2009 This successfully engages with the ultimate idea of participatory design, where various stakeholders who will be the users of the end product, are involved in the design process as a collective. Similar projects have had success in Melbourne, Australia particularly in relation to contested sites, where design solutions are often harder to establish. The Talbot Reserve in the suburb of St. Kilda faced numerous problems of use, such as becoming a regular spot for sex workers and drug users to congregate. A Design In, which incorporated a variety of key users in the community about what they wanted for the future of the reserve allowed traditionally marginalised voices to participate in the design process. Participants described it as 'a transforming experience as they saw the world through different eyes.' (Press, 2003, p. 62). This is perhaps the key attribute of participatory design, a process which, allows multiple voices to be heard and involved in the design, resulting in outcomes which suite a wider range of users. It builds empathy within the system and users where it is implemented, which makes solving larger problems more holistically. As planning affects everyone it is believed that 'those whose livelihoods, environments and lives are at stake should be involved in the decisions which affect them' (Sarkissian and Perglut, 1986, p. 3) = In the built environment = A public consultation event about urban planning in Helsinki Participatory design has many applications in development and changes to the built environment. It has particular currency to planners and architects, in relation to placemaking and community regeneration projects. It potentially offers a far more democratic approach to the design process as it involves more than one stakeholder. By incorporating a variety of views there is greater opportunity for successful outcomes. Many universities and major institutions are beginning to recognise its importance. The UN, Global studio involved students from Columbia University, University of Sydney and Sapienza University of Rome to provide design solutions for Vancouver's downtown eastside, which suffered from drug- and alcohol-related problems. The process allowed cross-discipline participation from planners, architects and industrial designers, which focused on collaboration and the sharing of ideas and stories, as opposed to rigid and singular design outcomes. (Kuiper, 2007, p. 52) Public Interest Design is a design movement, extending to architecture, with the main aim of structuring design around the needs of the community. At the core of its application is participatory design. Through allowing individuals to have a say in the process of design of their own surrounding built environment, design can become proactive and tailored towards addressing wider social issues facing that community. Public interest design is meant to reshape conventional modern architectural practice. Instead of having each construction project solely meet the needs of the individual, public interest design addresses wider social issues at their core. This shift in architectural practice is a structural and systemic one, allowing design to serve communities responsibly. Solutions to social issues can be addressed in a long-term manner through such design, serving the public, and involving it directly in the process through participatory design. The built environment can become the very reason for social and community issues to arise if not executed properly and responsibly. Conventional architectural practice often does cause such problems since only the paying client has a say in the design process. That is why many architects throughout the world are employing participatory design and practicing their profession more responsibly, encouraging a wider shift in architectural practice. Several architects have largely succeeded in disproving theories that deem public interest design and participatory design financially and organizationally not feasible. Their work is setting the stage for the expansion of this movement, providing valuable data on its effectiveness and the ways in which it can be carried out. From community consultation to community design Many local governments require community consultation in any major changes to the built environment. Community involvement in the planning process is almost a standard requirement in most strategic changes. Community involvement in local decision making creates a sense of empowerment. The City of Melbourne Swanston Street redevelopment project received over 5000 responses from the public allowing them to participate in the design process by commenting on seven different design options.The City of Melbourne Have Your Say May 14, 2009 While the City of Yarra recently held a 'Stories in the Street'Andrea Cook Stories in the Street May 14, 2009 consultation, to record peoples ideas about the future of Smith Street. It offered participants a variety of mediums to explore their opinions such as mapping, photo surveys and storytelling. Although local councils are taking positive steps towards participatory design as opposed to traditional top down approaches to planning, many communities are moving to take design into their own hands. Portland, Oregon City Repair ProjectCity Repair \\"What is City repair\\" May 13, 2009 is a form of participatory design, which involves the community co-designing problem areas together to make positive changes to their environment. It involves collaborative decision- making and design without traditional involvement from local government or professionals but instead runs on volunteers from the community. The process has created successful projects such as intersection repair, which saw a misused intersection develop into a successful community square. Peer-to-peer urbanism\\"P2P Urbanism\\", collection of articles is a form of decentralized, participatory design for urban environments and individual buildings. It borrows organizational ideas from the open-source software movement, so that knowledge about construction methods and urban design schemes is freely exchanged. =In software development= In the English-speaking world, the term has a particular currency in the world of software development, especially in circles connected to Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), who have put on a series of Participatory Design Conferences. It overlaps with the approach Extreme Programming takes to user involvement in design, but (possibly because of its European trade union origins) the Participatory Design tradition puts more emphasis on the involvement of a broad population of users rather than a small number of user representatives. Participatory design can be seen as a move of end-users into the world of researchers and developers, whereas empathic design can be seen as a move of researchers and developers into the world of end-users. There is a very significant differentiation between user-design and user-centered design in that there is an emancipatory theoretical foundation, and a systems theory bedrock (Ivanov, 1972, 1995), on which user-design is founded. Indeed, user-centered design is a useful and important construct, but one that suggests that users are taken as centers in the design process, consulting with users heavily, but not allowing users to make the decisions, nor empowering users with the tools that the experts use. For example, Wikipedia content is user-designed. Users are given the necessary tools to make their own entries. Wikipedia's underlying wiki software is based on user-centered design: while users are allowed to propose changes or have input on the design, a smaller and more specialized group decide about features and system design. Participatory work in software development has historically tended toward two distinct trajectories, one in Scandinavia and northern Europe, and the other in North America. The Scandinavian and northern European tradition has remained closer to its roots in the labor movement (e.g., Beck, 2002; Bjerknes, Ehn, and Kyng, 1987). The North American and Pacific rim tradition has tended to be both broader (e.g., including managers and executives as \\"stakeholders\\" in design) and more circumscribed (e.g., design of individual features as contrasted with the Scandinavian approach to the design of entire systems and design of the work that the system is supposed to support) (e.g., Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998; Noro and Imada, 1991). However, some more recent work has tended to combine the two approaches (B√∏dker et al., 2004; Muller, 2007). Processes, procedures and methods =Distributed participatory design= Distributed participatory design (DPD) is a design approach and philosophy that supports the direct participation of users and other stakeholders in system analysis and design work. Nowadays design teams most often are distributed, which stress a need for support and knowledge gathered from design of distributed systems. Distributed participatory design aims to facilitate understanding between different stakeholders in distributed design teams by giving each the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities. Forms of distributed participatory design, or mass-participatory design, are now most frequently seen online. Web-based, mass-participatory design platforms are increasingly seen in both the consumer product and architectural design industries, facilitating direct public engagement at multiple stages of the design process.Lorimer, A.O.D. Mass-participation Architecture, Pearl, 2016, [online] https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk//handle/10026.1/5293 [17/08/16] Website designs and planning now incorporate social networking into their interfaces to increase distributed participation. This integration helps \\"funnel\\" or redirect traffic towards a website or group of websites, increasing website exposure, traffic, and the number of access points to a website. By providing users with multiple venues for interacting with and giving feedback to companies, content creators, and other users online have been able to strengthen networks and online communities. The interconnectivity factor of online participatory design encourages users to engage in participation on websites outside those they regularly visit enabling the connection, strengthening, and creation of online communities and fandoms. On social networking websites, companies and creators create specialized pages or accounts for interacting with any users and consumers more directly and in more readily usable forms, as opposed to older methods of retrieving feedback. Through using various websites, users can participate in the design process with the medium they are most comfortable using, accommodating differences in technical background and navigating unfamiliar websites. Feedback can typically be seen in the form of comment sections, rating systems, or reviews from which companies and content creators may determine possible future changes in design and organization. Not only does this make evaluation and feedback by users easier, but also serves as a way to more efficiently categorize and process the information in a more effective and organized manner. The use of distributed participatory design on the internet has eliminated many of the intermediate steps between a consumer's response and the company's reception thus decreasing transaction costs. In terms of distributed participatory design, YouTube and their content creators, or YouTubers, incorporate many of these elements into their website designs and planning. Video pages contain a 'share' function that allows for individuals to circulate a link to a video through various social media sites to increase exposure and possibly redirect people to other sites content creators use for circulating media and for receiving reactions. Additionally, feedback can appear in the form of comments and ratings. Each video has separate comment sections for users to leave input and ideas in. YouTube also uses a rating system of thumbs up/thumbs down to provide the content creators with a statistic on how well a video was received.

Akre and Wilson are featured in the 2003 documentary film The Corporation which includes a section about the same lawsuit. Professional life Akre began her career at a small radio station as a news reporter and occasional disc jockey in 1978. She moved around the country as a news reporter and news anchor until spending some time at CNN.InjuryBoard.com biography: Jane Akre. URL accessed 8 April 2010. Following her firing from WTSP, she joined WTVT, a Fox Broadcasting Company affiliate.Reason: \\"The Strange Case of Steve Wilson,\\" John Sugg, May 2006 issue. Following her issues with WTVT, she took a series of jobs and was featured in The Corporation regarding her whistleblower lawsuit. In 2007 Akre became the editor-in-chief of the national news desk at InjuryBoard.com. Whistleblower lawsuit In 1997, Wilson and Akre began work on a story regarding the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto and recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a milk additive that had been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration but also blamed for a number of health issues. Wilson and Akre planned a four-part investigative report on Monsanto's use of rBGH, which prompted Monsanto to write to Roger Ailes, president of Fox News Channel, in an attempt to have the report reviewed for bias and because of the \\"enormous damage that can be done\\" as a result of the report. WTVT did not run the report, and later argued in court that the report was not \\"breakthrough journalism\\". Wilson and Akre then claimed that WTVT's actions constituted the news broadcast telling lies, while WTVT countered that it was looking only for fairness. According to Wilson and Akre, the two rewrote the report over 80 times over the course of 1997, and WTVT decided to exercise \\"its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause,\\"New World Communs. of Tampa, Inc. v. Akre, 866 So. 2d 1231(2003) and did not renew their contracts in 1998. WTVT later ran a report about Monsanto and rBGH in 1998, and the report included defenses from Monsanto. When their contracts were not renewed, Wilson and Akre filed a lawsuit concerning WTVT's alleged news distortion under Florida's whistleblower laws, claiming their termination was retaliation for \\"resisting WTVT's attempts to distort or suppress the Monsanto recombinant bovine growth hormone story.\\" In a joint statement, Wilson claimed that he and Akre \\"were repeatedly ordered to go forward and broadcast demonstrably inaccurate and dishonest versions of the story,\\" and \\"were given those instructions after some very high-level corporate lobbying by Monsanto (the agriculture company that makes the hormone) and also ... by members of Florida‚Äôs dairy and grocery industries.\\"Prepared Statement: Steve Wilson and Jane Akre, 2 April 1998. URL accessed 8 April 2010. The trial commenced in summer 2000 with a jury dismissing all of the claims brought to trial by Wilson, but siding with one aspect of Akre's complaint, awarding Akre $425,000 and agreeing that Akre was a whistleblower because she believed there were violations of the Communications Act of 1934 and because she planned on reporting WTVT to the Federal Communications Commission. An appeal was filed, and a ruling in February 2003 came down in favor of WTVT, who successfully argued that the FCC policy against falsification was not a \\"law, rule, or regulation\\", and so the whistle-blower law did not qualify as the required \\"law, rule, or regulation\\" under section 448.102 of the Florida Statutes.Florida Laws: FL Statutes ‚Äì Title XXXI Labor Section 448.01 Legal day's work; extra pay ... Because the FCC's news distortion policy is not a \\"law, rule, or regulation\\" under section 448.102 of the Florida Statutes, Akre has failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute.\\" The appeal did not address any falsification claims, noting that \\"as a threshold matter ... Akre failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower's statute,\\" but noted that the lower court ruled against all of Wilson's charges and all of Akre's claims with the exception of the whistleblower claim that was overturned. The 2003 documentary, The Corporation, , which was a 2 hr and 24 minute documentary, included a 10-minute section on Wilson and Akre discussing their battle with WTVT, with Wilson claiming that the jury \\"determined that the story they pressured us to broadcast, the story we resisted telling, was in fact false, distorted, or slanted.\\"The Corporation. Project Censored called their story one of the \\"Most Censored Stories\\" of 2003, claiming that the \\"Court Ruled That the Media Can Legally Lie.\\"Project Censored : The Media Can Legally Lie. 2003. URL accessed 8 April 2010. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. later quoted Wilson in his book, Crimes Against Nature, with Wilson asking \\"[W]hat reporter is going to challenge a network ... if the station can retaliate by suing the reporter to oblivion the way the courts are letting them do to us?\\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Crimes Against Nature. 2004, Harper Collins Publishers, p182. Wilson and Kennedy both failed to note that Wilson and Akre originally brought the suit. Following the story, Akre and Wilson won the Goldman Environmental Prize for the report, as well as an Ethics in Journalism Award from the Society of Professional Journalists.Society of Professional Journalists for Performing in an Outstanding Ethical Manner. The two continued to challenge WTVT's license, the last such challenge coming in 2005. The two lost that final challenge with the FCC in July 2007 calling the conflict an \\"editorial dispute ... rather than a deliberate effort by [WTVT] to distort news.\\"http://cltampa.com/tampa/wilson-akres-fcc-challenge- dismissed/Content?oid=2027397 References See also *Journalism ethics and standards *Journalism Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American editors American women editors American women journalists ","title":"Jane Akre"},{"id":"966260","title":"Low (band)"},{"id":"966261","text":"Harvard is a rapid transit and bus transfer station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Located at Harvard Square, it serves the MBTA's Red Line subway system as well as MBTA buses. Harvard averaged 18,528 entries each weekday in FY2019, making it the third-busiest MBTA station and the busiest outside the four downtown \\"hub\\" stations. Only and handled more passengers. It is also an important transfer point, with subway, bus, and trackless trolley (trolleybus) service all connecting at the station. Five of the fifteen key MBTA bus routes stop at the station. Harvard station is located directly beneath Harvard Square, a transportation, business, and cultural focal point in Cambridge. The Red Line rail platforms lie underneath Massachusetts Avenue just north of the center of the square. Many connecting surface transit routes are served by the Harvard bus tunnel, which runs on the west side of the station. The primary station entrance leads to a central atrium fare lobby under Harvard Square; there is also a secondary fare lobby for the Red Line toward the north end of the station, with entrances at Church Street and opposite it, near Harvard's Johnston Gate; and an unpaid entrance to the bus tunnel at Brattle Square. Station layout Red Line platforms viewed from the secondary fare mezzanine: the outbound platform is to the left, with the inbound platform visible below to the right. Harvard station has a complex structure located largely under triangular Harvard Square, from which Massachusetts Avenue runs to the north and east and Brattle Street to the southwest, and under the surrounding streets. The main lobby is located under the square itself, and approximately matches its triangular shape. The glass-and-steel main headhouse is located in a sunken concrete plaza at the south end of the square. The plaza, locally known as \\"the Pit\\", plays host to homeless people, street artists, skateboarders, and activists. Passengers descend eastward from the headhouse on a bank of stairs and elevators, then turn and descend northwest on a second escalator bank into the lobby. An elevator is located adjacent to the headhouse; the station is fully accessible. The Red Line platforms are located on two stacked levels, north of the square under Massachusetts Avenue. The outbound (northbound) track is above and slightly east of the inbound track; both have side platforms on their west sides. These split platforms run from near the south end of Harvard University's Straus Hall to the south part of Flagstaff Park near Garden Street. A pair of ramps lead from the main lobby - which has faregates on its north side - to the platforms. A secondary fare lobby is located above the middle of both platforms, with small brick headhouses on both sides of Massachusetts Avenue at Church Street near Johnston Gate. =Bus tunnel= A route 78 bus on the upper level of the bus tunnel Immediately west of the subway platforms is the -long Harvard bus tunnel, used by MBTA buses and trackless trolleys. Like the Red Line, it is split into two stacked tunnel levels; the northbound level is above and slightly east of the southbound level. Both levels have platforms on their east side, located under Brattle Street southwest of the main lobby. A pair of ramps connect the main station lobby to the platforms; a small set of stairs also connects the lower platform to the west side of the lobby. A headhouse and an elevator to the upper level are located at Eliot Square at the southwest end of the platform. The south portal of the tunnel is located on Mount Auburn Street; it runs slightly west of Brattle Street to Harvard Square, then northward along the west side of Massachusetts Avenue. The north portal is located inside Flagstaff Park near the south end of Cambridge Common, with an incline to the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Cambridge Street. The Harvard bus tunnel is equipped with dual overhead wires to power trackless trolleys, as well as ventilation fans to remove diesel exhaust. Buses using compressed natural gas (CNG) are banned from the tunnel (because lighter-than-air CNG can collect and cause a gas explosion in the event of a leaking tank), as are all non-MBTA vehicles. The platform is located on the left side for southbound buses (routes 71 and 73 boarding, and a number of terminating routes). MBTA trolleybuses are equipped with an additional left-hand door for boarding on this level; because this door does not have a farebox, passengers instead pay while alighting from routes 71 and 73. Because other buses using the tunnel do not have left-hand doors, passengers must alight next to the wall and cross in front of the bus. On Sundays, trolleybuses are replaced with diesel buses, and only the upper busway is used. Bennett Alley, a private alley south of Mount Auburn Street, is used for layovers and for northbound buses to access the tunnel from Bennett Street.  History  =Original station= A train at the original Harvard station in 1912 Horse-drawn omnibus service between Harvard Square in Cambridge and downtown Boston began in 1826. The hourly service soon increased to ten-minute headways to meet demand. In late 1849, the Fitchburg Railroad opened the Harvard Branch Railroad, with a Harvard Square station near where Austin Hall is now located. With only six daily round trips, the branch failed to compete with the omnibus service and was closed in 1855. On March 26, 1856, the Cambridge Railroad began horse-drawn tram service between Harvard Square and Bowdoin Square - the first such service in the Boston area. Following the opening of its Beacon Street line earlier that year, the West End Street Railway began electric streetcar service on the North Cambridge‚ÄìBowdoin Square line on February 16, 1889. Murray Street Carhouse was built for the new electric cars. The West End (which was acquired by the Boston Elevated Railway in 1897) rapidly expanded its electric operations, including other lines meeting at Harvard Square. After the success of the 1897-opened Tremont Street Subway, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) planned an elevated system with lines to Cambridge, South Boston, Charlestown, and Roxbury. The latter two lines opened in 1901 as the Charlestown Elevated and Washington Street Elevated, while the South Boston line was determined to be infeasible. After debate about running an elevated line above business districts in Cambridge, the BERy agreed in late 1906 to built a line under Beacon Hill in Boston, over a new West Boston Bridge, and under Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge to Harvard Square. Construction began on May 24, 1909. The Cambridge Subway opened from Harvard Square to Park Street Under on March 23, 1912, with intermediate stations at Central Square and Kendall Square. The two-level underground Harvard Square station largely matched the triangular shape of Harvard Square. The subway platforms were oriented east-west under Massachusetts Avenue at the east end of the station, with the outbound (unloading) platform above and slightly north of the inbound platform. The outbound platform was long and at least wide; the inbound platform was long and at least wide to accommodate passengers waiting for trains. West of the platforms, the tracks merged onto a single level, with a pocket track between them. This three-track tunnel ran southwest under Brattle Street to Eliot Shops; outbound trains could reverse direction at the pocket track or continue to the yard. A two-level streetcar tunnel formed the west part of the station, with platforms long. The southbound (lower) level was for streetcars running on Mount Auburn Street, while the northbound level was for streetcars running on Massachusetts Avenue and Garden Street. The streetcar platforms were divided into unloading and loading sections for the through-routed streetcar lines, allowing separation of passenger flows in opposite directions. This philosophy was used throughout the station, with dedicated one-way transfer passages between trains and streetcars in all directions. All passages were level or sloped downwards for ease of movement, and stairs were only necessary for entering or exiting the station at the surface. The platforms and floors were made of granolithic. Station walls were tiled with white enamel, with a red tile band above the floor and white plaster above. The exit to Harvard Yard also had dark granite inside and black marble at the surface. Early plans called for a monument-like headhouse in Harvard Square matching that of Scollay Square station. However, a one-story, oval-shaped brick and stone entrance/exit structure was constructed instead. Like the rest of the Cambridge Subway, it was designed by a committee of architects led by Robert Peabody. Additional entrances were located on the south side of Massachusetts Avenue east of Holyoke Street, and inside a BERy waiting room on the south face of the square. Secondary exits were located on the northeast side of the square (later in front of Lehman Hall) and on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue east of the square near the Wadsworth House. The original headhouse was replaced by a smaller struture in 1928. Otherwise, the station was little changed until the 1970s. =Streetcar tunnel= With an eight-minute running time between Harvard Square, the Cambridge Subway was fifteen minutes faster than surface streetcars. No longer needing to run to downtown Boston, lines from the north and west were truncated to Harvard Square. The streetcar tunnel served lines to Watertown, Waverley Square, Belmont, Huron Avenue, and Arlington Heights via North Cambridge. Some lines were through-routed: Arlington Heights with Watertown, and North Cambridge line with Waverley and Belmont; the Huron Avenue line terminated at Bennett Yard. Lines to Lechmere Square, Kendall Square, and Boston continued to use surface tracks in the square. On May 4, 1912, Lexington and Boston Street Railway cars from Lowell began using the tunnel. This lasted until the line was replaced by buses (later becoming MBTA route 62) in 1924. By 1922, 104 streetcars per hour (24 single cars and 40 two-car trains) ran northbound through the tunnel during the afternoon peak. In response to overcrowding, the BERy extended the loading section of the northbound platform from to and widened the existing portion, doubling its area. Construction work started in late 1922 and was finished in 1923. At that time, the BERy believed that Harvard would be the permanent terminus; the heavy ridership from the north was expected to be handled by extending rapid transit from Lechmere Square. Bus routes added in the 1920s and 1930s (including the 1925 conversion of the Harvard-Kendall line) originally stopped on the surface. Trackless trolleys (trolleybuses) began to use the tunnel with the conversion of the Huron Avenue streetcar line (now route ) on April 2, 1938. (The Harvard‚ÄìLechmere line ‚Äì now route ‚Äì was converted in 1936, but it continued to run on the surface because of road geometry.) The busy Arlington Heights line (now route ) was converted to surface-stopping diesel buses on November 19, 1955. In the late 1950s, the MTA (which had replaced the BERy in 1947) needed additional streetcars to run the new Riverside Line (which opened in 1959), but no domestic manufacturers were still producing PCC streetcars. The City of Cambridge also planned road work that would interrupt streetcar service, and wished to eliminate \\"safety islands\\" (where passengers boarded streetcars) from Massachusetts Avenue. The MTA replaced Arborway-based trolleybus lines with diesel buses, then transferred the trolleybuses to replace the Harvard-based streetcars. Some off-peak and Sunday service was replaced in 1956, followed by Cushing Square short turn service in 1957. On September 5, 1958, the Watertown () and Waverley () lines and the North Cambridge short turns (now route ) were replaced with trolleybuses, ending streetcar service through the tunnel. The four trolleybus routes (sometimes considered three, as most trips on the 71 and 73 were through-routed with North Cambridge trips) continued to use the tunnel. As of 2006, it was one of only two urban trolleybus subways (tunnels with stations) in the world, following the end of trolleybus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel in 2005; the other is the South Boston Transitway. (The College Hill Tunnel, in Providence, Rhode Island, was used by trackless trolleys from 1948 to 1953, but had no stations. The use of the Essen premetro subway in Germany by trolleybuses ended in 1995, and the Kanden Tunnel and Tateyama Tunnel in Japan were non-urban trolleybus tunnels.) On March 30, 1963, the MTA replaced all remaining trolleybus routes except for the Harvard-based routes with diesel buses. The Harvard tunnel was closed on Sundays, with trolleybuses replaced by diesel buses operating on the surface. Original plans had called for the trolleybuses to be replaced by diesel buses at all times, but this was delayed while the MTA investigated methods to ventilate the tunnel. Diesel buses equipped with early catalytic mufflers were tested from 1962 to 1964, with the hope of eliminating most surface bus traffic from Harvard Square. In January 1965, catalytic-muffler-equipped diesel buses on route 77 began using the tunnel, followed by route 96 in March 1966. However, the trolleybus lines were never replaced with diesel buses. =Maintenance facilities= The BERy constructed a pair of rail yards on a site bordered by Eliot Street, Bennett Street, University Road, Charles River Road, and Boylston Street, to the southwest of Harvard Square. Much of the site had occupied by BERy and West End Street Railway streetcar barns; the area had been used for horsecar facilities since at least 1871. The rest of the site, which had once been marshland, was occupied by private buildings. The west half of the site was occupied by Bennett Street Yard, a storage and maintenance facility for streetcars. It included a 16-track, carhouse that could hold 92 streetcars, plus an open-air storage yard. Bennett opened on March 30, 1911, replacing nearby Boylston Street and Murray Street carhouses. The eastern half of the site housed the Eliot Square Shops, used for storage and maintenance of the Cambridge Subway rolling stock. It had a three-track machine shop and five covered maintenance tracks, plus open-air storage tracks. The whole facility covered , including the shop building and the -wide yard. Footings were built between the yard tracks to allow for future air rights development. On the west side of the shop building, a single track ran up a ramp to Bennett Yard. Nicknamed \\"Bancroft Hall\\" (after BERy president William Bancroft) by employees, the shop building was used to assemble the forty new subway cars. Eliot Square Shops cost $1.00 million (equivalent to $ million in ) out of the total $11.75 million cost of the Cambridge Subway. On the east side of the yard, the BERy constructed a concrete platform for special service to events such as the Harvard football games at Harvard Stadium. Known as Stadium station, it had a main ramp entrance/exit at the south end, plus eight smaller stair entrance/exits along the east wall. It was not open for regular use and did not have turnstiles; instead, employees collected all fares. Fully staffing the station took 49 employees, including 24 ticket sellers and 12 ticket choppers. Stadium station could handle 26,000 passengers in 45 minutes after a game, with trains running every 1 minutes. The architecture of the station was designed by Robert S. Peabody. It first opened for a home game versus Brown on October 26, 1912; the last known use was on November 18, 1967 for the final home game of the 1967 Harvard football season. BERy also constructed a brick division headquarters building, later known as the Conductor's Building, in Bennett Alley between the yard and the streetcar tunnel. It was used by the BERy and its successors until around 2000; in 2014-2016, the building was renovated for use as a restaurant. It is the last remaining aboveground building from the 1912 construction of the Cambridge tunnel. The Harvard Square power station, which was built for streetcars in 1897, was located adjacent to Eliot Shops across Boylston Street. It had a substantial coal trestle for freight streetcars to deliver coal. A steam tunnel ran west from the power station under Eliot and Bennett yards, supplying steam power to both. The power station was largely unused by the time it was sold to Harvard University in 1929; the university built Eliot House on the site in 1931. In April 1924, the BERy converted the East Boston Tunnel (later the Blue Line from streetcars to high-platform metro rolling stock. A small maintenance facility was built underground near Maverick station, but more extensive work was performed at Eliot Shops. Cars were brought to the surface at a portal west of Bowdoin station, towed on surface tracks on Cambridge Street and the Longfellow Bridge, and transferred onto the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line tracks at a gate near the west end of the bridge. This was done until April 25, 1952, when the new maintenance facility at Orient Heights eliminated the need for the transfer. Beginning in 1956, Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan Line streetcars were towed to Eliot Shops behind Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line trains after the abandonment of surface lines severed the connection to Arborway Yard. This continued until a maintenance facility was built at Mattapan in 1971. The BERy purchased a private garage adjacent to Bennett Yard in October 1931; it was reopened on July 28, 1932 as a garage for BERY maintenance trucks. Pavement was laid around several tracks in Bennett Yard in 1936 and 1938 for use by trolleybuses, and several yard tracks were removed in 1942 and 1949. Until it was reassigned to Reservoir Carhouse in 1940, the Lake Street line had been based out of Bennett Street, requiring a long deadhead move along Cambridge Street to Lechmere. After the last Bennett-based streetcar lines were replaced with trolleybuses in 1958, the facility was used solely by trolleybuses and diesel buses. All trolleybus maintenance was performed at Bennett, though some were also stored at North Cambridge Carhouse. In October 1958, the MTA sold the east part of Bennett Yard to the city of Cambridge, which used the paved area as public parking. Around 1963, John F. Kennedy originally proposed to build his presidential library near Harvard, on the south side of the Charles River. In June 1964, then-city councilman Alfred Vellucci proposed to instead locate the library on the site of the Bennett and Eliot railyards, on the northern side of the river. The MTA had begun offering this site for sale the previous year, with Harvard University and several real estate developers developing bids, as the agency planned for a replacement maintenance facility either near South Station or as part of the planned northwestern Red Line extension. Shortly after being selected as architect in December 1964, I.M. Pei indicated an interest in the yard site, and it was chosen over a smaller southern site in mid-1965. In January 1966, governor John A. Volpe signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the yards from the now-renamed MBTA, and in turn to give the site to the federal government for the library. However, delays with the Red Line extension project caused corresponding delays with the purchase. The MBTA ultimately purchased land near South Station for its new Red Line maintenance facility in December 1969. Cabot Yard opened in June 1974, freeing the Eliot Shops site for development. However, community opinion had by then turned against placing the library in Harvard Square because of concerns about traffic and crowding; in November 1975, the Kennedy Library Corporation voted to instead place the library at Columbia Point near UMass Boston. Eliot Shops closed in 1976, with demolition beginning on December 22. Bennett Yard closed on March 22, 1980, replaced by new maintenance facilities at North Cambridge and Watertown Yard. In October 1978, the first building of a new John F. Kennedy School of Government complex opened on the southern half of the site. The new buildings were constructed on fill atop the concrete base of the yard. A single segment of wall reading BOSTON ELEVATED RAILWAY CO. 1911 remained in the courtyard of the Kennedy School until a 2015-17 expansion project. The abandoned tunnel to Eliot Shops under Brattle Street is still extant and used for MBTA storage. = Former stations = Simplified map of the current and former stations There have been a total of five stations on the Red Line in and around Harvard Square. The original Harvard station was located just east of the current station, and some remains exist. The original station closed permanently on January 30, 1981. The surviving eastern end of the original outbound side platform, built to accommodate passengers alighting at the former terminus, is still visible from passing trains. The 1945 Coolidge Commission report - the first major transit planning initiative in the region since 1926 - recommended an extension from Harvard to Arlington Heights via East Watertown. The 1947 revision recommended an extension north to Porter Square instead, with branches along the Fitchburg Railroad to Waltham and the Lexington Branch to Lexington. (second section, third page) The 1966 Program for Mass Transportation by the 1964-created MBTA called for an immediate extension to Alewife Brook Parkway via Porter Square, with possible future extensions to Arlington or Waltham. During the construction of the current Harvard station, two temporary stations were built. \\"Harvard/Brattle\\", a temporary station built of pressure-treated wood, consisted of two island platforms between three tracks in Eliot Yard, just outside the portal. A $1.4 million construction contract was approved on December 7, 1977, with a groundbreaking ceremony on January 23, 1978. The station was open from March 24, 1979 to September 1, 1983, and was the northern terminus of the Red Line during that period. The temporary station was completely demolished, and parts of the Kennedy School of Government now occupy the space. \\"Harvard/Holyoke\\" station was located in the main Red Line tunnel east of the current station, at Massachusetts Avenue and Holyoke Street. Although it served inbound passengers only, the temporary station was fully built with tile walls and other durable details. It was open from January 31, 1981, to September 1, 1983. The abandoned side platform is still visible from inbound Red Line trains. = Current station = The fare mezzanine of the modern station The Church Street secondary entrance to the new station opened on September 6, 1983. The main lobby and the new Harvard Square headhouse opened on March 2, 1985. (The reconstructed former headhouse had been returned to the square and occupied by Out of Town News in 1984.) The artworks at Harvard and the three new stations were dedicated on May 3, 1985. The renovated busway opened on September 7, 1985, completing the $72 million construction project. The bus platforms had been moved to the south (occupying part of the former tunnel to Eliot Square Shops) and renovated during the six-year closure of the tunnel. The northern ramp of the tunnel was also rebuilt during the closure. In addition to the route previously using the tunnel, bus routes , , and were rerouted into the tunnel. (Route , which remained on the surface, began using the tunnel northbound only in 2008.) A memorial plaque honoring John H. \\"Muggsie\\" Kelly, a construction foreman who was killed during a crane collapse during construction in May 1982, was dedicated in October 1985. The One Brattle Square shopping complex, opened in 1992, was constructed partially on air rights over the south end of the bus tunnel. Harvard Square was planned to be the terminus of a spur of the Urban Ring Project, a circumferential bus rapid transit line. Northbound buses would have crossed the Lars Anderson Bridge and entered the bus tunnel via Eliot Street, Bennett Street, and Bennett Alley. Southbound buses would start at the Dawes Island bus stop, then proceed on the surface on Eliot Street and JFK Street back to the bridge. The project was cancelled in 2010 due to high cost. The MBTA agreed to build a new elevator at the south end of the upper busway at Eliot Square, and to replace the Harvard Square elevator, as part of the 2006 settlement of Joanne Daniels- Finegold, et al. v. MBTA. Construction of the Eliot Square elevator began in mid-2010. The $4.1 million project, which provided redundant elevator access to the station, was completed in January 2012. The main elevator in Harvard Square was closed in 2018 for an 18-month replacement with a larger glass elevator. The new elevator, which has copper sheeting on the kiosk, opened on October 31, 2019. A project to make repairs to the deteriorated pavement, replace the trolleybus wire, replace lighting, improve wayfinding, and add automatic doors to the main station area is taking place in 2019 and 2020. On June 23, 2019, the upper busway was temporarily closed; most buses used the lower busway for boarding and surface stops for alighting, while routes 71 and 73 ran on the surface only. The upper busway reopened and the lower busway closed on October 21. The lower busway reopened on November 22, with the upper busway again closed until December 21. A second closure of the lower busway took place from March 31 to May 2, 2020, as decreased ridership during the coronavirus pandemic allowed for faster construction, and a third closure began June 21. Improvements to wayfinding signage began in 2020.

Arts on the Line was devised to bring art into the MBTA's subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar arrangements to fund public art across the country.Red Line Northwest Extension Pamphlet page 5.

It is situated on the B4380 (the old A5), 5 miles south east of Shrewsbury. The River Severn flows around the village. To the south is the village of Cross Houses, and to the north west the hamlet of Emstrey. Local governance It once belonged and gave its name to Atcham Rural District, before that was merged into the Borough of Shrewsbury in 1974, and the village came under Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council. From 2009, Shrewsbury and Atcham was merged with the other districts of non-metropolitan Shropshire to form Shropshire Council. The Parliamentary constituency which covers the borough remains as Shrewsbury and Atcham. In terms of population, Atcham is the smallest village represented in the name of a UK Parliamentary constituency. History The only church in England to be dedicated to Saint Eata, bishop of Hexham, can be found in the village. The reasoning behind the dedication is unclear. There is no written record suggesting that he ever came so far south. There is, however, a crop photograph from the 1970s of a field in Attingham Park showing the ground plan of a Saxon palace identical to one excavated near Hexham. \\"Atcham\\" is a contraction of \\"Attingham\\", meaning \\"the home of Eata's people\\". The church building dates back to the 11th century. The local airfield RAF Atcham (now returned to agriculture and light industry) was home to an American training unit for much of World War II. It used P-47 Thunderbolts and later P-38 Lightnings for operational training of new fighter pilots posted in from the United States. Almost 50 pilots were lost in accidents flying from there. The A5 London‚ÄìHolyhead road once ran through the village, but now runs to the north on a new dual-carriageway. Notable people In order of birth: *Ordericus Vitalis (1075 ‚Äì c. 1142), chronicler and Benedictine monk, was baptised in the village.ODNB Retrieved 27 March 2018. *Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick (1745‚Äì1789), politician and landowner, builder of Attingham Park, was buried in the village church. *Anna Kingsford (1846‚Äì1888), first female English medical graduate and vegetarian, was buried in the village church. *Digby Tatham-Warter (1917‚Äì1993), Second World War British Army officer famed for carrying an umbrella *Dick Sale (1919‚Äì1987), first-class cricketer and school headmaster, was born in the village. Features The two bridges at Atcham Famous landmarks at Atcham include Attingham Park, seat of the Berwick barons until the title became extinct in 1953. The hall at Attingham Park is now the regional headquarters of the National Trust. Also on the estate is the Shropshire office of Natural England. Adjacent to Attingham Park is Home Farm Attingham. Home Farm, now separate from the hall that it traditionally would have supplied, is a family- run organic farm and tea room open to the public. There are two bridges at Atcham, the older one, built in 1774, being commonly known as Atcham Bridge, while the newer one, which was opened in 1929, carries the Old A5 (B4380) road over the River Severn. Nearby, outside the parish to the east, is the village of Wroxeter, formerly a Roman city, and currently the site of one of Shropshire's commercial vineyards. The Mytton & Mermaid, located in the centre of the village on the bank of the river Severn. There is a public house in the village called the Mytton & Mermaid (owned at one time by Clough Williams- Ellis as a staging post on the way to his iconic Italianate village of Portmeirion), but the school, post office and petrol station have all closed. The former garage remains as a small car-sales and vehicle-repair business. Atcham has a timber-framed village hall named the Malthouse, built in the 17th century as such, but after disuse converted in the 19th century into carpenter's shop for the Attingham estate. It was opened after restoration in 1925 as the village hall and dedicated to the memory of the men of Atcham who had died in World War I. It has a sprung floor bought from a dance hall in Shrewsbury. Nearby is Atcham Business Park/Industrial Estate, on the site of the old airfield. Despite its name, it lies in the neighbouring civil parish of Wroxeter and Uppington, although after the Diocese of Lichfield made some boundary changes, it is now in the ecclesiastical parish of Atcham.

Adams and by his initials F.P.A.. Famed for his wit, he is best known for his newspaper column, \\"The Conning Tower\\", and his appearances as a regular panelist on radio's Information Please. A prolific writer of light verse, he was a member of the Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s and 1930s. New York newspaper columnist Adams was born Franklin Leopold Adams to Moses and Clara Schlossberg Adams in Chicago on November 15, 1881. He changed his middle name to \\"Pierce\\" when he had a Jewish confirmation ceremony at age 13.Ashley, Sally. F.P.A.: The Life and Times of Franklin Pierce Adams. Beaufort, 1986. p. 25. Adams graduated from the Armour Scientific Academy (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1899, attended the University of Michigan for one year and worked in insurance for three years. Signing on with the Chicago Journal in 1903, he wrote a sports column and then a humor column, \\"A Little about Everything.\\" The following year he moved to the New York Evening Mail, where he worked from 1904 to 1913 and began his column, then called \\"Always in Good Humor,\\" which used reader contributions. During his time on the Evening Mail, Adams wrote what remains his best known work, the poem \\"Baseball's Sad Lexicon,\\" a tribute to the Chicago Cubs double play combination of \\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\\" In 1911, he added a second column, a parody of Samuel Pepys's Diary, with notes drawn from F.P.A.'s personal experiences. In 1914, he moved his column to the New- York Tribune, where it was famously retitled The Conning Tower and was considered to be \\"the pinnacle of verbal wit.\\" During World War I, Adams was in the U.S. Army, serving in military intelligence and also writing a column, \\"The Listening Post,\\" for Stars and Stripes editor Harold Ross. After the war, the so-called \\"comma-hunter of Park Row\\"Ashley, p. 13. (for his knowledge of the language) returned to New York and the Tribune. He moved to the New York World in 1922, and his column appeared there until the paper merged with the inferior New York Telegram in 1931. He returned to his old paper, by then called the New York Herald Tribune, until 1937, and finally moved to the New York Post, where he ended his column in September 1941. During its long run, \\"The Conning Tower\\" featured contributions from such writers as Robert Benchley, Edna Ferber, Moss Hart, George S. Kaufman, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker and Deems Taylor. Having one's work published in \\"The Conning Tower\\" was enough to launch a career, as in the case of Dorothy Parker and James Thurber. Parker quipped, \\"He raised me from a couplet.\\" Parker dedicated her 1936 publication of collected poems, Not So Deep as a Well, to F.P.A. Many of the poems in that collection were originally published in \\"The Conning Tower.\\" Much later, the writer E. B. White freely admitted his sense of awe: \\"I used to walk quickly past the house in West 13th Street between Sixth and Seventh where F.P.A. lived, and the block seemed to tremble under my feet‚Äîthe way Park Avenue trembles when a train leaves Grand Central.\\"White, E.B. Here Is New York. Harper & Bros., 1949. p. 32. Adams is credited with coining the term \\"aptronym\\" for last names that fit a person's career or job title, although it was later refined to \\"aptonym\\" by Frank Nuessel in 1992. Satires *No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris directed by Nikita Balieff. :Robert Benchley is often credited as the first person to suggest the parody of Balieff's group. :No Sirree! had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin. Acts included: \\"Opening Chorus\\" featuring Woollcott, Toohey, Kaufman, Marc Connelly, Adams, and Benchley with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; \\"He Who Gets Flapped,\\" a musical number featuring the song \\"The Everlastin' Ingenue Blues\\" written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert Sherwood accompanied by \\"chorus girls\\" including Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Ruth Gillmore, Lenore Ulric, and Mary Brandon; \\"Zowie, or the Curse of an Akins Heart\\"; \\"The Greasy Hag, an O'Neill Play in One Act\\" with Kaufman, Connelly and Woollcott; and \\"Mr. Whim Passes By - An A. A. Milne Play.\\"Altman, p. 203 *F.P.A. often included parodies in his column. His satire of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"Annabel Lee\\" was later collected in his book Something Else Again (1910): :Soul Bride Oddly Dead in Queer Death Pact :High-Born Kinsman Abducts Girl from Poet-Lover‚ÄîFlu Said to Be Cause of Death‚ÄîGrand Jury to Probe :Annabel L. Poe of 1834¬Ω 3rd Ave., the beautiful young fiancee of Edmund Allyn Poe, a magazine writer from the South, was found dead early this morning on the beach off E. 8th Street. Poe seemed prostrated and, questioned by the police, said that one of her aristocratic relatives had taken her to the \\"seashore,\\" but that the cold winds had given her \\"flu,\\" from which she never \\"rallied.\\" Detectives at work on the case believe, they say, that there was a suicide compact between the Poes and that Poe also intended to do away with himself. He refused to leave the spot where the woman's body had been found. Radio As a panelist on radio's Information Please (1938‚Äì48), Franklin P. Adams was the designated expert on poetry, old barroom songs and Gilbert and Sullivan, which he always referred to as Sullivan and Gilbert. A running joke on the show was that his stock answer for quotes that he didn't know was that Shakespeare was the author. (Perhaps that was a running gag: Information Please's creator/producer Dan Golenpaul auditioned Adams for the job with a series of sample questions, starting with: \\"Who was the Merchant of Venice?\\" Adams: \\"Antonio.\\" Golenpaul: \\"Most people would say 'Shylock.'\\" Adams: \\"Not in my circle.\\")Ashley, p. 211. John Kieran was the real Shakespearean expert and could quote from his works at length. A translator of Horace and other classical authors, F.P.A. also collaborated with O. Henry on Lo, a musical comedy.

He started his military career under king John I of Poland. He took part in successful campaigns against the Tatars and Grand Duchy of Moscow. For his victory near Ochakiv against the forces of Mehmet Girey he was awarded with the title of Grand Hetman of Lithuania. He was the first person to receive this title. However, during a war with Muscovy he was defeated in the Battle of Vedrosha (1500) and held captive for three years. In 1503 he managed to escape and joined king Sigismund I the Old, who allowed him to resume his post as a Hetman. As one of the main military leaders (alongside Grand Hetmans of the Crown Miko≈Çaj Firlej and Miko≈Çaj Kamieniecki) of the alliance he continued to wage war against the Grand Duchy of Moscow and in 1512 achieved a great victory against the Tatars in the Battle of Wi≈õniowiec. In 1514 another war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow started and Ostrogski became the commander in chief of all the Polish and Lithuanian forces (amounting to up to 35,000 soldiers). Among his subordinates were Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Janusz ≈öwierczowski, Witold Sampoli≈Ñski and the future Hetman of the Crown Jan Tarnowski. On 8 September 1514 he achieved a significant victory in the Battle of Orsha, defeating an army of Vasili III. However, in 1517 his attempt to besiege the Russian fortress of Opochka became a serious defeat that destroyed any hopes to reconquer Smolensk. He had two wives: Tatiana Koretska and Aleksandra S≈Çucka. He had two sons: Ilia Ostrogski with Koretska, and Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski with S≈Çucka. He died in 1530 as a well-respected military commander. Despite his steady loyalty to the Catholic monarch as well as an old feud with an Orthodox Muscovy, Ostrogski himself remained a devout Orthodox in traditions of his family. He gave generously for construction of Orthodox churches and sponsored the creation of many church- affiliated schools for the orthodox children. As one of the wealthiest Orthodox nobles he was buried in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra in Kiev. He is one of the characters on the famous painting by Jan Matejko, Prussian Homage. The town of Starokostiantyniv still bears his name. The Lithuanian-Polish- Ukrainian Brigade is also named after him.

Kevin Kelly (born 1952) is the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, and a former editor/publisher of the Whole Earth Review. He has also been a writer, photographer, conservationist, and student of Asian and digital culture. Life Kelly was born in Pennsylvania in 1952, and graduated from Westfield High School, Westfield, New Jersey, in 1970. Through his father, an executive for Time who used systems analysis in his work, Kelly developed an early interest in cybernetics. He attended the University of Rhode Island for one year, studying geology. Kelly has traveled extensively, backpacking in Asia. While travelling in the Middle East, he had a conversion experience and became a born-again Christian. He was raised Catholic. Kelly lives in Pacifica, California, a small coastal town just south of San Francisco. He is married to the biochemist Gia-Miin Fuh and has three children: Kaileen, Ting, and Tywen. He regrets not having a fourth child. Among Kelly's personal involvements is a campaign to make a full inventory of all living species on earth, an effort also known as the Linnaean enterprise. He is also sequencing his genome and co-organizes the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup Group. Career Kelly began contributing freelance articles to CoEvolution Quarterly in 1980, while living in Athens, Georgia. Around this time he was also editing his own start-up magazine called Walking Journal, and working in an epidemiology laboratory to support himself. He was hired in 1983 by Whole Earth founder Stewart Brand to edit some of the later editions of the Whole Earth Catalog, the Whole Earth Review, and Signal. With Brand, Kelly helped found the WELL, an influential virtual community. As director of the Point Foundation, he co-sponsored the first Hackers Conference in 1984. In 1992, Kelly was hired by Louis Rossetto to serve as executive editor of Wired. Kelly brought to the magazine the cybernetic social vision of the Whole Earth publications and their networked style of editorial work, while also recruiting writers and editors from the WELL. Kelly stepped down as executive editor in 1999; his current job title at Wired is Senior Maverick. Partially due to his reputation as Wired's editor, he is noted as a participant in and an observer of cyberculture. Kelly's writing has appeared in many other national and international publications such as The New York Times, The Economist, Time, Harper's Magazine, Science, Veneer Magazine, GQ, and Esquire. His photographs have appeared in Life and other American national magazines. Kelly's book-length publication, Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World (1992), presents a view on the mechanisms of complex organization. The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components.

Basic Books) Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World () is a 1992 book by Kevin Kelly. Major themes in Out of Control are cybernetics, emergence, self-organization, complex systems, negentropy and chaos theory and it can be seen as a work of techno-utopianism. Summary The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organizations, intelligent computers as well as to the human brain. Reception The book was not widely reviewed when first released in 1992, but got visibly reviewed and extensively cited during the next several years. Reviews often discussed Kelly's hive-mind analogy as a metaphor for the New Economy. Reviewers have called this book a \\"mind-expanding exploration\\" (Publishers Weekly) and \\"the best of an important new genre\\" (Forbes ASAP). Critics of the book have contended that its position leaves us without a critical approach to politics and social power.

Biography =Birth in exile and return to Algeria= Ahlem was born in Tunis. She is the daughter of a militant political activist who was forced into exile during the Algerian liberation war. In the wake of independence, her family moved back to Algeria, where her father, an intellectual and a humanitarian, occupied high positions in the first Algerian government. He launched a literacy campaign all over the territory and supervised the distribution of agricultural land to the poorest. =Early poetry= In the 70s, following the assassination attempt during the Boumediene coup d‚Äô√©tat, and the consequent hospitalization of her father, who was also targeted, Ahlem, as the eldest sibling, took up the responsibility of providing for her family as a radio host. At the age of 17, she became a household name in Algeria with the poetic daily show Hammassat (Whispers) on national radio. While publishing in 1973, Ala Marfa al Ayam (To the Days‚Äô Haven), Ahlem also became the first woman to publish a compilation of poetry in Arabic, which put her on a thorny and untraveled path. It was followed in 1976 by the release of Al Kitaba fi Lahdat Ouray (The Writing in a Moment of Nudity). At the time, she was part of the first generation to acquire the right to study in Arabic after more than a century of prohibition by the French colonization. =The minefield of the Arabic language= The Arabic language, encouraged by her French-speaking father as if in revenge, provided her with a sense of liberation since her family had not mastered the newly reacquired Arabic language. But, at the time, the Algerian society was rebuilding its identity and recovering from a colonial past that resulted in the death of over a million and a half. It was not prepared to see a girl express herself freely on subjects such as love and women's rights. It was even less prepared to see her do it in the sacred Arabic language. This is where Ahlem's battle begins against sexism. Although women had fought alongside men during the revolution, in the postwar period they were generally relegated to their traditional roles;Salhi, Zahia Smail (2011). \\"Algerian Women as Agents of Change.\\" In: Fatima Sadiqi and Moha Ennaji (Eds.), Women in the Middle East and North Africa: Agents of Change (pp. 149-172). New York: Routledge. p. 155. they were denied the freedom to express themselves and to aspire to success. After she received her B.A in Literature, the board of directors of the University of Algiers refused her enrolment for a Masters under the pretence that her freedom of expression had a negative impact on students. She was also expelled from the Union of Algerian Writers for not conforming to the political line of her time. =Marriage and life in Paris= In Algiers, Mosteghanemi met Georges El Rassi, a Lebanese journalist and historian with a deep knowledge of Algeria, who was preparing a thesis about ‚ÄúArabization and cultural conflicts in independent Algeria‚Äù. They were married in 1976 in Paris and settled there. Ahlam pursued her university studies at the Sorbonne, where in 1982 she obtained a doctorate in Sociology. Her thesis explored the misunderstanding and malaise between both sexes in the Algerian society. The doctorate was under the guidance of Jacques Berques, an eminent orientalist, who also wrote the preface of her thesis (published in 1985 by L‚ÄôHarmattan as Alg√©rie, femmes et √©criture). During the fifteen years she spent in Paris, Ahlam contributed to various magazines, and during time stolen from her new role as a mother of three young boys, wrote fragments of what turned out after four years to be a novel. Ahlam justified her transition from poetry to prose by saying: ¬´When we lose a love, one writes a poem, when we lose our homeland, one writes a novel¬ª. Algeria is never far from her mind: ¬´There are countries that we live in and countries that live in us¬ª. =Settling in Lebanon and revelation= Mosteghanemi in 2000 Once she settles down in 1993 in Lebanon, she presents her novel ‚ÄúZakirat el Jassad‚Äù (Memory of the Flesh), to the editor of the renowned publishing house Dar Al Adab. Excited, the editor will declare: ¬´ this is a bomb¬ª. It will be the revelation. This novel, written in a style highly poetic and with political bravado, will have a phenomenal success throughout the Arab world. The love story is set between an armless painter and the daughter of his former commander encountered in Paris 25 years after the war. The novel evokes the disappointment of the post-war generation, which echoes the disappointment of a generation of Arabs. In a famous letter to the author, Nizar Kabbani, the great contemporary Arab poet, declared: ¬´ This novel gave me vertigo; had I been asked, I would have signed it¬ª. The director Youssef Chahine, winner of the Palme d'Or, purchases the rights to the film shortly before his death. Meanwhile, the famous Hollywood director Mustafa Akkad said that one of his dreams was to adapt ‚ÄúZakirat el Jassad‚Äù into a movie. Moved by his reading, President Ben Bella will say from his exile: ¬´Ahlem is an Algerian sun that illuminates the Arab world¬ª. To date, more than one million copies have been sold across the Arabic-speaking world (excluding pirated editions which vastly outnumber the legal editions in the Arab world). This novel also has the merit to reconcile the Arab reader with the Arabic language and reading. =The trilogy= Ahlem continues her literary success by giving two sequels to her novel: ‚ÄúFawda el Hawas‚Äù (The Chaos of Senses) in 1997 and ‚ÄúAber Sareer‚Äù (Bed Hopper) in 2003. Each part of the trilogy, now a classic, is a bestseller in its own right throughout the Arab world. In 1998, Ahlem receives the Naguib Mahfouz literary prize for ‚ÄúMemory of the Flesh\\". This prize was founded by the American University of Cairo, which will translate the novel in English and publish it in 2000. The jury will say about the author: ¬´Ahlem is a light which shines in thick darkness. She was able to get out of the linguistic exile in which French colonialism had relegated the Algerian intellectuals¬ª. In 2010, \\"Nessyan.com\\" (The Art of Forgetting) is published. It is a break up manual for women, which will bring Ahlem closer to a female audience (Nessyan.com's humorous reference on the cover is that it is banned from sale to men). In 2012, Ahlem's latest novel, El Aswad Yalikou Biki (Black Suits You so Well) is published. The novel confirms Ahlem's status as a major Arab novelist. The story evokes the struggle of a young Algerian teacher whose father, a singer, is killed in the nineties by the terrorists who stand against any form of art and joy in society. Singing at her father's funeral, the girl, previously forbidden to speak to, carries away the crowd with her dreamy voice. Defying terrorism, she embarks in a singing career. She then has to flee her country and during her exile she meets a wealthy and mysterious man who tries to seduce her. The novel addresses the challenge of standing up not only to terrorism but also to the crushing power of money and the media. The launch of the novel will turn out to be a huge literary and media frenzy event (the writer will join on this occasion the group Hachette, which acquires the rights to publish her entire work in Arabic). =Fights and influence= For over 35 years, Ahlem's contribution enriched the Arabic literary scene with her highly acclaimed sentimental and poetic work. Furthermore, through her writings she led the fight against corruption, injustice, totalitarian regimes, fundamentalism, new forms of colonization and the denigration of women's right. With deep admiration for an Algerian poet, Ahlam Mosteghanemi established the Malek Haddad Literary Prize in 2001 for the best Algerian writer. While interviewed in June 2001 she voiced her worries about the lack of Arabic literature in Algeria and was in hopes that the Malek Haddad Literary Prize would encourage more to write in Arabic. Just like Ahlam, Malek Haddad was also from Constantine, Algeria. Although he gave up writing, his reasoning was due to him not being allowed to write in Arabic. Ahlam Mosteghanemi quoted Hadda throughout \\"Memory in Flesh\\" and loved what he stood for. Her quotes, on love as well as politics, are widely used by the Arab public. As of January 2016, the author is followed by more than 9 million fans on Facebook and 700,000 on Twitter.

It is equivalent to a staff sergeant or colour sergeant in the British Army, a colour sergeant in the Royal Marines, and a chief petty officer in the Royal Navy, and has a NATO rank code of OR-7. In the RAF, flight sergeant ranks above chief technician and below warrant officer. History The rank was introduced into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1912 and passed to the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918. RFC flight sergeants wore a four-bladed propeller between the chevrons and the crown. On 1 July 1946, aircrew flight sergeants were redesignated aircrew I and replaced their chevrons with three six-pointed stars within a wreath and surmounted by an eagle and a crown. This proved unpopular however, and in 1950 they reverted to their old rank and badge, although flight sergeants aircrew wear an eagle between chevrons and crown. Between 1950 and 1964, the rank of chief technician was equivalent to flight sergeant and was held instead of that rank by technicians, but now chief technician is a junior rank (still held only by technicians), although classified by NATO in the same grade.

It was also used in the former Royal Rhodesian Air Force. In Canada, since the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, this rank has been replaced by warrant officer. It is also used in the Irish Air Corps, where it is equivalent to the Irish Army rank of company sergeant. The flight sergeant rank in the Indian Air Force was replaced with the rank of junior warrant officer (JWO), which ranks below a warrant officer and above a sergeant. In the RAF, the rank insignia is three downward pointing chevrons below a crown. Flight sergeants are usually addressed as \\"flight\\" and never by the more junior rank of \\"sergeant\\". Flight sergeant is also used in many cadet organisations around the world, such as the Air Training Corps, Combined Cadet Force (RAF Section), Australian Air Force Cadets, and Royal Canadian Air Cadets.

McGovney (born November 2, 1962) is a semi-retired American musician, best known as the original bass guitarist in the heavy metal band Metallica from October 1981 to December 1982. Having previously played with guitarist James Hetfield in the garage band Leather Charm, McGovney was a member of Metallica during its first year of gigging and appeared on their early demos before departing late in 1982. After a period of inactivity, he played in the thrash metal band Phantasm. Musical career =Leather Charm and Metallica= In June 1981, McGovney formed his first band, Leather Charm, with his childhood friend Hetfield and guitarist Hugh Tanner of Hetfield's previous band, Phantom Lord. Tanner soon left Leather Charm to pursue a career in music management; the subsequent lineup featured guitarist Troy James and drummer Jim Mulligan. The group rehearsed a set of new wave of British heavy metal covers and original material for a period of months, but Mulligan's departure later that year led to the band's demise. Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich established their new project, Metallica, in October 1981. With the addition of McGovney and guitarist Dave Mustaine early the next year, the first gigging lineup of the band was completed. After their debut performance on March 14, the band spent 1982 rehearsing in McGovney's parents' long-since- demolished rental property near the 605 freeway and building a local following in the Los Angeles and Orange County heavy metal scenes. They recorded several demos during this time, including one recorded in McGovney's garage, the Power Metal demo, and the live No Life 'Til Leather. A recording of the song \\"Hit the Lights\\" with McGovney playing bass was featured on a repressing of the Metal Massacre Vol. 1 album. McGovney's time in Metallica was reportedly tumultuous, as he often clashed with Ulrich and Mustaine. He felt that, aside from using his connections made as an amateur photographer, his role was that of monetary and transportation provider, rather than a respected member of the band. He ultimately quit on December 10 due to growing tensions, and was replaced by Cliff Burton. After leaving Metallica, McGovney became uninterested in playing music and sold most of his equipment. =Phantasm= In 1986, Hirax vocalist Katon W. De Pena persuaded McGovney to return to music. The two formed the thrash metal band Phantasm with guitarist Rodney Nicholson and several other musicians, briefly including Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan. Phantasm released a demo but never recorded a proper album, and disbanded in 1988 due to disagreements between members. In 2001, the thrash label Deep Six Records released the Wreckage CD, packaging a remastered version of the band's demo of the same name with a live set from 1987. =Later activity= McGovney ceased his professional career after the demise of Phantasm, but gave sporadic interviews and appeared at Metallica-related events. Phantasm discussed a possible reunion in 2007, but this ultimately failed to materialize. He performed publicly for the first time in 23 years on December 10, 2011, playing two songs onstage with Metallica, Mustaine, and early studio guitarist Lloyd Grant at The Fillmore as a part of the celebrations surrounding the end of the group's third decade. Two years later, he joined Mustaine's band Megadeth onstage in Charlotte, North Carolina on December 5, 2013, sharing the lead vocal on a cover version of Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\". McGovney has said that, although his time in Metallica came to an acrimonious end, he now gets along with his former bandmates and speculates that, given his disposition and skill-set, he might have been better able to contribute to the band had he served as road manager rather than bass guitarist.

Muller (born 1946) is an American peace advocate. He was born on Long Island, and grew up in Great Neck, New York and attended Hofstra University. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1967, during the Vietnam War. His commission with the Marines began the same day he received his bachelor's degree in business administration from Hofstra University in 1968, and by September of that year he was a combat lieutenant leading a Marine infantry platoon. In April 1969, while leading an assault in Vietnam, a bullet entered his chest and severed his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. After returning from Vietnam, Muller became a staunch advocate for veterans' rights and Peace activist. In 1974 he earned his J.D. degree from the Hofstra University School of Law. In the same year, he appeared in the anti-war documentary film Hearts and Minds, speaking about his life before, during, and after the Vietnam War. He founded Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) in 1978 and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) in 1980. The VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won a 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2004, Muller founded Alliance for Security. He is currently serving as an advisory board member for a group called Operation Truth and for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation. Muller is president of Veterans for America (formerly known as the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation). Veterans for America is uniting the new generation of veterans with those from past wars to address the needs of veterans, service members and their families and their larger concerns about the impact of war. It is an advocacy and humanitarian organization. Veterans for America is committed to advancing policy and elevating public discourse on the causes, conduct and consequences of war. Muller is a friend of Bill Wieman, Mark Clevinger, and Ron Kovic. He has lectured about his experiences on over 100 college campuses.  Appearances In a 1997 MSNBC NewsChat segment Muller debated Ann Coulter. Muller attempted to explain to Ann that \\"In 90 percent of cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up‚ÄîAnn, are you listening?‚Äîthey were our own mines.\\" She interrupted Muller's point about the role that landmines played in the Vietnam War with the statement \\"No wonder you guys lost.\\" Muller responded to Coulter's remark with an incredulous \\"Say that again,\\" while moderator Felicia Taylor sharply rebuked the in-house pundit: \\"OK, we're not going to get into that conversation.

Ecology The River Clun is an ideal habitat for otters, salmon, white- clawed crayfish, bullhead, grayling and brook lamprey. However, the river is noted as a habitat for the freshwater pearl mussel. The Clun and one of its tributaries, the Unk, have suffered pollution and sediment build up, undermining the mussel's habitat. The catchment area of the river is mostly rural and produces beef, lamb, potatoes and maize. The Clun is one of only eleven watercourses in England that is home to the mussel and one of three English rivers that has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation.

It serves the Red Line. It is located at Davis Square, at the intersection of Holland Street, Elm Street, and College Avenue. By consequence of geography and system layout, Davis is one of only two rapid transit stations in Somerville, the other being Assembly on the Orange Line. It is bordered on both sides by stations that lie in Cambridge: Alewife and Porter. Opened in 1984, Davis station takes its name from Davis Square, which was named after Person Davis (1819-1894), a grain dealer who moved to the area in 1850 and built his estate near the intersection of Elm, Grove and Morrison Streets. The station is fully handicapped accessible. Facilities include a bus terminal for local routes, with a dedicated busway, two head houses and bicycle parking. Davis also includes connections to the Somerville Community Path and the Cambridge Linear Park. History Davis station under construction in 1983 Streetcars propelled the growth of West Somerville after 1858, and regular passenger rail was not far behind. Beginning in 1870, passenger service on the Lexington and Arlington branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad (later succeeded by the Boston and Maine Railroad) came through Davis Square, with a \\"West Somerville\\" stop in the square. A station was built in 1888.\\"Rails of the Past\\" (2008), p. 6 Accessed December 15, 2013 The streetcar and railroad service stimulated substantial development in the 1870s and 1880s as Davis Square quickly grew into an active commercial center. A boom in residential construction followed in the 1890s. In 1927, passenger rail service was re-routed. The abandoned station was damaged by fire during a riot on July 4, 1938. In the 1960s or 1970s, local officials and citizen groups successfully petitioned the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to create a Red Line subway stop in Somerville at Davis Square. Davis opened to passengers for the first time on December 8, 1984, spurring major development and revitalization of the area. Davis and Porter were the first MBTA stations made accessible during initial construction, rather than by renovation. In June 1993, Margaret McCarthy, a blind woman, fell off the platform and was killed by electrocution by the third rail. McCarthy was an advocate for adding tactile warning strips to the edges of station platforms; her death prompted the MBTA to finally install warning strips at all subway stations. The MBTA plans to add two additional surface elevators and two additional platform elevators, and to add new walkways on the mezzanine level to connect the elevators. A design contract was awarded in April 2020. Arts on the Line As a part of the Red Line Northwest Extension, Davis was included as one of the stations involved in the Arts on the Line program. Arts on the Line was devised to bring art into the MBTA's subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.Red Line Northwest Extension Pamphlet page 5.

Cyprian (–ö–ò–ü–†–Ü–Ø–ù). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. 2007 He is best known as Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus' with the Metropolitan see in Moscow. He is commemorated by the Russian Orthodox Church on May 27 and September 16 (by the Old style). Life Cyprian was a clergyman with Bulgarian antecedents (or possible Bulgarian descent).Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, A History of East Central Europe, University of Washington Press, 2013, , p. 438.Graham Speake, A History of the Athonite Commonwealth: The Spiritual and Cultural Diaspora of Mount Athos, Cambridge University Press, 2018, , p. 132.John Meyendorff, Byzantium and the Rise of Russia: A Study of Byzantino-Russian Relations in the Fourteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 2010, , p. 129. He is supposed to have been born in aristocratic family of Tsamblak from Great Tarnovo. After his upbringing, education, and worldview, he was a hesychast (see Hesychasm). As a young man Cyprian had studied at Kilifarevo, just south of Tarnovo, where he possible accepted his monastic vows and where a disciple of Gregory of Sinai named Theodosius of Tarnovo had founded a Hesychast monastery. In Kilifarevo monastery Cyprian met with future Bulgarian patriarch Euthymius who also was studying hesychasm. In 1363 along with Euthymius, Theodosius, and two of Theodosius's followers, Cyprian arrived in Constantinople where he was introduced to Patriarch Callistus I and for a few months studied at the Monastery of Stoudios. Following the death of Theodosius (27 November 1363), Cyprian continued his studies at Mount Athos, becoming a Hesychast.\\"Repose of St Cyprian the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia\\", Orthodox Church in America On the other hand, according to Dimitri Obolensky, Cyprian only became a monk in the early 1370s in Constantinople. At Mount Athos Cyprian befriended Philotheus Kokkinos. In the beginning of the 1370s, after the return of Philotheus to the patriarchal throne, Cyprian became \\"his closest monk\\". In 1373, following three unsuccessful raids of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas against Muscovy as part of the Lithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite War and the schism of Metropolitan of Kiev on Muscovite and Litvin parts (the schism started in 1316 and has taken particularly threatening forms in the beginning of 1350s). Cyprian was sent by the Patriarch as \\"trustee\\" (envoy) to the Lithuanian and Muscovite Russias with the goal to reconcile Litvin and Tverite princes with de-facto Muscovite Metropolitan Alexius and prevent total division of the Church politically between Wilno and Moscow. Perhaps, in winter of the same year Cyprian visited Kiev for the first time along with other cities of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 9 March 1374 he visited Tver on consecration of the bishop of Tver Euthymius and later along with Metropolitan Alexius left for Pereslavl-Zalessky. To Constantinople Cyprian returned from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania carrying with him a letter from Orthodox Christian Lithuanian-Ruthenian (Russian) with a request to the patriarch to consecrate him as the Metropolitan of Lithuania. Following renewed hostilities between Moscow and Lithuania in August of 1375 after capturing of Tver by the Muscovite troops, facing with a potential threat of Catholization of Eastern Orthodox population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and prevent total division of the Ruthenian (Russian) metropolitan diocese, Philotheus I agreed to satisfy the previous petitions of Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas to create a separate metropolitan diocese in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as well as the last petitions of his Eastern Orthodox princes to have Cyprian as their metropolitan. On 2 December 1375 at the Constantinople Council Philotheus I consecrated Cyprian as \\"Metropolitan of Kiev, Russia and Lithuania\\", but under a condition that ‚Äúupon the death of Alexis, Cyprian should become the Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus‚Äù. On 6 June 1376 Cyprian arrived to Kiev as his residence and immediately attempted to get recognition of his rights onto whole metropolitan diocese from the Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitri Donskoi, Novgorod, and Pskov, but futile (all those territories were governed by the Golden Horde through the Khan's jarlig). In 1378, Metropolitan Alexius died. As a result of the ensuing skirmishes and intrigues, Cyprian became Metropolitan of Moscow in 1381. At Moscow, Cyprian endured many sorrows from the Great Prince, so at first he lived either in Lithuania or at Constantinople. In 1379, however, he fled from Moscow due to the approaching armies of Tokhtamysh. Subsequently, he was removed from Russia and replaced with Metropolitan Pimen (1382‚Äì1384). The latter was succeeded by Metropolitan Dionysius (1384‚Äì1385). In 1390, Cyprian was returned to Moscow by Vasili II, who he had always supported, and appointed Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia. He held this title from 1390 till 1406. During his term his main objectives as Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia were to preserve a unified metropolitanate with Moscow and secure pith with Lithuania.John Meyendorff, Byzantium and the Rise of Russia (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary, 1989), 214-221. Achievements Cyprian is remembered as a wise and experienced church administrator who fought for the unity of the Russian church. In fact, he is mainly responsible for uniting the Church in Russia and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He faced serious opposition during his metropolitanate; Dmitry Donskoy and his advisors were excommunicated for opposing Cyprian's efforts to take up his place in Moscow, and Novgorod the Great ‚Äì especially Archbishops Aleksei and Ioann II ‚Äì also opposed his efforts to adjudicate ecclesiastical cases there, which would have allowed him to gain the court fees from Novgorod during the time he sat in judgement there. Cyprian was an erudite person and oversaw the copying and creation of a number of important works, including the Troitskaia Chronicle (or Troitskaya letopis') and, probably, the Metropolitan Justice (also known as the Pravosudiye metropolich‚Äôye or –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å—É–¥–∏–µ –º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—á—å–µ). He also rewrote the Life of Metropolitan Peter, originally written around 1327. He also corrected biblical books and translated a number of ecclesiastic works from Greek into Old Church Slavic.Droblenkova and Prokhorov, ‚ÄúKiprian (ok. 1330-16.IX.1406) Mitropolit Kievskii i vseia Rusi,‚Äù in D.

The Book of Degrees (Step√©nnaya kniga), which grouped Russian monarchs in the order of their generations, was started by Cyprian in 1390 (but completed only in 1563). Death He died on September 16th, 1406.http://www.orthodox.net/menaion- september/15-st-cyprian-metropolitan-of-kiev.html Cyprian is buried in the Assumption Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin.

Clun Castle was established by the Norman lord Robert de Say after the Norman invasion of England and went on to become an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th century, with an extensive castle-guard system. Owned for many years by the Fitzalan family, Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack until it was gradually abandoned as a property in favour of the more luxurious Arundel Castle. The Fitzalans converted Clun Castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th century, complete with pleasure gardens, but by the 16th century the castle was largely ruined. Slighted in 1646 after the English Civil War, Clun remained in poor condition until renovation work in the 1890s. Today the castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument. It is owned by the Duke of Norfolk, who also holds the title of Baron Clun, and is managed by English Heritage. Architecture The ruined great keep of Clun Castle, designed for the Fitz Alan family's residential use. Clun Castle is located on a bend in the River Clun, overlooking the small town of Clun and its church (on the other side of the river).Brown, p. 92. The river provides natural defences from the north and west, whilst the main keep of the castle stands upon a large motte or mound. Most historians conclude that this is primarily a natural elevation of rock, which has then been cut and scarped into its current, although others argue that it is mostly artificial.Pettifer, p. 211; Mackenzie, p. 113; Brown, p. 92. Three similar, but less dramatic mounds around the main motte provide the basic structure for the castle defences.Mackenzie, p.131. The remains of the tall, four-storey rectangular great keep are still standing on the north side of the motte. In large part this a typical late Norman keep, wide, similar to those locally at Alberbury, Bridgnorth and Hopton, featuring pilaster buttresses and round- headed Norman windows.Pettifer, p. 208; Mackenzie, p. 133; Pettifer, p. 211. Unusually the keep is off-centre, probably to allow the foundations greater reach and avoid placing excessive pressure on the motte ‚Äì a similar design can be found at Guildford Castle.Pettifer, p. 211; Brown, p. 92. The ground floor was used for storage, with the upper three storeys for the family's residential use.Emery, p. 586. Each floor had its own large fireplace and five windows.Brown, p. 92; Mackenzie, p. 133. The great keep appears powerful, but was built as a compromise between security and comfort ‚Äì the building has relatively few arrowslits ‚Äì many of the externally visible arrowslits are fakes and the building as a whole could easily have been undermined. On the highest point of the main motte are the remains of one wall of what appears to have been an earlier small square keep, probably dating from the 11th or 12th centuries. The remains of a bridge, linking the main motte with the south-west mound, can just be seen to the south of this; this bridge would have formed the main route to the town.Mackenzie, p. 133. South of the bridge is the site of the gatehouse, while the foundations of a great round tower can be seen to the south-west. Along the west front are the remains of two solid turrets, built in possible imitation of Ch√¢teau Gaillard. A number of domestic buildings once stood inside the main bailey, including a grange, a stable and a bakehouse.Acton, p. 12. The earthworks of two further bailey walls can be seen on the east side of the castle. The surrounding grounds around Clun Castle have been extensively developed in the past and a pleasure garden can still be made out in the field beyond the River Clun to the west.Johnson, p. 35. To the north-east lies the remains of a fish pond, with a sluice connecting this to the river. History =11th‚Äì12th centuries= river Clun toward Wales Before the Norman invasion, the manor of Clun was owned by Eadric the Wild. The area around Clun was rugged, thinly populated and covered in extensive forests in early medieval times.Emery, p. 472; Lieberman, p.167. Clun Castle was originally established by Robert de Say, also known as Picot, an early Norman baron who seized the territory from Edric; Robert built a substantial motte castle with two baileys. Robert held the castle and district from the Earl of Shrewsbury until 1102. After the Shrewsbury rebellion of that year, Robert and his descendants held their castle directly from the Crown. Picot's daughter married the local Welsh lord, Cadwgan ap Bleddyn. In 1109 Cadwgan was forced out of Powys and it is possible that he lived at Clun Castle during this time. The couple had a son, Henry de Say, who inherited the castle in 1098, with his son, Helias de Say controlling the castle until his death in 1165. Under Helias, the barony of Say was divided in two, with Helias' daughter Isabella de Say receiving an expanded estate centred on Clun, and the more easterly elements of the de Say land, including the future Stokesay Castle, being given to Theodoric de Say. At around the same time, Henry I established a new castle-guard system at Clun, probably in response to the succession of Welsh attacks in the decades following the rebellion of Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1094.Suppe 2003, p. 217, pp. 219‚Äì220. Under the castle- guard system, protecting Clun Castle was undertaken by knights from a group of fiefs stretching eastwards away from Clun and the Welsh frontier, linked in many cases by the old Roman road running alongside the river Clun.Suppe 2003, p. 213. Each knight had to conduct forty days of military service each year, probably being called up in a crisis rather than maintaining a constant guard, and were supplemented when required by additional mounted or infantry sergeants.Suppe 2003, pp. 219, 220. Henry II continued the royal focus on Clun as the regional centre for protecting the border, investing heavily in the castle during 1160‚Äì64.Lieberman, p. 167. The castle could also draw on Welsh feudal service, with twenty-five local Welsh settlements owing the castle military duty.Suppe, 2001, p. 210. The area surrounding the castle was now declared a Marcher Barony, known in the 13th century as the Honour of Clun, which meant it was governed by its own, rather than English law, and the Marcher Lord who controlled this section of the Welsh Marches.Acton, p. 13; Eyton 1860, p. 228. In particular, the lord of Clun Castle was known for having the right to execute criminals on his own behalf, rather than as the representative of the king; criminals would be taken from as far as Shrewsbury for this punishment to be carried out.Acton, p. 13. Isabella married William Fitz Alan, the lord of Oswestry. William was another powerful regional lord, and was appointed the High Sheriff of Shropshire by Adeliza of Louvain, the second wife of Henry I.Owen and Blakeway, p. 77. After Henry I's death during the Anarchy, in which England was split between the rival claimants of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, William declared for the Empress Maud and in 1138 held Shrewsbury Castle for four weeks against Stephen.Owen and Blakeway, p. 78. William escaped before the fall of the city, spending the next fifteen years in exile before the return of Henry II in 1153.Owen and Blakeway, p. 79. Isabella married twice more after William's death, with her husbands Geoffrey de Vere and William Botorel being lords of Clun Castle by virtue of marriage, but on her death in 1199 the castle passed to her son from her first marriage, the second William Fitz Alan.Brown, p. 93; Suppe, 2001, p. 210. In doing so, Isabella created the combined lordship of neighbouring Oswestry and Clun, the beginnings of what would become a powerful noble family. William built the tall, off-centre Norman keep that dominates the site today, blending a defensive fortification with the beginnings of a more luxurious style of living. William had been with King Richard I during the building of Ch√¢teau Gaillard in Normandy and it would seem that the distinctive circular towers William built to defend the new keep at Clun were based on those at Gaillard. The result was echoed in Shropshire, on a smaller scale, in the fortified tower-houses at Upper Millichope and Wattlesborough, whilst several generations later the trend would result in Stokesay Castle.Emery, p. 576. =13th century= mid-Victorian depiction of the ruined Clun Castle In the 13th century, Shropshire was in the front line of attempts by Prince Llywelyn the Great to reassert the power of the Welsh principality, aided by the difficult relations that King John enjoyed with the local barons.Pettifer, p. 208. For many years there was an erroneous story that in 1196 the castle was besieged by the Welsh under Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, a Prince of the Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth.Pettifer, p. 211 believe this however. This story is a confusion of Colwyn Castle in Radnorshire, which was attacked in 1196, and the Welsh rendition of Clun, Colunwy. William died in 1210, leaving the castle to his eldest son, another William Fitz Alan. King John, however, demanded a huge fee of 10,000 marks for William to inherit his lands; unable to pay, Clun Castle was assigned to Thomas de Eardington instead.Mackenzie, p. 147. William died shortly afterwards at Easter, 1215, and his brother, John Fitz Alan, a close friend of Llywelyn the Great, promptly took up arms against the king, immediately seizing Clun and Oswestry from royal control. In 1216, King John responded militarily, his forces attacking and burning Oswestry town, before besieging and taking Clun Castle in a surprise attack.Eyton 1862, p. 45. John came to an understanding with King John's successor, Henry III in 1217 after finally paying a fine of 10,000 marks.Burke, p. 197. In 1233‚Äì34 during the conflict between King Henry III, the Earl Marshal, and Llywelyn the Great, suspicions were raised again over the loyalty of John Fitzalan, and Clun Castle was garrisoned with royal troops in 1233 to ensure its continued reliability as a key fortress. The castle successfully resisted the attack by Llywelyn that year, although Clun itself was destroyed. In 1244 John FitzAlan inherited the castle from his father; John also became the de jure Earl of Arundel. The Welsh border situation was still unsettled, and security grew significantly worse in the next few years, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn up Gruffudd conducted numerous raids into English territories.Emery, p. 474. John's son, another John Fitzalan inherited the castle, marrying Isabella, one of the neighbouring and powerful Mortimer family. In 1272 John died leaving a young son, Richard; during his minority the castle was controlled by Roger Mortimer of Wigmore.Eyton 1862, p. 232. A group of commissioners, called in to examine the castle as part of the inquest, noted that the castle was described as \\"small but strongly built\\", but in some need of repair, with the bridge and the roof of one of the towers needing particular work.Eyton 1862, p. 45; Eyton 1860, p. 232; Pettifer, p. 211, Acton p. 12. =14th‚Äì17th centuries= late- Victorian diagram of Clun Castle The invasion of North Wales by Edward I in the 1280s significantly reduced the threat of Welsh invasion and the long-term requirements for strong military fortifications such as Clun Castle. Meanwhile, the FitzAlan family had acquired Arundel Castle by marriage in 1243; their new castle proved to be a much more amenable location for the Earls of Arundel and became their primary residence. By the 14th century Clun Castle had been transformed into a hunting lodge complete with pleasure gardens by the FitzAlan family, who kept a large horse stud at the castle, along with their collections at Chirk and Holt castles.Emery, 688. Richard II made an attempt to break the power of the Arundel family in the area, removing Clun Castle from the Fitz Alan family with the execution of Richard FitzAlan in 1397, granting it to the Duke of York with the intent that it became part of the Earldom of Chester; with the fall of Richard II and the return to favour of Thomas FitzAlan, the castle was restored to the family.Dunn, p. 62. There was a resurgence of interest in Clun Castle during the Glynd≈µr Rising of 1400‚Äì15, with Thomas playing a key role in suppressing the revolt; the castle was refortified and saw some service against the Welsh rebels led by Owain Glynd≈µr.Fry, p. 80. By the 16th century, the antiquarian John Leland observed the increasingly ruined nature of Clun Castle.Brown, p. 93. Philip Howard, the 20th earl of Arundel, died in 1595 whilst under attainment, and James I gave Clun Castle to Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton.Mackenzie, p. 132. The castle was abandoned by the time of the English Civil War of 1642‚Äì46 and saw no military action; it was slighted by Parliament, however, in 1646 to prevent any possible use as a fortress. The castle passed through several hands in the coming years, including a period in which it was owned by Clive of India. The 19th century author Sir Walter Scott used Clun Castle as the model for the castle \\"Guarde Doleureuse\\" in his medieval novel The Betrothed in 1825. Today In 1894, the site was purchased by the Duke of Norfolk, a descendant of the original FitzAlan family. The Duke undertook a programme of conservation on the castle, stabilising its condition. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument. The site is open to the public, managed by English Heritage.

Premise Grantchester Grind follows on from the story of the fictitious Porterhouse College, Cambridge, started in the previous book, Porterhouse Blue. Plot Porterhouse is a college which had an incident involving a bedder and the college's only research graduate student which caused the Bull Tower to be severely damaged. Since the college's funds were exhausted by a previous bursar with a tendency to gamble, one of the story's central themes is guided by the Senior Members' attempts to acquire funds for the college. The new Master, Skullion, the previous Head Porter of the college, is frail after a stroke (or a 'Porterhouse Blue' , hence the previous book's title) and the issues surrounding the death of the previous Master, Sir Godber Evans, prompt his widow to instigate a plan to investigate the death through a planted Fellow, backed by a large, anonymous donation to the College. Meanwhile, the Dean of the College takes it upon himself to visit prosperous Old Porterthusians (previous members of Porterhouse) in the hope that one is willing and able to become Master if and when Skullion cannot continue. At the same time, the current Bursar is contacted by an American media mogul who seems to be interested in supporting the college without clarifying what it is he wants in return. At the end of the novel the alcoholic Lord Jeremy Pimpole is appointed as Master of the College. Incidents from Ancestral Vices, another Tom Sharpe novel, are mentioned in crossover.

She was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Greg Selinger. Allan was raised in MacGregor, Manitoba, and was educated at MacGregor Collegiate. From 1990 to 1994, she was director of development for the Canadian Diabetes Association. She worked for the Manitoba Motion Picture Industries Association from 1994 to 1995, and then as a consultant for small business and non-profit organizations from 1995 to 1999. She has also taught two continuing education courses at the University of Winnipeg. Allan began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Norwood School Division from 1995 to 1998 and the St. Boniface School Division from 1998 to 1999. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Shirley Render in the south-central Winnipeg riding of St. Vital by 5218 votes to 3699. In 2003 she supported Bill Blaikie's bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party. In the 2003 election Allan was re-elected with over 63% of the popular vote. On November 4, 2003, she entered cabinet as Minister of Labour of Immigration, with responsibility for Multiculturalism, Status of Women and administration of the Workers Compensation Act. Allan was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. After Greg Selinger succeeded Gary Doer as premier of Manitoba, he appointed Allan as the Minister of Education on November 3, 2009. During her term as Education minister, Allan introduced anti-bullying legislation: Bill 18, the public schools amendment act (safe and inclusive schools). Religious organizations criticized the legislation, claiming it infringed on freedom of religion by requiring faith-based schools to support the creation of gay-straight alliances if initiated by students. The federal Public Safety Minister at the time, Vic Toews, stated that he believed that the bill violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The bill passed into law in September 2013. On October 18, 2013, Nancy Allan was removed from the post of education minister by Premier Greg Selinger.

It serves the rapid transit Red Line and has a street-level terminal for the MBTA bus system. It is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue with Western Avenue, Prospect Street, and Magazine Street at Central Square. The station is fully accessible, with each of the two side platforms served by an elevator. History Old tile sign above the platforms Central Square station opened along with Park Street Under, Kendall Square station, and Harvard Square station on March 23, 1912. Several 1912-built tile mosaics displaying the station name are still visible above the platforms. Similar mosaics are visible at a number of other older MBTA stations, including South Station and Broadway on the Red Line. On January 26, 1978, heavy rains flooded the station. In the mid-1980s, the platforms were extended at many early-built Red Line stations, allowing six- car trains to be run beginning in January 1988. The platforms at Central were extended to the northwest (contrary to original plans for the southeast) beginning on April 25, 1985, with new entrances placed west of Prospect Street.

The original park is in Tampa, Florida, and the second park is in Williamsburg, Virginia. There were also previously Busch Gardens parks in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California (1964‚Äì1979) and Houston, Texas (1971‚Äì1973). The \\"Busch Gardens\\" name was earlier used to refer to the gardens developed by Adolphus Busch near his home in Pasadena, California, which were open to the public from 1906 to 1937. The Busch Gardens amusement parks were initially developed as marketing vehicles for Anheuser-Busch and featured hospitality houses with samples of Anheuser- Busch products. They also included stables that housed many of the company's Clydesdale horses, which have been associated with Anheuser-Busch since 1933. Eventually, rides and attractions were added to the parks and over time were developed into full theme parks while still promoting Anheuser-Busch. Busch Entertainment Corporation, now called SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, was created as a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch Companies to run the various parks in 1959. In 2009, InBev, the new owners of Anheuser-Busch, sold the amusement parks to the Blackstone Group. Blackstone has kept some of the popular traditions including a stable with Clydesdales; however, the Clydesdales are not affiliated with the beer company. Locations =Busch Gardens Tampa Bay= SheiKra was the first \\"dive machine\\" roller coaster in the United States. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay opened on March 31, 1959 and has an African theme. The park was originally tagged \\"The Dark Continent.\\" The theme park is one of America's largest zoological institutions, with and more than 2,700 animals. Attractions include: Montu, Kumba, Scorpion, Edge of Africa, Jungala, Sand Serpent, Congo River Rapids, Saga, Tanganyika Tidal Wave, Stanley Falls, Serengeti Railway, Phoenix, Sesame Street and SheiKra, a vertical dive coaster which opened in 2005. In 2011, the park added Cheetah Hunt, a triple launch roller coaster. In 2014, the park added Falcon's Fury, an Intamin drop tower. In 2016, the park constructed Cobra's Curse, a steel roller coaster created by Mack Rides. In 2019, the park opened Tigris, a steel launched roller coaster constructed by Premier Rides. In 2020, the park will open a new hybrid coaster by Rocky Mountain Construction on the site where Gwazi once stood. The park is some distance away from downtown, in central Tampa, near the limits of the city of Temple Terrace to the east of Tampa. =Busch Gardens Williamsburg= Busch Gardens Williamsburg opened May 16, 1975. With its European theme, the park was originally tagged \\"The Old Country.\\" Attractions at this park include Alpengeist, Escape from Pompeii, Apollo's Chariot, Loch Ness Monster and Griffon. Added in 2007, the Griffon coaster had bragging rights as the tallest dive coaster in the United States. The park is divided into seven sections, each themed to a different European country. On July 25, 2009, Busch Gardens announced that the Big Bad Wolf roller coaster would be retired September 7, 2009, after 25 years of operation due to its \\"meeting the end of its service life.\\" and was replaced with Verbolten - a New Multiple Launch Coaster that opened in 2012. Newly added in 2009 was \\"Christmas Town,\\" A Busch Gardens Celebration, with many themed holiday attractions and shows with eight million lights and a 50-foot Light Animated Christmas Tree. Also in 2010, the 3-D ride Corkscrew Hill was replaced by Europe in the Air, which itself was replaced by a new VR action ride called Battle for Eire in 2018. Also new for 2010 was illumiNights: A Busch Garden Encore, with many mini nightly country shows and nightly fireworks set to a special soundtrack which is available during the special event in many gift shops. In 2010, Busch Gardens announced a drop tower called the M√§ch Tower which was set to open in late spring 2011 but was delayed due to train problems from Italy and opened in August 2011. Tempesto opened in May 2015, as it was part of an addition to the park's Italy section. InvadR, the first ever wooden coaster at Busch Gardens, opened in 2017. Former parks =Busch Gardens in California= Long before the current Busch Gardens amusement parks, the name referred to the personal gardens of Adolphus Busch, co-founder of Anheuser-Busch. After becoming wealthy in the beer business, Busch purchased a winter home in Pasadena, California. He landscaped the around his home with thousands of plants, as well as statues, waterfalls and walking paths. He opened these \\"Busch Gardens\\" to the public in 1906. The gardens became a major tourist attraction, even after Busch's death in 1913 and prompted the Pacific Electric Railway to establish a stop for the gardens' visitors. The nearby Hollywood film industry used the gardens in many films, including Frankenstein (1931), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), The Adventures of Robin Hood (archery scene, 1938), and Gone With the Wind (Twelve Oaks barbecue, 1939). Busch's widow offered the gardens to the city of Pasadena on multiple occasions for use as a public park, but the city never accepted the offer. Busch Gardens closed in 1937 and the land was later subdivided. The area is now a residential neighborhood, though some of the landscape features of the Busch Gardens era remain. In 1954, a new brewery was opened in Van Nuys. The company opened one of the modern Busch Gardens parks at this site in 1966 that included boat rides, a monorail and free beer. The amusement park was renamed Busch Bird Sanctuary in 1977 and closed two years later. =Busch Gardens Houston= Houston's Busch Gardens opened in May 1971 and was closed within several years. It was located adjacent to the Anheuser- Busch brewery, which opened in 1966. The park had an Asian theme except for an ice cave with a temperature controlled environment for several varieties of penguins, polar bears and sea lions. It also had its own narrow gauge railway. =Barcelona= Anheuser-Busch and Grand Tibidabo, S.A., owners of Tibidabo Amusement Park, in Barcelona, along with other Spanish investors, made plans to build a Tibi Gardens outside of Barcelona, Spain, in the late 1980s. During construction, several of the Spanish investors backed out, and investors from The Tussauds Group stepped in. The park was renamed Port Aventura and when it opened in 1995 in Salou, Spain, Anheuser Busch had a 20% investment in the park while The Tussauds Group had 40%. In 1998 the majority of Tussauds Group's shares in the park were sold to Universal.. Unbuilt parks =Busch Gardens Dubai= In 2008, Busch Entertainment Corporation announced plans to open a new park in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2012. It was going to be placed on a man-made island shaped like Shamu in Dubai with SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica also being built on that island. The Dubai park would have added on a third park to the Busch Gardens brand. The plans have been shelved because of financial issues. On February 4, 2009, Busch Entertainment announced that the Dubai plans had been canceled due to the global recession. Free beer samples After InBev sold the amusement parks in 2009 to Blackstone, many beer-affiliated traditions ended, including the tradition of offering free beer samples in their Hospitality Centers, and Brewmaster Clubs would come to an end in the parks. Also announced was that workers will not get two cases of beer a month for free, which they would receive under old parent Anheuser-Busch. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay has again begun offering free samples in conjunction with limited-time promotions, most recently in 2019 as part of the park's year-long 60th anniversary celebration. Each guest may sample two seven-ounce servings of beer. See also *Incidents at Busch parks Anheuser-Busch owned several other parks.

He worked for Origin Systems, Electronic Arts, id Software, Wild Tangent, Microsoft's Xbox, Atari, and Exigent. He created artwork or models for several prominent game series including Wing Commander and Quake. He was employed by id Software until he was fired in retaliation for conflict over the creation of Doom 3 (according to John Carmack). Steed began his career with videogames in 1991 at Origin Systems, after answering a newspaper ad that said \\"Fantasy artist wanted\\". Starting as a game design sketcher, he moved up to art director then project director. Steed has indicated he \\"didn't touch a mouse until I was 27.\\" He worked as an art director at Virgin Entertainment and a designer at Iguana entertainment as well. In 2000 after being fired from id Software he went to work for Wild Tangent making several dancing girl visualizers for Winamp and a third-person shooter called Betty Bad (an homage to Steed's favorite arcade game, Tempest). Steed gained press and controversy with the release of a \\"Crackwhore\\" female model for Quake II in response to a skin (character texture) contest for the first Quake sponsored by a group of female gamers who called themselves the \\"Crackwhore Clan\\". The Crackwhore model was released after Quake II was released as a downloadable character as an homage to that same female gamer clan. While Quake II included a female character as an option when playing, both the phraseology and approach to the Crackwhore model received some amount of criticism despite the 'Crackwhore Clan' having been created and organized by and composed solely of female gamers - not Paul Steed. He was active in the game development community and gave talks not only at the annual Game Developer's Conference, but also at universities and art institutes. He initiated and sponsored several modeling contests such as the Bad Girl and Cute Doll contests by which he challenged any and all other modelers to compete against him for sponsored prizes. Paul convinced many vendors like Autodesk to contribute those prizes as well as recognition to the contest winners. A published author, Paul Steed wrote three books on modeling and animating game characters for 3D games. He served on the Advisory Board for GDC for many years and as creative director for Microsoft's Xbox and Atari he gained experience on the other side of the developer fence. He left Atari in 2006 to co-found Exigent with Garland Wong and Jesse Rapczak. As President and Chief Creative Officer at Exigent, a global game art company for next generation and casual games, Paul oversaw more than 100 artists in India and China while consulting with top developers and publishers. Lately he provided creative and managerial leadership for an unannounced UTV Ignition Entertainment project, but subsequently moved on to a series of casual and console projects.

Cultivation and uses Lolium contains some species which are important grasses for lawns, and as pasture and for grazing and hay for livestock, being a highly nutritious stock feed. Ryegrasses are also used in soil erosion control programs. It is the principal grazing grass in New Zealand where some 10 million kilograms of certified seed are produced every year. There is a large range of cultivars. The primary species found worldwide and used for both lawns and as a forage crop is perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Like many cool-season grasses of the Poaceae, it harbors a symbiotic fungal endophyte, either Epichlo√´ or its close relative Neotyphodium, both of which are members of the fungal family Clavicipitaceae. Some species, particularly L. temulentum, are weeds which can have a severe impact on the production of wheat and other crops. Annual ryegrass (L. rigidum) is one of the most serious and costly weeds of cropping systems in southern Australia, and herbicide resistance is a frequent problem.https://grdc.com.au/resources-and- publications/resources/iwmhub/common-weeds-of-cropping/annual-ryegrass. Ryegrass pollen is also one of the major causes of hay fever. Tennis courts, including those at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the venue for Wimbledon, are planted with ryegrass..

There is no equivalent at the vast majority of other British or American universities, though the universities of Princeton, Yale, and Harvard have previously offered similar positions to care for their students' needs. History In early times, bedders were often employed directly by students and fellows rather than the college, but they are now part-time college employees. An edict of the University of Cambridge issued in 1635 banned bedders aged under fifty, although this policy has long since been abandoned. Until the late Victorian age, women were not allowed to become undergraduates, and there were even regulations preventing Fellows from marrying, so the edict may have been intended to leave bedders beyond suspicion of any impropriety. Rumours persist that there was once a broader \\"Bedder Test\\",I'm a bedder, not a servant, The Cambridge Student, 21 February 2008 but there is no evidence that colleges ever preferred women of unappealing mien.

Nowadays, bedders often change bed linen, vacuum the rooms, empty bins and perform other domestic services, although their role varies from college to college. Some do not make beds at all, but others go so far as to take care of their students' washing up.

Delfshaven is a borough of Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the right bank of river Nieuwe Maas. It was a separate municipality until 1886. The town of Delfshaven grew around the port of the city of Delft. Delft itself was not located on a major river, so in 1389 a harbour was created about due south of the city, to be able to receive seafaring vessels and avoid tolls being levied by the neighbouring and competing city of Rotterdam. This settlement was named Delfshaven (\\"Port of Delft\\"). On 1 August 1620 the Pilgrim fathers left Delfshaven with the Speedwell. Since then, the town's Oude Kerk has also been known as the Pelgrimskerk, or in English, the \\"Pilgrim Fathers Church\\". Delfshaven, in Joan Blaeu's collection Tooneel der Steeden, 1649 Fishing, shipbuilding and the distillery of jenever were the main sources of income. The Dutch East India Company had important wharves and warehouses in Delfshaven, and one of the Dutch West India Company's most famous commanders, Piet Hein, was born here. Delfshaven belonged to the city and municipality of Delft until 1811, when it became a separate municipality. Delfshaven was annexed by Rotterdam in 1886 at its own request. The current borough has about 73,000 inhabitants. Its small historic centre has been carefully preserved. It features modest local museums, a brewery and various dining and drinking facilities. Delfshaven escaped the bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe on 14 May 1940. Later during the Second World War, the area around the Visserijplein and other parts of the western city of Rotterdam were destroyed by Allied bombing on 31 March 1943.

It serves the MBTA Red Line, Located at the intersection of Main Street and Broadway, it is named for the primary areas it serves - the Kendall Square business district and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Opened in March 1912 as part of the original Cambridge Subway, Kendall/MIT has two side platforms serving the line's two tracks. The Kendall Band, a public art installation of hand-operated musical sculptures, is located between the tracks in the station with controls located on the platforms. Kendall/MIT station is accessible. With 17,018 weekday boardings by a FY2019 count, Kendall/MIT has the fourth highest ridership among MBTA subway stations. History Kepler, one section of Kendall Band, in 2011 The Cambridge subway opened from Park Street Under to Harvard on March 23, 1912, with intermediate stops at Central and Kendall. From the early 20th century through the 1970s, the MBTA operated a powerhouse above ground in Kendall Square, including rotary converters (also called cycloconverters) to transform incoming AC electrical power to 600 volts DC power fed to the third rail to run the subway. An old-fashioned cycloconverter consisted of an AC motor coupled to a huge, slowly rotating flywheel coupled to a DC generator, hence the name. Despite the development of compact low-maintenance semiconductor- based power rectifiers, the long-obsolete electromechanical technology still occupied prime real estate in the heart of Kendall Square. The MBTA powerhouse was demolished, and replaced with an office building located at the convergence of Broadway and Main Street. =Name changes and reconstruction= The MBTA has renamed the station on several occasions. On August 7, 1978, the station was renamed as Kendall/MIT to indicate the nearby presence of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On December 2, 1982, Columbia station was renamed JFK/UMass, and Kendall/MIT was renamed as Cambridge Center/MIT after the adjacent Cambridge Center development, although most station signs were not changed. There were many complaints that the MBTA had suddenly changed the name without public input, and that the new name would be confused with the next Red Line station at Central Square. On June 26, 1985, the name was reverted to Kendall/MIT as part of a series of station name changes. During the 1980s, the MBTA rebuilt Kendall/MIT and other Red Line stations with longer platforms for six-car trains and with elevators for handicapped accessibility. The rebuilt station was dedicated in October 1987 and six-car trains began operation on January 21, 1988. The south headhouse is proposed for reconstruction as part of the Kendall Square Initiative development project. The new headhouse would have two angled glass entrances and a glass elevator, with an angular canopy supported on thin columns. =Kendall Band= Between 1986 and 1988, artist Paul Matisse installed Kendall Band, an interactive musical sculpture, at Kendall/MIT. Located between the Red Line tracks at the station, it cost $90,000 to construct under the Arts on the Line program. It consists of three musical devices - Pythagoras, Kepler, and Galileo - controlled by levers located on both subway platforms. Although Matisse maintained it for several decades, it ultimately fell into disrepair. A group of MIT students began restoration in 2010, with Pythagoras rendered partially functional in May 2011. =Circumferential service= MIT Brain and Cognitive Science building; this location was also a proposed stop on the Urban Ring service. Kendall/MIT Station was a proposed stop on the Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a circumferential bus rapid transit (BRT) line designed to connect the current radial MBTA rail lines, to reduce overcrowding in the downtown stations, but it was canceled in 2010. Under draft plans released in 2008, new surface-level BRT platforms would have been constructed on Main Street at Kendall/MIT. In 2012, the state studied the feasibility of sending some Framingham/Worcester Line trains to North Station via the Grand Junction Railroad, including the possibility of a new commuter rail station at Kendall. The possible station would have consisted of a single platform between Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and was estimated to cost $7.5 million. After objections from the City of Cambridge over potential traffic problems due to the grade crossings on the Grand Junction, the MBTA declined to pursue implementation of the proposed service. In 2014, it was revealed by the state that the stop would be part of the proposed Indigo Line system with frequent DMU service, but that plan was canceled in 2015 for financial reasons. A 2019 report indicated that daily boardings at the station would double to 30,000 by 2040, increasing the need for relief service on the Grand Junction and other corridors.

To the public he's better known by the name Hector, which he has used since the release of his 1965 debut single \\"Palkkasoturi\\", a Finnish translation of Buffy Sainte- Marie's \\"Universal Soldier\\". His 1974 album Hectorock I became the fastest selling record in Finnish history, selling 50,000 units within a few months. Hector was at the height of his popularity in the first half of the 1970s, but his steady string of recordings provided occasional hits well into the 1990s. In the 2000s, he made strong comeback to popularity with his album Ei selityksi√§. That album became one of his most successful albums. In 2007 he made a farewell tour on big arenas, but has performed occasionally after that too. In 2011 he made a massive comeback tour and released a new album Hauras (Fragile) in 2014, ten years after his previous album. Hector's musical style is very diverse. He is mainly known of his folk rock songs, but he has also made progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal songs. He has translated Don McLean, Procol Harum, King Crimson, Neil Young, David Bowie and several other artists in Finnish. Today he is considered, due to his extremely long (51 years) and distinguished career as one of the both pioneers and mainstays of Suomirock. His lyrics have often a political and/or social component. Some of Hector's songs are considered classics of Finnish popular music, such as \\"Lumi teki enkelin eteiseen\\" (Snow made an angel in the lobby), \\"Mandoliinimies\\" (Mandolin man) and \\"Olen hautausmaa\\" (I am a graveyard), and he can be considered a primary contributor to Finnish rock music of the 1970s. He has also written song lyrics to other Finnish singers. His song \\"Juodaan Viinaa\\" (Let's drink spirits) was covered by Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani on their 2009 album \\"Karkelo.\\"http://www.myspace.com/korpiklaani/music/albums/karkelo-13016028 Hector is the Finnish voice actor of The Muskrat in the Finnish-British animated television family drama Moominvalley (2019‚Äì).

It is the only one to live outside of tropical rainforests in the wild. It is most easily distinguished from other tapirs by its thick woolly coat and white lips. The species name comes from the term \\"La Pinchaque\\", an imaginary beast said to inhabit the same regions as the mountain tapir.Downer, Craig C. \\"Status and Action Plan of the Mountain Tapir (Tapirus pinchaque).\\" Tapirs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan published by the IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group, 1997. Description Mountain tapirs are black or very dark brown, with occasional pale hairs flecked in amongst the darker fur. The fur becomes noticeably paler on the underside, around the anal region, and on the cheeks. A distinct white band runs around the lips, although it may vary in extent, and there are usually also white bands along the upper surface of the ears. In adults, the rump has paired patches of bare skin, which may help to indicate sexual maturity. The eyes are initially blue, but change to a pale brown as the animal ages. Unlike all other species of tapir, the fur is long and woolly, especially on the underside and flanks, reaching or more in some individuals. Adults are usually around in length and in height at the shoulder. They typically weigh between , and while the sexes are of similar size, females tend to be around heavier than the males.Tapirus pinchaque, Animal Diversity WebMountain Tapir , Arkive Like the other types of tapir, they have small, stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot, each with large nails and supported by a padded sole. A patch of bare skin, pale pink or grey in colour, extends just above each toe. Mountain tapir skull on display at the Museum of Osteology Reproduction Female mountain tapirs have a 30-day estrous cycle, and typically breed only once every other year. During courtship, the male chases the female and uses soft bites, grunts, and squeals to get her attention, while the female responds with frequent squealing. After a gestation period of 392 or 393 days, the female gives birth to a single young; multiple births are very rare. Newborn mountain tapirs weigh about and have a brown coat with yellowish-white spots and stripes. Like adults, baby mountain tapirs have thick, woolly fur to help keep them warm. Weaning begins at around three months of age. The immature coloration fades after about a year, but the mother continues to care for her young for around 18 months. Mountain tapirs reach sexual maturity at age three and have lived up to 27 years in captivity. Ecology Mountain tapir feeding Tapirs are herbivores, and eat a wide range of plants, including leaves, grasses, and bromeliads. In the wild, particularly common foods include lupins, Gynoxys, ferns, and umbrella plants. It also seeks out natural salt licks to satisfy its need for essential minerals. Mountain tapirs are also important seed dispersers within their environments, and have been identified as a keystone species of the high Andes. A relatively high proportion of plant seeds eaten by mountain tapirs successfully germinate in their dung, probably due to a relatively inefficient digestive system and a tendency to defecate near water. Although a wide range of seeds are dispersed in this manner, those of the endangered wax palm seem to rely almost exclusively on mountain tapirs for dispersal, and this plant, along with the highland lupine, declines dramatically whenever the animal is extirpated from an area. Predators of mountain tapirs include cougars, spectacled bears, and, less commonly, jaguars. Behaviour When around other members of their species, mountain tapirs communicate through high-pitched whistles, and the males occasionally fight over estrous females by trying to bite each other's rear legs. But for the most part, mountain tapirs are shy and lead solitary lives, spending their waking hours foraging for food on their own along well-worn tapir paths.Goudot, Justin. \\"Nouvelles observations sur le Tapir Pinchaque (Recent Observations on the Tapir Pinchaque),\\" Comptes Rendus, Paris 1843, vol. xvi, pages 331-334. Available online with English translation by Tracy Metz. Despite their bulk, they travel easily through dense foliage, up the steep slopes of their hilly habitats, and in water, where they often wallow and swim. Mountain tapirs are generally crepuscular, although they are more active during the day than other species of tapirs. They sleep from roughly midnight to dawn, with an additional resting period during the hottest time of the day for a few hours after noon, and prefer to bed down in areas with heavy vegetation cover. Mountain tapirs forage for tender plants to eat. When trying to access high plants, they will sometimes rear up on their hind legs to reach and then grab with their prehensile snouts. Though their eyesight is lacking, they get by on their keen senses of smell and taste, as well as the sensitive bristles on their proboscises. Males will frequently mark their territory with dung piles, urine, and rubbings on trees, and females will sometimes engage in these behaviors, as well. The territories of individuals usually overlap, with each animal claiming over , and females tend to have larger territories than males. Distribution and habitat The mountain tapir is found in the cloud forests and p√°ramo of the Eastern and Central Cordilleras mountains in Colombia, Ecuador, and the far north of Peru. Its range may once have extended as far as western Venezuela, but it has long been extirpated from that region. It commonly lives at elevations between , and since at this altitude temperatures routinely fall below freezing, the animal's woolly coat is essential. During the wet season, mountain tapirs tend to inhabit the forests of the Andes, while during the drier months, they move to the p√°ramo, where fewer biting insects pester them. The mountain tapir has no recognised subspecies. In Peru, it is protected in the National Sanctuary Tabaconas Namballe. The species needs continuous stretches of cloud forest and p√°ramo, rather than isolated patches, to successfully breed and maintain a healthy population, and this obstacle is a major concern for conservationists trying to protect the endangered animal. Evolution The mountain tapir is the least specialised of the living species of tapir, and has changed the least since the origin of the genus in the early Miocene. Genetic studies have shown that mountain tapirs diverged from its closest relative, the Brazilian tapir, in the late Pliocene, around three million years ago. This would have been shortly after the formation of the Panamanian Isthmus, allowing the ancestors of the two living species to migrate southward from their respective points of origin in Central America as part of the Great American Interchange. However, the modern species most likely originated in the Andes, some time after this early migration. Vulnerability 240px The mountain tapir is the most threatened of the five Tapirus species, classified as \\"Endangered\\" by the IUCN in 1996. According to the IUCN, there was a 20% chance the species could have been extinct as early as 2014. Due to the fragmentation of its surviving range, populations may already have fallen below the level required to sustain genetic diversity. Historically, mountain tapirs have been hunted for their meat and hides, while the toes, proboscises, and intestines are used in local folk medicines and as aphrodisiacs. Since they will eat crops when available, they are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their produce. Today, deforestation for agriculture and mining, and poaching are the main threats to the species. There may be only 2,500 individuals left in the wild today, making it all the more difficult for scientists to study them. Also, very few individuals are found in zoos. Only a handful of breeding pairs of this species exists in captivity in the world ‚Äî at the Los Angeles Zoo, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, and, as of 2006, the San Francisco Zoo.Eye on Conservation: Tale of the Tapir from the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens websiteMountain Tapir Conservation at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Podcast from the San Francisco Zoo In Canada, a mating pair is kept in Langley, BC, at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre. The nine individuals in captivity are descendants of just two founder animals. This represents a distinct lack of genetic diversity and may not bode well for their continued existence in captivity. The three zoos that house this species are working to ensure that the remaining wild populations of mountain tapirs are protected. Two mountain tapirs were sent from San Francisco Zoo to Cali Zoo, making them be the only captive tapirs in their natural home range; one male is kept in Pitalito, it could be moved to the Cali Zoo to make a breeding pair.

It is located near the village of Woodcroft in Gloucestershire, on the English side of the Wye Valley, north of Chepstow.  History  Wintour's Leap is named after Royalist Sir John Wintour who, hotly pursued on his horse by Parliamentary forces, according to local myth survived a leap off the cliff and, landing safely in the Wye below, swam to safety in the nearby Chepstow Castle. In fact, Wintour did escape from the Roundheads by using the river nearby on two separate occasions, but from less spectacular positions at Lancaut and Sedbury.Jeremy Knight, Civil War & Restoration in Monmouthshire, 2005,  Ownership  Wintour's Leap is owned by Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and forms part of the Lancaut SSSI Nature Reserve. The cliffs of Wintour's Leap are frequent nesting grounds for Peregrine Falcons and provide niches for rare Whitebeam trees. Climbing access is by permission of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust negotiated and supervised in consultation with the British Mountaineering Council. Climbing restrictions may apply.  Rock climbing  The area around Wintour's Leap is a very popular limestone rock climbing area. It contains over 300 recorded routes most of which are multi pitch. It has a high proportion of quality climbs up to 100 meters in length with something to offer all levels of climber. From south to north, the climbing areas are Woodcroft quarry, Fly Wall, GO Wall, South Bay, Far South Bay, North Wall, and far North Wall. Woodcroft quarry is behind Fly Wall and is the most recently developed area; routes are still being added (2009). The majority of the routes in the quarry are bolt protected sport routes of varying degrees of quality. The Fly Wall is the most convenient trad route area with a small number of well travelled (often polished) routes at HS & VS (See Grade (climbing)), and some good HVS - E5 routes. These two areas have recently (2009) come under the threat of development into a land fill site. Great Overhanging (GO) Wall is the largest cliff at Wintour's and contains 4 and 5 pitch extremes. The routes here are multi pitch 'trouser fillers' all of which are technical and steep. Many break through the massive overhangs near the top of the wall. The routes are in the range E2 - E6, but also includes the iconic 'must do' route 'Burning Giraffe' at HVS. The southern bays contain a number of easier and very good multipitch routes in the grade range of Mod - E2. The north wall consists again of rather steep multi pitch routes. Although there are 2 HS routes, and a number of very good VS routes. The far end of north wall is again very steep with stepped overhangs. The rock is also very compact, not lending itself to traditional protection. There is a lot of fixed gear here.

Sherwood (born March 5, 1941) is an American politician. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district, from 1999 to 2007. He was defeated for reelection by Democrat Chris Carney in November 2006. Biography =Personal life= Born in Nicholson, Pennsylvania, Sherwood attended Lackawanna Trail High School and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1963, and spent the next two years in the U.S. Army.Don Sherwood biography, United States Congress. Accessed May 31, 2007. He opened a Chevrolet-Pontiac dealership in Tunkhannock and became well known in northeastern Pennsylvania through his ads in the area. He was also one the original owner principals of Tunkhannock radio station WEMR, which first went on the air in 1986. Though he has since sold the radio station, the car dealership is still owned by his family. He is married and has three daughters. Sherwood began his political career in 1975, when he was elected to the Tunkhannock Area School Board. He served on this panel for 23 years, the last six as board president. =Congressional career= In 1998, Sherwood won the Republican nomination to replace 10th District Congressman Joseph McDade, who was retiring after serving 36 years in Congress. He barely won the general election that year, edging out Democrat Patrick Casey, son of former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey, by 515 votes. Some believe McDade's 11th-hour endorsement of Sherwood made the difference, even though Sherwood is considerably more conservative than McDade. He almost certainly got an additional boost from Governor Tom Ridge's landslide reelection victory. Sherwood narrowly defeated Casey again in 2000, most likely helped by George W. Bush narrowly winning the district. For the better part of half a century, the 10th had been a relatively compact district covering the northeastern corner of the state, stretching just far enough to the south to grab Scranton, by far its largest city. The 10th had long been considered a swing district, though Republicans had held the seat since 1961. Redistricting by the Pennsylvania legislature after the 2000 census made Sherwood somewhat safer. The legislature shifted heavily Democratic Scranton, home to some 60 percent of the district's population, to the Wilkes-Barre based 11th, already a Democratic stronghold. In its place, the legislature added some more rural territory that had previously been in the heavily Republican 5th District. Sherwood successfully ran for re-election from this new, much more Republican district against third-party Kurt Shotko in 2002 and 2004, in both cases winning with over 80 percent of the vote. In 2002, he was named to the PoliticsPA list of Best Dressed Legislators. =Extramarital affair/report of abuse = On September 15, 2004, a woman locked herself inside the bathroom of Sherwood's Washington, D.C. apartment, and called 911 to report she was assaulted. When police arrived, the woman, Cynthia Ore, accused Sherwood of choking her, though he maintained he was only giving her a backrub. No charges were filed because both Sherwood and Ore refused to provide any details. The report of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department stated, \\"Both parties have left out significant information or are not willing to discuss in detail what actually happened.\\" The details of that incident went unnoticed until 2005, when Veronica Hannevig, who ran against Sherwood on the right wing Constitution Party ticket in 2004, distributed a copy of the police report to several newspapers and television stations. Sherwood initially contended that Ore was merely a \\"casual acquaintance\\". He eventually admitted he had a five-year extramarital affair with Ore, but denied abusing her. Ore later filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against Sherwood, accusing him of repeatedly assaulting her during their relationship. On November 8, 2005, Sherwood and Ore ended the lawsuit by reaching a settlement, the terms of which were not released. On November 3, 2006, the Associated Press reported that a source had revealed the terms of Sherwood's settlement with Ore. The story reports that Sherwood agreed to pay her about $500,000 but a confidentiality clause requires Ore to forfeit some of the money if she talks publicly about the case. It also reported that Ore had, as of November 3, received only about half of the money and that she would receive the other half after the November 7 election, giving Ore \\"a powerful incentive for her to keep quiet until after Election Day.\\" The Ore incident damaged Sherwood‚Äôs standing with some Republicans. In April 2006, Martha Rainville, a Republican running for the U.S. House seat in Vermont, announced that she would return a campaign contribution from Sherwood‚Äôs political action committee. She cited her belief in \\"strong family values\\". But Sherwood received strong support from Republican leaders for the 2006 Republican primary in his district (see below). =2006 re-election campaign= Primary In the Republican primary on May 15, 2006, Sherwood was held to 56 percent of the vote against political newcomer Kathy Scott. Sherwood received 56% of the vote. CQPolitics reported that his \\"mediocre showing\\" could be attributed to the admitted affair. Scott did not file a report with the FEC, which indicates that she spent less than $5,000 in her campaign. Prior to the primary, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum endorsed Sherwood and recorded an automated telephone call on Sherwood‚Äôs behalf, as did President George W. Bush. Sherwood also received campaign contributions from several political action committees of other Republican members of the House. General election In the general election in November, Sherwood lost to Democrat Chris Carney, a former Defense Department consultant and navy lieutenant commander. Carney criticized Sherwood's record on the issues, but also ran what the Associated Press described as \\"a hard- hitting commercial focusing on the [extramarital] affair\\". The ad quoted a voter saying, \\"This incident with Don Sherwood just cuts right at the core values of our district.\\" The background displayed the text \\"repeatedly choking\\" and \\"attempting to strangle plaintiff\\", taken from the lawsuit filed by Ore against Sherwood. Sherwood countered with a television ad in which he apologized for his affair with Ore, but denied ever abusing her. Addressing viewers, Sherwood said, \\"While I'm truly sorry for disappointing you, I never wavered from my commitment to reduce taxes, create jobs and bring home our fair share.\\" He added, \\"Should you forgive me, you can count on me to keep on fighting hard for you and your family.\\" Carney defeated Sherwood in the election, 53% to 47%.

The station is named for Charles Circle and the adjacent Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) campus. It has two side platforms, with a glass-walled headhouse structure inside Charles Circle. Charles/MGH station is fully accessible. The Cambridge subway opened in 1912; planning for an infill station at Charles Street began in 1924. After several false starts, construction of Charles station began in 1931. The Art Deco station, with cast stone headhouse and copper-sheathed platforms, opened on February 27, 1932. A pedestrian tunnel that provided station access was replaced by footbridges in 1961. The station was renamed Charles/MGH in 1973. From 2003 to 2007, the station was renovated for accessibility; a new glass entrance replaced the original structure. The proposed Red‚ÄìBlue connector would extend the Blue Line to Charles/MGH, with a new underground platform level. Station design alt=An elevated railway station in an urban area. The left half is patinaed copper; the right half curved glass. Charles/MGH station is located at Charles Circle at the west end of the West End and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The station is on a short elevated segment that connects tracks in the median of the Longfellow Bridge to the west with an incline into the Beacon Hill Tunnel to the east. The two elevated side platforms, above ground level, run west from Charles Circle onto the east end of the Longfellow Bridge. At their east ends, the platforms widen into passageways that lead to elevators, escalators, and stairs to the surface- level fare lobby in the center of Charles Circle. The station entrance is on the west side of the fare lobby under the tracks, with crosswalks connecting to the sidewalks on both sides of Cambridge Street. The fare lobby and passageways are wrapped in a teardrop-shaped curved glass facade, while most of the platforms have a patinaed copper windscreen. History =Opening= alt=A black-and-white image of a railway viaduct with a steel frame under construction around it The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened its Cambridge Subway from Park Street Under to Harvard on March 23, 1912. The line ran in the median of the Longfellow Bridge to cross the Charles River. Like the Lechmere extension opened the same year and the Boylston Street subway opened in 1914, the Cambridge Subway originally had no station serving the area just outside downtown Boston, to speed travel time from farther stations. Although Bowdoin opened on an extension of the East Boston Tunnel in 1916, much of the West End and Beacon Hill neighborhoods were poorly served by the subway system. On June 2, 1924, the Massachusetts General Court passed legislation authorizing the state Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to construct an infill station at Charles Street. Following a 1924 study by the Boston Transit Department (BTD), the DPU delegated the project to the BTD on January 12, 1925. That study also considered an extension of the East Boston Tunnel to Charles Street to provide a transfer between the lines. The project stalled in 1926 as the $600,000 appropriated by the legislature was only sufficient for four-car platforms, while the BERy insisted on six-car platforms at a cost of $850,000 to accommodate its future plans. Despite pressure from the Massachusetts General Hospital, located adjacent to the proposed station site, the legislature again refused additional funding in 1927. Uncertainty over whether the station would be built delayed plans to construct a traffic circle at the intersection. No further progress was made until 1930, when the BERy and BTD reached an agreement for a $350,000 station with four-car platforms. The cost reduction was achieved by having the platforms on the straight track west of Charles Street, rather than the curve to the east. Plans for the station were completed in July 1930. Bidding on the station opened in early July 1931, and a construction contract was awarded later that month. Charles Circle was completed in November 1931, by which time the steel structure of the station was in place in the center of the traffic circle. Charles station opened on February 27, 1932. The station was served by Bowdoin Square‚ÄìPark Square and Charles station‚ÄìMassachusetts station bus routes, though a Kendall Square‚ÄìBowdoin Square route was closed with the station's opening. Charles station was designed by H. Parker from the office of Richard Clipston Sturgis. The three-story headhouse structure, , was framed with steel and clad in cast stone. The first story had a rough finish, while the double-height second story and the third story (divided into two by the tracks) were smooth. The structure was Art Deco/Art Moderne in style, with decorative pilasters and a chevron panel. The platforms had copper windscreens, also in Art Deco style. A north-south pedestrian underpass crossed the traffic circle, with stairs leading from the underpass to the station entrance. Only the north half of the underpass was originally planned; public pressure resulted in the addition of the south half. A 14-story Art Deco tower over the station, designed by H. F. Kellogg, was proposed but never built. =Modifications and the MBTA= alt=An aerial view of an elevated railway station with footbridges on either side In 1961, the pedestrian underpass was replaced by a pair of footbridges, with the south footbridge forked to reach both sides of Charles Street. The second story was modified to serve as a fare mezzanine, with a low ceiling under the trackway. Openings were cut in the walls to accommodate the footbridges. Around half of pedestrian traffic on the footbridges was crossing the circle rather than using the station, which caused congestion in the mezzanine area. In 1964, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) replaced the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which had replaced the BERy in 1947. The MBTA designated the line as the Red Line in 1965. In December 1973, the station was renamed Charles/MGH after the nearby Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Three southbound trains collided inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel just south of the station on August 1, 1975, injuring 132 passengers. In 1982, the platforms were extended west to allow for use of six-car trains, which began operation in 1988. Surveys in 1984 and 1987 found that the station was not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. =Reconstruction= alt=A curved glass entrances building for an elevated railway station The MBTA renovated most Red Line stations for accessibility in the 1980s and 1990s. Planning began for modifications to Charles/MGH in the late 1990s. Although the station was determined to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register, it was in poor condition: the cast stone cladding was spalled and cracked, water infiltration had rusted steel and damaged plaster, and the mezzanine level was overcrowded. The platforms were pitted, columns were rusted, and paint was peeling. Three options were developed in a 2000 design report: rehabilitation of the existing station with added elevators, a new surface=level station entrance slightly to the east inside the traffic circle, and a surface-level entrance at Cedar Street with a footbridge above the tracks and ramps down to the platforms. The second option was recommended. In June 2003, the MBTA began its $34.4 million reconstruction of the station ‚Äì part of a $48.6 million project that also realigned Charles Circle. Temporary staircases directly to the platforms were opened in May 2004. The pedestrian bridges were removed, and the original headhouses were demolished in July 2004. The new glass headhouse was built slightly to the east of the former headhouse location. The copper platform enclosures were restored with new interior cladding to preserve some of the historic station architecture. The new entrance opened on February 17, 2007, making the station fully accessible. Public art created by the community from recycled materials was installed in the fare lobby in June 2007. The renovations made the station no longer eligible for National Register inclusion. The renovation received the \\"Honor Award\\" from the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board in 2009. =Proposed Blue Line connection= alt=Side and top views of blueprints of a subway station and connection to an elevated station The Red‚ÄìBlue connector is a proposed extension of the Blue Line from west under Cambridge Street, providing a direct transfer between the Red and Blue lines. The project was first proposed in 1924, and was returned to consideration in the 1978 update to the Program for Mass Transportation. In 1991, the state agreed to built the project by 2011 as part of the settlement of a lawsuit over auto emissions from the Big Dig project. This commitment was changed to design only in 2007‚Äì08 and lifted entirely in 2015. Original plans for the connector in 1986 called for a cut-and-cover tunnel extension west from Bowdoin, with an underground stub-end terminal connected to the existing Charles/MGH station. Three configurations for the Blue Line level at Charles/MGH were considered: a three-track terminal with two island platforms, a two-track terminal with one island platform and pocket tracks to the east, and a three-track terminal with one island platform (one track not used for passenger service) and pocket tracks to the east. The 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report instead called for a pair of deeper tunnels bored by a tunnel boring machine (TBM); the Charles/MGH terminal would have a single island platform with tail tracks extended to the west. A 2018 update which analyzed multiple tunneling methods maintained this station configuration.

Nadars are predominant in the districts of Kanyakumari, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. The Nadar community was not a single caste, but developed from an assortment of related subcastes, which in course of time came under the single banner Nadar. Nadar climbers were the largest subsect of today's Nadar community. A few subsects of the Nadar community, such as the Nelamaikkarars, were traditionally wealthy landlords and money lenders. Historically, most Nadars were cultivators of palmyra trees and jaggery and a few were also involved in the toddy trade. Nadar climbers had faced discrimination from major upper castes in some regions. The martial art of Varma Kalai was historically practised by the Nadars. The socio-economic development achieved by the Nadars in southern India has elicited academic interest. Nadars are classified and listed as an Other Backward Class by the governments of both Tamil Nadu and India. Etymology The community was previously known as Shanar but legally changed their name to Nadar in 1921. The title Nadar is believed to be derived from the Nelamaikkarars, the aristocrats of the Shanar community who had previously used it exclusively. Nadars claim that the original name of the community was Shantror or Shandrar (noble one) which, in course of time, was corrupted to Shanar. Channar is a title used by the Ezhava community of Kerala. However, there is no evidence to support these claims. History The origin of Nadars as a social group is uncertain. Hardgrave stated that the Teri palmyra forests around today's Tiruchendur must have been their original abode. In the late 19th century, some Nadar activists started claiming that the Nadars are the descendants of those who ruled the Pandyan kingdom and that when Nayak rulers captured the Pandya country, it was divided into several Palayams (divisions) for each of which Palaiyakkars were appointed as rulers. They also claimed that the Nayak rulers of Tamil Nadu imposed Deshaprashtam (ostracism) on the ancient Nadars to ensure that they would not rise. According to Hardgrave these claims were not completely baseless. The traditions followed by the Nelamaikkarars and the existence of the ruins beneath the Teri palmrya forests of Tiruchendur and the Pandyan capital city of Korkai, where the Nadar population is predominant, suggest they could very well be the heirs of the Early Pandyas. However, there is little evidence to support the community's claim to be descendants of the later Pandya rulers. The identity or caste of the Pandyan kings remains a mystery. This belief, that the Nadars had been the kings of Tamil Nadu, became the dogma of the Nadar community in the 19th century. According to legendary accounts, some of the Nadars had migrated to Sri Lanka, but they had to return to India as they didn't receive proper treatment in Sri Lanka. Nadars of the 19th century In the early nineteenth century, the Nadars were a community mostly engaged in the palmyra industry, including the production of toddy. However, there were a few subsects comprising wealthy landlords and money lenders.Bishop Stephen Neill: from Edinburgh to South India By Dyron B. Daughrity At this time, the majority of Nadars lived south of the Thamirabarani River, and formed 80 - 90 per cent of the population between there and Cape Comorin. Although numerically dominant in the area, the Nadars had a minimal interaction with other communities and they were themselves divided by their various endogamous subcastes, and thus lacked communal cohesion. While the majority of the Nadar population in the south of Thamirabarani river were poor, landless palmyra climbers, there also existed a small endogamous sub group of aristocratic Nadars, known as the Nelamaikarrars or Nadans, who owned vast tracts of land. These Nadans either held their position directly under Nayak rulers in the Tiruchendur area or as petty lords under the Palaiyakkarar. They commanded high respect among the population, including from groups such as the Nadar climbers, the minority Vellalars and the Brahmins. Nadan men rode horses and their women rode in covered palanquins. Nadar climbers were also to be found in other regions of Tamil Nadu where a few palmyra trees grew. In areas where the Nadar climber population consisted of only a few families in a village, they faced discrimination from major upper castes. Due to their association with toddy, the Nadars were considered lower than other middle castes, but relatively higher than the low castes, and were also prohibited to enter temples built by higher ranked castes. Although associated with toddy, the Nadars did not themselves consume it. The Nadars were schismatic about their position in the caste hierarchy and firmly claimed that they were wrongly placed in the caste system due to the Nayak invasion. They were also very caste conscious. =Nadars of Travancore= Hardgrave conjectures that the Nadars of Southern Travancore migrated there from Tirunelveli in the 16th century after the invasion of Tirunelveli by the Raja of Travancore. Like their Tirunelveli counterparts, the Nadars of Travancore were mostly palmyra climbers. However, a significant number of Nadars were subtenants to Nair or Vellalar landlords. These aristocratic Nadars called themselves Nadans and some of them had direct control over their lands. The Nadans enjoyed special privileges under the Raja and claimed that they were superior to the climbers. The climbers of Travancore fared a little better than their Tirunelveli counterparts, but suffered severe social disabilities not found in Tirunelveli due to Travancore's rigid caste hierarchy. As Swami Vivekananda stated, the Keralite hierarchy was a lunatic asylum of castes. One example of the social disabilities was that Nadar climber women were not allowed to cover their bosoms to punctuate their low status. However, the Nadan women of the region were exempted from this restriction. Discontented with their social status, a large number of Nadar climbers embraced Christianity and became upwardly mobile. Although they improved their status with the aid of Christian missionaries, the outcome of their conversion did not conform to the intent of those missionaries. Both the Christian and Hindu Nadar climber women wore the upper jacket in the manner of upper-class women, in order to improve their social status. In turn, upper-class men abused and discriminated against them. One Nadan family of Agastheeswaram, instead of supporting their depressed counterparts, supported the upper-class men and claimed that only their women had the right to wear an upper cloth. The situation became known as the Upper cloth controversy and became violent. Eventually, with assistance from the Travancore authorities, British Christian Missionaries and Vaikunta Swamy, the depressed Nadar climber women won the right to wear their upper cloth in the manner of their Nadan counterparts. =Northern Nadars= Some petty Nadar traders migrated from southern Tirunelveli to northern Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. Over time they became commercially skilled and by the late 19th century were socially aspirant. Mercantilism played a crucial role in facilitating their upward mobility but religion was also perceived as a vehicle. Around 10 percent of the community converted to Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant. British rule in the southern districts introduced new opportunities for trade and commerce, of which the Nadars took advantage. They established sophisticated pettais (fortified compounds) and urvinmurais (local caste associations) to ensure safety for their goods. Members of the uravinmurai, who were known as muraikkarars, would contribute a portion of their income to the association as mahimai (literally, to glorify oneself), in order to use the facilities of the pettais and to improve the common good. As the wealth of the Northern Nadars increased they began also to adopt the customs of the North Indian Kshatriyas in order to improve their social status, in a process now known as Sanskritisation. Many tried to disassociate themselves from their Nadar climber counterparts and the term Shanar (the term generally used to call a Tamil palmrya climber). They adopted the title of Nadan, previously used only by the Nelamaikkarars. To demonstrate their wealthy and powerful social position, the Nadars of Sivakasi hired Maravar palanquin bearers. The upward mobility and kshatriya pretensions of the Nadars of the six towns of Ramanad caused resentment among both the Vellalar and the Maravar castes, who were ritually ranked above the Nadars. The outcome was a series of caste conflicts, including the Sivakasi riots of 1899. However, the Sankritisation movement was a failure initially and the Nadar climbers, who lived as minorities, were still discriminated by the majority castes. However these confrontations aided the community to protest for the required rights and privileges, with integrity, and also test how much other communities were willing to accept the Nadar claims of high status. The Northern Nadar leaders then sought to unite their community by encouraging intermarriages within the five major Nadar subcastes and also uplift the depressed palmrya Nadar climbers. They also sought to maintain amiable relationships with other communities. This led to the formation of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam in 1910. =Sri Lanka= Some Nadars emigrated from South India to Sri Lanka during the British colonial era.\\"Seventeenth century Tamilaham as gleaned from Jesuit letters\\", by M. Arumairaj, p. 200, original from = University of California Nadars of the 20th century Rao Bahadur T. Rattinasami Nadar, founder of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam =Nadar Mahajana Sangam= The separate Nadar associations of the six Ramanad towns were unable to support a community that was becoming more dispersed as many began to migrate to other parts of Madras Presidency. With the rise of the politically ambitious T. Rattinasami Nadar, a wealthy Nadar of Porayar in Thanjavur district, a new association was formed. This resulted from Rattinasami Nadar inviting prominent community leaders to attend a plenary session in February 1910, with the intent of establishing an organization to represent the entire community. Rattinasami Nadar's uncle, V. Ponnusami Nadar, was elected to become the first president of the association, which was called the Nadar Mahajana Sangam. The association was open to any Nadar male of any subcaste or religion, and had as its general purpose the upliftment of the community. The early Sangam conferences were dominated by the Northern Nadars. =Against toddy= The campaign against toddy was one of the first steps taken by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam to enhance the social advancement of the entire Nadar community. Though majority of the Nadar climbers were engaged in the production of jaggery, a significant number of Nadar climbers were also involved in the production of toddy. The Sangam urged the Nadar climbers to abandon their traditional occupation of toddy tapping and not to sell hard toddy. However many Nadar climbers were reluctant to give up their profitable occupation. The situation got out of hand when Nadar leaders tried to intimidate the climbers, by using tenets of their cult, to give up their occupation as toddy tappers. To ease the situation the district magistrate issued a proclamation restricting the climbers to sell hard toddy only in specific regions, where toddy can be legally drawn. However the Sangam's campaign was effective for only about a year. =Prohibition of toddy act= The Sangam then in order to aid the climbers, sought to abolish the tax levied on palmyra trees. After the establishment of the Prohibition (of toddy) act in the Northern districts of Madras Presidency, the Nadar Mahajana Sangam along with its sister association, Dakshina Mara Nadar Sangam of Tirunelveli, sought to remove it to aid the depressed climbers. The British advisor government in turn suspended the act. However, the prohibition act was reintroduced after the independence. Under the rules of the act, the climbers could only tap between 4 am to 2pm and sell sweet toddy between 6am and 2pm. These procedures can also only be practiced by climbers who have license. The rigid government rules pressurized the depressed climbers. The two prominent Nadars Sangams constantly pressurized the government and eventually the enforcement of these regulations gradually eased. By the mid-1950s, the government assigned cooperative societies to promote jaggery production. =Nadar educational institutions= The Nadar community did not completely rely on the Backward Class Commission for educational advancement. In 1885, the Northern Nadars established the Kshatriya Vidhyasala High School in Virudhunagar by using the mahimai funds from the Nadar uravinmurai. Education was also the primary concern of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam from inception. In 1921, the Sangam began to provide scholarship loans to needy students, and by 1964 more than 3000 such loans were offered. Some students were given assistance for foreign studies. The Sangam also aided the establishment of village schools. Education formed the largest portion of expenditure by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam. The Nadar bank along with other cooperative societies gave 5 percent of their profit to the scholarship fund. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam also established a college, Senthilkumara Nadar College, in 1947. =Resolution of inter-caste conflicts= In villages where there were few Nadar climbers, they were oppressed by those in the majority. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam acted in the interests of such climbers, using the strength and influence of the community at large. The climbers could ask the Sangam to intervene in inter-community issues, which would cause the Sangam to investigate the situation and determine the validity of any Nadar claims. Then, if necessary, the Sangam would request police intervention or support a claim in court. In situations where the matter went to court, the Sangam would not provide financial support for the Nadar claimant to contest the case, but would rather see that the claim is properly heard. After independence of India, the Sangam took advantage of the constitutional provisions encouraging a caste-less society and also supported government attempts to promote this vision. The support included urging their own community members to allow use of their schools, tanks, temples and wells by other communities. The name of the Nadar bank was changed to Tamilnad Mercantile Bank. These activities earned the Nadar community respect and recognition.Most of the shops in Ranganathan Street, Tamil Nadu's premier high street, are owned by the Nadars. Politics In the 1920s and 1930s, Nadar Mahajan Sangam supported the non- Brahmin movement and Justice party. W. P. A. Soundrapandian Nadar as the president of Nadar Mahajana Sangam led the effort to ally the community with Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's Self-respect movement. The Northern Nadars joined the Justice party in its attack against Brahmins on cultural and religious front. They also practiced self-respect marriages during the non-Brahmin movement. However, in the late 1940s the Nadars' support shifted to Indian National Congress, in part because of the political success of K. Kamaraj, whose opinions had originally been disliked by his own community. After the end of Kamaraj's era, the Nadars' political support has become diffused across various parties and the Nadar Sangam has become less politicized. Nadars today The social and economical development achieved by the Nadars have evoked academic interest. According to N.S.Ramnath, of Forbes, the Nadars are a close knit, powerful community. The Nadars, who were once predominantly not allowed to enter Hindu temples built by castes above them, now occupy respected positions as Trustees in many Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu. They are financially strong and are politically influential in the Southern districts of Tamil Nadu. A political observer points out that there is a Nadar leader in almost every political party. The community has influential Tamil media houses, such as Dina Thanthi. Crawford Young has said that: =Government classification= Nadars are classified and listed as a Backward Class by the governments of both Tamil Nadu and India. Subcastes The legend of the origin of the Nadars tell of the birth of seven sons; with the death of two, the remaining five father the separate divisions of the community. There were five major divisions among the Nadars. The Nadar community was not a single caste, but developed from an assortment of related subcastes and classes of different origins, which in course of time, came under the single banner Nadar. Gazetteers of India Tamil Nadu state: Thoothukudi district by Sinnakani: Page 233-242 Nadar climber was the largest subsect of today's Nadar community. Nadars are predominant in the south Indian districts of Tuticorin, Kaniyakumari, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. =Karukkupattaiyathar= Palmrya climber in Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu The Karukkupattaiyathar are supposed to be the original inhabitants of the country around Manadu. This sub-division was later known as Mara Nadar. They claim to be the descendants of the Pandyans. It is the largest of the five subcastes and constitutes about 80 percent of the entire community, including the aristocratic Nelamaikkarars and the climbers beneath them. The Nelamaikarrars and the climbers are endogamous groups, forming sub-subcastes that each marry only among themselves. =Mel-nattar= The term Mel-nattar comes from Mel-nadu (western country). Mel-nattars lived traditionally in the Southern Travancore and Western Tirunelveli districts. They claim to be descendants of the Chera kings who settled in the area of the Western Ghats after the fall of their dynasty. Tiruvarudi Vaihunda Nadan, the last Zamindar of Nattathi. =Nattathi= At the time that Robert Hardgrave conducted his study, in the 1960s, the Nattathis were predominant in the village of Nattathi near Sawyerpuram, Tuticorin district. There they were traditionally cultivators, traders and money lenders. Legendary accounts claim that the Nattathis are descendants born of the Pandyas and Cholas. The community was mostly Christian and remained an endogamous unit. The overlord of Nattathi was a retainer of the Kattabomma Nayaka. The Nattathi overlord was invested with Zamindari rights under the British. The last of the Nattathi zamindars, Tiruvarudi Vaihunda Nadan, died in 1892. The properties of the Zamindar were eventually divided among a number of claimants. =Kodikal= They are traditionally palmrya climbers. They are supposed to have migrated to the Pandyan country from the banks of the Cauvery River in Tanjore to serve the Pandyan kings as their flag bearers. =Kalla= The Kalla Shanars were considered as the lowest division of the Nadar community. They are also known as Servai. The term kalla means \\"false\\". They are believed originally to have been palanquin bearers for the Pandyan kings or menial slaves of the Nelamaikkarar family, having descended from illegal unions within the Nadar community. They are traditionally toddy tappers. The subsect culture is not present today among the Nadars north of Tirunelveli but it still exists among those of southern Tirunelveli. The Karkuppatayathars, the endogamaous Nelamaikkarars and the Nadar climbers beneath them, are today known as A group or Mara Nadar, and the remaining four subcastes are known as B group.

A permanent mission was established in 1701. Some Nadars accepted Christianity through will and some accepted it due to their aversion to local beliefs. In 1970, Christian Nadars numbered 150,000 as opposed to 1.5 to 2 million Hindu Nadars in Madras state. Nadar Christians, like Hindus, marry within their caste. Religious customs The Hindu Nadars, like other Hindus, have a variety of religious rituals and ceremonies. These include procedures relating to birth, adulthood, marriage and death. Every Hindu Nadar belongs to a kuttam (assemblage) through patrilineal descent, and each kuttam has a common family deity. During migration, families would often take soil from their family temple and enshrine it at their new home. Traditionally, all the members of a kuttam would assemble at least once a year at the family temple. With the birth of a child, the family would traditionally go to the family deity temple, where the hair of the child is shaved for the first time and offered to the deity. At the time of marriage the first invitation is presented to the family deity. The Hindu Nadars are almost entirely Saivite (only one kuttam is Vaishnavite). Of the deities, Murugan has been widely popular among the Nadars. Goddess Bhadrakali is the tutelary deity of the Nadar community. The Nadars also claim that they are the descendants of Bhadrakali. A Bhadrakali temple is usually at the centre of almost every Nadar settlement. The socio-religious movement of Ayyavazhi was pioneered and patronized by the Nadar community. Martial arts The Nadars, traditionally practised a Tamil martial art variously known as Adimurai, chinna adi and varma adi. In recent years, since 1958, these have been referred to as Southern-style Kalaripayattu, although they are distinct from the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu itself that was historically the style found in Kerala.

He began his career as a dissident working towards the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories and was consequently imprisoned and tortured for his activism. When the Kingdom of Syria was established, Quwatli became a government official, though he was disillusioned with monarchism and co-founded the republican Independence Party. Quwatli was immediately sentenced to death by the French who took control over Syria in 1920. Afterward, he based himself in Cairo where he served as the chief ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, cultivating particularly strong ties with Saudi Arabia. He used these connections to help finance the Great Syrian Revolt (1925‚Äì1927). In 1930, the French authorities pardoned Quwatli and thereafter, he returned to Syria, where he gradually became a principal leader of the National Bloc. He was elected president of Syria in 1943 and oversaw the country's independence three years later. Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a military coup in 1949. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 to participate in the presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his political authority had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli's jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli's erstwhile ally, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Following months of unity talks, in 1958, Quwatli merged Syria with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic and stepped down for Nasser to serve as president. In gratitude, Nasser awarded Quwatli the honorary title of \\"First Arab Citizen\\". However, Quwatli grew disenchanted with the union, believing it had reduced Syria to a police state subordinate to Egypt. He backed Syria's secession in 1961, but plans for him to complete his presidential term afterward did not materialize. Quwatli left Syria following the 1963 Ba'athist coup, and he died of a heart attack in Lebanon weeks after Syria's defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War. He was buried in Damascus on 1 July. Personal life =Family= Quwatli and members of his family in Beirut 1966. From Left: Huda, Mahmud, Shukri al-Quwatli, Hassan, Bahira al-Dalati, Hala and Hana. The Quwatlis were a Sunni Muslim mercantile family from Baghdad which moved to Damascus in the 18th century, establishing itself in the district of al- Shaghour. Their initial wealth in Damascus stemmed from trade with Baghdad and Arabia. After 1860 the family invested part of its wealth in large land tracts in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The first member of the family to own extensive tracts was Shukri's granduncle Murad (d. 1908). The family's notable status was owed to their wealth, rather than an aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service. Shukri's grandfather Abd al-Ghani was involved in finance, as was his granduncle Ahmad, who was appointed the president of the Agricultural Bank of Damascus in 1894, and another granduncle, Hasan, president of the Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, while Murad had become a member of the Administrative Council of the city in 1871 and was re-elected in the early 1890s. Shukri's father's wealth rested on the highly fertile lands he owned and later bequeathed to Shukri and his siblings in the Ghouta. His elder brother Hasan was elected President of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture. Despite the substantial wealth accrued toward the end of the 19th century, the family remained in the working class al-Shaghur and developed networks there which contributed to its future political ambitions. In 1928, Shukri married Bahira al-Dalati, the 19-year-old daughter of nationalist Said al-Dalati, whom Quwatli met while in jail in 1916. Shukri and Bahira had five children; Hassan (the oldest, born in 1935), Mahmud, Huda, Hana and Hala. Bahira al-Dalati died in 1989. =Childhood and education= Shukri Quwatli was born in Damascus in 1891. He received his elementary education at a Jesuit school in the city, then studied at the preparatory high school of Maktab Anbar in the Jewish quarter of Damascus. He obtained his baccalaur√©at in 1908. He then moved to Istanbul where he studied political science and public administration. Quwatli graduated from the Mekteb-i M√ºlkiye in 1913.≈û√ºkr√º Kuvvetli kimdir? (in Turkish) He returned to Damascus in 1913 after receiving his diploma, and started working for the Ottoman civil service. Early influences Quwatli was initially brought up in a pro- Ottoman environment, owing to his family's connections in Istanbul. The restrictions of the Abdul Hamid II era, however, started to be felt around the Ottoman Empire, and discontent was brewing even among the empire's elite. Following the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908, parliamentary elections were called in all provinces, and liberal Arab intellectuals like Shukri al-Asali, Shafiq Muayyad al-Azm, and Rushdi al- Shama'a secured seats as deputies (members of the legislature) representing Damascus. The liberal current that established itself through these figures, and the political dailies they established including al-Qabas (\\"The Firebrand\\") and al-Ikha' al-Arabi (\\"Arab Brotherhood\\"), greatly influenced Quwatli and other Arab youths. During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, Quwatli strongly supported the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) against Abdul Hamid II. Nevertheless, after the failed countercoup, the CUP accused Arab provinces of supporting Abdul Hamid II and initiated a policy of Turkification, whereby all local officials were substituted by Turkish ones. Soon after, the parliament was dissolved, and the liberal Arab politicians were forced out in the following elections. Early nationalist activities Quwatli's early involvement in the Arab nationalist movement came through the Arab Congress of 1913. Shortly after starting his career at the Ottoman civil service in Damascus, he received an invitation to attend the conference in Paris. However, the conference was strongly condemned by the Ottoman authorities, and Arab notables were forbidden from attending. Nevertheless, the congress had succeeded in rousing nationalist feelings in Arab provinces. Quwatli's first confrontation with the Ottoman authorities came in February 1914 during a visit by Jamal Pasha, the governor of Syria at the time, to the offices of the Governorate of Damascus, where Quwatli worked. During the visit, Quwatli refused to follow the normal protocol‚Äîbending over and kissing Jamal Pasha's right hand‚Äîand was promptly thrown in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. He was bailed out of prison a few days later through his family's connections, but he lost his job at the civil service. =Al-Fatat= The growing hardships in the country during the early years of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the secret society of al-Fatat, which was facilitated by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri. Al-Fatat was an underground organization established in Paris in 1911 by Arab nationalists with the aim of gaining independence and unity of the various Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks. In 1915, Sharif Hussein, trying to garner support for his planned uprising against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly with other members of the society, including Quwatli, in the house of Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al- Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was charged by the al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture and humiliation. Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of that experience, however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition. In late 1916 he was approached by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved at the last minute by fellow inmate, al- Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria. Kingdom of Syria Quwatli (first from the bottom left) seated with members of the Syrian nationalist movement, 1920s. Seated next to Quwatli are Said al-Ghazzi, Riad al-Shurbaji, Sheikh Saleh al- Ali. Standing left to right are Hajj Adib Kheir and Ibrahim Hananu On 1 October 1918, an Arab army under the leadership of Emir Faisal and British general T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, and by the end of October the rest of Ottoman Syria fell to the Allied Forces. Emir Faisal became in charge of administering the liberated territory. He appointed Rida al-Rikabi as prime minister, and Quwatli's friend, Nasib al-Bakri became a personal adviser to the Emir. Quwatli, at the age of twenty-six, was appointed assistant to the governor of Damascus, Alaa al-Din al-Durubi. However, many of Quwatli's generation were unimpressed with Faisal's leadership skills, and were drawn to a republican, rather than monarchist, view of governance. Furthermore, they were suspicious of Faisal, and his brother Abdullah's ties with the British. On 15 April 1919 they founded a loose coalition under the name of al-Istiqlal Party (\\"Independence Party\\"). The party had a pan-Arab, secular, anti-British and anti-Hashemite outlook and attracted mostly youth activists from the elite classes. Well-known members, other than Quwatli, included Adil Arslan, Nabih al-Azmeh, Riad al-Sulh, Saadallah al-Jabiri, Ahmad Qadri, Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi. Although ostensibly working for the government, Quwatli devoted his efforts to nationalist activities outside the government's auspices. In addition to al-Istiqlal, he was also a member of the Palestinian- led Arab Club's Damascus branch. In a meeting with the 1919 King‚ÄìCrane Commission, sent by the United States (US) to gauge national sentiment in greater Syria, Quwatli rejected the notion of an American military presence in Syria, telling Crane that \\"Reduction of sovereignty is non-negotiable\\" and instead suggesting that the US help Syrians to \\"build their state and live in peace on their land.\\" Nevertheless, French forces had already started landing on the Syrian coast in 1919 to enforce the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement whereby France and the UK would divide up the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire between themselves. In March 1920, the League of Nations granted France a mandate over Syria and Lebanon, and in response Emir Faisal declared himself king of Syria on 8 March 1920. When King Faisal refused to accept the mandate, the French marched on Damascus. Yusuf al-'Azma, minister of defense at the time, led a small force and met the French at the Battle of Maysalun on 23 July 1920. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the French, and the next day French forces occupied Damascus. King Faisal was deported to Europe, and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon was officially declared. Leader in Syrian independence movement =Emissary of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress= The French started their rule by sentencing 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, to death on 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent the bulk of his time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian- Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists in Europe and in the Arab world. In Europe, he particularly frequented Berlin where he worked with the prominent Arab nationalist intellectual Shakib Arslan to proliferate anti-French sentiment, leading the French Mandatory authorities to label Quwatli one of the \\"most dangerous\\" Syrian exiles. He developed close ties with Ibn Saud, who by 1925 ruled much of Arabia, having overrun the Hashemites in the Hejaz. Quwatli had a prior relationship with the House of Saud, stemming from his own family's commercial links with the Saudis and Quwatli's friendship with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a Syrian adviser to Ibn Saud, who Quwatli had dispatched to Arabia during Faisal's rule. Quwatli, strongly distrustful of the Hashemites, was impressed by Ibn Saud's relatively quick conquest over much of Arabia and saw in the Saudis a strong potential ally against British and French imperialism in the Middle East. By 1925, Quwatli had solidified his position as the intermediary between Ibn Saud and the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. His acquisition of Saudi funding put him at odds with the Congress's chief financier Michel Lutfallah, however. =Financing the Great Syrian Revolt= In the summer of 1925 tensions between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini to set up a financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection. =Role in the National Bloc= In late 1927, Quwatli headed the Istiqlal-dominated Executive Committee of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, although Lutfallah headed a separate rival committee that also called itself the Congress's Executive Committee. Both were based in Cairo. Locally known then as the \\"apricot king\\", Quwatli used revenues from his agricultural lands to build up a network of support in the Old City of Damascus. In 1930, Quwatli was allowed to return to Syria under a general amnesty. Thereafter, he joined the National Bloc, the preeminent opposition movement in Syria‚Äîthough tolerated by the French. Although he opposed the moderate stances of the Bloc's Damascene leaders, he determined he could only remain a major political player by joining the group. He sought to steer it towards a more determined nationalist course and worked to expand his support base, relying on his relationships with residents in some of Damascus' traditionally nationalist neighborhoods (al-Midan and al-Shaghour) and among the city's merchant and emerging industrialist classes. He also worked to draw support from the staunch pan-Arabists of the League of National Action (LNA) beginning in 1933. He managed to co-opt much of the LNA's members by 1935‚Äì36 by financing its land development company (which aimed to prevent land sales to Zionist organizations in Palestine) and assigning some of its leaders to the director boards of companies affiliated with the Bloc. In 1936, as a general strike was underway in the country to demand a renegotiation of the French role in Syria, Quwatli was appointed the Bloc's vice president of internal affairs, but was not part of the treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established by the end of the month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks in Syria, convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc's highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey. On 20 March 1941, during World War II, when the Vichy French were in control of Syria, Quwatli called for immediate Syrian independence amid a period of food shortages, high unemployment and widespread nationalist rioting in the country. Vichy troops in the country were defeated by the Allied forces in July and Quwatli left Syria during the campaign. He returned in 1942. France officially recognized Syria's independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and national elections were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities. First presidential term =Election of 1943= Prior to the 1943 national elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French authorities attempted to negotiate with Quwatli as head of the National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people would view such negotiations negatively. He was also confident that the National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943. =Syrian independence= Quwatli declaring Syria's independence from France, 17 April 1946 As president, Quwatli continued to press for Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning Syria with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response to French Mandatory rule led to French military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in Syria to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli's request for intervention, British troops invaded Syria from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in Syria as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of communication in the region. As French troops began a partial withdrawal from the country, Quwatli instructed Fares al-Khoury, his envoy to the US and head of the Syrian mission to the United Nations, to bring the issue of Syria's independence to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), cabling Khoury to \\"Go to [US President Harry] Truman and tell him the French have ploughed the land in Syria, over our heads!\\" Khoury proceeded to petition the UNSC to force France's withdrawal from Syria. The US and UK backed Syria's request and informed Quwatli that British troops were in control of Syria, requesting Quwatli's cooperation in enforcing an evening curfew in the country. Quwatli complied and expressed his gratitude to the British government. At a summit between France, the UK, the US, Russia and China, France agreed to withdraw from both Syria and Lebanon in return for British promises to withdraw its military from the Levant region as well. Quwatli was angered that Syria was left out of the conference and requested a summit with Truman and Winston Churchill, which was rebuffed. The transfer of administrative powers to the Syrian government began on 1 August, the day in which Quwatli announced the establishment of the Syrian Army and his position as the commander in chief. Quwatli also asked Khoury to form a cabinet, which was established on 24 August. The French completed their withdrawal from Syria on 15 April 1946 and Quwatli declared Syria's independence day on 17 April. =Post-independence politics= Following Syria's independence, the National Bloc was dissolved and replaced by the National Party. Quwatli's leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People's Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party as well as the Baath Party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People's Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli's Aleppo-based ally. In early 1947, Quwatli and the National Party, the largest party in parliament, made an amendment to the constitution to enable Quwatli to seek re-election. The move was met by strong disapproval from rival Syrian parties and opposition politicians, and a campaign to unseat Quwatli in the next presidential election was commenced. Quwatli's allies won 24 out of 127 seats during the 1947 parliamentary election, the first in post-independence Syria, while the opposition won 53 seats and independents unaffiliated with any political party won 50. A number of Quwatli's allies defected from the National Party and former president Atassi retired from politics because of his frustration at Quwatli's handling of Syrian internal affairs. Quwatli tasked Jamil Mardam Bey to form a new cabinet in October, which included mostly pro-Western politicians. Despite the heavy presence of pro-American figures in the cabinet and Quwatli's initially warm ties with the US, relations between the two countries began to unravel amid the nascent Cold War and the view that Quwatli was becoming a detriment to US interests in the region. Quwatli developed close relations with the SCP and its head Khalid Bakdash, which was a contributing factor to the US Congress's rejection of Quwatli's arms request for the Syrian Army in late 1947. Quwatli also rejected the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline in Syria (to connect the oilfields of Saudi Arabia to Lebanon). Quwatli feared construction of the pipeline would threaten the mostly British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and upset the UK, as well as the Syrian public, who he believed would view the project \\"as a new form of indirect foreign economic control\\", according to Moubayed. US support for Israel, particularly under Truman, and Quwatli's adamant opposition to Zionism was a further source of tension. Second presidential term =Election of 1948= With the constitution amended to allow for a president to seek more than one term, Quwatli ran against Khalid al-Azm for another five-year term and won by a slim majority on 18 April 1948. =1948 Arab-Israeli War= Quwatli opposed the proposed partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, arguing that the plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state, violated the rights of the Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and to take the place of Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately. The Syrian Army, which consisted of 4,500 soldiers, had been mostly repelled in their offensive during the first few days of the war, gaining control over a small area along the Syrian border. As a result of the army's poor showing, Quwatli pressed defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati to resign his post, which Sharabati did on 24 May. He then replaced chief of staff Abdullah Atfeh with Husni al-Zaim during that same period of the war. Following the war, Quwatli accused Zaim of military incompetence and his officers of profiteering. In turn, Zaim accused Quwatli of mismanagement during the conflict. The Syrian public did not spare Quwatli blame for the army's poor performance, causing his popularity, built on his nationalist reputation, to erode further. The Syrian press was also sharply critical of Quwatli and Prime Minister Mardam Bey, urging them to leave their positions. Mardam Bey resigned on 22 August 1948 and was replaced by Khalid al-Azm. Mass demonstrations took place in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for recognizing Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. US officials were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations. When Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon signed armistice agreements with Israel between February and April 1949, Syria under Quwatli did not do so and refused to send a delegation to attend truce negotiations in Rhodes in March. =Coup d'√©tat of 1949= On 29 March 1949, Zaim launched a coup d'√©tat, overthrowing Quwatli. Zaim's troops entered Damascus and raided Quwatli's home. They disarmed his guard and confronted Quwatli in his night clothes before army officer Ibrahim al-Husseini arrested him. After being allowed to change his clothes, Quwatli was taken by the authorities to the city's Mezzeh Prison. Prime Minister al-Azm was also arrested. The coup had been backed and allegedly co-planned with the US Central Intelligence Agency. The US was the first country to recognize Zaim's government, followed by the UK, France, and the Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan. Quwatli's mother died of a heart attack about a week after his overthrow. Exile in Egypt As a result of pressure from the Egyptian and Saudi governments to spare the life of their ally Quwatli, al-Zaim agreed to release Quwatli from prison in mid-April 1949. After officially resigning as President, Quwatli was exiled to Alexandria, Egypt. In Egypt he was respected as a guest of honor by King Farouk and after the July 1952 revolution, by the Free Officers who gained power. Despite his positive relationship with the ousted King Farouk, Quwatli developed a close friendship with the founder of the Free Officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became Egypt's leader in 1954.

From right to left: Sabri al-Asali, Fares al-Khoury, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, Quwatli, Mohamed Ali Eltaher, Nazim al-Qudsi, Amin al-Husayni and Muin al-Madi Quwatli returned to Syria in 1955, following the ouster of President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, at the age of 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli. Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali resigned from his post on 6 September following the Ba'ath Party's withdrawal from the cabinet. As a result, Quwatli attempted to nominate Lutfi al-Haffar as Prime Minister, but reneged after opposition from the Ba'athists. Afterward, Quwatli asked Rushdi al-Kikhiya to form a cabinet, but the latter refused, citing that influence from the Syrian Army would deprive his government of real power. President Nasser of Egypt recommended the reappointment of Asali, but Quwatli refused, instead opting for Said al-Ghazzi, an independent. Ghazzi agreed and subsequently presided over a national unity government. =Adoption of neutralism= Quwatli (left) with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt (right) and King Saud of Saudi Arabia (center) concluding a defense agreement between the three countries, 1956 Under Quwatli's leadership, Syria increasingly moved towards a neutralist policy amid the Cold War, despite the conservative views held by Quwatli. However, on 10 September, Quwatli first opted to make an official request for arms from the United States, but was eventually rebuffed despite support from US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Starting in 1956, Quwatli began to look towards the Eastern bloc for economic and military assistance. During the tenure of his administration, Quwatli furthered Syria's relations with other neutralist countries such as Yugoslavia, India and Egypt, but also with the Soviet Union (USSR) and the Eastern bloc. The pursuit of this policy was partially due to the support afforded to the leftist movements in Syria by the Saudi and Egyptian governments who viewed them as strong opponents of the Baghdad Pact, and the highly influential leftist factions of the Syrian Army. Quwatli and Nasser initiated the Egyptian-Syrian Agreement, a defense arrangement that would serve as a counterweight to the Baghdad Pact, in March 1955. The agreement stipulated that each country would assist the other in case of an attack, the establishment of numerous committees to coordinate joint military activities and the creation of a joint military command headed by Egyptian officer Abdel Hakim Amer. The agreement was concluded 20 October. Increasingly concerned at the growing leftist trend in the country, Quwatli called for a national unity government that would include parties from across the political spectrum on 15 February 1956. Despite opposition from the Ba'athists, Quwatli managed to preside over a \\"national covenant\\" which entailed a foreign policy of opposition to Zionism and imperialism as well as the adoption of neutralism amid the Cold War. Nonetheless, and against Quwatli's advice, Ghazzi resigned from his post in June 1956 as a result of pressure from the Ba'athists and the communists who had been leading protests against Ghazzi's decision to lift the ban on wheat sales to Western Europe. Faced with few options, Quwatli reappointed Asali as Prime Minister. Asali moved to further strengthen ties with Egypt, including a pledge to start unity talks, and appointed Ba'athists to the ministerial positions of economy and foreign affairs. Following the tripartite invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal by British, French and Israeli forces in October 1956, Quwatli severed ties with Britain. Quwatli sent hundreds of army recruits to aid the Egyptian defense and made an emergency visit to Moscow to request Soviet backing for Nasser from Premier Nikita Khrushchev, telling the latter that the tripartite forces \\"want to destroy Egypt!\\" In response to public pressure, in late December Prime Minister Asali reshuffled his cabinet, removing several fellow conservatives and strengthening leftist influence in the government. =Confronting leftist influence= In July 1957, relations between Quwatli's ally Saudi Arabia and the governments of Iraq and Jordan, rivals of Syria, warmed considerably to the protestations of the leftist current in Syria, which viewed the growing ties between the region's conservative monarchies with distress. After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets in Saudi Arabia and withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response to the crisis between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of some in the Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order to shut down the communist newspaper Al Sarkha. On 6 August, Quwatli established a long-term agreement with the USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of a large portion of Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al- Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attach√© from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria. Leftist influence in Syria grew further in the immediate wake of the crisis; on 15 August, a high-ranking officer from Sidon, Lebanon with Marxist leanings, Afif Bizri, was appointed army chief of staff, and several mid-level officers were replaced with communist officers. Quwatli flew to Egypt amid apparent plans to resign from the presidency in favor of the Soviet-leaning Azm. However, he returned to Syria on 26 August. Tensions had been rising as rumors swept the region regarding a US-backed Turkish or joint Iraqi-Jordanian invasion of Syria to prevent a potential communist takeover. Quwatli's earlier success in repairing ties between Syria and Saudi Arabia proved particularly useful during this period. Saud immediately lent his full support to Quwatli, whom he viewed as a significant counterweight to the leftist movement, by rebuffing President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appeal to endorse the Eisenhower Doctrine, a policy aimed at containing communist and Arab nationalist influence in the Middle East. He also accepted an invitation to Damascus by Quwatli on 25 August, publicly stating that Saudi Arabia would support Syria in any aggression against it. Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Jawdat also proclaimed support for Syria when he visited on 26 August, in spite of support for an attack by the Iraqi monarchy. Both Saud and Jawdat privately criticized Syria's leadership for increasing dependence on the Eastern bloc. Nonetheless, the US and its allies in the Baghdad Pact genuinely feared that Syria was becoming a satellite of the Soviets and decided in a September meeting that Quwatli's government had to be removed. That same month Turkish troops massed along the border with Syria. On 13 October, Nasser, who had launched a radio campaign denouncing the Baghdad Pact countries, dispatched 1,500 Egyptian troops, a mostly symbolic force, to the port of Latakia in northern Syria in a show of Arab strength against Turkey, to the acclaim of the Syrian and pan- Arab public. The leaders of Jordan and Iraq promptly reassured Quwatli that they had no intention to interfere in Syria's internal affairs. Nasser had apparently bypassed his ally Quwatli, coordinating the deployment with officers Sarraj and Bizri instead. Quwatli related this fact to Saud, who had complained of not being consulted of the Egyptian move beforehand, an \\"admission ... of Quwatli's political irrelevance,\\" according to contemporary historian Salim Yaqub. Sarraj and Bizri wielded substantial influence in Syrian politics, checking the power of the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister. =Unity with Egypt= Quwatli and Nasser at final meeting of Syrian-Egyptian unity talks in Cairo. Sabri al-Asali is behind Quwatli, Salah al-Din al-Bitar is the second to Nasser's left and Afif Bizri is to al-Bitar's left, February 1958 Amid the euphoria generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards the end of October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus in a gesture of solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence. In December, the Ba'ath Party composed a proposal entailing federal unity with Egypt, prompting their communist rivals to propose a total union. While the communists were less eager to merge with Egypt, they sought to appear before the Syrian public as the group most dedicated to unity, privately believing Nasser would reject the offer as he had the first time. According to historian Adeed Dawisha, \\"the communists ended up outmaneuvering themselves ... unprepared for the unfolding events spearheaded by a public driven to frenzy by all talk and promises of union.\\" On 11 January 1958, the communist chief-of-staff, Bizri, led an officers delegation to press for unity with Cairo without consulting Quwatli beforehand. Instead, the Egyptian ambassador, Mahmud Riad, met and notified Quwatli of Bizri's move. Quwatli was angered at the military's move, telling Riad that it amounted to a coup and Egypt was complicit. Quwatli clasps hands with Nasser before crowds of spectators in Damascus days after the United Arab Republic is established, March 1958 To assert his influence over the unity talks, Quwatli sent Foreign Minister al-Bitar to Cairo on 16 January to join the discussions. Nasser, while still hesitant at the Syrian proposal and discouraged by members of his inner circle, became increasingly concerned with the communists' power in Syria as testified by Bizri's leadership and autonomy from Quwatli. He was further pressured by the Arab nationalist members of the delegation, including al-Bitar, who alluded to an impending communist takeover and urgently appealed to him not to \\"abandon\\" Syria. Nasser ultimately agreed to the union, but insisted that it be formed strictly on his terms, stipulating a one-party system, a merged economy, and Syria's adoption of Egyptian social institutions; in effect a full-blown union. Syria's political leaders, particularly the communists, the Ba'athists and the conservatives, viewed Nasser's terms unfavorably, but nonetheless accepted them in response to mounting popular pressure. Quwatli left for Cairo in mid-February to conclude the agreement with Nasser and on 22 February the United Arab Republic (UAR) was established. Quwatli resigned from the presidency and Nasser became the president of the new union. To honor Quwatli for his gesture and his longtime struggle in the Arab nationalist cause, Nasser accorded him the title of \\"First Arab Citizen.\\" The announcement of the UAR was met with widespread jubilation and celebration throughout the Arab world, most prominently in Syria. Nasser arrived in Damascus on an unannounced visit on 24 February and went directly to Quwatli's home. According to al-Hawrani, as Nasser met with Quwatli, \\"a sea of colliding humanity gathered with astonishing speed\\" as residents left their workplaces and homes to meet the leaders at Quwatli's house. When the two decided to leave for the official guesthouse in an open- top automobile, it took them two hours to reach the destination, where it normally would have taken about five minutes. The commotion of the growing crowds surrounding the car caused Quwatli to nearly faint. Following the union's establishment, Quwatli retired from politics. Later life By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser and criticized his policies in Syria. In particular, he condemned the institution of land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government as part of the socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers. On 23 October, he made a televised speech condemning the UAR and expressing his disappointment with Nasser, saying \\"unity does not mean annexation and the presidential system does not mean the separation of the ruler from the ruled.\\" He also accused the Egyptian authorities of establishing a system of rule dependent on \\"1,001 spies\\" and responsible for sowing division in the republic. Quwatli told the Syrian people they controlled their own destiny, saying \\"Ranks and titles come and go, but you the people are immortal!\\" He concluded his speech with self- criticism, stating \\"I was able to serve your struggle as an ordinary citizen more than I was able to serve you when I was president.\\" The secessionist officers, pleased at Quwatli's statements, discussed whether or not to have Quwatli serve another term as president or to finish the term he began in 1955, which was cut about one year short as a result of the UAR's establishment. The proposal did not manifest, largely due to Quwatli's relatively old age at the time. On 8 March 1963 a coalition of unionist officers consisting of Ba'athists, Nasserists and independent Arab nationalists overthrew the secessionist government of President Nazim al-Qudsi and Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm. Quwatli left Syria shortly after and moved to Beirut, Lebanon.

Feeling a pain in his chest he was taken to a hospital on 29 June. He died in Beirut on 30 June.Mideast Mirror. 19. Arab News Agency. 1967. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba'athist-dominated government refused to allow Quwatli's body to be buried in Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July. Legacy On the day of his funeral, Radio Damascus called Quwatli \\"one of the sons of this homeland who has sacrificed and struggled for the advancement, liberation and unity of the Arab nation.\\" He was proclaimed a founding father of the Syrian Arab Republic. Historians and the Syrian population generally consider Quwatli to be one of the most \\"renowned Syrian leaders of the twentieth century,\\" according to Moubayed.

The coat of arms of Alcoutim - a wreath of zambujeiro (wild olive tree) and the slogan Aleo - is derived from the decorative motif of the tomb of Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real, found in the Igreja da Gra√ßa in Santar√©m. 'Aleu' or 'aleo' is an old Portuguese term for a 'gaming stick' (as used in hockey or shuffleboard). It refers to a famous episode concerning Pedro de Menezes from shortly after the Conquest of Ceuta on September 2, 1415 (commemorated on Ceuta Day). Pedro de Menezes was engaged in an outdoor game in the king's presence when a messenger arrived reporting an imminent Moroccan attack on Portuguese-held Ceuta. Menezes is said to have raised his gaming stick (aleo) and told the king that \\"with that stick alone\\" he could defend Ceuta from all the power of Morocco.\\"Eu s√≥ com este p√°u, sou capaz de defender Ceuta, de todo o poder dos mouros\\", as reported in Portugal antigo e moderno, 1878, p. 495.

He was the son of a man named Vardan.Ghazar Parpetsi, History of Armenia, 5th to 6th century Koryun, his pupil and biographer, tells us that Mashtots (in his work he does not mention the name Mesrop) received a good education, and was versed in the Greek and Persian languages. On account of his piety and learning Mesrop was appointed secretary to King Khosrov IV. His duty was to write in Greek and Persian characters the decrees and edicts of the sovereign. Leaving the court for the service of God, he took holy orders, and withdrew to a monastery with a few chosen companions. There, says Koryun, he practiced great austerities, enduring hunger and thirst, cold and poverty. He lived on vegetables, wore a hair shirt, slept upon the ground, and often spent whole nights in prayer and the study of the Holy Scriptures. This life he continued for a few years. Armenia, so long the battle-ground of Romans and Persians, lost its independence in 387, and was divided between the Byzantine Empire and Persia, about four-fifths being given to the latter. Western Armenia was governed by Byzantine generals, while an Armenian king ruled, but only as feudatory, over Persian Armenia. The Church was naturally influenced by these violent political changes, although the loss of civil independence and the partition of the land could not destroy its organization or subdue its spirit. Persecution only quickened it into greater activity, and had the effect of bringing the clergy, the nobles, and the common people closer together. The principal events of this period are the invention of the Armenian alphabet, the revision of the liturgy, the creation of an ecclesiastical and national literature, and the readjustment of hierarchical relations. Three men are prominently associated with this work: Mesrop, Patriarch Isaac, and King Vramshapuh, who succeeded his brother Khosrov IV in 389. In 394, with the help of blessing of Armenia's Catholicos, Sahak Partev, Mesrop set out on a mission of spreading the word of God to a pagan or semi-pagan people. Mesrop, as noted, had spent some time in a monastery preparing for a missionary life. With the support of Prince Shampith, he preached the Gospel in the district of Goghtn near the river Araxes, converting many heretics and pagans. However, he experienced great difficulty in instructing the people, for the Armenians had no alphabet of their own, instead using Greek, Persian, and Syriac scripts, none of which was well suited for representing the many complex sounds of their native tongue. Again, the Holy Scriptures and the liturgy, being written in Syriac, were, to a large extent, unintelligible to the faithful. Hence the constant need of translators and interpreters to explain the Word of God to the people. Mesrop, desirous to remedy this state of things, resolved to invent a national alphabet, in which undertaking Isaac and King Vramshapuh promised to assist him. It is hard to determine exactly what part Mesrop had in the fixing of the new alphabet. According to his Armenian biographers, he consulted Daniel, a bishop of Mesopotamia, and Rufinus, a monk of Samosata, on the matter. With their help and that of Isaac and the king, he was able to give a definite form to the alphabet, which he probably adapted from the Greek. Others, like Lenormant, think it derived from the Avestan. Mesrop's alphabet consisted of thirty-six letters; two more (long O and F) were added in the twelfth century. Medieval Armenian sources also claim that Mashtots invented the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets around the same time. However, most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia, a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli. The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III (326 or 337) and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of 430,Hewitt, p. 4 contemporaneously with the Armenian alphabet. The first sentence in Armenian written down by St. Mesrop after he invented the letters is said to be the opening line of Solomon‚Äôs Book of Proverbs: The Amaras Monastery in Artsakh, where Mesrop Mashtots established the first-ever Armenian school that used his script in the 5th century.Viviano, Frank. ‚ÄúThe Rebirth of Armenia,‚Äù National Geographic Magazine, March 2004 The invention of the alphabet in 405 was the beginning of Armenian literature, and proved a powerful factor in the upbuilding of the national spirit. \\"The result of the work of Isaac and Mesrop\\", says St. Martin,, V, 320. \\"was to separate for ever the Armenians from the other peoples of the East, to make of them a distinct nation, and to strengthen them in the Christian Faith by forbidding or rendering profane all the foreign alphabetic scripts which were employed for transcribing the books of the heathens and of the followers of Zoroaster. To Mesrop we owe the preservation of the language and literature of Armenia; but for his work, the people would have been absorbed by the Persians and Syrians, and would have disappeared like so many nations of the East\\". Anxious that others should profit by his discovery, and encouraged by the patriarch and the king, Mesrop founded numerous schools in different parts of the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. It is historically proven, that Saint Mesrop himself taught in Amaras monastery of Artskah region of Armenia (located in contemporary Martuni region of unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). But his activity was not confined to Eastern Armenia. Provided with letters from Isaac he went to Constantinople and obtained from the Emperor Theodosius the Younger permission to preach and teach in his Armenian possessions. Having returned to Eastern Armenia to report on his missions to the patriarch, his first thought was to provide a religious literature for his countrymen. Having gathered around him numerous disciples, he sent some to Edessa, Constantinople, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and other centres of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were John of Egheghiatz, Joseph of Baghin, Yeznik, Koryun, Moses of Chorene, and John Mandakuni. Verses of Mesrop Mashtots The first monument of this Armenian literature is the version of the Holy Scriptures. Isaac, says Moses of Chorene, made a translation of the Bible from the Syriac text about 411. This work must have been considered imperfect, for soon afterwards John of Egheghiatz and Joseph of Baghin were sent to Edessa to translate the Scriptures. They journeyed as far as Constantinople, and brought back with them authentic copies of the Greek text. With the help of other copies obtained from Alexandria the Bible was translated again from the Greek according to the text of the Septuagint and Origen's Hexapla. This version, now in use in the Armenian Church, was completed about 434. Gravesite of Mesrop Mashtots. The inventor of the Armenian alphabet. The decrees of the first three councils ‚Äî Nic√¶a, Constantinople, and Ephesus ‚Äî and the national liturgy (so far written in Syriac) were also translated into Armenian, the latter being revised on the liturgy of St. Basil, though retaining characteristics of its own. Many works of the Greek Fathers also passed into Armenian. The loss of the Greek originals has given some of these versions a special importance; thus, the second part of Eusebius's Chronicle, of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entirely in Armenian. In the midst of his literary labors Mesrop revisited the districts he had evangelized in his earlier years, and, after the death of Isaac in 440, looked after the spiritual administration of the patriarchate. He survived his friend and master by only six months. The Armenians read his name in the Canon of the Liturgy, and celebrate his memory on 19 February. Saint Mashtots is buried at a chapel in Oshakan, a historical village southwest from the town of Ashtarak. Saint Mesrop is listed officially in the Roman Martyrology of the Roman Catholic Church; his feast day is February 17. Legacy The statue of Mesrop Mashtots in front of Matenadaran, Yerevan Virtually every town in Armenia has a street named after Mashtots. In Yerevan, Mashtots Street is one of the most important in the city center, which was previously known as Lenin Street (Lenin Prospect). There is a statue to him at the Matenadaran, one at the church he was buried at in Oshakan village, and one at the monument to the alphabet found on the skirts of Mt. Aragats north of Ohanavan Village. Stamps have been issued with his image by both the Soviet Union and by post-Soviet Armenia. The Order of St. Mesrop Mashtots, established in 1993, is awarded for significant achievements in economic development of the Republic of Armenia or for accomplishments, such as in science, culture, education or public service, and for activities promoting those fields.
