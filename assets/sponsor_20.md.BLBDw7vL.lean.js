In 1977 he moved to Cawood, near York where he established a studio. Legacy In Lyon's Obituary in the Yorkshire Post, Peter Murray wrote: ‚ÄúHis drawings often portrayed a sensitive response to landscape which had a strong influence on his powerful sculptures, which looked at home in the landscape.‚Äù In an obituary in the Guardian he was described as: \\"...one of the group of artists who developed successful careers from a non-metropolitan base. Such strength of mind was the driving force that Michael and others, principally Peter Murray, engaged to create the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1977...so many young artists rushed off to London, and lost immediate connection with land and sky.

She was known for her researches into the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Life and career Klara Ashrafyan was born in Yerevan in the family of one of the founders of the Armenian Communist party, Zarmair Ashrafyan. In 1936, he and his wife were denounced, arrested and executed. The orphaned Klara was adopted by relatives in Moscow. Despite being tarnished as a family member of traitors to the Motherland, she was allowed to study at the Faculty of History, Moscow State University, where she graduated in 1947. She specialised in the history of medieval Iran under B.N. Zakhoder, obtaining her Candidate of Sciences degree in 1950 with a dissertation on the period of the rule of Nadir Shah. Between 1950‚Äì1955, she worked as an editor of the bulletin of foreign literature at the Fundamental Library of Social Sciences, succeeding Koka Antonova. Persuaded by Antonova and I.M. Reisner to change her field of study, she shifted to researching the Islamic states of medieval India, where her knowledge of Persian was useful. From 1955 to her death, she worked at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1984, the Institute decided to organise a multi-volume collective set of works on the History of the Orient. Ashrafyan was tasked with heading a section on the peoples of the east. She edited volumes II and III of the set. Ashrafyan died in Moscow on 7 August 1999. =Academics= Ashrafyan's first monograph, published in 1960, was titled The Delhi Sultanate, covering the political development and social and economic basis for the first Islamic dominions in North India. This was the first publication on the subject in the Soviet Union. Her investigations were chiefly into land ownership and the socio- economic structure of Indo-Muslim states. In keeping with Soviet philosophies of progressive evolution of the economy, she termed private land holdings in the 13th century as feudal tenure, replaced subsequently by the military organisation of the ruling class, leading to state ownership of land and the economic subjugation of the peasantry. She claimed that private ownership evolved slowly in India with the coercion of producers, such that before the British occupation of the country, prerequisites for production relations were already being established in the agricultural system of the country. Whereas some scholars claimed that the rise and fall of dominions in India were essentially manifestations of a static socio-economic structure, with state power changing hands and not facing any social conflicts or subaltern revolts, Ashrafyan contended that by the late medieval period, there were peasant uprisings against Mughal rule, chiefly caused by wealthy agriculturalists wanting a larger share of the revenue and power. Indeed, she posited two stages of feudalism, an early phase up to the 13th century and a developed phase up to the 18th. In the former, a hierarchical organisation of class established itself, with the peasantry and merchant class subjugated and a new elite lording over them. In the latter, popular movements churned society, upending the hierarchy to a degree. Still, she said, feudalism didn't evolve sufficiently towards the capitalist stage of development. This thesis was criticised as dubious, especially for the pan-Indian nature of the argument, whereas other researchers had shown that in the South, taxpayers were not necessarily peasants and in any case owned property. In her analysis of the change of socio-economic structures, Ashrafyan (in keeping with the Soviet school of Indian studies) took an anti-religious stance, suggesting that movements such as Bhakti and Sikhism diluted social reform with religious garb, and that Akbar's Din-i Ilahi was a state counter to reduce their energy.

The inscription is dated to 584 CE and was dedicated to Taspar Khagan (reigned 572-581) the fourth Khagan of the Turkic Khaganate. The inscription is in the form of a monumental wolf-crowned stele 198 cm high that sits on a turtle base 47 cm high. The front, right and left side of the stele has a Sogdian inscription written with Sogdian alphabet. The back side has a possibly Ruanruan inscription written with Brahmi script. The original location of the inscription on the west bank of the Bayantsagaan river, a tributary of the North Tamir river, shows evidence of a walled complex. The wall embankment is 59mx30m with an inner moat 4.5m wide and 2m deep. In the center of the walled complex was a temple whose wooden pillars and roof tiles were still visible on the ground. Only a few brick fragments were found. The inscription itself was found within the walls on a square platform 7.5mx7.5m made of layered stones. Historical context Turkic Khaganate at its greatest extent in 576 CE The stele was erected in 584 CE with a latest date of 587 CE. It is dedicated to Taspar Khagan who is also called Tatpar Khagan. By this time the Turkic Khaganate stretched from Manchuria to the Black Sea. It controlled the Silk Road while its imperial seat of power was in central Mongolia. The Turkic Khaganate replaced their previous overlords the Rouran Khaganate (also called Ruanruan) in 552 with the help of the Western Wei. The Turks proceeded to defeat the Hepthalite vassals of the Rouran in Uzbekistan with the help of the Sasanian Empire of Persia in 560. The defeat of the Rouran and Hephthalites and their pursuit by the Turks precipitated the migration of the Avars into Eastern Europe. Charlemagne would ultimately accept their surrender in 798 at Aachen and send one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of khagan. The Turks allied with the Byzantine Empire against the Sasanians. Byzantine envoy Zemarchus visited Istemi Khagan in the Altai Mountains (Golden Mountains) in 569. The Sogdian language of the inscriptions reflects the prominence of Sogdians on the Silk Road. Sogdians were East Iranians from Sogdia, one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire. The Mongolic Ruanruan inscription reflects the influence of the previous Rouran Khaganate. The title Khagan was first used by the Rourans who were an offshoot of the Xianbei similar to the Tuoba, Khitan, Tuyuhun and Shiwei (Mongols). Some Rouran nobility were Buddhists. The wolf at the top of the stele reflects the Turks' belief in their origin from a wolf like the Mongols. The vertical orientation of the inscriptions and the turtle base reflects cultural influence from China. The Inscription of H√ºis Tolgoi is another inscription found in Mongolia, dated to 604 to 620 CE, with a Brahmi Mongolic text.

Among the social priorities of the movement are the elimination of all tribal, family and sectarian affiliations, Instead of resorting to other protections, which are an urgent need for the human being when he lacks a legal-civilized incubator that protects him, and the pride of the citizen to his Syrian identity only. = Public policy = The pluralistic movement of society believes in social liberalism, mostly individual freedoms such as freedom of belief, freedom of thought and freedom of expression. It assumes that recognition of the other is a duty and not just the other right's, which is (movement) the first political organisation - intellectual - social raises the other's concept of recognition. The Movement believes that democratic- liberal societies are not the best forms of political systems but the best available among the world's prevailing regimes. Therefore, the Movement believes that some changes must be made to the democratic-civil system in Syrian society in proportion to this society's needs and necessities. The Movement believes in reconciling Syria with its geographical surroundings and good relations with neighboring countries. This vision stems from the fact that Syria's important geographic position is a point of contact between Asia and Africa with the two European countries.

Pretoria: Protea Boekhuis, 2016. Governor Zacharias Wagenaer was very concerned about providing regular drinking water to inhabitants and visiting ship crews alike. He ordered a rectangular masonry dam, known as the New Bowl (or also Wagener's Tank), to be built between the Fort and the ocean. Soldiers, gardeners, slaves, boys, and girls, essentially everyone in the settlement, worked to dig up and break the bedrock. Afterwards, masons finished the walls and sluices. After two months of work, the dam stretched 45 m long, 15 m wide, and 1¬Ω m deep, storing 700,000 L of water from the Fresh River. In 1671, Wouter Mostert built a canal from the dam to the wharf to make it easier for sailors to fill the barrels at the ships rather than rolling them down the dam and on board. The remains of the dam and canal have become a historical attraction as the Golden Acre.

The current bridge was originally built in 1768 to cross a different watercourse, and was rebuilt and opened in its present location in 1784. There has been a bridge on the site of the present crossing since the digging of the Winter Canal between 1718 and 1719. It was initially a wooden drawbridge design, and was replaced by a triple-span fixed wooden bridge in the mid-eighteenth century. This was in turn replaced in the 1780s by a single-span stone arched bridge, which had originally been built over the nearby Red Canal. This bridge, designed by Yury Felten and I. G. Rossi, with its construction supervised by engineer T. I. Nasonov, was rendered obsolete after the Red Canal was filled in in the late 1770s. The bridge was subsequently disassembled, moved to the Winter Canal, and reassembled there. It has remained in its new location ever since, undergoing various changes in its name, before its current name appeared in 1940. It was repaired in the 1950s, but has retained its architectural appearance from the eighteenth century, and has been designated an object of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance. Location and design The First Winter Bridge is in Dvortsovy Municipal Okrug, part of the Tsentralny District of the city. It carries Millionnaya Street across the Winter Canal close to the Winter Palace. It is a stone single-span arched bridge long and wide. Its abutments rest on a pile foundation, with its facades faced with granite. It has a solid granite parapet and pavements, with step descents to the canal embankment. Two descents from the embankment on the upstream side of the bridge provide access to the canal waters. It is one of three bridges that cross the Winter Canal, the others being Hermitage Bridge, at the canal's junction with the Neva, and , at the point the canal splits from the Moyka. History The Winter Canal began as a channel dug between 1718 and 1719, connecting the Neva and Moyka Rivers in the vicinity of the . A wooden lifting drawbridge was built spanning the canal at Bolshaya Nemetskaya Street, present day Millionnaya Street, between 1718 and 1720. It was rebuilt as a triple-span fixed bridge, again in wood, in the mid-eighteenth century. In 1768 a single-span stone arched bridge was built over the nearby Red Canal, which also connected the Neva and Moika, along the western edge of the Tsaritsyn Meadow, now the Field of Mars. This bridge, which carried Bolshaya Nemetskaya Street over the Red Canal, was designed by Yury Felten and I. G. Rossi, with its construction supervised by engineer T. I. Nasonov. The Red Canal was filled in by 1780, having become unnecessary, and occupying land wanted for construction. The stone bridge was dismantled between 1783 and 1784, taken piece by piece to the Winter Canal, and reassembled there, replacing the wooden bridge dating from 1768. The canal embankment was in the process of being faced in granite at this time. The bridge viewed from the canal, with the Hermitage Bridge beyond The wooden bridge in this location was initially called the German Bridge () from 20 April 1738, after Bolshaya Nemetskaya Street, meaning Great German Street. The name came from the large proportion of Germans who settled in the area, causing it to be termed the \\"German Settlement\\". The term German Bridge appears on maps, while the name \\"Bridge of the Old Winter Palace\\" () was also in common use. The street was later renamed Millionnaya, with the new stone bridge becoming Millionnaya Bridge. The name Transfiguration Bridge () appears on an 1828 map of the city, after the Preobrazhensky Regiment, who had their barracks close to the site of the bridge. From 1829 it was called the Winter Bridge, after the canal it crossed. With the construction of a new bridge across the canal in 1940 it has been called the First Winter Bridge, to distinguish it from the . In 1955 the bridge underwent repairs to its stone vaulting and roadway, by Lengiproinzhproekt, and overseen by engineer B. B. Levin. The bridge has preserved its architectural appearance unchanged since the 18th century, and has been designated an object of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance.

State students and alumni who gave their lives in the service of the nation. A prominent university symbol, the tower is a popular rallying point for the campus community. Design and features =Dimensions= The Belltower is constructed from 1,400 tons of granite quarried at Mount Airy, North Carolina, and rests on a 700-ton square concrete base with an area of 62 square feet, which includes the four sets of concrete steps on each side. The tower itself is 18 square feet at its base, tapering to 14 square feet at its top. =Exterior architecture= The tower shaft was designed with a combination of semi-Romanesque Revival features and Collegiate Gothic verticality by William Henry Deacy of the W.W. Leland Studios in New York City. At the top of the tower shaft are 12 carved torches, three on each side. The clock section and the top of the tower were designed in 1935-36 by the North Carolina State department of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and by the N.C. State College architectural department. The clock section consists of a four-faced granite clock wide by high. The bronze numerals on each clock face were cast by the N.C. State College foundry prior to the clock's actual installation. At each corner of the clock section are two tall carved American eagles, eight in all, which support the top of the tower. The top of the tower, including the open bell tower and bell platform, consists of fluted and carved Romanesque pillars and arches, with two pillars on each side. The bell platform is supported at each corner by four rectangular columns. On each face of each rectangular column is carved a full-length Roman battle sword, eight in all, with each sword hilt overlaid by a shield. The battle swords and shields represent war, while the American eagles represent the State College's role in World War I. =Plans for a carillon= Initial plans for the tower as designed in 1920 included a carillon of 10 bells to be installed following the shaft's completion, with the intention of gradually increasing the number of bells to 54. Those plans were retained when an updated set of blueprints were drawn up in 1935-36. The carillon was to be played by a carillonneur/carillonist from a chamber above the tower base. It was then thought the initial 10-chime carillon might be installed by 1939 given sufficient funds, but it was not until 1986 that a new carillon was dedicated in honor of university chancellor Carey Bostian and his wife Neita. History After World War I, Vance Sykes, a member of the N.C. State Class of 1907, wrote to college alumni secretary E.B. Owen concerning the building of a monument to honor N.C. State alumni who had been killed in the conflict. This was credited with inspiring a movement within the college community toward the monument's planning and construction. A five-person Memorial Committee was soon formed, headed by Carroll Lamb Mann (1877-1961), a graduate of the Class of 1899 and a professor of civil engineering, with E. B. Owen as secretary and treasurer. At a meeting of the N.C. State College Alumni Association of New York on October 3, 1919, a resolution was proposed and passed \\"that the N.C. State College Alumni Association of New York...suggest as a suitable memorial a clock tower permanently placed, thus obviating the blowing of the 'whistle' on the campus, [with] the clock to have a good loud striking bell and chimes, if the expense is not too great.\\" The Memorial Committee considered dozens of proposals before selecting that of the New York alumni chapter. On March 22, 1920, the Memorial Committee unanimously resolved to raise $30,000 ($289,000 in 2018 values) to erect a bell tower on the N.C. State campus as a lasting tribute to alumni \\"who gave their lives in the World War.\\" The committee estimated the tower would cost \\"in the neighborhood of $10,000,\\" ($96,500 in 2018 values) with the clock costing $2,400 and a set of chimes at around $1,500. As of May 1920, $7,000 had been pledged by college alumni toward the memorial fund, along with less than $6,000 in cash donations. William Henry Deacy of the W. W. Leland Studios in New York City was subsequently chosen as the architect. At the annual meeting of the Alumni Association following commencement in May, two of his proposed designs were presented for consideration, \\"Design A,\\" an stone and brick adaptation of a colonial church spire, and \\"Design B,\\" a tower in \\"semi-Romanesque style with Gothic treatment of the vertical lines...it is military in character and recalls very strongly the beautiful towers at West Point.\\" \\"Design B\\" was unanimously approved by the Alumni Association members. On November 9, 1920, Deacy visited the N.C. State campus and consulted with members of the Memorial Committee, by which time plans had been made to lay the tower foundation, with the cornerstone to be laid during the May 1922 commencement week. The final design was for a bell tower built from local granite and holding an initial carillon of 10 bells with the intention of eventually having a 54-chime carillon. After careful consideration, including soliciting inputs from faculty members and J.P. Pillsbury, the college landscape architect, a site for the tower was chosen to the west of Holladay Hall, \\"on the summit of the hill immediately east and on the axis of Pullen Hall.\\" The tower foundation, with a final area of 48 square feet, was completed by the May 1921 commencement, with the addition of steps on each side of the base increasing the dimensions of the base to 62 square feet. On May 30, 1921, the Alumni Association decided to build the first section of the tower to a height of , with subsequent construction based on the availability of funds. Ultimately, the Memorial Committee decided to build that year to the water table, a height of about . Though just over $19,000 in pledges had been received by then, with $8,000 collected, estimated project costs for completing the tower had risen to $75,000 ($849,000 in 2018 values). The cornerstone of the Memorial Belltower was laid on November 10, 1921 with Masonic rites conducted by the Grand Lodge of North Carolina. Oliver Max Gardner, a former lieutenant governor and future Governor of North Carolina, gave the formal address dedicating the memorial, with over 3,000 college students and alumni in attendance. The first section of the Belltower was completed the following month by the J.D. Sargent Granite Company of Mount Airy, North Carolina, at a cost of $13,900 ($157,000 in 2018 values). Following the completion of the tower foundation and base, construction stopped for over two years, though fundraising efforts continued. On March 6, 1924, with committee chairman Mann presiding, the Memorial Committee convened to discuss erecting the tower's second section, which would add a further in height. Despite some debate over whether to substitute cheaper Indiana limestone for granite, the committee unanimously voted to continue building the tower with Mount Airy granite, which Deacy also fully endorsed. Construction of the second tower section began in June, and was completed by September 1924. By early 1926, the Memorial Committee was able to build a further section of the tower, with construction entrusted to the J.E. Beaman Construction Company of Raleigh. Graduating classes continued to make pledges for finishing the tower project, though construction again stalled during the Great Depression. Finally, in 1934, the Memorial Committee decided to request federal funding to complete the tower, as it was feared the project would otherwise be delayed indefinitely. In October 1935, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) granted $37,000 ($543,000 in 2018 values) to finish the stonework and complete the remaining of the tower shaft. In addition, fundraising efforts had generated $40,000 in pledges. Construction of the tower resumed on April 7, 1936. The stonework was finished in 1937, with student honor societies and the Class of 1938 donating the clock, followed by the Class of 1939's donation of floodlights. The tower was finally dedicated on November 11, 1949, by which time costs had reached $150,000. Traditions =Lighting= The NCSU Bell Tower is lit with red lights after athletic victories and other university successes. The Belltower is illuminated with red floodlights on Memorial Day, Veterans Day, during spring and winter commencements, for the inauguration of the President of the University of North Carolina or for the installation of the Chancellor of NC State, and on the university's Founders Day, an annual day of remembrance honoring university founders and deceased members of the North Carolina State University community. It is also illuminated to celebrate certain academic and athletic achievements, including induction of N.C. State faculty into a National Academy, the awarding of a Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, National Medal or Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineering, or the awarding of a North Carolina Award or a Governor‚Äôs Award for Excellence, among other distinctions. For categories of athletic achievement, the tower is illuminated to celebrate Atlantic Coast Conference football, men‚Äôs basketball, women‚Äôs basketball or baseball (series win) victories, select postseason victories for football, men‚Äôs basketball, women‚Äôs basketball or baseball, ACC championship victories in any team sport, and for national championship victories for any team or individual sport. The tower can also be illuminated for any other celebration or commemoration at the discretion of the university chancellor. =Krispy Kreme Challenge= The 2008 Krispy Kreme Challenge finish in front of the Memorial Belltower Since 2004, the Belltower has been the start- and endpoint for the Krispy Kreme Challenge, in which Challenge participants must run a road course leading to a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shop, eat one dozen doughnuts, and complete the race in under 1 hour. There are also categories for casual participants, who may choose whether to eat some doughnuts or none. Notes References  External links  * Guide to the William J.

After finishing second in his only start as a two-year-old he won two minor races in the following year as well as running third in the Group 2 Darley Stakes. He improved as a four-year-old in 2016 winning the Festival Stakes and the Meld Stakes as well as finishing a close second in the Diomed Stakes. He emerged as performer of the highest class in 2017 when he took the Winter Derby Trial before recording Group 1 wins in the Jebel Hatta, Tattersalls Gold Cup and Irish Champion Stakes. Background Decorated Knight is a chestnut horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred and owned by Saleh Al Homaizi & Imad Al Sagar of the Newmarket-based Blue Diamond Stud. He was initially sent into training with Roger Varian at the Kremlin House stable in Newmarket. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Decorated Knight's dam Pearling showed little racing ability, failing to win in two starts but as a daughter of Storm Cat and the broodmare Mariah's Storm was a full-sister to both Giant's Causeway and to You'resothrilling, the dam of Gleneagles, Happily and Marvellous. As a five-year-old in December 2011, with the future Decorated Knight in utero, Pearling was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 1.3 million guineas by Tony Nerses on behalf of the Blue Diamond Stud. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Decorated Knight made his first and only start as a two-year-old in a maiden race over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September and started at odds of 11/2 in a seventeen-runner field. Ridden by Andrea Atzeni, who became his regular jockey, he kept on well in the final furlong to finish second, a length behind the winner Commemorative. =2015: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Decorated Knight started favourite for a ten-furlong maiden at Ripon Racecourse in April but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten by the 33/1 outsider Salieri's Massachusetts On 3 July the colt mas made 1/2 favourite for a four-runner maiden over one mile on good to soft ground at Haydock Park. Ridden as on his previous start by Graham Lee he overcame an obstructed run in the straight to win \\"cosily\\" by a length and a quarter from the filly Ella's Honour. Later that month he was assigned top weight of 133 pounds for a handicap race at Sandown Park in which he was ridden by Atzeni and won \\"readily\\" from six opponents at odds of 5/4. In autumn, Decorated Knight returned for two events at Newmarket Racecourse which saw him stepped up in class. On 25 September he finished third of the four runners in the Group 2 Joel Stakes, beaten five and a half lengths by the winner Time Test. Two weeks later he came home fourth behind the Brazilian gelding Energia Davos in the Group 3 Darley Stakes over nine furlongs. =2016: four-year-old season= Before the start of the 2016 season Decorated Knight moved to the stable of Roger Charlton at Beckhampton in Wiltshire although Atzeni maintained his position as regular jockey. On his first run for his new trainer the colt started at 7/1 for the Listed Paradise Stakes over the straight mile course at Ascot Racecourse in April and finished fourth behind GM Hopkins, Battle of Marathon and Arod. On 21 May Decorated Knight was moved up to ten furlongs for the Festival Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 4/1 co-favourite alongside Berkshire (Royal Lodge Stakes) and Master Carpenter (John Smith's Cup). After tracking the leaders he took the lead a furlong out and won by half a length from Educate despite hanging right in the final strides. When moved back up to Group 3 class for the Diomed Stakes at Epsom Racecourse two weeks later he was restrained by Atzeni towards the rear before producing a strong late run. He gained the lead from Custom Cut in the final strides but was caught on the line by Tullius and was beaten a short head in a three-way photo finish. On 14 July Decorated Knight was sent to Ireland for the Group 3 Meld Stakes over nine furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he was partnered by George Baker and went off the 9/4 second favourite behind the Royal Hunt Cup winner Portage. He raced towards the rear of the seven-runner field before making rapid progress in the straight and after taking the lead a furlong out he drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Portage. =2017: five-year-old season= Decorated Knight began his fourth campaign on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Lingfield Park in February when he started the 9/2 fourth choice in an eight-runner field for the Listed Winter Derby Trial. His more fancied opponents were Arab Spring (John Porter Stakes), Battalion (Churchill Stakes) and Grendisar (2016 Winter Derby). After racing close behind the leaders Decorated Knight moved up to challenge for the lead approaching the final furlong and got the better of a struggle with Arab Spring to win by a short head. The horse was the sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Group 1 Jebel Hatta over 1800 metres on turf at Meydan Racecourse on 4 March. He was made the 2/1 favourite in a twelve-runner field which included Muffri'Ha (2016 Darley Stakes), Ertijaal (Cape Derby), Promising Run (Al Rashidiya) and Earnshaw (Prix Thomas Bryon). After racing in mid-division, Decorated Knight produced a sustained run in the straight, caught the front-running Folkswood in the final strides and won by a neck. Three weeks later over the same course and distance, the horse started 15/2 third favourite for the Dubai Turf but never looked like winning and came home sixth of the thirteen runners behind the Japanese filly Vivlos. On his return to Europe Decorated Knight was sent to Ireland and started 7/2 favourite for the Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at the Curragh on 28 May. His seven opponents included Deauville (Belmont Derby), Somehow (Dahlia Stakes), Success Days (Royal Whip Stakes), Johannes Vermeer (Crit√©rium International) and Moonlight Magic (Meld Stakes). He raced just behind the leaders as Success Days set the pace before taking the lead a furlong out. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages and won by one and a quarter lengths from Somehow with a gap of two and a quarter lengths back to Deauville in third. Atzeni commented \\"It went very smoothly. We had a good position all the way and he travelled beautifully into the race. I was very confident it was going take a decent horse to beat him today. He got to the front easily enough. In the last 100 yards he got a bit lonely, but when the second horse came he went again. He's very brave, he's got a big heart and he's going the right way\\". On 21 June at Royal Ascot Decorated Knight contested the Prince of Wales's Stakes and went off at odds of 10/1 in an eight-runner field. He ran his usual race, tracking the leaders before making steady progress in the straight to finish second to Highland Reel with Ulysses in third. In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park 17 days later he briefly took the lead in the straight but was quickly overtaken and faded to come home sixth behind Ulysses. In August he started a 16/1 outsider for the International Stakes at York Racecourse and finished fifth behind Ulysses, Churchill, Barney Roy and Cliffs of Moher. On 9 September ran for the second time in Ireland and started at odds of 25/1 for the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. Churchill started favourite while the other eight runners included Eminent (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano), Cliffs of Moher, Zhukova (Man o' War Stakes), Poet's Word, Moonlight Magic, The Grey Gatsby and Success Days. Decorated Knight was restrained at the rear of the field and was still last of the twelve runners entering the straight but then produced a strong run on the outside, gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Poet's Word. Charlton commented \\"He's tough, consistent, and very sound. He produced an amazing turn of foot and ran right to the line... He's been a bit unlucky in his last couple of races. He hated the ground at York, got bashed about at Sandown in the Eclipse, and ran a great race at Royal Ascot. He's been on the go since March, and he's improved and improved. To keep going all season is a tribute to the horse\\". For his final racecourse appearance, Decorated Knight was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Del Mar Racetrack on 4 November. Racing over a distance of one and a half miles for the first time he finished tenth of the twelve runners, just over seven lengths behind the winner Talismanic. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Decorated Knight was given a rating of 120, making him the 40th best racehorse in the world. Stud record Decorated Knight was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Irish National Stud. Pedigree *Decorated Knight was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The single was released on July 3, 2019 through Sony Music as the first song of her two-side single collection Fucking Money Man (2019). \\"Milion√†ria\\" is the first song that the singer has released in Catalan. The song was written by Rosal√≠a and her habitual collaborator and friend El Guincho, who also produced the song. A music video, directed by B√†rbara Farr√©, accompanied its release the same day. It reached number one in Spain, becoming her fourth number-one song and third consecutive number-one following \\"Con altura\\" and \\"Aute Cuture\\".  Background  Rosal√≠a began writing the song in February 2019 at the Seville Airport right after the 2019 Goya Awards. She finished the song in the studio after she arrived in Barcelona. Rosalia first teased the release of the song by using two emojis on Twitter, before announcing the release of her two-track EP Fucking Money Man (on which the song is included) in the Spanish press twelve hours before its official release. The singer also posted the announcement on her social media profiles. \\"Milion√†ria\\" was released at 6pm (Central European Time). The song talks about how she dreamed about being a millionaire when she was younger thanks to her music. \\"Dios Nos Libre del Dinero\\" contrasts the message of \\"Milion√†ria\\" by talking about how money cannot buy everything.  Critical reception  Almost all of the reviews \\"Milion√†ria\\" received from the international press were positive and praising the singer for singing in her native language, Catalan, despite its relative low profile and recognition worldwide. A Rolling Stone review, titled \\"Rosalia swims in money and sings in Catalan,\\" saw Suzy Exposito opine: \\"If we've learned anything from Rosal√≠a this year, it's that she's not afraid to take chances. [...] Now [...] the international pop heroine briskly sings not in Spanish, but in Catalan ‚Äî the language native to her home of Barcelona.\\" Pitchfork named \\"Milion√†ria\\" as a best new song and said that her two new tracks \\"return the Spanish singer to her brand sui generis of postmodern flamenco\\".  Commercial performance  \\"Milion√†ria\\" debuted in the fourth position of the Spanish Apple Music chart where a couple hours after climbed to the top position. Spanish online music magazine Vinilo Negro reported that \\"Rosal√≠a will debut in the next list of songs in Spain with only 30 hours of counting with \\"Milion√†ria\\". The song premiered last Wednesday at 6:00 p.m., with which it only had those 6 hours on Wednesday, in addition to Thursday, but they will be enough to debut on the Spanish list, and will not do so in very low positions.\\" The magazine also reported that \\"It would be the first time in the era of streaming that a song with no time debuts on the list. The second song \\"Dios Nos Libre del Dinero\\" could have options as well, although most likely it will not debut until the following week. Next week Milion√†ria could become the singer's number one song in Spain. The song debuted at 51 on the PROMUSICAE chart with only two days of tracking before ascending to number one.  Music video  The music video for \\"Milion√†ria\\" was released the same day as the song. The video is a doble-feature with the song's B-side \\"Dios Nos Libre del Dinero\\". It shows Rosalia participating in a TV show where she is about to become a millionaire. The singer said that the video, which was directed by Catalan artist T√†mara Farr√©, was inspired by the \\"TV contests that she usually sees with her grandmother\\".

It was released on Netflix on October 25, 2019. Plot Katrina's daughter, Clara has been bitten by a rattlesnake where Katrina meets a mysterious woman in a trailer who says she'll help. The bite appears to have vanished and when Katrina takes Clara to the hospital, it seems that everything is fine. The doctor suggests it was just a hallucination. A mysterious man visits Katrina at the hospital to talk about her \\"payment\\" for Clara's recovery, declaring her soul was spared and must be repaid; the only conditions being that the soul Katrina takes must be human, and it must be paid on time. He gives her until sunset to repay the debt, otherwise Clara will die from the rattlesnake bite. Katrina doesn't initially believe it, but when she goes back to the desert road, the trailer has disappeared and she sees a trucker with a missing eye, warning that Clara is going to die. Katrina discovers that the city of Tulia, Texas where she's ended up has been linked to a series of brutal murders and mysterious disappearances. Any time there's a photo or video of the crime scene, there's a mysterious shadowy figure in the background. The guy who visited her at the hospital is actually a lawyer who was fatally stabbed by a school teacher with the teacher saying \\"a soul for a soul\\" as he stabbed the lawyer, while a creepy kid who spooks Katrina actually went missing back in 2010. After an aborted attempt to kill a dying old man in the hospital, Katrina sets her sights on Billy, an abusive boyfriend she sees criticising his girlfriend in a bar. She breaks into their home and forces Billy to drive to a remote canyon in the desert. Before Katrina can kill him, though, he fights back and runs away. With time running out before sunset, Katrina prepares to kill herself, but as she films a goodbye message to Clara, Billy hits her with a rock and she blacks out. She wakes up just in time and when Billy is bitten by a rattlesnake, Katrina takes the opportunity to kill him to save her daughter. As she's watched over by mysterious figures on top of the canyon, Katrina leaves the canyon and on the way home, the doctor calls to say Clara is fine. When Katrina reunites with her daughter, she sees that Clara has drawn a picture of the mysterious figure and the sun, seemingly aware of what her mother had to do. And when the pair get back on the road, Clara spots a hitchhiker by the road, who Katrina sees is actually Billy.

The film is based on the murders, torture and extortion committed in Kyushu, Japan from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s by convicted serial killer Futoshi Matsunaga. It premiered on October 11, 2019 on Netflix. An extended cut 7-episode limited series version, titled The Forest of Love: Deep Cut is also released. The film and series stars Kippei Shiina, Kyoko Hinami and Shinnosuke Mitsushima.  Plot  Joe Murata (Kippei Shiina) sits in a restaurant as the misdeeds of a serial killer are reported on TV. Murata carries a yearbook from a girls' school, with numerous photos crossed out. He tells the waiter he's a screenwriter and asks if he knows what it's like to kill someone. Two young men, Jay and Fukami, meet another young man, Shin, and take him to the vacant warehouse where they're living. Jay says he wants to make movies to explore all kinds of criminal behavior legally. When Shin reveals he's a virgin, Jay takes him to meet a promiscuous girl. The girl, Taeko, refuses Shin but introduces him to her high school classmate, Mitsuko, a shut-in with well-off but strict parents. Mitsuko says she is also a virgin but isn't interested in Shin. Taeko argues she should \\"make some scars and move on\\". When Mitsuko and Taeko were in high school, their class worked on a production of Romeo and Juliet for the school festival. Mitsuko was to play Juliet, with Eiko as Romeo. With little experience with boys at their all-girls school, they explore sexuality and romance among themselves. Eiko is killed in a car accident, and the play is cancelled. Five of the girls decide to take sleep medication and stand on the edge of the school roof. Taeko vows to become a \\"slut\\" if she survives. Mitsuko sees a vision of Eiko and does not fall, while the others fall. Taeko lands on a parked car and is left with a limp and a scar. She gets \\"Romeo\\" tattooed on the scar. In the present, Mitsuko receives a call from Murata, who claims she had lent him 50 yen years ago. He claims he is now successful and wants to return the money. They meet at a park, where Murata arrives in a sports car and expresses attraction to her. Shin, Jay, and Fukami watch and record this. Mitsuko watches the video with Taeko and says she recognizes Murata as a con artist who had claimed to want to marry her sister. Taeko recalls sleeping with Murata and seeing him seduce her mother. The young men obtain a filming crew and begin making a film about Murata's cons, with Shin as Murata. Meanwhile, Murata seduces Mitsuko, her younger sister, Ami, and Taeko. He stages a concert, where many of his former victims show up to compete for his affections. The three filmmakers, Mitsuko, and Taeko meet up with him afterwards. Mitsuko reveals she is sleeping with Murata and shows them the burns and scars he left on her. Murata lifts Taeko's shirt to reveal more of the same. Murata says he can help with their movie, as he is wealthy. Fukami quits and leaves. The others accept. It is revealed Murata has no money. The film crew quits, leaving Jay, Shin, Taeko, and Mitsuko on the project. Murata takes over the film and revels in cruelty to them. Mitsuko says she is pregnant with his child. Murata takes them to a country house and coaches Mitsuko in a scene where she strangles Jay. Jay dies. Murata convinces them to destroy and dump Jay's remains in the lake. Taeko jumps from the boat to escape but is killed by an unknown gunman. They go to Mitsuko's home, where Murata uses Mitsuko's involvement in Jay's death to blackmail her parents, torturing them on camera. He tells them to get a relative to fund the film. Ami enjoys his torture of her parents and Mitsuko. Mitsuko attempts suicide after watching Ami have sex with Murata. Murata, Ami, and Shin decide \\"tomorrow will be Mitsuko's death scene\\". Mitsuko and Ami go dress shopping for the scene, and Ami thwarts her attempt to escape. Mitsuko has a miscarriage and is hospitalized. The relative discovers the film company is a sham and arrives to demand his money back. Inside the house, he encounters Mitsuko's drunk, raving parents. Murata and Shin return to find Mitsuko's father has hung himself. Her mother and relative lie on the floor with a bloody knife nearby. Ami returns home to find Murata and Shin have dismembered the relative. She decapitates her father and discovers her mother is alive. At her mother's request, Ami kills her. Murata, Shin, and Ami take Mitsuko to a forest, where she agrees to be killed. She explains she had not taken the sleep medication and had hoped Taeko would die, that she had sex with her friends' boyfriends as well as Ami's. She had known Murata was a con artist and Shin was a killer but hoped they would kill Ami, her parents, and Taeko. Shin shoots Ami and Mitsuko, then gives the gun to Murata and orders him to kill Ami, who is begging Murata for her life. Shin berates Murata then kills Ami himself. He reveals himself to be the serial killer reported on the news. They fight, and Murata escapes and waves down a car driven by a woman who resembles Eiko. When asked where she is heading, she answers, \\"To hell.\\" Shin takes the car they came in and gives a lift to a woman with car troubles. He sees Eiko by the side of the road, stops, and runs into the forest after her. On-screen text states that those behind the murders that inspired the film were caught in 2002 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

IFM Therapeutics launched in 2015 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, based on seed funding from the Boston-based venture capital fund Atlas Venture. The company's founding involved seven people, a mix of executives and university professors. Series A financing was provided by Atlas, London-based Abingworth, and Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. The company was originally formed with a dual development path, focusing on both autoimmune diseases and cancer immunotherapy. However, in 2017, the entire development program devoted to enhancing the body's innate immune response to cancer was purchased by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which set up a new company from this purchase and recruited IFM's CEO, Gary Glick, to head the new company. This purchase was notable in both its speed following IFM's establishment, and the payment‚Äîten-times the Series A funding injection. The following year, in 2018, Boston-based IFM Tre formed with the spin-out of research and assets specifically related to blocking the NLRP3 complex, a so- called inflammasome. This spin-out, described as a subsidiary, subsequently secured funding from a familiar set of sources: Atlas, Abingworth, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The rest of the company remained as a limited-liability company, from which it was anticipated further research spin-outs might take place. IFM Tre's leadership included Gary Glick and H. Martin Seidel, formerly of Novartis. An alternative view on the 2018, purchase by Bristol-Myers Squibb has characterized it as a straightforward acquisition of IFM, with remaining assets going to form IFM Therapeutics, which spawned two susidiaries, IFM Tre and IFM Due, the latter focused on development of cGAS/STING antagonists. IFM Tre was subsequently bought by Novartis in 2019.  Governance  Gary Glick was tapped to be the company's chief executive officer during its initial formaiton. Glick founded a spin-out immunotherapy firm from the University of Michigan in 2006, Lycera, and served as the company's chief scientific officer until joining IFM. Two other C-suite members at the outset were Dennis Dean, chief development officer, formerly of Vertex; and Shomir Gosh, chief scientific officer, formerly of Tempero Pharmaceuticals. Gosh left IFM in 2018 for the post of chief scientific officer at the Harvard spin-out firm 28-7 Therapeutics. In 2017, Martin Seidel joined IFM as the head of R&D;, coming from an executive position at Novartis. IFM's chairman was also an Atlas partner, Jean-Fran√ßois Formela, and an additional board member, Vincent Miles, came from Abingworth, the other major venture capital firm supporting IFM.

While Alfonso used the title Emperor of All Spain from at least 1077, the evidence for the adoption of a specific title referring to Christianity and Islam after 1085 is late and scholars are divided on its reliability. The title refers to Alfonso's position as paramount ruler in Spain in 1085‚Äì86. He directly ruled over the Christian kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile, including the ancient Visigothic capital of Toledo, and also extracted tribute (parias) from the petty Muslim kingdoms (·π≠awƒÅ æif) of al-Andalus. KitƒÅb al-iktifƒÅ æ The title appears for the first time in an Arabic source after Alfonso's death. The KitƒÅb al-iktifƒÅ æ of Ibn al-Kardab≈´s, written in the twelfth century, records that Alfonso \\"called himself Emperor, which in their language means Amƒ´r al-Mu æminƒ´n [Prince of the Faithful], and in the letters which he issued he wrote 'from the Emperor of the two religions'.\\"Mackay and Benaboud 1979. The KitƒÅb also quotes Alfonso pouring contempt on the titles used by the rulers of the petty kingdoms (·π≠awƒÅ æif, sing. ·π≠ƒÅ æifa) of Spain during an audience given to the ambassador of al-Mu øtamid, the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa ruler of Seville. The KitƒÅb does not, however, quote from any actual letter of Alfonso in which he uses the title \\"Emperor of the Two Religions\\". Al-·∏§ulal al-mawshƒ´ya Two actual letters of Alfonso containing variants of the title were copied into the anonymous 14th-century Arabic chronicle Al-·∏§ulal al-mawshƒ´ya, which was written by a Spanish Muslim. The authenticity of these letters has been a subject of debate. The first letter was addressed to al-Mu øtamid of Seville after the fall of Toledo on 6 May 1085. In the letter Alfonso demands that al-Mu øtamid hand over his domain to a governor of Alfonso's choosing, √Ålvar F√°√±ez. √Ålvar is known to have rejoined Alfonso's court only in February 1085 after spending time in voluntary exile with Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar (El Cid). The specific form of the title as it appears in this letter is \\"the emperor, lord of the two faiths, the most excellent ruler\\".Mackay and Benaboud 1984. Al-Mu øtamid's letter of reply is also included in the ·∏§ulal. He rejects Alfonso's demands and also objects to his arrogation of new titles: \\"with respect to the first point where you have begun to proclaim yourself lord of the two religions, the Muslims are worthier of this title, because your power and religion do not match what they have conquered of the regions of the land or the greatness of their military power\\". The ·∏§ulal, which is a strongly pro-Almoravid text, portrays al-Mu øtamid's subsequent request to the Almoravids for assist as a direct response to Alfonso's new demands and titles. The second letter of Alfonso was addressed to the Almoravid leader Y≈´suf ibn TƒÅshufƒ´n in Morocco. It was after the fall of Toledo but before Y≈´suf's victory over Alfonso at the Battle of Sagrajas on 23 October 1086. A version of this letter is also included in the Egyptian stylebook KitƒÅb ·∏§usn al-Tawassul ila ·π¢inƒÅ øat al- Tarassul of al-·∏§alabƒ´ (died 1325).Mackay and Benaboud 1978. In the ·∏§ulal version of the letter, Alfonso uses the title \\"the commander of the two faiths\\". In the stylebook's version, the title does not appear, but Alfonso writes, \\"my authority will be imposed on you and I will be entitled to sovereignty over the two religions and to rule over them\\". Al-·∏§alabƒ´ identifies the scribe of the letter as a Mozarab named Ibn al-FakhkhƒÅr, probably a Mozarab collaborationist from Toledo. Norman Roth, although arguing that the letter to Y≈´suf is a fabrication, suggests that al-·∏§alabƒ´'s Mozarabic scribe is in fact based on the historical Jewish family Ibn al-FakhkhƒÅr, which is known to have served Alfonso VIII and possibly Alfonso VI as diplomats.Roth 1985. The authenticity of the letters was accepted by Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Luis Garc√≠a de Valdeavellano and the Egyptian scholar Mu·∏•ammad  øAbd AllƒÅh  øInƒÅn. It was argued for in a series of papers by Angus Mackay and Mu·∏•ammad Benaboud. On the other hand, Ambrosio Huici Miranda lumped them with other \\"fabricated official letters\\", a conclusion also reached by Bernard Reilly.Reilly 1988, 181 n. 74. Roth strongly objects to their authenticity, arguing that fabricated letters between enemies were common in late medieval Islamic historiography.Roth 1984. If authentic, the letters must have been originally written in Arabic. In their analysis of Alfonso's use of imperial titles, Mackay and Benaboud see them as directed primarily at the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa kingdoms and not beyond the peninsula. They write, \\"[Alfonso] rejected the pretensions of the Taifa rulers while at the same time claiming a title that debarred Muslim claims from outside the peninsula... [He] did not claim a title over all Muslims, wherever they might be, but over Muslims and Christians within Hispania\\". Strictly, the Arabic term dh≈´-l-Millatayn, means \\"the adherents of two religions\\" and refers more to two communities than to two religions or faiths per se. Latin charters No known Latin letter or any other document issued by Alfonso uses a title like \\"Emperor of the Two Religions\\". The closest is imperator constitutus super omnes Hispaniae nationes (\\"emperor established over all the nations of Spain\\") from a charter of 1087, which links his imperial title to the different peoples under him. H√©l√®ne Sirantoine suggests that the Arabic sources are in effect translating this title so as to indicate clearly Alfonso's claim to rule over Muslims, which was unacceptable to them. A Latin title similar to \\"Emperor of the Two Religions\\" is, however, found in the dating clauses of a pair of private charters from Sahag√∫n dated to 1098 and 1104: regnante rex domno Adefonso in Toleto et imperante christianorum quam et paganorum omnia Hispanie regna (\\"the lord king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and commanding all the kingdoms of Spain both of the Christians and of the pagans\\").Men√©ndez Pidal 1950, 21.

Her family were part of the German-speaking community of the Kingdom of Hungary. Because of her father's death during her infancy, Zay's education was interrupted by periods where she taught to earn money in order to continue private and formal studies. In 1880 after studying abroad in Vienna and Gotha, she passed her primary education certification for Germany and Hungary. The following year, she was certified as a secondary teacher, becoming the first Transylvanian woman to have earned a higher education. From 1875 to 1884, she taught at the Institute of Irma Kem√©ndy in Szeged. After almost a decade in Szeged, Zay accepted a post at a newly established normal school for training kindergarten teachers in Kronstadt (Brass√≥). Though ostensibly a teacher, from the beginning Zay was the creative force behind the development of the school and designed the syllabus. She led the school from 1884 to 1927, becoming its official director in 1922. Simultaneously with her relocation to Kronstadt, Zay joined the General Women's Association of the Transylvanian Evangelical Church and became one of the leaders in pressing for women's rights. She successfully agitated for kindergarten and handicraft teachers to be recognized as educators and entitled to pensions. She lobbied for the teaching profession to be opened to women, which was accomplished in 1901, and for a women's normal school to be established, which occurred in 1903. Zay wrote books on the theory of child education which were distributed throughout Hungary and Germany and used as training texts until World War II. Having made contact during her studies abroad with international feminists, Zay pressed for women to be given the right to vote. In 1918, her campaign resulted in women gaining the ability to vote in church elections. She founded the Freie S√§chsische Frauenbund (Free Saxon Women's League) in 1920 as an umbrella organization to help women agitate for socio-political rights from the Kingdom of Romania, under whose jurisdiction Transylvania fell after the conclusion of World War I. In the 1920s, she served as a member of parliament and a member of the District Committee for the People's Council of Burzenland. She remained active in educational and political movements until her death in 1928. Early life 19th century Principality of Transylvania Adele Zay was born on leap day 1848 in Hermannstadt, in the Principality of Transylvania, Austrian Empire (today Sibiu, Romania) to Rosa (n√©e Graef) and Daniel Adolf Zay. Her family was Transylvanian-Saxon, part of the ethnically-German, Lutheran population which had been invited by the Hungarian king to settle in Transylvania from the 12th century. The German communities in which they lived maintained political autonomy from the 17th to the last quarter of the 19th century. She was the fourth daughter in the family and had a younger brother, , who would become a lawyer and Hungarian parliamentarian. Her father was High Court Judge for the regional court, but he died shortly after Adolf's birth in 1850. He left his wife only a small pension, which was inadequate for educating her children. Zay, who aspired to become a teacher, attended the Protestant girls' school and supplemented her education with private lessons in languages and natural sciences. Career =Early career (1865‚Äì1884)= By the age of 17, Zay had begun tutoring and within three years was teaching French and German at the M√§dchenerziehungsanstalt von Philippine Barreaud (Philippine Barreaud Girls' Educational Institute) in Hermannstadt. When the school closed in 1873, she moved to the Cotroceni neighborhood of Bucharest and taught at the M√§dchenerziehungs- und Lehrerinnenbildungsanstalt Asyl Helene (Helena Asylum Girls' Educational and Teacher Training Institute), where one of her older sisters was employed as a teacher. The Helena Asylum was an orphanage established in 1862 by Elena Cuza, the princess consort of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. It was later operated under the patronage of Queen Elisabeth of Wied. Zay taught classes in German language, geography, and history. Dugonics Square, Szeged, Hungary, circa 1883‚Äì1885 (top left building on the square with a horse in front is the Institute of Irma Kem√©ndy) In 1875, wanting to further her education, Zay went to Vienna and took a training seminar with Friedrich Dittes, a school reformer and advocate of the Fr√∂bel method. She also undertook private lessons in Gotha with August K√∂hler, an adherent of Fr√∂bel's principals who instructed her in pedagogy. By December, Zay had secured a new post, teaching English and German languages, geography and mathematics at the Institute of Irma Kem√©ndy in Szeged. While teaching, Zay continued her own studies at the Kem√©ndy Institute's normal school. In 1880, she passed the examination to teach in German and Hungarian state elementary schools. The following year, she passed an additional exam at the Budapest Public Normal School to teach French and English, becoming the first Transylvanian-Saxon teacher certified to teach secondary education. She continued teaching and worked as an administrator at the Kem√©ndy Institute until 1884, when the presbyterium of the Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession invited her to teach in their newly established normal school for training kindergarten teachers. =Kronstad (1884‚Äì1917)= After almost a decade in Szeged, Zay accepted the post at the Kinderg√§rtnerinnenbildungsanstalt von der Evangelischen Landeskirche-AB (KBA- AB) (Kindergarten Teachers Training College of the Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession) and moved to Kronstadt (Brass√≥). Though appointed as a classroom teacher under the headmaster, from the beginning Zay was the driving force and creative leader of the institution. As the only woman with a degree in higher education, she was entrusted with creating the syllabus, which included classes in educational and kindergarten theory, German and Hungarian languages, geography, history, and a practicum. Having been exposed to the women's movement during her studies in Germany over the previous decade, Zay joined the General Women's Association of the Transylvanian Evangelical Church upon its founding in 1884 and became one of the leaders in pressing for women's rights. In 1888, she presented a lecture Die Frau als Lehrerin (The Woman as Teacher) arguing that equal rights should be employed in the girls' schools operated by the Transylvanian Evangelical Church. She pointed out that in 1887 a proposal for hiring women teachers had been rejected based on the rationale that the Church would have to open and operate a normal school to train them. Die Frau als Lehrerin, 1889 At the 1889 National Exhibition for Infant Education in Budapest, Zay was honored with a citation for her work while the courses she taught at the school won the gold prize. Also that year, the KBA-AB curriculum was approved by the Hungarian crown and by 1891 her work and changes in the government requirements had transformed early education in Hungary. In 1892, the school was officially accredited by the state and two years later Zay designed a three-month long continuing education course to prepare caretakers for rural children, while their parents were engaged in planting and harvesting. The social work done by these caretakers, who focused on teaching children their native language and customs, built bridges between rural families and the towns where the caretakers lived. Also in 1894, she successfully appealed to the church authorities, arguing that kindergarten and handicraft teachers, who taught technical skill and helped preserve folk art but were not considered educators, should qualify for retirement pensions. In 1896, Zay published Theorie und Praxis der Kleinkindererziehung (Theory and Practice of Infant Education), a textbook which expressed the importance of the kindergarten in children's social development. She instructed teachers to allow children to learn from supervised activity and observation, noting that playing with each other stimulated their development as members of their community. Revised and republished under the title Theorie und Praxis des Kindergartens (Theory and Practice of the Kindergarten) in 1916, the book was widely used in Germany to train teachers until the advent of World War II. In 1898, Zay published a second book, Hilfsb√ºchlein zur Heranbildung von Leiterinnen von Sommerbewahranstalten (Help Booklet for the Further Education of Women Leading Summer Shelters), giving practical advice for teachers to organize summer activities for children to continue their socialization. A second edition was issued in 1918. After numerous petitions to the authorities, in 1901 Zay was finally successful in her push to open the teaching profession to women. A further success occurred when the first Transylvanian normal school for women opened in 1903 in Sch√§√üburg (Segesv√°r). Having used her summers to further her own education in England, France, and Germany, Zay made contact with international feminists, like Minna Cauer and Jeanette Schwerin. She began to agitate for changes in child labor laws, called for the suppression of national rhetoric in publications and speeches, and championed the cause of equality, including suffrage for women. =Later career (1918‚Äì1928)= In the aftermath of World War I, and the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War, the Kingdom of Romania gained jurisdiction over Transylvania. In 1918, women gained the right to vote in church elections and in 1920, Zay founded the Freie S√§chsische Frauenbund (Free Saxon [i.e. German- speaking] Women's League). The umbrella organization aimed to unite ethnically-German women's groups for socio-political action within the Romanian state. Through the group, she continued to press for women's education, calling for secondary technical education for girls and introducing up-bringing and nursery-care courses at girls' high schools. Elected as a member of parliament in 1920, Zay also served as a member of the District Committee for the People's Council of Burzenland. She was officially named director of the KBA-AB in 1922, holding the post until she retired in 1927. In her 43-year tenure, she had succeeded in graduating over 830 students. In 1924, Zay implemented changes to incorporate the new cultural policies required by the Romanian state, and the following year she was elected President of the Women's League. For her 80th birthday in 1928, the league organized a national fundraiser, collecting over 250,000 Romanian lei to establish the Adele Zay Foundation for the Preservation of Saxon Kindergartens. Death and legacy Biserica Neagra (Black Church), Brasov, Romania Zay died on 29 December 1928 in Kronstadt, following a short illness caused by a heart attack. She was the first woman to lie in state at the Black Church there, before being buried according to her wishes at the Hermannstadt Town Cemetery. She is remembered for her contributions to professionalize teaching, for establishing kindergartens in Transylvania based upon Fr√∂bel's principles, and for her efforts to empower women. In 1929, the KBA-AB was renamed as the \\"Adele Zay School\\", but was dissolved by the Romanian government in 1949. The Free Saxon Women's League, founded by Zay, was renamed the German-Saxon Federation of Women in 1930. In , Germany, a benevolent association which bears her name was founded in 1962. The association created the Haus Siebenb√ºrgen, Alten- und Pflegeheim (Transylvania House, Old People's Home and Treatment Center) in 1966 to care for elderly Transylvanians, erecting a bust and plaque honoring Zay in the foyer. The association also established a kindergarten in 1992 and a second kindergarten in 1995, both administered by the City of Wiehl.

Biography  He studied humanities and then Law at the University of Oviedo and moved to Madrid, where he became a magistrate.  Early career  At thirty he was appointed treasurer-general of the Kingdom by Manuel Godoy, a position that, after some time he resigned from, considering his work incompatible with the liberal convictions he professed. Though he retired to Pola de Somiedo, the General Board of the Principality named him its attorney general in 1798. When the uprising of Asturias against Napoleon took place in 1808, he sensed that \\"the fight against the invader does not make sense unless it is at the same time a political revolution\\", drafted the Proclamation of the Junta and also the Charter of the latter asking help from the King of England. When the Meeting was dissolved by the Marquis of La Romana, Fl√≥rez Estrada escaped to Seville to denounce what happened at the Central Board. He lived in Seville and C√°diz; drafted a draft of a liberal, albeit monarchical, Constitution. He left for London, and there he presented his ideology in the 1810 publications on the Introduction to the History of the Revolution in Spain and on the impartial Examination of the Dissensions of America with Spain. In 1812 he was deputy of the Cortes de C√°diz. In C√°diz he founded a liberal newspaper, and in 1813 he was appointed Military Intendant in Andalusia. Soon after, he left his post and devoted himself to the study of history, languages and economics.  Later career  His participation in the Cortes of C√°diz and Masonic societies forced him to flee Spain when, in 1814, he returned from Fernando VII threatening to condemn him to death, exiling himself in London. His stay there allowed him to get in touch with English economists (David Ricardo, James Mill and Adam Smith), introducing their ideas in Spain. He also went to Rome to offer Charles IV restitution on the throne if he accepted a constitutional monarchy. In 1818 he wrote a transcendental representation to the king in defense of the Cortes, which was printed in London in 1819 and which, published in Spain, contributed to renewing the enthusiasm for the constitutional regime and prepared the way for Rafael Riego to decide on his military uprising on January 1, 1820, in Cabezas de San Juan. After the Constitution was proclaimed again, he returned to Spain. He tried to carry out some of his theoretical economic and industrial plans and was elected deputy to Cortes Asturias. In Congress he opposed the project to abolish Patriotic Societies, because he always defended freedom: \\"freedom of printing, political freedom, civil liberty, freedom of customs, freedom of trade, freedom to speak and freedom of all will be his eternal and sweeter sing \\"1, was written of him. Although without representation in the Cortes, he wrote in 1822 with Francisco Mart√≠nez Marina, the first draft of the Spanish Penal Code. On March 3, 1823 he was appointed Minister of State. But the following month the arrival of the \\"One Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis\\" forced him to embark in Gibraltar to go into exile once more in London. During this expatriation, which lasted ten years, he published economics books, such as Efectos producidos en Europa por la baja en el producto de las minas de plata,(European effects from the decline in silver mine production), Examen de la crisis comercial de Inglaterra (Examination of the English commercial crisis) and Curso completo de econom√≠a pol√≠tica (Complete course of political economy). He returned to Spain on the death of King Fernando VII, engaging again in politics. He represented Asturias in all the legislatures from 1834 to 1840. He defends the concept of Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal's Ecclesiastical confiscations, although not his methods. He published, in this respect, his work On the alienation of the national goods (1836). He wrote several more books on economics, such as Elements of Political Economy, a textbook studied throughout the Spanish language for years. In 1846 he was appointed life senator and, aged eighty-seven years old, he died in the Miraflores de Nore√±a palace on December 16, 1853.  Memorials  His name is inscribed on the monument that Oviedo has dedicated to Asturian economists and financiers. The Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias, has a small portrait of him by an anonymous Englishman. The 25 pesetas bank notes that the Bank of Spain printed in 1946 has his portrait on the obverse and his manor house on Somiedo on the reverse.

The resolution was passed in a 15‚Äì0 vote, unanimously adopted by members of United Nations Security Council (UNSC). on November 21, 2017.  Positions Map of the migrant routes from West Africa to Europe. This resolution followed a debate on human trafficking. Several countries referred to a report from CNN. It showed how African migrants were sold in Libya at slave markets. The situation in Libya is exacerbated by the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking into, through and from the Libyan territory, which could provide support to other organized crime and terrorist networks in Libya. A week later, at the request of France, the Security Council met again in connection with that report. The country felt that Libya should work on the promised investigation of the practices, otherwise international sanctions would be imposed. Libya itself felt that it had become a victim of a smear campaign. Hundreds of thousands of migrants traveled through the country at a time when it was politically very unstable. Therefore, Libya could not be held responsible for international problems that it could not control. The underlying causes of human trafficking were cited and unstable countries of origin, in areas affected by armed conflict, such as money-laundering, corruption, the smuggling of migrants and other forms of organized crime, including by making use of financial investigations in order to identify and analyze financial intelligence, as well as by reinforcing regional and international operational law enforcement cooperation. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres thought that developed countries should take in more migrants. At that time, around 17,000 migrants were detained in centers in Libya. More than 100,000 people had already made the crossing to Italy that year. The Secretary General and several countries argued that the way in which groups such as IS and Boko Haram forced women and children for the purpose of sexual slavery, sexual exploitation, forced labor, and all acts of trafficking, particularly the sale or trade in persons, possibly amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. There were also countries that thought too many different anti- trafficking initiatives were being launched. That is why Spain proposed that the UNODC and other relevant entities should take the lead.  Content  By means of resolution 2331 of eleven months earlier, countries were asked to cooperate against human trafficking in conflict areas as a source of financing for terrorism. In the meantime, the establishment of the Task Team on anti- trafficking in humanitarian action within the Global Protection Cluster, the development by UNODC of a structured system of data collection on trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict, and the United Nations Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee included the efforts of countries in this regard in its assessments of countries in the fight against terrorism. The Security Council again condemned all acts of trafficking, particularly the sale or trade in persons undertaken by the ‚ÄúIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant‚Äù(ISIL, also known as Da‚Äôesh), including of Yazidis and other persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities, and of any such trafficking in persons crimes and other violations and abuses committed by Boko Haram, Al- Shabaab, the Lord's Resistance Army, and other terrorist or armed groups for the purpose of sexual slavery, sexual exploitation, and forced labor, and underscores the importance of collecting and preserving evidence relating to such acts in order to ensure that those responsible can be held accountable. Countries were called upon to step up the fight against human trafficking. Victims had to be well supervised. Countries also had to develop the necessary legislation to put an end to impunity. They could request support from the UNODC for this. Countries that received refugees were asked to look out for victims of human trafficking. They were also asked not to keep children in connection with their immigration legislation, or as short as possible. The Security Council itself would look at how peace operations and political missions could help in the fight against human trafficking.

He was essentially an amateur taxonomist, working alone for most of his career, not consulting the major tick collections or collaborating with other tick taxonomists. Life and career Born Leopold Ernst Paul Schulze on November 20, 1887 in Berlin, he graduated from high school in 1907 and studied science in Berlin, where in 1910 he became an assistant at the Zoological Institute of the University of Berlin.Universit√§t Rostock: Entry of \\"Paul Schulze\\" in the Catalogus Professorum Rostochiensium, URL: http://purl.uni-rostock.de/cpr/00003384 (retrieved on 26.06.2019). In 1911 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Zoology from the University of Berlin. The title of his dissertation was Die Nackengabel der Papilionidenraupen (The Osmeterium of the Papilionidae). During World War I, Schulze served as a soldier in a support role, behind the front lines, due to a heart problem. After this compulsory service, he completed post-doctoral work at the University of Berlin in 1918. In 1923, Schulze was appointed a full professor at the University of Rostock, serving from 1923 to 1945 as Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, Dean of the Faculty of Arts from 1931-1932, and as a Rector from December 1932 to March 1936. His professional contributions included serving as co-director of the university entomology seminar, co-editorship of Zeitschrift f√ºr Morphologie und √ñkologie der Tiere (Journal of Morphology and Ecology of Animals), and serving as Secretary of the Verein der Freunde der Naturgeschichte in Mecklenburg (Association of Friends of Natural History in Mecklenburg). In 1945, Schulze was dismissed from university service as a consequence of his membership in the National Socialist German Workers Party, which he had joined in 1937.Michael Buddrus and Sigrid Fritzlar. 2007.

Schulze died on May 13, 1949 in Rostock. Legacy Although many of the scientific names bestowed by Schulze have been synonymized, they remain important as molecular and morphological studies result in the reinstatement of other names that were once considered synonyms.

The General Assembly, Virginia's governing legislative body, did not ratify the Nineteenth Amendment until 1952. The argument for women's suffrage in Virginia began in 1870, but it did not gain traction until 1909 with the founding of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. Between 1912 and 1916, Virginia's suffragists would bring the issue of women's voting rights to the floor of the General Assembly three times, petitioning for an amendment to the state constitution giving women the right to vote; they were defeated each time. During this period, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia and its fellow Virginia suffragists fought against a strong anti-suffragist movement that tapped into conservative, post-Civil War values on the role of women, as well as racial fears. After achieving suffrage in August 1920, over 13,000 women registered within one month to vote for the first time in the 1920 United States presidential election.  Early efforts  Organizing for women's suffrage began in Virginia in 1870, when Anna Whitehead Bodeker, originally from New Jersey, invited suffragist Pauline Kellogg Wright Davis to speak in Richmond. Bodeker and other supporters of women's suffrage created the Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association in May 1870. During her time as president of the Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association, Bodeker tried to stir up public support of women's suffrage by contributing to local newspapers and inviting nationally known suffragists to speak in Richmond. Bodeker arranged to have Susan B. Anthony speak about suffrage in Richmond's federal courthouse in December 1870. Citing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S Constitution, Bodeker attempted to vote in a municipal election in Richmond in November 1871. She was unsuccessful. In place of a ballot, Bodeker put a note in the ballot box that read: \\"By the Constitution of the United States, I Mrs. A. Whitehead Bodeker, have a right to give my vote at this election, and in vindication of it drop this note in the ballot-box, November 7th, 1871.\\" Due to pressure for women in post-Civil War Virginia to adhere to traditional values of womanhood, Bodeker was unable to attract significant support for the cause of women's suffrage. The Virginia State Woman's Suffrage Association faded from the women's suffragist movement less than a decade after its founding. In 1880, Orra Henderson Moore Gray Langhorne unsuccessfully petitioned Virginia's General Assembly to allow women to vote in the presidential election. In 1894, Langhorne petitioned the General Assembly for female property owners to have the right to vote in state and national elections‚Äîalso unsuccessfully. Langhorne established the Virginia Suffrage Society (later called the Virginia Woman Suffrage Association) in 1893, as part of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She served as the society's president, as vice-president of NAWSA, and testified with other NAWSA suffragist at a 1896 United States Senate committee hearing on women's rights. However, due to low membership numbers and organizational challenges, the Virginia Suffrage Society closed before the turn of the century.  Equal Suffrage League of Virginia  Crenshaw's home, the site of the first meetings of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia In November 1909, a group of about 20 activists formed the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia in Richmond. The first meetings took place at Anne Clay Crenshaw's home, located at 919 West Franklin Street, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places, Crenshaw House, Richmond, VA, 127-0228-0029, 2010. https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/VLR_to_transfer/PDFNoms/127-0228-0029_Crenshaw_House_2010_NR_FINAL.pdf Lila Meade Valentine served as the league's first president. Other founding members included Kate Waller Barrett, one of Virginia's first female physicians; artists Adele Goodman Clark and Nora Houston; and writers Kate Langley Bosher, Ellen Glasgow, and Mary Johnston. The league joined NAWSA a few months after its founding. alt= While NAWSA favored organizing by electoral districts and putting pressure on politicians, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia had to take different approach. Aware of the widespread apathy towards the issue of suffrage in Virginia, the league's leaders knew that educating the public on suffrage was the only way to give the cause legislative traction. The Equal Suffrage League focused their legislative efforts on winning support in the General Assembly for a voting rights amendment to the state constitution.alt= The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia began educating the public about suffrage and drawing more women into the cause. Members canvassed house to house; distributed leaflets and \\"Votes for Women\\" buttons; and made speeches across the state. The league began publishing Virginia Suffrage News in 1914. The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia's membership grew from about 100 members in its first year to more than 15,000 by 1917. By 1919, with 32,000 members, it was the largest political organization in the state of Virginia, and perhaps the largest state association in the South. Meanwhile, some Virginia suffragists grew impatient with the painstaking process of petitioning the General Assembly for an women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution and educating the public on the value of giving women the vote. Some women left their local chapters of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia to join the more militant National Women's Party, joining efforts in pressuring the United States Congress and President Woodrow Wilson for a federal amendment giving women the right to vote.  Anti-suffragism in Virginia  = The role of women in society = Headquarters of the alt= In 1912, the Virginia Association Opposed to Women's Suffrage (VAOWS) was formed in affiliation with the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. Jane Rutherford served as president. The VAOWS began distributing anti-suffragist pamphlets claiming that, due to biological differences between the sexes, women were \\"easily excitable and impractical\\"; unable \\"to engage in political strife without calm minds\\"; and not \\"disposed to bother their heads with the actual facts of politics.\\" The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia responded to these claims by arguing that Virginia women were intelligent, sensible citizens, and taxpayers with interests ignored by male legislators of the time‚Äîeducation, health care, and child labor, specifically. In its early years, the league appealed to conservative views on a woman's traditional role as wife and mother, insisting that in order to be a good mother, a woman had to be a good citizen. A flier issued by the NAWSA and reprinted by the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia proclaimed that \\"the place of the woman is in the HOME\\" and \\"Women are, by nature and training, housekeepers...Let them have a hand in the city's housekeeping, even if they introduce the occasional house-cleaning.\\" = The issue of race = anti- suffrage flier By 1915, anti-suffragists in Virginia were openly tapping into racial fears. They warned that giving women the right to vote would also give African American women the right to vote, leading to blacks taking control of the polls and putting white supremacy in danger. A flier distributed by the VAOWS claimed that if both black men and women had the right to vote, then \\"Twenty-nine Counties Would Go Under Negro Rule.\\" At first, Virginia suffragists publicly ignored this element of the anti- suffragist argument. However, private exchanges within the Virginia suffrage movement showed differing views on the issue of giving African American women the right to vote. In a letter to Lila Meade Valentine, Mary Johnston wrote, \\"I think that as women we should be most prayerfully careful lest, in the future, women‚Äîwhether coloured women or white women who are merely poor‚Äîshould be able to say that we had betrayed their interests and excluded them from freedom.\\" Meanwhile, Valentine wrote to a friend, \\"I believe that all women, white or black, who meet the qualifications for suffrage in any State should have that right, but in working to secure that right, we should exercise common sense, and not complicate our efforts and add difficulties of the task by injecting elements of discord. As you know, the negro is the one remaining argument against suffrage in the Southern States . . . This is not a matter of principle but of expediency.\\" In 1916, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia distributed \\"Equal Suffrage and the Negro Vote,\\" a pamphlet arguing that \\"the enfranchisement of Virginia women would increase white supremacy\\" and assured readers that literacy tests and poll taxes would prove effective in disenfranchising African Americans.  Legislative challenges  Between 1912 and 1916, Virginia's suffragists brought the issue of women's voting rights to the floor of the General Assembly on three separate occasions; they were defeated each time. After the United States Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in June 1919, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia fought for ratification, but Virginia's politicians refused. On February 6, 1920 the Senate of Virginia rejected the amendment, 24 to 10; on February 12, 1920 it failed in the House of Delegates, 62 to 22.  After suffrage  = New organizations, continued race disparities, and the rush to register = left Virginian women won the right to vote in August 1920 when the Nineteenth Amendment became law and would go on to vote in the presidential election that following November. The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia disbanded a few weeks later and reorganized as the Virginia League of Women Voters, which would focus on educating women on how to register to vote and pay the poll tax. Members also participated in lobbying efforts for social welfare issues. Adele Goodman Clark, an original member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia, chaired the committee to establish the organization and served as its president from 1921 to 1925; she served a second term from 1929 to 1944. Black leaders in Richmond organized voter registration drives and voter education efforts. Maggie L. Walker, an African American businesswoman and the first woman in the United States to establish and serve as president of a bank, chaired a committee of female activists that held mass meetings to encourage black women to vote. Virginia women were only given one month to register to vote before the November 1920 presidential election, and registrars were not prepared for the large number of women voters. Three white women were hired to process white women's voter registrations; black women were left to stand in long lines as they waited to be registered. Walker went to City Hall and demanded the hiring of more officials to speed up the registration process. Ora Brown Stokes Perry, an African American social worker, unsuccessfully petitioned the registrar of voters to appoint African American deputies to register black women to vote, but none were appointed. Shut out from membership in the newly established Virginia League of Women Voters, African American women established their own organization: the Virginia Negro Women's League of Voters; Perry served as president. By early October, 13,000 women‚Äî10,645 white and 2,410 black‚Äîhad registered to vote.  Women's early participation in Virginia politics (1920 until state ratification)  220x220px In 1920, Mary-Cooke Branch Munford, a Richmond community activist and social reformer from was appointed to the Democratic National Committee. In 1923, Sarah Lee Fain and Helen Timmons Henderson become the first women elected to the Virginia's General Assembly; they took office in January 1924. Equal Suffrage League of Virginia co-founder Kate Waller Barrett served as delegate from Virginia to the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Between 1923 and 1933, six women‚Äîall teachers or educators and all Democrats, the state's majority party at the time‚Äîran successfully for the Virginia House of Delegates. In addition to Fain and Henderson, other female delegates during this time included: Sallie Cook Booker, Nancy Melvinna Caldwell, Helen Ruth Henderson, and Emma Lee White. No women served in Virginia's General Assembly between 1933 and 1954. In June 1948, Clintwood, Virginia elected its first female mayor, Minnie ‚ÄúSis‚Äù Miller, and an all- female city council: Buena Smith, Ida Cunningham, Ferne W. Skeen, Kate Friend, and Marian C. Shortt. They took office on September 1, 1948. The General Assembly of Virginia finally ratified the Nineteenth Amendment on February 21, 1952.

The new span is located just north of the original Champlain Bridge, which is currently being demolished. The new bridge carries eight lanes of automobile traffic of the A-10, A-15, and A-20, with one lane in each direction dedicated for buses. It also includes a multi-use lane for cyclists and pedestrians. The central portion of the bridge deck, still under construction, will carry the South Shore branch of the forthcoming R√©seau express m√©tropolitain (REM) automated light rail system. At wide, the new Champlain Bridge is the widest cable- stayed bridge in the world that uses two planes of cables. It is one of the largest infrastructure projects in North America and is one of the busiest crossings on the continent. It is built to last 125 years with the usage of stainless steel and high-performance concrete, and replaces the previous 57-year-old bridge, which has become functionally obsolete and its structure having been degraded by the repeated application of de-icing salt. Specifications The Champlain bridge is a crossing. It includes an asymmetric cable-stayed bridge with a main span, a concrete tower, and stay cables in a harp arrangement. The asymmetrical back span is . The west approach structure has 26 spans that are typically .The east approach is long and includes a span over Route 132. The bridge was built as part of a larger $4billion project that included: * The Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge * A new Autoroute 10 (A-10) approach * A new √Æle-des-S≈ìurs bridge and a highway on √Æle-des-Soeurs * Improvements to nearby parts of the A-15 The design of the Champlain Bridge addressed seismic activity, soil liquefaction, light-rail transit loading, ship collision, and ice loading. The bridge is configured with three separate decks, one for each direction of vehicular traffic and a third in the center for the R√©seau express m√©tropolitain rail corridor. The northbound deck is wider to include a multi-use corridor for cyclists and pedestrians, requiring the cable-stay bridge to be asymmetric in the transverse direction as well as longitudinal. The main tower is shaped like a tuning fork and is supported by 21 drilled piles. The decks are supported in the approach spans by W-shaped piers. Construction history In September 2007, faced with rising costs for the maintenance of the Champlain Bridge (commissioned in 1962), then Canadian Minister of Transport Lawrence Cannon confirmed that his department was seriously considering the construction of a replacement structure. In August 2008, Transport Canada announced that it was exploring different scenarios for a new bridge. In October 2011, then Minister of Transport Denis Lebel officially announced that construction on the new bridge would begin within 10 years. In November 2014, then Minister of Transport Lisa Raitt announced that she was abandoning the idea of naming the new bridge in honor of Maurice Richard after consulting the family of the former ice hockey champion. Prior to the 2015 Canadian federal election, the 28th Canadian Ministry planned on imposing a $2-$4 toll on the new bridge, however, this plan was abandoned following the election of the 29th Canadian Ministry. In April 2015, the federal government selected the JV consortium: Signature on the St. Lawrence Group to build the new bridge. The consortium mainly includes: SNC-Lavalin, ACS Infrastructure, and Dragados Canada. T.Y. Lin International is serving as the Lead Designer. Construction on the new bridge officially began on June 16, 2015. On December 19, 2018, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne announced that the official name of the new bridge will be the Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge. The bridge opened to northbound/westbound traffic on June 24, 2019 (St-Jean- Baptiste Day), with the official opening ceremony being held on June 28, 2019, and southbound/eastbound traffic opening on 1 July 2019 (Canada Day). The multi-purpose runway was opened in November 2019, while the REM train tracks are expected to be opened in 2021. Construction method View from the westbound roadway In order to meet the 42-month construction deadline, many steel and concrete bridge elements were prefabricated, with a portion of the work taking place on temporary piers. Three jetties were built: one on the east from Brossard, one on the west from Nuns' Island, and one from the center, adjacent to a dike along the Saint Lawrence Seaway. *The pier through the canal, allowed, by means of cofferdams, the storage of piles of construction material. *The central jetty served as a construction platform for the piers and towers of the section of the bridge utilizing guy-wires. Temporary pillars used during the construction of the Millau Viaduct in France were erected to support the cable-stayed span during construction. The main cable-stayed span above the seaway was assembled in segments by means of a crane. *The 500-meter (550 yards) long west pier was divided into three pre- assembly areas: a first for the concrete foundation footings that serve as the base for the viaduct section crossing the river, a second for the steel headers that complete the piles, and a third for the steel superstructures that wear the aprons. During the prefabrication of the 38 marine insoles, a pile primer and working platform were added to form a pile base measuring up to high. A super-transporter moved these stack bases from the prefabrication area to a loading area from where they were lifted by an industrial catamaran. The catamaran then deposited these bases in spaces drilled to a depth of into the riverbed. Two floating cranes finally overlaid the bases of the prefabricated elements to form piles and headers. The steel box girders supporting the three decks of the bridge were then deposited on the trimmers as they were completed.

Though referred to as the seventh of Frobenius' scientific expeditions to Africa it was a front for a German military espionage mission to Ethiopia. The objective was to restore communications with the German legation at Addis Ababa; persuade Ethiopian Emperor Lij Iyasu to support the Central Powers in the First World War and to proceed to Anglo- Egyptian Sudan to provoke an uprising there. This could have threatened British and Italian colonies in Eastern Africa and possibly the vital supply route of the Suez Canal. The expedition is thought to have comprised seventeen persons, five of European descent and twelve of Turkish or Arab origin. The European contingent left Berlin in October 1914 and rendezvoused with the other members in the Ottoman Empire (a German ally). After travelling by rail, cart, camel and dhow to Al Qunfudhah the party boarded a sambuk for the Red Sea crossing to Eritrea. Despite travelling incognito, the party is thought to have been identified by British agents and was intercepted by four British and French vessels but allowed on its way. The Italian authorities became aware of the expedition and it was abandoned, with the expedition being granted safe passage from Eritrea on 26 March 1915. Despite not entering Ethiopia, Frobenius heralded the expedition as a success and campaigned for the right to lead a follow-up expedition. The second expedition was instead led by Friedrich Salomon Hall in June 1915 and led to an agreement with Iyasu. The Ethiopian government lent their support to rebels in Entente Somaliland and burnt down several Italian radio stations but was ousted in a British- supported coup in 1916. Frobenius continued his scientific expeditions to Africa after the war but found it difficult to gain entry to British- controlled territories due to his involvement in this operation.  Background  Leo Frobenius was a self-taught German ethnologist and archaeologist who specialised in African cultures. He led twelve German Inner Africa Research Expeditions (, DIAFE) to Africa between 1904 and 1935. His work in the field is of considerable documentary value but his conclusions on the development of African civilisation from non-African origins were controversial and are not supported by modern writers. He has also been accused of using the expeditions to loot items of cultural value from Africa. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Frobenius was regarded as the foremost German expert on Africa. He was a close friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II and often corresponded with him.  Strategic aims  Territories in the Middle East and Africa at the start of the First World War. The Ottoman Empire is in light green, British Empire in pink, German East Africa is the dark grey territory at the bottom of the image. Ethiopia is in brown towards the centre of the image and Italian Eritrea is the red territory immediately north. , the German high command, were keen to secure the entry of Ethiopia into the war on the side of the Central Powers. Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the East Africa Protectorate, British Somaliland and French Somaliland were all possessions of the Entente Powers and the Germans hoped that an Ethiopian declaration of war would lead to territorial losses or else the withdrawal of Entente units fighting the Germans on the Western Front. Germany was also suspicious of the loyalty of the Italians, nominally members of the Central Powers but not yet participants in the war. If the Italians were to join the Entente Powers then Ethiopian forces would be ideally positioned to occupy Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. The Germans were hopeful that Ethiopian Emperor Lij Iyasu could be persuaded to ally with Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, a nationalist and religious leader who had fought the colonial authorities in the Somalilands since 1899. The Germans also had plans to instigate an uprising in Sudan which might threaten the Suez Canal and inspire a wider jihad against the British. The German government was unable to communicate directly with , their envoy at the German legation in Ethiopia, and messages had to be passed in cipher via disguised couriers on a route through the Ottoman Empire, the Red Sea and Italian Eritrea. The Germans planned an expedition to Ethiopia which would restore communications and advance their objectives for Ethiopia and Sudan. It was decided that this expedition would publicly be called scientific to disguise its military and political aims. Frobenius offered his services as leader of the expedition to the Kaiser on 13 November 1914, who directed that the expedition should proceed. The expedition would form the seventh of Frobenius' (German Inner-Africa Research Expeditions), though some sources incorrectly refer to it as his fourth expedition. In German intelligence circles it was codenamed HIDDEK, an acronym for (The main thing is that England is destroyed).  Planning  Frobenius had visited Sudan during his 1912 expedition but had no experience in Eritrea or Ethiopia and spoke none of the local languages. His plan was to carry mail to the legation, meet with Ethiopian politicians to secure their support for the German cause, proceed to Sudan to persuade the population to rise up and to strengthen links between the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim inhabitants of Sudan, Danakil, Somalia, Libya and Ethiopia. The expedition was fairly cheap owing to the use of equipment from Frobenius' previous expeditions and had funding of 60,000 German marks in a mixture of hard currencies including marks, Ottoman piastres, Austro-Hungarian Maria Theresa thaler and Italian lira. The German government also provided a quantity of weapons and ammunition. The Ottoman Empire was invited to join the expedition and accepted, hoping to return Egypt to their control. In advance of the expedition the Ottomans made diplomatic concessions to Ethiopia by returning ownership of a number of monastic properties in Jerusalem. Bekir Sami Kunduh The members of the expedition are disputed but are thought to have numbered around seventeen: five Europeans and twelve Turks or Arabs. The European members were Frobenius, ethnographer Albrecht Martius, photographer Robert T√ºrstig, foreign office official Hieronymus Kistenfeger and interpreter Mario Passarge. Amongst the other members was Bekir Sami Kunduh, the former governor of Libya and a future Turkish foreign minister and Friedrich Salomon Hall, a German citizen of Ethiopian origin. Hall's task was to lead the negotiations with the Ethiopian government. Frobenius is known to have valued titles and before setting out on the expedition insisted that he was granted various honours. He was awarded the title of (privy councillor), German resident at Darfur and Ottoman plenipotentiary in Arabia. He was also appointed the title of pasha of the Ottoman Empire, which he appended to his Arabic name \\"Abdul Kerim\\".  Journey to Africa  Berlin-Baghdad Railway train The expedition left Berlin in early October 1914 and travelled via Austria, Romania and Bulgaria to reach Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, on 21 November. They left the city on 24 December and travelled via the , the Berlin‚ÄìBaghdad railway, horse- drawn cart and camel via Aleppo to Damascus, Syria which they reached on 5 January. The party resided at the Hotel Victoria whilst the full complement of European staff was gathered. The expedition travelled from Damascus via the Hejaz railway to Jaffa in Palestine, where many of the Ottoman contingent were recruited. The party continued by rail to Al-\`Ula in north-western Arabia, arriving on 15 January 1915. They travelled south by Bedouin camel to Al Wajh on the coast of the Red Sea. Frobenius made careful assessments of the political condition of the regions he travelled through and reported to Berlin of the weakness of Ottoman forces in the area, the unpopularity of their Tripoli-born officials and the poverty and hunger caused by the British blockade and disruption of the Hajj pilgrimage. He also noted the success that the British were having in buying the loyalty of the Arab population with food shipments. A Red Sea sambuk The expedition left Al Wajh on 24 January and proceeded via dhow to Al Qunfudhah, arriving on 7 February. Here many of the expedition disguised themselves in Arab robes and posed as smugglers of animal hides; the Palestinian Arabs in the party were disguised as gardeners. T√ºrstig masqueraded as an official of the Red Cross and his eighty packs of photographic equipment were disguised as hospital supplies. On 13 February the expedition boarded a sambuk to make the crossing of the Red Sea to Africa. The Empress of Russia in the Red Sea The sambuk was intercepted on its first day of travel by the armed merchant cruiser Empress of Russia at the Farasan Islands; because of which Frobenius suspected that his movements in Arabia had been monitored by British agents. The vessel was allowed to proceed on its way until later that day when she was again brought to inspection by the French cruiser Desaix. The crew of the sambuk distracted the French sailors by trying to sell postcards to them whilst Frobenius' men used a toilet to enter the boat's sanitary tank. The expedition escaped detection and even managed to take a photograph of the Desaix through a crack in the sambuk's hull. The sambuk was stopped and inspected twice more by British vessels near Al Hudaydah and was again allowed to proceed on her journey. The sambuk docked at Massawa in Italian Eritrea on 15 February 1915. British intelligence services had tipped off the Italians about the expedition as early as February 1915 and the party received a cold reception from the Italian authorities. Suspicions were later raised that Passarge, Frobenius' interpreter, who held dual Italian and German citizenship and was a close friend of (a prominent Italian intelligence official), may have been a double agent. Frobenius also compromised the expedition by introducing himself in Massawa as a military captain.  Discovery  At Massawa the expedition members took part in hunting, other social activities and made visits to Zazega (near Asmara), Maji Malehesh, Lamdrara and Dembe Wadi Mudui to view rock engravings, of which 37 sketches were made. Compared to his previous expeditions, scientific output was much less, rather than thousands of photographs, the seventh expedition took fewer than one hundred. Von B√ºlow Some of the expedition members took rooms on board the Hamburg America Line vessel . The Italian chief of civil affairs in the town had the vessel monitored and was disturbed to find that Frobenius had bought an Italian flag (for use as a false flag), had purchased maps of the coastline and was making trips to identify potential landing sites. Frobenius also made contact with Bernhard von B√ºlow of the Foreign Office in Berlin to obtain diplomatic bags to carry mail to the German Legation in Addis Ababa. The presence of Frobenius in Eritrea was a threat to Italian neutrality but expelling him would also jeopardise it. The discovery of pro-jihadi leaflets in Frobenius' possession provided a convenient pretext. News of the leaflets was passed to the Italian parliament and soon after it was made public, B√ºlow made an appeal to the Italians to grant Frobenius safe passage to Germany. Lengthy negotiations between the British, French and Italian governments eventually resulted in an agreement, with the British foreign secretary Edward Grey happy to provide safe conduct to Frobenius in recognition of the work done to thwart his mission by the Italians. The expedition left Massawa on 26 March, the European members were given passage aboard the postal vessel Adalia for Port Said (in British Egypt) and the Arab and Turkish members boarded the Italian ship Montenegro for Jaffa and onward travel to Jerusalem where they arrived on 6 April.  Aftermath  From Port Said the European members of the party travelled on to Naples, Italy where they arrived in April 1915. T√ºrstig accompanied the expedition's equipment and the remaining ‚Ñ≥ 2,250.50 back to Germany via Genoa whilst the rest of the members travelled to Rome to meet with B√ºlow. The German consul in Naples tried to downplay the affair, claiming that Frobenius had acted only as a messenger to the legation in Addis Ababa, and Frobenius took part in several interviews with La Tribuna and press agencies to deny espionage and to play down the military background of his party. He later admitted his aim had been \\"to influence the Arab countries on behalf of the Ottoman government\\", admitted to military espionage and campaigned to be awarded a medal from the Italian authorities. Frobenius' indiscretion caused the German embassy some difficulties and he was sent back to Germany on 9 April, crossing the Austrian border shortly before Italy declared its intention to enter the war on the Allied side. Frobenius' lack of secrecy throughout the expedition has been named as a contributing factor to its failure. The failure of the expedition caused friction between the Germans and the Ottomans and the German ambassador to the Sublime Porte reported that \\"the Turkish government has become extremely sensitive by our various expeditions, especially that of Frobenius [which] has earned the biggest mistrust\\". Iron Cross 2nd Class In Berlin Frobenius presented the mission as a success, claiming to have made important contacts in the area and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. The failure seems to have caused no harm to his political or scientific standing in Germany. Frobenius proposed that he be dispatched immediately to lead a second expedition with the same aims. This request was denied and he was instead appointed to command a prisoner of war camp housing captured African and Indian soldiers. Frobenius spent the rest of the war consolidating his research from previous expeditions and cataloguing artefacts from his collection. His scientific output from the seventh expedition was lower than his previous expeditions. Fewer than 100 photographs were taken in Eritrea and only one paper, a study of local architecture published. His other expeditions had produced thousands of photographs and provided the basis for more than fifty books. A follow-up expedition was sent in June 1915 under command of Salomon Hall but he was captured by the Italian police whilst in disguise as a local. Hall managed to get documents passed to the German legation, which promised the Ethiopians a port on the Red Sea and any territory captured from the Allies in return for their cooperation. Emperor Iyasu sent weapons to Hassan and destroyed Italian radio stations but was deposed in 1916 after his excommunication by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which feared he had converted to Islam. The overthrow of Iyasu is thought to have been encouraged by the Allies and brought Ras Tafari Makonnen (later known as Emperor Haile Selassie) to power. Frobenius founded the Institute for the Morphology of Culture (later the Frobenius Institute) in Frankfurt in 1920 and became professor of ethnology at University of Frankfurt. He was keen to continue his expeditions into Africa after the war but found travel was more difficult now he was known to the British intelligence services. Frobenius' expedition to Sudan in 1926 was affected by a British refusal to grant him access to Khartoum and a proposed expedition to Rhodesia in 1927 had to be cancelled after he was blacklisted from travelling to the British colony. The final expedition he led to Africa (Libya 1933) was closely monitored by Italian authorities. Frobenius looked further afield and led expeditions to New Guinea and Australia in 1937‚Äì38, before his death in August 1938.

It visited modern-day South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. It recorded a large quantity of indigenous rock art, which helped Frobenius to build one of the most important collections of such work, some of which was sold to South African museums. It also investigated ancient ore mines and provided samples for some of the first metallographic and chemical analysis of southern African indigenous metals.  Background  Leo Frobenius Leo Frobenius was a self-taught German ethnologist and archaeologist who specialised in African cultures. He led twelve German Inner Africa Research Expeditions (Deutsche Innerafrikanische Forschungs-Expeditions, DIAFE) to Africa between 1904 and 1935.

However, his conclusions on the development of African civilisation from non-African origins were controversial and are not supported by modern writers. He has also been accused of using the expeditions to loot items of cultural value from Africa.  Planning  The ninth expedition was undertaken between August 1928 and March 1930 and visited Southern Africa ‚Äì including modern-day South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Frobenius led the expedition which consisted of his daughter, Ruth; three ethnographers (including Adolf Ellegard Jensen) and four artists. Its aims were to research \\"southern Erythraean cultures\\" (an ancient Greek designation for part of Africa), study the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, study ancient mines and to locate and copy \\"bushman drawings\\" (rock art). Frobenius was particularly keen to examine the rock art which he considered provided the \\"oldest tangible records of humanity\\". The expedition was planned to coincide with a joint meeting of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science and the British Association for the Advancement of Science in South Africa from July to August 1929.  Expedition  The expedition arrived in Cape Town in late 1928 and established at base at a large house in Eloff's Estate near Pretoria. The expedition spent the remainder of 1928 in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Basutoland. Over a period of five weeks the expedition visited 11 sites in the Drakensberg to record rock paintings. These, together with a series of engravings, were exhibited in Pretoria over Christmas at events attended by South African leaders Jan Smuts and James Hertzog. Smuts and Hertzog requested Frobenius' assistance with setting up collections of cultural documents in South African museums. Upon his return to Germany Frobenius published two substantial accounts of the expedition as Madsimu Dsangara, S√ºdafrikanische Felsbilderchroik and Erythr√§a, L√§nder und Zeiten des heiligen K√∂nigsmordes. = Rock art = From 17 January 1929 the expedition split into different parties: Frobenius and Jensen when to Southern Rhodesia and Mozambique by car and three of the painters went to Natal by train. Groups looked at rock art separately in Natal, the Cape Orange Free State, Basutoland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia and South West Africa. All members of the team were involved in locating and photographing the works while the painters and Frobenius made copies of the artwork. Frobenius documented one particularly extensive rock art site at Cinyati, which is now known as eBusingatha in the northern KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg. This site was affected by removal of some of the art in 1947 and a series of collapses in the late 1990s so Frobenius' documentation of the untouched site is valuable as a record of its earlier condition. The rock paintings date from between 500 and 1820 AD. In all Frobenius and his team made reproductions (primarily in watercolour) of 2,000 articles of African rock art from across Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa. This helped to make the Frobenius collection of the most significant records of rock art in the world in terms of scale and geographical coverage and Frobenius is sometimes credited with making the first major contribution to the study of rock art in Southern Africa. In addition to rock art the painters also captured aspects of local culture such as architecture and local dress. Some 400 of these paintings were produced, in addition to 3,000 photographs and a 16mm film reel. The expedition also recorded the stories, myths and poems of local people. Frobenius attempted to link the cultural record to the myths depicted in the rock art. Five hundred of the paintings were sold to the Iziko Museums of South Africa in 1931 for ¬£5,000. These are now held in the South African Museum in Cape Town and have been digitised and made available for viewing online. The remaining material and the written records are held by the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt, though in depth research on them has not yet been carried out. = Metallurgy = The expedition also collected a wide range of ethnological artefacts. Many of these were made of metal and were analysed in Germany by Professor EH Schulz. In addition the expedition explored prehistoric tin and copper mines in the northern Transvaal and Rhodesia and samples of metals recovered were also tested by Szhulz. This was the first metallographic and chemical analysis of southern African indigenous metal - ahead of GH Stanley's more famous work in the Transvaal in 1931. Schulz took samples from inconspicuous area of the artefacts, which were largely made from iron, steel and bronze. The bronze, which was used to make wire, rings and bead, was found to be made from a mixture of 90% copper and 10% tin - a similar composition to that found in modern bronze. In addition some beads were found to be made from pure copper or copper gilded with gold. A silver-based jewellery chain was also discovered. It was found to be of a unique alloy with copper and zinc that provided a durable and corrosion resistant material, amenable to melting and casting. Duncan Miller writing in 1992 considered it unlikely that this item was of African manufacture owing to the use of soldering and level of silver and zinc content. Schulz assessed several chisels and wedge tools that he found to be made of alternating layers of low and high carbon steel, similar to wrought iron. This may have been intentionally made so that the soft portion swore away to leave a fresh, hard cutting edge. He speculated that the tools were made using the bloomery hearth, which was invented circa 3000 BC. Some of the tools showed evidence that hardening had been achieved through quenching of the material.

The Tezos blockchain is linked to a digital token known as a tez/tezzie or XTZ. Unlike Bitcoin, Tezos does not rely on mining (Proof of Work), but instead utilizes a (delegated) Proof-of-Stake based consensus model. In August 2014, the project's founders released a paper called the \\"Position Paper\\", and in September of the same year the Tezos whitepaper was released. In 2017, the Tezos Foundation, a Switzerland based non-profit, raised $232 million in a fundraiser and became one of the biggest ICOs of the 2017 cryptocurrency boom. At Tezos, all stakeholders can participate in managing the protocol. The selection cycle offers a formal and systematic procedure for stakeholders to agree on proposed protocol changes. By combining this in-chain mechanism with self-change, Tezos can change this initial selection process to adopt better management mechanisms as soon as it is realized. The core change allows Tezos to take it to the next level without having to \\"fork\\" it into two different block chains. Design The primary protocol of Tezos utilizes proof of stake (PoS) and supports Turing complete smart contracts in a domain specific language called Michelson. In Tezo's PoS model, users can lend money to validators to earn partial staking rewards without validating blocks directly, not to be confused with being a validator. Validating transactions in Tezos is known as baking and validators are known as bakers. The Tezos protocol allows itself to be amended by a staged process performed by committing operations to the stored blockchain to submit proposals (intended code changes) and to vote on those changes. If a proposal receives enough votes the protocol updates itself to incorporate the code changes. Tezos is unique in that it requires users to participate in consensus, or risk having their tezzies lose value due to inflation of the network. Use cases In July 2019, Banco BTG Pactual S.A. together with Dalma Capital, a Dubai based asset manager, announced plans to utilize the Tezos blockchain for Security Token Offerings (STOs). In February 2019, Elevated Returns (ER), a financial group focused on digitizing traditional financial assets and best known for its tokenization of the St. Regis resort in Aspen, announced that it selected Tezos as the blockchain on which it will offer fully compliant tokenized real-estate offerings to qualified investors. Reliability In March 2019, the audit company Least Authority published the results of 5 checks, performed for Tezos Foundation during 2018. With high probability, Tezos protects against chain reorganizations and selfish-baking, which are 2 common issues in blockchains using Nakamoto style consensus. A subsequent analysis confirms that selfish baking in Tezos results in insignificant profits, even when the baker attempting it has a very large portion of the stake .  Tezos Foundation  The Tezos Foundation faced a management controversy about the use of raised funds by foundation president Johann Gevers. Johann Gevers resigned on February 22, 2018. The current Tezos Foundation Council has five members: Ryan Jesperson (President), Michel Mauny, Maryl√®ne Micheloud, Lars Haussmann, and Hubertus Thonhauser. Ryan Lackey was appointed in July 2019 as the 6th member of the Council.

He believes that with the concepts proven under the Prandtl-D \\"the time may be coming for a new paradigm in aviation.\\"  Development  The first full sized model of these to fly was designated \\"Prandtl-D No. 3\\", and flown in a series of tests on October 28, 2015 at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The aircraft is centered around the testing of yawing without a vertical stabilizer. The manager of the project, Albion Bowers, said that the aircraft is based on the flight of a bird. The Prandtl-D No. 3 first flew Oct. 28, 2015, with double the wingspan of the earlier versions, however, through development, the team managed to reduce the final glider's drag by 11%. Initially, each aircraft was radio operated with a hobby-grade controller and launched with a bungee cord system. Later flight tests switched from a bungee launch method to a towed launch system. The first two vehicles of the program showed twist of the airfoil in providing an bell shaped lift distribution instead of the elliptical distribution. This feature gave an efficiency boost and reduced strain on the wings. Later iteration of the vehicle using the bungee launch system In March 2016, Bowers published a technical paper entitled, ‚ÄúOn Wings of the Minimum Induced Drag: Spanload Implications for Aircraft and Birds,‚Äù NASA/TP ‚Äì 2016-219072. Detailing the aerodynamic properties and mathematics associated with the project, Bowers discusses in depth the science behind altering the spanload distribution on aircraft wings and the data gathered from experiments that demonstrated validation of its critical principles.  Specifications  The first two subscale Prandtl-D aircraft had a 12.5-foot wingspan and were constructed of a machined foam core wrapped in a skin of carbon fiber. The Prandtl-D No.3 has a wingspan of 25 ft, weight of 28 lbs, top airspeed of 18 kt, and a maximum altitude of 220 ft. The aircraft also has the Arduino flight control system used in the second Prandtl-D subscale model and is constructed of carbon fiber, fiberglass and foam. A key difference in the Prandtl-D full scale model is an addition of a University of Minnesota developed Data Collection System (DAC).  List of Vehicles in the Program  * Prandtl-D No.3 * Prandtl-D1 * Prandtl-D2 * Prandtl-D3 * Prandtl-3C  Future platforms  The Prandtl-D lead to start of the Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design to Land on Mars (Prandtl-M) program designed for Mar's Exploration. It has been tested in upper atmosphere of Earth and is designed to take topographic photos of Mar's surface. It also has provided a valuable platform for the Weather Hazard Alert and Awareness Technology Radiation Radiosonde Glider (WHAATRR) that will be used for atmospheric weather testing on Earth.

She was one of the first scientists to establish that hydrogen bonds could form to hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms. She later worked in the laboratory of Kathleen Lonsdale on the characterisation and prevention of urinary calculi.  Early life and education  Sutor was born in New Zealand, in the Auckland suburb of Parnell, on 6 June 1929, the daughter of Victor Edward Sutor, a coach builder, and Cecilia Maud Sutor (n√©e Craner). She was educated at St Cuthbert's College, and went on to study chemistry at Auckland University College. She graduated Master of Science with first-class honours in 1952 and, supervised by Frederick Llewellyn, she graduated with her first PhD in 1954. She published her first single-author Acta Crystallographica paper, The unit cell and space group of ethyl nitrolic acid, whilst a student. In 1954, Sutor went to the United Kingdom, and took up a travelling scholarship and Bathurst Studentship at Newnham College, Cambridge. There, she earned a PhD on the structures of purines and nucleosides in 1958. During her second doctorate, Sutor identified the structure of caffeine, and showed that it can readily recrystallise in its monohydrate form.  Research and career  Sutor moved to Australia in 1958, working as a research officer in Melbourne. In 1959, she returned to Britain to take up an Imperial Chemical Industries Fellowship at Birkbeck College, where she worked with J. D. Bernal, Rosalind Franklin, and Aaron Klug on the application of X-ray crystallography in molecular biology. She worked on hydrogen bonding and computational chemistry, writing programs for the EDSAC. Sutor used the concept of electronegativity, introduced by Linus Pauling in 1932, to explain hydrogen bonds. She investigated the Van der Waals distances that are shortened during hydrogen bonding, and based on her findings proposed that a C‚ÄìH group that is activated by partial ionization can take part in hydrogen bonding (so called C-H¬∑¬∑¬∑O bonds). She investigated the structure of theacrine, DNA and other purine compounds. In 1962, Sutor published the first crystallographic evidence for C-H ‚ãØO bonding. Her work expanded from small-molecule crystal structures to alkaloids. Her work was criticised by Jerry Donohue, who disputed her Van der Waals distances and claimed that she had data problems. At the time, Donohue's textbooks were in most laboratories, and he was a common reviewer for academic papers including crystal structures. Carl Schwalbe has speculated that this could have been due to academic jealousy, saying in 2019 that \\"acceptance of women in science, particularly the physical sciences, was by no means complete\\". Sutor moved back to New Zealand and worked briefly in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand) before taking leave to look after her father, who died in 1964. In 1966, Sutor was offered a job by Kathleen Lonsdale at University College London. She studied urinary calculi and searched for ways to prevent them. Sutor had good contacts with hospital staff, and even managed to secure Napol√©on III's bladder stone. She was supported by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation. In 1979, Sutor became partially sighted, and more \\"interested in the theoretical aspects of stone growth\\". Death and legacy Sutor died of cancer in London on 27 May 1990. She bequeathed her estate of over ¬£500,000 for the establishment of June Sutor Fellowships for research at Moorfields Eye Hospital into the prevention of blindness. Sutor's predictions on the hydrogen bond were confirmed by Robin Taylor and Olga Kennard in the 1980s. Their work included 113 neutron diffraction patterns in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database, and found that Sutor's C‚ÄìH‚ãØO bond distances were correct to within . Gautam Radhakrishna Desiraju dedicated a chapter of his book on hydrogen bonds to the work of Sutor, and Carl Schwalbe compared the structures cited by Sutor to modern redeterminations.

At the conclusion if the Vietnam War, between 1975 and 1995, it was estimated that approximately 200,000 Lao refugees, crossed the Mekong River into Thailand. Most stayed in the refugee camps while other moved to Bangkok looking for work. During the economic boom of the 1980s and as demands for labour increased. It was estimated that between 1980 and 1990 approximately 1.1 million ethnic Lao from Isan had moved from the northeast to central Thailand and Bangkok.Phongpaichit, Pasuk and Chris Baker. Thailand's boom. St Leonards: AlIen & Unwin; 1996. This, in turn, has helped popularize and create an unprecedented demand for Lao food outside of Laos and the northeast.Kislenko, Arne. Culture and Customs of Laos. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2009. 117. Print. Traditional Lao food such as sticky rice, papaya salad, larb, nam khao, kai yang, and khao jee etc., can now be found at street stalls and vendors in Bangkok and throughout Thailand.Van Esterik, Penny (1992): From Marco Polo to McDonald's: Thai cuisine in transition, Food and Foodways: Explorations in the History and Culture of Human Nourishment, 5:2, 177‚Äì193 The khao jee is made by forming the sticky rice into a patty or wrapped around a long stick acting as a vehicle or method of reaching the hot fire and flipping the sticky rice patties without burning one's hand, similar to toasting marshmallow over an open flame. The grilled sticky rice will form a cripsy and nutty outer layer while centre are hot and chewy. The most common and well-known way of eating Lao grilled sticky rice is with egg coating, but Laotians have been known to eat plain grilled sticky rice with a sprinkle of salt, or even coated in padaek, the traditional Lao fermented fish sauce. In Laos, the term \\"khao jee\\" can also refer to a Lao-style French bread or baguette. One of the ever-lasting and fully embraced remnants of French colonial rules in Southeast Asia. The khao jee bread is commonly use in Vietnamese b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches. The Lao variation of the sandwich is known as Khao Jee P√¢t√©.

It works by binding to exportin 1 and thus blocking the transport of several proteins involved in cancer-cell growth from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, which ultimately arrests the cell cycle and leads to apoptosis. It is the first drug with this mechanism of action. The most common adverse reactions in people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, appetite decrease, weight decrease, constipation, vomiting, and pyrexia. Selinexor was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2019, for use in combination with the corticosteroid dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is resistant to several other forms of treatment, including at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. In clinical trials, it was associated with a high incidence of severe side effects, including low platelet counts and low blood sodium levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Medical uses Selinexor is approved for use in combination with the steroid dexamethasone in people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteosome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (so-called \\"quad-refractory\\" or \\"penta- refractory\\" myeloma), for whom no other treatment options are available. It is the first drug to be approved for this indication. In June 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an additional indication for selinexor to treat adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. Adverse effects In the clinical study used to support FDA approval, selinexor was associated with high rates of pancytopenia, including leukopenia (28%), neutropenia (34%, severe in 21%), thrombocytopenia (74%, severe in 61% of patients), and anemia (59%). The most common non-hematological side effects were gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea), hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels, occurring in up to 40% of patients), and fatigue. More than half of all patients who received the drug developed infections, including fatal cases of sepsis. However, these data are from an open-label trial, and thus cannot be compared to placebo or directly attributed to treatment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ‚â•20%) in people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, appetite decrease, weight decrease, constipation, vomiting, and pyrexia. Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in ‚â•15% were thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and hyponatremia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of people, most often from infection. Thrombocytopenia was the leading cause of dose modifications. Gastrointestinal toxicity developed in 80% of people and any grade hyponatremia developed in 61%. Central neurological adverse reactions occurred in 25% of people, including dizziness and mental status changes. The prescribing information provides warnings and precautions for thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, hyponatremia, serious infection, neurological toxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Mechanism of action Ran cycle of nuclear transport. Selinexor inhibits this process at the nuclear export receptor (upper right). Like other selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs), selinexor works by binding to exportin 1 (also known as XPO1 or CRM1). XPO1 is a karyopherin which performs nuclear transport of several proteins, including tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and proteins involved in governing cell growth, from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm; it is often overexpressed and its function misregulated in several types of cancer. By inhibiting the XPO1 protein, SINEs lead to a buildup of tumor suppressors in the nucleus of malignant cells and reduce levels of oncogene products which drive cell proliferation. This ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and death of cancer cells by apoptosis. In vitro, this effect appeared to spare normal (non-malignant) cells. Inhibiting XPO1 affects many different cells in the body which may explain the incidence of adverse reactions to selinexor. Thrombocytopenia, for example, is a mechanistic and dose-dependent effect, occurring because selinexor causes a buildup of the transcription factor STAT3 in the nucleus of hematopoietic stem cells, preventing their differentiation into mature megakaryocytes (platelet- producing cells) and thus slowing production of new platelets. Chemistry Selinexor is a fully synthetic small-molecule compound, developed by means of a structure-based drug design process known as induced-fit docking. It binds to a cysteine residue in the nuclear export signal groove of exportin 1. Although this bond is covalent, it is slowly reversible. History Selinexor was developed by Karyopharm Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drugs that target nuclear transport. It was approved in the United States in July 2019, on the basis of a single-arm Phase IIb clinical trial. The FDA decided to grant accelerated approval despite a previous recommendation from an FDA Advisory Committee Panel which had voted 8‚Äì5 to delay approving the drug until the results from an ongoing Phase III study were known. Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone was granted accelerated approval and was granted orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Xpovio to Karyopharm Therapeutics. In June 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an additional indication for selinexor to treat adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. Approval was based on SADAL (KCP-330-009; NCT02227251), a multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial in participants with DLBCL after two to five systemic regimens. Participants received selinexor 60 mg orally on days one and three of each week. Research Under the codename KPT-330, selinexor was tested in several preclinical animal models of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, lymphomas, and acute and chronic leukemias. In humans, early clinical trials (phase I) have been conducted in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, blast crisis, and a wide range of advanced or refractory solid tumors, including colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. Compassionate use in patients with acute myeloid leukemia has also been reported. The pivotal clinical trial which served to support approval of selinexor for people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was an open-label study of 122 patients known as the STORM trial. In all of the enrolled patients, patients had been treated with a median of seven prior treatment regimens including conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy with bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and a monoclonal antibody (daratumumab or isatuximab); nearly all had also undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but had disease that continued to progress. The overall response rate was 26%, including two stringent complete responses; 39% of patients had a minimal response or better. The median duration of response was 4.4 months, median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, and median overall survival was 8.6 months. As of 2019, phase I/II and III trials are ongoing, including the use of selinexor in other cancers and in combinations with other drugs used for multiple myeloma. As of May 2020, it is in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 at locations including hospitals like Lehigh Valley Hospital.LVHN Among Early Participants to Test Cancer Drug as COVID-19 Treatment, LVHN website, May 7, 2020  References   External links  * Category:Antineoplastic drugs Category:Hydrazides Category:Orphan drugs Category:Pyrazines Category:Teratogens Category:Triazoles Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ","title":"Selinexor"},{"id":"61225879","title":"2019‚Äì20 Copa Catalunya"},{"id":"61225888","text":"John Grin's Christmas is a 1986 television film directed by and starring Robert Guillaume.

After moving to the United States about 1900, she married, and gained the nickname \\"Mother\\" after being granted custody of a runaway boy. She retired from jockeying to become a horse trainer. Berry and her husband settled in Helena, Montana, where, at age 111, she was declared the oldest person in Montana at the time. She lived to see women ride as licensed jockeys in 1969 and died at age 114.  Biography  Berry's family were Welsh and had settled in Australia. She was born in Melbourne on 21 June 1854. Berry started racing horses at age six. Her father provided tutors to come to her home twice a week to provide for Berry's education. Her first racing win was at age 10, when she placed first on the Moonee Valley Racecourse. She started racing professionally under the name of Jack Williams when she was 13 years old. and In order to look the part of a boy, she wore traditional racing silks on the track, and off the track donned a Bowler derby and smoked cigars. and She went on to race, disguised as a man, for more than 24 years as a jockey in Australia, England, France, Italy, New Zealand and South Africa. and During her jockeying career, she was and weighed . She told the Independent-Record that she won around 4,200 races during her career. American career Berry arrived in the United States about 1900, and initially rode races in Northern California. She met her future husband, veterinarian J.B. \\"Doc\\" Berry, in Seattle, and they married six weeks later on 21 June 1903. A judge in Colorado gave her the nickname \\"Mother\\" when awarding her legal custody of a runaway boy she had taken in and taught horse racing skills. Berry retired from riding horses in 1911. After her jockeying career was over, she continued to work with racehorses as a trainer. The Berrys moved to Helena, Montana, in 1913 and made the town their permanent residence. Berry raced horses on the Montana racing circuit and named several of them after her husband. Doc Berry died in 1927. In Helena, Mother Berry lived in a house at the Montana State Fairgrounds until 27 April 1937, when her home was destroyed by a fire. After the fire, she lived in a house on the local cemetery grounds for a few years.

Mike Snyder of the Houston Chronicle stated \\"The title reflects the elusive nature of Houston's most essential qualities.\\" \\\\- Newsbank Record # 3717416. Available from the Houston Public Library newspapers databases, accessible with a library card and PIN. Peter Kaufman of the Boston Architectural Center, now Boston Architectural College, wrote that the book serves \\"as a mosaic portrait of Houston over the 20th century\\" instead of being a collection of the most distinguished articles from the publication,Kaufman, p. 65. and the editors stated this in their notes.Vojnovic, p. 455. Background Scardino, Stern, and Webb were the publication's founding editors.Journal of Southern History (author not stated). p. 991. Contents The essays discuss the urban core and suburban areas of Houston; Snyder stated that the book \\"thoughtful balance\\" between the two. Ph.D. candidate James Wright stated that most of the articles oppose \\"Houston's disinterest in architectural equilibrium and unchecked impulse towards pastiche\\".Wright, p. 9. The essays include updates, current as of the time of publication, in the postscripts by the authors. This was done in lieu of revising the essays themselves.Prytherch, p. 266. Peter G. Rowe, the dean of Harvard University's College of Architecture, wrote the foreword. The book itself has three parts: I: Idea of the City, II: Places of the City, and III: Buildings of the City. These discuss city-wide, infrastructure and zoning issues; specific districts and neighborhoods; and specific buildings, landmarks, and notable persons in architecture, respectively. Scardino wrote the introduction to \\"Places of the City\\".Wright, p. 10. Christopher Dow wrote in Sallyport, the Rice University magazine, that the majority of the essays had a \\"descriptive\\" character. Landscape photographer Paul Hester created most of the photographs. The images also include maps and planning documents. The photographs are in black and white. Dow stated that the book uses many photographs. =Essays= In \\"Utopia Limited: Houston's Ring Around the Beltway\\", from 1994, Richard Ingersoll discusses his belief that master-planned communities like Clear Lake City, First Colony, Kingwood, and The Woodlands were not as well-planned as their reputations had stated; Ingersoll was a professor in the Rice University School of Architecture. Joel Warren Barna discussed development in Houston's innermost core, within the 610 Loop, in \\"In Filling the Doughnut,\\" from 1998. Phillip Lopate, a poet, wrote the article \\"Pursuing the Unicorn\\", describing how there is few public areas in the city. Reception Judith K. De Jong of the University of Illinois at Chicago concluded that the book \\"is an outstanding collection of essays, intelligently chosen and organized, well written and accessible, and compelling in its search for meaning in the \\"ephemeral\\" American city that Houston epitomizes so well.\\"De Jong, p. 70. She believed that the first section of the book was the best, arguing that its contents \\"establish a cohesive, comprehensible historical and cultural framework with which to understand the ever- changing physical character of this fascinating, yet often inscrutable, city.\\" Igor Vojnovic of Michigan State University stated that the book accomplished the goals the authors set out to do, that \\"there is much I like\\" about the book, and that the organization was superb. Stating that some sections and essays were better than others, he praised sections two and three, arguing that the best parts related to architectural topics, as well as favoring essays about districts and neighborhoods. He stated that Part I had unbalanced coverage that at times favored a pro-private interests market point of view, and that many essays did not have sufficient \\"social and critical analysis\\" and too much description.Vojnovic, p. 456. He also stated there was a dearth of content regarding to problems with the environment and \\"about racial and social disparities\\". David L. Prytherch of the University of Miami wrote that it \\"makes the contribution of looking carefully and without undue prejudice at sprawling metropolis that increasingly defines urban life. \\"He added that it is a \\"highly specific and place-bound kind of book\\" which would generally just appeal to people already interested in studying Houston and was written with the assumption that the reader is such. Wright stated that the introductions were \\"[c]ogent and well-written\\", and that \\"the book and its producers should be celebrated\\" as they \\"never fail to foreground the impossibility\\" of attempting to \\"initiate a definitive approach to Houston design\\". The Journal of Southern History stated that it was \\"a remarkably effective analysis\\" and that \\"there is no better introduction to [Houston].\\" Kaufman stated that it is \\"recommended especially for academic and regional collections on architecture and urban planning.\\" Dow wrote that \\"the volume is a testament to the excellence of the magazine that gave it life.\\" References # # # # # # =Notes= External links * - University of Texas Press Category:University of Texas Press books Category:Books about Houston Category:2003 non-fiction books ","title":"Ephemeral City"},{"id":"61225981","text":"Weems Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Maryland.

Omar al-Bashir overthrew the democratically elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi in 1989 and was himself overthrown in the April 2019 Sudanese coup d'√©tat, in which he was replaced by the Transitional Military Council (TMC) after several months of sustained street protests. Following further protests and the 3 June Khartoum massacre, the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance agreed on 5 July 2019 to a 39-month transition process to return to democracy, including the creation of executive, legislative and judicial institutions and procedures. On 17 July, the TMC and FFC signed a written form of the agreement. The Darfur Displaced General Coordination opposed the 5 July verbal deal and the Sudan Revolutionary Front, the National Consensus Forces and the Sudanese Journalists Network opposed the 17 July written deal. On 4 August 2019, the Draft Constitutional Declaration was initially signed by Ahmed Rabee for the FFC and by the deputy head of the TMC, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"), in the presence of Ethiopian and African Union mediators, and it was signed more formally by Rabee and Hemetti on 17 August in the presence of international heads of state and government.  History  = Background =  Previous democratic experiences  Sudan's 1948 election took place while Sudan was still under Anglo‚ÄìEgyptian rule, with the question of union or separation from Egypt being a major electoral issue. After independence in 1956, the following half century included a mix of national elections, constitutions, coalition governments, coups d'√©tat, involvement in the Chadian Civil War (2005‚Äì2010), islamisation under the influence of Hassan al-Turabi (1989‚Äì1999) and the secession of South Sudan (2011).  Al-Bashir rule  Omar al-Bashir's rule started with the 1989 Sudanese coup d'√©tat and ended with the April 2019 Sudanese coup d'√©tat during the Sudanese Revolution (December 2018 ‚Äì September 2019). = July 2019 agreements =  5 July verbal deal  On 5 July, with the help of African Union mediator Mohamed El Hacen Lebatt and Ethiopian mediator Mahmoud Drir, a verbal deal was reached by the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance, including Siddig Yousif and Ibrahim al- Amin, on the formation of governmental institutions, under which the presidency of the transitional government would rotate between the military and civilians. The initial verbal deal agreed to by the TMC and the civilian negotiators included the creation of a \\"sovereignty council\\", a 39-month transition period leading to elections, a cabinet of ministers, a legislative council, and an investigation into the Khartoum massacre. Tahani Abbas, a cofounder of No to Women's Oppression, stated her worry that women might be excluded from the transition institutions, arguing that women \\"[bear] the brunt of the violence, [face] sexual harassment and rape\\" and were active in organising the protests. The Minnawi and al-Nur factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, a Darfur armed rebel group, both stated on 5 July that they rejected the deal, arguing that the deal would not achieve an \\"equal citizenship state\\". The Rapid Support Forces attacked people celebrating the deal in Abu Jubaiyah by beating them, firing tear gas, and shooting live bullets into the air. One person was hospitalised for serious wounds.  17 July written Political Agreement  Following the 5 July verbal agreement, drafting of a written agreement by a committee of lawyers, including African Union lawyers, was promised to take place \\"within 48 hours\\". On 9 July, the 4-person drafting committee, including Yahia al-Hussein, stated that the text had not yet been finished. The new time schedule was for the agreement to be signed \\"within ten days\\" in a ceremony including regional leaders. On 13 July, three sticking points delaying the signing of the agreement included the FFC requiring the human rights investigation committee to exclude people suspected of responsibility or implementation of the 3 June Khartoum massacre; the FFC requiring a limit on the time frame for appointing the legislative council; and disagreement between the FFC and the TMC regarding TMC \\"endorse[ment] or [approval] of the nominees\\". A written form of the deal as a \\"political agreement\\", with a constitutional declaration to follow later, was signed by the TMC and FFC on 17 July.  Objections to the 5 and 17 July 2019 agreements  The Darfur Displaced General Coordination, representing people from Darfur displaced in relation to the Darfur genocide, objected to the 5 July verbal agreement, describing it as \\"flawed in form and content\\" and \\"a desperate attempt to sustain the rule of the National Congress Party\\", the dominant political party of Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule of Sudan. In the days following the 17 July written deal, rebel groups represented by the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), the National Consensus Forces (NCF), a coalition of political parties that opposed al-Bashir's National Congress, and the Sudanese Journalists Network objected to the signed written agreement. The NCF and the SRF said that the FFC had signed the deal in Khartoum without waiting for the NCF and other opposition forces, who had still been discussing the proposed deal in Addis Ababa. The NCF stated that the deal \\"goes towards granting of power to the military junta\\", and that the deal does not provide for an international investigation into \\"crimes committed throughout\\" al-Bashir's rule. The Sudanese Journalists Network said that the written deal \\"strengthens the power of the junta, ... and tries to usurp power by stealing the efforts, sweat and blood of the revolution.\\" The NCF called for the draft constitutional declaration to be circulated for comment prior to signing so that it take into account NCF's concerns. = 4 August/17 August Draft Constitutional Declaration = Sudanese protestors celebrate the ratification of the Draft Constitutional Declaration (19 August 2019). On 4 August 2019, the Draft Constitutional Declaration (or Draft Constitutional Charter) was signed by Ahmed Rabee for the FFC and by the deputy head of the TMC, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"), in the presence of Ethiopian and African Union mediators. The document contains 70 legal articles, divided into 16 chapters, defining transitional state bodies and procedures. Rabee and Hemetti signed the document more formally on behalf of the FFC and the TMC on 17 August 2019, in the presence of Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Salva Kiir, President of South Sudan, and other heads of state and government.  Objections to the 4 August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration  The Darfur Displaced General Coordination objected to the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration, arguing that peace requires the disarming of militias; provision of all five suspects wanted in the International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur and the expulsion of new settlers from traditionally owned land in Darfur. Minni Minawi stated that the SRF objected to the Draft Constitutional Declaration on the grounds that an agreement made among component groups of the FFC in Addis Ababa concerning mechanisms for a nationwide peace process in Sudan was excluded from the declaration and that the declaration constituted a power-sharing agreement between the FFC and the TMC. = Legal reform = The legal reform was initiated by the Political Agreement of 17 July 2019, Article 20 of which mandated 'a legal reform program and rebuilding and developing the justice and rights' system and ensure the independence of judiciary and the rule of law.' Many of the reforms affect the Sudanese Criminal Code of 1991 (also known as the Criminal Act or Penal Code). Some attempts had been made under al-Bashir's rule to reform legislation on issues such as extramarital rape victim blaming via 'adultery', and impunity for marital rape, by amending the definition of rape in Article 149.1 of the Criminal Code in February 2015. However, several commentators such as the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies argued that this amendment had a number of flaws. Even though the amendment made it possible to prosecute marital rape by removing the reference to adultery, there is still no specific prohibition of marital rape, and oral rape is not criminalised. Moreover, Article 149.2 still defined adultery and sodomy as forms of 'rape', so complainants still risked being prosecuted for adultery or sodomy if they failed to prove they were subjected to sexual acts without their consent. Finally, the importance of consent was diminished in favour of coercion, going against the trend in international law to define sexual violence by lack of consent.  Constitutional principles of legal reform (August 2019)  The Draft Constitutional Charter (also known as the Draft Constitutional Declaration) that was agreed in August 2019 further detailed how this reform was to take place during a 39-month transitional period, and in which areas of law these were to be focused. Article 2 of the Charter specifies that 'The Transitional Constitution of Sudan of 2005 and the constitutions of provinces is [sic] repealed, while the laws issued thereunder remain in force, unless they are repealed or amended. The decrees issued from 11 April 2019 until the date of signature of this Constitutional Charter remain in force, unless they are repealed or amended by the Transitional Military Council. If they contradict any provisions of this Constitutional Charter, the provisions of the present Declaration prevail.' Articles 3 and 5 outline what kind of state and society Sudan is, or should become: a parliamentary democracy with equal citizenship for all, that is 'founded on justice, equality, and diversity and guarantees human rights and fundamental freedoms,' where the rule of law prevails and 'violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law' and other transgressions are punished, including those committed by the 1989-2019 regime (a point reiterated in Article 7.3). Article 4 establishes the principle of popular sovereignty, and that provisions of existing laws 'that contradict the provisions of this Constitutional Charter shall be repealed or amended to the extent necessary to remove the contradiction'. Articles 6 and 7 outline the transitional process by which Sudan will be transformed into what kind of society it should become. Article 7.5 is an almost exact copy of Article 20 of the Political Agreement, thus reiterating the general commitment to legal reform. Further specifications are mentioned: * 7.2 'Repeal laws and provisions that restrict freedoms or that discriminate between citizens on the basis of gender.' * 7.7 'Guarantee and promote women‚Äôs rights in Sudan in all social, political, and economic fields, and combat all forms of discrimination against women, taking into account provisional preferential measures in both war and peace.' * 7.15 'Dismantle the June 1989 regime's structure for consolidation of power (tamkeen), and build a state of laws and institutions.' Articles 41 to 66 provide a set of fundamental human and civil rights and freedoms that all Sudanese citizens are entitled to. Notably, Article 50 prohibited 'torture or harsh, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, or debasement of human dignity.' Furthermore, Article 53 envisioned restriction of the death penalty to cases of 'retribution (qasas), a hudud punishment, or as a penalty for crimes of extreme gravity, in accordance with the law', exempting people younger than 18 or older than 70 years from execution, and postponing execution for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  Repeal of the public order law (November 2019)  On 29 November 2019, Article 152 of the Criminal Code (commonly referred to as the Public Order Law or the Public Order Act) was repealed. It was controversial for various reasons, for example, because it was used to punish women who wore trousers in public by lashing them 40 times. Other restrictions targeting women that were repealed included the lack of freedom of dress (by the mandatory hijab and other measures), movement, association, work and study. Alleged violations (many of whom were considered 'arbitrary' by activists) were punished with arrest, beatings and deprivation of civil rights such as freedom of association and expression. According to Ihsan Fagiri, leader of the No to Oppression Against Women Initiative, around 45,000 women were prosecuted under the Public Order Act in 2016 alone. It was seen as an important first step towards gradual legal reform to improve the status of women's rights in the country as envisioned by the Charter. On the same day, the Dismantling of the Salvation Regime Act was adopted, which disbanded the former ruling National Congress Party of Omar al-Bashir, set up a committee to confiscate the vast assets of the party (many of which were allegedly illegitimately obtained from the population through 'looting', 'stealing' and corruption), and banned 'the symbols of the regime or party' from 'engaging in any political activity for a period of 10 years'.  Miscellaneous Amendments Act (April‚ÄìJuly 2020)  On 22 April 2020, the Transitional Legislative Council passed a series of bills that would amend other parts of the Criminal Code of 1991. Amongst other things, female genital mutilation (FGM) was criminalised and made punishable by a fine and 3 years imprisonment. The resulting legal changes were bundled as the 'Miscellaneous Amendments Act' (also called 'Fundamental Rights and Freedoms Act' by some media) and sent to the Sovereignty Council for approval, which took several months to review them. According to Justice Minister Nasreldin Abdelbari, some details were added to the Act by the Ministry of Justice following comments made by the Sovereignty Council 'in a manner that does not undermine the law'. The Miscellaneous Amendments Act was finally signed by Sovereignty Council Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and published in the Official Gazette on 9 July 2020 and thus became law. The Miscellaneous Amendments Act (or 'Fundamental Rights and Freedoms Act') had various consequences, including the following: * Female genital mutilation (FGM) was criminalised and made punishable by a fine and 3 years imprisonment. * Apostasy by Muslims was no longer punishable by death, and takfir was criminalised. Article 126 of the Criminal Code of 1991 had prescribed the death penalty or life imprisonment for renouncing Islam. Reportedly, apostasy was still illegal, although the punishment for it was not clear, while prosecutors were ordered to protect those accused of apostasy. * Women no longer needed to obtain permission from a male relative to travel abroad with their children. * Flogging as a form of punishment was abolished. * The sodomy law was amended: male participants in anal sex (sodomy, whether between two men or between a man and a woman) were no longer punishable by death or flogging, but still punishable by imprisonment. * Non-Muslims (an estimated 3% of the Sudanese population) were no longer banned from selling, importing and consuming alcohol (Articles 78 and 79). Meanwhile, Muslims were still prohibited from drinking alcohol, and the law did not address the opening of bars, which Abdelbari deemed to be a more complicated matter to be discussed in the future. He stated that if a Muslim and a non-Muslim were found drinking alcohol together, the latter might be charged with complicity. * The Information Law was amended to lower punishments for any violation; it was nevertheless deemed important that the prosecutor could legally counter 'rumours and false allegations'. Moreover, a bill reforming the legal and justice system and the Anti-Cyber Crime Act were signed into law on the same day as well.  Religion/state separation and recognition of diversity (September 2020)  As part of the ongoing peace process between the transitional government and various rebel groups, an agreement was reached on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi- cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.' Secularism had long been a demand of the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction, with a spokesperson saying: 'The problem is (...) to address why people became rebels? Because there are no equal citizenship rights, there is no distribution of wealth, there is no equal development in the country, there is no equality between black and Arab and Muslim and Christian.'  Reactions and demands from activists  Women's rights activists such as 500 Words magazine editor Ola Diab and Redress legal advisor Charlie Loudon hailed the abolition of repressive measures and restrictions on women as 'great first steps'. They emphasised that the new laws needed to be enforced and the repealed laws also abandoned in practice, which would require revision of the internal policies of government agencies such as the police, the military and intelligence services. Several other laws that activists demanded to be removed included the prosecution of rape victims for 'adultery' (Article 149.2), and of women in mixed-sex settings for 'prostitution' (Article 154), other articles dictating women's dress code, and the disbandment of the public order police and dedicated courts that were part of the 'public order regime'. Justice Minister Abdelbari stated in July 2020 that he was also considering to abolish the Personal Status Law to protect women's rights. Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA) Regional Director Hala al- Karib praised the Act \\"as a good step in the right direction\\", but urged the transitional government to press on with more reforms, pointing out that the guardianship system was still enforced through other legislation such as 'passports, immigration and the issuance of official documents and even the record of deaths and births'. Al-Karib also called upon the government to sign, ratify and abide by the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol). Other activists claimed there were still other forms of 'legal discrimination' that made women vulnerable to violence such as 'marital rape, and [being] prevented from leaving the home, working, choosing where to live, and [being] treated less equally by other family members.' Sudanese LGBT+ activists hailed the abolition of the death penalty and flogging for anal sex as a 'great first step', but said it was not enough yet, and the end goal should be the decriminalisation of gay sexual activity altogether. Human Rights Watch (HRW) praised the transitional government on various steps it had taken for legal reform, including the repealing of the public order law and the apostasy law, the criminalisation of FGM, and the approval of draft laws establishing commissions to work on human rights and transitional justice reforms, but urged it to accelerate its pace of legal and institutional reform and to better consult with civil society groups on new laws before passing them. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), having earlier scrapped Sudan from the list of 'countries of particular concern' (where it had been in 2000‚Äì2019) due to its initial reforms, applauded in particular the new reforms relating to women's rights and the apostasy law on 15 July 2020. However, it urged Sudanese lawmakers to repeal the blasphemy law (Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code) as well, and to ensure 'that laws regulating hate speech comply with international human rights standards and do not impede freedom of religion or belief'. = Foreign relations = The Trump administration, seeking to appeal to American pro- Israel voters during its 2020 reelection campaign by normalising relations between various Arab-majority states and Israel, sought to move the transitional government to normalise Israel‚ÄìSudan relations by concluding a formal peace deal. It also offered to remove Sudan from its list of state- sponsors of terrorism in return for 335 million US dollars in compensation to families of victims of the 1998 United States embassy bombings by al-Qaida, which the US government alleged the previous Sudanese regime played a role in. For the Sudanese transitional government, it was important to receive financial aid and open up trade opportunities in the midst of several ongoing crises, including decades of economic mismanagement under Bashir's regime, an unfinished internal peace process, recent political upheaval and the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of Sudanese in hardship as food and fuel prices had soared. Therefore, in mid-October 2020, it agreed to pay the compensation and distanced itself from the pro-terrorist activities of the Bashir regime in order to lift the anti-terrorist sanctions imposed in 1993 and obtain access to foreign loans and recover the economy. Separately, Sudan had already been conducting negotiations for peace with Israel, and by mid-October had agreed to allow flights to Israel to overfly its territory.  TMC‚ÄìFFC Political Agreement and Constitutional Declaration  The TMC and FFC signed the written form of the Political Agreement on 17 July 2019 in front of witnesses representing the African Union, Ethiopia, and other international bodies. Elements of the agreement included: * the creation of an 11-member Sovereignty Council with five military members and five civilians to be chosen by the two sides and a civilian to be agreed upon mutually; * a transition period of 3 years and 3 months, led by a TMC member for the first 21 months and a civilian member of the Sovereignty Council for the following 18 months; * the creation of a constitutional document for the transitional period; Article 9.(a) of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration defined the Sovereignty Council as the head of state of Sudan; * a Council of Ministers to be appointed mostly by the FFC, with the Sovereignty Council and its military members having a partial role in the decision; * a ban on members of the transitional period Sovereignty Council, Council of Ministers and state governors from being candidates in the first elections ending the transitional period; * a legislative council to be created within three months of the creation of the Sovereignty Council; * the creation of a Sudanese \\"precise and transparent\\", independent investigation into the Khartoum massacre and \\"related\\" human rights violations incidents; * a six-month peace program for Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan; * initiating a procedure for preparing a new constitution; * establishing transitional justice mechanisms. Democratic elections to determine leadership following the 39-month transition period were mentioned in the initial verbal agreement and briefly referred to in the written agreement. Article 19 of the Draft Constitutional Declaration forbids \\"the chairman and members of the Sovereignty Council and ministers, governors of provinces, or heads of regions\\" from \\"[running] in the public elections\\" that follow the 39-month transition period. Article 38.(c)(iv) of the declaration states that the chair and members of the Elections Commission are to be appointed by the Sovereignty Council in consultation with the Cabinet. =Draft Constitutional Declaration= 4 August signed Constitutional Declaration The 17 July written deal stated, as did the initial verbal deal, that a constitutional agreement for the transition period was planned, and that preparations for a creating a new permanent constitution would be made during the transitional period. Sudan's previous constitution was the 2005 Interim National Constitution. On 25 July, Mohamed El Hafiz of the FFC legal committee stated the FFC's requested changes to a draft of the constitutional declaration. The FFC removed a draft article of the declaration that would have giving immunity from prosecution to TMC and Sovereign Council leaders. The FFC required that reform of the security forces be carried out by a civilian, not military authority; that the Sovereign Council should only have ceremonial powers; that the Sovereign Council and Cabinet should together prepare laws pending creation of a Legislative Council; and that the Legislative Council should have full legislative powers, including the creation of land, law and election reform commissions. The FFC's comments on the draft covered \\"85 articles and items\\". The Constitutional Declaration was signed by Ahmed Rabee for the FFC and deputy head of the TMC, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, on 4 August 2019, in the presence of Ethiopian and African Union mediators. Full ratification was planned for 17 August 2019. =Sovereignty Council= The 11-member Sovereignty Council is defined by Article 9.(a) of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration as the head of state of Sudan. Planned membership of the Sovereignty Council includes military members Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"), Lieutenant-General Yasser al-Atta, and two other military members chosen by the TMC; five civilians chosen by the FFC: Aisha Musa el-Said, Siddig Tower, Mohamed Elfaki Suleiman, Hassan Sheikh Idris and Mohammed Hassan al-Ta'ishi; and a civilian, Raja Nicola, chosen by mutual agreement. The Sovereignty Council is mostly male, with only two women members: Aisha Musa and Raja Nicola. =Council of Ministers= The Political Agreement gave the FFC the choice of the ministers of the transitional government, with the sovereignty council holding the right to veto nominations, apart from the defence and interior ministers, who are to be \\"selected\\" by military members of the Sovereignty Council and \\"appointed\\" by the prime minister. The prime minister can \\"exceptionally nominate two party qualified members to fulfill ministerial positions.\\" Chapter 5 (Article 14) of the Draft Constitutional Declaration defines the Transitional Cabinet in similar terms, but gives the Prime Minister the right to choose the other members of the cabinet from a list provided to him or her by the FFC. The cabinet members are \\"confirmed by the Sovereignty Council\\". Article 16.(a) of the Draft Constitutional Declaration requires the Prime Minister and members of Cabinet to be \\"Sudanese by birth\\", at least 25 years old, a clean police record for \\"crimes of honour\\". Article 16.(b) excludes dual nationals from being a Minister of Defence, Interior, Foreign Affairs or Justice unless an exemption is agreed by the Sovereignty Council and the FFC for the position of Prime Minister, or by the Sovereignty Council and the Prime Minister for ministerial positions. Abdalla Hamdok, a Sudanese public administrator who served in numerous international administrative positions during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, was nominated by the FFC as Prime Minister, with a formal appointment scheduled for 20 August 2019. =Transitional Legislative Council= Chapter 7 of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration defines plans for the Transitional Legislative Council. The transition deal (23.(4) of the Draft Constitutional Declaration) sets the transitional Legislative Council to be formed three months after the transitional period starts, after the sovereignty council and cabinet are determined. In the 17 July deal, the FFC and TMC agreed to disagree on the proportions of membership of the Legislative Council. The FFC \\"confirm[ed] its adherence\\" to selecting two thirds of the council's members and the TMC \\"confirm[ed] its position on reviewing the legislative council membership percentages.\\" The FFC and TMC agreed that their respective members of the Sovereignty Council would continue \\"discussion\\" on the issue. In 23.(3) of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration, 67% of the members are to be selected by the FFC and 33% by \\"other forces\\" who didn't sign the FFC declaration of January 2019. Article 23.(3) of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration sets a minimum 40% quota for women membership of the Transitional Legislative Council. Article 23.(1) sets the maximum membership to 300 and excludes membership by members of the National Congress that dominated under al-Bashir and of political forces that participated in the al-Bashir government. Membership is open, under Article 25, to Sudanese nationals at least 21 years old, who \\"[possess] integrity and competence\\", have not been criminally convicted for \\"honour, trustworthiness, or financial responsibility\\", and can read and write. =Judicial bodies= Chapter 8 of the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration replaces previous existing judicial bodies by a new Supreme Judicial Council and a Constitutional Court. It declares in Article 29.(2) that the \\"judicial authority\\" is independent from the Sovereignty Council, the Transitional Legislative Council and \\"the executive branch\\", with sufficient financial and administrative resources to be independent. In Article 30.(1) it defines the Constitutional Court to be independent and separate from the judicial authority. It was initially suggested by Khartoum Star and Sudan Daily that Nemat Abdullah Khair was to be sworn in as Chief Justice on 20 August or 21 August 2019. On 10 October 2019, her nomination was confirmed by decree. Article 29.(3) states that the head of the judiciary is also the president of the Supreme Court and is \\"responsible for administering the judicial authority before the Supreme Judicial Council.\\" =Human rights= In the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration, Chapter 14 defines \\"Rights and freedoms\\". Article 41.(2) states that all international human rights agreements, pacts, and charters ratified by the Republic of Sudan are considered to be \\"an integral part\\" of the Draft Constitutional Declaration. =Investigation= The deal was described on 5 July as including the creation of a \\"transparent and independent investigation\\" into the events that followed the 2019 Sudanese coup d'√©tat, including the Khartoum massacre. On 8 July, Associated Press described the investigation as \\"Sudanese\\". The 17 July written political agreement stated that the investigation committee \\"may seek any African support if needed.\\" The 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration refers to the investigation in Article 7.(16) as an element of the \\"Mandate of the Transitional Period\\", defining the scope as \\"violations committed on 3 June 2019, and events and incidents where violations of the rights and dignity of civilian and military citizens were committed.\\" The investigation committee is to be created within a month of the Prime Minister's nomination, under an \\"order\\" that \\"guarantees that it will be independent and possess full powers to investigate and determine the timeframe for its activities\\". ;Immunity According to an anonymous military official present at pre-5 July negotiations and quoted by The Christian Science Monitor, US negotiators led by Donald E. Booth proposed that TMC members be guaranteed immunity from prosecution in the investigation. The military official stated, \\"The Americans demanded a deal as soon as possible. Their message was clear: power-sharing in return for guarantees that nobody from the council will be tried.\\" On 13 July, the FFC opposed 3 June Khartoum massacre suspects being members of the investigating committee. The 17 July written deal does not refer to immunity for TMC members. On 25 July, Mohamed El Hafiz of the FFC legal committee stated its requests for changes to a draft of the constitutional declaration. This included the removal of a draft article that would have given immunity from prosecution to TMC and Sovereign Council leaders. El Hafiz said that neither absolute nor procedural immunity would be accepted for any leader. On 31 July, TMC leader al-Burhan \\"confirmed that the members of the [junta] do not desire immunity\\". On 1 August, the FFC accepted that Sovereign Council members could have \\"procedural immunity\\", defined to mean that Sovereign Council members would have immunity that could be lifted by a two-thirds supermajority vote of the legislative council. In the 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration, Article 21 gives procedural immunity to members of the Sovereignty Council, the Cabinet, the Transitional Legislative Council, governors of provinces and heads of regions, with 21.(2) giving the Transitional Legislative Council the right to lift that immunity by a simple majority. ;Creation The Khartoum massacre investigation commission, headed by human rights lawyer Nabil Adib, was nominated on 20 October 2019 by Prime Minister Hamdok. =Comprehensive peace= The 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration lists \\"achieving a just and comprehensive peace, ending the war by addressing the roots of the Sudanese problem\\" as Article 7.(1), the first listed item in its \\"Mandate of the Transitional Period\\", and gives details in Chapter 15, Articles 67 and 58 of the document. Article 67.(b) says that a peace agreement should be completed within six months of the signing of the Draft Constitutional Declaration. Article 67.(c) requires women to participate in all levels of the peace procedure and for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 to be applied, and legal establishment of women's rights is covered in Article 67.(d). Other mechanisms for implementing the comprehensive peace process are listed in Articles 67.(e) (stopping hostilities, opening humanitarian assistance corridors, prisoner releases and exchanges), 67.(f) (amnesties for political leaders and members of armed opposition movements), and 67.(g) (accountability for crimes against humanity and war crimes and trials in national and international courts). Article 68 lists 13 \\"essential issues for peace negotiations\\". On 31 August 2020, a peace agreement was signed in Juba, South Sudan, between Sudanese authorities and rebel factions to end armed hostilities. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled to 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sudan-darfur/sudan- signs-peace-deal-with-key-rebel-groups-some-hold-out-idUKKBN25R14T A final agreement was reached in early September. This agreement stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.' Transition period protests Protests continued during the creation of the transitionary period institutions, on issues that included the nomination of a new Chief Justice of Sudan and Attorney-General, killings of civilians by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the toxic effects of cyanide and mercury from gold mining in Northern state and South Kordofan, protests against a state governor in el-Gadarif and against show trials of Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) coordinators, and for officials of the previous government to be dismissed in Red Sea and White Nile.

The stadium site was known as Husker Diamond until the 1979 season. It was renamed for Buck Beltzer after a donation from the Beltzer family allowed for the ballpark to be upgraded with an artificial turf infield, 1,000 permanent aluminum seats, covered dugouts, a press box, restrooms, and concession stands. Seating was increased to 1,500 the next year. Later upgrades included a new scoreboard in 1981; lights in 1989; and a new sound system in 1997. Also, the artificial turf was upgraded for a third time prior to the 1997 season. The stadium's 1,500 seat capacity was expanded with additional bleacher sections shipped in for NCAA Tournament games. Nebraska's five tournament games produced the stadium's five largest crowds.

He was editor-in-chief of Esquire from 2016 until 2019. A New York Times profile described him as having ‚Äúthe belletrist whimsy of Oscar Wilde and the gunslinger gusto of Wild Bill Hickok.‚Äù  Early life  Fielden was born in Odessa, Texas, the son of Billie Lu (Foreman), a ballet teacher, and Jack Fielden, a dentist. He grew up in San Antonio, where he attended Keystone School on an academic scholarship and graduated from Tom C. Clark High School. In his junior year of high school, he worked at The Polo Shop, selling clothes and later writing, ‚ÄúI loved that place. I knew that I wanted to end up in this world in some capacity.‚Äù He attended Boston University, where he met the literary critic Christopher Ricks, who became his academic adviser.  Career  = The New Yorker = Fielden got a job in the typing pool at The New Yorker shortly after he graduated in 1992. Soon after, he became an editorial assistant to Roger Angell and Daniel Menaker in the magazine's fiction department. He also worked for literary editor Bill Buford, who appointed him the department's managing editor. In 1997, Tina Brown promoted him to become the magazine's headline writer and a Talk of the Town editor. He worked on pieces with George Plimpton, Jeffrey Eugenides, Susan Orlean, D.T. Max, Alec Wilkinson, Eric Schlosser, Ingrid Sischy, Harold Brodkey, and Alison Rose. = Vogue = Fielden became the arts editor of Vogue in 2000, after spending eight years at The New Yorker. He edited food critic Jeffrey Steingarten, who won a National Magazine Award with Fielden as his editor. He was granted a rare interview with photographer Irving Penn. In 2002, he helped write and edit Vogue creative director Grace Coddington‚Äôs first book, ‚ÄúGrace: Thirty Years of Fashion at Vogue.‚Äù After Jay took a job as the editor of Town & Country, Grace had to postpone writing the book until 2011, after she decided to write the book with Michael Roberts. = Men's Vogue = In 2005, Anna Wintour chose Fielden to launch a men's spinoff of Vogue. Fielden gave the Men's Vogue the tagline, ‚ÄúStyle is How You Live,‚Äù describing the magazine in the first editor's letter, as combining ‚Äúa far-reaching curiosity about the world with an appreciation of the kind of style that emanates from accomplishment and substance.‚Äù Writing about the magazine's first issue in The New York Times, fashion critic Cathy Horyn described the magazine as ‚Äúa paean to the urbanity of The New Yorker, the glamour of Vogue and the cosmopolitan sparkle of Esquire of the late 60's and early 70's before, it seems, the world was divided into gay and straight.‚Äù Men's Vogue championed African-Americans, featuring Barack Obama on the cover twice. The magazine was a casualty of the 2009 financial crisis, and published its last issue in January of that year. = Town & Country = In 2011, Fielden became editor in chief of Town & Country. He said his goal was to bring ‚Äúa lot of people under the tent‚Äù of a ‚Äúa snooty, exclusionary magazine.‚Äù He later said, ‚ÄúI gave Town & Country some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn't always that which, well, Emily Post would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks.‚Äù In 2014, Fielden convinced novelist Jay McInerney to bring his column about wine from the Wall Street Journal to Town & Country. He inaugurated the T&C; 50 lists, including rankings of philanthropists and influential American families. In 2014, he founded the Town & Country Philanthropy Summit, which has featured speakers such as Michael Bloomberg, Chelsea Clinton, Julia Louis- Dreyfus, Bradley Cooper, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Geoffrey Canada. In 2016, Adweek wrote that Fielden had transformed the magazine from ‚Äúdusty publication to buzzy brand.‚Äù = Esquire = Fielden replaced David M. Granger as editor in chief of Esquire in 2016. In an interview with The New York Times, Fielden described his vision of the magazine: ‚ÄúThere's no cigar smoke wafting through the pages, and the obligatory three B's are gone, too ‚Äî brown liquor, boxing and bullfighting.‚Äù In October 2016, Felden published an expos√© in Esquire by journalist Christopher Glazek, chronicling how the Sackler family profited from the opioid epidemic. In March 2019, the New York Times reported, ‚ÄúWhile the drug's potential for abuse has been known for two decades, only recently has Purdue's controlling family come under intense scrutiny. Their role in marketing the drug, despite its perils, was the focus of articles in The New Yorker and Esquire in 2017.‚Äù During Felden's tenure, Esquires March 2019 cover of a Wisconsin high-school senior entitled ‚ÄúAn American Boy: What it's like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country‚Äù caused controversy. The story was posted on the magazine's website in late February 2019, prompting many Twitter users, including journalist Soledad O‚ÄôBrien and former ESPN sports journalist Jemele Hill, to criticize the magazine for putting a white teenager on the cover during Black History Month. Robyn Kanner, a self-described trans woman wrote in The New York Times: ‚ÄúOne can debate whether the article should have run a month earlier or later, or whether Esquire runs enough stories about teenage boys of color. But few if any of those criticisms actually engaged with the story itself.‚Äù Michael Brendan Dougherty, writing in the National Review, said: ‚ÄúSome of the excuses for the outrage are made up. How many women were in the decision-making process for this article? (The article's author is a woman.) ‚ÄúWhy are you centering whiteness? Are you defining American as white and male?‚Äù (It's only the first in a series looking at white, black, and LGBTQ teen subjects). ‚ÄúWhy did Esquire do this in February, which is Black History Month?‚Äù (It's the March cover subject). But March is Women's History Month! Although my favorite complaint is when people say, ‚ÄúWho thought this was a good idea?‚Äù Why isn't someone an acceptable answer? Journalist Kate Rosman posted a tweet, saying, ‚ÄúIt's a story that matters to a lot of parents of kind, empathetic boys who feel confused by society's assumptions that they're anti women/girls/LGBQT [sic], etc. becuz they're white boys with all the privilege that brings. We shouldn't say ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù about an entire demographic.‚Äù In February, 2019, the Columbia Journalism Review ran a piece questioning why Esquire did not end up publishing an expos√© on accusations of pedophilia by the director Bryan Singer. According to the two writers who reported the story, Hearst executives killed the story against Fielden's wishes. In March 2019, Fielden announced his departure from the role of editor-in-chief at Esquire. New York magazine wrote, ‚ÄúA replacement has not been named. His departure is part of what the Times calls 'a dramatic reshuffling under Troy Young,' president of Hearst Magazines as of summer 2018.‚Äù Women's Wear Daily wrote, ‚ÄúThere have been murmurs of changes at Esquire and its operations since last year, when new Hearst Magazines president Troy Young started his overhaul. Talk turned to the imminent departure of Fielden in the wake of the publicized late-stage rejection by the publisher of an investigative story on sexual misconduct allegations against the director Bryan Singer that Esquire was initially set to publish. The chatter was renewed after some public blowback for a cover story on a white, politically conservative teen.‚Äù Fielden's departure was announced through an Instagram post, in which he included a photograph of himself leaving the Hearst Building with several bags. Journalist Allana Akhtar wrote in Business Insider, \\"Chances are all of us have fantasized about quitting a job as dramatically as possible. Jay Fielden, editor-in-chief of Esquire, actually lived out his fantasy. Fielden announced his resignation on Instagram, with a photo of him clutching four bags as he left the Hearst building. He accompanied his photo with a 300-word blurb recounting his experience at the company and his plans for the future (which include cooking his kids breakfast as his wife sleeps in).\\" In a tribute to Fielden in The Cut, a fashion blog, journalist Anna Silman wrote, ‚Äú...congratulations Jay Fielden on leaving Esquire to pursue whatever your dreams are, and good luck on your future journey. I hope when I grow up I can be a fancy man just like you.‚Äù  Personal life  In 2010, Fielden's house in Connecticut, where he lives with his wife and three children, burned down. ‚ÄúYour first response is, ‚ÄòAll our stuff!‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the point is, it was oddly freeing. Subliminally, we all do things to preserve the status quo. The major lesson that has helped me as an editor is to realize not to hang on to the things that would keep you from doing something dangerous.‚Äù Fielden is a practicing Episcopalian.

He was born at Kalmthout on 21 August 1850, the son of Guillaume-Joseph Becker and Anne-Marie Anthonissen, and joined the 5th Artillery Regiment before being seconded to the Military Cartography Institute. In this capacity, he was first sent to Central Africa under Jules Ramaeckers in 1880, travelling to Karema, where he participated in the development and \\"beautification\\" of the town, and befriended both Mirambo and Tippu Tib. When Ramaeckers died on 25 February 1882, Becker was interim governor pending the arrival of Ramaeckers' official successor, √âmile Storms. After Storms' arrival, villagers under Karema's Chief, Yassagula, attacked the Belgian fort, prompting Becker to lead a counterattack with his askaris and destroy the village.Dessy, E. (1948) Biographie Coloniale Belge I. Brussels. p. 93-98. In 1884, Becker was ordered to lead an expedition to Lake Tanganyika, to link a series of captured bomas with forts he would build further inland. Although Becker intended to push as far inland as Nyangwe, on the Lualaba River, logistical problems and his own illness prevented the expedition from leaving Zanzibar until 15 May 1885, when Becker ceded command to Adolphe Durutte.Loffman, Reuben A. (2019) Church, State and Colonialism in Southeastern Congo, 1890-1962. Springer. p. 89. He returned to the Congo as a District Commissioner in 1885. Due to his pro-Zanzibari Arab sympathies, in 1889, he was sent to the Stanley Falls District of the Congo Free State to try and re-establish good relations with Tippu Tib and his Arabs, who held de facto power in the region and had been made a salaried employee of the Free State two years previously. Although he failed to make any lasting contracts with Tippu Tib,Slade, Ruth (1962) King Leopold's Congo. London: Oxford University Press he did acquire much ivory from him,Sherry, Norman (1980) Conrad's Western World. Cambridge University Press. p. 68. and taught his son Sefu bin Hamid to write Swahili in Latin script. Becker's sympathies led him to take the part of the Arabs, resulting in his fall from official favour and his resignation. He subsequently spent time staying with the Arabs, exploring the region with their trading parties, before returning to Europe in 1890 or 1891, shortly before the outbreak of the Congo Arab War. In Belgium, he was accused of cruelty towards Africans and of attempting to murder Jules Ramaeckers, but was acquitted unanimously, the latter charge being proven false by a letter sent by Ramaeckers shortly after the alleged attempted murder. He retired shortly afterwards, and spent time in Madagascar and Saint- Domingue before being appointed Inspector of Explosives at Lillo in 1902. He died in Antwerp on 30 March 1912 of a stroke caused by a fall. Becker believed that the Arab slave trade was an \\"excellent institution,\\" and that Africans were happier as slaves than they were as free men,R.

She was New Zealand's first female National Librarian, from 1976 to 1981, and the first woman in the world to head a national library. Before becoming National Librarian she was head of Dunedin Public Library, and later Auckland City Librarian.  Early life  Mary Ronnie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1926, emigrating to Dunedin, New Zealand, with her family. She attended Arthur Street School and Otago Girls' High School. In 1942 she got her first job in a library, an after-school position, in Dunedin Public Library. There she was influenced by the City Librarian, Archie Dunningham, and Dorothy Neal White (author of books on children's literature). After leaving school, she enrolled at the University of Otago but, finding university study not to her liking, she obtained a full-time job in the public library. She was to return to university later, studying part-time and gaining a Bachelor of Arts in English, philosophy and history in 1951. She completed the Certificate of the New Zealand Library Association in 1946, and in 1952 spent a year studying at the Library School in Wellington. In 1965, she completed an Master of Arts degree in history part-time, while working in the library.  Career  Dunedin Public Library 2016 Ronnie spent eight years as Head of Lending at Dunedin Public Library, a period that she regarded as one of her most productive. She gained overseas experience in branch libraries working in Glasgow for a year in 1960‚Äì61. In 1961, she became Deputy City Librarian in Dunedin, a position she held for eight years, succeeding Ada Fache in 1968 to become City Librarian. During her eight years in the latter position, she oversaw the building of a new library in Dunedin. In 1976, Ronnie moved to Wellington to become National Librarian after being encouraged by colleagues to take up the position. Ronnie took early retirement from the National Library in 1981; she would have had to retire in 1986 as the government service stipulated retirement at age 60. Her early retirement was prompted by her marriage to Peter O'Connor, an associate professor of history at the University of Auckland, and her move to live in Auckland. Also, preparations were underway to build a new National Library, and she felt that the planning for the new building should be done by someone who would work in the building long-term. Auckland City Library 2008 After moving to Auckland, Ronnie became Auckland City Librarian from 1982 to 1984. In 1987, she joined the Graduate Department of Librarianship, Archives and Records at Monash University in Melbourne, serving as Head of Department and Acting Professor of the Department from 1989 to 1992. From 1973 to 1974, Ronnie was president of the New Zealand Library Association. She also served on the University of Otago Council from 1974 to 1975. Ronnie also wrote about libraries. Her writings included: * a history of Otago and Southland libraries * a history of Wellington Public Libraries * histories of Dunedin Public Library * the National Library Act 1965 * regional library services * education for librarianship Ronnie has expressed her optimism about the future of public libraries both as a resource of printed materials but also for the opportunities afforded by digital technologies. She has been a champion for public libraries as focal points in their communities, advocating that they be located where people are. She has likened them to supermarkets with self- service and labelled items but with the additional feature of help when customers need it. In awarding her an honorary doctorate, David Skegg, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, recognised her commitment to high quality and accessible library services, her leadership in the library profession and her scholarship.  Honours and awards  In the 1982 Queen's Birthday Honours, Ronnie was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. She was conferred an honorary Doctorate of Literature (LittD) by the University of Otago in 2007, and received a Dunedin Public Libraries Citation in 2007.

Snow was born in La Salle, Illinois, the third child of Norman G. Snow and Charlotte D. (n√©e Warner). At the age of sixteen she left La Salle to enter Hungerford Collegiate Institute, Adams, New York. After graduating in 1880, she returned home to live with her parents, then in 1884 matriculated to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. While an undergraduate, she joined the Kappa Alpha Theta fraternity. When the Sigma Xi honor society was formed at Cornell in 1886, Julia joined along with fellow Theta Anna Botsford Comstock. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1888. Returning to Cornell for graduate studies, Julia was awarded a M.S. degree in 1889 with a thesis titled Sphaerella Fragariae: A Fungus Disease of the Strawberry Plant. She spent a year teaching botany in Eau Claire, Wisconsin at the Hardy Preparatory School, then for a year at Coates College for Women in Terre Haute, Indiana. Julia Snow became one of the first recipients of an Association of College Alumnae fellowship, and used it to study at Zurich in Europe during 1891‚Äì92. A WEA fellowship the following year allowed her to complete her Ph.D. program. She graduated with a thesis titled Conductive Tissue of the Monocotyledonous Plants. During the period 1894‚Äì96, she taught science at the American College for Girls in Constantinople. She studied research training at the University of G√∂ttingen and completed some post-graduate studies at the University of Basel. By 1898 she had returned to the U.S. with a fellowship at the University of Michigan, where she taught botany until 1900. In 1901 she was named head of the Biology Department at Rockford College. During the summers of 1898‚Äì1901 she worked with the U.S. Fish Commission to perform a biological survey of Lake Erie. She joined the staff of Smith College in 1901 as an assistant in the biology department. Dr. Snow was promoted to instructor in 1902, and became the first at the college to teach courses in bacteriology. In 1906 she was named associate professor. She spent the remainder of her life at Northampton, Massachusetts. Dr. Snow was noted for her international travels. During the 1890s she journeyed alone from Constantinople to Russia. She spent considerable time in China and India, pursuing her interests in regional art and architecture, and circling the world twice. Her scientific research was focused on plant conductive tissues and fresh water algae, with several papers published during 1899‚Äì1912.

Her father was an itinerant reporter; her mother played piano in a movie theater and painted china for sale. She attended Hasbrouck Heights High School. At age 18 she was a hostess at a Schrafft's restaurant in New York and dreamed of being a dining-room hostess on cruise ships.  Career  At age 16, Godfrey began broadcasting at a small radio station in New Jersey. Her career was interrupted in 1931 when she contracted polio and had to spend a year in a hospital. When she recovered sufficiently, she took classes to prepare herself for a return to radio. She had her own program in Rochester, Minnesota, followed by stints on KRDO in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and on KPHO in Phoenix, Arizona. While in Phoenix, she also broadcast on KPHO-TV, at one point having three programs on the two stations. Godfrey moved to ABC-TV in 1953 to become host of Up for Adoption, which debuted on 20 stations on January 16, 1954. On July 26 of that year, she began a five-minute news program on WPIX television in New York. Also in 1954, she was host of On Your Way, a quiz program on ABC-TV on which she interviewed people who had an urgent need for money to go somewhere. Contestants who answered questions correctly received the money that they needed. Newspaper Enterprise Association columnist Dick Kleiner described the program as \\"a poor show\\", the format of which once changed twice in three weeks. Godfrey herself later referred to the show as \\"the worst.\\" In 1955, Godfrey was host of The Kathy Godfrey Show, a weekly 25-minute variety program on CBS Radio. That program ended on May 19, 1956, replaced by This Is Kathy Godfrey, a daily interview program, beginning on May 21, 1956, also on CBS.

Biography Tadeusz Puder was born in a Jewish family. At the age of 9, he was baptized. Puder attended the Adam Mickiewicz State Junior High School. In 1928, he joined to the Archdiocesan Seminary of Warsaw. On October 18, 1932, he was ordained priest. Then he studied theology and was envoyed to the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. In 1937 Puzer started to work at the parish in Rzeczyca. Then he was transferred to the parish of Saint James the Apostle in Warsaw. In June 1938 he was appointed rector - vicar of the Saint Hyacinth in Warsaw. Puzer replaced Stanis≈Çaw Trzeciak, a well-known priest of National Democracy in Poland. From that moment on, he became the subject of a campaign of hatred on the part of the extreme right wing, and indignation aroused of his Jewish origin of Pudra. On July 3, 1938, a few weeks after the appointment, priest Puder was slapped during the mass by a man who shouted, \\"This is a Jew!\\". The perpetrator was detained and battered by the faithful. The beating caused controversy. Catholic press (Voice of the Nation and Small Journal) condemned the assault. The national press (Prosto z mostu) blamed the Catholic Church for the incident which, according to journalists, should not appoint people of Jewish origin to priests, because a person who \\"grew up in a Jewish atmosphere\\" can not be Polish, even if he was baptized. After the outbreak of the war, priest Puder left Warsaw. He worked in Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka in the chapel of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary who ran the orphanage. On April 24, 1941, after the denunciation of priest Stanis≈Çaw Trzeciak, Puder was arrested by the Gestapo on charges of not carrying out the armband, which, according to German decrees, should be worn by all Jews. On September 1, 1941, he was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison. Due to the deteriorating state of health he went to the prison hospital, from where, thanks to the help of nuns, he managed to escape on November 12, 1942.

Israeli- Palestinian peace initiative helped resolve Temple Mount standoff, by Kobi Nachshoni, ynetnews.com, July 27, 2017. The idea for this group originated from a meeting in 2002 chaired by Melchior along with Palestinian Sheikh Talal Sider, in Alexandria, Egypt, co-sponsored by the Mufti of Egypt, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque, and Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar University, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi; Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey; and Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, Israel's Chief Rabbi. This summit launched the Alexandria Process, and brought together religious leaders to adopt common principles aimed at mediating the conflicts in the region, and to seek common ground to promote resolution of the conflicts. Melchior established the Mosaica Center for Interreligious Cooperation ‚Äì MERPI (Middle East Religious Peace Initiative) to promote implementation of the principles of the Alexandria Declaration.

He also wrote under the pseudonym Olivier Tolc√®s. Pain was born in Troyes in April 1845 to a banker, but was raised in Normandy, where he studied law. At the same time, he attended radical student circles, and began to write for newspapers such as La Marseillaise and Henri Rochefort's La Lanterne, earning himself his first conviction. During his sentence, he was imprisoned in Sainte-P√©lagie Prison alongside Rochefort, who he befriended. He took part in the Paris Commune of 1871, becoming Paschal Grousset's \\"Chief of Staff for External Relations\\". He was noted for his highly radical positions, even among the Communards, invoking \\"eye for an eye\\" against government officials. During the Bloody Week, the military assault which ended the Commune, he was wounded at a water tower barricade, but managed to escape before being arrested in Rouen on 27 July 1871.Butterworth, Alex (2010) The World That Never Was: A True Story of Dreamers, Schemers, Anarchists and Secret Agents. Random House. An 1879 caricature of Pain from Hommes d'aujourd'hui. Pain was sentenced to deportation to New Caledonia, where he was soon joined by Rochefort, Grousset, and Fran√ßois Jourde. Eventually, in 1874, these three prisoners, alongside two others, managed to escape New Caledonia by swimming to a whaling boat which allowed them to board, then fleeing to Australia and splitting up: Pain and Rochefort travelled to the United States and then London, arriving on 18 June 1874. Their escape was the only successful one in the history of New Caledonia as a French penal colony, and made headlines in France, as well as being the subject of a Manet painting.Duret, Theodore (1947) Manet and the French Impressionists. p. 256. Pain quickly got back into contact with the French Press, and in 1877 he was dispatched to report on the Russo-Turkish War for La Lanterne. Bluffing his way into Plevna without a firman from the Ottoman Sultan giving him permission to be there, Pain managed to befriend Osman Nuri Pasha, and was present in the city throughout the siege and at its capture by the Russians, as a consequence spending the rest of the war imprisoned.Snodgrass, Ryan Charles & Sandes, John (1897) Under the red crescent: adventures of an English surgeon with the Turkish army at Plevna and Erzeroum, 1877‚Äì1878. New York: Scribner. pp. 192‚Äì. In 1880, he was finally able to return to France due to a general amnesty for communards. In early 1884, Pain was given a commission from Le Figaro to travel to the Sudan and report on the Mahdist Revolt. With letters of introduction and travel help from JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´, Pain was the only one of a party of other radicals including James O'Kelly to make it to the Sudan (the others being arrested),O'Sullivan, Niamh (2010) Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire. Field Day Publications. p. 123‚Äì126. . arriving at El Obeid on 15 August 1884. There, he pledged his loyalty to the Mahdi, supposedly in the name of France. The Sudanese, however, distrusted Pain and regarded him as an English spy, and he later admitted that he was really in the Sudan to write up an account of the Mahdi and his empire for Rochefort.Ohrwalder, Joseph & Wingate, Reginald (1892) Ten Years' Captivity in the Mahdi's Camp. London: Low. p. 174‚Äì175. As the Mahdi was not present at El Obeid, Pain was allowed to go to him at Busata, where he again claimed that he was there \\"to lay before [him] the submission of the French nation\\". The Mahdi did not believe him either, and ordered him to be guarded and allowed to speak to nobody. He was then taken with the Mahdi to Shatt, but on the way he developed a fever and caught dysentery, falling from his camel on 15 November 1884. The Sudanese, assuming he was dead, buried him in the sand, but Joseph Ohrwalder thought it was \\"quite possible\\" that he was not dead. After Pain's death, Rochefort insinuated that he had been executed by Herbert Kitchener under the orders of Lord Wolseley, causing a minor diplomatic incident and endangering the lives of British diplomats in Paris.Newton, Baron Thomas Wodehouse Legh & Ward, Josephine Mary (1913) Lord Lyons: A Record of British Diplomacy.

(May 15, 1780 ‚Äì November 25, 1827) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit, who ministered throughout Maryland and became the president of Georgetown College. Descending from one of the original Catholic settlers of the British Maryland Province, he studied at Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. Like his brother and future bishop, Benedict Joseph Fenwick, he entered the priesthood, studying at St. Mary's Seminary, before entering the Society of Jesus, which was suppressed at the time. He was made rector of St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral in Baltimore by Archbishop John Carroll, and remained in the position for ten years. Near the end of his pastorate, he was also made vicar general of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, which involved traveling to say Mass in remote parishes throughout rural Maryland. In 1820, Fenwick reluctantly accepted his appointment as president of Georgetown College. While he made some improvements to the curriculum, his presidency was considered unsuccessful due to declining enrollment and mounting debt. In August 1825, he effectively abandoned the post, leaving the provincial superior, who spoke little English, to manage the institution. Two years later, he died at Georgetown.  Early life  Enoch Fenwick was born on May 15, 1780, in St. Mary's County, Maryland, one of four brothers, three of whom would become priests. He descended from one of the original Catholic settlers of the Maryland Province, Cuthbert Fenwick. One of his brothers was Benedict Joseph Fenwick, who became the Bishop of Boston and a president of Georgetown College. Another brother, George Fenwick, also entered the priesthood, while another brother did not enter religious life. Fenwick enrolled at Georgetown College in 1793, which he attended until 1797. The president, William Dubourg, identified him as the best student in the college, and appointed him in 1797 to teach rudiments to the young students in the lower school. He then entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore in 1805. The following year, he entered the Society of Jesus on October 10, becoming a member of the first class in the Jesuit novitiate at Georgetown, and one of four who were the first Jesuits ordained priests in the United States. As the Jesuit order had been officially suppressed by Pope Clement XIV, Fenwick was admitted to the Corporation of Catholic Clergymen, the civil corporation that sought to preserve the Society and its property until its restoration by Pope Pius VII in 1815. He was ordained a priest on March 12, 1808, in Georgetown, by Bishop Leonard Neale. = Ministry in Baltimore = Following his ordination, he was made assistant to the Archbishop of Baltimore, John Carroll. Upon the death of Francis Beeston in 1809, Fenwick was appointed by Carroll as rector of St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral in Baltimore, where he raised money for the construction of a new St. Peter's church building. He oversaw work that began in 1806 and continued until 1812, before being halted by the War of 1812. Construction resumed in 1815, and was completed in 1821. Fenwick held the position of rector until 1820, when he was succeeded by James Whitfield. From 1809 to 1815, he also served on the Board of Directors of Georgetown College. Simultaneous with his rectorship, in 1819, he became vicar general for the Archdiocese of Baltimore. In this position, he served as chaplain in Port Tobacco, Maryland, where he said Mass every other Sunday. He was also required to travel to three others parishes throughout Charles County (in Lower Zacchia, Upper Zacchia, and Pomfret) every other Sunday, because they had been abandoned by a priest who returned to England. He was considered on several occasions for being raised to the episcopate, specifically as Bishop of Louisiana and the Two Floridas or Bishop of Detroit. He was also considered by Bishop Edward Fenwick for being made the coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Cincinnati.  Georgetown College  alt=Georgetown University campus in 1828 The Jesuit visitor to the United States, Peter Kenney, recommended to Archbishop Ambrose Mar√©chal of Baltimore that Fenwick be appointed president of Georgetown College in the summer of 1820. This recommendation heeded, he was informed that he would be named to the office in August of that year, and his term officially began on September 16, 1820. He assumed the office very reluctantly from Anthony Kohlmann, who quit the presidency to establish the Washington Seminary. Resenting his transfer from the cathedral in Baltimore to Georgetown, Fenwick viewed the college as having \\"one foot in the grave of disgrace\\" and little prospect for recovery. Overall, Fenwick's administration of the college was evaluated by Stephen Larigaurdelle Dubuisson, a subsequent president of Georgetown, as \\"wretched.\\" The size of the student body declined, due to the opening of Columbian College and the Washington Seminary nearby, and the college's debts grew, as he viewed pursuing parents for overdue tuition and board distasteful during the economic recession. The reputation of the school suffered due to this. Fenwick attempted to offset this decline by publishing a new prospectus and placing advertisements in newspapers. His administration was markedly hands-off, as he allowed the prefect of studies, Roger Baxter, to manage most of the affairs of the school. Baxter was known for his liberal attitude toward student discipline and in his own consumption of alcohol and alleged unaccompanied visitation of women in the City of Washington; Baxter was later deported to Europe by the provincial superior, Francis Dzierozynski. Despite these deficiencies, Fenwick undertook several reforms of the curriculum. He divided the year into two semesters, and definitively prescribed the course of study as including one class of rudiments, three in grammar, one in humanities, and one in rhetoric. Each professor also taught Ancient Greek, French, Latin, and English in their classes. The first college journal, called The Minerva, was also circulated. Printing presses were not available to the school, so it was written in manuscript form, and lasted for only a few issues. The college's library saw substantial growth during his tenure, and he personally donated a number of books. In August 1825, without resigning the office, he left the college, effectively leaving Dzierozynski, who spoke little English and was unfamiliar with American ways, in charge. He was officially replaced by Benedict Fenwick later that year, who resumed the office in an acting capacity. Enoch Fenwick died on November 25, 1827, at Georgetown College, and was buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery.

Background Kurdiya was a member of the House of Mihran, one of the seven Great Houses of Iran. The family was of Parthian origin, and was centered in Ray, south of Tehran, the capital of present-day Iran. Her father was Bahram Gushnasp, a military officer who had fought the Byzantines and campaigned in Yemen during the reign of Khosrow I (). Her grandfather Gurgin Milad had served as the marzban (general of a frontier province, \\"margrave\\") of Armenia from 572 to 574. Kurdiya had three siblings whom were Korduya, Mardansina and most notably, Bahram Chobin, whom she married.; It is however not known if she and Bahram were full siblings.  Biography  In 590, Bahram mounted a large- scale rebellion against the Sasanian family, forcing the newly ascended ruler Khosrow II to flee, while taking the throne for himself. He was the following year defeated and killed. Not long after, Khosrow II's uncle Vistahm rebelled against him, carving a principality for himself in the entire eastern and northern quadrants of the Iranian realm. It was during this period that he married Kurdiya , consequently increasing his status. His rebellion, however, also proved unsuccessful; according to some accounts, he was killed by Hephthalite subject Pariowk, whilst an alternative account states that it was Gordiya who killed him after being given the promise of marriage in return by Khosrow II. The 9th-century historian Dinawari mentioned a son of Kurdiya and Khosrow, named Juvansher, as reigning as monarch of Iran briefly in 630. This king however remains obscure, and none of his coins have yet been found.

It trapped 108 miners in the section 8 of the mine. The miners suffocated. The only way to stop the fire was to seal the section from oxygen (around midnight). The chance of surviving in the sealed section was zero at the time of the seal. A total of 750 rescue workers assisted in the rescue operation. After the tragedy, all local mines switched to fire-proof belts in conveyors (in addition to other changes made).

Four moderate-large earthquakes devastated towns and villages across the central Italian peninsula, with damage even reported in Rome. These earthquakes originated from the Apennine fold and thrust belt fault network, with the first and most destructive shock's epicenter originating from the north-west Campania region. Paleoseimological data gathered from scarping, fault length, and collapsed sections of Venafro's Roman aqueduct indicates the epicenter of the main shock was likely along the Aquae Iuliae fault. The fault suspected of causing this earthquake occurred on the Aqua Iuliae fault along the Molise- Campania border.  Earthquakes  The first earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 6.7, struck on 9 September in the north-west Campania southeast of the Molisano town of Venafro. The second quake struck on 10 of September near L'Aquila. Both quakes caused widespread damage to not just towns and cities but infrastructure like Roman aqueducts and bridges. The poet Petrarch describes damage in Rome to the city's monuments. The western side of the four-story Flavian Amphitheatre collapsed towards the caelian hills, leaving a massive mound of travertine and tufa rubble Rome later quarried for construction materials.

Both statues stand with their backs to the sea looking south to Table Mountain. The statue was donated by Cecil Rhodes to the city of Cape Town. He paid the Scottish sculptor John Tweed the princely sum of ¬£1,000 for the work, partly on the condition that the statue not show Tweed's name and be larger than life-size. The statue lies on a Cape granite pedestal 4¬º m high designed by an architect friend of Tweed's. This further inflated the cost. On 18 May 1899, Cape Town Mayor Thomas Ball unveiled the bronze statue in the presence of the entire City Council, national politicians, and members of the public, but in the absence of Rhodes, then sojourning in Europe. Rhodes chose to situate the statue where Van Riebeeck set foot ashore. Due to the development of the harbour and the city's growth, the statue has been overshadowed by skyscrapers. Over time, a large roundabout was developed at the site, once called Heerengracht, and in 1969, a statue of Maria van Riebeeck was laid to the right of her husband's. There is no image that can be said to certainly depict the founder of the Cape refreshment station. In the statue, Van Riebeeck's sword is sheathed, and he carries his walking stick in his right hand. The dress in the statue is historically inaccurate. Overhanging shoulder straps were out of fashion in the mid-17th century, and knee breeches and the jacker Van Riebeeck is wearing only became popular after his departure for Java. Hat feathers were in fashion, but are missing in the statue. Each year on 6 April, Founders Day, wreaths were laid at the statues of Jan and Maria van Riebeeck. In his poem, \\"Oor monnemente gepraat\\" (\\"speaking of monuments\\"), Peter Blum writes: > here is Jan van Riebeeck, very handsome in his plus fours; .... In Van Riebeeck's birthplace of Culemborg is a bust of Van Riebeeck, donated by the Cape Town City Council.  Bibliography  * Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, vol. 11.

Its site is located near Aƒüras, in Asiatic Turkey. Pisidia was known for not being able to grow many crops, as they had seasonal droughts and, living inland, could not dig irrigation canals from the Mediterraenean Sea. Pisidia eventually collapsed after a trade route connecting them to other cities was entirely captured by bandits. This proved a problem for the Pisideans. They had deposits of marble and copper near their city and they traded them for crops each year along their sole trade route. When bandits controlled this trade route, all of the marble and copper was usually stolen and the poor merchant was left at the entrance to Pisidia, normally unconscious or dead. Once the Pisideans no longer had any source of food sustainable to feed their city, most Pisideans fled the city in search of new homes. The remaining Pisideans tried to hunt the small supplies of rabbits and elk in the area, but the animals spooked quickly and there was not enough kill for the remaining peoples. The bandits had been scouting the city for a while and once they decided that there were not enough original Pisideans left to put up resistance, the bandits came into the town and rebuilt it. They had the original Pisideans who were still left sign a treaty which said that the remaining Pisideans would not leave the new city, now called Agrae, but would be granted the freedoms of servants, and, depending on how well behaved they were, could sometimes be granted lower class citizen freedoms.. However, the bandits were in a predicament. There were not enough bandits to keep having enough offspring to sustain their new city and grow the population. And even if there were, most of the bandits were men, and there were very few women in the group. However, the remaining original Pisideans were mostly unmarried women who had no obligation to a husband to flee with him to a new city. So the bandits also added to a treaty that said that all women from the original city would have to immediately marry a bandit or they would be killed or driven out of the city. The Pisideans agreed to this, and the bandits actually brought the new city of Agrae to prosper. The new king of Agrae was a former bandit named Cyrillus. Most rulers of that time period would name their domains or cities after themselves, but Cyrillus did not. After the treaty between the bandits and the Pisideans, Cyrillus married a Pisidean woman named Eutropia Galene. Cyrillus decided to change her name to Agrape, meaning love, and Cyrillus actually built a temple to her at the heart of the city. He named the city Agrae after her, and Agrape was venerated as a goddess on earth at the command of Cyrillus. Agrape became the goddess of Agrae, but she was only venerated inside of the city and its territory. After Cyrillus and Agrape had both passed away, Agrape started being the goddess of other things in Agrae. She replaced Aphrodite as the goddess of love and pleasure, replaced Hestia as the goddess of hearth and home, and replaced Hera as the goddess of marriage and women. A large differing between the religions of Agrae and surrounding Greek poleis is that the entire story of Persephone and Hades was replaced to fit Agrape and Cyrillus.  The myth of Agrape and Cyrillus  The myth created around Agrape and Cyrillus is a replacement of the myth of Persephone and Hades. In the myth, Cyrillus is a mortal form of Hades, the god of the underworld and death. In Agrean mythology, Hades was not the grim and evil god of normal Greek mythology. He was instead a hopeless romantic forever searching for love. No god had any interest in him unless they needed to do something with one of the dead. Hades had tried to find a lover in one of the dead, but there were none suitable for him. One day, he heard about a beautiful lady in the city of Pisidia named Agrape, who was loved by all but had rejected all of her suitors saying that she knew the perfect one was coming, but he was not here yet. (Notice how the myth is different from history, saying that while Pisidia was the name of the city, Agrape was her name, while in reality, her name changed to Agrape once the bandits conquered the city.) Hades knew Agrape had to be his perfect lover and took a mortal form to persuade her to come to the underworld with him. This mortal form was named Cyrillus. Cyrillus ventured to the city to find Agrape and immediately was found by Agrape, who said, \\"I could feel your love for me as soon as you entered the city! We must marry immediately!\\" Cyrillus was overjoyed at Agrape having feelings for him so soon and agreed. After they wed, Cyrillus told Agrape who he really was, Hades, the god of the underworld and the dead. Agrape had heard the stories about Hades forever searching for his perfect lover, and she was even more endeared to him when she found out that she was that perfect lover. Eventually, Cyrillus and Agrape became king and queen of the city, which Cyrillus renamed Agrae after his wife. They had five children. Their first child was named Alexandria, and she became the head priestess to the temple of Agrape in real life and in this myth. Their second child was named Arcadius, and he became the king after his father passed away. Their last three children were all female, and they followed the lead of their older sister Alexandria and became priestesses to Agrape's temple. Praxiaya, the youngest sibling, was the priestess who brought all of the townspeople to believe in these changed myths, mostly because she had affairs with most of them and brought them to the temple with her. The other two siblings are mostly unimportant and had nothing worthy of mention other than being in the royal family. Their names were Avilia and Distronimya. Now in the myth, eventually Zeus found out about Hades' affair with a mortal, and was not pleased. One day when Agrape was picking grapes in the fields, Zeus sent a lightning bolt right at her and she died. However, Cyrillus had heard the lighting bolt's collision and ran over to the noise. When he found his precious wife dead he collapsed into tears. However, Cyrillus still had some magic in him, being a mortal form of Hades, and he willingly used all of the magic left within him to turn Agrape's soul into a god. However, after expending all of his magic, Cyrillus died. As he went back to the underworld, he found Agrape there waiting for him. He was overjoyed to find out that his magic had worked and that Agrape could live with him forever now, since Agrape was now an immortal god. However, Zeus was even more enraged by Agrape becoming a god and was preparing to smite the city of Agrae. Hades could not protect the city, as he had to regain his former magics by sitting in the underworld for a while, so Agrape decided to use her newfound godly powers to protect the city and all that she loved in it. At this moment, Arcadius was being crowned king, and Agrape appearing as a goddess in the sky above them was considered an amazing providence that she was there to watch her son become coronated. Agrape put a magical barrier over the city and as the citizens watched her protect them from Zeus's lightning bolts, they declared her the goddess of the city. Agrape forever watches over the city from the underworld with her husband, as the myth ends.

The Army Air Forces in World War II: Combat Chronology, 1941-1945 The bombing commenced at 23:34, with primary aiming point being the intersection of Japan National Route 248 with Gifu Prefectural Road 54. Due to the flat topography of the city and ideal weather conditions, the incendiary bombing created a firestorm which destroyed most of the center of the city, including the Gifu Prefectural Office, Gifu Station, and numerous other train stations and factories.Bradley. No Strategic Targets Left. The attack concluded at 0:20 AM the following morning. In total, 421.4 tons of E-46 and 477.4 tons E-47 incendiary bombs were dropped on the city. Efforts by citizens and civil defense authorities to extinguish the napalm-filled bomblets using traditional water bucket brigades contributed to the casualties and extent of damage. Due to the topography of Gifu city center and the weather conditions at that time, the damage per bomb dropped was huge. The affected area was around fix square kilometers. The air raid killed 818 civilians, and injured 1059, with 20,363 homes totally destroyed, rendering 100,000 people effectively homeless.

It is native to the southeastern United States, where it grows in habitats where soil is poor in nutrition. Description The plant grows as a small rosette of leaves, which rarely get larger than 3/4 of an inch (20mm) across. The leaves have inward curling margins, and the upper surface is covered in numerous tiny hairs with glands at their tip which secrete small drops of mucilage. The plant produces single white to pale violet flowers on the ends of stalks about 6-8 inches (150-200 mm) high. Like all butterworts, the flowers are zygomorphic, and have a spur extending from the back of the flower. Carnivory Insects can become trapped in the numerous sticky glads that cover the leaves, and the plant will secrete enzymes to digest them. Over time, the plant assimilates organic nitrogen and other nutrients from the decaying insect into its own tissues. Habitat The plant can be found growing in moist, sandy soil in pinelands and savannas, from the southeastern US, into the great plains to Oklahoma.

Additional Productions: multiple musicals produced by the Broadway Across America touring company; the White Oak Dance Project in 1993 produced by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mark Morris (choreographer); and various other plays and performances. After the Eccles Theater was built and opened in 2016 just around the corner on Main Street in Salt Lake City, some productions moved from the Capitol Theater to take advantage of the larger stage and more modern sound system of Eccles Theater. Capitol Theater is managed by the Salt Lake County Center for the Arts.  Renovations  The Capitol Theater has undergone multiple renovations over the course of its history. Damaged by a fire in 1949, there was not a major renovation until 1975, funded through an $8.6 million county bond. Extensive renovations were made to the building and auditorium, making it one of the premier performing arts centers in downtown Salt Lake City. In 2013, the Theater began a major renovation, budgeting $32 million for renovations to the building and adding the Jessie Eccles Quinney Ballet Centre next to the Capitol Theater, expanding lobby space, as well as constructing new rehearsal space, costume space, and administrative offices for the Salt Lake City-based Ballet West dance company. In 2019, the theater auditorium began a six-month renovation removing all the seats on the floor of the main auditorium and replacing the floor and adding seats that accommodate ADA seating, replace narrower seats. As well, the plans include adding a new sound system, replacing building infrastructure, and restoring the roof to the original terra cotta fa√ßade. This renovation was a second phase of planned work in 2013, when the orchestra pit, backstage/downstairs, and the stage itself were improved.

He was also a teacher and focused primarily on Japanese immigrant students. Some sources erroneously give his place of birth as Bandar, India. Biography His father, Reinier Tadama (1844-1879) was a colonial administrator in Aceh. His mother was his father's mistress; a local woman. He was orphaned when his father died of tuberculosis while at a health spa in Germany. @ Ancestry.com, Message BoardsHaving been taken to the Netherlands, he remained there and received his first artistic training from the landscape painter, Sieger Jan Baukema (1852-1936). Later, he attended the \\"Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten\\" in Amsterdam. In 1895, he married Thamine Tadama- Groeneveld, who was also a painter. In 1897, they settled in Egmond aan den Hoef and became part of the , led by George Hitchcock.Biography @ the Cascadia Art Museum. They both specialized in seascapes. In 1898, they had a joint exhibition at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in Paris. By now, the critics had come to consider Thamine as the better artist and Fokko worked mostly as her assistant. In 1900, he gave up painting; devoting his time to hunting and caring for his large dog kennel. In 1907, they relocated to Katwijk aan Zee. The progress of their relationship after that is unclear. Some sources say that she became mentally unsound and had to be institutionalized by 1910, but others indicate that she was exhibiting and winning awards as late as 1912.Dutch Wikipedia. Yet others say she accompanied her husband to Seattle and returned to the Netherlands after his death. It can be assumed there were some clashes regarding their competing careers. Whatever the truth may be, in 1910 he emigrated to the United States, crossed the country, settled in Seattle and began painting again. In 1913, he held his first showing in one of the meeting rooms at the Seattle Public Library. The following year, he started his own art school. Perhaps because his name could be mistaken for Japanese, he soon became a mentor and patron for many Japanese immigrant artists, including Kenjiro Nomura, Yasushi Tanaka and Shimizu Toshi, as well as the photographer, Soichi Sunami. He apparently had a very successful career, until the beginning of the Great Depression virtually destroyed the local demand for art. To make ends meet, he found employment as a mural painter with the WPA; taking part in the Federal Art Projects. Broke, despondent and in declining health, he committed suicide in 1937.

The fire was reported on July 1, 2014 and was contained on July 10, after burning and an estimated . The fire, dubbed after Butts Canyon in the Pope Valley area, threatened more than 300 homes at its peak, and lead to the closure of Butts Canyon Road. The cause of the Butts fire remains under investigation. The fire also subsequently destroyed 2 homes, 7 outbuildings and killed 2 civilians. At the fires peak, 1,682 fire personnel, 101 fire engines, 60 fire crews, 10 bulldozers, nine helicopters, and four air tankers were battling the inferno. Events The fire broke out at around 12:40 pm on Tuesday, July 1, near Butts Canyon and Oak Valley road and within an hour had crossed both ends of the valley along the road. Over 1,000 firefighters had been deployed to the fire by late Tuesday evening, as it had ballooned from an estimated 500 acres to over 2,700 acres. The fire continued to burn in a predominantly northern direction as Butts Canyon Road was closed to the public. On Wednesday, July 2, Governor Jerry Brown announced that he has secured federal funds from a FEMA grant to help fire departments cover the cost of battling the blaze, which had by that point destroyed seven structures and was 30% contained. Later that day, the Butts fire had grown to 3,800 acres as containment was still stagnant at 30% while over 380 structures were under mandatory threat. CAL FIRE made note that the Butts fire had been the most significant wildfire to burn in the state in weeks during that summer. By early Thursday, July 3, the fire had continued to spread in largely rural parts of both Napa and Lake County, leading to further evacuations that had now included portions of the Lake county area. After significant burn-off operations Thursday and later Friday, July 4, containment lines on the Butts fire grew to 65% as the forward progress of the fire was halted at 4,300 acres. By this time, seven outbuildings and two single family homes had been destroyed. On July 10, the fire had remained the same acreage as it was fully contained by firefighters. Fatalities The skeletal remains of two bodies were discovered by concrete workers driving along Butt Canyon Road in the spring of March 2016. It would take several months before the bodies would be identified as that of Santa Rosa brothers Mario and Florentino Avendano who had been reported missing in the area. The brothers were first reported missing in January 2015, more than seven months following the events of the Butts fire. It is believed the two died while attempting to flee during the early hours of the fire and became entrapped.

It took him eight years to complete the design of this pistol and obtain both the British and Austrian patent for it. He started his own company to manufacture the pistols and called it Wiener Waffenfabrik which translates as Vienna Firearms Works in partnership with a man named Camillo Frank and began production of pistols in both .25 ACP and .32 ACP around 1909. Sales were quite slow but Tomiska continued to work on refining his designs and obtaining additional patents, finally selling his business in 1919 and moving back to his native Czechoslovakia where he worked for Jihoceska Zbrojovka (South Czech Weapon Works) which later became a part of ƒåesk√° zbrojovka (CZ).

It originally carried both the railway and a roadway, but the railway has now closed. Description Carron Bridge is located near the town of Carron, in Moray, Scotland. The main span, a segmental arch, is supported by three cast iron ribs, each cast in seven parts and bolted together, with masonry flood arches on each bank, which have spans of . The spandrels linking the main arch to the carriageways are composed of delicate cast iron lattice work. At either end are abutment piers of rustic ashlar, protected by triangular cutwaters. History The bridge was constructed between 1862 and 1863 by engineer Alexander Gibb of the Great North of Scotland Railway, and ironfounders William McKinnon and Co. It was the last cast iron railway bridge to be built in Scotland and was also the last to be used by railway traffic. When the Strathspey line closed in 1968, the railway tracks adjoining the road were removed. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1987. Proposals were put forward in 1993 to replace the bridge with a steel structure. Historic Scotland successfully objected to these, and the original structure was preserved and renovated to include the current single-lane road with adjoining footpath.

Biography Eligio Esquivel M√©ndez was born in M√©rida, Yucat√°n. He studied at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he earned a civil engineering degree in 1933. He was selected by president L√°zaro C√°rdenas to head a commission providing technical support to various Latin American countries. While working with the commission, he was honored by the government of Bolivia upon the completion of the dam creating La Angostura Lake in the Cochabamba Department of that country. He directed the construction of the Morelos and Matamoros dams in Mexico. In 1943, he assumed management of the Colorado River Irrigation District, a position he held until 1957. He also participated in the construction of the Matamoros and Galeana reservoirs. He was elected as the second governor of the state of Baja California and took office in November 1959. Esquivel was a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and was backed by term-limited incumbent governor Braulio Maldonado. The election was marked by protests as members of the opposition party, the National Action Party (PAN), accused the PRI of vote rigging. As governor, he made efforts to revitalize the border town of Tijuana, which had gained a reputation for vice. He was also known for his work with hydraulic infrastructure, which addressed the serious problem of soil salinization in the Mexicali Valley. He died in office of an apparent heart attack while visiting El Centro, California and was succeeded by interim governor Gustavo Aubanel Vallejo.

History  During the regime of Pervez Musharraf (October 1999 to August 2008) in Pakistan, a devolution plan was introduced under which local governments were established in 2001 across the country. Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) Devolution Support Project (CDSP) had been working in Punjab Province since July 2003 to September 2008 to strengthen the devolution process and the new local government system in the province. One of CDSP interventions in this regard had been the establishment of an Association of local governments in the province. CDSP started the process of formulation of LCA in September 2004. After analyzing the situation of informal alliances and networks in Pakistan, CDSP and all other stakeholders came to the conclusion that the idea of establishing an association has to be a unique one that incorporates all local government stakeholders in it. The establishment process had its origins in a series of discussions and consultations to design an institution that can serve the local needs. In a local elected representatives‚Äô conference they decided to proceed with urgency to create a provincial local government Association. Since then extensive outreach was undertaken among elected officials and an Interim Joint Committee (IJC) was formed with a mandate to begin engagement with Districts, Provincial and Federal Governments on local governments‚Äô priority issues. In December 2005, a study tour to the Philippines and Thailand was undertaken to expose IJC members and appropriate Provincial Government officials to the functioning and experiences of local government associations in those two countries. A major step in the LCA development process was the formation of the IJC to model the structure, functioning and relations of the formal Association to be. During the next few months, extensive outreach was undertaken in nine additional districts of Punjab (besides Lodhran and Kasur) where there was strong interest in the formation of an Association. Given the intensive and extensive outreach that was done, strong and increasing support for the LCA at all levels of the local government system, the work and successful functioning of the IJC, and the lessons learned from the study tour, the immediate next target was the actual establishment of the formal LGA at a founding convention that was held on July 2006 in Lahore where the first board and presidency was elected. The ever-made Association of local governments was named ‚ÄúLocal Councils Association of the Punjab (LCAP)‚Äù.  Work  LCAP works to strengthen decentralization and local self-government in Punjab and to increase communication within the local governments., with upper governments and more particularly with the citizens. The organization also works to provide the local citizens access to basic services such as water, sanitation, health and transport. LCAP generates its revenue from Annual Membership Fee, Grants from different Development Partners for specific actions and interest on income from Bank Deposits.  International affiliations  LCAP is a member of several global networks of local governments and their associations which include United Cities and Local Governments] (UCLG), Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) and Local Governance Initiative and Network (LOGIN). LCAP is also in partnership with number of international institutions that provide trainings to local government functionaries around the year. Most prominent are International Urban Training Center (IUTC), the Hague Academy and Committee on Institutional Building (CIB).

K. T. F. Baermann (1877-1950) Gustav Karl Theodor Friedrich Baermann (also known as B√§rmann; 7 February 1877.Eastern Prussian Provinces, Poland, Civil Registry 1874-1945 certificate: 3308 ‚Äì 1950), was a medical doctor and researcher into public health in the early 20th century. He worked for the former Dutch East Indies administration as a foreign scientist. He was the originator of the Baermann Technique for the extraction of larval roundworms and published his seminal work in 1917. Biography Baermann was born in Breslau, former Prussia, now Poland to Heinrich Baermann (1841-1918) and Anna Mathilde Carolina n√©e Dompierre (1843-1931). Baermann married his first wife, Eva Helene Emilie Erika Weinbach on 31 December 1904 in Breslau, former Prussia, now Poland.Eastern Prussian Provinces, Poland, Civil Registry 1874-1945 certificate: 698 He studied for his PhD at Universit√§t Breslau, and graduated in 1905. Baermann worked with and contributed to the work of Albert Neisserhttp://www.antimicrobe.org/h04c.files/history/Neisser.pdf whom he accompanied on his expeditions to Java in 1905 and 1907 to study venereal diseases in humans. In 1905 Neisser organised a privately funded expedition to Java. This island was chosen because of information that syphilis was more prevalent there than on Borneo or Sumatra. Participants included his wife and at least one of his trainees, Gustav Baermann. According to Neisser, at any one time they had 10-20 orang-utans, imported from Borneo, 20-30 gibbons and 600-800 monkeys (mainly macaques) in captivity. Many also died, not of pneumonia as in Breslau, but of gastroenteritis. Apes were more easily infected with syphilis than monkeys. The incubation period typically was 3‚Äì5 weeks. To test for the dissemination of the pathogen, tissue was taken from various organs of infected animals and inserted into healthy ones. It was found that marrow and, secondly, spleen were the most consistent sites of the pathogen. Blood was never infectious. Although secondary lesions occurred only in apes, it was demonstrated that unresponsiveness did not indicate lack of dissemination in monkeys. While they were in Java in 1905, Fritz Schaudinnn (1871-1906) and Erich Hoffmann (1868-1959) in Berlin discovered the Spirochaeta pallida, the pathogen of syphilis. How Neisser learned of this discovery is uncertain, but he at once attempted to verify the finding. This was successful in humans, as well as in a few apes and monkeys. Neisser credited most of this work to Baermann. A government-funded second expedition to Java was made in 1906-07. In this, in addition to continuing the experiments with primates and monkeys, attempts were made to transmit syphilis to other mammals and chickens. Success occurred only in guinea pigs, but thereby introduced a more practical animal for syphilis experimentation. This investigation, to which Rudolf P√ºrckhauer was assigned, continued in Breslau until 1909. It is not clear if Baermann remained in the far-east or spent the intervening years in Breslau, however in the 1920s, he worked in Indonesia. Baermann later remarried Nina Marie Victorine Wetter (1896-1972) and they lived in Deli-Medan, Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies) raising a family of three children. While in Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies) he published a number of works on public health,Baermann, G. and Eckersdorff, O. (1913) Atlas Tropischer Darmkrankheiten. Leipzig, Barth. parasitic disease and he was active in trying to improve medical facilities in Deli-Medan. He returned to Germany in the early 1930s setting up a medical practice. German telephone books list him from 1932 as a general practice doctor in Munich, which continue until 1947. He died in 1950. B√§rmann [SIC], G.; Eckersdorff, O.

In English: A simple method for the detection of Ankylostomum (nematode) larvae in soil tests. https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19182900349 involves taking a glass funnel (size depending on sample size) and affixing rubber tubing to the bottom end and closing with a Mohr or Bunsen clip. The funnel is then filled with sterilised water. A sample is held within a gauze and tied with string and suspended from a retort ring so that the sample touches the surface of the water. A light can be set up above the apparatus (in this way similar to the Tullgren-Berlese funnel). Liquor from the bottom of the apparatus is removed periodically by opening the clip into a small beaker and drops from this examined under the microscope. Eggs can be enumerated using a haemocyctometer or Coulter counter. The extraction is a partial extraction with some estimates of approximately 50% of total sample content. If the sample is too dry, nematodes may find mobility within the sample difficult and if the sample is too wet, the sample will migrate into the water contaminating the extract. Typically a sample of 100 to 200g is used of a paste-like consistency. The method has been evaluated by Todd et al. (1970)Todd, K.S. JR., Levine, N.D.; and Andersen, F.L.

She then completed her postgraduate training at the Central School of Art and Design in London from 1959 to 1961 under the tuition of Merlyn Evans and Tony Harrison where she gained a thorough grounding in etching techniques. McLaren won a French Government scholarship to study at Atelier 17 in Paris from 1961 to 1962 with Stanley William Hayter.Who‚Äôs Who in Art, 'McLaren, Sally', 15th Edition. Havant, Hants: The Art Trade Press Ltd, 1970. pp. 358-359. SBN No. 900083026 She found Hayter's personality electrifying and this had a lasting influence on her work. Career McLaren was elected to associate membership (ARE) of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers) in 1961 while she was still a student and subsequently became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in 1973, which entitles McLaren to use the post-nominal letters RE after her name. McLaren was also an original member of the Printmakers Council of Great Britain, becoming a Fellow in 1971. Teaching: McLaren taught etching at Goldsmiths College of Art in London from 1962 to 1965. Work In 1971 the Arts Review critic commented that her earlier work was influenced by Hayter, and although she had absorbed his techniques she subsequently 'turned it to her own ends'. Largely abstract, McLaren's work has been described as a 'vision of a rural idyll rooted in the bold sweeps' of the countryside, which rarely dissolves into total abstraction, but treads a path between abstract and a realistic view of nature. Her work takes inspiration from the land, seascape and the elements, with her priority being to 'simplify'. She is influenced by the feeling of 'walking inside a painting', something she experiences when looking at Mark Rothko's work. Her colour palette echoes the landscape: Cinnabar Green and Raw Umber reflects the Wiltshire countryside with Ultramarine and Cobalt blue representing flax fields. McLaren's etching observes the marks made on the land and on rock faces, with studio based drawings of graphite-stick and pencil often made from her subconscious. Her work in either oils or watercolour projects a pattern of surface colour and her considerable experience of printmaking, using texture to build shapes and colour, results in bold expressive work. McLaren has exhibited extensively in the UK and abroad - see below for examples.

It has a surface accuracy around 70/100 Œºm, giving an operating wavelength of 30-3mm (10-100GHz), and was originally designed to observe down to 1 mm (300 GHz). The optical telescope has a mirror, with a focal length. Telescope never operates from the date of its implementation.  History  Construction took place between 1975 and 1985, first operating in 1986. It was not damaged by the 1988 Armenian earthquake, and was used for observations between 1987 and 1990. It stopped being used around 1990, and in the mid-1990s a plan to restore the telescope to use it for astronomy was proposed. It was subsequently restructured in 1995-2010, with a new control computer, new feeds, and observations in collaboration with the Astronomical Society of Russia and the National Technical University of Athens. From around 2012 onwards, moving the secondary mirror was not possible due to a defective control arm, with a restoration plan in 2018 so that the telescope can be used in the European VLBI Network.

He was one of the leading commercial shipbuilders on the River Thames during the period of enormous mercantile expansion and the Dutch wars after the Restoration.. Early life Johnson was baptized on. 25 January 1623, the eldest son of Francis Johnson of Aldeburgh and his wife Mary Pett, daughter of Peter Pett of Deptford, Kent. His father was descended from a merchant family and his great-grandfather Francis Johnson settled at Aldeburgh and was MP for the borough in 1597. His mother‚Äôs family were shipbuilders of Kent. He succeeded his father in 1636. In 1639 he was apprenticed as a shipbuilder to his cousin Phineas Pett, the Royal Shipwright. .He married Dorothy Lord, daughter of William Lord of Melton, Kent, on 13 December 1648. Career The East India Company's Yard at Deptford, 17th Century, National Maritime Museum, GreenwichJohnson was Commissioner for sewers for Middlesex in 1647. By 1651 he was building ships for both the merchant service and the Commonwealth navy at Deptford, constructing two ships of over 500 tons at Deptford for the government in 1649 and 1650. The East India Company decided to sell its shipyard and docks at Blackwall because the finances of the company were poor, and its business was affected by the Civil War. Johnson was able to buy the yard for ¬£4,350. He lived at Blackwall in the house at the entrance to the dockyard at the north- west corner of the yard. Between 1653 and 1656 he bought land outside the yard and he built the Globe Tavern and the coopers' buildings and a slaughter house. In 1656, the property was described as having three docks, two launching slips, two cranes, and storehouses.In 1659, he commissioned the building of a large wet dock which was the largest on the river for 30 years. Poplar and Blackwall dock, 1703 After the Restoration, Johnson became one of the leading shipbuilders and owners of the time.

Johnson was building ships for the Royal Navy and the East India Company, in which he held ¬£1,200 stock.In 1663, he was a member of the Royal Adventurers into Africa.. He was a great friend of Samuel Pepys who as senior clerk in the Navy office commissioned a survey in 1666 which Johnson‚Äôs yard had the greatest capacity of all commercial yards on the Thames. As business expanded there was a shortage of skilled labour and Johnson had to seek assurances that his carpenters and other work were not set upon by the press gangs. He continued to take a share of the merchants business and was a member of the Royal Africa Company in 1672. From 1677 to 1680, he was Commissioner for assessment for Middlesex and Suffolk, and by 1678 was a captain. of Middlesex foot militia.

His instruments are recognized as key examples of 18th century violin making in Flanders, characterized by their fine work and golden-yellow varnish.  Biography  Henri-Joseph de Lannoy started at age 18 as an apprentice violin maker in Borgendael, Brussels. After completing his apprenticeship, de Lannoy worked in several cities. From 1740 to 1752, he worked in Lille, followed by a period in Ghent (1752-1760) and The Hague (1760-1761). He successively travelled to Rotterdam, Antwerp and Mons, while expanding his knowledge of violin making. From time to time he returned to Brussels, where he finally settled with his brother Jean-Joseph-Andr√© de Lannoy in the year 1767. He began working for the Brussels Court around 1784, as suggested by a letter he sent to the Finance Council with the aim of taking over the post of the late E. Michiels. In this same letter, he wrote that he had been a luthier for more than 50 years. Shortly before this letter, on the death of Michiels, Henri-Jacques de Croes highly recommended de Lannoy at the Council of Finance, calling him the \\"... one and only good worker in this kind of craft I know...\\". He would be employed by the Court until 1794, becoming the last luthier of the Royal Chapel of the Austrian Netherlands.

Early life and education Born in 1879 in Livorno, Italy to a wealthy Jewish family, Mieli was raised on Chianciano, a small spa town in Tuscany, to which his family moved in 1880. In 1904 he obtained a degree in chemistry, followed by six months of study at the University of Leipzig, attending the lectures of the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. His chemistry career continued, and in 1908 he moved to the Sapienza University of Rome to work with Emanuele Paterno. He subsequently became a university lecturer in chemistry at the University. Socialism Mieli was a member of the Socialist Party, which led to his election as town councillor in Chianciano in 1901. He left in 1903. Mieli claimed in his autobiography that he left the Socialist movement due to the lack of sincerity and idealism in the movement. Police records, however, showed that Mieli's homosexuality, referred to as 'manifest immorality' was well known in the local area, which would have severely inhibited his political career. Secret police raided his flat in Rome in 1929, just a few months after he had moved to France. Mieli's friend Gino Chiappini, a typographer, and his friend Angelo Pisani were living there at the time. By 1930, police records marked him as a \\"dangerous socialist\\". History of science Mieli is now considered one of the founders of the discipline of the history of science, as one of the first to consider it a discipline it its own right. His history of science career began whilst a chemistry lecturer in Rome, building on interest stimulated in his studies in Germany. In 1912, he founded, and briefly maintained, a section in the journal Rivista di filosofia for the history of science. He edited the Italian bibliography for the then new journal Isis, and in 1916, published a pamphlet calling for a chair of history of science to be created in Italian universities. He also wrote several books on history of science topics, and edited a series on classic texts in science and philosophy for Laterza, an Italian publisher. He taught history of science at the University of Rome between 1919 and 1928, and the University of Perugia in 1926. He was elected a member of Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina in 1925. In 1919, he founded the journal Archeion (later renamed 'Archives internationales d'histoire des sciences' and still published), which he continued to edit until three years before he died. Many organisations, including UNESCO, provided funding for the journal, which he also subsidised from his own finances. In 1928 he moved to Paris. There, Mieli co-founded, and served as permanent secretary of the Comite International d'Histoire des Sciences (the International Committee for the History of Science), renamed the International Academy of the History of Science at its First International Congress of the History of Science, held in Paris in May 1929. At that meeting, Archeion became the official journal of the Academy. That same year, Mieli was invited to create and direct a Unit for the History of Science at the Centre international de synth√®se, which had been created in 1925 by Henri Berr. The Unit officially opened on 22 January 1930. He worked there, collaborating with Helene Metzger until 1939, when he moved to Argentina. He was very ill when he arrived in Argentina, and spent several months in hospital. He worked at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Santa F√©, from 1940 to 1943 where he founded an Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and continued to edit Archeion. Following the 1943 Argentine coup d'√©tat and the new Government's intervention in the university, his employment contract was cancelled, and he retired to Florida, near Buenos Aires. In poor health, and without the financial backing of the university, he ceased being editor of Archeion, which was subsequently relaunched as Archives internationales d'histoire des sciences. He began to write Panorama general de historia de la ciencia, a survey of the history of science, intended to be an eight-volume set. He completed and published the first two volumes, and had proofs of the third, fourth and fifth, by the time he died. Understandings of sexuality L'amore omosessuale, published ca. 1925 In 1921, Mieli founded the 'Societ√† italiana per lo studio delle questioni sessuali' (Italian society for the study of sexual matters), an organisation to discuss sexuality and sexology. He also founded the journal Rassegna di Studi Sessuali (Sexual Studies Review). The journal published a range of topics on sex and sexuality, notably including the works of Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfield and Mieli had both been members of the organizing committee of the first Congress of Sexology, in Berlin, held earlier that year in 1921. These activities formed part of Mieli's strategy to encourage public debate on sexual issues with a view to changing government policies on sexuality. He considered homosexuality a \\"completely natural fact, not something to cure but to be analysed with a high degree of objectivity\\", which Benadusi notes was an \\"absolute novelty\\". Selected publications Mieli published extensively in a wide range of journals, and wrote several books. Selected publications include: * Aldo Mieli, G.

The film is produced by Eric Barrett, and Andrew Slater under the banner of Mirror Films. The film stars Lou Adler, Fiona Apple, the Beach Boys, Beck, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Jade Castrinos, Eric Clapton, David Crosby, Jakob Dylan, Norah Jones, and Michelle Phillips. It had its world premiere at the LA Film Festival on September 20, 2018. It was released in theaters May 24, 2019. An accompanying soundtrack has also been released on CD, vinyl and digitally featuring Jakob Dylan and guests such as Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Fiona Apple and Beck amongst others.  Plot  Echo In The Canyon celebrates the popular music that came out of L.A.‚Äôs Laurel Canyon neighborhood in the mid-60s as folk went electric and the Byrds, the Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield, and the Mamas and the Papas cemented the California Sound. It was a moment (1965 to 1967) when bands came to L.A. to emulate the Beatles and Laurel Canyon emerged as a hotbed of creativity and collaboration for a new generation of musicians who would soon put an indelible stamp on the history of American popular music. Hosted by Jakob Dylan, the film explores the Laurel Canyon scene via never-before-heard personal details behind the bands and their songs and how that music continues to inspire today. The songs from that era provide an entry point as Dylan and some of his fellow musicians interpret and perform many of these classic songs in concert at L.A.'s Orpheum Theatre. Echo in the Canyon contains candid conversations and performances with Brian Wilson (The Beach Boys), Michelle Phillips (The Mamas & the Papas), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield), David Crosby (The Byrds), Roger McGuinn (The Byrds) their contemporaries Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and slightly younger followers Jackson Browne and Tom Petty (in his last film interview) as well as contemporary musicians influenced by their music such as Beck, Fiona Apple, Cat Power, Regina Spektor and Norah Jones.

The film has had a total domestic gross of $3,345,774 (as of September 26, 2019). = Critical response = On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 54 reviews, and an average rating of 7.22/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A thoroughly entertaining look at the Laurel Canyon scene as well as the musical history surrounding it, Echo in the Canyon is essential viewing for rock doc fans.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"This is a sunny, sepia-toned, nostalgic trip to the past. The protest movements of the time are acknowledged ‚Äî after all, many of these songs were anthems for change and peace ‚Äî but this isn‚Äôt a historical documentary about class warfare and racial strife and the anti-war movement and the Manson Family murders, etc.\\" Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail wrote, \\"That‚Äôs David Crosby‚Äôs take on the seminal California folk-rock scene of 1965 to ‚Äô67, an era explained lovingly and with due reverence in the hashish- scented documentary Echo in the Canyon.\\" In addition, the movie has also been criticized for glaring omissions about the historical period; namely other rock music luminaries who resided in the area in that period such as Jim Morrison of The Doors and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell are not mentioned.

When he surrendered himself to the police, M√ºller confessed to killing his wife and son, as well as his parents and other wives around the world. Only the murders of his wife and son were proven, but taking his insanity into consideration, M√ºller was acquitted by reason of insanity and sent off to a mental institution, where he presumably died. Early life and travels Not much is known about M√ºller's early life, aside the fact that he was born in an unspecified location in Germany, with his father being a foreman at the Prussian state railways. In 1888, he married a woman whom later gave birth to a son, the family residing in Berlin. M√ºller, a skilled artisan who worked as a watchmaker and gold miner, went bankrupt in January 1890, and quickly abandoned his wife. He travelled around the world, visiting many countries and supposedly marrying many women. Near the end of 1891, M√ºller was in India, riding an elephant, when he suddenly fell off the animal. Due to his injuries, he was placed in hospital for some time for treatment of epileptic seizures and an unspecified mental condition, from which, by his own admission, he never fully recovered. =Imprisonment in England= In March 1893, M√ºller boarderd a ship from India towards England, passing through France on the way. The penniless watchmaker landed at Dover, and at the end of March, he found himself in London. A police constable named Ridgway found the man wandering around Southwark on March 30, taking M√ºller to the St. George's Workhouse on Mint Street. There, M√ºller, speaking in German because he didn't know or understand English, explained to the doctor various fascinating tales, as well as professing that he butchered his parents, wife and several children. Most peculiarly, at times he even claimed that he had killed over 4,000 people, and that the police were hunting him down, with intent to kill. His insane claims led the doctor to procure a certificate, with which M√ºller was sent away to the London County Lunatic Asylum in Banstead, on April 15, 1893. While in Banstead, his presence puzzled staff, as examinations proved that M√ºller was a healthy and mostly stable personality, not counting his suicidal thoughts, with no sign of any epileptic fits at all. He was considered a well-behaved patient, doing any task given without hesitation, but his perseverance in not understanding English, which hampered any investigation into his past, led to a medical student by the name of Dr. Shaw, who spoke fluent German and French, to question M√ºller. While interviewed by Shaw, M√ºller explained his incident in India, and also took time to complain about the doctor from St. George's, whom claimed that he had seen him talk to himself in a strange manner. Shaw noted that while M√ºller spoke clearly and intelligently, was thorough and pretty genuine about having no friends in England, the claim that he was unmarried was not believed. In May 1893, the secretary of the Prussian state railways sent a letter to Shaw, from M√ºller's family, in which they were eager to know if their loved one was suffering from an incurable disease. The good doctor replied positively to the question, as M√ºller's mental health seemingly improved, so much so that on June 22, 1893, a committee of visitors approved his release as \\"fully recovered\\". Shortly following his discharge, track of M√ºller was lost, but he soon resurfaced and sent off to Germany as a pauper. He returned to Berlin, managed to convince his wife to take him back and to restore the family to what it was. M√ºller also expressed interest in returning to his old line of work, and to finally settle down in life. Murder of Margaret M√ºller and son However, the happiness did not last long. Towards the end of 1895, Gustav sent away his wife away to a circus one evening, taking time to steal 1,600 Deutsche Mark that she had inherited. He then fled with Margaret Hanneman and her 1-year-old son, whom was secretly Gustav's child, settling first in Amsterdam, before moving to Rotterdam. In both places, the family lived off the stolen money, but M√ºller still managed to get employment as a well-respected watchmaker. In October 1897, while cleaning mussels for the lunch meal, M√ºller suddenly heard a voice telling him to cut his wife's throat. Feeling compelled to do that, he slashed Margaret's throat, nearly decapitating her, before repeating the process with his son. Realising what he had just done, he cut off both ears of the corpses, and quickly went towards the police station. Arrest, confession and acquittal M√ºller dashed into the Kassmarkt police station, approached an on-duty officer, and exclaimed that he had just murdered his wife and child. When questioned on how he had done it, Gustav explained to the policeman, but thinking that he was either crazy or a drunkard, the officer laughed. Enraged, M√ºller pulled out the bloodied ears, and said that if they want to confirm his story, they should go his house. He was arrested on the spot, while the Police Department Chief Strang and two other policemen quickly travelled towards the confessed killer's house. Upon arrival, they found Mrs. M√ºller and the young boy's bodies, both nearly decapitated, and the room splattered with blood. Chief Strang then returned to the station, and placed M√ºller under examination. Without hesitation, Gustav explained that he had murdered not just them, but also his parents, other wives and an uncertain amount of children. After he finished confessing, he stood silent, refusing to eat anything, as he viewed that was his only viable attempt at suicide. The police considered his story as credible, suspecting that other murders were committed in the Orient. However, nothing could be confirmed with certainty, and his parents were found to be still living in Germany. On December 2, 1897, the District Court of Rotterdam acquitted M√ºller by reason of insanity, and sent him off to an unspecified asylum, where it is presumed he later died.

It was devised by Mark Reid in conjunction with Yorkshire Water (YW) and it passes by over more than 20 reservoirs which are operated by Yorkshire Water. Background Yorkshire Water is the largest land owner in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, with over and over 100 reservoirs in its portfolio. The Yorkshire Water Way was devised in conjunction with Mark Reid, an established writer and authority on long distance paths. In 2006, a book was launched to cover the first section between Kettlewell in North Yorkshire and Ilkley in West Yorkshire, with a book covering the southern section following two years later. Yorkshire Water maintain most of the route, though some of the path is on existing routes such as the Pennine Way. The route is divided into the two stages: Kettlewell to Ilkley () and Ilkley to Langsett Reservoir (). However, the books guide walkers to be able to complete the walk in stages, or the entire walk takes about seven days to complete. Route The route starts in the village of Kettlewell in Upper Wharfedale and heads east over Great Whernside to reach the reservoirs in the Upper Nidderdale area (Angram, Scar House and Gouthwaite). It then heads south through Pateley Bridge and into the Washburn Valley passing Thruscross, Fewston and Swinsty reservoirs. After this is passes over Denton Moor and into West Yorkshire via a footbridge over the River Wharfe into Ilkley, where the first book ends. South of Ilkley, the trail heads over Ilkley Moor passing Weecher Reservoir and going into the Aire Valley through Shipley, Bingley, Harden, Cullingworth, Cross Roads and Haworth before passing Lower Laithe Reservoir and heading west across Haworth Moor and dropping into Calderdale past the three reservoirs at Walshaw Dean. After this, it heads south past Hebden Bridge and then by Withens Clough, Baitings, Dean Head and Cupwith reservoirs. After Marsden, the walk goes past Butterley, Blakeley, Wessenden and Wessenden Head reservoirs, before crossing the A635 road and going inbetween Bilberry and Digley Reservoirs.

Imer The Narsaq stick is a pine twig inscribed with runic symbols dating to ca. 1000. The stick was discovered in Narsaq in Greenland in 1953 and was quickly seen as a significant find, as it was the first Viking Age runic inscription discovered in Greenland. The stick has two sentences of ambiguous and obscure runic text. One suggested interpretation of the first sentence is \\"He who sat on a tub saw a tub\\" while another is \\"On the sea, the sea, the sea is the ambush of the √Üsir\\". The other sentence refers to a maiden named \\"Bibrau\\" who may be sitting on the sky. The runic alphabet is carved on one side of the stick in a short-twig form. Yet another side has a series of carefully carved symbols of unclear meaning, possibly cipher runes or some sort of tally. Scholars have suggested various possibilities for the purpose of the stick. Relatively mundane ideas include that the text is a play on words, a pedagogical exercise in runic ambiguity or a riddle. Magical and religious purposes have also been suggested, with the stick being a pagan plea for protection against the dangers of the sea or possibly a case of love magic. Various parallels have been suggested, particularly with runic inscriptions from Bergen in Norway. Discovery and archaeological context The site where the Narsaq stick was discovered. A sign gives information on the archaeological excavations. Remains of old habitation in Narsaq were first discovered by Aage Roussell in 1935. The site was placed under conservation order but in 1945 the restrictions were lifted since surface examination of the ruins had not indicated that they were especially valuable. In 1953 a local man, K. N. Christensen, was collecting mud for agriculture at the site of the ruins. He discovered artifacts made of bone and wood in the mud, including a runic stick. Christensen stopped digging and sent the artifacts to the National Museum of Denmark. In the summer of 1954, archaeologist Christen Leif Pagh Veb√¶k undertook excavations at the site and found various remains, including arrowheads which could be dated to the oldest period of Norse settlement in Greenland. Further excavations were conducted in 1958 and 1962 and smaller-scale studies took place in 1998-2005\\\\. Radiocarbon analysis of the site confirms that the oldest layer dates to ca. 1000. The stick was found in the middle of the living area of the farm. Five other objects with runic symbols have been discovered at the site, all with short and difficult to interpret inscriptions. The Narsaq stick was the first Viking Age runic inscription to be discovered in Greenland. Writing in 1961, runologist Erik Moltke described the find as \\"epoch-making\\" and more important than even the Kingittorsuaq stone. Description The pine stick is natural and only slightly worked. Erik Moltke argued that it must have been carved in Greenland since only in a tree-poor country would a self-respecting rune-carver deign to use such a wretched piece of wood. When found, it was broken into two pieces but this did not cause much damage to the runes. The stick was later glued back together. It has a length of 42.6 cm and the broader sides have a width of 2.4 cm at the widest. The four sides were labeled A, B, C and D by Moltke. Sides A and C are the broad sides and sides B and D are the narrow sides. Side A has an inscription with linguistic content and Side C has what looks like cipher runes. These are both elegantly cut. Side B has the younger fu√æark alphabet. It uses the same form of runes as side A but may have been cut by a less skilled hand. Some additional marks on two of the sides appear to be mere scribbles or tests. The inscription on side A uses short-twig runes but the form of the s rune is unusual, it has the form normally used for the R rune. The runes on side A apparently form two sentences each starting with an √ó sign. The inscription reads as follows: √ó ƒÖ : sa : sa : sa : is : ƒÖsa : sat √ó bibrau : haitir : mar : su : is : sitr : ƒÖ : blan·ªã The final i is uncertain and it is possible that something is lost at the end. The first sentence The ambiguous first sentence: ƒÖ : sa : sa : sa : is : ƒÖsa : sat with an unusual type of s rune. The first sentence (ƒÖ : sa : sa : sa : is : ƒÖsa : sat) is highly ambiguous. Runic sa can stand for a number of Old Norse words, including the pronoun s√° (\\"that one\\"), the verb s√° (\\"saw\\") and the noun forms s√° (\\"tub\\") and s√¶ (\\"sea\\"). There are similarities between this sentence and runic inscriptions from Norway, in particular B 566 from Bergen which reads in part huatsasaerisasasiksasaerisasa and has been taken to mean \\"What did he see who looked into the tub? He saw himself, he who looked into the tub.\\" (Hvat s√° s√°, er √≠ s√° s√°? Sik s√° s√°, er √≠ s√° s√°.) The text is then a play on three s√° homonyms. Texts similar to that on B 566 are also found on B 617 from Bergen and A 162 from Trondheim and there is a further possible parallel on a bone discovered in Sigtuna in Sweden in 1995. An interpretation of the first sentence of the Narsaq stick as a play on homonyms was first proposed by J√≥n Helgason who took the sentence to mean \\"He who sat on a tub saw a tub.\\" (√Å s√° s√° s√° es √° s√° sat.), noting as a parallel an Icelandic quatrain which plays on s√° homonyms. This interpretation has been called \\"very convincing\\" and \\"the most appealing\\". Other interpretations have been proposed. Erik Moltke took the first sentence to mean \\"On the sea, the sea, the sea is the ambush of the √Üsir.\\" (√Å s√¶, s√¶, s√¶ es √Åsa s√°t), indicating that the sea is treacherous for anyone not favored by the gods. Helgi Gu√∞mundsson further suggested that the gods in question would be √Ügir and R√°n and that s√°t should be understood as \\"dwelling place\\". Another proposal was offered by √ìlafur Halld√≥rsson: \\"He who did not see the sea saw the sea.\\" (√Å s√¶ s√° s√° es √° s√¶ s√°at). In this interpretation the sentence is a riddle with the answer 'mirage' given in the second sentence. The second sentence The second sentence: bibrau : haitir : mar : su : is : sitr : ƒÖ : blan·ªã. The a and b runes have switched places compared to more common short-twig usage. The second sentence (bibrau : haitir : mar : su : is : sitr : ƒÖ : blan·ªã) is mostly straightforward but the first and last words are difficult. The sentence can be translated as \\"bibrau is the name of the maiden who sits on blan·ªã\\" (bibrau heitir m√¶r s√∫ es sitr √° blan·ªã). The word or name bibrau is unknown elsewhere. Moltke took its first component to be bif- (\\"movement\\" or \\"shaking\\") as in Bifr√∂st and gave Bifrau, Bifrey and Bifr√≥ as possible renderings. The b rune is then used for a sound more often represented by the f rune. This is a relatively archaic feature, found in some North Atlantic inscriptions such as the Ballaugh stone cross. √ìlafur Halld√≥rsson suggested the rendering Bifbr√° which he took to mean \\"mirage\\" like Icelandic t√≠br√° and Faroese lognbr√° and to answer what he saw as a riddle in the first sentence. Helgi Gu√∞mundsson saw Bifr«´ÃÅ as the most likely option and points out that Norwegian and Swedish r√• is a word for v√¶ttir or mythical beings. The ending of the word blan·ªã is uncertain and Moltke suggested blanum as a reconstruction. He took this to be dative of Bl√°inn, one of the names of the primordial giant out of whose skull the blue sky was made. The sense would be that the maiden sits on the blue sky. Helgi Gu√∞mundsson argues that the expected dative of Bl√°inn is Bl√°ni and that this fits well with what can be seen of the runic word. The sense \\"blue sky\\" has been adapted, with some hesitation, by several scholars. An alternative proposal by J√≥n Helgason is to take blan·ªã to represent bl√°nni, the dative singular of bl√° (\\"pond\\" or \\"marsh\\") with the suffixed article. J√≥n proposes this with the caveat that this is a rather early inscription for the suffixed article to make an appearance. Cipher runes? The inscription on side C of the Narsaq stick as presented by Bernard Mees. Side C of the stick is carefully carved with 49 signs using the same technique as on the A side. The row begins with four apparently normal runes, aaal, but then continues with a repeated symbol with the appearance of a bind-rune formed of k and reversed upside-down k. These symbols are divided into groups with one-point division marks. In the middle of the line there are again some normal runes, aaaaa, followed by more bind- runes of the same type. The meaning of this row of symbols is unknown. Moltke compared the carving to known systems of coded runes based on the principle of dividing the runic alphabet into three groups (√¶ttir) and referring to each rune by the number of the group and its location within the group. He was unable to arrive at an interpretation in this manner. Nevertheless, Moltke argued that the symbols are carved and organized with such care that they must have a meaning. Marie Stoklund similarly comments that \\"The inscription has not yet been deciphered, though it looks as if it ought to make sense\\". Jonas Nordby is less certain that the carvings are based on a cipher system, suggesting that they might be some form of tally. Purpose and parallels Erik Moltke saw the Narsaq stick as a pagan artifact with religious or magical significance. In his interpretation, the maiden Bifrau is a benevolent mythological being as well as possibly an asterism. She is invoked for protection on the treacherous sea. The core of the magic could be encoded in the cipher runes which might contain the name of the runemaster or a magical word. Helgi Gu√∞mundsson pointed out that a virgin sitting on the sky was reminiscent of Christian ideas but that this did not seem to throw any light on the text. He also suggested a similarity to lines from the Eddic poem Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l: \\"Hr√¶svelgr he is called who sits at the end of the sky\\". In addition to other inscriptions with word play on s√°, scholars have pointed more generally to inscriptions and manuscript texts containing repeated s+vowel elements. Two runic sticks from Bergen (B 524 and B 404) contain s+vowel formulas next to references to attractive women. This has been seen as a parallel to the 'maiden' and repeated sa of the Narsaq stick. Scholars have speculated that some form of love magic was involved. There are also obscure occurrences of s+vowel repetitions in manuscript texts including sisisill bivivill in a manuscript of the Prose Edda and sa sa sa sa sa salutem in domino sa in a manuscript from Bergen. J√≥n Helgason suggested that the stick had a pedagogic function with the inscription intended to illustrate the ambiguity of runic writing. He makes a lighthearted suggestion that the carver was Erik the Red himself and the pupil his son Leif and stages a conversation between the two.

The library is meant to create graphical applications and games quickly and easily. The official website introduces it as \\"a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy video games programming.\\" The library is highly inspired by the Borland BGI graphics library and by the XNA framework and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education. The source code is written in plain C (C99) and it's primarily intended for beginners, distributed under a zlib/libpng OSI certified open-source license. It supports compilation to many target platforms, including Windows, GNU Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Android, Raspberry Pi and HTML5. raylib has been ported to more than 40 programming languages in the form of bindings, allowing users to access the library functionality in their favorite programming language. History raylib development started in August 2013 by Ramon Santamaria to support a game development course, focused on students with no previous coding experience and artistic profile; the library acted as a direct replacement of WinBGI. During the course, raylib was further developed based on the feedback of the students and by June 2014, the library was starting to be showcased in several game development events in Barcelona. raylib 1.0 was released in November 2013 and it featured around 80 functions for window and inputs management, basic shapes drawing, textures loading and drawing, fonts loading, text drawing, basic 3d shapes drawing, audio system management and audio files loading and playing. First raylib version went through 8 subversion iterations (from raylib 1.1 to raylib 1.8), growing version after version with the addition of new modules, new platforms and new features along 5 years. Some of the most notable improvements were Android, WebAssembly and Raspberry Pi support, multiple OpenGL backends, VR support and +50 examples to explore and learn. raylib 2.0 was released in July 2018 and for the first time the library removed all external dependencies, all required libraries are included and compiled along raylib. This version also exposed a number of configuration options for the library features to minimize size and it greatly improved build system, supporting various continuous integration systems. Along the following two years multiple parts of the library were reviewed and improved and well as all the library ecosystem. One raylib 2.5 iteration was released in the middle of this process. raylib 3.0 was released in April 2020 featuring several big internal redesigns to improve library portability and bindings generation. Some of the key changes of raylib 3.0 were moving global variables to a global state contexts, support custom memory allocators, a centralized file system for memory data loading and a collection of +115 code examples to explore and learn. raylib has kept growing and improving along several years with the addition of multiple features but always keeping its core value: being a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy programming. Features raylib comes with the following features: * Support for many platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and HTML5 * Support for OpenGL 1.1, 2.1, 3.3 and OpenGL ES 2.0 as backend * Image, textures and fonts loading and drawing from several formats * Audio loading and playing from several formats and streaming support * Math operations for vectors, matrices, and quaternions * 2D rendering with a camera, including automatic sprites batching * 3D models rendering including custom shaders and postprocessing shaders * Support for VR, including configurable HMD device parameters * Support for animated as well as non-animated 3D and 2D models * Big examples collection with +115 code examples  Reception and adoption  raylib was primary intended for education on video games and graphics programming but due to its simplicity and ease of use, it has been also adopted by many hobbyist game developers. There are active and growing communities in multiple networks like reddit and Discord. GitHub lists over 120 projects on raylib topic. Software architecture = Modules = alt= raylib consists of several modules that are exposed to the programmer through the API. Every module is contained in a single C code file and some modules can be used in standalone mode: * core ‚Äì Handles the window creation and OpenGL context initialization as well as inputs management (keyboard, mouse, gamepad and touch input) * rlgl ‚Äì Handles OpenGL backend, abstracting multiple versions to a common API. This module can be used as standalone. * shapes ‚Äì Handles basic 2D shapes rendering (line, rectangle, circle...) and basic collision detection * textures ‚Äì Handles Images and textures loading (CPU and GPU) and management, including Image manipulation functionality (crop, scale, tint...) * text ‚Äì Handles fonts loading as spritesheet and text rendering, also includes some text management functionality (join, split, replace...) * models ‚Äì Handles 3D models loading and drawing, including support for animated models * raudio ‚Äì Handles audio device management and audio files loading and playing, including streaming support. This module can be used as standalone. * raymath ‚Äì Provides a set of math functions for Vector2, Vector3, Quaternion and Matrix structures =Bindings= raylib has language bindings for almost 50 different programming languages, provided by multiple contributors. Some of the languages include: Rust, Go, C# and Lua. All bindings can be viewed in the BINDINGS.md file in the GitHub repository of the library. Many new programming languages like Beef, Odin and Ring provides binding for raylib. The Ring programming language includes raylib in the standard library. = Add-ons = raylib community has contributed with several raylib add-ons to extend the features and connection of raylib with other libraries. Some of the modules are: * raygui ‚Äì Immediate-mode GUI module for easy tools development using raylib * physac ‚Äì physics module intended to be used with raylib * libpartikel ‚Äì particles system module for raylib * spine-raylib ‚Äì Spine animations integration module for raylib * cimgui-raylib ‚Äì Dear Imgui integration module for raylib Awards In April 2019, raylib developer was awarded with the Google Open Source Peer Bonus award for contributing to the open-source ecosystem with raylib. In August 2020, raylib was awarded with an Epic MegaGrant by Epic Games to support raylib development. Examples The following program in the C programming language uses raylib to create a white window with some centered text. #include \\"raylib.h\\" int main(void) { const int screenWidth = 800; const int screenHeight = 450; InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \\"raylib [core] example - basic window\\"); SetTargetFPS(60); while (!WindowShouldClose()) { BeginDrawing(); ClearBackground(RAYWHITE); DrawText(\\"Congrats!

He scored it for mixed choir a cappella divided among many individual voices.  Background  The Norwegian composer Knut Nystedt grew up in a Christian family, where hymns and classical music were part of everyday life. In 1950, he founded a vocal ensemble, Det Norske Solistkor, which he conducted until 1990. Among his roughly 300 choral compositions, which account for three quarters of his works, he wrote several pieces of sacred music, including De Profundis, Op. 54, a 1966 setting of Psalm 130, and Missa brevis, Op. 102, in 1984. In 1987, he derived Immortal Bach from the first line of Johann Sebastian Bach's setting of the funeral song \\"Komm, s√º√üer Tod\\". It was published in 1999 by in Oslo. Immortal Bach was the last piece Nystedt conducted with Det Norske Solistkor before he retired.  Music  Immortal Bach is an arrangement of the first line of Bach's four-part setting of the funeral song \\"Komm, s√º√üer Tod\\". The song for a singer and basso continuo appeared in Schemellis Gesangbuch, BWV 478. The text of the first eight measures which Nystedt used is \\"Komm, s√º√üer Tod. Komm, sel'ge Ruh'. Komm f√ºhre mich in Friede.\\" (Come, sweet death. Komm, blessed rest. Come and lead me to peace.) Nystedt harmonised the bassline to a four-part setting a cappella. The choir first sings this setting. What follows is an arrangement scheme, according to which the singers perform the same music, but in different tempo. In the first and third phrase, all voices begin together and hold the first note for a long time until each voice moves forward in different tempo, and all wait at the end of the phrase until united again. The second phrase is treated slightly differently: the sopranos alone enter on a forceful high note, while the lower voices enter together later, then proceeding as in the other phrases. The work begins and ends pianissimo. Nystedt recommended to place the singers surrounding the audience. Vladimir Morosan, an Russian composer and musicologist with a focus on sacred choral music,Vladimir Morosan: Setting Liturgical Texts to Music oca.org wrote liner notes for Hyperion Records and described the result as \\"theology expressed in sound\\", giving meaning to the phrase \\"time-less\\", and as a \\"glimpse ... of eternity\\".  Recordings  \\"Immortal Bach\\" concludes the record \\"Immortal Nystedt\\", recorded by Norwegian chamber choir Ensemble 96 (conductor √òystein Fevang). The record received two Grammy nominations, and Musicweb international wrote: \\"This arrangement is not obvious in vanilla stereo but, goodness, there are some astonishingly long, sustained choral passages that must require phenomenal breath control. The organ-like sonorities that result are most impressive and a reminder, if it were needed, that this is a choir of considerable talent.\\" Read more: http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2007/Sept07/Nystedt_2L29sacd.htm#ixzz6WyDLCt9C Nystedt's vocal ensemble, Det Norske Solistkor, recorded music by Bach and Nystedt in 2015, conducted by Grete Pedersen, concluding with Immortal Bach.

India was the first country in the world to have been given the pioneer Area for exploration of deep sea mineral viz polymetallic nodules in the central Indian ocean Basin in 1987 .This was based on the extensive survey carried out by the scientists of CSIR-NIO on several research ships leading to the allocation of an area of to the country with exclusive right under the UN law of the sea. Background Exclusive Economic zones are boundaries prescribed by the United nations Convention on the law of the sea which give the rights to a state regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. India has an Exclusive Economic zone allocated which is unexplored and unutilised. Beside India has been allocated a site of in Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) by the United Nation's International Seabed Authority (ISA) for the exploitation of polymetallic nodules (PMN) which is an amalgamation of iron and manganese hydroxide. It has been estimated that 380 million metric tonnes of PMN are available at the bottom of the seas in the Central Indian Ocean.

He had made his debut in minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire in 1906, making 25 appearances in the Minor Counties Championship between 1906-13. He later made a first-class appearance for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University at Lord's in 1914. After graduating from Cambridge, he joined the London Stock Exchange in 1911 as a stockbroker. Cutherbertson served in the First World War, enlisting as a second lieutenant on probation in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in November 1914, with confirmation in the rank in March 1915. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in August 1916. While serving in the Mesopotamian campaign, Cuthbertson fell ill on 20 July 1917 with heat exhaustion after fourteen days in Mesopotamia. He was admitted to hospital at Al Amarah, where his condition continued to deteriorate over the next three days. He died in the evening of 23 July and was buried at the Amara War Cemetery. His brother, Geoffrey Cuthbertson, also played first-class cricket.

Its main image is a hibutsu statue of Yakushi Ny≈çrai, shown to the public every five years, History The temple claims to have been founded in the Nara period by the monk Gy≈çki; however, the style of the main image is from the early Heian period, and written records only exist to verify the reconstruction of the main hall in 971 AD. The temple was the clan temple of the Saigusa clan, an ancient G≈çzoku clan who controlled the eastern K≈çfu basin. The temple was patronized by the Takeda clan in the Sengoku period, and in 1582, Takeda Katsuyori, fleeing defeat at the Battle of Tenmokuzan at Shinpu Castle at the hands of the armies of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, spent one night at this temple. The nun Rikei subsequently wrote a history of the downfall of the Takeda clan, the \\"Rikei-ni no Ki\\", at this temple. Cultural properties =National treasures= Daizen-ji Yakushi-d≈ç The main hall at Daizen-ji was built in the Kamakura period by the Shikken H≈çj≈ç Sadatoki. It was completed in 1290 and is the oldest building in the prefecture. The building is approximately square in layout, with 18 meter long sides and a simple pyramidal roof. In front are doors in the three middle spaces between the columns, and lattice widows on either side. There is one additional door on each side and in the center of the back of the building. The columns have two-stage wooden capitals to support the roof. The building was extensively repaired in the early Edo period, and was completely taken apart, examined and reassembled in 1954. The building was designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan on August 28, 1907 and the designation was upgraded to that of a National Treasure of Japan on June 22, 1955.The altar within the building dates from 1355 and is also included within the National Treasure designation. =National Important Cultural Properties= Daizen-ji Yakushi Ny≈çrai The main image of Daizen-ji, this seated image of Yakushi Ny≈çrai is carved from a single block of cherry wood and is coated with lacquer and gold leaf. From its style, it dates from the early Heian period. The state is 85.5 cm tall. It is flanked by two standing attendants, a Nikk≈ç Bosatsu and a Gakk≈ç Bosatsu, both form the same period and both also carved from single blocks of wood, which the temple inexplicably refers to as Jiz≈ç Bosatsu in its home page. The statues were collectively designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan on April 4, 1905. Daizen-ji J≈´ni Shinsh≈ç The Yakushi Ny≈çrai of Daizen-ji is flanked by statues of the Twelve Heavenly Generals which date from the Kamakura period. Each statue is from 138 to 145 cm tall, and are attributed to the sculptor Renkei, an artist of the Kei school whose works are found at other temples in Kai Province. A couple of statues have the sates of 1227b and 1228. These statues were collectively designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan on June 7, 1999. Daizen-ji Nikk≈ç Bosatsu and Gakk≈ç Bosatsu In addition to the Nikk≈ç Bosatsu and Gakk≈ç Bosatsu which are part of the main image Yakushi Ny≈çrai, Daizen-ji has two larger statues of these divinities located outside the main altar, These statues were carved in the Kamakura period in the yosegi-zukuri technique with crystal inset eyes, and are in the style of the Kei school, and thus are contemporary with the statues of the J≈´ni Shinsh≈ç. The Nikk≈ç Bosatsu is 248 cm tall, and the Gakk≈ç Bosatsu is 247 cm tall. Inside, the statues were found to be stuffed with scrolls containing prayers and petitions from the Kamakura period. The statues and the documents found therein were collectively designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan in June 2007. =Intangible Cultural Property= The Wisteria Cutting Festival (Ëó§Âàá„ÇäÁ•≠) held every year on May 8 celebrates a mythological event in which En no Gy≈çja, a mountain ascetic, saved the lives of the local people by killing a large serpent.

The theorem states that any group extension of a group by a group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the regular wreath product The theorem is named for the fact that the group is said to be universal with respect to all extensions of by Statement Let and be groups, let be the set of all functions from to and consider the action of on itself by right multiplication. This action extends naturally to an action of on defined by \\\\phi(g).h=\\\\phi(gh^{-1}), where \\\\phi\\\\in K, and and are both in This is an automorphism of so we can define the semidirect product called the regular wreath product, and denoted or A\\\\wr H. The group (which is isomorphic to \\\\\\\\{(f_x,1)\\\\in A\\\\wr H:x\\\\in K\\\\\\\\}) is called the base group of the wreath product. The Krasner‚ÄìKaloujnine universal embedding theorem states that if has a normal subgroup and then there is an injective homomorphism of groups \\\\theta:G\\\\to A\\\\wr H such that maps surjectively onto \\\\text{im}(\\\\theta)\\\\cap K.. This is equivalent to the wreath product having a subgroup isomorphic to where is any extension of by Proof This proof comes from Dixon‚ÄìMortimer..

Straus House is a large town house at 9 East 71st Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The exterior was designed by Horace Trumbauer and completed in 1932. A roof extension was added in 1977. The size of the house was believed to be in the late 1980s, and by 2003 had been enlarged to , spread over nine floors. A oak door and large arched windows are distinctive features of the limestone exterior. A heated sidewalk is located in front of the house. Vicky Ward in 2003 described the house as \\"the crown jewel of the city's residential town houses...it sits on‚Äîor, rather, commands‚Äîthe block of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house\\" and that it was believed to be the largest private residence in Manhattan. The house's 2008 property tax bill was the fourth highest for a single residence in New York City. In 2019 it was valued at $77 million by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and at $56 million by the New York City Department of Finance. History Herbert Straus, the sixth of seven children born to Isidor and Ida Straus (co-owners of retailers R. H. Macy & Co.), never lived in the house, and work on the house was canceled shortly before Straus's death in 1933. Straus's heirs never completed work on the house due to the high cost of property taxes. It was unfinished in 1944 when it was donated by the sons of Herbert Straus to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York for a hospital. The Birch Wathen School occupied the house from 1962 until 1989, when it was purchased for $13.2 million by the billionaire businessman Leslie Wexner. It was featured in the December 1995 edition of Architectural Digest. The interior of the house was designed under Wexner by John Stefanidis, and remodelled by the architect Thierry Despont. Jeffrey Epstein Jeffrey Epstein moved into the house in 1996, at which time he claimed to own it, although its registered ownership changed in 2011 from a trust connected to both Wexner and Epstein to a trust controlled by Epstein. Vicky Ward visited Epstein at the house for \\"The Talented Mr Epstein\\", her 2003 profile in Vanity Fair magazine. Ward wrote that she felt that upon entering the house \\"you feel you have stumbled into someone‚Äôs private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person's home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries\\". Rows of 'individually framed eyeballs' manufactured for injured English soldiers decorated the entrance hall along with a 'twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior'. A room described as a \\"leather room\\" had leopard print chairs with walls decorated in 'cordovan-colored fabric'. A large 'Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling lionskin' hung on the walls. A large office spanned the width of the house, decorated with a large Persian rug alongside '18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets' and a desk that belonged to the banker J. P. Morgan. A copy of The Misfortunes of Virtue by the Marquis de Sade, which tells the tale of the sexually abused 12-year old protagonist of the novel, was on the desk. A Steinway grand piano was surmounted by a stuffed black poodle. Epstein told Ward that \\"No decorator would ever tell you to do that...But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog\\". The French decorator Alberto Pinto was responsible for much of the interior. The house has a bathroom lined in lead with closed-circuit television.

It was similar to the Decauville railway, which had been invented and patented in France eight years earlier.  History  The entrepreneur Heinrich Spalding from Glewitz in Western Pomerania was the first German industrialist, who produced in 1884 a narrow-gauge tramway at his own risk for the transport of logs and firewood in the Royal Prussian forest Grimnitz in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The implementation this long tramway between two felling sites and the nearest navigable water at Lake Werbellin, resulted in cost savings of 11,387 marks during the transport of 8,536 m¬≥ of pine and firewood over an average distance of . The costs for providing the tramway amounted to 47,000 Marks, so that the railway system should have paid off in four years. The German Emperor William I, the patron of German hunting, rode in an improvised hunting saloon car on the portable track of the Spalding railway to Schorfheide. From there, for the first time in the history of hunting the German Emperor's hunting bag of game was brought back from the forest by rail.Bericht √ºber die XLIII. General - Versammlung des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande, Westfalens und des Reg.-Bez. Osnabr√ºck am 14., 15. und 16. Juni 1886 in Aachen.  Design  Dolberg, 1892 The Spalding railway used Vignoles rails. The rail joints were initially supported by two wooden sleepers, one of them was wide and the other narrow (Figure 18a), with the wide sleeper protruding beyond the end of one pair of rails, while the narrow one was recessed from the end of the other panel. When the prefabricated panels were joined together, the broad sleeper of one panel lay next to the narrow sleeper of the other. The free rail ends were bolted together using fishplates as in conventional tracks. The system had the advantage that required repairs were easy make but the height of the wooden sleepers prevented the use of horses, and level crossings with other traffic.Freiherr von R√∂ll: Enzyklop√§die des Eisenbahnwesens, Vol 5. Berlin, Wien 1914, p. 42‚Äì54. The Dolberg works in Rostock improved the Spalding system by using metal tie rods and by omitting the narrow wooden sleeper at one end of the panel. To secure the butt joint, the rails were hooked onto a metallic sleeper at one end. One rail was provided with a hooked tab which engaged around a metallic tie rod at the end of the other rails. Th joint could only be taken apart by lifting the opposite end of the frame (Figures 19 and 20). The easy disassembly allowed other traffic to cross easily at level crossings by simply lifting one or two sections from the rail line. The 2 m track sections with a gauge of 600 mm consisted of rails that were connected at both ends by metallic tie rods and rested on wooden sleepers. One man could carry a section with ease. Curved sections were bent with a radius of 4 m. They were only 1.5 meters long and could be used for right and left turns. The 4 m long Spalding universal switch was provided with guard rails, which should make a derailment impossible even if the points were set incorrectly. By simply unscrewing the rails from the pad and then re-assembling them upside-down, a right turn could be turned into a left turn and vice versa, since the switches were made of symmetrical double-headed rail profiles. Turntables with connecting rails were used for right-angle turns. The turntable was easy and safe to operate, because it could be locked after each rotation by using a light lever.W.

Rolling stock  The wooden V skip wagons had double- flange wheels and were very practical. The contents fell far enough from the rails that it did not block the track. As it tilted, all of the contents slid out of the skip without much of it, unlike what happened with other systems, remaining where it had to be shoveled out by hand. The chassis of the tippers could be used as a flat wagon for the transport of general cargo after removing the arched supports at both ends, which were just held in place by a stud and some screws. The wagons were available with or without brakes as required. The brake was operated using a lever and acted simultaneously and evenly on all four wheels, to bring the car or train quickly to a halt. For cars without a brake, a simple wooden handspike was sufficient even in heavily graded terrain. The cars were unusually light. The weight of a car was , while an iron wagon of the same size and load capacity weighed twice as much, so the workers always had to push 200 kg of dead extra load. The chassis and the tilting bodies were made of the best pine wood and were of so simple a design that they could easily be repaired by any blacksmith or carpenter if damaged.  Report on field trials by a landscape gardener from Aachen  W. Kiehl, a professional gardener from Aachen, successfully tested a Spalding Railway in a nursery beginning early 1903. He was able to lay a track over a distance of 250 m over uneven terrain with three men in three hours, although the individual sections had to be collected from various places. He did not use any bolts to connect the fishplates, partly because he had not ordered any. The rolling stock and track building material was so strong that repairs were rarely necessary, except for damage caused by the workers' imprudence. Thus repairs which would have caused extra costs had not been necessary during a whole year of daily operation in Aachen. W. Kiehl thus recommended this railway in the warmest terms to any landscape gardener who had to carry out earthworks. It could readily be seen how easily and cost-effectively this system could be used, because it had been made by professionals for professionals.  Sugar beet train at Wesselburen  Sugar beet wagon with double-flange wheels in the Frankfurter Feldbahnmuseum A long gauge Spaldingbahn was laid in 1883 from Osterhof railway station on the Heide‚ÄìB√ºsum railway to the Osterhof estate of a sugar beet grower and sugar manufacturer of Wesselburen in B√ºsum. In 1883 it carried daily up to 300 t of sugar beets. The bogies of the wagons had four axles with double-flanged wheels and a load capacity of 3 tons (60 quintals). Two of those cars are still preserved in the Frankfurter Feldbahnmuseum, one of them with the original bogies with double- flanged wheels.  Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis  According to an article in the newspaper of the Association of German Railway Administrations, in 1883 the track cost around 5 Marks per meter (5,47 Marks per yard), the installation costs, rolling stock and other equipment amounted to about 5,000 marks, so that providing a railway long required an investment of 20,000 marks. On one such track, which was set-up on the estate of Count H., 6 horses were used to transport about 3,200 t of sugar beet in 40 days. Since an ordinary four-horse cart could carry 6¬º t a day, it would have taken 12¬Ω teams to do the same job during the same time span using conventional carts. Thus 11 four-horse teams were not needed and since each of these would have cost 10 marks for each of the 40 working days, the total savings in one campaign amounted to 4,400 Marks, or 22% of the total investment capital.E.

April 1892 The cost for laying a forestry railway was estimated at 20 Marks per kilometer (32 Marks per mile) in 1886.  Comparison with the Decauville railway  The main differences compared to the Decauville railway were: * Standard length of the track panels of 2 m instead of 5 m (78\\" instead of 197\\") * Universal switches with double-headed rail profiles instead of Vignoles rails * V skip wagons made of pine wood instead of metal * Double- flanged wheels instead of the usual single flanged wheels * Rails bolted to wooden sleepers instead of being riveted to steel sleepers * Self-locking rail joints  Patent  * H.

Family history and early life  Chapman was born and raised in Oklahoma and is of Ponca, Pawnee, and Kiowa heritage. He is a direct lineal descendant of Chief White Eagle, \\"the celebrated chief of the Ponca tribe of Plains Indians, known for his vocal objection to the confinement of his people on reservations and his role in the subsequent ruling for equality for the Indian people in the 1870s.\\" White Eagle was hereditary chief during the Ponca Trail of Tears in 1877.Trail Map, ChiefStandingBear.org, Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs This forced removal killed over 300 people. Among the dead were White Eagle's wife and four of his children. Also dead was White Eagle's father Chief Iron Whip who signed the broken treaty with President Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and was the first Native American in a presidential inaugural parade at the Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. White Eagle and Standing Bear fought the United States for the freedom to leave the confinements of their reservation in the Indian Territory and return to their ancestral lands in Nebraska. In the landmark 1879 civil rights case Standing Bear v. Crook, the Ponca became the first Native Americans to be legally recognized as \\"persons\\" under the meaning of the law and granted civil rights under the Constitution. The controversy over the Ponca Trail of TearsThe Ponca Trail of Tears, nebraskastudies.org also forced President Rutherford B. Hayes to end Andrew Jackson's fifty year old policy of Indian removal that began in 1830 with Jackson's now controversial Indian Removal Act. White Eagle was credited for being responsible for the change in government policy. Chapman attended a public school in rural Oklahoma and earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Oklahoma in 2007 and his J.D. degree at the University of Tulsa College of Law in 2010.  Career  Chapman began his career as an Assistant District Attorney in Oklahoma and prosecuted homicides, violence against women, and crimes against children. In 2012, the Oklahoma rape crisis center Help in Crisis presented Chapman with the Mark Keeley Award for Most Outstanding Male Domestic Violence Advocate by an Oklahoma for championing the cause against violence in Eastern Oklahoma. In 2015, Chapman prosecuted two cases that resulted in published law in Oklahoma's highest appellate court. In the first, Chapman led an appeal that made Oklahoma law regarding when police officers may make arrests or conduct temporary detentions based on information provided by anonymous informants in On the appeal of the second case, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the constitutionality of a 2010 Oklahoma law that creates a zone of safety around certain locations frequented by children such as schools, childcare facilities, playgrounds, and parks by restricting registered sex offenders from being within 500 feet of those locations. Chapman later moved into civil practice where he represented railroad companies and now maintains a practice in Tulsa focused on criminal defense and civil rights litigation. = Native American advocacy = Chapman is also a public advocate for Native Americans on the issues of sovereignty, the Native American mascot controversy, and the proper representation of Native Americans in both a historical and contemporary context.

Chapman discovered that administrators at Maine West had been claiming for years to have the endorsement of the Cherokee Nation to use the Native American imagery. After verifying that no such endorsement ever existed, he contacted a journalist at the Chicago Tribune, setting off social media chain reaction that brought Maine West into the long-running national debate over cultural appropriation. The Tribune ran the story on the front page of the April 6, 2018 edition with Chapman saying the mascot \\"trades on stereotypical images to serve as entertainment.\\" Chapman said this particular case was especially egregious because \\"these educators claim to have some moral authority from a nation, from a legally recognized tribe\\" to use the imagery, which he called \\"complete malarkey.\\" Maine West's Native American student population‚Äîthough a small percentage of the overall population‚Äîbacked the effort to remove the mascot and reached out to Chapman, providing him with other examples of offensive imagery from inside the school such as murals and totem poles by April 10. Chapman told reporters that \\"continuing to sanction the dance would be akin to the school choosing to honor a tradition of mockery over its students.\\" The controversy continued for the next three weeks until Maine West announced the retirement of the Native American mascot and imagery on May 1, 2018. Many in favour of keeping the mascot expressed dismay, saying the decision was \\"really disheartening\\" while others accused detractors of \\"wiping away history.\\" Chapman told the Tribune, \\"I commend the local administration for taking action very quickly\\" after administrators said their decision to make a change was in keeping with \\"the broader cultural shift\\" over Native American-themed mascots. On June 19, 2019, the Journal & Topics reported that all signs of Native American-themed imagery at Maine West was \\"fading away\\" in an article that included a photograph of a worker painting over a large Native American mural inside the school. In 2019, Chapman advocated against the controversial Life of Washington mural by Victor Arnautoff in San Francisco and applauded the June 2019 decision to paint over offensive imagery of George Washington and American settlers stepping over the dead body of a Native American.  Self-determination  In 2019, Chapman met with the President of Catalonia Quim Torra in Washington during the European leader's official visit to the United States. Torra, Chapman, and linguist Josep Alay discussed mutual issues facing Native Americans and Catalonia including language revitalization, cultural identity, human rights, and Catalonia's non-violent movement to determine its own future as a unique people in Europe. Chapman also requested that the Government of Catalonia denounce all Catalan-speaking colonizers who participated in Spanish abuses during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Afterward, Torra tweeted \\"Catalans always stand by the rights of Native American Nations,\\" and on April 29, 2019 the Government of Catalonia issued a condemnation of \\"the abuses committed against the populations and original peoples of the Americas\\" during European colonization, saying it \\"deplored\\" the role played by Catalan slave-traders. On November 28, 2018, Chapman led Native American criticism of Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell after he claimed the United States \\"only had to kill four Indians\\" to achieve independence and national unity. According to European media, \\"After quoting what he describes as a 'shocking idiocy,' Chapman asked 'what's the matter with this man?'\\" and Carles Puigdemont ‚Äî the former President of Catalonia now in exile following the 2017 Catalan independence referendum ‚Äî responded to Chapman, saying \\"'what's the matter with this man?' is exactly the same question most Catalans ask themselves.\\" In an interview with Barcelona media, Chapman said Borrell's comments exhibited \\"pure ignorance\\" and pointed to Spain's historical treatment of Native Americans saying, \\"Borrell should know that Spain killed a lot more people than four Indians.\\" The following day, Spanish Foreign Minister Borrell issued an apology to Native Americans ‚Äî in English.  Representation of Native Americans on present-day and historical issues  Chapman criticizes unfair or historically inaccurate portrayals of Native Americans in popular culture, including in 2019 criticism of historian David McCollough following the release of his book The Pioneers: The Heroic Story of the Settlers Who Brought the American Ideal West. Chapman told the Associated Press that McCullough merely repeated the same stereotypes to justify stealing Native American land that the pioneers did when they stole it. Chapman advocates for Native Americans in the national debate over the removal of statues, memorials and murals.Chang, Samantha. Controversy erupts as group aims to remove ‚Äòtraumatizing‚Äô George Washington murals from high school, BPR Business and Politics, May 3, 2019 Chapman points to the 2018 decision by the Republican- controlled Nebraska Legislature to remove a statue of a white male (William Jennings Bryan) from the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in favor of fellow Ponca Chief Standing Bear as setting the standard in representing Native Americans in the proper light, saying the non- partisan decision to honor a significant event in American history \\"will help spread the story and better help all Americans to understand our story.‚Äù He advocates changing Columbus Day to Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In 2018, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed a law changing the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day; however, former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin vetoed that legislationMummolo, Burt. Native Americans feel slapped in the face by Governor Fallin, 8ABC Tulsa, May 4, 2018 claiming that \\"combining a new Native American Day designation with the current Columbus Day holiday could be viewed as an intentional attempt to diminish the long-standing support of November being proclaimed annually as Native American Heritage Month.\\" Chapman said Fallin's veto of a nonpartisan bill \\"defied logic\\" and was a slap in the face to Native Americans in Oklahoma to deny them a day to commemorate their unique history. In 2019, the Philadelphia Inquirer interviewed Chapman for a Memorial Day article about 2nd Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, an officer with the 7th Cavalry buried in Philadelphia. Hodgson died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn alongside George Armstrong Custer in 1876. Chapman was asked whether Americans should honor soldiers who fought not in defense of country, but to dispossess native peoples of their land and their lives. Chapman responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think American soldiers who oppressed Native Americans should be honored, any more than Confederate soldiers should be honored for defending slavery. The excuse that American soldiers were just following orders during the Indian Wars is an excuse that is no longer acceptable. They knew what they were doing.‚Äù Chapman proposed that any such memorial should feature an explanatory plaque to offer a native perspective on any American soldier involved in the Indian Wars: ‚ÄúThey largely believed in the mission, which was fully rooted in white supremacism, as that was the foundation of the Indian policy of the United States. A full and fair understanding of history will help Americans understand Native Americans.‚Äù  See also  *Native American mascot controversy *Standing Bear *Catalan independence movement  Notes   References   External links  * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:21st-century Native Americans Category:Activists from Oklahoma Category:Criminal defense lawyers Category:Kiowa people Category:Lawyers from Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Native American lawyers Category:Native Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Native Americans' rights activists Category:Native American people Category:Oklahoma lawyers Category:Pawnee people Category:Ponca Category:Social justice activists Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:University of Tulsa College of Law alumni ","title":"Brett Chapman"},{"id":"61229987","text":"Quirine Lemoine and Arantxa Rus were the defending champions from the last time the tournament was held in 2017, but Lemoine chose not to participate this year.

In response to the challenge, Azgad decided, with the support of the Weizmann Institute of Science president, Prof. Daniel Zajfman, to organize the event in Tel Aviv under a new name: Science on Tap. This event, preceded by a creative ad campaign, included the participation of 70 scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science speaking in different bars, all at the same time, with free entrance for all. The wild success of this venture led to a significant change in the entertainment culture in Tel Aviv in particular and in Israel in general. Dozens of similar projects, all with the ‚Äúon Tap‚Äù format, (Doctors on Tap, Law on Tap, Knesset Members on Tap, Stock Market on Tap, etc.) were introduced.

His family emigrated to Sweden when he was a child. He currently lives with his family in Spain.  Career  Over the course of his career Lahyani officiated many high profile matches at both Grand Slam and ATP tournaments, including the 2013 Wimbledon Men's Singles Final, and the 2008, 2010, and 2013 ATP World Tour Finals' Finals.
