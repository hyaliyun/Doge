His remembrance day is September 28.Sunday, September 28, 2003 , St. Katherine the Great-Martyr Orthodox Mission Life =Sources= We know about his vita from the 6th-century \\"Life of Chariton\\", written by an anonymous monk, which holds elements supported by modern archaeological excavations. =Early life= Chariton was a native of Iconium in the Byzantine province of Lycaonia. Under the reign of Emperor Aurelian (270-275) he was tortured and came close to become a martyr during a persecution against Christians. Released from prison after Aurelian's death, he regretted not having died as a martyr. =Pharan near Jerusalem= After his release in 275, during a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and other holy places, Chariton was abducted by bandits and brought to a cave in the Wadi Qelt(Pharan Valley). Tradition states that his abductors died by drinking wine that was poisoned by a snake. Chariton decided to remain a hermit in the cave after this miraculous death of his abductors. There he built a church and established a monastery,Encyclopaedia Judaica, Thomson Gale (2007): Dok the first one of the lavra type. =Douka near Jericho= Later he moved to the Mount of Temptation near Jericho, where he established the lavra of Douka on the ruins of the Hasmonean and Herodian Dok Fortress. =Souka (Old Lavra at Wadi Khureitun/Tekoa)= Remains of Souka, Palestine After that he moved on to establish a third monastery in Wadi Khureitun, named the Souka and later known as the Old Lavra. In all three locations his fame let Christians flock to learn from him, disturbing his solitude, which was the reason for him repeatedly moving on. At Souka he eventually relocated to a cave on a cliff near the centre of the lavra, known as the \\"Hanging Cave of Chariton\\" and whose remains have been discovered by Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld. Legacy The importance of Chariton lays mainly in the fact that he established by his own example the rules for monastic life in the Judaean desert, in the context of lavra-type monasteries.Butler, Richard Urban. \\"Laura\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. Via www.newadvent.org.

The Black Tulip is a 2010 film directed by novice filmmaker Sonia Nassery Cole and starring Haji Gul Aser, Sonia Nassery Cole, Walid Amini, Jack Scalia, and Edoardo Costa. It is set in Afghanistan. Premise The film depicts the fictional Mansouri family who start a restaurant in Kabul named The Poets' Corner, where artists and writers meet. The story centers on Farishta (Cole), the woman who runs the cafe. The Poets' Corner serves wine in teapots and has poetry readings by locals and members of the U.S. military. This ultimately angers the Taliban and they begin kidnapping and assassinating the family and patrons of the cafe.

Cole then cast herself in the lead role instead. When questioned about the lack of evidence about the event, Cole later claimed that the actress had told her in a telephone call about the amputations, and said that the woman asked her to leave her alone for her own safety. However, Latif Ahmadi, the head of the Afghan Film Organization, said he thought Cole's statement was \\"propaganda for the film\\" and he didn't believe it had happened. According to an article in The New York Times, many others in the film industry in Kabul had said they had never heard of such an actress nor of such an episode. According to Cole, the film's cinematographer, a producer and a set designer had all abandoned her \\"in the middle of production.\\" Michael Carney, the production designer, who had worked on the film in Afghanistan for two months, said he completed his agreed upon contract which had him leaving four days before the film completed shooting. \\"I could feel death,\\" said Keith Smith, the original cinematographer. \\"I didn't sign up for that.\\" The film was largely financed by Cole. Reception The film premiered 23 September 2010, at the Ariana Cinema Theater in Kabul, Afghanistan. There were advance screenings at the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and at the embassy. Some Afghan attendees at the premiere challenged certain scenes in the film as not being faithful to Afghan culture or tradition. The film was selected for screening as Afghanistan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards but didn't make the January shortlist. Two songs featured in the film, \\"Forever One Love\\" and \\"Freedom Song\\", were also in contention for the Best Original Song Academy Award.

They have a threefold focus in education, research, and advocacy, to continue improving lives for all those with asthma. The vision of Asthma Canada is a future without asthma. Asthma Canada represents over 3.8 million Canadians living with asthma, along with their caregivers and all others impacted by asthma, and also provides resources for people suffering from allergies. History The Asthma Society of Canada was founded in 1973 to fill the need for an organization that was solely dedicated to relieving those suffering from asthma. The organization was a coalition, formed of asthma community members and leading Canadian researchers, with the purpose of using science and community support to help people with asthma lead better lives. At the time of founding, a Professional Advisory Committee was established by Dr. Cecil Collins-Williams of the Toronto General Hospital, Dr. Irvin Broder of the Gage Research Institute, and Dr. Harold Williams of the Crippled Children‚Äôs Centre. Asthma Canada continues its history of being driven by the scientific community, ensuring that all information they publish comes from valid sources and peer-reviewed studies. Once the non-profit status was attained, the ASC went straight into fundraising and kept their focus primarily in education. Since the founding of ASC, it has undergone significant developments. Its name was formally changed to Asthma Canada in 2017, and has broadened their focus to bring about support services, research, and advocacy. Mission The mission of Asthma Canada is to help Canadians with asthma lead healthy and active lives through education, advocacy, and research. Relying on donor support, Asthma Canada works toward: * Educating and informing people living with asthma * Engaging and empowering the asthma community * Supporting researchers working to find better asthma treatments * Advocating for awareness and change to improve healthcare for people with asthma * Striving for excellence in service delivery through best practices What They Do Asthma Canada seeks to cover all bases when it comes to helping Canadians with asthma. Educating the public continues to be a priority for AC, driving them to consistently release information about how to live well with asthma on their website and social media pages. Their focus on advocating for Canadians with asthma has brought them to an anti-coal clean air initiative, and urges for comprehensive healthcare on the part of the Canadian government to increase access to prescription medication. They currently head two research funds, the Dr. Goran Enhorning Asthma Research Fund and the Bastable-Potts Asthma Research Fund, amassing a total of $170,000 for graduate research since 2017.  Education  Asthma Canada‚Äôs website (asthma.ca) is a comprehensive resource for asthma education. The website includes information for those living with asthma as well as those who have loved ones with asthma, covering things such as asthma triggers, research and news, and creating an Asthma Action Plan. Hard-copies of their resources are available upon request, in both English and French.  Asthma and Allergy HelpLine  Asthma Canada provides a free call-back service connecting Canadians with Certified Respiratory Educators (CREs) via phone or email. CREs are located all across Canada and are experts in the field of asthma and allergy education. They can provide up-to-date information and personalized advice in both English and French about: * Newly diagnosed asthma * Managing asthma symptoms * Avoiding asthma triggers * Treatment options Contact Asthma Canada's Asthma and Allergy HelpLine by calling 1-866-787-4050.  The Asthma Canada Member Alliance  The Asthma Canada Member Alliance (ACMA), formerly known as the National Asthma Patient Alliance (NAPA) was founded in 2008 in Hamilton, Ontario. It is directed by a group of patient volunteers representing each province and territory in Canada. ACMA exists so that people with asthma can come together and do their part in education and advocacy so that others with their condition to get the help they deserve. The goal of ACMA is to increase patient awareness of how to achieve optimal asthma control, address communication and advocacy needs of asthma patients, and build a network of patient volunteers dedicated to improving asthma care and education.  Other Programs  Asthma Canada believes that all Canadians living with asthma should have equitable and timely access to prescription medications based on the best possible health outcomes rather than ability to pay. Asthma Canada spearheaded a letter writing campaign to the Canadian government to advocate for equitable access to prescription medication, and continues to participate in advocacy campaigns that affect Canadians with asthma.https://asthma.ca/access-medication-campaign/ Asthma Canada is the official Canadian partner of the Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification program, operated by Allergy Standards Limited,https://www.allergystandards.com/ which tests and certifies household products on a pass/fail basis for allergen reduction. Team Asthma is a brand which promotes asthma awareness and healthy lifestyles through participation in running races, triathlons, and other athletic competitions. Anyone with a connection to asthma is encouraged to join Team Asthma and wear the clothing during competitions. Asthma Canada runs the Asthma Ambassadors program,http://www.asthma.ca/getinvolved/ambassadors which allows interested Canadians an opportunity to volunteer spreading asthma information in their communities. This is done through peer-to-peer support, providing education packages to their friends, and placing them in visible community locations.

Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority have been taking place since September 2010 as part of the peace process, between United States President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The ultimate aim of the direct negotiations is reaching an official \\"final status settlement\\" to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict by implementing a two-state solution, with Israel remaining a Jewish state, and the establishment of a state for the Palestinian people. In early 2010, Benjamin Netanyahu, imposed a ten-month moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank as a gesture for the Palestinian Authority, after previously publicly declaring his support for a future Palestinian state, however he insisted that the Palestinians would need to make reciprocal gestures of their own. The Palestinian Authority rejected the gesture as insufficient. Nine month later, direct negotiations between Israel and the PA relaunched, after nearly two years of stalemate.\\"Direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders to begin,\\" Janine Zacharia, August 31, 2010, The Washington Post. In early September, a coalition of 13 Palestinian factions began a campaign of attacks against Israeli civilians, including a series of drive-by shootings and rocket attacks on Israeli towns, in an attempt to derail and torpedo the ongoing negotiations.\\"Islamist groups attempt to derail Middle East talks,\\" Mark Weiss, September 4, 2010, Irish Times. Direct talks broke down in late September 2010 when an Israeli partial moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank expired and Netanyahu refused to extend the freeze unless the Palestinian Authority recognized Israel as a Jewish State, while the Palestinian leadership refused to continue negotiating unless Israel extended the moratorium.PM Netanyahu's Speech at the Opening of the Knesset Winter Session, Embassy of Israel 12-10-2010 The proposal was rejected by the Palestinian leadership, that stressed that the topic on the Jewishness of the state has nothing to do with the building freeze. The decision of Netanyahu on the freeze was criticized by European countries and the United States.Palestinians quash PM's offer for renewed building freeze, Jerusalem Post 11-10-2010  Background  Direct negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government have continued for many decades and remain a complicated issue to resolve. When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, he has made peaceful settlement of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict a top priority of his administration, appointing former Senator George Mitchell as his peace envoy. In March 2009 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Israel. She said that Israeli settlements and demolition of Arab homes in East Jerusalem were \\"unhelpful\\" to the peace process. Clinton also voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu supports Palestinian self- government but did not explicitly endorse US and Palestinian visions for Palestinian statehood. Upon the arrival of President Obama administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu stated that any resumption of negotiations with the Palestinians will be conditional on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state. So far the Palestinian leadership has rejected a US-backed proposal extending a settlement freeze in exchange for recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, as this issue had not been sufficiently clarified by Israel at that time. On June 4, 2009 Obama delivered a speech at the Cairo University in Egypt in which Obama addressed the Muslim world. The speech called for a \\"new beginning\\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States. With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the President stated that \\"the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states\\" and called upon both Israel and the Palestinians to resume negotiations. In addition, during the speech Obama added that \\"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements\\" as it \\"undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.\\"Remarks by the President On a New Beginning, The White House 4-6-2009 On June 14, in what was understood as a response Obama's Cairo speech, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed, for the first time, a \\"Demilitarized Palestinian State\\", after two months of refusing to commit to anything other than a self-ruling autonomy when coming into office. Netanyahu also stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel but open to all religions, the Palestinians would have no military, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also claimed the right for a \\"natural growth\\" in the existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. In general, the address was viewed as a significant turnaround from his previously hawkish positions against the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. On July 12, 2009, Mahmoud Abbas told Egyptian media that he would not cede any part of the West Bank to Israel, that he would demand territorial contiguity between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and that he would never waive the Palestinian right of return. In a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, Abbas demanded that any peace deal be based strictly on the 1967 borders and the Arab Peace Initiative. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat rejected any \\"middle ground solutions\\", saying that the Palestinians would reject any deal between the U.S. and Israel that would allow any construction to continue in Israeli settlements. On 23 August 2009, Netanyahu announced in his weekly cabinet meeting that negotiations with the Palestinians will begin in September 2009 and will be officially launched on his visit to New York, after he had accepted an invitation from President Barack Obama for a \\"Triple Summit\\" there. He added that there is progress with special envoy George Mitchell, though there is no full agreement on everything, and there will be more rounds of meetings until September. On the same day, a spokesman for PA President Mahmoud Abbas said there would be no negotiations so long as Israel continued West Bank settlement construction. On 20 September 2009, the White House announced that it will host a three-way meeting between President Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu and PA President Mahmoud Abbas, within the framework of the United Nations General Assembly, \\"in an effort to lay the groundwork for renewed negotiations on Mideast peace.\\" The meeting took place on 22 September, in New York. Afterwards, Netanyahu said that he agreed with Abbas during the meeting that peace talks should be relaunched as soon as possible.  2010‚Äì2011 Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace talks  On 25 November 2009, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, imposed a 10-month construction freeze on all of its settlements in the West Bank. Calling it \\"a painful step that will encourage the peace process\\" and urged the Palestinians to respond. Israel's decision was widely seen as due to pressure from the Obama administration, which urged the sides to seize the opportunity to resume talks. The Palestinian Authority rejected the gesture as being insignificant due to the limited construction on some pre-approved housing units, failure to extend the freeze to East Jerusalem, and failure to dismantle already-built settlement outposts illegal under Israeli law.PLO Negotiations Affairs Department, April 2010, \\"Israel's Violations of the Road Map, Jan 1 ‚Äì March 31, 2010,\\" http://www.nad-plo.org/news-updates/NSUSummaryIsraeliRMViolations_Jan- Mar2010_.pdf The Palestinians refused to enter negotiations, despite Israeli appeals to do so. A partial freeze on construction in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1980, and regards as its sovereign territory, was imposed under the observation of U.S. consular officials, though not acknowledged by the Israeli government.Briefing by Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mithcell , U.S. State Department 25-11-2009 On 19 July, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu froze a major construction project in Pisgat Ze'ev as a \\"diplomatic gesture\\" to the United States. However, some construction continued, and the Obama administration voiced disappointment over the matter, stating that it viewed construction there as a violation of the settlement freeze. On 10 March 2010, Israel approved the construction of 1,600 apartments in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood during a visit by US Vice President Joe Biden, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Israel and the United States. A partial step towards full negotiations took place around the middle of March 2010, as Israeli and Palestinian teams began indirect negotiations through US intermediaries.State Department Daily Press Briefing - March 15, 2010 These negotiations were interrupted within few days by the Palestinian Authority in protest of Israeli actions in East Jerusalem. They were renewed in May of that year.State Department Daily Press Briefing - May 10, 2010 On 10 May 2010, Israel joined the OECD. Previously, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad had written to the organization, urging it to suspend Israel's application, and before the vote, called numerous OECD heads of state to lobby against Israeli membership. Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki also wrote to OECD members that accepting Israel would legitimize its \\"racist\\" and \\"dangerous\\" policies towards Palestinians. On 31 May 2010, relations between Israel and the Palestinians were further strained when Israel carried out the Gaza flotilla raid. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated that \\"Israel has committed a massacre\\", and declared a three-day mourning period. Palestinian official Mustafa Barghouti said that the attack would lead to the international boycott growing in strength, and called Israel \\"the most despicable state in the world\\". Prime Minister Salam Fayyad also criticized the attack. On 8 July 2010, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the Arab League that the Palestinian Authority would abandon peace talks and attack Israel if the Arab states would invade, saying \\"if you want war, and if all of you will fight Israel, we are in favor. But the Palestinians will not fight alone because they don't have the ability to do it\\". In August 2010 Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton stated that a Palestinian state was possible to achieve within one year. A renewed effort to negotiate peace was initiated by the Obama administration by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks for the first time in a long while. U.S. President Barack Obama was successful in obtaining support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The Egyptian and Jordanian governments managed to persuade the Palestinian leadership to accept Israel's settlement freeze and enter direct talks nine months after the start of the freeze. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year on a two-state solution, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. On September 2, after ten months and seven rounds of indirect talks that began in November 2009, U.S.-brokered direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority began in Washington D.C.An insider's view of the peace process: A Palestinian perspective, Brookings Doha Center 8-12-2010 On September 14 a second round of Middle East peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority concluded in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas stated that during the talks, the Palestinian Authority and Israel agreed on the principle of a land swap, with Israel exchanging small parts of its own territory in exchange for border settlement blocs. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping border settlement blocs was an issue of dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel offering less. During the direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Hamas and Hezbollah reaffirmed to threat peace talks if both sides were matriculated towards any possible agreement. A Hamas-led coalition of 13 Palestinian militant groups initiated a violent campaign to disrupt peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. A series of attacks killed and wounded eight Israelis, including two pregnant women, between August and September 2010. Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces responded with raids that resulted in the deaths and arrests of militants involved in the attacks. Rocket and mortar attacks from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip also increased in September. On September 21, 2010 Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad stormed out of a meeting in New York, which was held as part of the ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meetings, and canceled a scheduled joint press conference with the Israeli President Shimon Peres and Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon following Ayalon's demand that the meeting summary refer to the notion of \\"two states for two peoples\\", meaning Israel as a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state, rather than a Palestinian state alongside a bi-national Israel.http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/09/the_arabs_are_still_stuck_on_r.html The Arabs Are Still Stuck on Rejection Ayalon later commented on the event, stating: \\"What I say is that if the Palestinians are not willing to talk about two states for two peoples, let alone a Jewish state for Israel, then there's nothing to talk about\\", and that \\"if the Palestinians think that they can create one Palestinian state and one dual-nationality state, this will not happen\\".Fayyad storms out of New York meeting with Ayalon, Jerusalem Post President Obama indicated in a speech to the United Nations he held on September 23, 2010 that he was hopeful of a diplomatic peace within one year. Contrary to popular belief, Israel did not boycott the speech, but did not attend due to the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. As the Israeli 10-month freeze on settlement construction was nearing its expiration date on September 26, Mahmoud Abbas stated that he would abandon the negotiations if settlement construction was renewed. He said \\"Israel has a moratorium for 10 months and it should be extended for three to four months more to give peace a chance.\\" In the view of the Palestinian Authority leadership, Israeli construction of settlements constitutes Israel's imposition of \\"facts on the ground\\" in the West Bank, and is a violation of international law.BBC News, 2003 Apr. 29, \\"Excerpts of Palestinian PM's Maiden Speech,\\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2986895.stm See generally, International law and Israeli settlements On September 22, the Knesset passed a law requiring a public referendum and the votes of at least 60 Knesset members ahead of any withdrawal from East Jerusalem or the Golan Heights. The law was criticized by the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League. On September 25, a day before the Israeli settlement freeze's expiration, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas claimed in the United Nations General Assembly that Israeli settlements were a key issue, stating that \\"Israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements\\". The United States pushed Israel to extend the settlement freeze. Despite Palestinian and international pressure to extend the Israeli 10-month moratorium in construction of new Israeli settlement homes in the West Bank, on September 26 the ten-month settlement freeze expired at 22.00 (GMT). Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on West Bank settlers to \\"show restraint\\" following the end of the freeze. Several Israeli right-wing politicians called for a swift resumption of construction, and backed settlers' plans to resume building as soon as possible. Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Foreign Minister and leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, rebuffed claims that the renewal of West Bank settlement construction was a provocative move meant to torpedo the peace talks. Lieberman said the Palestinians failed to accept the gesture of the moratorium for nine months and \\"now they are pressuring Israel to continue the very freeze they rejected.\\" Lieberman said Israel was ready to enter peace talks with no preconditions.http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=189452 PM silent amid world criticism of moratorium's end Lieberman also ruled out that a Palestinian state will be established in the coming of two years. The rejection to extend the moratorium was harshly criticized worldwide.Haaretz, 2010 Nov. 29, EU's Ashton: Israel Must Extend Settlement Freeze to Give Talks a Chancehttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2010-12-31/content_1493279.htmlHaaretz, 2010 Oct. 18, \\"UN: Settlement Building Contradicts Efforts to Achieve Mideast Peace: UN Assistant secretary General Tells Council Session that Israel's Decision to Build 238 New Housing Units Violates International Law.\\" http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/un-settlement-building- contradicts-efforts-to-achieve-mideast- peace-1.319860http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=189854 PM supports continued talks: 'We have a mission for peace Abbas stated that Netanyahu cannot be trusted as a 'genuine' peace negotiator if the freeze is not extended. On October 2, 2010 the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated that peace negotiations will not continue until Israel imposes a new freeze for the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, thus putting an de facto halt to the current Israel-Palestine peace negotiations. On October 4, 2010, Netanyahu stated that the Israelis were working behind the scenes with the United States to resolve the issues and resume talks. Israeli sources had said that this would involve a 60-day extension of the freeze. Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said that the United States had offered Israel \\"incentives\\" for an extension of the freeze. Chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath accepted a US proposal to extend the West Bank settlement freeze by another two months. Sha'ath said the Palestinians accept such a limited extension provided the two sides can reach an agreement on the borders between Israel and a future Palestine in those two months.Sha'ath: Palestinians accept US freeze extension proposal, The Jerusalem Post After a meeting in Libya on 8 October 2010, the Arab League leaders announce their support for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's decision to stop peace talks with Israel over the expiration of the 10 month Israeli moratorium on construction in the West Bank. The Arab League also stated that it would give the United States another month to persuade Israel to renew the settlement moratorium and that \\"The committee will convene again in a month to study the alternatives\\". On 11 October 2010, during a speech at the opening of the third session of the 18th Knesset, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a settlement freeze if the Palestinian Authority would declare its recognition of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people. The Palestinian Authority quickly rejected Netanyahu's proposal and stated that the issue of the Jewishness of the state has nothing to do with the matter. The proposal was immediately rejected by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian President Abbas said that \\"We will never sign an agreement recognizing a Jewish state\\", and Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that Palestinian President Abbas stressed that he would never sign an agreement recognizing Israel as a Jewish state\\". Speaking on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat stated on October 11 that the PA \\"forcefully reject all these Israeli games. The racist demands of Netanyahu cannot be tied to the request to cease building in the settlements for the purpose of establishing a state.\\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=191083 'Both sides must take steps for negotiations to continue' Palestinian negotiators announced that their recognition of the Jewish state would undermine the rights of Israeli-Arabs, and eliminate the right of return for millions of Palestinian refugees to Israel proper. On October 15, it was reported that Israel had approved new construction in East Jerusalem. On 13 October 2010 Yasser Abed Rabbo, the secretary general of the PLO, stated in a press statement that the PLO would recognize Israel as a \\"Jewish state\\" in exchange for a sovereign Palestinian state within the 1967 borders which would include East Jerusalem stating that \\"Any formulation the Americans present ‚Äì even asking us to call Israel the 'Chinese State' ‚Äì we will agree to it, as long as we receive the 1967 borders. We have recognized Israel in the past, but Israel has not recognized the Palestinian state.\\" Abed Rabbo's statements were immediately disowned by the Palestinian political factions, mainly because his remark were viewed as conceding the right of return for millions of Palestinian refugees to Israel proper. The Fatah movement called for Abed Rabbo's immediate resignation. Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath dismissed Abed Rabbo's statements and claimed that \\"Abed Rabbo's statements don't represent the views of the PLO or Fatah movement or President Abbas\\". In addition, the Hamas government in Gaza called for the immediate resignation of Abed Rabbo. In November 2010, the U.S. government offered Israel a package of incentives in exchange for an agreement by the Israeli government to a 90-day freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem. The centerpiece of the deal was a military aid package worth $3 billion, including delivery of 20 additional F-35s,various missile and layered defense systems, and an explicit acceptance of the legitimacy of existing security needs and a commitment not to redefine them.Dear Prime Minister: U.S. Efforts to Keep the Peace Process on Track, PolicyWatch #1701 29-9-2010 In addition to security provisions, the proposed incentive package also included a U.S. promise to veto any U.N.

For the first time in memory, the United States is poised to reward Israel for its bad behavior.\\" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the U.S. freeze proposal, as it did not include East Jerusalem, while Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated demands for unconditional recognition of the 1967 borders, and for withdrawal from all of East Jerusalem. On December 2, a Palestinian official announced that Washington had officially informed the PA that Israel had refused to agree to a new settlement freeze.Al Jazeera, 2010 Dec. 5, \\"Brazil Recognises Palestine,\\" http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/12/201012504256198565.html Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak tried to restart negotiations by imposing a de facto settlement freeze by blocking building plans in the West Bank settlements. Ariel Mayor Ron Nachman threatened to sue Barak. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Egypt and met with President Hosni Mubarak. Netanyahu urged Mubarak to pressure Abbas into direct talks. According to Dr. Mohammad Shtayyeh, a senior Palestinian negotiator who spoke at a conference hosted by the Brookings Institution's Doha Center, the Palestinian leadership used the cessation of direct talks to adopt a new strategy with the goal of declaring an independent state of Palestine. The initial step of this strategy was to ask the international community to recognize an independent Palestine along 1967 borders, to which the achieved some success in late 2010 and early 2011. Several Latin American countries recognized the State of Palestine, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Uruguay.Chile Offers Recognition for a State of Palestine, The New York Times 7-1-2011 This was met with fierce opposition from Israel, which claimed that early recognition was a violation of the Road Map. In January 2011, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman proposed an interim peace deal, in which a Palestinian state would be established initially on 50% of the West Bank, with final borders to be negotiated at a later date. The proposal was rejected by the Palestinians, with Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat claiming that Lieberman's plan represented Prime Minister Netanyahu's position as well, stating \\"the Israeli government is not headed towards peace, because it is not interested in peace, and this plan is proof of that\\". On January 16, 2011, Israel presented to accept a plan to build some 1400 more homes in Gilo, a neighborhood in east Jerusalem, bringing condemnation from the Palestinians and Israeli left. In February 2011, Israel offered to ease economic and security restrictions against the Palestinians, which reportedly included allowing additional Arab construction in East Jerusalem, giving the Palestinian Authority security control in seven West Bank cities, and discussing a proposed Palestinian Authority gas field alongside an Israeli one off the coast of Gaza, on condition that the Palestinian Authority resume direct talks. The proposal was agreed to by Middle East Quartet chief Tony Blair, and rejected by the Palestinians. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the Israeli proposal \\"just a trick and procrastination\\", stating that \\"what Netanyahu should do, if he wants to build confidence, is immediately stop settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and recognize a Palestinian state on the territories occupied in 1967\\", called on Western nations to \\"stop dealing with Israel as if it is above the law\\", and \\"reach a historic decision that will recognize a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital\\", and urged the Quartet to force Israel to halt settlement construction \\"including in Jerusalem\\". The following day, Israel approved the construction of 13 additional Jewish homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Shortly afterward, the Palestinian Authority announced an initiative to United Nations to recognize Hebron and Bethlehem as world heritage sites rather than Jewish heritage sites to prevent \\"Judaization\\". PA officials told local media that they hoped such recognition would stop the growth of Jewish settlements in the cities. Turkey assisted the initiative by providing archived Ottoman documents showing various sites in the two cities under Muslim rule. Researchers from Lebanon and Italy have also supported the initiative. On 12 February 2011, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat announced his resignation over the Palestine Papers scandal, which purportedly showed that he had agreed to wide-ranging concessions to Israel on the issues of Jerusalem, refugees, borders, and Israeli security, while still insisting that the documents were false. On 18 February 2011, the United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice indicated in her remarks that the purpose of the U.S. veto was to demonstrate the Obama administration's intention that \\"the only way to reach that common goal [of peace] is through direct negotiations.\\"Explanation of Vote by Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on the Resolution on the Situation in the Middle East, including the question of Palestine, in the Security Council Chamber , United States Mission to the United Nations 18-2-2011 This was met with mixed reactions by the Israeli and Palestinian leadership, as Netanyahu stated Israel's appreciation of the veto, while the Palestinian Authority condemned the U.S. for its \\"bias\\".PM Netanyahu Remarks on UNSC Vote, Embassy of Israel 20-2-2011 In March 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly considered a temporary peace deal that would see a Palestinian state established within provisional borders, with future borders negotiated at a later date, due to the Palestinians' refusal to negotiate. On March 3, the Palestinians rejected the idea, with official Saleh Ra'fat saying that the PLO's position is unchangeable, and President Abbas calling it \\"unacceptable\\". Following the impasse in negotiations, the Palestinian Authority announced that unless a deal was reached by September 2011, it would unilaterally declare independence, seek recognition by the United Nations, and apply for membership in the organization. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas claimed that this new state would be ready to negotiate all the core issues, and that a key focus would be finding a \\"just solution\\" for Palestinian refugees in accordance with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194. The Palestinian Authority subsequently refused to reenter negotiations or reconsider its plans for a declaration of statehood until Israel froze all settlement construction and agreed to a solution based on the 1967 borders. PLO official Yasser Abed Rabbo claimed that the new Palestinian state would not tolerate an Israeli military and civilian presence on its land, and would seek UN intervention. In April 2011, Fatah and Hamas signed a unity agreement, and announced plans to form a joint government. Israel responded by temporarily freezing the transfer of customs funds Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, but released them following guarantees that the money would not go to Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Palestinian Authority that it would have to choose between peace with Israel or peace with Hamas. Abbas accepted a French offer to host peace talks by July 2011.Berger, Robert. \\"Palestinians Accept French Proposal for Mideast Talks.\\" VoA, 4 June 2011. A few days later, US Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, announced plans to introduce legislation that would withhold US contributions to any UN entity that recognizes a Palestinian state or upgrades the status of the PLO observer mission. She claimed that this was in order to \\"oppose efforts by the Palestinian leadership to evade a negotiated settlement with Israel.\\" In July 2011, the Quartet on the Middle East convened, but did not come out with a statement. Israeli officials disclosed that the Quartet was unable to reach a statement following the Palestinians' refusal to accept clauses in the planned statement calling on the Palestinian Authority to withdraw its plans for a unilateral declaration of independence in September, to halt all demands from Israel once a two-state solution was reached, end incitement against Israel, or recognize it as a Jewish state. In May 2012, Abbas reiterated his readiness to engage with the Israelis if they propose \\"anything promising or positive\\".  Public reactions  = The reactions of the Israeli public = In May 2011, a poll of 500 Israelis, commissioned by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, found that 77% opposed going back to pre-'67 lines; that 85% and 75%, respectively, supported keeping all of Jerusalem under Israeli control within the framework of any peace agreement and opposed transferring the Temple Mount to Palestinian control, even if the Western Wall were to remain in Israeli hands; that 84% believed Israel must maintain control of the Jordan Valley, even in the framework of a final peace agreement; that 60% believed that defensible borders would ensure security more than a peace agreement would; and 82% considered security concerns more important than a peace deal. = The reactions of the Palestinian public = A 2011 poll found that 61% of Palestinians opposed and 34% supported the idea of \\"two states for two peoples.\\" Some 66% agreed with the two-state solution, but only as a first step to the elimination of Israel. Though quotes in the Hamas Charter urging the elimination of Israel were found to be highly supported, most Palestinians supported idea of peace talks over violence. On 29 October 2010, tens of thousands of Islamic Jihad supporters participated in a demonstration in Gaza City's Kuteiba Square against the negotiations and making peace with Israel. The rally was organized by Islamic Jihad and enjoyed the participation of its rival, Hamas. Demonstrators shouted \\"Death to America and Death to Israel\\". Islamic Jihad chief Ramadan Shallah sent a recorded message saying that \\"Israel will not bring peace to the region, it will only bring war and destruction and therefore, the slogan of all should be that Israel must be wiped out of existence,\\" and \\"The choice of negotiation has reached deadlock, and we are wondering why is there such an insistence by the Palestinian Authority on negotiation with the enemy [i.e., Israel]\\". Another leader, Mohammad al-Hindi, called for an end to the Palestinian Authority, and said, \\"Jihad is the fate of this nation. There is no other option but this one\\".

He was knighted on 15 July 1641 and created baronet, of Shardeloes on 17 July 1641. He was re-elected to Amersham in 1641 in the Long Parliament and was excluded in Pride's Purge in 1648. The exclusion was nominal, however: Drake was very unwilling to come off the fence at the beginning of the First English Civil War, and in 1643 applied for leave to travel abroad. He was out of the country for most of the period to 1660. He was re-elected for Amersham in 1661 and held the seat until his death. Drake died unmarried at the age of 63 and his estates passed to his nephew Sir William Drake. Legacy A collection of commonplace books was discovered at Shardloes in 1643, but was first identified with William Tothill, who had served as steward to Francis Bacon. As such they were purchased by C. K. Ogden, who left them to University College, London. They were identified as Drake's in 1976. With other materials from the collections, manuscripts that have been identified subsequently, and some of Drake's books that have survived with annotations, Sharpe has called Drake's legacy \\"the greatest archival resource we have to chart how an early modern English gentleman read\\".Sharpe, pp. 73‚Äì5.

It was written between 1878, an important year for the League of Prizren and 1880. The poet, a critique of religious and political factionalism as a barrier to national unity of Albanians called for them overcoming religious divisions through a united Albanianism. In 1910, the music director of the orchestra of Vlor√´ melodized the poem.. Poem Written in Vaso's native dialect of Shkod√´r, the poem is one of the few works written by him in Albanian. Others were penned in Italian or French. It has 72 verses. Vasa, a Catholic himself describes Albania, a nation whose people were divided between different religions and its fate. Vasa used the last line of poem Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) to remind his people that the identity of Albanians was not a product of religion as in the case of other peoples in the Balkans. He describes the nation as a mother and a grand lady that has been raped and defiled by foreigners. By using this feminine image of Albania and by appealing to the manly virtues of Albanians, Vasa in poetic verse demands from them to act against this dishonour. Versions The poem was first published by the Czech linguist in his work Zur Albanesische Sprachenkunde published in 1881. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, it was disseminated in the form of brochures and flyers. Two other versions have been found in Thimi Mitko's archives in Alexandria and those of Jeronim de Rada in Cosenza. Found in 1975, the latter version, unlike the other two, has a different first verse, which is Mori Shqypni instead of Moj Shqypni. It was originally considered to have been transcribed by Vasa, but eventually it was proven that it's a transcription of Sami Frash√´ri, another important Albanian writer of the era.. Importance and legacy Frustrated by Albanian societal divisions, the poem was a stirring appeal by Vasa for an national awakening and unity transcending religious and other identities among Albanians. O Moj Shqypni is considered to be one of the most influential works of 19th-century Albanian literature and has been described as one of the most influential and most important poems written in Albanian.; . The last stanza Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) was a motto of the League of Prizren and became during the Rilindja and thereafter a catchword for Albanian nationalists. The communist leader of Albania Enver Hoxha, who used nationalism as a tool during his struggle to break Albania out of the Soviet bloc exploited the stanza and implemented it literally as state policy.... The communist regime proclaimed that the only religion of the Albanians was Albanianism. In 1967 the communist regime declared Albania the only atheist and non-religious country in the world and banned all forms of religious practice in public... \\"Henceforth, Hoxha announced, the only religion would be \\"Albanianism.\\" Hoxha was using nationalism as a weapon in his struggle to break out of the Soviet bloc.\\".

He became involved in an antiquarian dispute between his friend William Camden and Ralph Brooke. Life Vincent was born presumably in Northamptonshire, about 1584, third and youngest son of William Vincent (died 1618) and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Mabbott of Walgrave, merchant of the staple. He early obtained a post in the Tower of London. He had access to the documents preserved there and occupied himself in making extracts from them. He became known as an antiquary, and on 22 February 1616 was appointed by patent Rouge Rose pursuivant extraordinary. The College of Arms was at this time quarrelsome. Vincent was the friend of William Camden, who in 1618 appointed him his deputy to visit Northamptonshire and Rutland, thereby annoying those of the opposite party, some of whom were passed over in favour of a younger man. The practice of visitation by deputy was in 1619 the subject of a formal complaint on the part of Sir William Segar, Garter King of Arms, and Sir Richard St. George, Norroy King of Arms to the Earl Marshal. Camden, however, was able to justify himself. Vincent was constituted Rouge Croix pursuivant by patent of 29 May 1621, and on 5 June 1624 he became Windsor herald. He died on 11 January 1626, and was buried at the church of St Benet, Paul's Wharf. Works Vincent's only publication arose from his taking part on the side of Camden in his quarrel with Ralph Brooke. Brooke's Discoverie, his first printed denunciation of Camden, appeared in 1599; the fifth edition of Camden's Britannia, containing a reply, in 1600; and Brooke's Catalogue of Kings, Princes, continuing the squabble, in 1619 (2nd edition, enlarged, 1622). In reply to Brooke's Catalogue Vincent produced his Discoverie of Errours in the first edition of Catalogue of Nobility published by Ralfe Brooke, Yorke Herald... at the end whereof is annexed a Review of a later edition by him Stolne into the World, 1621, London, 1622. This volume, like the first (but not the second) edition of Brooke's Catalogue, was printed by William Jaggard. On his printer, Jaggard, Brooke had blamed for some of the errors in the first edition of his Catalogue. In his Discoverie, Vincent gave Jaggard space to reply to Brooke's comments on his skill as a printer. When, in 1623, Jaggard completed the printing of the first folio edition of Shakespeare, he presented to Vincent one of the earliest copies that came from the press.University of Toronto Libraries, British Armorial Bindings Retrieved 16 December 2015 Vincent also made collections for a baronage of England, called the Herœâologia Anglica, on which his son John afterwards worked. William Burton, the historian of Leicestershire, and John Weever, author of Ancient Funeral Monuments, both speak of help from Vincent. Vincent's collections found their way, through his son and then through Ralph Sheldon, into the possession of the College of Arms. Family Vincent married, on 30 June 1614, Elizabeth, third daughter of Vincent Primount of Canterbury, who came originally from Bivill la Baignard in Normandy. She married, before November 1630, Eusebius Catesby of Castor, Northamptonshire, and died on 6 August 1667. His son was also an antiquary.

It stars Sean Penn and Frances McDormand. The film deals with a middle-aged wealthy rock star who becomes bored in his retirement and takes on the quest of finding his father's tormentor, a Nazi war criminal who is a refugee in the United States. The film was an Italian-majority production with co-producers in France and Ireland. Principal photography began in August, 2010. Filming took place in Ireland and Italy, as well as the states of Michigan, New Mexico, and New York. The film was in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Cheyenne is a wealthy former rock star, now bored and jaded in his 20-year retirement in Dublin. He retired after two of his teenaged fans committed suicide. He travels to New York to reconcile with his estranged father during his final hours, only to arrive too late. The reason he gives for not communicating with his father for 30 years was that his father rejected him when he put on goth make-up at the age of 15. He reads his father's diary and learns about his father's persecution in Auschwitz at the hands of former SS officer Alois Lange. He visits a professional Nazi hunter named Mordecai Midler who tells him that Lange is small fry. Cheyenne begins a journey across the United States to track down Lange. Cheyenne finds the wife of Lange, Lange's granddaughter and a businessman. He buys a large gun. At the gun shop, a bystander delivers a soliloquy about a certain type of pistol that allows people to \\"kill with impunity,\\" and given that ability, \\"if we‚Äôre licensed to be monsters we end up having just one desire ‚Äì to truly be monsters.\\" When Cheyenne eventually tracks Lange down with the aid of Mordecai, Lange, now blind, says that he received hate mail from Cheyenne's father for decades. Lange recounts the incident that led to Cheyenne's father's obsession with Lange, in which Cheyenne's father peed his pants from fear. Lange describes this as a \\"minor incident\\" in comparison to the true horrors of Auschwitz, but mentions that he came to admire the man's single-minded determination to dedicate his life to making his own miserable. Cheyenne takes a photo of Lange and whispers that it was an injustice for his father to die before Lange did. Cheyenne forces the old blind man to walk out into the salt flats naked, like a Holocaust victim; skin and bones and numb with fear. Cheyenne and Mordecai drive away soon afterwards, leaving him still standing in the flats. Cheyenne travels home via airplane (something he previously feared), cuts his rockstar hair and stops wearing his goth make-up, jewelry and outfits.

To add an element of irony to a story about such a person, Sorrentino came up with Penn's character: \\"a slow, lazy, rock star who was bored enough and closed in his self-referential world to the point of being, seemingly, the last person who would embark on a crazy search for a Nazi criminal, probably dead by now, across the United States.\\" Sorrentino was attracted to this juxtaposition as it would add a great risk of failure, which he considers vital for the prospect of a story to be good. In selecting the name of the rock star and his band, Sorrentino thought of what he considered the most inspired names in rock star history, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and changed it into \\"Cheyenne and the Fellows\\". The look of the character was inspired by Robert Smith of The Cure. Sorrentino had seen The Cure perform several times in his youth, and when he saw them again in 2008, he was fascinated by the fact that Smith, even off the stage, still wore the same kind of attire as in the past: \\"Here was a fifty-year-old who still completely identified with a look which, by definition, is that of an adolescent. But there was nothing pathetic about it. There was just this one thing that, in the movies and in life, creates an incredible feeling of wonder: the extraordinary, a unique and thrilling exception.\\" As soon as the screenplay was finished, Sorrentino sent it to Penn, who accepted the starring role. This Must Be the Place was Sorrentino's first film to be shot in English. The film had a production budget of US$28 million. Production was led by the three Italian companies Indigo Film, Lucky Red and Medusa Film. Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo invested ‚Ç¨2.5 million ($3 million) in the film, while Eurimages provided ‚Ç¨600,000 ($750,000) in funding. The film also received funding from France and Ireland. Principal photography began on 16 August 2010 in Dublin, Ireland. In September, production moved to Michigan where filming took place in Bad Axe, Ubly, Kinde and Sterling Heights. Filming in New Mexico began in October and took place in Bingham, Alamogordo, Carrizozo, Eagle Nest, Red River and Questa. Post-production took place in Rome. Original music for the film was written by David Byrne, formerly of Talking Heads. The title of the film is a tribute to the Talking Heads song \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\". The original songs for the film are co-written with indie singer- songwriter Will Oldham. New York-based singer songwriter Michael Brunnock sings these songs for which they won a David di Donatello award.O'Neal, Sean (2012). \\"David Byrne and Will Oldham are Pieces Of Shit\\", The A.V.

It grows to a length of , which is too small for it to be fished for. The juvenile form was first described in 1885, with the description of the adult following in 1888 as a result of the Challenger expedition. Description S. pygmaeus is the smallest slipper lobster species, with a carapace length of for females, and for males. The total body length can reach , but is typically less than . Its small size precludes S. pygmaeus from being a target for fisheries. The body of S. pygmaeus is \\"pale brownish or pinkish with patches of darker hairs\\". S. pygmaeus resembles a young individual of Scyllarus arctus, with which it occurs in sympatry. The two species can be distinguished by a suite of characters: *The anterior part of the abdominal tergites have a groove lined with hairs in S. pygmaeus but not in S. arctus. *S. arctus has a forward- pointing, pointed tip to the second abdominal sternites, while in S. pygmaeus it is rounded and points backwards. *S. pygmaeus has a conical tubercle on the fifth thoracic somite, while the tubercle is compressed rather than conical in S. arctus. *The sculptured posterior part of the first abdominal somite is wider in the centre than at the edges in S. pygmaeus, while in S. arctus it is an even width throughout. Distribution and ecology Scyllarus pygmaeus has a wide distribution in the Mediterranean Sea and islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands. It has not been observed off the coast of North Africa further east than Morocco. It lives at depths of , where it is nocturnal and at its shallower ranges lives in Posidonia meadows. Females carry eggs in June and August. Taxonomic history Scyllarus pygmaeus was first described in 1888 by Charles Spence Bate as part of the results of the Challenger expedition. He based his description of \\"Arctus pygmaeus\\" on material from \\"off Gomera\\" in the Canary Islands. In the same publication, he also described \\"Arctus immaturus\\" from the Cape Verde archipelago, which Eug√®ne Louis Bouvier realised in 1915 was simply the \\"nisto\\" (juvenile) stage of S. pygmaeus. Applying the principle of first reviser, Bouvier established that S. pygmaeus would be the valid name, over S. immaturus. Although S. pygmaeus is not rare in the Mediterranean Sea, its presence there was overlooked for decades, due to the confusion between it and the more conspicuous S. arctus, whose immature form S. pygmaeus was often assumed to be. In 1960, Jacques Forest and Lipke Holthuis demonstrated for the first time that S. pygmaeus does indeed occur in the Mediterranean Sea, from museum specimens at the ' in Naples. The juvenile \\"nisto\\" form of S. pygmaeus was named earlier than the adult form; Sarado described it in 1885 under the name Nisto laevis in his 1885 work ' (\\"Study of the crustaceans of Nice\\"). The English vernacular name preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is pygmy locust lobster, alongside the French ' and the Spanish '.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical, high-altitude grassland, shrub-dominated wetlands, swamps, intermittent freshwater marshes, rural gardens, urban areas, and heavily degraded former forests. The cream-backed poison frog is one of the less-toxic of the family. It has undergone several name changes since its discovery. Originally called Dendrobates subpunctatus, its name was changed to Colostethus subpuctatus once the family Dendrobatidae underwent a division of species and genera other than Dendrobates were coined. Recently, minor skeletal differences have separated the cream-backed poison frog from the rocket frogs, and placed it in another genus entirely, Hyloxalus.  Toxin  Like many of the genus Hyloxalus, H. subpunctatus possesses fairly weak toxins, compared to those of other dendrobatids. It may be one of the most primitive of dendrobatids, as it has only begun to develop skin alkaloids and is still fairly drab in coloration. Its poison is already an effective defense mechanism; if tasted by a predator, the alkaloids in the frog's skin cause extreme pain and unpleasant taste. This will usually discourage a predator from attacking a cream-backed poison frog more than once. However, H. subpunctatus is still vulnerable to more determined predators, such as snakes, which is further evidence that it may be a fairly young species compared to other inedible or even deadly dendrobatids.  Description  The cream-backed poison frog is one of the smallest dendrobatids, reaching a length of 2 cm when fully grown. As stated above, it has poorly developed alkaloid poisons in its skin that make it unpalatable to predators, but it still mostly depends on its body camouflage for protection. Like many of the genus Hyloxalus, it has fairly drab coloration. Its main body is wood brown, with cream-colored stripes running down the length of its back (hence the frog's common name) and flanks that range from dark, smoky gray to inky black. H. subpunctatus may be one of the most primitive poison dart frogs, as it bears several similarities to hylids, such as long, narrow toes with suckerlike discs at the ends to help it grip leaves, slight webbing between its toes, and cryptic coloration. While hylids use the suckers on their toes to climb trees, the cream backed poison frog uses them to give it a good grip as it clambers through the leaf litter. Other dendrobatids lack webbing on their feet, and the discs at the tips of their toes are not adhesive. In addition, the cream-backed poison frog is one of the few species of dendrobatids that does not care for its young, another sign that it is a fairly primitive frog. Distribution and habitat The cream-backed poison frog is native to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense highland region of the Eastern Cordillera in Boyac√°, Cundinamarca and Meta Departments of central Colombia, at altitudes between above sea level. Its habitat is open areas, marshes, wetlands, forest edges, and 'p√°ramo. It does not tolerate waters polluted by urban or agricultural runoffs.

It belonged to Leo C. McNamara, Sr. and at one time was internationally known as the largest standardbred pacer breeding farm in the country.Bradley, John. \\"Modern Pacing Sire Lines\\". Russell Meerdink Company, 1998. The farm was the birthplace of numerous famous horses over the years. In the early 1950s there were over 500 horses being cared for on the farm. History In 1934, Leo C. McNamara, Sr., of Indianapolis, Indiana purchased a 100-acre farm northwest of Carmel, Indiana. The horse farm was initially acquired as a hobby, but was continually added to over the years and eventually consisted of 700 acres. The family permanently moved there in the summer of 1940. The name \\"Two Gaits Farm\\" refers to the trotter and pacer gaits of the Standardbred (harness horse). Mr. & Mrs. McNamara had one daughter and nine sons who grew up on the farm and helped raise the horses. They were also put to work maintaining stables, pastures and miles of freshly painted white fences. The family lived in the red brick farmhouse, built in 1861, which is still standing today. In August 1973, the McNamaras sold the entire remaining farm acreage to Mr. Ralph Wilfong. The family home was sold in the early 1990s. What remains of Two Gaits Farm was sold to Jeffrey and Beth Weisgerber in 2011. Horses still live on the property. Breeding Brood mares were sent from all over the United States and Canada to be bred with the Two Gaits stallions. The south part of the farm, which spread from what is now Bennett Road south to 136th Street, was reserved for outside owned horses exclusively. This was done as a health measure in order to control any disease that an incoming mare might carry. Every year, in late August, the McNamaras prepared about 50 weanlings, colts and fillies to sell at the Yearling Sales in Lexington, Kentucky and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Horsemen would come from around the country to examine and view these yearlings during the State Fair‚Äôs Grand Circuit Race meeting in Indianapolis. =Famous horses= *Hal Dale (1926‚Äì1955) :Born to Sire Abbedale & Dam Margaret Hal in 1926 in New Ross, Indiana. He was purchased from the McClintock's of Frankfort, Ind. He is known as the ‚Äúgrand daddy‚Äù of all the great pacers in the last 45 years. He started a new blood line of pacers,Busbey, Hamilton. \\"The Trotting and Pacing Horse in America\\". BiblioBazaar, 2008. who went on to become champions in their own right. He was the sire of Adios, Irish Hal, Kitty Hal, Dale Frost and Hal Senator. In the beginning his stud fee was $50 but as he produced offspring that won races, his stud fees topped $5,000. He died on October 16, 1955. He was inducted into the United States Trotting & Pacing Hall of Fame in Goshen, New York. *Adios (1940‚Äì1965) :Born at Two Gaits Farm, he was sold at auction in Lexington, KY in 1941. His price of $2000 for a yearling was a record at that time. At one time, he was owned by Mr. Harry Warner of Warner Bros. Pictures. Later, Hanover Shoe Farm in Pennsylvania purchased him for $500,000, another record price for a stallion. As a stud, he went on to surpass his father, Hal Dale, in producing the most offspring that raced a mile in two minutes or better. Village of Mt. Carmel In the mid-1950s, Mr. McNamara decided to develop a planned community that would provide a farm-type atmosphere in which to raise a family. A complete survey was made of the farm and a noted community development architect laid out a master plan for a new community that would be known as the Village of Mt. Carmel. He obtained water and sewer franchise from the state of Indiana systems for this community. They were the first privately owned facilities of that nature in Hamilton County. The private water system was still used for the VOMC until 2002. The reputation of Two Gaits Farm put Carmel on the map and helped home sales in the new community. In 1955, Mr. McNamara donated money and 11 acres of land to the Diocese of Lafayette in Indiana for the building of a church and school. The church, at the corner of 146th and Oakridge Road, was named Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and was completed in 1956. It has grown substantially and now serves over 13,000 families and includes the Matthew 25 Help Center and Trinity Clinic. Mr. McNamara died in 1959 but the development continued. He was the first to be buried at that church. When the farm was sold to Ralph Wilfong in 1973, he went on to develop Sections 6, 7 and 9 expanding the floor plans from the typical ranch style home common in sections 1-5, to include the Tri-Level and Two Floor plans that are very common in the rest of Mt. Carmel. Section 8, known as the ‚Äònew‚Äô section, began development in 1995. He took the farm property north of 146th Street and made a new subdivision. He named it The Village Farms, keeping with Mr. McNamara‚Äôs dream of a farm-type community. Mr. Wilfong was a developer by profession, and a lover of horses. He moved into the old brick home which had formerly been the Stud Manager's tenant home between Adios Pass and Village Drive North, on 146th street in 1973, and lived there until his death in the mid-1990s. In 2003, a few remaining acres became John Paul Way and section 10 was created. In the early 1940s, Mr. McNamara built a ¬Ω mile clay-training track between what is now Harmony Road and Adios Pass. This was removed for the housing development in the late 1970s and relocated just north of 146th Street until the mid-1990s, when The Village Farms portion of the original Two Gaits Farm was developed. =Notable street names= *Bennett Rd. was named after Bishop Bennett who was the first Bishop of the Diocese of Lafayette in Indiana. *Village Dr. was named to signify the ‚ÄòVillage‚Äô or tight knit community that Mr. McNamara envisioned for The Village of Mt. Carmel. In the original plans for the neighborhood, developers wanted the layout to resemble the shape of a rosary. The main north/south street and Bennett Road and Adios Pass semi-accomplished this. *Park View Rd. was named after the park surrounding the water tower that used to stand near the corner of Park View Road and Adios Pass. The park sat on 4 acres of land and was used as a central meeting place for the families and friends of village residents. The gatherings became annual traditions for some of the residents of Mt. Carmel. New homes have since been built in that area and a new park developed with a swimming pool and tennis courts. *Meadowview Ct. was named after Meadow Downs Race Track in Pennsylvania. *Hamp Ct. was named after a friend of Mr. McNamara‚Äôs. They were Directors of the United States Trotting Association (USTA) together where Mr. McNamara was also a founder. His full name was Max Hamp. *Colby Ct. was named after the pacer stallion, Colby Hanover who produced several champion pacers. *Haldale Dr. was named after Hal Dale, Two Gaits‚Äô first stud and premier stallion for the farm. *Adios Pass was named after Adios, one of the prize offspring of Two Gaits Farm. *Painter Ct. was named after the pacer stallion, Painter.

Along with Thurston Dart, Oliver Neighbour and Stanley Sadie he was one of Britain's leading musicologists of the post-World War II generation. He played an instrumental part in improving professional musicological standards in England through research initiatives, conferences and scholarly publications. This greatly increased his country's international reputation in the field of music scholarship. Fortune's speciality in musicological research was in 17th-century Italian music and on the lives and works of George Friederich Handel and Henry Purcell. He contributed articles to several encyclopaedias and was notably one of the senior editors of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. He also contributed writings or served as an editor to numerous music publications and books. For many years he was the co-editor of the journal Music & Letters. Life and career Born in Northumberland, Fortune was the son of an insurance salesman. An only child, he moved with his parents at the age of 10 to the Handsworth, West Midlands area of Birmingham. He lived in the same house there for his entire life; notably living next door to the mother of British Labour Party MP Clare Short. He served as Short's agent during most of her time as an MP and was also highly active in the education system in Birmingham; serving for many years as a chairman of school governors. After receiving his childhood education at the Handsworth Grammar School, Fortune attended the University of Birmingham from 1947 to 1950 where he earned degrees in music and the Italian language. He went on to earn a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1954; becoming the second person to be awarded a doctorate for music in the history of the United Kingdom. His doctoral thesis on the development of monody in Italy was overseen by Thurston Dart. With Dart he later edited John Dowland's Ayres for Four Voices (1953‚Äì63). One of his other important mentors at Cambridge was Professor Sir Anthony Lewis, then honorary secretary of the Purcell Society and a co-founder of the Musica Britannica. With Lewis he worked on The Works of Henry Purcell, \\"which played a significant role in establishing the position of the major English composer\\". From 1956 to 1959 Fortune served as music librarian at Senate House of the University of London. He left there to become a lecturer at the University of Birmingham in the fall of 1959. He remained there until his retirement in 1985; at which point he had been working there as a reader. From 1957 to 1971 he was the Royal Musical Association's secretary and later served as the organisation's vice-president; posts through which he encouraged many young music scholars. During the 1970s and 1980s he worked under Stanley Sadie as one of the senior editors and as a writer for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980, 1st edition). From 1980 to 2008 he served as co- editor of the journal Music & Letters. In the 1960s Fortune and musicologist Denis Arnold founded an important annual conference for graduate students in music in England which established for the first time in that country a community for music scholarship. With Arnold he also collaborated on The Monteverdi Companion (1968, enlarged and reissued as The New Monteverdi Companion, 1985) and The Beethoven Companion (1971). He collaborated on several other publications with a variety of scholars, mostly as an editor, including a collection of essays in honour of Winton Dean in 1987. He contributed several articles to Musica Britannica from 1975 to 1977 and to The New Oxford History of Music in 1985. While his scholarly work tended to focus on early music, he was a champion of the music of contemporary composer John Casken and for many years provided significant financial support to the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. He died in Birmingham at the age of 84 having never married or driven a car.

Early years Marcello Rodriguez Pons, architect and designer born in the city of C√≥rdoba, Argentina. Part of his professional work during the first years was of a conceptual nature, and gradually, as the years passed, his ideas materialised into concrete projects. Designer from everyday products such as chairs, tables, books and wine labels to hotels and masterplans of new cities (see his MASTERPLAN https://issuu.com/marcellorodriguezpons/docs/masterplan_book_previewbook). Son of a German mother and an Argentinian father, he did his elementary schooling at Academia Arguello, in his home town. He developed his first experiences in design at architectural firms while he studied architecture at the National University of C√≥rdoba In 1994, he formed a small architectural firm, and in 2000 he completed his master's degree in Architectural and Urban Design at the same university in Argentina. He moved to Malaga, Spain, where he worked at HCP Architecture & Engineering,http://www.arabianbusiness.com/creativity- counts-10881.html from 2002 and until 2011. In 2012 he opened his own architecture office Rodriguez Pons & Partnershttp://rodriguezpons.com/. His main activity as an architect is based on the development of Master Plans for communities all over the world, and the design buildings in a contemporary style, taking special care on spaces, envelopes and how light affects them. Sunlight is in his projects controlled by a series of layers that constitute, in many cases, the outer ‚ÄúWood & White‚Äù envelope system as he calls it, which includes balconies as sunshades, blinds, plus other natural and/or artificial elements on the fa√ßades, to achieve energy efficiency and sustainability.https://worldarchitecture.org/profiles/hgpfp/marcello- rodriguez-pons-profile-pages.html In the interior design of his projects, as well as in the products and furniture designs he also uses the ‚ÄúWood & White‚Äù design style, often with the addition of black, gray and/or bricks. Works and Projects Punta Jabali Winery in San Luis, Argentina One of his first relevant projects was the Punta Jabali Wineryhttps://worldarchitecture.org/architecture-projects/hheen/punta-jabali- winery-project-pages.html (designed in 2014) which presented the opportunity to look at the winery as a building type, using the topography of the site to aid the winemaking process, and to create the optimum natural working conditions, while reducing the building's energy demands and its impact on the landscape. The Winery is oriented on a north-south axis, using the site inclination to allow grapes to enter the building by gravity. Grape access is a key space in wine making; a covered external space was created in order for the grapes to be selected manually. The building's levels expresses the main stages of production: fermentation in steel vats; ageing in oak barrels; and maturation in bottles; at the highest level we designed an operations hub, from which all stages of the production process can be controlled. The upper volume of the building emerges from the land, wanting to be the business card of the winery. It is clearly expressing the values that prevail in the project. The building enjoys natural light through an oversized fully openable window, views into the vineyard and a direct connection to the Barrel Hall and Cellar underground. Lined with slats from recycled wine barrels, the public areas evoke the rich tradition of winemaking in the region. Olympic Sports Initiation Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The Olympic Sports Initiation Centerhttps://worldarchitecture.org/architecture-projects/hzevc/olympic- sports-initiation-center-project-pages.html (designed in 2015) is a low rise development located inside a bigger master plan at the called Cidade Esportiva da Baixada Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This 30 hectar master plan, also designed by Rodriguez Pons & Partners, includes, a sports center, residential units, school, retail, native forests, lagoons and the Brazilian Volunteer Firefighters Brigade. The sports buildings have a clean and tensioned silhouette with which the white horizontal lines of the grades and the curve of the grades-roof contrast with the vertical sun protection wooden blinds of the Indoor Arena, and the Aquatics Stadium. All of it clearly reflects his personal ‚ÄúWood & White‚Äù design style. Between all these buildings, a multipurpose open air plaza joins them with the parking areas and the rest of the sports fields \\"connected\\" by large overhangs, canopies, fountains and ramps. Millennium Casino & Resort in Fier, Albania Millennium Casino & Resorthttps://worldarchitecture.org/architecture-projects/nefh/acra- towers-project-pages.html (designed in 2011) and the Central District https://worldarchitecture.org/architecture-projects/mmgg/central-district- project-pages.html building in it, was designed in the city of Fier, Albania, a 500-hectare master plan which includes two of the highest multi-use towers in Europe which rise up to +400 m. These towers have an elliptical faceted exoskeleton design for the buildings layout providing both gravity and lateral resistance for the building. The structural exoskeleton diagrid system creates an open, column-free environment. With spans between diagrid nodes of over fifteen meters, views to the three golf courses and the 500 yachts marina from the interior are expansive. In order to maintain purely axial loads in the elliptical form, diagrid members are constructed from straight, rather than curving segments which make them more cost effective among other sustainable design solutions. Previously as project director at HCP Architecture and Engineering he designed the People Square Towers in the city of Hefei, China, a multifunctional complex that features a surrounding structure in the form of \\"scales\\" that fulfil the double function of supporting the structure and acting as a filter for the sunlight, making it a project with one of the highest levels of sustainability. On the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, Amwaj Park District is a project with a \\"skin\\" featuring horizontal aluminium strips that provide dynamism and unity to the whole complex, which is located on an artificial manmade island. Among his Master Plan projects, Alcaidesa Universidad del Golf in Spain and Dannat Resort in Khobar, Saudi Arabia stand out on account of their gentle shapes that merge firmly and harmoniously into their respective environments, in them, he did his first studies of what he later called his ‚ÄúWood & White‚Äù personal image design style.

Buy Quiet Programs are examples of noise control strategies. Buy Quiet is part of the larger Hearing Loss Prevention Program, and is an example of Prevention Through Design, which seeks to reduce occupational injury through prevention considerations in designs that impact workers. Organizations that have embarked upon the buy- quiet initiative are moving towards the creation of an environment and workplace where there will be no harmful noise. Many companies are automating equipment or setting up procedures that can be operated by workers from a quiet control room free from harmful noise, chemical agents, and heat. Some of such companies that been recognized for their demonstrated results from noise control and Buy Quiet initiatives, with a Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award The objectives of this award are to recognize effective and innovative initiatives, and to share that information to a broader community.  Health effects from noise  Noise-induced hearing loss is an irreversible condition that is 100% preventable, and over 30 million US workers are exposed to hazardous noise on the job, which makes them susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Noise-induced hearing loss is also the most common occupational illness in the United States. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that workers be exposed to no more than 85 dB per eight hours per day. The EPA Buy Quiet Program (1970s-80s) A formal Buy Quiet program of the late 1970s and early 1980s was a cooperative effort of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP), and the National League of Cities (NLC). This program represented a marked departure from the regulatory approach that the U.S. Government still uses to compel the manufacture and sales of products that are less harmful to human health. Instead of regulations, the EPA/NIGP/NLC initiative used the power of high volume procurements by governments at all levels to stimulate a market demand for quiet products. This market-based, incentive-driven approach enabled federal, state, and local governments to purchase quieter products and equipment at competitive prices, by awarding procurements to the lowest \\"effective bid price‚Äù. The effective bid price adjusted the monetary bid price by the sound level of the bidder's equipment in comparison to the average level of all bidders' proposals. Products purchased under this program included construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, trash trucks/compactors, chain saws, and similar noise generating equipment. The program was part of an initiative to help localities create \\"quiet communities\\". States and localities that participated were encouraged also to promote similar Buy Quiet procurements by private sector organizations in their jurisdictions as a way of \\"spreading\\" the market. The NIGP/NIGP/NLC Buy Quiet program extended the concepts of \\"social marketing\\" to include the creation of markets for socially and environmentally responsible products. It did this by combining incentivized procurements with the development of a national database of buy quiet purchases available to all interested parties. This database demonstrated that incentivized procurements could achieve quiet products at competitive prices. The lowest \\"bid price\\" was most often the lowest \\"effective bid price\\" and quiet products were indicative of high quality and high performing products. The incentive mechanism was also used to purchase low maintenance and low energy products, and is adaptable to other sustainable product initiatives. The Buy Quiet program ended with the dissolution of the Office of Noise Abatement and Control in EPA during the Reagan Administration. Contemporary Buy Quiet programs = NYC = In July 2007, New York City‚Äôs Department of Environmental Protection promulgated rules concerning citywide construction noise mitigation. These new rules reward contractors deploying tools and machinery that use the best available noise control technologies, are designed for quiet, or are known to be the quietest available models of their type. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection released a products and vendor guidance sheet in order to assist contractors for achieving compliance with the New York City Noise Regulations. = NASA = In 2006, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) codified a Buy Quiet program. In 2009 NASA implemented an online tool called the NASA Buy-Quiet Roadmap. = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health = A video describing the Buy Quiet program in the context of construction A video describing the Buy Quiet program in the context of manufacturing National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers developed a Buy Quiet prevention initiative intended to facilitate the implementation of Buy Quiet programs for the construction and manufacturing sectors. As a part of this, NIOSH created a searchable database describing noise emission levels of powered hand tools. The database is called the NIOSH Power Tools Database. In 2014, NIOSH officially launched a Buy Quiet website and blog to promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment. The initiative also aims to encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment. The intention of Buy Quiet programs is to reduce the risk of hearing loss at the worksite. Buy Quiet programs seek to minimize the impact of noise on communities and help companies comply with OSHA and other noise regulation requirements as well. Additionally, Buy Quiet concepts may reduce the long- term costs of audiometric testing, personal protective equipment, and workers‚Äô compensation. NIOSH suggests Buy Quiet programs contain the following elements: # An inventory of existing machinery and tools with corresponding noise levels. The company‚Äôs purchaser can use the inventory to compare noise levels of equipment before buying or renting. The inventory can also be used for assisting, tracking, and promoting a company‚Äôs Buy Quiet purchases. # A Buy Quiet company policy or procedure. Policy can be an easy and effective way for employers to show commitment to protecting the hearing and well-being of their employees by using the best equipment available. # Educational materials and promotional tools. These resources should be designed to help inform employees, management, customers, and the community about the importance and benefits of Buy Quiet. NIOSH has developed a series of posters for public use. # Cost-Benefit Analysis of Buy Quiet programs. The quieter piece of equipment may be the least expensive when all life cycle costs of the machinery, possible workers‚Äô compensation claims, costs associated with a company‚Äôs hearing conservation program, costs of healthcare (such as hearing aids), and lost productivity are counted. NIOSH estimates a savings of $100 per decibel reduced when purchasing a quieter machine. = Laborers' Health and Safety Fund = The Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America indicates buying quieter equipment as a cost-effective way to reduce noise at a construction worksite in its Best Practices Guide on Controlling Noise on Construction Sites.

It is owned by media company Penton. History The newspaper's lineage can be traced back to the 1850s and two separate publications, the Northwestern Farmer and Horticultural Journal and the Iowa Farmer and Horticulturist, which merged in 1861 to become The Iowa Homestead and Northwestern Farmer; the name eventually shortened to The Iowa Homestead. Henry Wallace became editor of The Iowa Homestead in 1883, and James M. Pierce purchased the paper in 1885. Conflicts between the two over the paper's philosophy caused Wallace to leave. Wallace's sons had been publishing The Farm and Dairy since 1893, and he joined in its operation; the Wallace name was added in 1895, and the publication's name was shorted to Wallaces' Farmer in 1898. The Iowa Homestead and Wallaces' Farmer were bitter rivals, and Wallace family ultimately bought out The Iowa Homestead in 1929. Henry's son, Henry Cantwell Wallace, and his son, Henry A. Wallace‚Äîlater a Cabinet secretary and vice president under Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äîserved as editors. The first issue of the combined Wallaces Farmer and Iowa Homestead came out in October 1929, as the stock market began to crash. The publication faltered, and in 1932 Dante Pierce, son of James M. Pierce, came back as receiver; he purchased the publication at a sheriff's sale in 1935. After Dante Pierce's death in 1955, the publication was sold to the publishers of Prairie Farmer, and the name was shortened to Wallaces Farmer.

The author, co- author, editor and/or translator of more than sixty books, including four landmark annotated translations of novels by Jules Verne, Miller taught at Hofstra University, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Colorado State University, and for over 40 years at New York University, where he created and taught a popular \\"Great Books\\" course. In 1980, he received the NYU Alumni Great Teacher Award. For fifteen years in the 1960s and 1970s, his Peabody Award-winning show Reader's Almanac was a fixture on WNYC, public radio in New York City, and broadcast interviews with many established and rising authors and poets, including Nadine Gordimer, Andrew Glaze, Allen Ginsberg, James Kirkwood Jr., William Packard, Sidney Offit, Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut Jr and Steven Kunes. (A compilation of Miller's several interviews with Vonnegut was published by Caedmon Audio in 2006.) The author of two published collections of poetry (Making an Angel, 1977, Love's Mainland, 2001), Miller's verse drama Joseph in the Pit was produced off- Broadway in 1993 and 2002. A pioneering figure of modern Jules Verne studies, Miller's 1965 Washington Square Press edition of Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea included both the first unabridged English translation of the novel and the first scholarly discussion of what he termed the problem of \\"the two Jules Vernes.\\" European readers, Miller observed, Miller's analysis of the abridgment and mistranslation of Verne, and his call for accurate and complete English renderings, initiated a major reassessment by English-speaking critics of Verne's importance, and is credited with fostering the publication of numerous new English editions of Verne and the emergence of Verne studies as a serious academic discipline in the US and UK. Miller's scholarly editions of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1976), From the Earth to the Moon (1978), and (with Frederick Paul Walter) The Meteor Hunt (2006) were the first annotated editions of those novels in any language. His preface to the first English translation of Verne's The Mighty Orinoco (2002) has been described as the best critical commentary on this novel in French or English. A founding member of the North American Jules Verne Society and of the Editorial Board of Verniana ‚Äì Jules Verne Studies / Etudes Jules Verne , and an active contributor to the online discussion group Jules Verne Forum , in his later years Miller was a valued mentor to Verne scholars in the US, UK, Europe, and Asia. Miller died before learning that the North American Jules Verne Society had decided to dedicate the fourth volume in its Palik Series of first-time Verne translations to him; the book dedicated to Miller, The Count of Chanteleine: A Tale of the French Revolution.

It runs in a general east‚Äìwest direction from the main entrance of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola to a junction with U.S. Highway 61 (US 61) north of St. Francisville. LA 66 winds through the scenic Tunica Hills of West Feliciana Parish and connects the prison facility with US 61, the main highway through the area. It is also steeped in history as the route is derived from an ancient Native American portage known as the Tunica Trace. The surrounding area contains burial mounds and other artifacts recalling this heritage. More recent historical sites include the antebellum Trudeau plantation located on the former site of a Tunica Indian village. Several small rural communities are also located along LA 66, including Tunica, Retreat, and Weyanoke. LA 66 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, replacing former State Route 124. The route is also designated as the Tunica Trace Byway in the state's system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. Route description From the west, LA 66 begins at the main entrance to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, formerly the site of a 19th century plantation now within the boundaries of the prison. The maximum security facility is located within a bend of Mississippi River in the northwestern corner of West Feliciana Parish near the Mississippi state line. LA 66 heads southeast through a thickly wooded rural area and passes through the tiny community of Tunica. The highway then curves to the northeast, passing between the north and south tracts of the Tunica Hills Wildlife Management Area. After reaching a point about from the state line in an area known as Retreat, LA 66 curves back to the southeast and intersects LA 969, which connects to Pinckneyville, Mississippi. LA 66 maintains this general trajectory for the remainder of its route. Over the next , the highway passes through the sparsely populated areas of Turnbull and Weyanoke before intersecting LA 968\\\\. This minor route leads to a point on the bank of the Mississippi River called Brandon. LA 66 continues for another , roughly following the east side of the serpentine Little Bayou Sara. It then bends eastward to cross the main branch of Bayou Sara, also known as Big Bayou Sara, by way of a pony truss bridge dating to the 1940s. LA 66 proceeds a short distance further to a junction with US 61 in the community of Bains. US 61 connects with Baton Rouge, the state capital, via St. Francisville to the south and Natchez, Mississippi to the north. =Route classification and data= LA 66 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The route is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 averaged 1,960 vehicles near the state penitentiary entrance, increasing to a peak 4,200 vehicles near the junction with US 61. The posted speed limit is . The entire route of LA 66 is known as the Tunica Trace Byway in the state- designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, LA 66 was designated as State Route 124. It was an addition to the system that was designated in 1926 by an act of the state legislature. The Angola State Farm, now Louisiana State Penitentiary, began operations in the early 1900s. Its location was formerly the site of several 19th Century plantations on the east bank of the Mississippi River in West Feliciana Parish. The addition of Route 124 created a state-maintained access road from the prison to the main highway through the area, State Route 3, which became part of US 61 later the same year. Route 124 followed the existing Tunica Trace, an old Native American pathway that wound through the area's hilly terrain. A straighter path connecting more directly with the important town of St. Francisville was plotted and added to the state highway system in 1928 as State Route 325. However, it was never fully improved as a through route. Route 124 was an unimproved dirt road when originally designated in 1926. The entire route was gravel surfaced by 1929 and then paved a decade later, in 1939. For most of its existence, Route 124 continued further into the prison grounds than the present LA 66. This extension paralleled the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway line which once traversed the property and crossed the Mississippi River by ferry into Pointe Coupee Parish. The route was truncated to its present terminus around 1953, shortly before the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 66 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of former Route 124. Since then, the route has remained unchanged apart from reconstruction projects over the years which have straightened some of its sharper curves by cutting into the terrain. This is especially evident in Tunica, where a bypassed curve still exists as Crescent Road, and in the area immediately west of LA 969\\\\. The junction with US 61 has also been moved to the north with Parish Road 265 now following the original alignment there. In 1988, the entire route of LA 66 was designated by the state legislature as the Tunica Trace Scenic Byway within the Louisiana Scenic Byways program. It was officially opened as a scenic route in October of that year with a dedication ceremony that included a representative of the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe. The government of West Feliciana Parish also changed the highway's local name from the generic \\"Angola Road\\" to \\"Tunica Trace\\" to highlight the route's history.

Presented by John Sweeney, it is a follow-up of his 2007 investigation into the Church of Scientology and features interviews with former high-ranking members of the organisation. Production Reporter John Sweeney presented the hour-long programme, which was a follow-up to his 2007 documentary Scientology and Me in which he travelled to Los Angeles to investigate Scientology. Contents In The Secrets of Scientology, Sweeney interviews several individuals connected with the organisation and investigates allegations by former Scientology followers that the church sought to divide their families, something the church denies. Among those interviewed include Mike Rinder a former long-term member of the organisation and one of its officials who was assigned to \\"handle\\" Sweeney during his 2007 programme. Rinder, who left the Church soon after the previous documentary, confirms Sweeney's suspicions that he was followed by the organisation during the making of that programme. He tells the reporter; \\"You were being followed [...] It would have come under my purview, no doubt whatsoever.\\" Rinder, a member of the church since the age of six, talks about how he was subjected to \\"disconnection\\", a process by which his family cut him out of their lives. Another Church of Scientology official interviewed during the programme is Amy Scobee, who joined the Church at the age of 14 and was a member of its Sea Org which runs the organisation's day- to-day operations. Scobee tells Sweeney of how details of her sex life before she was married were leaked to a newspaper after she left Scientology in 2005 and criticised the Church. As with the 2007 documentary, Sweeney and his team were once again followed by people filming them during their visit to the United States, although on this occasion, their filming was much less covert. However, those filming refused to answer Sweeney's questions when he approached them and asked about their identity and purpose. On his return to the United Kingdom the BBC received photographs of Sweeney in a farewell embrace with Amy Scobee from Carter-Ruck, the Church's UK lawyers, something which Sweeney welcomed as proof that those following him were working on behalf of the Church. Ratings The Secrets of Scientology was a ratings success for Panorama and the BBC in its initial broadcast; with MediaTel Newsline reporting, \\"The Panorama special, which saw reporter John Sweeney get an insider's view of the organisation, attracted more than five million peak viewers and a 20.3% average audience share during the all-important 9pm to 10pm slot.\\" The documentary performed better than simultaneous programming for 71 Degrees North. It was the most popular programme broadcast in the 9pm hour. Anti-documentary activity by Scientology As with John Sweeney's previous documentary, the Church Of Scientology continued to enforce its 'fair game' policy of harassing and documenting anyone who may be critical of the organisation, although much less covertly than in Scientology And Me. Shortly after The Secrets Of Scientology premiered, the Church created their own documentary regarding Sweeney and Mike Rinder's activities called 'Panorama: Desperate Lies', not only listing off further alleged violations of BBC and Ofcom Broadcast Codes in both of Sweeney's programs, but also making numerous allegations about Church detractors featured in the documentary. Reception In a review of The Secrets of Scientology, Metro commented, \\"Thankfully, there was exemplary investigative journalism on show, with the BBC man unbowed by closed avenues of inquiry or alleged surveillance.\\" JOE.ie highlighted the documentary as its \\"Pick of the night\\" in television. The Independent selected the film as its recommendation for \\"Pick of the day\\"; it was also recommended by The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, Bristol Evening Post, and Wales on Sunday. David Chater of The Times called Mike Rinder a \\"whistleblower\\", commenting, \\"Mike Rinder, erstwhile spokesman for the Church of Scientology and the former head of its Office of Special Affairs, has turned whistleblower and describes the operation against Sweeney last time round.\\" Fiona Mayhem of Watch With Mothers assessed the documentary as, \\"a bit of a disappointing effort which could have been made more entertaining ... or more informative, by exploring more what it is about the tenets of the cult that former members still hold so dear. Still, for those with no prior knowledge of the religion, this was a decent starter pack.\\" Paddy Sherman of the Liverpool Echo called the documentary an \\"in-depth look at the workings of the church\\". The Guardian referred to it as \\"a very disturbing video documentary [made] for the BBC programme Panorama\\". In an analysis of the documentary for Catholic Online, associate editor Randy Sly noted the programme's ratings success in the UK, and commented, \\"People in England seemingly can't get enough when it comes to revelations about Scientology.\\" References External links *The Secrets of Scientology at BBC Online 2010 television specials BBC television documentaries Scientology-related controversies Works critical of Scientology ","title":"The Secrets of Scientology"},{"id":"28984770","text":"Metal Queen ‚Äì B-Sides & Rarities is a double CD compilation album released in 2007 under the label No Remorse Records, containing songs of the German hard rock singer Doro Pesch.

Early & Family Life  Known in Upstate New York as \\"The Judge,\\" Kinney was born in Ogden Township, Monroe County, New York State on June 20, 1860. His parents were William Deegan Kinney (1833‚Äì1888) and Julia Hough Kinney, of Adams Basin and later of Spencerport, New York. William D. Kinney was a Democratic activist, clerk of the town of Ogden, and weighmaster on the Erie Canal at Rochester from 1878-1879.Fitch at 302. The elder Kinney emigrated from Nappanee, Ontario in 1855, having settled at Erinville, Ontario during the Great Famine. The family was native to Coolkenno on the Wicklow-Carlow county border, Leinster Province, in the years when Ireland was still a colony of the United Kingdom. Maternally, Judge Kinney's family were from Ballina, Co. Tipperary. They settled at Herkimer, New York during the same period. Both families anglicized their names from \\"Kenny\\" to \\"Kinney\\" and \\"Hough\\" to \\"Howe\\" in order to mitigate discrimination and assimilate within the American Protestant majority. Kinney's great uncle, John Howe of Boston, mustered and fought with the 28th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865); his cousin James Howe of Herkimer mustered with the 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He was also a first cousin to the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, president of Notre Dame University, and his brother, the Rev. Frank Cavanaugh. His granddaughter, Mrs. Captain Donald J. Meyer, USN, was sister-in-law to Mrs. George A. Meyer, niece to the Rev. Edward B. Bunn, S.J., president and chancellor of Georgetown University. John F. Kinney himself was educated at the public Union School of Spencerport, New York and took the collegiate course at Saint Joseph's College, Buffalo, New York (later Niagara University). He read the law with William H. Bowman and then matriculated at the Albany Law School, boarding with the Edward and Mary (Foohy) Hanlon family on Eagle Street, Albany, next to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. His brother-in-law was the Reverend John J. Hanlon. Graduating from law school in 1881, Judge Kinney returning to Rochester and was admitted to the bar. He practiced law. In 1883, he married Elizabeth \\"Libbie\\" J. Hanlon, daughter of his landlady during his studies at Albany Law School. The Hanlons were native to County Armagh. The Kinney family would eventually include eldest son, William Edward Kinney, an engineer and Rochester public works contractor; Helen Regina Kinney, a health care worker; John Joseph Kinney (spouse first to Marie Elizabeth Tobin and after her death, Kathryn J. Fitzsimmons), an engineer with the City of Rochester, and Dora Ellen Kinney, an instructor.  Professional and political career  His early practice included serving as a Referee in Bankruptcy.Legal Notices, Rochester Democrat & Chronicle (Jan. 24, 1888) at 8. Upon the resignation of Special County Judge William E. Werner, Governor David B. Hill appointed John F. Kinney to the Monroe County bench in 1890. In 1892, Judge Kinney served as one of the founders of the Bar Association, City of Rochester. The Democratic Party's caucus nominated him for the same position in the next election, a ballot season which ended in the defeat of all Democrats on the ticket but for Judge Kinney.A History of the City of Rochester (Rochester and Post Express, 1895) at 211; see also William Farley Peck, History of Rochester and Monroe County (1908) at 364. Kinney was accordingly the first Democrat elected to county-wide office in eight years (1882‚Äì1890). During the 1893 electoral season, Judge Kinney served as delegate for the New York State Democratic Party's Monroe County, Second Assembly District, representing county interests at the party convention held at Saratoga Springs.Lively County Conventions, N.Y. Times (Oct. 2, 1893). Two years later, the Democratic Party in Monroe County had dissolved into feuding factions, necessitating intervention by State officials.Monroe County Factions; Meeting of Democratic Committee to Harmonize Them, N.Y. Times (July 19, 1895). Judge Kinney led one of the four factions, called the Page County Committee. It advanced the candidacies of three local politicians (Tracy, Kelly and Houck). Other factions were represented by the Cleveland Legion, the Flower City Democracy movement, and the Smith County Committee. On the State committee mediating the party fight was Cord Meyer of Queens County, New York, whose grandson was Cord Meyer, Jr..The Judge's great grandson, Dan Meyer, is not of the Queens County family, but rather of the Clifford Avenue Meyer family, in Rochester's old German north neighborhood. In 1904, Kinney served as Chairman, Central Committee of the Democratic Party, Monroe County.Fitch at 302. One of his chief antagonists in Rochester politics and in the practice of law was Thomas Raines. In private practice, Judge Kinney took on cases contentious in nature. Though a personal friend and business partner with Rochester's Mayor George Washington Aldridge, Kinney was also the attorney to which plaintiffs not well-connected would bring their cases. These often dealt with corruptly managed public contracts, such as the one Judge Kinney took to the United States Supreme Court via Moffett, Hodgkins & Clarke Co. v. City of Rochester.See 178 U.S. 373 (1900). His later cases also reflect a free market preference and a disdain for Progressive-era regulation, including reasonable restrictions against business in the interest of public health.People ex. Rel. Schulz v. Hamilton, 161 N.Y. Supp. 425 (Nov. 6, 1916) at 426. Kinney also represented milk and oleomargarine producers facing State prosecution over food quality-related transgressions.Documents of the Assembly of the State of New York, Second Annual Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture (1895) at 401. Judge Kinney stepped down from the bench after he was appointed Corporation Counsel for the City of Rochester in 1898. He served as head of the City's legal department through 1903. Many of his cases focused on Rochester's growth, and the need for infrastructure to support its industrializing population.See e.g. Conway v. City of Rochester, 157 N.Y. 33 (1898) and Schneider v. City of Rochester, 160 N.Y. 165 (1899). As Corporation Counsel, he hired attorney and future Corporation Counsel Benjamin B. Cunningham. Cunningham would go on to be opposing counsel against the Judge in the renowned \\"Damaged Goods\\" case. In April 1901, the Judge joined with other Rochester businessmen ‚Äì including Mayor George Washington Aldridge ‚Äì in founding the Genesee & Orleans Railway Company headquartered at Albion, New York. The electric railway was designed to support the burgeoning tourist industry at Point Breeze, Lake Ontario with a twenty-seven (27) mile track from Batavia, New York northward to the lake.Railway Age (April 15, 1901) at 413.  Member  Kinney was a founding member of the Knights of Columbus and a long-standing member of the Society of the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick. He also served as treasurer on the Grand Council of New York State, Catholic Mutual Benefit Association.Rochester Directory (Drew, Allis & Co. 1891) at 767.

It was established in 2006, becoming Western Australia's 97th national park in the process. It is around in area. Location The area is backed by King George Sound to the south, Oyster Harbour to the west, Taylor Inlet to the east and farmland to the north. The park takes its name from a small island off Ledge Beach, which is not part of the park. Boiler Bay is at the eastern edge of Ledge Beach. The Mount Martin Botanical Reserve is adjacent to the western boundary and Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve is approximately to the east of the park. Description The area is an almost unspoilt example of coastal east Kalgan vegetation system. Composed of granite headlands separated by sandy beaches with lakes and interdunal wetlands, the area contains a number of specific ecosystems. Rocky granite areas exist, including Mount Taylor and Mount Martin, both of which are part of the Gardner Landform unit. The diverse landforms and soils support an array of different habitats and a large number of floral species. A complex patchwork of forest, woodlands, wetlands, sedges, granite shrublands and coastal heath is found within the park. Flora and fauna Endangered species such as the noisy scrub-bird, western bristlebird and the western whipbird are known to inhabit the area. The endangered Western ringtail possum is also frequently sighted in the area. Many rare plant species including Corybas limpidus, Adenanthos cunninghamii, Banksia verticillata and Stylidium plantagineum are also found in the National Park. Areas of banksia woodland, sheoak forest, open heath and grassed dunes can all be found within the park. Notable flora include Banksia coccinea, Hakea elliptica, Allocasuarina trichodon, Agonis marginata and Dryandra formosa. The area is home to the most significant remaining stands of scarlet banksia, Banksia coccinea, in the region, however this community is threatened by Phytophthora dieback. Melaleuca striata coastal heath grows on the lower elevations of Mount Taylor. Melaleuca striata, Banksia attenuata and Banksia coccinea are present on the heath, but their growth is stunted by the salt laden air. Anarthria scabra is predominant in the sedgeland, with Adenanthos cuneatus, Astroloma baxteri, Hypocalymma strictum, Hypolaena exsulca, Isopogon cuneatus, Lyginia barbata, Melaleuca thymoides, and Petrophile rigida also present. The rare and ancient Main's assassin spider, currently listed as threatened, was found to inhabit the park during a survey conducted in 2008.

The brand is produced by the Product Care division of Sealed Air. Both the Bubble Wrap brand and product were introduced in 1960, with the launch of Sealed Air. Although the brand was originally used for the packaging of IBM computers, Sealed Air now does most of its Bubble Wrap business in the food packaging industry.  History  Bubble wrap was invented in 1957 by engineers Alfred Fielding and Marc Chavannes in Hawthorne, New Jersey. Fielding and Chavannes sealed two shower curtains together, creating a smattering of air bubbles, which they originally tried to sell as wallpaper. When the product turned out to be unsuccessful as wallpaper, the team marketed it as greenhouse insulation. Although Bubble Wrap was branded by Sealed Air Corporation (founded by Fielding and Chavannes) in 1960, it was not until a year later that its use in protective usage was discovered. As a packaging material, Bubble Wrap's first client was IBM, which used the product to protect the IBM 1401 computer during shipment. Fielding and Chavannes were inducted into the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame in 1993. Sealed Air celebrated Bubble Wrap's 50th birthday in January 2010.  Uses  The Annual Bubble Wrap Competition For Young Inventors was hosted by Sealed Air from 2006 to 2008, in which children were encouraged to design products made out of bubble wrap that had uses outside of the packaging industry. Inventions included a \\"Bubble Wrap Car Door Cover\\", a \\"Bubble Wrap Cushy Wheelchair\\", and \\"Transformable Bubble Wrap Kite\\".

However, contemporary comparative trials found that hypotension (low blood pressure) was a substantial concern when the drug was given at normal dosages for this indication; blood pressure reductions of up to 70 mmHg were reported. Reductions in dosage mitigated hypotension while maintaining antiemetic efficacy.

The film is directed by Paul Brown, and was written by Brown and Douglass. The film debuted at the ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood on September 9, 2010. The title is taken from words spoken by Portia in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven The film was re-released in 2018 under the title The Amendment. Plot Following missionary work on the Amazon River in Brazil, Dr. Richard Douglass moved his family to the Oklahoma City area, becoming a well-respected Baptist minister to the large congregation of Putnam City Baptist Church. His wife Marilyn was an accomplished singer and loving mother. The couple had two children, Brooks (16) and Leslie (12). On October 15, 1979, two drifters, Glen Ake and Steven Hatch entered their home, tied the parents and Brooks, took 12-year-old Leslie into the bedroom where both men raped her. After tying up Leslie, they shot all four family members, killing the parents and leaving the two siblings for dead. The movie is a story of forgiveness as primarily viewed from the perspective of Brooks. Both Brooks and Leslie have endured through the horror of the crime, then dealing through the emotional consequences to eventually excel in their respective careers, he as a state legislator, businessman, producer and actor; she as a professional educator.

History Although UAMS Medical Center (also known as University of Arkansas Medical Center) was founded in 1879, no patients were admitted or treated at the facility until 1892. What started as a free clinic later evolved into an entity known only as City Hospital when UAMS moved their campus just outside downtown Little Rock in 1935. That facility is now home to the William H. Bowen School of Law. UAMS and the City Hospital remained at that location until 1956, when they moved to the current location on West Markham Street in the central part of Little Rock. That 40 acre site was deeded to the university by the Arkansas State Hospital, and the name UAMS Medical Center originated with the new campus location. The campus saw extensive growth in the early 1960s to the late 1990s. UAMS began another large campus expansion in phases from 2001 to 2011, making it the state's largest academic health center.

These cards are issued by a state or country in which medical cannabis is recognized. Typically a patient is required to pay a fee to the state in order to obtain a medical marijuana card.. Sometimes it is alternatively referred to as medical marijuana identification (MMID), or medical marijuana (MMJ). In most states with medical marijuana card programs, the card is valid for up to 12 months and may be renewed. It usually needs another evaluation by the doctor and required to pay card fee again which costs less than initial registration.

Early life Henri was one of five children of Pierre Cleutin, or Clutin, mayor of Paris, and grandson of Henri, both were Councillors to the French Parliament. Labourier, the editor of Castelnau's memoirs, surmises the family had its origins in a cloth merchant who supplied Charles VI of France. Pierre Cleutin acquired the lands of Villeparisis and built a castle, and Henri was made its lord in 1552. Henri may have been destined for the church but was involved in a murder in Paris in 1535 and fled the country. He had a pardon in 1538. On the basis of this incident the historian Marie-No√´lle Baudouin-Matuszek revised his birth date to 1515.Le Labourier, Jean, ed., Les memoires de Messire Michel de Castelnau, vol.1, (Brussels, 1731), 430: Marie-No√´lle Baudouin-Matuszek, 'Un ambassadeur en Ecosse au XVI e si√®cle : Henri Clutin d'Oisel', in Revue Historique, vol. 281, no. 1 (569) (January‚ÄìMarch 1989), 80-3, 102. Rough Wooing Henri Cleutin, who was usually known as Monsieur d'Oysel, or d'Oisel, became ambassador resident in Scotland from 1546 during the war of the Rough Wooing, and, after Paul de Thermes left Scotland, was Henry II of France's Lieutenant-General in Scotland. Cleutin was very much a follower of the House of Guise who were gaining political powers in France.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooing (East Linton, 2000), p. 219. Scotland was ruled by Regent Arran, who became the Duke of Ch√¢telherault in 1548, but considerable power and a portion of the crown income was in the hands of Mary of Guise, the widow of James V of Scotland. When Cleutin arrived in Scotland there was an interlude of peace with England resulting from the Treaty of Ardres. However peace between Scotland and the Holy Roman Empire was not completely concluded. The Imperial ambassador in London Fran√ßois van der Delft became aware of Henri Cleutin, who he called \\"Oysif,\\" in Scotland in December 1546. The English Privy Council joked about his concerns and said that Cleutin carried letters of Bellerophon, the figure of classical myth set the impossible task of killing the chimaera after murdering his brother.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.8 (1904), 528. It was said that in 1546, during the Siege of St Andrews Castle, Cleutin had counselled Regent Arran that those in the castle should be promised what they asked for, and beheaded when they came out. Arran refused such treachery, and Cleutin was said to have joked with Guise, that this was good natured but not like the actions of any prince he knew.Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth, 1559-1560 (London, 1865), p. 11. The war with England soon recommenced, and after Scotland's defeat at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in September 1547, d'Oisel and Mary of Guise rode to Stirling Castle, and according to John Knox, Cleutin was as scared as a fox being smoked in his hole.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, Book 2, e.g., Lennox, Cuthbert ed., (1905), 103. On 7 July 1548, when Andr√© de Montalembert Sieur d'Esse spoke at the parliament at Haddington, proposing the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the Dauphin, d'Oysel as French ambassador accepted the unanimous approval.Thomson, Thomas, ed., Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 2, (1814), 481. D'Oysel then went to France, returning after a long discussion with Mary of Guise's brother, Francis, Le Balafr√©, Duc de Aumale, on 23 January 1548 at Savigny-le-Temple.Marguerite Wood ed., Balcarres Papers, vol.1 (SHS, Edinburgh, 1923), pp. 179-180. When Ferniehirst Castle was recovered from the English in February 1549, d'Oysel was one of the first at the walls and then he settled a heated debate over the army's next step. Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, advocated making a fortification at Roxburgh before the army moved on, and after the commanders held an inconclusive vote, d'Oysel appealed to the authority of Arran who finally agreed with Villegaignon.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), 288: Patrick Abercromby, The History of the Campagnes in Scotland, 1548 and 1549, (1707), pp. 96-97, (shows the fort was Roxburgh). The peace John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland criticised d'Oysel's role as ambassador for Scotland Cleutin remained in Scotland after the war with England was concluded in 1550. In May he travelled to the border to meet the brother of Mary of Guise, the Marquis de Mayenne, who had been a hostage for the peace in England. While waiting for the Marquis he visited Dunbar Castle, Fast Castle and Tantallon Castle. D'Oisel wrote to Mary of Guise from Dunglass remarking that there was nothing there except what they brought themselves. The countryside could hardly provide for their horses.A. Cameron ed., Balcarres Papers 1548-1557, (SHS, Edinburgh, 1925), pp. x, 63-65 D'Oisel, not the Duke of Ch√¢telherault, was left in charge of Scotland when Mary of Guise the Queen Dowager visited France in 1550.Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise (East Linton, 2002), 127-9. He wrote to Mary of Guise asking her to ensure that no impediment was made for food to be shipped to Scotland from France in February 1551 on account of the needs of the town of Edinburgh and the French soldiers because of the pillages and burnings during the war. D'Oisel and Regent Arran travelled to Jedburgh with Camillo Marini, an Italian military engineer to plan new fortifications on the border.A. Cameron ed., Balcarres Papers 1548-1557, (SHS, Edinburgh, 1925), 86-7, 92-3. At this height of the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland the Emperor's envoy to Edinburgh, Mathieu Strick, reported that d'Oisel wielded almost sovereign authority in matters of state and justice.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 10 (1914), 339. Unlike other French administrators employed by the Scottish court, such as Yves de Rubarye, contemporary sources point to his popularity amongst the Scottish nobility. Even an English observer, Sir Thomas Wharton observed of Guise and d'Oisel, 'all in Scotland obey and lyketh them.'Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, (2002), 128 & 128 n.23. Later Scottish Protestant chronicle writers George Buchanan and Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie agree on his ability and singular good judgment. Buchanan describes him as, \\"hasty and passionate, otherwise a good man, skilled in the arts both of peace and war.\\"Lindsay, Robert, History of Scotland, vol. 2 Edinburgh (1814), 513: Buchanan, George, History of Scotland, trans. Aikman (1827), 382, bk. 16 cap. 1. James Maitland of Lauderdale, a writer of a later generation, mentions some imperfections of his nature, such as, his \\"sudden and vehement choler.\\" Cleutin, Yves de Rubarye, and Bartholomew de Villemore, the Regent's financial controller were criticised for their lack of understanding of the Scots language, class distinctions, and regional jurisdictions.Maitland, James, A Narrative of the Minority of Mary Queen of Scots, (Ipswich, 1842). Cleutin later wrote of his own embassy to England in peacetime, meaning perhaps February 1552 when his mission concerned the Debatable Lands, when John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland had criticised his role as ambassador of Scotland to his Scottish colleagues; > Don't you know to manage your own affairs without the help of French > ambassadors? You're making a big mistake to by putting yourself under their > care, and you won't be welcome with us.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, > (East Linton, 2000), p.383 quoting Teulet, Alexandre, ed., Relations > Politiques, vol.1 (Paris, 1862), 293. Jean Scheyfve recorded Cleutin's visit to England in February 1552, writing that he had 30 or 40 captains and soldiers with him, and had heard a rumour that other French troops had passed through Ireland from the garrisons in Scotland, and that some might pass through England. After visiting France he returned to England en route to Scotland in July, but did not visit the English court.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.10 (1914), 468, 549. =Paperwork goes astray= Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary was disturbed by her discoveries in Henri Cleutin's mail The peace concluded with England, France and Scotland after the war of the Rough Wooing (1543‚Äì1551) did not necessarily please Spain and the Empire, although a peace treaty with Charles V was concluded by Thomas, Master of Erskine in Antwerp on 1 May 1551.Cosmo Innes, Ledger of Andrew Halyburton (Edinburgh, 1867), pp. lxxxv-lxxxvi quoting a copy of the treaty in Edinburgh city archives. In October 1552, d'Oisel's papers and correspondence with Mary of Guise and Henry II of France was seized by three English agents working for Mary of Hungary, Queen Dowager Regent of the Low Countries while the packet was couriered between Calais and Boulogne.Baudouin-Matuszek (1989), 104: Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.10, 596. The papers included d'Oisel's accounts for the French garrisons in Scotland. Mary of Austria noted that d'Oisel used the title \\"Lieutenant- General of the King's Army in France and Superintendent of the King's three fortresses,\\" which were Eyemouth, Dunbar Castle, and Inchkeith. He was paymaster of 400 Gascon, Norman, and Breton troops. There was also a lengthy memoir to Henry II of France concerning how Scotland would be governed after Mary, Queen of Scotland, reached her majority, a subject debated by the French parliament in that year.Teulet, Alexandre, ed., Relations Politiques, vol. 1 (Paris, 1862), pp. 274-8. Mary of Guise feared Ch√¢telherault's powers might be increased. She and d'Oisel would dissemble their concerns for the time being. This memorandum continued on the subject of the arrest in Scotland of an Irishman, George Paris, who carried letters from France and England. Paris's trunk of letters had been seized by the Provost of Edinburgh and taken to Falkland Palace.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers (London, 1740), pp. 130-1, Dr Richard Smith to Nicolas Strelley, 11 November 1552. Mary of Hungary gave Thomas Gresham copies of this paper and secret instructions made for a French ambassador, Louis de Salazar, Sieur d'Asnois, in January 1549. Gresham forwarded the copies to William Cecil. Edward VI of England was told the news on 24 November 1552 and wrote the story in his journal.Jordan, W. K., The Chronicles and Political Papers of Edward VI, London (1966), 155. The 1549 instructions advised Salazar to foment a civil war in England during the trial of Admiral Thomas Seymour to aid France's war in Scotland.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 1 (1883), 100: Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, (London, 1740), 133-5, the copy has \\"Sieur d'Avoys\\": Salazar used the name \\"d'Anoys,\\" his diplomat instructions are published from the French Archives in Correspondence Politique de Odet de Selve (Paris, 1888), xviii, 481-484, no.528 & footnote. Although there is no further record of Salazar coming to England, these instructions may have seemed genuine, as the Imperial ambassador to France in 1549, Jean de Saint Mauris, had reported that the French court were pleased to hear of Thomas Seymour's arrest, and hoped a \\"pernicious struggle\\" in England would help conclude their Scottish undertaking. Saint Mauris wrote that the House of Guise helped military preparations to this end. Protector Somerset was informed that a messenger sent to France in January 1549 by Henry Cornysshe, Captain of Jersey, saw the Duke of Guise's preparations in Brittany, which Cornysshe judged were for Scotland.CSP Spain, vol. 9 (London, 1912), 334, 31 January 1549: HMC Marquess of Bath at Longleat: Seymour Papers, vol. 4 (1967), p. 107, Cornysshe to Somerset, 25 January 1549: Some older French histories state that French and Scotland benefited from division in England at the trial; e.g., Abb√© de Vertot, Ambassades de Messieurs de Noailles en Angleterre, vol. 1 (Leyden, 1763), p.299, citing Guillaume Paradin, vol.5 p.624. When Mary of Guise complained about the loss of these letters, the Dowager Regent replied that she found her letters to d'Oysel were inappropriate by not showing true and sincere friendship to the Emperor, and in fact expressed joy over the destruction and servitude of her own house (the House of Stewart).Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 10 (London, 1914), 585-588 footnote translates stolen memorandum in full, 596-604, 608. The English ambassador in Brussels, Thomas Chamberlayne, conveyed the Privy Council's thanks to Mary of Hungary's officers in December 1552.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, (London, 1740), 142-4. Simon Renard was told a story about d'Oisel plotting =Wyatt's confession= On 29 July 1553, the French ambassador in London, Antoine de Noailles, wrote of a rumour that 6,000 French troops would have aided Lady Jane Grey, \\"who didn't last ten days.\\" Henri Cleutin had attended the arrival of Queen Mary in London, and on 3 August they both had an audience with Mary. Already, Noailles noted, the ladies of the court had discarded the sombre garments worn at Edward's court and were dressed in gowns of rich cloth and colour in French fashions.Abb√© de Vertot, Ambassades de Messieurs de Noailles en Angleterre, vol.2. (Leyden, 1763), 88-92 & footnote p.90, Noailles to Henry II, 29 July 1553, 102, 104. In February 1554, the Imperial ambassador in England Simon Renard heard that Thomas Wyatt, who had conspired against Mary I of England, made an allegation against Henri Cleutin. Wyatt said that d'Oisel had spoken to his associate the soldier James Croft, asking him to hinder the marriage of Philip II and Mary Tudor, help place Princess Elizabeth on the throne, and marry her to Edward Courtenay, and have Mary Tudor executed. D'Oisel, Wyatt said, had made the same offer to Mr Rogers, Peter Carew, one named South, and William Pickering, the first dapifer, with promises of money, assistance and soldiers from France. The French King would attack England from Scotland and mount an assault on the English strongholds at Calais and Gu√Ænes during Wyatt's enterprise. While the plot failed and the English conspirators were arrested or fled, Renard said that the Admiral, the Earl of Derby and Earl of Westmorland were on war footing to resist the potential invasion. Renard said that the Princess Elizabeth was implicated by Cleutin's letters.Tytler, Patrick Fraser, England under the reigns Edward VI and Mary, vol.2, (Bentley, London, 1839), pp.306-313, Renard to Charles V, 24 February 1554, French & English translation. At the end of March, the English ambassador in France, Nicholas Wotton, questioned the Constable of France, Anne de Montmorency about the allegations against d'Oisel. Montmorency thought the plot sounded most implausible, and the French were perfectly content with Mary's rule in England. He doubted that d'Oisel would have put himself in such danger by speaking of such a plot as he travelled through England with his wife. Wotton told the Constable he would not have opened the matter with the Constable if the Queen of England did not believe it. Montmorency said it was a case of his word against your word.Tytler, Patrick Fraser, England under the reigns Edward VI and Mary, vol.2, (Bentley, London, 1839), pp.352-364, Wotton to Queen Mary, 31 March 1554. On 17 April 1554, Henry II congratulated Noailles for his defence of Cleutin against these allegations.Vertot, Ambassades, vol.3 (1763), p.161. Mary remained convinced of d'Oisel's involvement in the rebellion, and a month later wrote to Wotton mentioning; \\"the practice attempted by D'Oysel which, however much denied, is clearly manifest.\\"Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Mary: 1553-1558, vol (1861), no.199. Regency and Reformation When Guise became Regent of Scotland on 12 April 1554, d'Oisel rode with her from Holyroodhouse to the Tolbooth to collect the sword, scepter and crown from Arran.Lindsay, Robert, History of Scotland, vol. 2 Edinburgh (1814), p. 514. Cleutin is said to have placed the crown on her head and gave her the sword and sceptre, in a ceremony akin to a coronation.Rosalind K. Marshall, Scottish Queens: 1034-1714 (John Donald: Edinburgh, 2007), p. 120. Cleutin continued as a close advisor of the Dowager Queen Regent. In August 1554, he attended a performance of David Lyndsay's A Satire of the Three Estates with Mary of Guise in Edinburgh. The master of work William MacDowall built a special seat for them at the Greenside playfield, recorded as the 'Quenis grace' hous.'Adam, Robert, ed., Edinburgh Records: The Burgh Accounts, vol.1 (1899), 110: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol.10 (1913), 232. On 11 January 1554/5 Cleutin wrote a long letter to the Duke of Guise detailing the problems he perceived in Scotland that reduced revenue. The people needed to be ruled with a rod in the hand, desiring neither peace or justice. In frontier regions the heads of many families were no more than bandits, preying on Scots and English alike, of no value in peace or war. The many good islands were in poor estate, and French troops lightly armed in Scottish jacks would help the revenue of the Queen and Dowager. None of the Scottish fortresses would hold out for an hour against invasion, and he lacked men, a military engineer, wood, and lime for repairs.Michaud & Poujoulat, ed., Nouvelle collection des m√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire de France, vol.6 (1839), 222-3 In May 1556, an initiative which Buchanan attributed to d'Oysel and Yves de Rubay, keeper of the seals, was defeated by the Parliament of Scotland. Mary of Guise had hoped to raise new taxation for a standing army and fortifications on the border, and their proposal to compile an inventory of all property and incomes was opposed.Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707: CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898): Ritchie, Pamela E., Mary of Guise, (East Linton, 2002), 196-7. 109-110, 136-8. =War in 1557= Wark Castle Scotland and England were at war again in August 1557, and d'Oysel's troops re-occupied the fort at Eyemouth, and according to the Imperial ambassador in London, Simon Renard, made two successful raids on the border and burnt the hay stored at Berwick upon TweedCalendar State Papers Spain, vol.13 (1954), no.345: CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), notes date of a Berwick raid as the feast of Saint Remy, 1 October 1557. An English admiral, John Clere, was ordered to blockade Eyemouth to prevent guns landing there. Instead, he took his nine warships, which were notionally protecting the Iceland fishing fleet, to Kirkwall in Orkney. He landed and attacked the Bishop's Palace and Kirkwall Cathedral, but was repulsed and drowned with 97 of his men.CSP Spain, vol.13 (1954), no.345: Acts of the Privy Council, vol.6 (1893), 139, 173: Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol.3 part2 (Oxford, 1822), 86-7. The English border warden heard that at least six pieces of artillery were shipped to Eyemouth to demolish Cornwall Tower, Twizell bridge and Ford bridge. The army would try to take Wark Castle at the end of August. The operation was delayed, while 12 more guns were brought overland from Edinburgh, and the French garrison at Dunbar did not release more cannon until 6 October. The Earl of Shrewsbury thought delays were caused by worsening weather, flooding, and internal dissent. On 17 October, d'Oysel gave orders for the artillery to move forward to assault Wark. Four cannon crossed the swollen Tweed and two men and eight horses drowned. However the Scottish nobles were reluctant to go further as the weather conditions were now poor. They came to his campaign tent at Maxwellheugh, near Kelso, and, according to John Knox, told him flatly they would not invade England. The Earl of Shrewsbury wrote that d'Oysel, was \\"in great hevyness, and with high words ... wisshed himself in Fraunce.\\" English spies said the nobles had to restrain the Scottish commander, the Earl of Huntley, for a day.Ridpath, George, Border History of England and Scotland, Mercat (reprint) (1979), 401-5: Laing, David, ed., Works of John Knox, vol.1 (1846), 255: Ritchie, Pamela E., Mary of Guise (East Linton, 2002) 180-188, quoting a letter from the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lambeth Palace Library, Talbot Mss. 3195 fol.253: Lodge, Edmund, ed., Illustrations of English History, (1791), pp.206 no. XLI, 263-4 and footnote, 266, 270, 283, 284, 288. In this year William Kirkcaldy of Grange fought a duel with Ralph Eure, brother of the governor of Berwick, over the maltreatment of Grange's brother as a prisoner. Pitscottie wrote that Grange went to Berwick with d'Oysel and the garrison of Eyemouth, and it was agreed that none of the French or English soldiers would interfere with the combat.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, History of Scotland, (Edinburgh, 1778), 314. =Reformation crisis= Ch√¢telherault and d'Oysel faced the Protestant Lords of Scotland at Cupar Muir D'Oysel and the French interests in Scotland were now facing a greater threat from increasing support for religious reformation by the Scottish nobility. The Protestant Lords of the Congregation rose against the rule of Mary of Guise, opposed by the French troops commanded by d'Oysel alongside a Scottish army commanded by the former Regent Arran, the Duke of Ch√¢telherault. Pitscottie gives a good account of a stand-off in 1559 across the river Eden, at Cupar Muir in Fife, between the Protestant Lords and d'Oisel and Ch√¢telherault in command of the French and Scottish army. D'Oysel was swayed by the words of Patrick, Master of Lindsay from joining battle but first rode to the top of Tarvit Hill to spy out the strength of the opposition.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, History of Scotland, Edinburgh (1814), 536-545. Cleutin and Ch√¢telherault then signed an eight-day truce at Owlet Hill or Garliebank on 13 June 1559.Laing, David, ed., The Works of John Knox, (1846), 352-354, (the signature there reproduced which troubled the editor is simply a facsimile of a poor copy of \\"Cleutin.\\") The Congregation Lords subsequently occupied Edinburgh, and on 25 July 1559 d'Oysel signed the Articles of Leith on behalf of Mary of Guise. These were terms made for the withdrawal of the Congregation forces from Edinburgh to Stirling. In November 1559, d'Oisel worked with Jacques de la Brosse drawing up charges of treason against the Congregation Lords, Ch√¢telherault, and his son the Earl of Arran.Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, (East Linton, 2002),236-7. River Devon at Tullibody after an English fleet sailed into the Forth Two years later, the English ambassador in Paris, Nicholas Throckmorton was told that d'Oysel's colleagues in Scotland, Nicolas de Pellev√©, Bishop of Amiens, de la Brosse, and the newly arrived military commander Sebastien de Luxemburg, Seigneur de Martigues, came up with the idea of holding a Parliament. The dissenting lords who attended would be arrested and executed. D'Oysel and Mary of Guise were said to have disagreed and vetoed this plan.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.3 (1865), no.619. D'Oysel and Captain Sarlabous took the town of Stirling without opposition on Christmas Day 1559. They marched into Fife and met up with reinforcements who had sailed from Leith on 7 January 1560 at Pettycur Bay near Kinghorn. An attack by the Congregation was beaten off.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.2 (1865), no.572 note, translating Teulet, vol.1, p.404: Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 280-2: Works of John Knox: History of the Reformation in Scotland, vol.2 (1848), 5-7. Later in January d'Oysel was marching troops towards the Protestant stronghold of St Andrews when the English fleet commanded by William Winter was sighted in the Firth of Forth. Winter captured two ships laden with supplies intended for his assault on St Andrews. According to John Knox, Raphael Holinshed, and Pitcottie, William Kirkcaldy of Grange destroyed the bridge at Tullibody to cut off Cleutin's retreat to Stirling. To bridge the Devon, a French engineer in his company dismantled the roof of Tullibody Kirk. The French were delayed by a day without provisions at Forth-Rig Muir or Clackmannan.Laing, David, ed., 'John Knox's 'History of the Reformation', Book 3,' The Works of John Knox, vol. 2, (Bannatyne Club, Edinburgh, 1848), 14 In February 1560 Cleutin came from Stirling to Edinburgh and burnt Arran's Kinneil House on the way.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 313. When the Chester Herald, William Flower, delivered a message from Norfolk claiming that the English fleet had arrived in the Firth by accident, d'Oisel replied in defiance, \\"What got Mary Tudor by her last wars?\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 322. On 18 March 1560 he defeated a small Scots force at the battle of Glasgow bridge. On 29 March, an English army crossed the border and besieged Leith, which the French had heavily fortified. The army, commanded by Grey of Wilton, arrived at Restalrig on 6 April. Grey sent a message to Cleutin that they should parley, but with the advice of Martigues and de la Brosse he refused.Dickinson, Gladys, ed., Two Missions, (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942), 65, 85-6, 99. After Mary of Guise died in June 1560 the siege of Leith continued. According to Holinshed, d'Oisel vowed to defend the poor of the town who were gathering cockles on the shore from the English on 4 July, but the English attacked anyway. (A French journal of the siege places this event in May.) He was still within the town at the end of the siege. When peace was concluded, Sir Francis Leake and Sir Gervase Clifton came to his lodging for a banquet where no meat or fish was served, except one dish of horse.: but see also Two Missions of De La Brosse, SHS (1942) D'Oisel left Scotland on 18 July 1560 in the English ship, the Minion with 40 companions.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 426, 449, 455. Early commentators lay the blame for the failure of Mary of Guise's policies on the other French advisors, de la Brosse, Martigues, and de Rubay, rather than on d'Oysel.Maxwell, John, Historical Memoirs of Mary Queen of Scots, (Abbotsford Club, 1836), 50. In October 1560 Nicholas Throckmorton heard Cleutin was out of favour in France due to his opposition to the plan to execute the Protestant lords, but was given leave to go home to Villeparis. In September 1561 Cleutin visited Throckmorton in Paris, saying he had been a friend to Mary, Queen of Scots and the House of Guise. Cleutin then travelled to London to obtain a passport and safe-conduct for Mary, Queen of Scots' voyage to Scotland. Elizabeth did not oblige, wishing Mary to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh which d'Oisel had helped draft, and kept d'Oisel waiting. William Maitland approved of this, but learnt that Mary would sail anyway.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 413, 538-40, 444. On 6 October 1561 Throckmorton went to the H√¥tel de Guise and d'Oysel brought him to speak to the Duke himself.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.4 (1866), no.494, 592. Religious affairs Cleutin returned to France and continued to serve Mary. He fought at the battle of Dreux in December 1562 and was made a Knight by Charles IX. In September 1562 he was in Heidelberg where his purpose was to declare against the opinion of Fran√ßois de Coligny d'Andelot that the troubles in France were not caused by religion.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.5, (1867), no.576. At the end of 1563 he was to speak to the Pope on behalf of Charles IX of France asking him not to take action against the Protestant Kingdom of Navarre.CSP Vatican, vol.1 (1916), no.291 He became France's diplomat in Rome in January 1564.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.7 (1870), no.75 Brant√¥me gave a lengthy anecdote of his conduct there as a man of the sword rather than a man of letters, and Lebourier published two of Cleutin's letters to Bernardin Bochetel illustrating his temperament.Le Labourier, Jean, ed., Les memoires de Messire Michel de Castelnau, vol.1, Brussels (1731), 432-8 In March 1565, Thomas Randolph heard he was in Rome trying to arrange for Mary to marry the Charles IX of France.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), 130. =Mary and Darnley= Cleutin's correspondence during the discussions on a Papal dispensation for the marriage of Mary and Lord Darnley does not survive in the Vatican Archives. Cleutin wrote to Charles IX on 15 April 1566, to say that news of the murder of David Riccio and Mary's plight had reached Rome by several letters, although he had not yet been informed himself or discussed the events with the Pope. He had heard a muddled report that Mary, who was pregnant, had fled from Edinburgh to a castle, but was brought back to Edinburgh by Darnley, and now wished to escape to France. The Bishop of Dumblane arrived with the official news on 26 April.Pollen, John Hungerford, ed., Papal Negotiations with Mary of Scots, Scottish History Society (1901), p.195 footnote, 452-3 (the events of Spring 1566, not 1567). =Epitaph in Rome= On 10 June 1566 Henri Cleutin wrote to Catherine de' Medici asking for permission to travel to Lucca to seek a remedy for his grave illness.Pollen, John Hungerford, ed., Papal Negotiations with Mary of Scots (Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1901), 454. He died in Rome later in June 1566 and was buried in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi.

His mother was very much interested in music so she made every possible effort for a musical education of her children. His highschool music teacher stimulated him to play the violin so he started with private violin courses. His teacher was Marie-Louise Graef-M√∂nch, the assistant of Alma Moodie, who taught him in the tradition of Carl Flesch. After graduation he still got these courses and also some in the home of the H√∂lscher family where he befriended with Gert H√∂lscher (1930‚Äì2010) who especially cultivated his musical efforts. There he met the pianist G√ºnter Ludwig. At Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts he studied with Marie-Louise Graef- M√∂nch, his former private violin teacher. During a university competition in Hamburg, Kottmann was awarded. After his concerto exam he initially was employed as violin teacher at Odenwaldschule.

It features many aspects typical of the Queen Anne Style, but its comparative austerity is typical of Stick-Eastlake designs. Porch columns and the second floor balcony are particularly representative of the Eastlake Movement. The only significant change to the exterior is a 1920s one-story addition on the southwest corner of the house. A carriage house, built in 1890, still stands in the backyard. On the interior, the oak staircase in the foyer was laid against a wall with glass windows to the exterior. A Czech chandelier hangs over the staircase.

It has an elevation of 3,597 m above sea. It is part of the Ghegam Ridge volcanic field, which last erupted at 1900 BC ¬± 1000 years. There is a lake in the crater of volcano Azhdahak that is formed from melting snow. From the top of the mountain opens the pictorial landscape of mountains Ararat, Hatis, Ara, Aragats, Lake Sevan, the whole Gegham mountains and the Kotayk valley. In the surroundings of Azhdahak there is a lake, Akna ( Aknalich), of volcanic origin. ‚ÄúAkn‚Äù means \\"spring (water)\\" in Armenian. Geology The compound slag cone of Azhdahak, figures as a large strewn structure up to 1600m in diameter and about 370m high. The total area of volcano lavas, partly eroded and overlapped by the streams of Tar is around 8 square km. The cone is formed with slags, lapilli, sands, ashes, debris, lava boulders, slag, twisting, composite and spindle-shaped volcanic bombs. Fauna and flora thumb Bird fauna of Gegham Mountain Range includes about 250 species, what makes up 70% of all Armenia's avifauna. Stony slopes are an irreplaceable habitat for birds of prey, such as: * Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) * Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) * Cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) * Imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) * Griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) * Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) On the snow-covered slopes, traces of brown bear (Ursus arctos) are often found. For the area of Gegham Mountains and surroundings of Azhdahak are typically found the following plants: * Jurinea moschus * Arabis caucasica * Catsfoot diclinous (Antennaria dioica), * Gentiana pontica * Red everlasting (Helichrysum pallasii), * Lady's-mantle (Alchemilla grossheimii), * Alpine cinquefoil (Potentilla crantzi), * Sibbaldia (Sibbaldia parviflora), * Merendera Radde (Colchicum raddeanum), * Oxytrope Lazica (Oxytropis lazica), * Vavilovia Oshe (Vavilovia formosa) Rock carvings A great number of petroglyphs ‚Äì rock-carvings has been found in the surroundings of Azhdahak. Most images depict men in scenes of hunting and fighting, as well as astronomical bodies and phenomena: the Sun, the Moon, constellations, the stellar sky, lightning, etc. Settlements near Azhdahak In Gegham mountains are engaged the cattle breeding people called Yazidi ‚Äì one of national minorities of Armenia, who move to the mountains for the summer and live in tents with families and even with infants. The Yazidis are an ethno- confessional group, whose main identity is religion; Yazidism or Sharfadin. Nomadic stockbreeding is their major occupation. The Yazidi society is a caste system including three main components: the Shaykhs, the Pirs (clergy) and murids (laymen). Tourism and hiking The beauty of the Azhdahak surroundings have long attracted tourists. However, the probability of running across each other different hiking groups is insignificant. It depends on the remoteness from the civilization, orientation complexities, that aggravate with weather condition factors, such as: thunder and lightning, hail and snow, fog with visibility down to 2-3m.

In 1863, Gustave Dor√© produced a large set of drawings based on Don Quixote. On 10 August 1955, Pablo Picasso drew an illustration of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza for the journal weekly Les Lettres fran√ßaises (week of 18‚Äì24 August 1955), which quoted from the Daumier caricature of a century before. Widely reproduced, today it is the iconic image used by the Spanish government to promote Cervantes and Don Quixote.

It first appeared in 1842 in Browning's Dramatic Lyrics, where it was known simply as \\"France\\". The poem is written in 21 verses. \\"Count Gismond: Aix in Provence\\" may, on one reading, be seen as a story of the vindication of innocence. A woman relates to a friend an episode of her own life, when a defender arose for her when she was caught in the toils woven by the unsuspected envy and hypocrisy of her cousins and Count Gauthier, who attempt to bring dishonor upon her on her birthday, with an accusation that she and Gauthier had been lovers. Her faith that the trial by combat between Gauthier and Gismond must end in Gismond's victory and her vindication reflects, in this reading, the medieval atmosphere of an idealised chivalrous France. However an alternative reading of the poem, suggested by various hints in the verse (e.g. the absence of the narrator's denial of her relationship with Gauthier, the evasive way she breaks off her story when Gismond arrives), hints that the woman may be an 'unreliable narrator', as in the poem 'My Last Duchess'. On a third interpretation, the ambiguity between these two readings is the poem's major attribute.Alison Case: 'Browning's \\"Count Gismond\\": A Canvas for Projection', Victorian Poetry Vol 34/2 1996 Sources  External links  * Count Gismond - the text of the poem * Analysis Poetry by Robert Browning British poems 1842 poems Gismond ","title":"Count Gismond"},{"id":"28985816","text":"The Caney Fork and Western Railroad is a shortline railroad operating since 1983 from a connection with CSX Transportation at Tullahoma to McMinnville, Tennessee, and ends in Sparta, Tennessee .

The resolution marked the first time the Council had broadened the protection framework by identifying other categories of violations against children. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council remained concerned over the lack of progress towards the protection of children affected by armed conflict, though noted some advances in the areas of advocacy and norms and standards. It called on states to end impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and others. The Council reiterated its commitment to address the impact of conflict on children and emphasised the importance of unimpeded access to children affected by armed conflict. Furthermore, it noted that enlisting children under the age of 15 into the national armed forces was classified as a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child required a minimum age of 18 to be set for compulsory recruitment in hostilities. The preamble of the resolution also stressed the Council's determination to ensure respect for international standards for the protection of children. =Acts= The resolution began by condemning the use and recruitment of child soldiers, the killing and maiming of children, rape, sexual violence, abduction, forced displacement, denial of humanitarian access, attacks against schools and hospitals, child trafficking, forced labour and slavery. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to devise a comprehensive monitoring mechanism within three months on the recruitment and use of child soldiers and abuses committed against children. At the same time, the Council expressed its intention to consider further measures to end the link between the illegal trade of resources, arms trafficking, cross-border abduction, recruitment and armed conflict. All concerned parties were urged to respect international obligations applicable to them. The Council was concerned at the continued recruitment of child soldiers by certain parties and called upon the parties to have plans ready in three months to end the use and recruitment of child soldiers, requested the Secretary-General to regularly review their compliance and expressed the intention to impose further measures against parties or countries that had not co-operated, such as arms embargoes. Meanwhile, it was decided to keep provisions specifically relating to the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, including the deployment of child protection advisers. Such provisions for children would also be included in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes, and the Council emphasised that education would play an important role in the prevention of the recruitment of children in armed conflict. Furthermore, the resolution requested the United Nations to implement HIV/AIDS education, testing and counselling services. It welcomed arrangements by regional and subregional organisations such as the European Union and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for the protection of children, encouraging the mainstreaming of such policies through advocacy, policies and programmes, developing monitoring mechanisms, establishing child protection mechanisms and the inclusion of child protection staff. The Council encouraged the strengthening of regional and local institutions. Finally, the Secretary-General was urged to ensure that the protection of children was given consideration in his future reports to the Council, and was requested to report by 31 October 2004 on the implementation of resolutions 1379 and 1460, including progress on a monitoring mechanism.

In the late 1860s, George Oliver moved to Boston, Mass., where he opened a second art restoration shop. Eventually, the New York location was closed. = Early 20th Century- Innovation = In time, George‚Äôs two sons, brothers George T. (\\"Taylor\\") and Frederick Oliver (grandsons of original founder James), joined and eventually took over the family business, which, for the first time, would operate under the name \\"Oliver Brothers\\". Taylor perfected several procedures for removing surface blemishes and transferring paintings on canvasses with defective supports. In the 1920s, he designed and constructed a prototype vacuum hot table to use in his process for relining paintings, for which he received a patent in 1937 ‚Äì U.S. Patent# 2,073,802.U.S. Patent# 2,073,802 :\\"Art of Oil Painting Restoration\\"- March 16, 1937 The vacuum hot table has since been adopted throughout the art restoration and conservation industry for use in restoring paintings on textile supports.Stoner, J.H.

The compound is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in clinical trials for various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and glioma. Crenolanib is an orally bioavailable benzamidazole that selectively and potently inhibits signaling of wild-type and mutant isoforms of class III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) FLT3 (FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3), PDGFR Œ± (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor), and PDGFR Œ≤. Unlike most RTK inhibitors, crenolanib is a type I mutant-specific inhibitor that preferentially binds to phosphorylated active kinases with the ‚ÄòDFG in‚Äô conformation motif.  Background  Type III Receptor tyrosine kinase, including FLT3, PDGFRŒ± and PDGFRŒ≤, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematological malignancies. Mutations of FLT3 comprise one of the most frequently identified types of genetic alterations in Angiomyolipoma. Approximately one-third of AML patients present with a mutation in this gene. The majority of these mutations result in constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways and aberrant cell growth. Mutations in FLT3 have also been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Activating mutations in PDGFRA have been detected in 5-12% of Gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Fusion of PDGFRA has been found to be responsible for hematological malignances like hypereosinophilic syndrome. The amplification of chromosome 4q12, the site of the PDGFRA gene, has been identified in 13-29% of adult gliomas and in 29% to 36% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), a subset of high-grade gliomas (HGG) in pediatric patients. Activation of PDGFRB, a third member of the type III RTK family, has been implicated in the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia due to the fusion of PDGFRB with the TEL gene. Furthermore, PDGFB translocation to the COL1A1 gene locus has been identified to be responsible for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). In cancer cells, PDGFR promotes tumor development and migration via proto-oncogenic downstream mediators like AKT and MEK. In stromal fibroblasts, PDGFRŒ± activation leads to local tissue invasion, production and secretion of VEGF, and elevated intratumoral interstitial pressure. In stromal pericytes, PDGFRŒ≤ activation mediates vascular stability. Thus, either FLT3 or PDGF/PDGFR pathway is the primary driver of oncogenesis in the above malignancies and can be targeted by crenolanib therapy.  Mechanism  =FLT3: wild-type and mutant= Crenolanib inhibits both wild type FLT3 and its constitutively active mutations. In vitro studies have shown that crenolanib has low Kd for the FLT3 enzyme with constitutively activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, D835H and D835Y, as compared to wild type. Crenolanib tightly binds to FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835H and FLT3-D835Y with Kd of 0.74 nM, 0.4 nM, and 0.18 nM, respectively. Crenolanib inhibits the phosphorylation of the FLT3-ITD receptor in transfected TF-1 cells and the FLT3-D835Y TKD mutation in transfected Ba/F3 cells at nanomolar IC50 concentrations of 1.3 nM and 8.8 nM, respectively. Immunoblot experiments performed in the Molm14 FLT3-ITD positive cell line show that crenolanib inhibits downstream signaling of FLT3 at a concentration of 10 nM. MTT assay measurements of crenolanib cytotoxicity evaluated in the FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines Molm14 and MV411, showed that crenolanib is toxic at IC50 concentrations of 7 nM and 8 nM, respectively. =PDGFRŒ±: wild-type and mutant= Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit PDGFRŒ± with an IC50 of 0.4 ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing PDGFRŒ±, crenolanib inhibited the phosphorylation of wild type PDGFRŒ± at an IC50 of 10 nM. Additionally, crenolanib completely blocked PDGFRŒ± phosphorylation and downstream AKT signaling at a concentration between 0.1 and 1 uM in Ink4a/Arf-/- mouse astrocytes transfected to stably co-express both human PDGFRŒ± and PDGF AA. The lung cancer cell line H1703, which is reported to have amplification of both PDGFRA (4q12) and PDGFC (4q32) genes on chromosome 4, and also overexpress PDGFRŒ±, was sensitive to crenolanib with an IC50 of ~80 nM. In CHO cells expressing an activating exon 18 (D842V) PDGFRŒ± mutation, crenolanib was effective at an IC50 of 6nM and IC90 of 25nM. In addition, crenolanib also inhibited phosphorylation of the double mutants PDGFRŒ± (V561D + D842V and T674I + D842V). =PDGFRŒ≤: wild-type= Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit PDGFRŒ≤ with an IC50 of 0.8 ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines. Crenolanib inhibits the ability of recombinant PDGFRŒ≤ to phosphorylate a synthetic tyrosine substrate (poly-glutamic acid-tyrosine), with an IC50 of 0.4 ng/mL. Evaluation of the antitumor activity of crenolanib in a genetically engineered BSG DIPG mouse model showed that it is highly selective for PDGFRŒ≤ with an IC50 of 10 nM when measured by BrdU assay and 1.25 uM by MTT assay. =C-Kit: wild-type and mutant= Crenolanib has been shown to have IC50 and Kd values of 67 nM and 78 nM, respectively, for wild type c-KIT in in vitro assays. Similar assays show that crenolanib inhibits c-KIT activating mutations D816H and D816V with IC50 concentrations of 5.4 and 2.5 nM, respectively. Human bone marrow progenitor cell growth assays showed that crenolanib has modest effects on GM-CSF and BFUE driven colony formation at the IC50 concentration of 20 nM.  Clinical  Phase I single-agent and Phase Ib combination studies have investigated the clinical pharmacology of crenolanib in patients with cancer. Pharmacokinetic and safety studies of Crenolanib administered alone or in combination with docetaxel with or without axitinib have been completed. Results suggest that Crenolanib is well tolerated as a single agent, and can also be safely combined with docetaxel and axitinib due to their non-overlapping toxicity profiles.

It has been built in large numbers, serving as the powerplant for the Antonov An-12 transport and the Ilyushin Il-18 airliner. Design and development The AI-20 was the first gas turbine engine developed by the design bureau led by Aleksandr Ivchenko based at Zaporizhia, USSR, which had previously concentrated on small piston engines such as the Ivchenko AI-14 and AI-26 radials. It was designed as a prospective powerplant for the new, large Ilyushin Il-18 airliner and the Antonov An-10, to be powered by four turboprops, in competition with the Kuznetsov NK-4 engines. Both engines were tested on the preproduction batch of 20 Il-18s, but the Ivchenko engine was chosen for full production, possibly due to a crash caused by an inflight failure of an NK-4 engine, and possibly due to the desire for the engines of the Ukrainian An-10 to also be built in Ukraine. The Il-18B was powered by four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each providing a takeoff power of 2,985 kW (4,000 shp) and sustained power of 2,090 kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude. Early Il-18A production had initially been fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, but they were soon exchanged for AI-20s. Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart. The AI-20 is a single-shaft turboprop with a ten-stage axial compressor and a three-stage power turbine, and is designed to run at a constant speed. A big problem with early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a time between overhauls (TBO) in the range of 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours ‚Äì unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and high noise levels were a problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600‚Äì750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M. Serial production was carried out at Zaporozhye (Motor Sich) and at Perm Engine Plant (UEC-Perm Engines), USSR in 1958, also being built under licence in China as the WJ-6. About 14,000 AI-20s have been built in total. Variants ;AI-20A series 1: :Initial production variant for early version of IL-18 producing 2,985 kW (4,000 shp). TBO was horrendous at 200‚Äì400 hrs. ;AI-20A series 2: :Improved production variant with same power ratings but technical improvements; older airplanes were updated with the Series 2 engines. TBO was still poor (600‚Äì750 hrs) ;AI-20K: :Reliability and durability was addressed with this much improved variant. TBO went up to 2,000 hours. This became the standard production variant. ;AI-20M: :This variant was a significant improvement over the earlier engine variants in all respects. The AI-20M raised takeoff power from 2,985 kW (4,000 shp) to 3,169 kW (4,250 shp), improving takeoff performance under \\"hot and high\\" conditions and permitting higher takeoff weights. Higher continuous power ratings were also attained (2700 shp) which made for more efficient cruise. Beyond these, the AI-20M also had good reliability, was lighter, and in particular featured much improved SFC. ;AI-20D: :This variant saw significant improvement in power output. Fuel economy was also marginally improved. AI-20D is also often referred to as AI-20D series 4. Power was uprated to a massive 5,180 shp. ;AI-20D series 5: :This variant builds on the previous success of the series 4 variant. Most performance parameters remained the same with the only major improvement being in the area of reliability and durability. The TBO/Service life was improved to 6000 hrs / 20,000 hrs respectively. ;AI-20D series 5M or AI-20DM: :This is the final variant developed. The AI-20DM is essentially the same with the AI-20D series 5, the only difference being in the power setting. The AI-20DM is derated to 4,750 shp (take-off power) which allows the engine to have extended life and increased TBO. The Time before overhaul (TBO) is consequently increased to 8000 hrs with a Service life of 22,000 hrs.

Its capital and royal residence was in the town of Fashoda. According to their folk history and neighboring accounts, the kingdom was founded during the mid-fifteenth century CE by its first ruler, the demigod Nyikang. During the nineteenth century, the Shilluk were affected by military assaults from the Ottoman Empire and later British colonization in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Shilluk king is currently not an independent political leader, but a traditional chieftain within the governments of South Sudan and Sudan. The current Shilluk king is His Majesty Reth Kwongo Dak Padiet who ascended to the throne in 1993.https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00147-EN.pdf The monarchy (the Reth) has been political and religious in nature. The monarch guaranteed social order; his health and the health of the nation were intertwined. Worship is performed in rituals inspired by the national myth of Nyikang, the first Reth. The Shilluk monarchy and the beliefs of its people was studied in 1911 by Charles Seligman and in 1916 by British anthropologist James George Frazer in The Golden Bough. Seligman described the Shilluk form of government as a \\"sacred kingship\\".  Geography and people  The kingdom was located along a strip of land along the western and eastern bank of White Nile and sobat river, from Lake No to about 12¬∞ north latitude. The Shilluk people are closely related to the commoner South Sudanese ethnic groups, the Nuer and Dinka (their neighbors to the south and east, respectively). Their language is related to that of the Anuak people near the rivers Baro and Pibor. The English name for the Shilluk language derives from the Arabic version of the Shilluk self-designation: C√∏ll√∏, or Chollo. This (and a belief by many Shilluk) suggests a common origin with the Acholi, another ethnic group living on the Ugandan-South Sudanese and Luo in Tanzania, Kenya, DRC, Chad, CAR and Ethiopia (Anuak) borders Like most Nilotic peoples of South Sudan (such as the Nuer and Dinka), the Shilluk practiced subsistence semi-nomadic cattle breeding and some grain farming.\\"Shilluk.\\" Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Volume 1 Infobase Publishing, 2009 Their social system was egalitarian, and the cattle herds had great symbolic value. The lifestyle of the modern Shilluk is similar, except that their herds are smaller. They were sedentary, because the land along the White Nile is more fertile than elsewhere in the region. Their cultivation of durra, a variety of sorghum (millet), made them a relatively prosperous agricultural people except during prolonged droughts. Today's Shilluk population was estimated at 1.7 million in 2005; during the nineteenth century they were estimated at about 200,000, living in hundreds of villages. The kingdom was divided into two provinces: Gher (G√§r√∏) in the north and Luak (Lwag√∏) in the south. These, in turn, were divided into zones.  History  = Origins and migration = Aturwik, the homestead mound of the Shilluk king at Fashoda with his four huts built on top. Photo by Charles Gabriel Seligman According to Shilluk legends, the kingdom was founded in 1490. Its legendary first ruler (\\"Reth\\") was the hero known as Nyikang who claimed to be half-crocodile and possessed power over the rain. Nyikang was the son of a king, Okwa, who ruled a country located \\"far south near a large lake\\". This may be Lake Albert, where the Acholi live. After Okwa's death, Nyikang went to war with his brother Duwadh, the legitimate successor to the throne. Facing defeat, Nyikang left his homeland with his retinue and migrated northeast to Wau (near the Bahr el Ghazal, \\"river of gazelles\\" in Arabic). Here (known by the Shilluk as the Pothe Thuro) Nyikang married the daughter of Dimo, the local magician. After a conflict with Dimo Nyikang migrated north (crossing the Bahr el Ghazal) to Acietagwok (a Shilluk village about west of the village of Tonga) around 1550. Nyikang then traveled to Nyilual, an uninhabited region west of the present town of Malakal.Oyler 1918, p. 108 In the end, legends claim that Nyikang vanished in a whirlwind in the middle of a battle. = Kingdom = The state along the Sahel in 1750  Border conflicts  During the 17th century, to ensure a surplus of resources the Shilluk raided and looted neighbouring populations north and south along the White Nile. The looting was usually conducted by heads of podh (clusters of villages). The Shilluk king (Reth) was no exception; the Reth of the south would send his Shilluk warriors upstream to Dinka lands. Reserving the largest share of the plunder, the Reth increased his possessions and his influence on the Shilluk country through his armed men, Bath Reth. The timing of these events remains obscure, and it is unclear whether the Reth is a figure from a single dynasty or several Reth coexisted. If the latter, there may have been a dozen different dynasties.Graeber 2010, pp. 13‚Äì14 Between the reign of King Odak Ochollo (circa 1600‚Äì1635) and 1861, the Shilluk tried to expand its northern border militarily. The portion of the valley of the White Nile between the villages of Muomo and Asalaya was unfavourable for agriculture; however, the northern savannah provided an abundance of game, fish and honey. To control trade on the White Nile Odak Ochollo made an alliance with the Sultanate of Darfur, supporting it in its fight against the ethnic Funj of the Sennar Sultanate. By 1630, the Dinka south and west of the Shilluk country invaded the southern border of the Sultanate of Sennar. The progression of the Dinka continued through the 17th and 18th centuries, towards the Gezira region. Before this changed the strategic balance, the Shilluk and Funj united against the Dinka and checked them militarily. This era marked the beginning of Shilluk economic ties to other groups (Funj, Arabs, European merchants and Mahdists).  Golden Age  After 1650 the Shilluk population (despite its diversity) appeared to gain a sense of national unity, accompanied by a strengthening of royal authority. The Reth and a more-centralized government established a monopoly of economic resources and trade. This consolidation is primarily due to the military success of the Shilluk King Dhokoth (circa 1670‚Äì1690). Looting continued upstream along the White Nile in Dinka territory and westward to the Nuba Mountains. In 1684, a drought destroyed the Shilluk crops. Driven by hunger, many men took up arms and went down the river to the Arabized peoples of present Sudan. These lootings were orchestrated from the river; men in canoes would raid the northern Arab regions. During this time the White Nile was known as the Bahr al-Scheluk, the \\"river of Shilluk\\". King Tug√∏ (R√§dh Tug√∏) (circa 1690‚Äì1710), son of R√§dh Dh√∏k√∂√∂dh√∏, founded Fashoda as the permanent residence of the Shilluk kings and set up elaborate rituals and investiture ceremonies. The Shilluk Kingdom reached its peak in the 18th century, as the Sultanate of Sennar declined in power. The Shilluk kings took the disappearance of Sennar from the political scene as an opportunity to strengthen their position on the northern frontier. The caravans were under the influence of the Shilluk kings, and were enriched by the shuttle service made available by the Shilluk to merchants wishing to cross the White Nile to Asalaya when travelling between Sennar and El Obeid. The Shilluk Kingdom expanded its territory up to the area where Khartoum was later built, and defeated numerous attempted invasions by the northern peoples.  Decline and restoration  In 1786, the Funj Sultanate of Sennar began a period of decline.E.A. Robinson, \\"Nimr, the Last King of Shendi\\", Sudan Notes and Records, 8 (1925), p. 105 Sultan Adlan II was troubled by his war with the Hameg tribe established south of the town of Er Roseires, following 30 years of anarchy and looting by Sheikh Nasser Hameg. In 1820 the Viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, began his southern campaign to conquer the Sudan. That year, the Turkish-Egyptian troops of Ismail Pasha also put a final end to the Sultanate of Funj. Confrontation between the Ottomans and Shilluk become inevitable. Beginning in 1821, despite resistance from the Shilluk, the northern border began to recede. The first confirmed slave raid by northerners into Shilluk land occurred in 1826. From then on, the kingdom was increasingly targeted by raiders. During the reign of Reth Nyokwej√∏ (Y√∂r, Nyokwej√∏ w√§d Kwond√Ød (Nyikw√´y√∏) kwar Okon√∏ w√§d Tug√∏) (circa 1780‚Äì1820) a united force of Dinka and Nuer crossed the river Sobat, which cost the Shilluk total control of the White Nile. By 1865, the Shilluk Kingdom had lost part its political standing. Present Shilluk (Chollo) Kingdom is known by Sudanese as P√∂dh C√∏ll√∏ (Sudan) after the independence of the Republic of Sudan ‚àí1956 to-date. Today, Shilluk Kingdom is part of present Republic of South Sudan and the current Shilluk King is Reth Kwongo Dak Padiet who was to succeed to Rethship in 1993 after the death of the previous Reth Ayang Aney Kur in 1992.  Culture  = Social structure =  Lineage (Kwa)  The word Kwa means \\"grandfather\\" or \\"ancestor\\". Kwaar√∏ and Kwari have similar meanings, but imply descent: \\"grandchild\\" and \\"down\\".Westermann 1912, p. 264 They are the Shilluk equivalents of \\"lineage\\" and \\"clan\\". The members of a Kwa descend from the same ancestor, the Kwar Kwa; Kwar Ok√´√´l√∏ means all the descendants of Ok√´√´l√∏ (the name of a person). This system is also used with legendary characters. More than 100 lineages have been studied, and it was to know one's lineage.Pumphrey 1941, pp. 6‚Äì7 Examples of Kwa are:Westermann 1912, pp. 127‚Äì134 ‚Äì from a complete list of 74 Kwa *The Kwa Ajal√∏ was founded by Jal√∏, an exile with Nyikaang√∏ (Nyikang). * The Kwa M√∏n√∏ was founded by M√∏n√∏, a servant Nyikaa≈ã√∏ met when he arrived in the Shilluk country. * The Kwa Ju was founded by Ju, half-brother of Nyikaang√∏. * The Kwa Tugi was founded by Tug√∏, a spirit which Nyikaang√∏ found in a river. * The Kwa Tuga was founded by Tuga, an Arab whose sister married Nyikaang√∏.  Group (P√∂dh√∏)  Late 19th- century Shilluk warrior The p√∂dh√∏, or grouping, may refer to any grouped set, the Shilluk country, a group or a federation. In the latter context, p√∂dh√∏ refers to a group of villages inhabited by several lineages which unite for mutual defense under a single leader. This federation of hamlets is the basis of Shilluk social structure. The region has over 100 p√∂dh√∏.Pumphrey, 7 Before and during the British colonization, these lineages united against the threat of tribal wars. However, during peacetime the communities dissolved because of internal strife; many people faced a conflict of allegiance between their podh leader and the leader of their Kwar. Originally, Nyikang gave each lineage a podh as its home territory. If this line still exists, it is considered the owner of the land and its members are known as dyil. The other lines living in the area from later migrations are known as w√´dhdh. If the ruling dy√´ll family dies out, the rights go to the second-oldest lineage in the area. The lineage of the dy√´ll theoretically provides the podh with its leader, but authority may revert to the most-important lineage. In this case, the original lineage retains its prestige and land-ownership rights. Some groups (such as the Odong Panyikang) have adopted a rotation system of authority between the two (or three) most-important lines.Pumphrey 1941, 6‚Äì7  Hamlet (Paj√∏)  Shilluk paj√∏ Shilluk King, Reth Ayang Aney Kur with Chinese ‚Äì Fashoda, 1979 Within each group (podh) are hamlets (paj√∏). The pac is inhabited by individuals from the same lineage. Some hamlets may consist of only one dwelling, but others may have more than fifty. The paj√∏ is a family in its broadest sense. A traditional dwelling consists of two huts (gol) separated by a small space enclosed by millet stalks or coarse grass mats. The homes are built around a large common pen for goats and cows. A large hut (lwag√∏) houses livestock during the rainy season. During the rest of the year, the hut is a hostel for foreign guests and a town hall.Pumphrey 1941, pp. 7‚Äì8  Family (g√∏l√∏,or \\"kal√∏\\" gool)  By extension, gol or \\"kal√∏\\" or (\\"home\\") also means \\"family\\". In the latter sense, the gol is the smallest unit of Shilluk society. An unmarried man does not have his own home; unmarried individuals are attached to their father's gol. If his father has died, the single person joins the gol of his oldest living married brother. The owner of the house is the head of his family, responsible for its inhabitants and the family herd. Since the traditional remedy for an offense is payment in cattle, the head of the family (not the wrongdoer) is responsible for the offense.Pumphrey 1941, p. 9 = Classes = The Shilluk people were divided into four classes.  Kwareth  The Kwareth (kwa, \\"ancestor\\"; reth, \\"king\\") is the royal clan of descendants of Nyikang. This group is widely distributed, with its members having the greatest number of wives. Although it currently has no political authority, members of this class form a rural aristocracy. Members hold one of four titles:Pumphrey 1941, p. 10 *Reth: The regent, who succeeds through male primogeniture *Nyireth: Prince or princess; if male, the heir presumptive *Nyareth: son of a nyireth *Kwar Nyireth: son of a lesser nyireth  Ororo (Oror√∏)  The Oror√∏ is a branch of the royal line which has lost its place in the line of succession. Its members are similar to the rest of the population, except for their ritual functions in connection with royalty.Pumphrey 1941, pp. 12‚Äì14 During the reign of King Odaag√∏, the Shilluk were defeated by the Dinka after a battle against the Anuaks. After this setback, it was decided at a council of war to enlist all princes in battle the next day. The conscripted army crossed the river to battle, except for Prince Duwadh (D√Øw√§√§d√∏ w√§d Oc√∏ll√∏). The battle was a massacre, in which all the princes were killed. Duwadh became king, and demoted every son of the dead princes to the C√∏ll√∏ class. Since then, only descendants of Duwadh were eligible for the Kwar Reth class. Those relegated were nicknamed Oror√∏ (\\"son of a crowd of young girls\\").  Chollo (C√∏ll√∏)  This class includes most Shilluk clans and the majority of the Shilluk people. Its members are descendants of the collateral Nyikang (Jur clans, or dh√∏ kal√∏), the descendants of Nyikang's companions in exile (Ab√∂g√∏ clans, M√∂√∂y√∏ or Kwa'jul√∏),or Kwa'J√§ng√∏ the offspring of other peoples who settled in Shilluk country (the Kwa'J√§ng√∏ clan was originally a Dinka clan) and the descendants of the peoples who were settled in Shilluk country before Nyikang's arrival (the Oman clan).Pumphrey 1941, p. 14 Were as Kwa'M√∂√∂y√∏ are originally Nuer descendants in Shilluk (Chollo) Kingdom.  Bang Reth: Bangng R√§dh√∏  The Bang Reth is the class owned by the king. It consists of two groups: the first group includes his royal wives and the widows of dead kings, and the second includes serfs (descendants of slaves captured in raids, or volunteers under the protection of the king because of a violent crime).Pumphrey 1941, pp. 14‚Äì16  Religion and mythology  The river Sobat in South Sudan where the first King Nyikang founded the Shilluk Kingdom. = Lineage of Nyikang = The Shilluk, like other Nilotic peoples, do not give great importance to cosmology. The Shilluk focus on a figure who lived so long ago his life is shrouded in myth: King Nyikang.Graeber 2010, p. 18-21 His origins were considered divine. A white cow named Dean Aduk (Dhyang Adug√∏) bore a gourd. When it was torn, a man named Kolo (K√∂√∂l√∏, P√∂√∂l√∏) arose. Kolo fathered Omaro (Omaar√∏), who fathered Wat Mol (W√§d M√∂√∂l√∏), who fathered Okw√§.Westermann 1912, p. XL Okwa was said to have visited a riverbank and saw two beautiful young women, Nyakayo (Nyikaay√∏) and Ongwak, coming out of the water. They had long hair, and part of their bodies was crocodile-shaped. Okwa grabbed them, and took them him by force; their screams alerted their father, Dunyel Ju'Okwa, who was nearby. Dunyel's was a man on his right side, but a crocodile on his left. After some discussion, Dunyel agreed to give his two daughters to Okwa (Okw√§) at a high bride price. Nyakayo (Nyikaay√∏) Nyikang bore several children; Nyikang was considered by some his eldest son, but according to others he was his youngest son. Another tradition says that Nyikang's twin brother was Duwat (D√Øw√§√§d…î) . A popular belief connects the confluence of the River Sobat and the White Nile with Nyakayo's home.Westermann 1912, p. XLI = Exile = The death of Okwa (Okw√§) began a feud between Nyikang (Nyikaang√∏) and his brother Duwat (D√Øw√§√§d√∏) about monarchical succession. Duwat became king; Nyikang refused to swear allegiance, deciding to move elsewhere with his family. Names vary with versions of the myth, although Omoli Ju (Om√∂√∂li Ju), Ju Nya Okw√§ is commonly named. When Nyikang was leaving, Duwat asked him to look behind him as he threw a long, sharp stick towards his half-brother. With this gesture, Duwat signified that the migrants could never return. However, Nyikang took the stick and used it to plant crops. After many days of travel, the migrant group arrived in a land ruled by Dim (D√Øm√∏), a sorcerer. Nyikang married, and his wife bore him a son named Dak (Daag√∏). The fugitives settled near where the Sobat River flowed into the White Nile, and founded the Shilluk Kingdom.

He served as manager of the Carlow senior inter- county team in the late 1990s while also having spells with the Dunnamaggin, De La Salle and Carrickshock clubs. Fennelly was manager of the Laois senior hurling team from 2010 until 2011. Biography Fennelly was born in Piltown, County Kilkenny to Kevin Fennelly Snr. and the former Teresa Hoyne in 1956. At the age of five, the family moved to Ballyhale where his father purchased a farm. It was here that his interest in hurling was developed in the local national school and in the local club. The Fennellys would go on to become one of the most famous families in Kilkenny hurling history. All seven brothers ‚Äì Brendan, Michael, Ger, Kevin, Liam, Se√°n and Dermot ‚Äì would play for Ballyhale Shamrocks, while many of them would also represent Kilkenny at various levels on the inter-county scene. His nephew, Michael Fennelly, captained Kilkenny to the All-Ireland title in 2009. His daughter, Shauna, is currently studying Nursing in the University of Limerick. Playing career =Club= The Fennelly family have a long association with the famous Ballyhale Shamrocks club. Kevin Fennelly Snr. was instrumental in helping to found the club in 1972. By 1978 the new club had reached the top of the local hurling world and Fennelly was at full-forward as Ballyhale captured their very first senior county title. This victory allowed the Shamrocks club to represent Kilkenny in the provincial club championship. The final of that competition saw Fennelly's side take on Dublin champions Crumlin. A 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì6 victory gave Fennelly his first Leinster club title. The subsequent All-Ireland club final saw Ballyhale Shamrocks take on Cork's famous Blackrock club. A ten-goal thriller saw Blackrock take the title by 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì5. Fennelly added two further county medals to his collection to make it three in-a-row in 1979 and 1980. This latter victory was converted into a Leinster club title following a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì8 victory over Coolderry of Offaly. Once again Ballyhale Shamrocks reached the All-Ireland final where the star-studded St. Finbarr's club from Cork provided the opposition. On that occasion all seven Fennelly brothers lined out in an exciting contest. The sides were level on five occasions during the opening thirty minutes; however, the Shamrocks had the edge. At the full-time whistle Ballyhale were the winners by 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì11 and Fennelly collected his first All-Ireland club winners' medal. Another county championship victory followed for Fennelly in 1982, however, he missed the 1983 county final win due to injury. He was back on the team to collect a second Leinster club title following a six-point victory over Kinnitty of Offaly. Ballyhale later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Galway champions Gort were the opponents. That game ended in 1‚Äì10 apiece draw thanks to a last-minute equalising point by Dermot Fennelly. The replay took place over six weeks later with Ger Fennelly playing a starring role. His first-half goal was the deciding factor as Ballyhale won the day by 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì7. It was Fennelly's second All-Ireland club medal. The rest of the 1980s saw Fennelly bring his county championship tally up to seven with further wins in 1985, 1988 and 1989. The third of these victories was subsequently converted into a fourth Leinster club title following a trouncing of the Cuala club from Dublin. Ballyhale later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Limerick and Munster representatives Ballybrown were the opponents. Ballybrown stormed into a six- point lead in the middle of the first-half before Liam Fennelly scored a goal in the twenty-fourth minute. At half-time Ballybrown still led by four points, however, a surge by Ballyhale saw the Kilkenny side claim a 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì16 victory. It was Fennelly's third All-Ireland winners' medal. Fennelly won his eighth and final county medal with Ballyhale in 1991. He retired from club hurling shortly afterwards. =Inter-county= Fennelly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kilkenny minor hurling team in the early 1970s. He won a Leinster title in that grade in 1974 following an outstanding 8‚Äì19 to 3‚Äì5 victory over Dubln. Kilkenny later faced arch-rivals Cork in the All-Ireland final and a close game developed. At the full-time whistle Fennelly ended up on the losing side by 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì8. It was his last game in the minor grade. Fennelly failed to make an impact on the Kilkenny under-21 team immediately, however, by 1976 he was an integral part of the team. That year he captured a Leinster title in that grade following a 3‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì5 trouncing of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted 'the Cats' against Cork. While Fennelly's side had cause for optimism, Cork ran away with the game and recorded a huge 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì8 victory. Eligible for the under-21 grade again in 1977, Fennelly collected a second consecutive Leinster title after a seven-point defeat of Wexford. Kilkenny again squared off against Cork in the subsequent All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion the game was much closer. After a tense hour of hurling Kilkenny emerged victorious by 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì9 and Febbelly collected an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. Shortly after ending his involvement at under-21 level Fennelly joined the Kilkenny senior hurling team. He was a non-playing substitute as 'the Cats' reached the final of the 1977‚Äì78 National Hurling League. For the third year in succession Clare provided the opposition, however, on this occasion they were the reigning champions. A close game developed, however, at the long whistle Clare were still the champions by 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì10. Fennelly was on and off the Kilkenny team until the early 1980s when a broken leg ended any hope of making the breakthrough at senior level. Management career =Early experience= In retirement from club hurling Fennelly immediately became involved in team management and coaching. In 1994 he was part of the backroom team with the Kilkenny under-21 hurling team. It was a successful move for Fennelly as the team secured the Leinster and All- Ireland titles that year. After moving to Dunnamaggin in the mid-1990s Fennelly quickly got immersed in the local club and helped them to their most successful spell ever as they won three minor county titles, three under-21 county titles and went from junior champions to senior champions in just four years. In 1996 Fennelly ventured into inter-county management for the very first time when he took charge of the Carlow senior hurling team. In 1997 he helped the team to gain promotion from division 2 of the National League, however, a restructuring of the format meant that Carlow were denied the chance to play in the top tier of the league. Fennelly remained with Carlow for a second season, however, he enjoyed little success in 1998. In 1999 Fennelly returned to the Dunnamaggin club who by now were languishing in the intermediate grade. Under Fennelly the club began the climb again, winning the intermediate title in 2000 before getting back to the senior final in 2002. There they were denied by a D. J. Carey-inspired Young Irelands side and a second senior title eluded them. Fennelly then moved to De La Salle in Waterford and although they didn't win anything, he returned a couple of years later to join the backroom team as they won county and Munster titles before falling to Portumna in the All Ireland decider. By 2010 Fennelly was back in Kilkenny and in charge of the Carrickshock club. =Laois= In September 2010 Fennelly was confirmed as the new Laois senior hurling team manager.

Early life and education: 1894‚Äì1925 Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness was born in the farming community of Reynolds, North Dakota on October 18, 1894.Bentley Historical Library, ‚ÄúRudolph H. Gjelsness Papers 1919-1968: Biography‚Äù, University of Michigan, (accessed September 21, 2010). A first-generation American, Gjelsness was raised by his Norwegian immigrant parents Marius and Karoline Gjelsness to speak both the Norwegian and English languages. Gjelsness began his college education at the University of North Dakota and graduated with a degree in zoology and a teacher's certificate in 1916. Following a brief stint as principal of a high school in the small town of Adams, North Dakota, he enrolled in the Library School at the University of Illinois. Shortly thereafter, however, Gjelsness was forced to postpone his education due to the United States' entry into World War I. Following a year of service in the United States Army Air Service in Western Europe, Gjelsness was discharged to serve as a reference librarian at the American Expeditionary Forces University in Beaune, France.David Kaser, ed., Books in America‚Äôs Past: Essays Honoring Rudolph H. Gjelsness (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1966), v. After his time in Europe, Gjelsness returned to the University of Illinois to finish his education, emerging with a bachelor's degree in library science in 1920. This allowed Gjelsness to take a variety of jobs at both public libraries and at major universities. These included positions as head of the Ordering Department at the University of Oregon's library and later as senior bibliographer at the University of California- Berkeley. In 1924, Gjelsness was given an offer to study literature in his parents' homeland by The American-Scandinavian Foundation. Over the course of his year at the University of Oslo, he translated numerous works from Norwegian into English. His experiences were detailed in \\"A Librarian's Year in Norway,\\" an article he contributed to the July 1925 issue of Public Libraries. Professional career: 1925‚Äì1964 Upon his return to the United States, Gjelsness took a job in the University of Michigan Library, where he spent four years principally in the cataloging department. In 1929, he left the university and moved to New York City. Here, he divided his time between heading the preparation division of the New York City Public Library and the Library Science department at Columbia University, where he served as a lecturer. While living in New York, Gjelsness married Ruth Weaver. The couple later had two children, Elizabeth and Barent. Also while in New York, Gjelsness also became active in the American Library Association and served on various high-profile committees within the organization. These included the Committee on Cataloging and Classification, the American Agricultural Libraries Section, and the International Relations Board.Kaser, Books in America‚Äôs Past, vi. He was also the group's treasurer between 1941 and 1947.ALA World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services, 2nd ed., s.v. ‚ÄúGjelsness, Rudolph H.‚Äù Among Gjelsness's achievements with the ALA was his work as editor-in-chief revising the standard Anglo-American Cataloging Rules between 1935 and 1941 and the subsequent publication of ALA Catalog Rules: Author and Title Entries in 1941. After a brief stint back at the University of Michigan, Gjelsness took a job heading the Special Collections Division at the University of Arizona while concurrently lecturing at the University of Illinois and serving as a consultant at Vanderbilt University. In 1937, he again left Arizona to return to the University of Michigan. After serving three years as a professor, he was promoted to Dean of the Library Science Department 1940, a position he held until 1964. Although he taught many courses at the university, his primary interest was in the history of American publishing of both books and periodicals.Kaser, Books in America‚Äôs Past, vii. He also briefly served as the president of the Association of American Library Schools between 1948 and 1949. During his tenure as dean, he also began to aid in the establishment and progress of libraries and library science department in foreign countries. Among these were a program he helped set up in Bogota, Colombia, and Mexico City's Benjamin Franklin Library, where he served as director between 1943 and 1944. Gjelsness later returned to Mexico, resulting in the publication of one of his major works, The American Book in Mexico: A Bibliography of Books by Authors of the United States of America Published in Mexico, 1952-55. For this project, Gjelsness compiled and sorted a list of books written by Americans that were published and sold in Mexico, as well as wrote an introduction regarding publishing and readership in Mexico.Rudolph Gjelsness, The American Book in Mexico: A Bibliography of Books by Authors of the United States of America Published in Mexico 1952-55 (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Department of Library Science: 1957). In October 1962, he went to Iraq to act as consultant to the President of the University of Baghdad, as part of a Ford Foundation project to develop the University‚Äôs libraries. However, he never managed to establish a relationship with the President, and seems to have done little other than organise some training on cataloguing and classification for 5 of the Central Library‚Äôs staff over a 2-month period in 1963. His appointment was for 2 years, but he had taken sabbatical leave only for a year, and his departure surprised the Foundation. Gjelsness also contributed many articles to various scholarly journals on a variety of topics regarding libraries and the role of library schools. During his tenure as dean at the University of Michigan, Gjelsness observed in one such article originally published in 1945 that library science departments were improving but more still needed to be done to attract better candidates to careers in the field. He recommended increases in salaries to remedy the situation, putting the minimum figure at three thousand dollars per year.Rudolph H. Gjelsness, \\"Library Schools Make Progress,\\" Library Journal 116, no. 11 (June 15, 1991): S31. Retirement and death: 1964‚Äì1968 In 1964, Gjelsness retired from the University of Michigan. Still, he continued to serve the library profession, including a return to the University of Arizona's Special Collections Division. His final appointment sent him to San Juan, Puerto Rico where he was hired to assist in the foundation of the University of Puerto Rico's Library Science Department. However, the day after his arrival, Gjelsness was killed in a hit-and-run traffic accident on August 16, 1968.

It refers to a series of political purges in the late 15th and 16th centuries, in which Sarim scholars suffered persecution at the hands of their political rivals. The politics of the Middle Joseon Dynasty were primarily marked by a power struggle between two social groups among the yangban aristocracy. People in place were the 'Meritorious Subjects', rewarded for helping the establishment of Joseon against the former Goryeo, and subsequent accomplishments. Referred as the Hungu faction (Hungupa, ÌõàÍµ¨Ìåå, Âã≥ËàäÊ¥æ), they held the key positions in the State Council and the Six Ministries that carried out state affairs. The newcomers were the so-called Sarim (Sarimpa, ÏÇ¨Î¶ºÌåå, Â£´ÊûóÊ¥æ), who belonged to the neo- Confucian school of Kim Jong-jik and other thinkers. The Sarim scholars generally shunned the royal court and studied neo-Confucianism in rural provinces, especially after King Sejo's usurpation of the throne in 1455. During the reign of King Seongjong, Sarim scholars started to occupy key positions in what was known as the \\"Three Offices\\" (Samsa, ÏÇºÏÇ¨), the collective name for three government watchdog organizations: the Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu, ÏÇ¨ÌóåÎ∂Ä, Âè∏ÊÜ≤Â∫ú), whose main role was to impeach government officials for corrupt or improper actions; the Office of Censors (Saganwon, ÏÇ¨Í∞ÑÏõê, Âè∏Ë´´Èô¢), whose function to criticize the improper actions and policies of the king and ministers; and the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan, ÌôçÎ¨∏Í¥Ä, ÂºòÊñáÈ§®) who oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king's questions. Using the Samsa as a stronghold, the Sarim scholars challenged the power of the central government and the Hungu faction as a whole, impeaching them for alleged corruption or impropriety. The subsequent conflict between these two factions resulted in violent purges (1498, 1504, 1519, 1545), having a specific pattern among the political purges that occurred in Joseon from 1453 to 1722 (whose traditional number is twelve for the period 1453-1722). While the Sarim faction lost each of the four confrontations, their moral influence keep ever increasing and finally they evinced the former Hungu faction. First literati purge of 1498 The first and second literati purges took place during the reign of Yeonsangun, successor to Seongjong. The First Literati Purge of 1498, also called Muo Sahwa (Î¨¥Ïò§ÏÇ¨Ìôî, ÊàäÂçàÂ£´Á¶ç/ÊàäÂçàÂè≤Á¶ç), began as the personal grudge of Yi Guk-don against Kim Il-son, who once impeached him. Both were assigned to compile records related to King Seongjong's reign for Annals of Joseon Dynasty, and Kim Il-son, a disciple of Kim Jong-jik, included the latter's writing that was critical of King Sejo's usurpation in the compilation. (Kim Jong-jik wrote a lamentation of Xiang Yu's murder of Emperor Yi of Chu in early Chinese history after he heard of Danjong's death at the order of King Sejo.) When Yi Guk-don, Kim Il-son's superior, found this out, he sensed a chance of revenge. Kim Il- son and other followers of Kim Jong-jik were accused of treason by the Hungu faction, many of whom originally gained power from their support of Sejo. Because Yeonsangun's lineage came from Sejo, Sarim faction's view of Sejo's usurpation was considered to be treasonable. Yeonsangun - who disliked academia and was notorious for turning the Seonggyungwan, royal study hall, into his personal brothel - found an opportunity to purge the Sarim scholars and weaken Three Offices. Kim Il-son and two others were \\"drawn and quartered\\" (each limb was pulled apart by ox) while three were beheaded. Kim Jong-jik's remains were excavated and then beheaded, and at least 18 others were exiled. Yeonsangun ordered the entire court officials to watch Kim's execution and even ordered that those who did not attend or turned face away be reported so that they might be punished.  Second literati purge of 1504  The Second Literati Purge of 1504, or Kapcha Sahwa (Í∞ëÏûêÏÇ¨Ìôî, Áî≤Â≠êÂ£´Á¶ç), followed when Yeonsangun eventually discovered that his real mother was not Queen Jung-hyeon but Deposed Queen Yun, who had been executed (by poison) in 1482 for poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines and scratching Seongjong's face. Yeonsangun was told about his mother's death and presented with a piece of clothing purportedly stained with her vomited blood. He responded by killing two of Seongjong's concubines, and ordering the execution of officials who had supported Yun's death. This event struck both the Hungu and the remnants of Sarim factions indiscriminately, including the instigators of the first purge. At least 36 officials were executed (by drinking poison) and the remains of eight deceased officials were mutilated. The actual death toll was much greater than 36, because the victims' families and relatives were punished as well - male members being killed and the female members enslaved. A total of 239 officials were either executed, exiled, or dismissed. Yeonsangun was eventually deposed by the remaining Hungu officials, and his half-brother Jungjong became the eleventh king of Joseon in 1506. Third literati purge of 1519 Jo Gwang-jo The Third Literati Purge of 1519, also called Kimyo Sahwa or Gimyo Sahwa (Í∏∞Î¨òÏÇ¨Ìôî, Â∑±ÂçØÂ£´Á¶ç), is one of the most discussed literati purges in Joseon Dynasty because the Sarim faction held political power and was in the process of carrying out significant reforms at the time of their purge. Jungjong worked to remove excesses of Yeonsangun and return to Seongjong's era, but his royal authority was limited due to powerful presence of coup leaders who put him on the throne. Only when the three main leaders of coup died of old age and natural causes eight years later, Jungjong began to assert his authority and look for ways to restrain Hungu faction's power. He soon found an answer in Jo Gwang-jo, a young and energetic leader of the Sarim faction, who soon became Jungjong's most trusted official. He enjoyed such a complete confidence of Jungjong that Jungjong abandoned a planned war at the sole opposition by Jo. With Jungjong's support, Jo rose to become an Inspector General only four years after entering politics in a series of unprecedented promotions and brought in many like-minded, young Sarim scholars from rural provinces to Jungjong's court. Under his leadership, the Sarim faction pushed forth a series of reforms as they established local self-government system called Hyang'yak, pursued land reforms to distribute land more equally and limit amount of land owned by the rich, promulgated Confucian beliefs widely among the public with vernacular translations, and sought to reduce the number of slaves. Yi Duk Il, \\"Seonbi Image Demanded by 21st Century,\\" (in Korean) Jo believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. (For instance, he met a nameless butcher/tanner of lowest class and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a government official.) According to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, Annals of Joseon Dynasty, October, 1520 no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace or local provinces during this time because of strict enforcement by Inspector General's Office. He was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, \\"Our master is coming,\\" according to famous Korean philosopher Yi I. However, these radical reforms generated fierce hostility and resistance of the Hungu faction. Jo also made many political enemies by impeaching many of the so-called heroes of 1506 coup. Especially when Jo argued that many of the alleged contributors to 1506 coup did not actually contribute to the coup and revoked their special privileges (including tax exemptions and huge stipends), the Hungu faction began to plot Jo's downfall. In early 1519, there was a plot by some Hungu officials to assassinate Sarim officials, which was discovered in time. =\\"Jo will become king\\"= Jo's uncompromising character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs also began to irritate the king. Furthermore, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hungu faction leader Hong Kyung-ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. At the behest of Hong Kyung-ju, Minister of Rites Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, and other Hungu leaders, they told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwang-jo who ruled the country and that people wanted to make him their king. Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said. According to Annals of Joseon Dynasty, Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase \\"Ju cho will become the king\\" (Ï£ºÏ¥àÏúÑÏôï, Ëµ∞ËÇñÁà≤Áéã)\\" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves.Annals, September 21, 1568 When two Hanja (Chinese) characters \\"ju\\"(Ëµ∞) and \\"cho\\"(ËÇñ) are put together, they form a new Hanja character \\"jo\\"(Ë∂ô), which happens to be Jo Gwang-jo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'√©tat, began to distrust Jo Gwang- jo. [When Goryeo dynasty fell and was replaced by Joseon dynasty, there was popular saying \\"Son of wood will gain the country\\" (Î™©ÏûêÎìùÍµ≠ Êú®Â≠êÂæóÂúã). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(Êú®) and son(Â≠ê) are combined, they form a new character \\"yi\\"(Êùé), which happens to be the family name of Yi Seong-gye, who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty. These phrases helped Yi Seong- gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.] Now feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. When Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened. Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwang-jo would next go on to question legitimacy of the coup and then turn against him.Annals, April 13, 1520 Jungjong instructed Hungu leaders to kill Jo Gwang-jo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hungu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents.Annals, November 15, 1519 Inspector Jo Gwang-jo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation.Annals, December 21, 1544 The whole event had appearance of coup d'√©tat except that it was sanctioned by the king. =\\"What is their crime?\\"= They would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwang-jo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to execute him.Annals, November 16, 1519, No. 12 They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pil, who often clashed with Jo and was even approached by Nam Gon for support,Annals, January 16, 1535, No.4 entreated in tears: \\"I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king (Yeonsangun), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?\\" Chief Council and Six Ministries jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charge without evidence would be a blot on the king's reputation.Annals, November 16, 1519, No.20 Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwang-jo.Annals, November 16, 1519, No.7 Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was \\"deeply moved\\" by Jo's loyalty.Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12 New Inspector General Yu Eun protested in even stronger terms: \\"If Jo Gwang-jo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner ... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment after secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few seonbis with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so secretly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with your subjects on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind.\\"Annals, November 18, 1519 Meanwhile, 150 Seonggyungwan students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties,Annals, November 16, 1519, No.13 and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together.Annals, November 17, 1519 Such outpouring in Jo's support may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger. Later Chief State Councillor Jeong, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon were removed from office for opposing Jo's execution., Reformer Jo Kwang-jo (in Korean) =Purge of Sarim scholars= Jo Gwang-jo was completely caught off guard by the turn of the event. The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days earlier when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by wicked Hungu ministers and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation. He wrote to Jungjong of his fear of this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience.Annals, November 16, 1915, No.11 However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again. Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwang-jo was exiled to Neung-ju. But less than a month later, Jungjong fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf and reinstated Jo's death sentence by poison. Before drinking poison, Jo wrote a death poem declaring his loyalty and bowed four times toward the palace.Annals, December 16, 1519 Later when there was a severe drought in the country, people believed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent seonbi. Kim Jung and three others were executed as well in 1520, and dozens of Sarim scholars were exiled. Many others left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. In 1521, Ahn Dang's son allegedly plotted to assassinate Nam Gon and Shim Jung, for which a dozen people including Ahn Dang were executed. In all, 225 officials were affected by the purge. Most of Jo's reforms were rescinded with his fall. In the end, Jungjong abruptly abandoned his reformist agenda because he either lost confidence in Jo Gwango-jo's programs or feared that he would become too powerful in the future. While Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared the reformist agenda, Jungjong was also chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, in which the king must be governed and restricted by teachings of Confucius and Mencius. The Third Literati Purge of 1519 was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to fulfill ideal neo-Confucian society by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family. Later its victims, called Gimyo Sarim or \\"Wise men of Gimyo,\\" were venerated as Confucian martyrs while instigators became symbols of wickedness for many generations (For instance, fermented fish of lowest quality is still called Gonjangyi, combined word from Nam Gon and Shim Jung's given names). Nam Gon, one of main instigators who fabricated the conspiracy, regretted his role in the purge late in his life and willed that all his writings be burnt. No writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was a famous writer. Fourth literati purge of 1545 When Jungjong died in 1544 and the crown prince Injong became the twelfth king, Sarim's hopes proved to be true. He appointed Yi Eonjeok and other famous Sarim scholars to high positions and rehabilitated Jo Gwang-jo and other purge victims. Unfortunately for the Sarim faction, Injong's reign was also to be the shortest of Joseon kings. When Injong died eight months later and Myeongjong became the thirteenth king of Joseon at the age of twelve, his mother Queen Munjeong became the regent and her brother Yoon Won Hyung wielded enormous power. (Many in the Sarim faction believed that Injong was poisoned by Queen Munjeong, but there is no evidence that this was the case.) Lesser Yoon faction was not persecuted by Greater Yoon faction during Injong's reign, but Injong dismissed Yoon Won-hyung and Yoon Won-ro from their positions after they were impeached by the Greater Yoon faction. Now that he was reinstated, Yoon Wong-hyung accused Yoon Im and his supporters of plotting to put another prince instead of Myeongjong on the throne after Injong's death. This ploy at first backfired and led to his exile, but continued accusations and rumors of Yoon Im's treason led to the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, in which the prince, Yoon Im, and nine of his supporters including Sarim scholars were executed. After this initial purge, Yoon Won-hyung continued to purge his rivals and Sarim scholars over next five years until the total death toll surpassed one hundred and many others including Yi Eonjeok were exiled. Yoon Won-hyung even killed his older brother Yoon Won-ro in the ensuing power struggle. After Queen Munjeong's death in 1565, Myeongjong exiled Yoon Won- hyung, who died or committed suicide the same year, and attempted to govern well by recruiting talented people but died two years later. Along with Kim Anro, Yoon Won-hyung is considered one of the worst politicians of Joseon dynasty. =Power struggle of in-laws= Unlike other literati purges, the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, or Ulsa Sahwa (ÏùÑÏÇ¨ÏÇ¨Ìôî, ‰πôÂ∑≥Â£´Á¶ç), was largely a result of power struggle between relatives of the competing princes. After Jo Gwang-jo's fall, Nam Gon and Shim Jung's faction and Kim Anro's faction vied for power after Kim Anro's son married Jungjong's eldest daughter. Kim Anro was exiled by Nam Gon and Shim Jung for abusing power, but he returned from exile after Nam Gon's death and successfully drove out Shim Jung, who was accused of accepting bribes from Consort Park to help her put her son on the throne instead of crown prince. Later he framed Shim Jung and Consort Park on the charge of cursing the crown prince (A dead rat whose mouth, eyes, and ears were burnt with hot iron to make it look like a pig was discovered hanging from a tree in the crown prince's palace on his birthday. There also phrases cursing the crown prince, whose Chinese zodiac sign was Pig. Consort Park was suspected for she was already known to be plotting to put her son on the throne instead. It was later found out to be Kim Anro's doing after his fall.) Consort Park, her son Prince Buksong, and Shim Jung were executed. Kim Anro now unleashed the reign of terror against his political enemies in the name of protecting the crown prince. He even attempted to depose Queen Munjeong, who gave birth to a son who was later to become Myeongjong, but this led to his downfall and execution in 1537. After Kim Anro's fall, the crown prince Injong's maternal uncle Yoon Im and Queen Munjeong's brothers Yoon Won-ro and Yoon Won-hyung filled the power vacuum. (Yoon Im and Yoon Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yoon Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yoon Brothers' great-great-grandfather.) Many officials gathered around the two centers of power and developed into separate political factions. Yoon Im's faction became known as ‚ÄòGreater Yoon‚Äô and the Yoon brothers' faction as ‚ÄòLesser Yoon.‚Äô By then, Jungjong promoted Sarim scholars again by recalling them from exile and reappointing to court positions to restrain Hungu faction's power. Many Sarim scholars joined the Greater Yoon since they had great hopes for the crown prince, who studied under Jo Gwang-jo and Yi Hwang and was greatly anticipated to become a benevolent ruler. Aftermath These four purges decimated the Sarim faction and again drove them to the rural villages, where they built schools (called seowon). Yi Hwang, for example, left politics in the aftermath of the Fourth Literati Purge and did not return to the court despite repeated summons by Myeongjong. Other famous philosophers Jo Shik, Seo Gyeong-deok, and Seoung Soo-chim also turned away from politics after Jo Gwang-jo's death. Jo Shik turned down his appointment by writing to Myeongjong: \\"Under Your Majesty's reign, state of affairs has already gone awry and the foundation of the country has already collapsed. Heaven's will has already left as did the support of people... The Queen Regent is thoughtful, but she is merely a widow deep inside palace, and Your Majesty is young and thus merely a lonely heir to the late king. Therefore, how would one handle thousands of natural disasters and billion pieces of people's heart?\\"Annals, November 19, 1555 (In Joseon Dynasty, natural disasters were thought to occur due to king's fault.) However, the Sarim continued to thrive in rural provinces through its seowons and Hyang'yak system. By the reign of King Seonjo, successor to Myeongjong, the Sarim faction gained the control of the central government and dominated Joseon politics ever since. Modern reinterpretation The above account of literati purges is based on widely accepted traditional understanding of the subject, which largely stems from the Sarim faction's point of view. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty and much of what we know about these events were largely written by Sarim scholars even before they emerged as the eventual victor. Some historians have tried to reinterpret the literati purges as a result of struggle between the Joseon kings who wanted to establish absolute monarchy and the aristocrats who claimed that the true loyalty to king was to guide him to become a benevolent Confucian philosopher-king by pointing out his mistakes if necessary. The Sarim scholars tended to occupy key positions in Three Offices, which put them in conflict with the king and high-ranking ministers. In this view, the distinction between Sarim and Hungu factions are thought to be largely artificial, and division within aristocracy was largely along the family connections rather than philosophical differences. Other purges Following the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, there were a series of other similar purges out of political struggle between different factions, but they are not called \\"literati purges,\\" or sahwa (ÏÇ¨Ìôî) in Korean, which specifically refers to persecution of Sarim scholars by the Hungu faction in late 15th and early 16th century. The later purges are instead called with various names such as oksa (meaning treason case), muok(false treason case), hwanguk (change of power), and bakhae (persecution, especially of those Catholic faith in the 19th century). One notable example of the later purges is Treason Case of 1589, or Gichuk Oksa, which is sometimes called the fifth literati purge even though both the instigators and victims were of Sarim faction. In these later purges, the victimized faction would call the event \\"literati purge (sahwa)\\" to signify their innocence and the rival faction's wrongs. *Oksa (Treason Case) **Shinsa Muok (Ïã†ÏÇ¨Î¨¥Ïò•) or False Treason Case of 1521 - Three years after the Third Literati Purge of 1519, Jo Gwang-jo's supporters were accused of plotting to assassinate Nam Gon and Shim Jeong and were executed. It is more often considered a part of Third Literati Purge (Jungjong). **Gichuk Oksa (Í∏∞Ï∂ïÏò•ÏÇ¨) or Treason Case of 1589 - the bloodiest purge in Joseon history, in which the Western faction purged the rival Eastern faction. 1,000 people were executed or exiled (Seonjo). **Gyechuk Oksa (Í≥ÑÏ∂ïÏò•ÏÇ¨) or Treason Case of 1613 - After Gwanghaegun rose to the throne, Greater Northern faction accused Lesser Northern faction of plotting to dethrone Gwanghaegun and make his half-brother the king. (The excesses of Greater Northern faction led to the coup d'√©tat in which the Westerners and Southerners placed Injo on the throne.) **Shinyim Oksa (Ïã†ÏûÑÏò•ÏÇ¨) or Treason Cases of 1721 and 1722 - Leaders of Noron faction (split from Western faction) who supported Yeonyingun (later Yeongjo) advocated regency of Yeoningun in place of sickly Gyeongjong. They were accused of disloyalty, and four of them were executed in 1721. In 1722, Soron and Namin factions accused Noron faction of plotting to kill Gyeongjong, and eight leaders who had again advocated Yeonyingun's regency were executed. **Eulhae Oksa (ÏùÑÌï¥Ïò•ÏÇ¨) or Treason Case of 1755 - After Yeonyingun rose to the throne and became Yeongjo, Soron faction was driven out of power in reaction to Shinyim Oksa. Five Soron members were accused of treason and were executed. *Hwanguk (Turn of state) - Purges in Sukjong's reign is called hwanguk, meaning sudden change of government. They marked the reemergence of earlier purges after a century of peaceful rivalry between Southern and Western factions. **Gyeonshin Hwanguk (Í≤ΩÏã†ÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1680 - Two leaders of Southern faction was accused of plotting to dethrone Sukjong by the Western faction (Sukjong). **Gisa Hwanguk (Í∏∞ÏÇ¨ÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1689 - The Western faction fell out of power after opposing the naming of crown prince. Song Siyeol and others were executed. (Sukjong) **Gaapsul Hwanguk (Í∞ëÏà†ÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1694 - The Southern faction's attempt to purge Western faction on charge of plotting to reinstate deposed Queen Inhyeon backfires. The Southern faction would never recover from this purge politically. However, the Westerners already split into Noron and Soron factions. (Sukjong) **Shinchuk Hwanguk (Ïã†Ï∂ïÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1721 - Noron faction loses power in the aftermath of Shinyim Oksa. (Gyeongjong) **Eulsa Hwanguk (ÏùÑÏÇ¨ÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1725 - Yeongjo becomes the king, and Noron faction regains power. **Jeongmi Hwanguk (Ï†ïÎØ∏ÌôòÍµ≠) or Turn of 1727 - Yeongjo replaces hardliners with moderates from both Noron and Soron faction. *Bakhae (Persecution) - They were also called Saok(ÏÇ¨Ïò•), meaning \\"Heresy Case\\". **Sinhae Bakhae (Ïã†Ìï¥Î∞ïÌï¥) or Persecution of 1781 - First persecution of Catholicism in Korea. Noron's Byeokpa faction advocated persecution while Shipa faction opposed it. Two Catholics were executed, but persecution was limited after Jeongjo adopted Shipa faction's policy. **Shinyu Bakhae (Ïã†Ïú†Î∞ïÌï¥) or Persecution of 1801 - After Jeongjo's death, Queen Jeongsun and conservative Byoekpa faction reversed many of Jeongjo's reforms and carried out the worst persecution of the Joseon Catholics, which was also aimed at the purge of liberal Shipa and Southern factions, some of whose leaders including Jeong Yak-yong were Catholics or had Catholic relatives. 300 people were executed, and Jeong Yak-yong was exiled. (Sunjo) **Gihae Bakhae (Í∏∞Ìï¥Î∞ïÌï¥) or Persecution of 1839 - There was no persecution while Shipa was in power, but Byeoka regained power and resumed the persecution of Catholics by executing 119 people. (Heonjong) Depictions in Korean mass media The Korean literati purges are frequently depicted in Korean television dramas and movies. In Dae Jang Geum, main protagonist Jang Guem's father is a victim of the second literati purge. Jang Geum herself and her mentor Lady Han are framed in connection with the third literati purge while the male protagonist Min Jung Ho is portrayed as a follower of Jo Gwang-jo. In television drama Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin (2004-5), Yi Sun-shin's grandfather is depicted as a victim of third literati purge and Yi's father is arrested while paying respect to Jo Gwang-jo's spirit at Jo's abandoned house. the second literati purge is dramatized through the movie, \\"The Treacherous\\" (2015). The third and fourth literati purges also constitute main plot lines of the 2001 television drama \\"Ladies of the Palace\\". The first and second literati purges are depicted in television dramas \\"King and Queen\\" (1998‚Äì2000) \\"The King and I\\" (2007‚Äì2008), \\"Queen Insoo \\" (2011) \\" and 2005 film The King and the Clown.

In 1528, on the death of his father Connor was inaugurated King of Thomond and having reigned for 12 years he died in 1540. His eldest son Donough was a minor when his father died and Connor's brother Murrough gained the estates and title of King of Thomond under tanistry, or popular election (then in general use, but abolished by King James in 1605) whereby the estate and title were to descend, for life, to the eldest and worthiest man of the blood and name of him that died last. Both parties appealed to Henry VIII and it was agreed that Murrough would become the 1st Earl of Thomond and upon his death the title would pass to Donough, on condition that both men recognised Henry as their lawful king, that they would give up their claims to be King of Thomond and that they would become Anglican. This arrangement was agreed, and with the death of Murrough the title of Earl passed to Donough. However, on the death of Donough in 1551, the rights of his son, Connor, 3rd Earl of Thomond, to the title and estates was challenged by Donnell, his uncle and a brother of his father, who was inaugurated O'Brien and chief of the Dal Cais.

The languages of instruction are in English and French. Lambda was inaugurated on 10 October 2008 by the mayoress of Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Madame Monique Worth and appointed representatives from the Chinese Embassy, Ottawa. The name Lambda was specifically chosen for a variety of reasons. In physics, the sign Lambda (uppercase Œõ, lowercase Œª) stands for wavelength. Through the wavelength of sounds, humans communicate through music. Through the wavelength of light, we communicate emotions through various colors in painting. Lambda is also the acronym for Learning of the Arts through the Mind and Body in the Discovery of Aesthetics. Lambda School supports other organizations of the arts and education in Quebec. The school has been a sponsor of scholarships for the Montreal Classical Music Festival organized annually by the Quebec Music Teachers' Association as well as the Lakeshore Chamber Music Society, and the Quebec Music Competition while also offering an array of scholarships and bursaries to deserving students of the arts. To encourage the development of high level performance in young musicians and to promote the spirit of transcending one's artistic boundaries Lambda School also supports the Quebec Music Competition, an annual music competition organized by the Concours International de Musique et des Beaux Arts de Quebec, offering various scholarships, prizes, certificates and perpetual trophies, and performance opportunities for winners. Lambda school also offers free programs to the community and senior citizens. It is also the official examination centre for RCM Examinations of practice and theoretical subjects in the West Island of Montreal since January 2011. In 2015, Lambda has also set up an auxiliary school in Shanghai, China. Curriculum The school provides a comprehensive education to learners of all ages and levels. Founded and conceived as a school of interdisciplinary learning of the arts with the intent of helping learners discover their artistic niche, it offers a variety of artistic disciplines. Subjects offered include music, musical theatre, dance, painting, photography and videography. Lambda is headed by a panel of academic advisors that includes university professors, experts, and researchers in education and psychology, as well as a team of artists-in- residence. Lambda offers artistic education from the beginners' level to concert artist level. Without a pre-auditioning process, students who are dedicated yet have not attained a significant level of accomplishment at an early age are able to receive artistic education from international concert artists to reach their full artistic potential. Artists-in-residence at Lambda School include international concert artists such as concert violinist Alexandre Da Costa, pipa and guzheng performer Liu Fang, operatic baritone Jorge Chamine, and Montreal-Korean concert pianist Wonny Song who also serves as associate director and director of artists-in-residence. Lambda's faculty consists of concert artists including graduates from prestigious institutions such as the Juilliard School of Music, Manhattan School of Music, Eastman School of Music, Curtis Institute of Music, University of Montreal, McGill University, The Glenn Gould School and other major universities and conservatories. In 2015, Lambda also set up a special interdisciplinary exploratory program, with the purpose of introducing young learners to music, arts, science and technology through an integrated and hands-on experience. Besides regular training programs in music and fine arts, Lambda School also offers a fast-track program to young students who wish to pursuit a musical career from an early age. Many outstanding performers have emerged from this fast-track program. Lambda also offers an intense summer day camp for Canadian as well as international students who wish to perfect their musical skills in piano and strings. Lambda School of Music and Fine Arts started its division of online music instruction as a result of COVID-19.  Student and alumni achievements  Lambda School has consistently groomed a significant number of musical prodigies. A large number of music students of Lambda have been awarded major prizes in national and international competitions. Performances by Lambda students have also been featured on PBS Mountain Lake television, Global TV, CBC Radio Canada and Breakfast TV. Many students from Lambda won first prizes at the Canadian Music Competition (CMC), Crescendo International Competition, the Elite International Competition, Golden Classical Music Award Competition, the Grand Prize Virtuoso International Competition, the Quebec Music Competition, The Shanghai International Music Competition. Students have been invited to perform at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Der Musikverein in Vienna, Parco della Musica in Italy (Rome) as well as Carnegie Hall in New York numerous times, as well as major concert halls in Amsterdam, Brussels, Luxumberg, China, and other countries.

The Manaia is usually depicted as having the head of a bird and the tail of a fish and the body of a man, though it is sometimes depicted as a bird, a serpent, or a human figure in profile. Other interpretations include a seahorse and a lizard. The word manaia is cognate with the founding Samoan term fa'amanaia, and relevant to the Niuean fakamanaia, both meaning to make a decoration or embellishment.www.maori.info Manaia page The Manaia is traditionally believed to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits, and its symbol is used as a guardian against evil.Bone Art Place In this form, it is usually represented in a figure-of-eight shape, the upper half culminating in a bird-like beak. This form was also widely used in designs of door and window lintels and other architectural features, as well as in ceremonial hafts of weapons.Te Rangi Hiroa (1950) The Coming of the Maori at The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre A study of MƒÅori carving suggests that every naturalistic figure there is an equivalent Manaia form which can be seen as a distorted profile-face version of the equivalent full- face figure. It may be that the Manaia represents some spiritual or inner facet of the full face figure. Related Manaia-like symbols are also found in other Polynesian cultures, such as in Hawaii and Easter Island. The manaia is a useful motif in carving, as it can be distorted to fit any shape and blended into many different designs. As such, it can be used to fill the empty spaces in wood carving, and in many compositions the background between the main figures is filled in with Manaia. It is a very common form in Maori jewellery (possibly only less common than the hei-tiki and hei matau), and is often found worn as a pendant carved from bone or greenstone.

Its membership comprised the leaders of the various federal states established by the Dutch in the areas they occupied following their attack on the areas of Indonesia controlled by republican forces during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). It took part in negotiations with the Dutch in August and September 1948, and participated in the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference at which the Dutch agreed to hand over sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia. Background On 9 March 1948, Acting Governor- General of the Dutch East Indies Hubertus van Mook established a Provisional Federal Government, which was essentially the same as the colonial government, with substantial powers remaining in the hands of the Dutch. A conference was organized in Bandung for representatives of the federal states to discuss issues related to the form of government of the future federal state and its relationship with the Netherlands. The Dutch also hoped that the presence of high-profile non-republican figures would provide political support. The Bandung Conference was opened by van Mook on 27 May. According to Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, he had the idea of establishing a body from among the delegates at the conference to represent the federal states as a response to these efforts by van Mook to establish a state on terms favourable to the Dutch. Together with Adil Poeadiredja, Prime Minister of the State of Pasundan, he invited the leaders of 13 states and regions together with observers from a further three - all outside the area controlled by republican forces - to a meeting in Bandung on 8 July 1948. The aim of the conference was to break the deadlock with the Dutch and identify a solution to the \\"Indonesian problem\\". After five days of discussions, the delegates agreed on an outline for an interim federal government, and resolved that their proposal, which became known as the \\"Bandung Resolution\\", would be conveyed to van Mook, the Dutch government and the Republican government in Yogyakarta. These delegates then named themselves the Federal Consultative Assembly (BFO). Each region represented in it had one vote, regardless of size. Dutch response to the Bandung Resolution In July, a BFO delegation led by chairman T. Bahrioen from East Sumatra, delivered the \\"Bandung Resolution\\" to Van Mook. As the Dutch had assumed that the federal leaders would agree with the Dutch proposals, rather than taking the initiative, this came as a shock, and van Mook expressed considerable displeasure. However, a BFO delegation was invited to the Hague for discussions with the Dutch government. The Dutch subsequently put forward a counter-proposal that would have meant the Dutch government representative during the transition to the United States of Indonesia would have retained extensive authority. This was unanimously rejected by the BFO. More consultation followed, and on 14 December 1948, the Dutch government issued an Indonesian Interim Period Administrative Ordnance (), known as the BIO Decree, which laid down the form of the interim administration and the procedure for the establishment of the United States of Indonesia. However, despite the consultations, the content of this decree contained very little of the BFO proposal. It gave the Dutch a veto on actions by the Indonesian administration, as well as \\"absolute and unrestricted power\\" to decide on the final form of the federal Indonesian state. Inter-Indonesian Conferences On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched a \\"police action\\" known as Operation Kraai to regain control over those areas still controlled by republican forces. Despite the military success, including the capture of Yogyakarta, it triggered worldwide condemnation, and the Dutch were pressured to negotiate with the republicans. This led to the 7 May 1949 Roem‚Äìvan Roijen Agreement, at which the republicans agreed to join the BFO at the Round Table Conference in the Hague at which the Dutch would hand over power to the United States of Indonesia. Before this agreement was reached, Anak Agung proposed a pan- Indonesia conference so the federalists and republicans could agree a common position on the eventual outcome of the Round Table Conference, independently of the Dutch. Given the moral and political dominance of the republicans, the first of these conferences was held in from 19‚Äì22 July in the republican capital Yogyakarta, rather than Batavia and the pro-federal Anak Agung had wanted. The second took place in Batavia from 20 July-2 August. Among the points agreed were: * sovereignty would be handed over to the United States of Indonesia from both the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia * in the 150-seat USI House of Representatives, the BFO states would have 100 seats, and the Republic of Indonesia 50 * in the 32-seat Senate, the BFO states would have 32 seats, and the Republic of Indonesia two * the USI army would be formed exclusively from the Indonesian Republican Army * Sukarno would be president, while Mohammad Hatta would be prime minister Round Table Conference and afterwards The BFO delegation at the Round Table Conference was led by Syarif Hamid II of Pontianak, while the Indonesian republican delegation was headed by Mohammad Hatta. Because of the inter-Indonesia conferences, the two Indonesian delegates showed a united front. Talks began on 23 August 1949, and led to agreement for the \\"unconditional and complete transfer of sovereignty\\" of the former Dutch East Indies (Except for Western New Guinea) to the United States of Indonesia. Following ratification of the agreement by the Indonesian republican provisional legislature, the Central Indonesian National Committee, the 15 federal states and the Dutch parliament, sovereignty was transferred to the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949. The nation's first Republic of the United States of Indonesia Cabinet was dominated by men from the Republic of Indonesia, which was now one part of the USI. Only five of the 16 ministers were from BFO states, and of these, only two, Anak Agung and Sultan Hamid II, were supporters of the federal state. With less of a role to play now the state had been established, the authority of BFO was now in decline. In the first few months of 1950, most of the components of the USI dissolved themselves into the Republic of Indonesia, and on 17 August 1950, the federal state was replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia.

The microphone won a TEC Award in 1996 for outstanding microphone technology. Shure's Beta series of microphones was introduced in 1989. Originally the Beta 58 was available as the Beta 58C (chrome grill) or the Beta 58M (matte grill). The Beta 58C was eventually discontinued and the Beta 58M became just the Beta 58. The Beta 58 was then discontinued and replaced by the Beta 58A.https://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/441/kw/57%20and%2058%20Comparison Development In 1996, Shure altered the Beta 58 to create the Beta 58A, with a completely new cartridge design, meant to mimic the old cartridge as far as polar pattern, output level, and frequency response, but with slightly different sounds characteristics; the revised design also removed the hum- bucking coil and added an output transformer.https://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/275/kw/humbucking%20coil%20beta Comparisons Regarding the difference between the Beta 58 and Beta 58A, the manufacturer's website says, \\"The Beta 58A has a completely new cartridge in it. While the new cartridge is meant to mimic the old cartridge as far as polar pattern, output level, and frequency response goes, it is a different cartridge and will sound slightly different. Two major differences are that we removed the hum bucking coil on the new model and added an output transformer.\\" Though the shape and intended applications are similar, the Beta 58A has little in common with the earlier and popular SM58. The Beta series uses a capsule and a transformer different from the SM series.

It is similar to, but slightly different in usage with, the Greek Metonic cycle. Because a tropical year is 365.24219879 days, and a synodic month is 29.53058868 days, the difference between nineteen solar years and 235 lunar months is only about two hours. Thus by adding seven intercalary months in nineteen years, the solar years and the lunar years basically synchronize. Three ancient civilizations (Babylonia, China and Israel) used lunisolar calendars and knew of the rule of the intercalation from as early as 2000 BC, about the time of the biblical Tower of Babel, the confusion of language, and dispersion of nations. Whether or not the correlation indicates cause-and-effect relationship is an open question.Harold Watkins, Time Counts: The Story of the Calendars, (New York: Philosophical Library, 1954)Robert Hannah, Greek & Roman Calendars: Construction of Time in the Classical World, (London: Duckworth, 2005) The Greek astronomer Meton in the fifth century BC discovered the same principle, and the western civilization named the cycle after him. The west later applied the Metonic cycle on the solar Roman years (Julian and Gregorian years) in the Era of the Lord (Anno Domini), a.k.a. the Common Era. The golden number is the remaining number of dividing the year in the Common Era by nineteen, plus one. The Babylonians and the Israelites used Nisan-years, and the Jews used Tishri- years, their years were lunar in nature, different in length, and the beginning of the Jewish cycle is by making the day of creation according to the Rabbinical Chronology (3761 BC) Thus the Golden Number value in the Small Mahzor is different from that in the Metonic cycle, although the principles are the same.

Located in the French departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie, its principal city is Rumilly. The name Albanais comes from the Latin Albinnum, which is derived from the names of the tribes Albii (or Albani) whose presence is attested to in the toponymy of places such as Albens, Alby, and Albigny. Geography The snow-covered Albanais, as viewed from the Princes Mountains with the Semnoz in the background The region extends from north to south and from east to west, widening above Annecy. Its terrain is a rolling peneplain, broadside at a pad of calcareous mountains to the east (the Semnoz, Mont Bange, Mont Revard) and to the west (Princes Mountains, Gros Foug, Clergeon, Cessens and La Biolle Mountains), which are attached respectively to the prealps and the Jura Mountains.

The western border rises gently to slightly less than , which overhangs the Chautagne valley almost at (the left bank of the Rhone, north of Lac du Bourget). In clear weather, the Chartreuse Mountains above Chamb√©ry are visible to the south; the Mandallaz and Sal√®ve are visible to the north, beyond which Gex and Geneva are visible. Various slopes of lesser elevation, the Bornes Massif (La Tournette, Dents de Lanfon, Parmelan), the Aravis Range, Faucigny, and the Voirons up to Mont Blanc outside Rumilly (located behind Bornes) are visible to the northeast. The principal rivers are the Fier, which travels through the Bornes whose source is at Lake Annecy, and the Ch√©ran, sourced from the Bauges. The Fier leaves the Albanais to the west via a water gap at Val-de-Fier, at an opening between the Princes Mountains and Gros Foug, from there she enters the Rhone downstream from Seyssel. The outlet of Ch√©ran in the Albanais at All√®ves, Semnoz and Mont Bange. The Sierroz, a short intermittent mountain stream, also runs into Lac du Bourget. These turbulent rivers carved out of the Albanais sandstone narrow gorges deep. History The remains of human presence dating to the neolithic were discovered in the commune of Gruffy. In early Roman times, a citadel was built in Rumilly. Under the reign of Charlemange, the Sapaudia (in actuality Savoy) was divided into seven districts, one of which was Rumilly and the pagus albanensis, corresponding to an area slightly larger than the current day Albanais. In January 867 Lothaire de Lorraine, a king of the Roman Empire, legally donated land to his wife, the queen Thiedberge, which included the Albanais communes of Ariacum (H√©ry-sur- Alby), Belmontem (Balmont), and Virilgum (a Vergloz hamlet). In November of 879, the land donation of king Boso of Provence to the abbey of Tournus involved the Albanais communes of curtem Caldatis (a hamlet of Chaux), curtem que Verilico (a hamlet of Vergloz), curtem Tudesio (Thusy), and villam Ariaco indominicatam (H√©ry-sur-Alby). These holdings were donated along with serfs of both sex and the churches which they depended on. The Albanais from then on joined the history of Savoy: in 1630 as well as from 1690 to 1697, the Savoyard States were invaded by the troops of Louis XIV of France and in 1792, the lands of Savoy were freed for the first time from the House of Savoy and was occupied by French Revolutionary forces up until 1814. After briefly being part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, a referendum ratifying the Treaty of Turin validated the annexation of Savoy to France in 1860, after which Savoy was split into the two departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie. Administration The bridge over the Ch√©ran River in Rumilly The Albanais historically covered an area slightly larger than its current day limits. There are currently 37 communes in the following three cantons: * Canton of Rumilly (Haute-Savoie) - 22,789 inhabitants (1999), : ** Communes of Bloye, Boussy, Crempigny- Bonnegu√™te, √âtercy, Hauteville-sur-Fier, Lornay, Marcellaz-Albanais, Marigny- Saint-Marcel, Massingy, Moye, Rumilly (capital), Sales, Saint-Eus√®be, Thusy, Val-de-Fier, Valli√®res, Vaulx, Versonnex * Canton of Alby-sur-Ch√©ran (Haute- Savoie) - 9,957 inhabitants (1999), : ** Communes of Alby-sur-Ch√©ran (capital), All√®ves, Chainaz-les-Frasses, Chapeiry, Cusy, Gruffy, H√©ry-sur- Alby, M√ªres, Saint-F√©lix, Saint-Sylvestre, Viuz-la-Chi√©saz * Canton of Albens (Savoie) - 6,512 inhabitants (1999), : ** Communes of Albens (capital), La Biolle, Cessens, √âpersy, Mognard, Saint-Germain-la-Chambotte, Saint-Girod, Saint-Ours One could also include in the Albanais part of the Canton of Seynod (the communes Chavanod, Montagny-les-Lanches, Quintal, Cran-Gevrier, Seynod, the former villages Chaux-Balmont and Vieugy), as well as parts of the Canton of Gr√©sy-sur-Aix (the communes Gr√©sy-sur-Aix, Saint-Offenge-Dessus, Saint- Offenge-Dessous, Montcel), respectively included in the urban agglomerations of Annecy and Aix-les-Bains. Economy The Albanais is majorly rural but the agricultural economy benefits from a diffuse urbanization that differently affects all communes. New residents and the younger generations generally work in the urban and peri-urban zones of Rumilly, Aix-les-Bains, Annecy, or further out in Chamb√©ry and Geneva. Regardless, agriculture retains importance, especially the breeding of dairy cows. The making of butter and tomme from milk was done via communal labor until recently. These factories have largely closed in the last two decades of the twentieth century. Two modern tomme manufacturers were built near Gruffy and Sales, but the milk production of the region largely exceeds their capacity. The Albanais has longtime been a home to two important industrial milk producers: Lait Mont- Blanc in Rumilly, which produced condensed milk until it was purchased by Nestl√© and began producing cereals; and the cheesemaker Picon in Saint-F√©lix, which produced cr√®me de gruy√®re and was purchased by Bel in 1968, finally closing in 2001. An important cheese production center still exists in Valli√®res. The former tobacco manufacturer in Rumilly The Albanais played an important part in the tobacco culture in France for nearly a century. Multiples rare tobacco dryers remained in production until they were abandoned in 1960, and thus a former tobacco manufacturer in Rumilly whose building was in part sacrificed for a real estate program. Tobacco crops ceded their place in the countryside to maize destined for fodder. There were previously granaries, whose mills were still functioning up until the 1950s. Either demolished or transformed into housing; they can still be seen in their location at the bottoms of valleys. Wheat was unable to be milled from the small machines run on hydroelectric power. There were also sawmills, oil mills, and small power stations (in fact, Alby was one of the first communes in France to have electricity). Timber, mostly spruce and beech, is harvested slightly throughout the region, particularly in the dominial forests of the bordering mountainous regions. Several villages also have sawmills and workshops that are used to construct woodworking joints. The cultivation of hazel nuts has essential disappeared, with the exception of on the slopes of Clergeon, as well as vineyards. Some vestiges of oil mills are remembered through the toponymy of place names. Orchards (apples, pears, cherries, prunes, etc.) have largely disappeared with the exception of the basin of Rumilly, where pears are cultivated on a relatively large scale. Alby-sur- Ch√©ran for a longtime specialized in shoemaking. A small museum retraces the history of the former factory on the Place du Troph√©e. In Rumilly there is an important industrial zone (Tefal, Nestl√©, and formerly Lait Mont-Blanc and Salomon which closed in 2008), as well as in Alby-sur-Ch√©ran (Galderma). Two new intercommunal economic activity zones (ZAEs, zone d'activit√©s √©conomiques) are under construction, one in the sector of Martenez and another in Surch√®res. These industrial and commercial zones extend into the communes of Seynod, Chavanod, and Cran-Gevrier, which border Annecy and Gr√©sy-sur-Aix, near Aix-les-Bains. In the last few years, numerous logistical services were installed and developed in the region, that have either benefited or suffered from the presence of the autoroute. However, these service industries generally pay less and require less skilled trades than the industries that have historically operated in Rumilly and the surrounding areas. La Poste has recently implanted its new industrial mail sorter for the departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie, in the industrial zone of Balvay in Rumilly at an investment cost of ‚Ç¨31 million. The sorting center has seven machines each capable of sorting 35,000 letters per hour. As a result, the regional post offices no longer sort their mail and are able to restructure their larger buildings for other purposes. Part of the main post office in Annecy was transformed into residential housing in 2008-2009. Transportation The Gare de Gr√©sy-sur-Aix The A41 autoroute, built in the 1970s, crosses the Albanais with exits at Albens/Aix-Nord (14), Alby-Rumilly (15), and Annecy-Sud (16). A new exit is under construction at Chaux, between the existing exits 15 and 16. The other routes de grande circulation in the region are the D1201 between Aix-les-Bains and Annecy, which was a route nationale (N201) until its declassification in 2008. Other routes d√©partementales include the D910 between Rumilly and Albens, the D16 (also called the route des Creuses) connecting Annecy to Rumilly, the D14, which follows the narrow passage of the Fier to reach the Chautagne, and the D911, which passes through the Ch√©ran valley to enter the Bauges. The territory is also well served by the Aix-les- Bains-Annecy railway. The Gare de Rumilly is the principal station of the territory and is served by TGV trains. Two secondary train stations are also in operation, the Gare de Gr√©sy-sur-Aix and Gare d'Albens. Train stations at Lovagny, Hauteville-sur-Fier and Bloye were closed in the 1990s with the abandonment of the bus. Two motor coach companies connect Aix-les-Bains and Annecy via Alby-sur-Ch√©ran and Saint-F√©lix. The closest airports, other than the diminutive Annecy - Haute-Savoie - Mont Blanc Airport and the Chamb√©ry Airport, which specializes in low-cost international and business flights, are the international airports Lyon-Saint Exup√©ry Airport and Geneva International Airport.

A functioning mill operated on the pond up until 1960, which for a long time provided the raw materials used in chairs. After the activity disappeared the pond, ceasing to be mowed, was filled in with an encroaching forest. The AEMC helps with the rehabilitation of the pond; volunteers have used boats to clear vegetation out of the pond, constructed an observatory, and developed a flora and fauna interpretive program which is attracting an increasing number of visitors.

She was married to Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. She was the head governess of the Swedish royal children in 1799‚Äì1803. Biography =Early life= Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie was the daughter of count Carl Julius De la Gardie and countess Magdalena Christina Stenbock. Her mother was Mistress of the Robes to Princess Sophie Albertine of Sweden, and she herself was a maid of honor to the Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. She was a participator in the amateur theatre society of King Gustav III at the royal court. She was married on 7 August 1785 at Drottningholm Palace to the King's favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. The marriage was arranged by the King. Armfelt was said to have married her because of her rank and the status of her surname: he treated her with respect but never loved her and had a parallel relationship with Magdalena Rudensch√∂ld. Hedvig Ulrika, on the other hand, was intensely in love with him, and remained loyal to him. She was described as silent, serious and reliable. =First exile= In 1792, she followed Armfelt to Naples. She was entrusted some of his papers and buried them in the garden, but the servant who buried them sold the documents and replaced them with a blank paper, which contributed to the exposure of the Armfelt conspiracy. An order of arrest was warranted on her husband, and because of it, she was herself detained several times, in Rome and Venice, during her travel from Italy to relatives in Riga in Livonia in 1794. She was allowed to keep her pension as lady-in-waiting and was given a travel sum by Duke Charles. Her husband was sentenced to death in absentia for treason, and she was banned from Sweden and from using his name. The property of her spouse in Sweden was confiscated, but as was customary, it was given to his children. As Armfelt was sentenced to death, Hedvig Ulrika was the legal guardian of their children rather than him, and was therefore given control of his Swedish property. However, she could not manage it because of her exile, so she named Axel von Fersen the Younger as the agent of her affairs in Sweden. She remained convinced of her husband's innocence, at least officially. The couple resided under the protection of Catherine the Great in Kaluga. Hedvig Ulrika acted as the agent of her husband on several occasions. She visited Paul I of Russia to ask for better conditions in 1796, but failed. When Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden was declared of legal majority in 1797, she visited the Swedish monarch and achieved permission for her to return to Sweden, to use her husband‚Äôs name to allow Armfelt to live anywhere except Sweden and Russia and to stop all active persecution toward him. She then managed to get permission from the czar to allow Armfelt to leave Russia, and in 1798, she traveled with him to Berlin. During her visit in Sweden, she consulted the fortune teller Ulrica Arfvidsson about the future of her exiled spouse, upon which she was told that her days of sorrow would soon be over, and that all would be well for her spouse.Ord och Bild, Tjugutredje √•rg√•ngen. 1914, Runeberg =Return to Sweden= In 1799, Hedvig returned to Sweden, where she was appointed head of the court of the royal children. She accepted the appointment on condition that Armfelt was allowed to return to Sweden. She was granted her wish, which was realized in 1800, after she had threatened to resign if the agreement was not honored. Armfelt was duly informed that his exile had been lifted of consideration of his wife and mother. Hedvig was greatly admired for her loyalty toward Armfelt, while he was not considered to be worthy of it. She left her position at court in 1803 with the customary title of Excellency, and was succeeded as royal governess by Charlotte Stierneld. =Second exile= In March 1811, Armfelt was exiled by the Crown Prince and de facto regent Charles John on suspicion of plots against the Crown Prince. Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie negotiated with the Crown Prince through the Queen for Armfelt, but with out success. In April 1811, Armfelt was exiled from Sweden and emigrated to Russia. Because she had expressed her rage about the verdict, the Crown Prince included her in the exile and deprived her of her pension as courtier, which was however disputed by the Queen. She joined her spouse in 1812. Before her departure, the Crown Prince surprised her at a visit to Lars von Engestr√∂m and told her that he regretted the exile of Armfelt and that he had been mistaken in him and felt nothing but respect for him. Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie was given the portraits of the Russian empresses, was given and served as lady-in- waiting to the Empress in 1820-1822. She spent her last years in Sweden. Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie was given the (Lesser) Order of Saint Catherine in 1814.

The term Neo-orientalism is generally found in academic literature to critique Western attitudes to Islam and the Islamic world post 9/11. Although the term Neo-orientalism marks a change from classical Orientalism, the two concepts nevertheless share similarities. For example, Neo-orientalism is, like Orientalism, criticised as being \\"monolithic, totalizing, reliant on a binary logic, and based on an assumption of moral and cultural superiority over the Oriental other,\\" according to Mubarak Altwaiji, Ali Behdad and Juliet A. Williams. Neo-orientalism should thus be understood more as \\"a supplement to enduring modes of Orientalist representation\\". However, Neo-orientalism also maintains distinctive characteristics from its predecessor. According to Behdad and Williams again, \\"First, whereas classical Orientalists were commonly male European savants, philologists, established writers and artists, neo-Orientalists tend to be ordinary Middle Eastern subjects whose self- proclaimed authenticity sanctions and authorizes their discourses. Contemporary neo-Orientalists are not, however, merely 'native informants' or 'comprador intellectuals' . . . but rather Middle Eastern women and men who use their native subjectivity and new-found agency in the West to render otherwise biased accounts of the region seemly more authoritative and objective. Second, in contrast to classical Orientalism‚Äôs apparent privileging of philological, cultural, and formalistic concerns over ideological ones, neo-Orientalism is marked by an unapologetic investment in and engagement with the politics of the Middle East.\\" Moreover, unlike Orientalism, the term does not yet seem to have an agreed upon definition by authors and scholars. For example, Maajid Nawaz recently adapted the term to criticize the Southern Poverty Law Center for adding his name to a list of public figures it claims are anti-Muslim extremists. Finally, unlike Orientalism, which serves as a critical approach to representations of Eastern Culture in its entirety, the present dialogue concerning neo-Orientalism seems to focus on predominantly Muslim countries, and in particular, the Middle East and North Africa.

He is one of the few Indian pilots to have also served in all three major theatres of the Second World War. Early life Mohinder Singh Pujji was born in Simla, British India, on 14 August 1918, the fourth son of Sardar Sohan Singh Pujji and his wife‚ÄîSant Kaur. His father was a senior government official who worked in the department of health and education.Rozina Visram, \\"Pujji, Mahinder Singh (1918‚Äì2010)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, January 2014; online edition, May 2014 (accessed 14 Aug 2014; requires subscription) He attended the Sir Harcourt Butler High School in Simla, then on his father's retirement to his home state of Punjab attended the Government College and later the Hindu College in Lahore. He learned to fly in 1936 as a hobby pilot at the Delhi Flying Club, where he fell in love with flying and in April 1937 achieved his \\"A\\" certificate of flying competency. His first job was with Himalayan Airways as a line pilot, flying passengers between Haridwar and Badrinath, but soon after was offered a better job with Burmah Shell, where he worked as a refuelling superintendent in 1938. Pujji married his wife Amrit Kaur in November 1944. Their first daughter Veena was born in March 1946. The couple had two more children; Rita and Satinder.Rozina Visram,\\"Pujji, Mahinder Singh (1918‚Äì2010)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, January 2014; online edition, May 2014 (accessed 14 Aug 2014; requires subscription) Their three Sikh children grew up to embrace diversity and married spouses from three different religions, showing one of the earliest acts of interfaith marriage: Veena married a Hindu businessman‚Äîowner of one of the largest Angora rabbit breeding farms, Rita married a Muslim man who worked in the aviation industry, and Satinder married his Catholic British girlfriend. War service In 1940, news of the unceasing German air attacks besieging Britain and civilian losses was reaching British India, Pujji's sense of duty and daring adventurism instinctively caused him to attend the advertised appeal for pre-qualified \\"A\\" licensed pilots at the fourth pilot's course of the Royal Indian Air Force‚Äîdespite his parents' fears; becoming one of the first batch of 24 pre- qualified \\"A\\" licensed Indian pilots accepted through this route to receive a Volunteer Reserve commission with the Royal Air Force during the early part of the Second World War. = United Kingdom and Europe = Embarking for the United Kingdom aboard SS Strathallan, arriving in Liverpool on 1st October 1940, Pujji's first posting was on 8 October 1940 to No. 1 RAF Depot in Uxbridge. Within a few days he was posted to No. 12 Elementary Flying Training School RAF at Prestwick in Scotland. From there the first 24 volunteer Indian pilots went on to No. 9 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit RAF at RAF Hullavington. From the first 24 volunteer candidates, 18 including Pujji, successfully completed the course and qualified as Royal Air Force pilots, receiving their RAF wings on 16 April 1941. A few weeks later Pujji and a handful of other pilots from the first 24 went on to the renowned No. 56 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at RAF Sutton Bridge, where they joined British and other foreign- allied pilots for advanced fighter pilot training on the Hawker Hurricane. Pujji flew active service first with No. 43 Squadron RAF from 2 June 1941, the formidable 'Fighting Cocks' fighter squadron, before being posted later in the same month to No. 258 Squadron RAF. Operating from RAF Kenley, Pujji escorted bomber offensives over occupied France, conducted Rhubarb patrols over Europe, coastal patrols and other operational sorties in defence of Britain. He flew mainly Hurricanes, which he preferred to Spitfires, for their relative ease of flying. He was forced down on several occasions; in one instance, his aircraft was disabled over the English Channel by a Messerschmitt Bf 109, but he managed to coax his aircraft to dry land, crashing near the White Cliffs of Dover. He was rescued from the burning wreckage and after a week in hospital returned to duty. He was treated well in England, experiencing as a volunteer RAF service-member favourable treatment at local cinemas and restaurants, often without payment. He subsequently commented, \\"I felt very welcome indeed, I never felt different or an outsider and my experiences in this country made me keen to return some time after the War. I was made to feel very much at home by everyone I met\\" and \\"I wrote back to my father saying that I did not mind if I was killed because the British people were wonderful and so brave, and I was being so well treated. I could not queue for a movie without being told to move to the front\\". As a Sikh, Pujji insisted on retaining his dastar Sikh headwear‚Äîeven while flying, upon which he had also attached his RAF insignia, even carrying a spare dastar, in case it was needed. The dastar, however, would interfere with use of the pilot flight headgear. On request, he was permitted to use a modified flight headgear, designing a special harness that would permit him to wear the dastar and still use his radio headphone receivers. Pujji's insistence on wearing the dastar inflight meant he could not attach the oxygen mask, it would later cost him an irreparably damaged lung caused by exposure to high-altitude flying. Subsequently, in 1960, he ceased wearing the customary dastar Sikh headwear, \\"Times changed,\\" he said. = Mediterranean and Middle East = After serving four months of active service in the European theatre of World War II, Pujji was dispatched at the end of September 1941 to Air Headquarters Western Desert in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II. In late 1941, during the North African campaign, his aircraft was forced down in the West African desert, but luckily was found and picked up by British rather than German desert troops. Desert living conditions were somewhat challenging, resulting in Pujji suffering from dietary problems, living often only on hardtack biscuits, since he could not eat the British staple issue service food bully beef for religious reasons, but was compensated by allowing him to fly at weekends to Cairo where he could enjoy a decent meal. = South-East Asia = On 16 January 1942, Pujji embarked at Suez for Colombo, British Ceylon in the South- East Asian theatre of World War II. From February 1942 through 1943, on transferring to No. 4 Squadron IAF of the Royal Indian Air Force at Kohat, Pujji would fly both the Hurricane and Westland Lysander over the North-West Frontier Province and other locations in British India. On 20 December 1943, Pujji was dispatched as flight commander to No. 6 Squadron RAF at Cox's Bazar, this time flying the Hurricane in a tactical role, rather than a fighter role, for the RAF Third Tactical Air Force; crucially providing specialist support to the British Fourteenth Army campaign. Pujji served from March 1944 in Burma, where the Japanese posed a threat to British India, moving with the squadron to the Buthidaung region which was the theatre of a major ground offensive. When some 300 US troops were lost without rations, food and radio contact, in the dense Burmese jungle swarming with Japanese soldiers, the US sent out a search party to locate them, however, after the US search party failed after 3-days to locate them, Pujji was personally requested by General William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim of the British Fourteenth Army to find them. Pujji climbed into his plane and in adverse weather flew low over treetops across Japanese occupied territory into the suspected area‚Äîand with jubilation for everyone‚ÄîPujji found them. From April 1944, Pujji transferred as flight commander to No. 4 Squadron IAF at Fenny Airfield, carrying out transport escort and merchant shipping escort. In June 1944, No. 4 Squadron IAF transferred to Comilla. With the approaching monsoon season, the role of the squadron was changed from fighter reconnaissance to light bombing, seeing action along the Sangu River during the Third Arakan Offensive. In early 1945, Pujji was transferred on attachment to Command and Staff College in Quetta (then in British India). Pujji had spent almost four years on continuous operational flying duty, considered unusual even by standards of the Second World War. = Distinguished Flying Cross = For his service bravery over Japanese occupied territory, Pujji was awarded the DFC, in recognition of gallantry and devotion to duty in the execution of air operations. Announced in The London Gazette on 17 April 1945, and followed with a personal letter of congratulations from Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, the DFC citation reads in part: Acting Flight Lieutenant Mahinder Singh Pujji No. 4 (RIAF) Squadron :\\"This officer has flown on many reconnaissance sorties over Japanese occupied territory, often in adverse monsoon weather. He has obtained much valuable information on enemy troop movements and dispositions, which enabled an air offensive to be maintained against the Japanese troops throughout the monsoon. Flight Lieutenant Pujji has shown himself to be a skilful and determined pilot who has always displayed outstanding leadership and courage.\\" Post-war life In late 1946, after suffering from a long illness of tuberculosis, which nearly cost him his life, caused him to become classified unfit for military service and receive a permanent disability discharge from service in the Indian Air Force. From 1947, Pujji was employed as an Aerodrome Officer at Safdarjung Aerodrome, Delhi, where he also continued to fly in a civilian role. From the 1950s, he went on to aspire as a recreational motor racing champion and holder of gliding records. During his career and life, he had the opportunity to personally give Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru a glider flight tour in 1959, including a glider flight for Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma and US president Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1961, he had the opportunity to personally greet Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to Udaipur and Jackie Kennedy in 1962. Pujji returned and emigrated to England in 1974, where he worked as an air traffic controller at Heathrow Airport. Some years later, Pujji moved to the United States to work as manager of a pizza retail chain, before returning to England in 1984 and settling in East Ham, and in 1998 retiring to Gravesend, Kent. On 12 October 2000, he was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Newham. In 2005, Pujji protested the British National Party's symbolic usage of a Spitfire aircraft image in their political campaign literature. He was reported as saying, > \\"The BNP are wrong to use the Spitfire as representative of their party. > They forget people from different backgrounds helped in the Second World > War. I am proof of this - I was flying a Spitfire. I also met Winston > Churchill. Even in those days, there were ethnic minorities fighting for the > British. I would recommend the armed forces for young people, regardless of > race.\\" In August 2010, Pujji's autobiography For King And Another Country was released. Pujji died of a stroke at Darent Valley Hospital, England, on 18 September 2010, aged 92. He is survived by two daughters, one son, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The local authority Gravesham Borough Council, celebrated his life and heroism with an exhibition. Recognition Despite the high respect that Pujji experienced during the War, he believed that war films presented a \\"white-only view of the RAF\\". He campaigned to raise awareness of the Indian contribution to the British war effort, which he, like many veterans, believed had been largely ignored. In 2009, Pujji acknowledged he had received no invitations to any of the many commemorative events in Britain that marked the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, or any other year, he says. He is quoted as saying, \\"As far as I think, no one in authority remembers that we are here, and we were a part of World War II\\". In an effort to redress the balance, the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford opened a permanent exhibition in January 2009 (\\"Diversity in the Royal Air Force\\"), intended to \\"challenge negative perceptions, by celebrating the racial diversity of its history\\". The museum's curator‚ÄîAl McLean, is quoted as saying: \\"Too many of our visitors are white, over 50 and middle class. I want to appeal to more than just those people. This exhibition explains a side of our story that isn't recognised ‚Äì that the RAF is not just a white public schoolboy occupation\\". Pujji was the guest of honour at the opening. Shortly before his death on 18 September 2010 aged 92, Pujji was invited to attend a wreath-laying ceremony by Philip Sidney, 2nd Viscount De L'Isle, at a memorial outside the former RAF Station Gravesend Airport, to commemorate \\"The Few\\" on the 70th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain. In 2011 the short film The Volunteers was dedicated to Pujji after he contributed to its making but died before the film's completion. =Statue= A statue of Squadron Leader Pujji, by English sculptor Douglas Jennings, was unveiled by Air Vice-Marshal Edward Stringer in St Andrew's Gardens, Gravesend, on 28 November 2014. It bears the inscription: \\"To commemorate those from around the world who served alongside Britain in all conflicts 1914-2014\\". The Gravesend community, which has one of the largest gurdwaras in the UK, raised ¬£70,000 for the statue in a month.

Sanford has been a columnist and cartoonist for the San Diego Reader since 1994, writing articles and drawing two weekly comic strips: \\"Overheard in San Diego\\" and \\"Famous Former Neighbors\\".  Career  = Comic books = Sanford, who grew up in Wallingford, Connecticut and East Lyme, Connecticut, has specialized in creating comic books and strips based on true life incidents and people. Most of the 200 or so reality-based comic books he has created were done for Revolutionary Comics, as well as for Comic Zone (UFO/Alien Encounters, Cult TV), Pop Comics (The Beatles , the Rolling Stones, Star Trek: The Original Crew), Re-Visionary Press (Sexploitation Cinema: A Cartoon History, Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History), Celebrity Comics (Elvis Scrapbook), Tower Records (Pulse!), Bluewater Productions (Orbit: the Stan Lee Story, Hard Rock Heroes), and others.

After RIP ceased publication, Rock Tales began running as a one-page true-stories comic strip on the inside back cover of each issue of Spin (magazine), founded by Flynt rival Bob Guccione Jr., publisher of Penthouse Magazine. Rock Tales appears to have ceased as of the December 2012 issue of Spin (magazine), its final newsstand edition before the print publication was cancelled and the periodical moved to website-only status. From 1996 to 1997, Sanford headed up another multi-page color comic section called Oui‚Äôs Carnal Comics, published monthly in Oui magazine, launched in the U.S. by Playboy Enterprises and at the time one of the top selling men‚Äôs periodicals. The comics frequently included the adventures of Carnal Comics character Demi the Demoness, who later became the first adult comic book character to be featured in a live action film adaptation.

He was born Robert Earl Riley on February 18, 1890 in Portland, Oregon to Harriett Miranda (Richardson) and Lester N. Riley. His father was a fire bureau captain and his grandfather ran a tannery at Multnomah Stadium (now Providence Park). School and early career Riley graduated from the Portland Academy in 1907, attended Oregon State College 1908‚Äì1910, and later the Holmes Business College in Portland. As a second lieutenant he served at the 4th Officers Training School 1918‚Äì1919. He was the superintendent of the Columbia Engine Works machine shop 1919‚Äì1931. Civil Service Commission and City Council Riley's political career began with appointment in 1928 to Portland's civil service commission, on which he served through 1930. Two years later, while he was serving as a partner in a tire company, he was named to fill a vacancy on the city council. He served on the council as commissioner of finance from 1930‚Äì1940. Mayor of Portland In November 1940, he won his first election to mayor, and was re-elected in 1944. In 1943, the United States Office of War Information and the British Ministry of Information sent Riley to Europe to tour war-torn cities and boost morale as a \\"typical American mayor\\". Perhaps he was a typical American mayor, but in 1945 Riley was charged by the influential City Club of Portland with negligence in stamping out vice and corruption. Two years later, the Portland Ministerial Alliance repeated the charges. According to historian E. Kimbark MacColl, Riley had a secret vault in his City Hall office to store his percentage of vice protection payments. In the book Vanishing Portland, the Bottenbergs reported that the Portland police were collecting $60,000 a month in protection payments from gambling and prostitution operations, with much of this money going to Riley. Despite denials of laxness in his administration, Riley lost his third mayoral campaign to the reformer Dorothy McCullough Lee. After the war, Portland Mayor Earl Riley openly declared the city could absorb only a minimum of Negros without upsetting its regular life. In its 1965 obituary of Riley, The Oregonian called him \\"a tough, able and demanding administrator and a wizard at municipal financing\\". Commissioner William A. Bowes described him as a man willing to work 18 and 20 hours a day. Later career After his mayoral loss, Riley told his friends he was through with politics. He acquired a Packard automobile dealership. The business failed when the car ceased production, and he became a car salesman for a competitor, Barnard Motors. He was an active civic leader, with an interest in the Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children and the Easter Seals campaigns. He retired from business in 1959 after suffering a serious heart attack. Personal information Riley was known as a flashy cigar-chewing man. He is described in his draft records as brown-haired and blue-eyed. He met his future wife, E. Fay Wade, while the two were attending Oregon State College, and they married on March 25, 1920. Besides the Shriner's he also belonged to the American Legion, Moose International, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Rotary International, Woodmen of the World, Royal Order of Jesters, Phi Delta Theta, Neighbors of Woodcraft, the Multnomah Athletic Club, and was a 33rd Degree Freemason. He was also a Baptist. Riley died at the age of 75 of a heart attack at his home on August 17, 1965. He is buried at Portland‚Äôs Lone Fir Cemetery. After her husband's death, Fay Riley moved to Richardson, Texas, to be with her daughter, Dorislee and son-in-law Rieves Hoffpauer. She died in Dallas, Texas on July 25, 1968, and is buried at Lone Fir Cemetery, next to her husband. References * Bottenberg, Ray and Jeanna. Vanishing Portland.

The latest of three surviving Mathew family effigies at Llandaf CathedralEarliest effigy is of David Mathew, knight(d.1484), 2nd of Sir Christopher Mathew(d.1527), eldest son of Reyborne Mathew, 2nd son of Sir David Sir David Mathew (1400‚Äì1484; born Dafydd ap Mathew, was a Welsh Knight. He was Lord of Llandaff and Seneschal of Llandaff Cathedral, and one of the ten Great Barons of Glamorgan, a Marcher Lord. It was said he was one of the most distinguished men of his age and a zealous supporter of the Yorkist cause. After saving the life of King Edward IV at the Battle of Towton in 1461, he was appointed Grand Standard Bearer of England and King Edward IV granted the use of 'Towton' on his arms. Biography Sir David Mathew was the son of Mathew ap Ieuan (or Evan).Sir David was the first to adopt the modern style of Welsh surname, \\"Mathew\\", having discontinued use of the traditional Welsh patronymic \\"ap Mathew\\", meaning \\"son of Mathew\\". The name, properly \\"Mathew\\", was spelt by Sir David's descendants variously, e.g., in the Funeral Entries, preserved in the Record Tower at Dublin, vol. vii., p. 18, the name of the founder of the Irish branch of the family is entered as \\"George Matthewes, Oct. 1670\\". Admiral Mathew of Llandaff Court, and all his descendants, spelt their name invariably \\"Mathews\\". Sir David was also Lord of Llandaff and Seneschal of Llandaff Cathedral. He had a grant of 2,232 acres of land from Henry VI, the reversion of Caneton, and from William, Earl of Pembroke lands at St Fagans and at Pentyrch. quotes Sir David was a zealous supporter of the Yorkist cause, whose extraordinary prowess and daring in the field, even at a very advanced age, were used on behalf of the White Rose of York. He was a very tall man, said to stand tall.He was buried in Llandaff Cathedral, where his altar tomb may still be seen, the effigy of him thereon measuring . At the Battle of Towton, on Palm Sunday, 29 March 1461, although by then about sixty years old, he saved the life of Edward IV and was rewarded by his grateful monarch with the honour of Grand Standard Bearer of England. Sir David was one of the ten Great Barons of Glamorgan, and a Marcher Lord. He received from Edward IV the grant of the use of the word \\"Towton\\" as an augmentation over his crest. In 1480 he restored the shrine of Saint Teilo which had been pillaged and desecrated by a gang of pirates from Biston, and was presented by Bishop Marshall with St. Teilo's skull, set in a costly reliquary, to be an heirloom in his family, who carefully preserved it for about 200 years, until the death of William Mathew in 1658 at Llandeilo. Browne Willis reported in his An survey of the Cathedral-Church of Landaff that Sir David was murdered in an altercation at Neath, West Glamorgan by some members of the Turberville family of Coity Castle.His tomb, ornamented with full-length effigy in alabaster, is in Saint Mary's Chapel in Llandaff Cathedral, which has ever since been the property and burial-place of the family of (Mathew) is one of the most interesting extant monuments of that time. An accurate description of the various monuments of the family in this chapel may be found in An survey...: \\"This is said to be the Monument of David Matthew the Great, who was Standard- Bearer to Edward IV, and was murther'd at Neath ... by some of the Turberviles, with whom he was at Variance\\" . Armorials Two different arms are recorded as having been used by the Mathew family, both consisting of a lion rampant, but with differing tinctures. The branch seated at Llandaff, thus the senior line, is generally ascribed Or, a lion rampant sable, whilst the branch seated at Radyr, descended from Sir David Mathew's younger brother, is generally ascribed Sable, a lion rampant argent. Yet confusingly the 1980 heraldic restoration of the Mathew tombs at Llandaff carried out by Hugh P. Mathew, who was recognised by the College of Arms as having proved his direct descent from Sir David Mathew, has resulted in the Radyr coat being painted on the tomb of Sir Christopher, who was head of the Llandaff branch. Rev. Murray Mathew (1895) assigns to Sir David the Radyr coat. Moreover, the Earls Landaff used the coat of the Llandaff branch even though they were descended from the Radyr branch. Unfortunately the tomb of Sir David bears no heraldry by which the confusion might be resolved. The arms of Radyr Sable, a lion rampant argent were supposedly adopted in honour of the White Rose, according to Rev Murray Mathew. =Crest= The crest is also not without confusion, being given variously as a \\"heathcock\\" (another name for partridge, of the pheasant family), a \\"moorcock\\", a \\"fieldcock\\", (a vague term possibly denoting grouse), a blackcock, (of the grouse family) and is shown on the Earl Landaff memorial in a form akin to a farmyard cock or rooster. The effigy of Sir David does however show most of the bird forming the crest of his helm upon which he rests his head, but it is missing the head. The feet are short and sturdy, suggesting a grouse-type bird and are not the long legs of a roosterThe heathcock crest may be observed on the helm of the effigy of Sir David Mathew in Llandaff Cathedral. The \\"Genealogy of the Earls of Landaff\\" gives the crest for Sir David as a blackcock proper, although the Earls of Landaff bore as crest a \\"heathcock proper\\", which is however depicted akin to a rooster on the mural monument erected in 1987 in memory of Thomas James Mathew(d.1862), son and heir of Francis Mathew, 2nd Earl Landaff in the Mathew Chapel, Llandaff () A gilded bird, probably a dove, is used as a foot-rest in the effigy of St Teilo in Llandaff Cathedral. =Motto= The motto of Mathew is in Welsh: Y Fyn Duw A Fydd (\\"What God willeth will be\\"). Family Sir David married Wenllian 1396‚Äì1470 of Glamorgan, daughter of Sir George Herbert. He left by Wenllian three sons. He had the following three sons:Lecture given by Mr J. Barry Davies at the Friends of Llandaff Cathedral 2003 annual lecture, published in \\"Friends of Llandaff Cathedral 71st annual report 2003/4\\"; Notes from site of Barry L. Matthews, www.users.qwest.net * David (born 1425 1st. son) He married Ann Myddletonn (b. 1430), with whom he had one son, Jenkyn Mathew. David was the founder of the \\"Mathews\\" American line, which would eventually arrive in the new world with Thomas Mathews (b. 1660) Thomas arrived in Halifax, Virginia, circa 1700. * Reyborn (or \\"Reinborn, Rimbron,\\" etc.)(d.1470), 2nd. son. He was the founder of the Llandaf line of Mathew, having married Isabella (or Elizabeth) Denys, daughter of Maurice Denys(d.1466), esquire, of Alveston, Glos., Sheriff of Gloucestershire, by his 2nd wife Alice Poyntz, da. of Sir Nicholas Poyntz of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire. Reyborn's will (dated 20 October 1470, proved 15 March 1471)National Archives Prob/11/6, image ref 7 directed that he should be buried in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary within The Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol, where the Poyntz family later in about 1520 built a family chapel.

Biography Laing was born a free black in Boston. He tried to make a living as an independent printer before deciding to emigrate to Liberia. The American Colonization Society, which advocated settling America's free blacks in Liberia, convinced Laing that he should study medicine because Liberia needed doctors more than printers.. Laing and another free black, Isaac H. Snowden, then studied under Horace Clarke, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital. They both applied for admission to Harvard Medical School in 1850, on the sponsorship of the Society and under the promise that they would emigrate to Liberia after earning their degrees.; . A third free black, Martin Delany, also applied separately. The Harvard faculty voted to admit all three, and Laing, Snowden and Delany attended during the 1850-51 winter semester. A majority of the school's students protested their admission and petitioned for their removal, with many students threatening to transfer.The students' petitions are described in detail in . The faculty eventually bowed to the students' pressure, so Laing and the other blacks were expelled.. Laing subsequently left the U.S. to study for two years under the French surgeon Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau in Paris.; . He returned to finish his education at Dartmouth Medical School, receiving his medical degree in 1854.. Laing became a specialist on remittant fever and moved with his wife, Anna Bicknell Parker, to Liberia, where he spent the next decade working as a physician for the American Colonization Society.. His son Joseph was born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1860; Laing also had a daughter, Mary. Laing contracted a fever in the mid-1860s, and moved his family to Charleston, South Carolina, where he died in 1869. His family would later claim that he was poisoned at a banquet held in his honor, by whites who opposed his plan to open a medical clinic for blacks. After her husband's death, Anna moved her children to Providence, Rhode Island. Mary died there in 1880. Joseph married and had four children. His daughter, Ada, eloped in 1914 with Fritz Pollard, to whom Joseph had rented a room the year before.. Pollard later became one of the first African-American players in the NFL, and the first African-American head coach. Notes References *. *. *.

Whilst she and Dr. Banda were not officially married, she served as the first lady or official hostess for several years. For several years, she was the most powerful woman in Malawi. Ms Kadzamira, is fondly referred to as \\"Mama\\", or \\"Mother of the Nation\\". Early life She was born in Southern Rhodesia and lived in Old Highfield, Salisbury (now Harare) where she attended school at Mbizi Primary. After her GCE she enrolled at Salisbury Central Hospital as a cadet nurse where she qualified and was briefly posted to Old Highfields Clinic. When her father, John Kadzamira, returned home with his family, including David Zimani Kadzamira. She joined Dr. Banda at his Limbe medical practice as a staff nurse. She is niece to John Tembo. Early career After working for Dr. Banda as a nurse at the Limbe Surgery, Cecilia moved to Zomba State House as Dr. Banda's private secretary. Political career and influence After the cabinet crisis in 1964, where Banda consolidated his political power, she was appointed the Official Government Hostess (OGH). This was suggested by the Hon. Ismael Surtee, Banda's utmost closest associate and head speaker of Zomba, making him one of the most important figures in the government beneath Banda at that time. With his influence, Kamuzu accepted. There is speculation of her role in the Machiavellian public trial and hanging of Albert Muwalo, the last MCP Secretary-General (thereafter the post was reduced to Administrative Secretary). After much resistance and ahead of the official visit by Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and the Kenyan first lady Mama Ngina, Dr. Banda finally 'succumbed'. Cecilia Kadzamira's name and title changed from OGH to Mama Tamanda C. Kadzamira, 'Mama' of the nation. In quick succession and in line with her new first lady duties, Dr. Banda announced Mama Tamanda Kadzamira would run an organization called Chitukuko Cha Amayi muMalawi (CCAM), giving her more influence in Malawian politics and greater control over who had access to Banda. In 1974, when John Tembo, as chairman of the National Celebrations Council, transferred the venue of the Youth Week Inauguration venue it to Lilongwe without Banda's authority, Kadzamira pleaded with Dr. Banda and saved Tembo from express expulsion from the MCP. Instead, Tembo was relegated to the post of governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, while Gwanda Chakuamba, then deputy commander-in-chief of the Malawi Young Pioneers, rose. She made many decisions as Banda became older and could no longer run the affairs of the country. When Dr Banda turned senile, she unsuccessfully tried to influence him to sponsor John Tembo as his successor in the party. Though Tembo had been acting in Banda's place in his absence, Banda handed the MCP political baton to Gwanda Chakuamba.  Relationship with Banda She was a confidante and friend of Kamuzu Banda. Her influence over his political and personal decisions played a significant role in the development of Banda and Malawi. The two friends were inseparable, and she influenced many aspects of his life such as who he had access to, reading materials, knowledge that was passed to him, and policies he signed. When she and Banda were going through a difficult time, Banda banned the song \\"Cecilia\\" by Simon and Garfunkel because of its lyrics that hit too close to home, such as \\"Cecilia, I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you please to come home...\\" References Malawian politicians First Ladies and Gentlemen of Malawi Malawian women in politics Living people Kadzamira, Cecilia Honorary Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order ","title":"Cecilia Kadzamira"},{"id":"28986868","text":"\\"Strangers on a Treadmill\\" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American sitcom, Modern Family and the 28th episode of the series overall.

His interest in botany began at a young age and grew to include categorization and sustainable practices. He discovered 25 new species, 48 plants are named after him and his herbarium includes 78,000 specimen, still preserved at IU Bloomington.  Early life  Charles C. Deam was born on August 30, 1865 on his family farm near Bluffton in Wells County, Indiana. Growing up on the farm, he learned the value of hard work. He earned money doing things such as building fences for another farmer, spending it on a poem book by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He was also curious from a young age and collected Indian relics he found on the farm. Deam's other interests included the natural world, something his father showed him through farm produce, garden plants and herbal remedies. When he was sixteen, he became deathly ill from typhoid fever. During this time, he received a herbal remedy of milk and old field balsams or cudweed, gradually nursing him back to good health. His mother, also sick, died despite the remedies. After graduating from high school, he went into teaching at a country school. Unimpressed, he decided to look elsewhere for work. Deam possessed a restless mind, great energy and a tendency to assert order into his world. He decided to attend DePauw University in the fall of 1885 until his money ran out in 1887. He soon sold his books and returned home where he worked odd jobs. Eventually in 1888, Deam began maintaining a store in Marion where he worked upwards of 110 hours a week. This led to a better job in Kokomo, but Deam considered it backwards. After complaining, a store supplier took note and helped him purchase a dilapidated drugstore in Bluffton during May, 1891. At this time, it was common for druggists to make their own cures, thus birthing Deam's Nerve and Bone Liniment as a claimed cure for aches and pains among men and beasts. During his time as a business owner, he continued to work long hours leading to exhaustion. One day in 1892, he got angry at a woman and she left upset. A perfume salesman in the store spoke to Deam, stating that he should see a doctor. Deam followed this advice and saw a doctor who recommended he take a half-hour walk daily, which he began doing. During the walks, he studied his surroundings, growing his interest in botany. In June 1893, he married a red- headed school teacher named Stella Mullin. They shared the common values of education and progress and she often accompanied Deam on his nature walks. During this time, he began studying plant life more intensively and discussing botany.  Botanist  In 1896, Deam met Bruce Williamson, a zoologist, who taught him about the scientific method. His love of plants grew, and his interest in taxonomy started. Soon, he was collecting plants along lanes and meadows during his hikes, but could not identify many of them. Williamson loaned him Gray's Manual of Botany, starting his interest in mounting plants. The first plant he mounted was a small snapdragon hung in September 1896 called Ilysanthes dubia. Williamson also influenced Deam by his discussion on becoming published.Harrison p. 50. Eventually, he was introduced to the Indiana Academy of Sciences (IAS) in 1899 by Williamson. The organization focused on gathering scientific minds within Indiana to share their knowledge. Their journal, Proceedings, featured Deam's first botany article, and soon he began to do an annual report on ‚ÄúPlants Rare or New in Indiana‚Äù.Harrison p. 51. By 1897, Deam obtained a botanical library and began working with other botanists, like Stanley and John Merle Coulter who wrote Forest Trees of Indiana in 1891. Deam's focus on plant identification, migration and growth was more than just for collecting, focusing on understanding the subtle changes in the environment. One instance is when he noticed that Hibiscus militaris was becoming prevalent, something he attributed to poor land management. He wrote: > ‚ÄúI have known the shores of the Wabash River near Bluffton ‚Ä¶ since 1880. In > the early history of our state our streams were clear. But when the forests > were removed, the streams became muddy and sediment was deposited on the > shores and on the gravely and rocky bars which made suitable habitat for > this species. The same is true of other plants, some of which no clog some > of our smaller streams.‚Äù = Field Work = In 1910, Deam began to focus more on plants native to Indiana, particularly vascular plants. He continued to collect plants by walking, but soon used a horse and carriage, bicycle, motorcycle, and in 1915, a Ford Model-T touring car. He customized the car with an ash frame to sleep two and added a canvas tarp to block the rain, naming it the Weed Wagon. During their often day-long adventures, Deam and his assistant (at one time Ralph Wilcox) cruised rural roads looking for new plants. Once they found a specimen, the plants were laid on newsprint for a plant press to compress and dry. On the newsprint they noted the plant's name, the habitat and gave each sample a serial number, later recording it in a specimen log. The Weed Wagon allowed Deam to go from collecting around 1,200 specimens a year to 3,760 in 1916, a year after its purchase. His ventures into the Indiana Brush are noted by Indiana University botanist Paul Weatherwax. He discussed that despite Deam doubting himself, he always worked through the day and often went were his fellow botanists would not.Harrison p. 52. Through his trips, he collected detailed knowledge on Indiana's plant life, and in 1911, he published his first book titled Trees of Indiana. It was so successful that copies sold out and required reprinting on several occasions. Deam's Shrubs of Indiana (1924) included numerous pictures from specimens at his herbarium and identification keys. His third book, Grases of Indiana (1929), garnered attraction due to its ink drawings, his ability to translate scientific knowledge to the average reader, and folklore on certain plants, like Kentucky Bluegrass. His final work, Flora of Indiana, took him eight years to complete, from 1932 to 1940. Its name is .Harrison p. 53. Weatherwax spoke of Deam's published efforts as: > \\"...of critical significance to plant taxonomy and ecology in Indiana and > the entire Midwest. Great natural areas of the native vegetation were > yielding to axe, plow, fire, and drainage; and a host of migrant species > were coming in by way of railroads, highways, and agricultural practices. > Deam's particular service was to leave an accurate and detailed record of > what plants were her and what was happening to them.\\" His work as a botanist led to the discovery of 25 new species and 48 plants are named after him. One example is the Deam Oak, a natural hybrid discovered in Wells County by Williamson. In addition, his collection efforts amounted to 78,000 plants throughout his career, documented in his herbarium.  Forester  Indiana experienced 70 years of deforestation, beginning in 1830. By 1900, Indiana's forests were nearly decimated with only 7% remaining forested compared to the height frontier settlers saw of 87%.Harrison p.46. Deam was one of few people who cared. Considered the father of Indiana forestry, he contributed greatly to sustainable development.Harrison p.54. The loss of trees affected soil erosion on plots with many new farms and lumber operations. This dramatic change led to more focus on Indiana's forests. Deam's work in botany caught the attention of Indiana Governor Thomas R. Marshall, who established the Indiana State Board of Forestry in 1909. As part of his job, he moved to Clark State Forest in Clark County. He first took the position as state forester in 1909 and remained there until 1913, taking a hiatus due to his dislike of political inquiries and campaign contributions.This was when Samuel M. Ralston was elected governor. He resumed the position in 1917 with the election of James P. Goodrich. The State Board of Forestry became the Department of Conservation in 1919, headed by Richard Lieber. In 1926, Deam noticed how many younger men received training for forestry. Desiring to concentrate on publishing, he retired from state forester in 1928 at the age of 63 only to be rehired as a state forestry researcher.Harrison p.55. Ultimately, this allowed him to invest more time into his books and revisions. In 1903, the State Board of Forestry purchased 2,000 acres (810 ha) of worn land in Clark County near Henryville, Indiana, adding to state forests under Deam's direction. Deam investigated which species were suitable for reforestation, coming to the conclusion that the poor soil supported conifers and pines best, leading to much of Indiana's new forests populated by conifers. Deam focused on educating farmers after forestry management, developing educational material to promote woodland management. Previously, farmers were taxed based on land they did and did not farm and conservation law before 1905 encouraged farmers to maintain farmland. Deam attempted to rectify this with a bill, the Forest Tax Classification Act, in 1921. Its intentions were to give farmers who agreed to protect forests on their land from fire and grazing a tax break. A total of 400,000 acres are now enrolled and protected due to the bill. His sentiment for all of these contributions is displayed by the destruction of Indiana forests by early settlers: > \\"The extreme fertility of the soil attracted the relatives and friends of > the first settlers which displaced the Indians until 1832‚Ä¶. [S]ettlement > rapidly followed and magnificent forest areas were cut and burned to obtain > more arable land‚Ä¶. People soon learned that they could enter or buy a tract > of land, sell off enough timber to erect a house and barn and to pay for the > land. Saw mills were soon built every few miles along the railroads. It was > soon learned that Indiana white oak, black walnut, yellow poplar, etc., were > among the best of their kind in the world.\\"  Death  Deam remained active late in his life, but was increasingly exhausted. On May 29, 1953, Deam died at age eighty-seven, a few months after his wife.  Legacy  Deam's work was honored by both the United States government and the state of Indiana. In 1947, he was awarded the Mary Soper Pope Memorial Award in botany.\\"Cranbrook Institute of Science Director's Papers\\". Cranbrook website. Retrieved Dec. 27, 2016. He traveled through all 1016 townships in Indiana, discovered 25 new plants and has 48 plants named for him. Charles C. Deam died on May 29, 1953. His legacy continues on with two protected areas. Charles C. Deam Wilderness, part of the Hoosier National Forest and Deam Lake State Recreation Area, an Indiana state park named after him. Deam's herbarium collection of 78,000 plants is now housed at Indiana University in Bloomington, one of the largest private collections of plants in the state. Furthermore, the work he and his associates contributed led to better sustainability practices. In 1900, 1.5 million acres were wooded in Indiana. That number is currently 4.5 million with timber harvesters planting more than they use.

It is the opposite of weather helm which is the tendency of a sailboat to \\"round up\\" into the wind. A boat with lee helm will be difficult to sail Close Hauled and tacking may be difficult. Description Lee helm is considered dangerous in a sailboat. While sailing, if left to its own devices a boat with lee helm will bear (turn) away from the wind, accelerate, and perform an accidental or uncontrolled gybe, perhaps repeatedly. In an uncontrolled gybe the force of the wind moves the sails and boom from one side of the boat to the other. In a strong wind this movement will be very fast and forceful and can damage the boat, the sails, injure the crew, and even cause the boat to broach (lie over on its side). The root cause of lee helm is when the center of pressure exerted by the wind on the sails falls too far forward of the center of resistance of the hull‚Äîthe natural point at which the hull tries to pivot. This tends to push the bow of the boat away from the wind. This can be due to a poor design, for example with the mast too far forward. A small amount of lee helm can be counteracted with the rudder, but this introduces significant drag in the water and slows the boat. A small amount of lee helm can also be cured by raking the mast backward, reducing the size of the Jib on a Sloop rigged boat, or increasing the size of the mizzen sail on a Yawl or a Ketch. Large amounts of lee helm can only be corrected by altering the placement of the mast(s) or keel/centerboard --- a non-trivial venture. Lee helm on U.S. Naval Vessels Sailors stand lee helm and helmsman watch. Traditionally there are two stations on the bridge of a sea going ship for controlling the vessel's maneuvers: the Helm, which uses a wheel (or touchscreen equivalent) to send signals to control the position of the rudder or rudders, and the Lee Helm, which traditionally inputs speed commands by operating an engine order telegraph that sends engine commands to the engineering personnel below decks. On modern US Navy surface vessels that use gas turbine or diesel propulsion, the lee helm actually directly controls the ship's speed via throttle control (either a manual throttle lever or a touch screen on some ships). The bridge throttle control directly manipulates propeller pitch and/or engine RPMs when the bridge station is in control, or switches to a traditional order telegraph when the bridge station relinquishes control or if the control system fails. The lee helm on vessels with nuclear propulsion (carriers and submarines) and conventional steam propulsion (amphibious assault ships prior to LHD-8) still uses a telegraph system. One possible origin for the Lee Helm designation for the Engine Order Telegraph is that large sailing ships had a helmsman at the wheel, plus an auxiliary helmsman, positioned on the leeward side of the helm ‚Äì hence the term \\"Lee Helm\\" ‚Äì to assist the helmsman in controlling the wheel while coming about or when the vessel is laboring in high winds or an extreme sea state.http://navyadministration.tpub.com/12966/css/12966_317.htm Modern Helm and Lee Helm with touchscreens and steering wheel used in the US Navy's Integrated Bridge and Navigation System (IBNS). The US Navy's Integrated Bridge and Navigation System (IBNS) uses two touchscreens and steering wheel for steering. The Helm is on the left, and the Lee Helm is on the right. In August 2017 the destroyer USS John S. McCain was involved in a fatal accident that killed 10 sailors.

Originating from the earlier Frontbeweging (\\"Front Movement\\"), the Frontpartij was an early attempt to fully politicise the Flemish Movement. In contrast to some of its successor movements the party supported democracy and autonomy rather than authoritarianism and independence.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, London, Roultedge, 2001, p. 300 Origins The group had its origins amongst Dutch-speaking soldiers in the Belgian Army during the First World War who resented the fact that French was the only language of command. Taking the slogan \\"All for Flanders - Flanders for Christ,\\" it attempted to organise within the army in support of equal language rights. Whilst the group was not anti-Belgian, it scared the generals, who suppressed it.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, pp. 205-6 By summer 1917, the group had re-emerged in secret and, organised by Corporal Adiel de Beuckelaere, this new version, known as the Frontbeweging, set up a structure of representatives and committees across the army.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 207 With de Beuckelaere, a Ghent schoolteacher, and other leaders such as Joris Van Severen coming from an intellectual background they attempted to articulate their demands by sending a letter to King Albert calling for a separate Flemish Army and self-government for Flanders within Belgium. However the response of high command was to repress the Frontbeweging more forcefully than before. The sudden collapse of the German Imperial Army in mid-1918 meant that the Belgian army experienced a rapid advance, leading to confusion and a lack of communication between Frontbeweging members. However, whilst the group's aims had not been met, it reconstituted after the Armistice under the name Vlaamsche Front. Political party The movement was soon formalised as a political party, adopting the name Frontpartij and continuing its campaigns for army segregation and internal self-government, as well as adding policies such as Dutch language teaching in schools and Ghent University. The party had a strong Roman Catholic identity and, whilst most of its leaders were from the urban areas of Ghent and Louvain, it developed a strong following amongst small farmers, many of whom resented the Francophone large landowners. Its ideology was vague although generally identified as left-wing and within its ranks adherents of both socialism and communism were to be found.John T. Ishiyama & Marijke Breuning, Ethnopolitics in the New Europe, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998, p. 112 Growth The 6.3% of the vote captured in the 1919 election saw the Frontpartij with five members elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, including a young Staf De Clercq. Support had in part been gained as a reaction to what was seen as the harsh treatment meted out to those Flemings that had collaborated with Germany, with the sentence of death passed on August Borms (albeit not carried out) and numerous life sentences for lesser collaborators attracting condemnation in Flanders.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, pp. 207-8 The party's vote fell in the 1921 election although it was here that Van Severen was first elected to Parliament.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 208 The loss of support proved to be a temporary set-back however as they took 25,000 votes and six seats in 1925 before following this with 132,000 votes and 11 seats in 1929. In between August Borms had even been elected to Parliament for the party in a 1928 by- election.Tom Buchanan & Martin Conway, Political Catholicism in Europe, 1918-1965, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 198 Splits and refoundation Van Severen lost his seat in the latter election however and, removed from the centre of the party and having become a disciple of Charles Maurras and admirer of Benito Mussolini, he set up his own journal, Jong Dietschland which argued for the establishment of an independent 'Greater Netherlands' in which Dutch people, Flemings, Frisians and Luxembourgers would unite in this \\"Dietsch\\" state. The plan won support amongst the students of Ghent but the war veterans that made up much of the membership of the Frontpartij were unimpressed and the party organ De Schelde specifically condemned fascism. The result of this clash was a split in the Frontpartij with the foundation of Verdinaso in October 1931 as a far right group supporting the Dietsch option.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 208-9 The Frontpartij lost a lot of support and three seats in the 1932 election and following this failure and the emergence of Verdinaso the remaining right wingers within the Frontpartij came to exercise more influence. Under the leadership of Staf de Clerq the party lurched to the right and in 1933 the party was discontinued altogether when de Clerq formed the Flemish National Union (VNV), an authoritarian rightist party.Ishiyama & Breuning, Ethnopolitics in the New Europe, pp. 112-3 VNV absorbed the Frontpartij entirely as well as a number of smaller nationalist movements and emerged as the leading voice of Flemish nationalism in the 1930s.Giovanni Capoccia, Defending Democracy: Reactions to Extremism in Interwar Europe, JHU Press, 2005, p.40 References Defunct political parties in Belgium Flemish political parties in Belgium Belgium in World War I Political parties established in 1919 1919 establishments in Belgium Flemish Movement Political parties disestablished in 1933 ","title":"Frontpartij"},{"id":"28987235","text":"The Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2010 was a New Zealand statute designed to assist reconstruction after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake.

She was reclassified as a second-class paddle sloop before bring rebuilt as a 10-gun screw sloop in 1844-45. She was fitted as an Arctic storeship in 1851 and sold for breaking in 1864. Design The vessel was designed by Robert Seppings, and built in a drydock at Chatham Dockyard. She was engined by Maudley, Sons & Field with a two-cylinder side lever steam engine developing 220 nominal horsepower. She was armed with a single 10-inch (84cwt) pivot-mounted gun, an 8-inch (52cwt) pivot-mounted gun and four 32-pounder (17cwt) carronades. On 22 March 1831, before the keel was laid down, the ship was renamed Charon, but the name Phoenix was restored less than a fortnight later.Winfield (2004) p.155-156 Service as a paddle sloop The Phoenix was commissioned on 6 November 1833 under Commander Robert Oliver, for the Channel Fleet. From 9 September 1835 to June 1838 she was commanded by Commander William Honyman Henderson, including service off coast of Spain during the First Carlist War. Captain Lord John Hay commanded her on the same duty from 19 November 1836 to 1838. From July 1838 she was under Commander Anthony W. Milward and from 1839 she spent her life in the Mediterranean, first under Commander Robert Spencer Robinson from 20 July 1839, and then, from 1 March 1840, under Commander Robert Fanshawe Stopford. Stopford was in command when she took part in the Bombardment of Acre on 3 November 1840. Subsequently she was commanded from 26 December 1840 by Commander John Richardson until she paid off on 1 January 1842. Conversion to screw sloop In April 1844 Phoenix was converted to a screw sloop by Curling & Young's at Limehouse to a design by Oliver Lang. She received a John Penn & Son 260-nominal horsepower two-cylinder vertical single-expansion steam engine driving a screw propeller. The conversion was finished by February 1845, and the developed by her new engine, combined with the more efficient screw propulsion, gave her a speed under steam of about . A further benefit of screw propulsion was the loss of the large paddle boxes, which allowed more of her deck to be used for guns; a further four carronades were fitted, making her a 10-gun ship. She was re-docked at Deptford on 1 April 1844 to be fitted with \\"Mr Steinman's patent submarine propeller\\". The conversion from paddle propulsion to screw propulsion in 1843 cost ¬£18,663. The redundant paddle engine from Phoenix was re-used in 1844 in HMS Firefly.Winfield (2004) p.163 Service as a screw sloop Diligence at Qeqertarsuaq in Greenland, in 1854 Between 1845 and 1847 she served on the Home Station and then the Mediterranean Station under the command of Commander James Dennis. On 6 February 1846 she was docked at Woolwich to have a false keel fitted to reduce her excessive rolling motion.The Times, 7 February 1846 From 1849 Commander George Wodehouse took her to the West coast of Africa, and she served there under Commander Thomas Lysaght from 1850 until she paid off on 15 August 1851. Fitted for Arctic service, she commissioned at Deptford under Captain Edward Inglefield in February 1853 with experienced arctic captain Donald Manson as ice-master, and was used to supply Sir Edward Belcher's expedition at Beechey Island. Inglefield carried the news of the discovery of the north-west passage by Robert McClure back to England in October 1853. Inglefield remained in command when she recommissioned at Woolwich on 21 February 1854, and she returned to Beechey Island to re-supply Belcher. Inglefield brought home the ship's company of HMS Investigator, which had become trapped in the ice. As an Arctic storeship, she was ideal for employment in the Russian Arctic during the Russian War of 1853 - 1856. She was commanded by Captain John Hayes, including service in the White Sea, from 10 February 1855 until she paid off at Sheerness. Fate On 26 January 1864 Phoenix was sold to Castle for breaking up at Charlton.

It was found in many eukaryotic proteins. The largest group of single strand RNA-binding protein is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence. RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF2, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu). The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases. A third helix is present during RNA binding in some cases. The RRM is reviewed in a number of publications.

History An increase in immigration to South Korea since the 2000s catalyzed more overt expressions of racism, as well as criticism of those expressions. Newspapers have frequently reported on and criticized discrimination against immigrants, in forms such as being paid lower than the minimum wage, having their wages withheld, unsafe work conditions, physical abuse, or general denigration. In a 2010‚Äì2014 World Values Survey, 44.2% of South Koreans reported they would not want a foreigner as a neighbor. Racist attitudes are more commonly expressed towards immigrants from other Asian countries and Africa, and less so towards European and white North American immigrants who can occasionally receive what has been described as \\"overly kind treatment\\". Related discrimination has also been reported with regards to mixed-race children, Chinese Korean, and North Korean immigrants. Recent legislation‚Äîin particular, the Foreign Workers' Employment Act (2004) and Support for Multicultural Families (2008)‚Äîhave improved the situation of immigrants, more efficiently protecting their human and labor rights. In 2011, the South Korean military abandoned a regulation barring mixed-race men from enlisting, and changed the oath of enlistment to not reference racial purity (minjok) to citizenship. Similarly, related concepts have been withdrawn from school curricula. This has been accredited in part to international pressure‚Äîin particular, concern from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which stated persistent ethnic-centric thinking in South Korea \\"might be an obstacle to the realization of equal treatment and respect for foreigners and people belonging to different races and cultures\\". As of January 2018, South Korea was still lacking an anti-discrimination law, which was recommended by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2015. The law has been reportedly stalled due to \\"lack of public consensus\\". As a result, it is common for people to be denied service at business establishments or in taxis because of their ethnicity. In July 2018, a mass protest against Yemen refugees who had arrived at Jeju Island caused outrage in South Korea. According to a survey conducted by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea among foreign residents in South Koreain 2019, 68.4% of respondents declared they had experienced racial discrimination, and many of them said they experienced it due of their Korean language skills (62.3%), because they were not Korean (59.7%), or due to their race (44.7%).

The cartridge is based on the .416 Rigby necked up to accept a .458 in (11.6 mm) bullet and is intended for use in magazine rifles. The cartridge should not be confused with .450 Nitro Express which was introduced by Rigby in 1898 and is a rimmed cartridge intended for use in double rifles. History In 1993, Paul Roberts (at that time proprietor of John Rigby & Company) was on an elephant hunt in the Zambezi Valley. Both he and his professional hunter, Joseph Wright, were armed with .416 Rigby rifles. An elephant was found and shot, but due to a misjudgment in the distance several more rounds were required to finally bring down the elephant. After this experience, Paul Roberts felt that a cartridge with a greater bullet weight and a larger caliber would have been more effective in that situation. Once Paul Roberts returned to the United Kingdom he necked up the .416 Rigby case to .458 caliber. The new cartridge fired a .458 in (11.6 mm) bullet weighing 480 gr (31 g) at a velocity of 2378 ft/s (725 m/s) from a 25 in (635 mm) barrel. The new cartridge was named the .450 Rigby in 1994.https://www.johnrigbyandco.com/about/history/ The cartridge was put into production in 1995. The John Rigby & Co. was building the .416 Rigby rifles on the Magnum Mauser 98 action. Since the .416 Rigby and the .450 Rigby use basically the same case, building rifles for the .450 Rigby was rather simple requiring only a chamber with a modification made in the collar area and a .458 caliber barrel. Cartridge specifications The .450 Rigby dimensions and specifications are standardized and governed by the CIP. :.450 Rigby schematic diagram complying with CIP dimensions :CIP compliant .450 Rigby Magnum Rimless cartridge schematic: All dimensions in inches [millimeters]. The CIP recommends a bore diameter of and a groove diameter of . Barrel will have a 6 grove rifling contour with a twist rate of one revolution in and a groove width of . CIP specifies a maximum pressure of . Performance Unlike many of the modern .458 caliber dangerous game cartridges like the .458 Winchester Magnum, .458 Lott, or the .460 Weatherby Magnum, the .450 Rigby was designed to operate at more moderate pressures. Maximum pressure limits enforced by CIP is given at . At these pressures, the cartridge easily reaches the intended with the bullet. The lower pressures provide greater operational reliability in tropical environments where the cartridge is intended for use. Heat can cause higher than normal pressures which can lead to difficulty in extracting the spent case. In a dangerous game hunting situation such failures can result in injury or possibly a fatality. Unlike the .458 Winchester Magnum and to a degree the .458 Lott, the .450 Rigby reaches the coveted velocity mark with the with ease and well under the pressure limits imposed by the CIP upon the cartridge. Handloaders can take advantage of the wide range of .458 caliber (11.6 mm) bullets available. Acceptable bullets weight range from to . The bullet can easily reach and staying within the pressure limitation imposed on the cartridge. Among commercial sporting cartridges, only the .460 Weatherby Magnum offers a superior performance over the .450 Rigby. However, most bullets manufactured such as those by Hornady and Woodleigh are rated for .450 Rigby velocities rather than those achievable through the .460 Weatherby. For this reason actual performance and penetration on heavy, thick-skinned game species are on par between these two cartridges. The Weatherby cartridge has a 6% greater case capacity than the .450 Rigby but operates at higher pressures. Sporting Use The .450 Rigby was designed primarily to take heavy, thick-skinned dangerous game animals in Africa. Due to the cartridge‚Äôs performance, it would be considered a better cartridge for these game species such as African elephant, Cape buffalo, rhinoceros and perhaps hippopotamus than the usual standby cartridges used on these game such as the .458 Winchester Magnum, or even the .458 Lott cartridges especially if one were to use handloaded ammunition. When hunting these game species a bullet of a tough construction is required especially at the velocities the .450 Rigby is capable of attaining. It is important to tailor the performance to the velocity rating of the bullet with regard to this cartridge as it provides a step up in performance over the cartridges the .458 caliber (11.6 mm) bullets are manufactured for. This is especially true for soft-nosed bullets as they can open up too rapidly at velocities the .450 Rigby can attain. When hunting these game species only bullets weighing of a tougher construction should be used. .450 Dakota The .450 Dakota is a variation on the design of the .450 Rigby but predates the latter cartridge by a few years. The Dakota cartridge was designed by Don Allen and is like the .450 Rigby based on the .416 Rigby case necked up to accept a .458 caliber (11.6 mm) bullet. The .450 Dakota is considered a proprietary cartridge, the rights to which are owned by Dakota Arms Inc., Remington Arms Company and the Freedom Group family of companies. Neither the CIP nor SAAMI regulate nor have oversight over this cartridge. While dimensions of the cartridges are similar they are not identical and are not interchangeable due to the shoulder dimensions and the case length. The performance of both cartridges are almost identical. However, Dakota Arms' ammunition is loaded closer to . :.450 Dakota schematic diagram : Schematic of the .450 Dakota. All dimensions in inches [millimeters]. The .450 Dakota launches a at , a at and the at . While these velocity values are greater than that of the .450 Rigby cartridge, the Dakota ammunition is loaded to near maximum pressure levels while the .450 Rigby is loaded to a pressure level far below the stipulated by the CIP. Given equal pressure level the .450 Rigby will turn out a similar performance level as the .450 Dakota cartridge; this is evident through third-party reloading data provided for the .450 Rigby. Any differences between these cartridges are strictly due to the components use and the pressure levels than due to an actual difference between the cartridges.

Uppland Runic Inscription 993 or U 993 is the Rundata catalog number for a Viking Age memorial runestone located in Brunnby, which is one kilometer west of Gunsta, Uppsala County, Sweden, which was part of the historical province of Uppland. Description This inscription consists of runic text on a serpent that circles and then becomes intertwined in the center of the design under a Christian cross. The stone, which is 1.5 meters in height, is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic inscription was carved and signed by runemasters named √ñpir and Bjorn. √ñpir was active in the Uppland region during the late eleventh or early twelfth centuries and signed almost fifty inscriptions, with another fifty attributed to him based on stylistic analysis. Runic inscriptions are often dated based upon comparative linguistic and stylistic analysis, and the inscription on U 181 has been dated as being carved approximately during the period of 1070 to 1100 C.E. The runic text states that the stone was raised by two sons, J√≥n and J«´furfast, as a memorial to their father V√≠gi, who was the son of a man named Eysteinn. The runic text is missing a possessive pronoun, the word \\"their\\" before \\"father.\\" √ñpir is known to have left off pronouns in some of his other inscricriptions, such as U Fv1976;107 at the Uppsala Cathedral, U 961 in Vaksala, and U 984 in Ekeby. p. 107.

Environmental interest in producing artificial systems is motivated by recognition that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. The process has not been commercialized. Overview Photochemical reduction involves chemical reduction (redox) generated from the photoexcitation of another molecule, called a photosensitizer. To harness the sun's energy, the photosensitizer must be able to absorb light within the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. Crabtree, R.-H.; ‚ÄúThe Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals, 4th ed.‚Äù John Wiley & Sons: New York, 2005. Molecular sensitizers that meet this criterion often include a metal center, as the d-orbital splitting in organometallic species often falls within the energy range of far-UV and visible light. The reduction process begins with excitation of the photosensitizer, as mentioned. This causes the movement of an electron from the metal center into the functional ligands. This movement is termed a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Back-electron transfer from the ligands to the metal after the charge transfer, which yields no net result, is prevented by including an electron-donating species in solution. Successful photosensitizers have a long-lived excited state, usually due to the interconversion from singlet to triplet states, that allow time for electron donors to interact with the metal center. Common donors in photochemical reduction include triethylamine (TEA), triethanolamine (TEOA), and 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH). An example of photoexcitation using Ru(bpy)3 and triethylamine. The net result is a lone electron, originating from the metal, residing in the aromatic bipyridine moiety of Ru(bpy)3. After excitation, CO2 coordinates or otherwise interacts with the inner coordination sphere of the reduced metal. Common products include formate, formic acid, carbon monoxide, and methanol. Note that light absorption and catalytic reduction may occur at the same metal center or on different metal centers. That is, a photosensitizer and catalyst may be tethered through an organic linkage that provides for electronic communication between the species. In this case, the two metal centers form a bimetallic supramolecular complex. And, the excited electron that had resided on the functional ligands of photosensitizer passes through the ancillary ligands to the catalytic center, which becomes a one-electron reduced (OER) species. The advantage of dividing the two processes among different centers is in the ability to tune each center for a particular task, whether through selecting different metals or ligands. thumb|340px|right|An example of a supramolecular complex capable of photochemical reduction. Notice the photosensitizer on left tethered to the catalytic complex on the right. History In the 1980s, Lehn observed that Co(I) species were produced in solutions containing CoCl2, 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), a tertiary amine, and a Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photosensitizer. The high affinity of CO2 to cobalt centers led both him and Ziessel to study cobalt centers as electrocatalysts for reduction. In 1982, they reported CO and H2 as products from the irradiation of a solution containing 700ml of CO2, Ru(bpy)3 and Co(bpy). Since the work of Lehn and Ziessel, several catalysts have been paired with the Ru(bpy)3 photosensitizer. When paired with methylviologen, cobalt, and nickel-based catalysts, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas are observed as products. Paired with rhenium catalysts, carbon monoxide is observed as the major product, and with ruthenium catalysts formic acid is observed. Some product selection is attainable through tuning of the reaction environment. Other photosensitizers have also been employed as catalysts. They include FeTPP (TPP=5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine) and CoTPP, both of which produce CO while the latter produces formate also. Non-metal photocatalysts include pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbenes. thumb|620px|center|A reaction scheme for the catalytic reduction of CO2 by Re(bpy)CO3Cl.

An English newcomer to the United States as of 1963, he initially acts as financial officer at Sterling Cooper, but eventually leaves, along with a handful of his co-workers, to form a new agency, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. For his performance, Harris was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2012. Fictional character biography =Background and personality= Born in London on May 10, 1916, Lane was raised by Robert Pryce (W. Morgan Sheppard), himself a middle-class traveling salesman, in a strict, regimented home. In his adulthood, Lane served in the British Army as a supply assistant in Rosyth. Although he never saw combat, he was later thanked by a British veteran of World War II who said his resupply effort saved lives and \\"England expects every man to do her duty\\". After his military career was over, Lane attended accounting school. He then married a woman named Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz), with whom he had a son named Nigel. Some time later, he got hired by an advertising agency named Putnam Powell and Lowe. Eventually he was promoted to an executive position, responsible for mergers and takeovers. Lane is portrayed as being caught between two worlds; he struggles to be himself while adjusting to his new life in America. He genuinely enjoys the United States, which he feels is detached from the rigidity and economic decay that is becoming associated with both blue-collar and white-collar England. He often appears stiff and reserved; although he does enjoy a drink, it is not to the extent of Don, who was known to drink during work hours. He isn't particularly keen on football, though he was seen in a bar with fellow British expats cheering England's performance in the 1966 World Cup Final and was able to make contacts to set up a potential account with Jaguar. =Sterling Cooper= PPL sends Lane to Sterling Cooper, which the company had recently acquired, tasking him with trimming operating expenses. He begins by firing many employees, including long-time employee Burt Peterson (Michael Gaston), who was the head of accounts, and naming Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) and Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton) as his joint successors. Lane angers Creative Director Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and becomes isolated from the company when he expresses PPL's lack of interest in a potentially lucrative account with Madison Square Garden. Although he is initially unaware of PPL's plans for Sterling Cooper, he later learns that he has been instructed to cut overhead so that the company can be sold for a profit. Lane's superiors at PPL announce that after sale, he is to be transferred to India - a plan that is aborted after his would-be replacement is injured in a freak accident. Don, Roger Sterling (John Slattery), and Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse) convince him to join them in starting a new agency, making him a named partner in exchange for \\"firing\\" the three of them in order to void their contracts, which contain non-compete clauses that would have otherwise prohibited their continued work in advertising. =Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce= It soon becomes apparent that Lane has a knack for managing company revenues and controlling costs, a talent the other partners lack, which is needed at the new firm. Lane, along with office manager Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks), is credited with keeping the company running and managing the day-to-day operations. In Season 4, Lane's marriage falls apart, as Rebecca, who genuinely loves him, finds the strains of homesickness and culture shock too much to bear, and returns with their son to London indefinitely. Lane and Don end up meeting at work, then get drunk and go for a night out on the town, which includes seeing Gojira. Lane makes monster noises and slurred Japanese remarks to a married couple in the audience, which Don considers hilarious but is taken as obnoxious by the husband of the couple, who nearly challenges both Lane and Don to take it outside. Lane then sleeps with a prostitute supplied by Don. Lane reimburses Don for the money he spent on the prostitute, and thanks him for the \\"welcome distraction\\". When Lane's family is supposed to come to New York to see him, he is instead visited by his elderly father, who intends to take Lane home to England to sort out his affairs. Around the same time, Lane begins a relationship with a young African-American Playboy Bunny named Toni (Naturi Naughton), and later introduces her to his father. His father beats Lane with his cane, ordering him to return to London to reunite with his family. Lane takes a short leave-of-absence from the agency, and later returns to New York with his family, who by now are more accepting of being overseas. Although he seems to gotten his home life in order, Lane still has signs of a wandering eye, particularly when he finds a lost wallet. Lane does not touch any of the man's cash or credit cards, but notices he has an attractive wife and keeps the wallet photo for himself prior to contacting the owner. In Season 5, Lane faces severe financial troubles due to owing an extensive amount of taxes and struggles to keep his balance at work. During three years at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, he has been operating at a loss and struggles to turn the agency around. Though Lane and Joan are friendly compatriots, responsible for keeping the company physically running, Lane often makes inappropriate sexual remarks that upset and disgust her. Lane is the one responsible for getting Joan her 5% speaking partnership. While ultimately in Joan's best long-term interests, Lane makes the suggestion to her as a means of covering up his embezzlement. If she had accepted the original cash offer, his theft would have been discovered, but the cashless partnership kept it concealed a while longer. =Death= While Lane's work has been critical to SCDP, he has struggled with making ends meet while having to agree to being poorly paid to keep SCDP afloat during its shaky early times. When his $50,000 partnership fee comes due, Lane liquidates a corresponding amount in securities he had with a brokerage house in the UK. This subjects him to another financial issue; England's high taxes of the 1960s. To pay the tax collector, Lane embezzles $7,500 from the company by forging Don's signature on a supposed Christmas bonus payment he anticipates receiving. However, he is left feeling uneasy when the partners announce they will be forgoing their bonuses for that year. Bert Cooper discovers the cancelled check when looking through unopened account statements. Bert confronts Don about his approving a bonus payment to Lane when the firm decided to not pay bonuses. Don tells Bert he will handle it, but does not inform him that he did not sign the check. Don meets with Lane, who admits to the embezzlement after trying to lie his way out of it. Don demands an explanation, first thinking Lane is gambling, but then gets the story that he had to cover his partnership fee and then the tax collector. Don says Lane should have informed him of the matter. Erupting with anger, Lane insists he could not bear the shame of asking for a loan and has never been compensated for his contribution to the agency; he also makes a snide remark about Don's jet set lifestyle, and generally tries to justify his fraudulent actions. Don has lost all trust in Lane, though, and says that while he will cover the $7,500, Lane will need to resign and gives him the weekend to \\"think of an elegant exit.\\" Lane then uncharacteristically flirts with Joan, makes a lewd remark to her, and seems grimly happy when she responds with muted anger. Upon returning home after this encounter, Lane discovers that Rebecca, unaware of their financial situation, has bought him a new Jaguar (paid by check). Lane puts his affairs in order and attempts to take his life via carbon monoxide poisoning; however, the attempt fails when the Jaguar doesn't start. He then goes to SCDP, types a resignation letter, and hangs himself in his office. Joan arrives Monday morning to assume her usual duties, but has trouble opening the door to Lane's office. She gets suspicious when the small part of the door she does get ajar shows yellowish gunk on the floor and thinks it is dried urine. She goes to Pete Campbell, whose office is adjacent to Lane's, who then discovers what has happened when he stands on his sofa to peep into Lane's office. The partners send all SCDP employees home, falsely claiming they need to evacuate due to a gas leak, and also find a boilerplate resignation letter. When Don shows up with Roger, Bert breaks the news to him. Don is aghast that everyone left Lane's office as is (as the police told them to stay out of the office so a report could be made) and demands Lane's body be cut down immediately. In the wake of Lane's suicide, the partners are left mourning the loss. Joan, in particular, feels guilty over dismissing his advances, and she confesses to Don that she feels responsible for his death. Ironically, Lane's death ending up costing Don significantly more than the stolen money. Besides the loss of a skilled partner who was indeed trying to get SCDP out of the red, Lane was under contract, as were the other partners, that in case of death the partnership fees were to go to the next of kin within a 7-year deadline before legal action would be invoked. Don's failure to tell anyone else nor alert the authorities did not give prior evidence of defalcation; and Lane's boilerplate letter was not much to go by with a paper trail. As the suicide occurred prior to Don's Monday deadline of \\"an elegant exit\\", it meant Lane died while technically employed at SCDP. Rather than get embroiled in a questionable legal issue, Don elects to make a full refund of Lane's $50,000 fee to Rebecca Pryce. In response, Rebecca claims that Lane was worth more to the agency than $50,000 and accuses Don and the partners of filling \\"a man like that with ambition\\", leading to his suicide. She also accuses Don of egging her late husband into committing adultery. Although true (by way of the prostitute), Rebecca's basis is the wallet photo of the attractive woman Lane pilfered, which Don has no clue about and honestly tells Mrs. Pryce he never saw that woman before. Later, Don saw hallucinations of his brother, which were likely psychological as Adam's fate was the exact same as Lane's (hanged himself after Don told him \\"I want you out of my life\\").

It is a subspecies of the silvereye that occurs on islands off the coast of Queensland in north-eastern Australia, and which is sometimes considered to be a full species.Kikkawa (2003). Description The Capricorn silvereye is the only bird endemic to the Great Barrier Reef. It was first described by Archibald Campbell and Samuel White in The Emu from specimens collected during an expedition by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union to the Capricorn Group in October 1910. They wrote: > Zosterops were numerous, and appeared to breed on the islands, judging by a > few old nests. As at some of our more southern camps, it was delightful to > listen to the subdued chorus of the birds‚Äô sweet warbling songs at daybreak. > Regularly on Masthead they commenced to warble from 10 to 5 minutes before 5 > o‚Äôclock. > White-eyes were observed in great numbers on North-West and Tryon Islands, > where, also, the nesting season had not yet commenced. Several skins were > procured ‚Äì the first by Mr J.W.

Should further > research prove them different, we venture to suggest the name Z. > chlorocephalus, or Green-headed White-eye (on account of the ‚Äúclean-cut‚Äù > markings of that colour), the following being the general description: ‚Äì > Male. ‚Äì Distinct ring of silvery-white round the eye, succeeded by a black > line under the eye; head, mantle, upper wing coverts, and upper tail coverts > bright olive-green; back grey, blending into the greenish mantle; wings and > tail dark brown, the primaries and tail feathers edged with bright olive- > green; chin, throat, and under tail coverts greenish-yellow; rest of the > under surface grayish-blue, darkest on the chest, and approaching grayish- > white on the abdomen.

The sexes of the Capricorn silvereye are visually indistinguishable. The subspecies is substantially larger than Z. l. cornwalli, the taxon occupying the mainland coast opposite the Capricorn and Bunker Islands, from which it is derived, and from which it has been separated for not more than four millennia, or about 500 generations, following its colonisation of the islands.Clegg et al. (2008). The bird has been used as a model to investigate the hypothesis that passerines on islands have a tendency to evolve larger forms. The lectotype is an unsexed specimen from North West Island, held by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 700956).Australian Faunal Directory. Aerial view of 16-ha Heron Island from the south, site of a long- term study of the Capricorn silvereye Distribution and habitat The Capricorn silvereye is restricted to wooded coral cays of the Capricorn and Bunker Group at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland. It is the only passerine species to breed regularly on 16 ha Heron Island. There it has been the subject of long-term biological studies by the University of Queensland which operates the Heron Island Research Station, with the island population having been continuously and accurately monitored since 1965. Its habitat comprises typical cay vegetation of the region, mainly of Pisonia grandis forest forming a closed canopy up to 15 m in height, with areas of Casuarina equisetifolia, Silky Celtis, Sweet Sandpaper Fig, Octopus Bush and associated shrubs, as well as areas around human habitation, such as the Heron Island resort.Kikkawa & Wilson (1983). Behaviour =Breeding= Studies on Heron Island have shown that Capricorn silvereyes mate for life with the same partner. They are not only socially, but also genetically monogamous birds, and their territories are actively defended by both members of the pair during the breeding season.Robertson et al. (2001). Breeding is seasonal, beginning in the dry season of winter and spring (August‚ÄìNovember), with the peak of the first clutch laying occurring in September‚ÄìOctober and the chicks hatching when early wet season rains have stimulated the availability of insects. With the onset of the nesting season, males start roosting by themselves and singing from a high, but often concealed, perch at dawn as they establish, or reestablish, their territory. The territory defended by a pair is usually restricted to the tree in which the nest is built, and its immediate vicinity. Beginning as early as August, nests are built in dense foliage, usually in a terminal fork of a Pisonia branch, though several other plants may be used. The cup-shaped nest is constructed by both members of the pair from dry grasses and other vegetable material, as well as cobwebs and various kinds of anthropogenic debris such as toilet paper, fishing line and human hair. Nests may take up to a week or more to complete. The usual clutch is of three pale blue eggs, with an incubation period of 12‚Äì14 days. The hatchlings are altricial and nidicolous and are fed by both parents. The chicks fledge at 12‚Äì14 days old and leave the nest shortly afterwards, still being fed by their parents for about another two weeks. In a study of the 1969/70 breeding season, the mean number of fledglings produced per nest was 1.9. Second and third clutches extend breeding through much of the wet season into January. =Feeding= The silvereyes forage in small flocks, or sometimes singly when feeding young. They are not confined to their breeding territories, though the adults forage near them from the ground to the forest canopy, often around concentrated food sources. They consume a wide range of plant and animal food, including insects and other small invertebrates, fruit and nectar. The sweet sandpaper fig is an important source of food on Heron Island.Higgins et al. (2006). =Vocalisation= The song of the Capricorn silvereye is a warble containing a series of separate notes; it is complex, with a well-organised hierarchy of syllables and sequences. A bird's song repertoire is established by its first breeding season. Singing takes place in the breeding season during a 20-minute dawn chorus by all territorial males; it is also heard occasionally throughout the day. The song rate averages six to seven songs per minute during the dawn chorus; each song is about five seconds long and contains an average of 16 notes.Slater (1993). Population and mortality A study of population dynamics on 16 ha Heron Island between 1979 and 1993, during which over 90% of the birds were individually colour-banded, recorded that the population there fluctuated between 225 and 483 individuals. Four cyclones during that period caused substantial mortality. There was also evidence of the effects of density dependence in the size of the adult population, and with fledgling survival decreasing with the numbers of birds attempting to breed.McCallum (2000). The main cause of the total loss of nestlings from a nest is faulty nest construction leading to tilting. Early dry season nests can suffer damage from the loss of supporting leaves in the tree canopy, while late season nests are at risk from heavy rain and strong winds. Young fledglings are vulnerable to predation by eastern reef egrets in the trees, and by silver gulls and buff-banded rails on the ground.

Invented in 2000 by Berlin-based artist Florian Thalhofer, Korsakow allows users without any programming expertise to create and interact with non-linear or database-driven narratives, referred to as Korsakow-Films or K-Films. The software can be used to produce documentary, experimental and fictional narrative works and has been integrated into live performance and installation pieces. Korsakow is currently 299 US$ for the PRO version. Educational licenses are also available. Versions =Development and Early Versions= In the late 1990s, Florian Thalhofer began developing a software program to produce a documentary about alcohol consumption to accompany his Master's thesis. During his research, Thalhofer learned about an effect of extreme alcoholism known as \\"Korsakoff's Syndrome,\\" characterized by short-term memory loss and a compulsion to tell stories. Thalhofer borrowed the name for his thesis and first Korsakow-film, \\"Korsakow Syndrom\\". From 2000 to 2015 the application has been released as free software. = Version 6 = Released in October 2016, Korsakow 6 is now exporting to html5. =Version 5= Released in July 2009, the newest version of the Korsakow System involved a complete overhaul of the previous versions. This upgrade was produced under the aegis of the Concordia Interactive Narrative Experimentation Research Group (CINER-G, 2007-2011). CINER-G was funded by a research/creation grant from the Quebec Government's Fonds de recherche sur la soci√©t√© et la culture (FQRSC). In 2011 CINER-G was succeeded by Adventures in Research/Creation. ARC ARC was funded by a research/creation grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRC) from 2011 to 2015. Thalhofer remained the creative lead during the project, while Matt Soar co-directed the project and also designed the current logo. The coding is by David Reisch with early assistance from Stuart Thiel. Korsakow FAQ Soar left the project in 2016. In addition to addressing many of the problems with version 3, version 5.0 was recreated from scratch in Java as open source software. The new version of the application can export as a .swf file which requires flash player to view, currently a much more common browser extension than Shockwave. Another change offered in the new version is the ability to design and use an unlimited number of interfaces per film. As the developers believed that the jump from version 3 to the current version was so substantial that, as an inside joke, they skipped 4.0 altogether. Korsakow-Films =SNUs= Though it may be used as such, the Korsakow System was not intended as a choose your own adventure builder. Instead, the intention of the software is to create narratives based on dynamic relationships between very short video clips, rather than on predetermined paths. In order to achieve this, each Korsakow- film is composed of multiple SNUs or smallest narrative units. These are usually short video clips ranging from 20 seconds to a few minutes in duration and are the building blocks of each Korsakow-film. Users of the Korsakow software \\"SNUify\\" their media by adding rules guiding the relationship between each SNU. Each SNU can be assigned \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" tags. Whenever a clip begins, the database will be queried for other SNUs whose \\"in\\" tags match the \\"out\\" tags of the current video. Any matches will be displayed as related options for viewing. Queries can be cued at specific points during the current SNU. As part of a non-linear narrative, each SNU may be reused within the narrative. SNUs may be assigned a number of \\"lives\\" or times they are allowed to appear within the narrative. The term \\"SNU\\" (smallest narrative unit) was coined by experimental filmmaker Prof. Heinz Emigholz at a lecture at the University of the Arts in Berlin on February 6, 2002. The lecture was later published in his book \\"Das schwarze Schamquadrat\\" . =Compatibility= The following file formats can be accepted by the software: * Video files: .mp4 (codec: H.264) * Previews: .jpg, .gif, .png, .mov (H.264) * Startscreen: .jpg, .png, .gif * Audio files: .wav, .mp3 * Subtitles: .srt =Interface= Films output on Korsakow version 3 or earlier could only be viewed online in a single generic interface. This layout involved a single primary frame, in which the selected clips would play, and up to three preview frames of other related clips.

A native of Owego, New York, Catlin studied law in New York City before returning to Owego to begin his career. He joined the Union Army in the first days of the Civil War and rose to become commander of the 109th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Severely wounded during the Battle of the Crater, he remained on the field and led his regiment until being injured a second time, resulting in the loss of his leg. For this action, he was awarded the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. After the war, Catlin moved to Brooklyn and established himself as a criminal defense lawyer and district attorney. He was politically active but lost a race for Mayor of Brooklyn and declined several other opportunities to run for higher offices. Early life and family Catlin was born on July 8, 1835, in Owego, New York, to Nathaniel and Jane (Brodhead) Catlin. After receiving his early education at Owego Academy, he attended Hobart College in Geneva for a single year. In 1856, he moved to New York City to study law and was admitted to the bar the next year. Returning to Owego in 1859, he joined his brother-in-law Benjamin F. Tracy's law firm, Tracy, Warner & Walker. Tracy, who had married Catlin's sister Delinda in 1851, would also earn the Medal of Honor in the Civil War and would go on to become United States Secretary of the Navy. Catlin was elected mayor of Owego in 1860 and continued in that role until the outbreak of war. In 1862 in Brooklyn, Catlin married Virginia H.S. Bacon; the couple had one son and one daughter. Military service Immediately after President Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers at the beginning of the Civil War, Catlin raised a company of infantry and was appointed its captain. The unit, said to be \\"the first full company which enlisted in the North,\\" was mustered in on May 14, 1861, as part of Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Regarding the regiment's participation in the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861, Townsend remarked: \\"There was no braver officer on that field than Captain Catlin.\\" Following the battle, the unit was stationed at Fort McHenry in Maryland. Catlin resigned his position in the 3rd New York on March 14, 1862, and rejoined the Army five months later, on August 2, with the 109th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He began his service with the 109th as a first lieutenant but was promoted to lieutenant colonel only weeks later. Promoted to full colonel on July 29, 1864, he led the 109th New York in the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, Virginia, the next day. During the battle, he was seriously wounded but returned to the field and continued to lead his regiment until being struck a second time. The second wound necessitated the amputation of his right leg. For this action, he was given a brevet promotion to major general on March 13, 1865, and awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on January 13, 1899. Catlin's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > In a heroic effort to rally the disorganized troops was disabled by a severe > wound. While being carried from the field he recovered somewhat and bravely > started to return to his command, when he received a second wound, which > necessitated amputation of his right leg. Catlin was mustered out of the volunteer army on June 4, 1865, and joined the regular army as a captain on May 6, 1867. On that same date, he was given the regular army brevet ranks of major, for his actions at the Battle of the Wilderness, and lieutenant colonel, for his actions at Petersburg. He retired from the military on May 6, 1870, and was simultaneously promoted to colonel. While on the retired list he was again promoted, to brigadier general, on April 23, 1904. Legal and political career After the war, Catlin returned to the practice of law in Owego before moving to Brooklyn and establishing a legal career there. He was elected the district attorney of Tioga County in 1865 and six years later, in 1871, formed a law partnership in Brooklyn with his brother-in-law, Benjamin F. Tracy. That same year, he became an Assistant Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. He worked as a criminal defense lawyer and served as legal counsel for the Kings County Sheriff for nine years. In 1877 he was elected Kings County District Attorney and was re- elected to that position in 1880. Catlin was also involved in politics; he was a Republican except for a period from 1888 to 1896, when he identified as a \\"Cleveland Democrat\\". He ran for Mayor of the City of Brooklyn in 1885 but was unsuccessful. He turned down nominations to run for Congress in 1893 and for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the Democratic ticket in 1896. At the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Catlin volunteered for military duty but was turned down due to his advanced age. He instead visited Cuba and the Philippines and wrote widely published reports on the situations in those areas. His son, George de Grasse Catlin, served in the U.S. Army during the war and rose to the rank of captain. In his later years, Catlin split his time between homes in Brooklyn and Owego. He was a member of the New York Society of Colonial Wars. In January 1916 he suffered a stroke and died a week later, on January 19, at his apartment in Brooklyn's Hotel St. George. Aged 80 at his death, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.

Angel Food Ministries was a Monroe, Georgia, based nonprofit organization that provided a monthly food service to over 500,000 families. The ministry was a nondenominational program located in 43 states across the United States and the District of Columbia, distributing food from 5,200 locations. There were 473 distribution centers in Georgia and more than 1,400 concentrated in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. The headquarters was located in a warehouse in Monroe. The ministry employed 220 full-time employees and 500 temporary workers. The program bought food in bulk at discount price and then sold it in family sized quantities, while spreading the word of Christ. The ministry delivered $120 million in direct food assistance to families and nourished over 22 million Americans. In 2005, the ministry received the largest USDA grant ever given to a faith-based organization. The ministry closed in September 2011 as a result of a federal fraud investigation.  Founders  Joe and Linda Wingo founded Angel Food Ministries in 1994 in Monroe, Georgia. They started the half charity and half business to help 34 families struggling financially by dispensing 34 boxes off the back porch of his home when numerous industrial plants closed in their community. Joe Wingo was a pastor at a local church the Emmanuel Praise Center in Monroe.  Boxes  Each month, Angel Food Ministries created a variety of different sized boxes of food for about half of what they would cost at a grocery store. The boxes could be ordered online or through the churches that the boxes are picked up at once a month. The food items in the box changed from month to month with a wide variety of meat, vegetables, and fruits; each box could contain a pamphlet concerning the word of Christ. There were specialty boxes that could be ordered such as gluten free, specialty meats, after-school, fresh produce and prepackaged heat and serve meals. Each box contained enough food to last a family of four for about a week and a senior citizen about a month. The signature boxes ranged from thirty one dollars to fifty one dollars as of March 2011. The boxes could also be purchased with food stamps, as a result of a partnership between Angel Food Ministries and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). There is no set amount on how many boxes that can be ordered, nor is it based on income. There are no applications or qualifications needed to be able to purchase a box.  Programs  No Child Goes Without Project was a program created to feed about 1,700 children for a month through food boxes. Each box of food cost $24 and could be donated online or through churches that sponsor the program. The boxes were distributed to twelve low-income schools. This was a first for distributing food to school for Angel Food Ministries. As a holiday program, people could buy a Thanksgiving or Christmas box that was provided for free to the families of people who serving overseas, or armed service members readjusting to life. The boxes were provided by people who buy a box of food designated for a family of a U.S. service man or woman serving today. The organization is extending the benefit to non-military families. In 2005, the ministry received a $6.9 million loan from the USDA, allowing it to expand significantly. This was the largest government loan ever given to a faith-based initiative, and administered by the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. At the peak of the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico, Angel Food fed 40,000 people in Pensacola, Florida, for free on one day.  Lawsuit and federal charges  Former cold storage facility of Angel Food Ministries in Monroe, Georgia. In 2006, the ministry reported revenue of $96 million and $17 million in expenses. Tax records from that year show the Wingos and two of their sons earned a combined total in excess of $2.1 million for leading the ministry, up from just less than a combined $323,000 a year earlier. Their combined salaries dipped to $501,472 in 2007, records showed. A lawsuit filed February 2009 in a Georgia Superior Court in Walton County, alleged that the Wingos used the nonprofit organization to enrich themselves from food vendors and by rerouting money to themselves through their church, Emmanuel Praise Center. Craig Atnip and David Prather, two Angel Food Ministry board members filed the suit against the Wingos, and the suit asked a judge to bar Joe and Linda Wingo and their two sons from the property of the organization and to protect the assets of the ministry. The suit alleged that the Wingos enriched themselves by at least $2.7 million, which includes $600,000, which was allegedly given to the Wingos for a \\"housing allowance,\\" directed from Angel Food Ministry to their church. The lawsuit also claimed that the food buyer for Angel Food Ministry, Andy Wingo, habitually took kickbacks as part of transactions with food vendors and that at least one family member knew about it. The suit also alleged that Joe Wingo set up a North Carolina corporation to buy a personal jet and then leased the jet to Angel Food Ministries for a profit of $10,000 a month. The suit additionally alleged the Wingos used the Angel Food credit cards and spent more than $850,000 for personal possessions. Angel Food Ministries offered its full cooperation in the investigation and voluntarily agreed to provide any records the government wished to examine. The two board members who sued the nonprofit and the Wingos have come to an agreement in Walton County, Ga., Superior Court. The agreement approved by the court, the Wingos' company credit cards will be canceled, the nonprofit will undergo a forensic financial audit, and Joe Wingo will sign over to Angel Food a company he owns that was renting the corporate jet to the nonprofit organization. The two board member who filed the suit agreed to leave the organization as a part of the deal and Angel Food must pay $45,000 in Atnip's and Prather's legal fees. They will retain standing to take any actions when the forensic audit comes in. Joe Wingo and his son, Wesley, will retain their roles at the agency. During the hearing, attorneys said Linda Wingo left her position last year and son Andy left in late 2007. In their June settlement, both sides agreed the audit would be kept under seal of the court. Angel Food's February 1 filing also claimed that the defendants had complied with all other provisions of the June 19 court order, which was modified slightly on October 1. Angel Food, the filing said, has eliminated all personal use of Angel Food credit cards by the Wingos; arranged for Angel Food to lease an airplane owned by North Carolina Aviation Leasing from under supervision of the Angel Food board, with no personal use allowed; paid Atnip $282,693 and continues to pay him $13,461.54 twice a month; and paid plaintiffs' counsel $45,000. In December 2011, the Wingo family and two others were issued a federal indictment for 49 counts of fraud. On August 29, 2013, Wesley and Andrew Wingo were sentenced to seven years in federal detention for money laundering and conspiracy charges. Linda Wingo was sentenced to five years probation, while Ministries employee Harry Michaels previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  Similar groups  Low-cost food boxes are available in the Atlanta, Georgia, area through The Box Food Ministries. Similarly, a program is available in Kenosha, Wisconsin, through New Hope Ministries. In the nearby Kenosha community, boxes are available through the Self Help and Resource Exchange (SHARE) program. The Ohio-based Smart Choice Food program offers food packages for sale in ten midwestern states, in almost an identical format to Angel Food Ministries, and using many of the former Angel Food Ministries host sites as outlets. The largest difference between Angel Food Ministries and Smart Choice Food is that the latter is organized as a for-profit business rather than a not-for-profit organization. In November 2011, OneHarvest Food Ministries began serving communities throughout the Southeast region of the US. OneHarvest distributes in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas (Dallas/Fort Worth) and Virginia. OneHarvest is a non-profit, non- denominational, faith-based organization. By partnering with local churches, OneHarvest offers a once monthly distribution of low-cost prepaid food boxes. An EBT payment option is available at some distribution sites.  Reorganization  Angel Food Ministries posted on their website that they would not be distributing boxes in September 2011. They also mentioned restructuring or reorganizing the ministry citing economic hardships. As of September 23, 2011, Angel food ministries shut down operations after 17 years of operation citing the economic difficulties expressed earlier in the month. \\"... At this time we regret to inform you that we have not found a solution that will allow Angel Food Ministries to continue to distribute food on a monthly basis and have decided to cease operations....\\" Former employees and partners were unable to re-organize and have given up efforts.

It is home to the Patrons of Husbandry Chapter 234. Built in 1839 as a church, it is architecturally significant for its Greek Revival features, and socially significant for the ongoing role of the Grange chapter in the local community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Blow-Me-Down Grange is located in the village center of Plainfield, on the east side of New Hampshire Route 12A south of its junction with Paterson Road. It is a 1-1/2 story brick building with a gabled roof, and a two-stage tower which rises from the peak of the roof at its front (west side). The main facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances flanked by large sash windows and topped by smaller ones. The stages of the tower are plainly finished except for slender Ionic columns flanking the louvers of the upper stage. The interior, originally a single story with balcony, was converted to two stories in 1939-40. Although the interior of the first floor is now used as a meeting space with kitchen, many of the original pews are still in the building, and signs of the presence of more are visible on the pine floors. The second-story hall's stage is decorated with a large oil painting, originally made by Lucia Fairchild Fuller for the Woman's Building of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

He was part of the British men's team at the 2012 Summer Olympics that won bronze in the team competition. He is also a three-time junior European champion and won individual horizontal bar gold at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore. Personal life Sam Oldham was born on 17 February 1993 to Bob and Dawn Oldham. Oldham currently lives in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, England with his parents and three siblings. Sam's first school was Crossdale Drive Primary School in Keyworth. Oldham then attended Rushcliffe School in West Bridgford before leaving the institution at 14 to be home-taught so he could focus on training. Oldham first started in gymnastics at the age of seven on the recommendation of his teacher, but was also a talented footballer. Oldham played in the Notts County F.C. Centre of Excellence as a forward until the club closed it down. Despite receiving offers from Nottingham Forest F.C. and Derby County F.C., Oldham chose to focus on gymnastics. Oldham's father and grandfather were both footballers, and his younger brother currently plays in the Nottingham Forest youth setup. Oldham is a Manchester United F.C. fan and considers Vitaly Scherbo to be the gymnast he would most like to compete against, for the latter's performance winning six golds at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Career =Junior career= Oldham left Rushcliffe School and moved to Huntingdon at the age of 14 to train with the 2008 Summer Olympics- bound gymnasts, where he lodged with the family of fellow gymnast, Cameron MacKenzie. His other training partners included eventual pommel horse bronze medallist Louis Smith. Smith later thanked Oldham for being his training partner leading up to Beijing. At the European Gymnastics Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2008, where he was the youngest member of the British team, Oldham broke his wrist during his floor routine. However, he managed to complete his routine one-handed and helped the British team to gold in the junior team event. Late in 2008, a Castle Donington-based company agreed to sponsor Oldham up to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Oldham was named to the British team for the 2009 Australian Youth Olympic Festival, where he won team gold. Later that year, he was selected to be in the British delegation to the European Youth Olympic Festival in Tampere, Finland, where he won two golds in the pommel horse and parallel bars events. Oldham was named BBC East Midlands' Junior Sports Personality of the Year in 2009 for his performances in Tampere and for sweeping all seven golds available at the English national championships. At the 2010 European Gymnastics Championships in Birmingham, England, Oldham won three gold medals, becoming European junior champion in the team all-around, the horizontal bar, and the individual all-around. By winning the individual all-around, Oldham secured qualification to represent Great Britain at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore. In Singapore, Oldham qualified second overall for the all-around competition and made the finals in four other events ‚Äì the floor, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Oldham was in the silver medal position in the all-around final when he suffered a fall from the horizontal bar, his final apparatus, thus finishing fifth. However, he recovered from the setback to win silver in the pommel horse event, missing out on gold by 0.25 points. Oldham subsequently followed that by winning gold in the horizontal bar event, on the same apparatus in which he had suffered his fall during the all-around competition. Despite going first out of the eight finalists, Oldham's score of 14.375 points held out throughout and was enough for gold.https://www.scotsman.com/sport/oldham-strikes-gb-gold-faultless- horizontal-bar-display-1708089?amp After the Games, Oldham's coach Paul Hall described Oldham as having a chance of making the British team for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, while Smith called Oldham is an \\"amazing talent\\" and British head gymnastics coach Andre Popov predicted Oldham will \\"absolutely\\" become Olympic champion. Oldham considered trying for the 2010 Commonwealth Games team. However, according to Oldham, this plan was shelved when he was selected to the British senior team for the 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. For his performances in 2010, Oldham was shortlisted for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year Award, and for Junior Sportsperson of the Year Award at the Nottinghamshire Sports Awards, the latter of which he won. =Senior career= Oldham was named as Great Britain's reserve gymnast to participate at the 2010 senior world championships in Rotterdam. He was the youngest member of the British men's team. The British team qualified for the final and finished seventh in the team all-around, although Oldham did not ultimately take part in the competition. In 2011, Oldham was included along with Samuel Hunter, Daniel Purvis, Theo Seager, Louis Smith and Kristian Thomas in the British squad travelling to Berlin, Germany for the 2011 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships from 6 to 10 April, again as the youngest member of the delegation representing Great Britain. Oldham qualified as the second reserve for the parallel bars final and in fourth place for the final on the horizontal bar. He came fourth in the horizontal bar final, which was his first major senior final. Oldham was to have been part of the British squad at the London Prepares series gymnastics Olympic qualifier in January 2012, but missed out after breaking his collarbone before the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in October 2011, and further injuring himself during that competition. Without Oldham, the British team secured qualification to the gymnastics events at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Despite his injury setback, Oldham ended the first year of his senior career by winning all-around silver at the British national championships, which doubled as the final selection trial for the Olympic Games. Oldham attributed his performance, which he said was \\"better than I could ever have hoped for\\" and was good enough to see him named to the British squad for the Olympics over Dan Keatings, to the trials being the final chance to impress the Olympic selectors after his injury layoff. At 19, Oldham was the youngest member to be named to the British team for gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which won a bronze medal in the men's team all-around final at the North Greenwich Arena on 30 July. On 19‚Äì25 May 2014, at the 2014 European Championships in Sofia. Oldham along with his teammates (Daniel Keatings, Daniel Purvis, Max Whitlock, Kristian Thomas) won Team Great Britain the silver medal behind Russia with a total score of 262.087 points. In event finals, Oldham won the silver medal in high bar (14.866) behind 2012 Olympic champion Epke Zonderland. Oldham suffered from ankle ligament damage at the Commonwealth Games in July 2014, but returned to competition nine months later. Although he was third overall in the all-around and won the floor exercise in the final trial for the Olympics, he did not make the squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

It has been referred to as being the world's first \\"flapless\\" aircraft. The Demon was developed as a demonstrator for the flapless air vehicle integrated industrial research (FLAVIIR) programme. Developed from the conventional BAE Systems Eclipse UAV, it was used to trial an unconventional aircraft flight control system over the course of two years. Various other technologies were also experimented with, including modular and cost-reduction techniques. On 17 September 2010, the Demon conducted its first flight without using any conventional flight control surfaces. It has been speculated that the technology has potential applications in both civilian and military aviation. Development During the early 21st century, British defence conglomerate BAE Systems initiated a five-year research programme known as flapless air vehicle integrated industrial research (FLAVIIR). This effort had a declared budget of ¬£6.5 million, which was financed by both BAE Systems and the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. It had the aim of developing and testing a new aerodynamic circulation-based aircraft flight control system, manipulating airflow via non-traditional means; unlike most prior efforts, it sought to bring technologies together to form a functional system rather than develop isolated elements. Participants in the programme included various British aeronautics companies, specialists, and academic institutions included Cranfield University and nine other British universities.\\"Developing the next generation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with BAE Systems.\\" Cranfield University, Retrieved: 6 July 2019.\\"Flaviir project trials new forms of wing command.\\" The Engineer, 11 July 2010. During August 2007, an American patent was filed for elements of this new control system concept, it was granted during July 2011. As development proceeded, it was decided that producing an experimental unmanned air vehicle to demonstrate manoeuvring without the aid of conventional flight control surfaces. The conventional BAE Systems Eclipse was selected as the basis for the demonstrator.

The Demon participated in a two-year demonstration programme, during which the team studied the UAV's performance throughout its flight envelope. On 17 September 2010, the Demon performed its first flight in which all of its conventional control surfaces were deactivated during a portion of the flight off the coast of Cumbria, having flown out of Barrow/Walney Island Airport.\\"BAE‚Äôs flapless UAV is breath of fresh air.\\" Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 6 October 2010.\\"Showcase UAV demonstrates 'Flapless Flight'.\\" phys.org, 27 September 2010. Richard Williams, BAE's programme director for future capability, stated of the occasion: \\"I feel sure I have witnessed a significant moment in aviation history\\". In late 2010, BAE Systems stated that the Demon shall not be followed up by a direct production aircraft, but its technologies would be filtered through to other platforms instead.Ford, Jason. \\"MAGMA jet-powered UAV sets course for flapless flight.\\" The Engineer, 14 December 2017. Aerospace periodical Flight International speculated that this unique circulation control system could one day be employed in civilian aviation to reduce the size of the wing on widebody airliners. Its developers have stated their hopes that the new technology could be used to reduce noise, cut fuel consumption, and lower maintenance costs. In terms of military applications, the technology might enable future combat aircraft to achieve greater levels of stealth than conventionally equipped counterparts. Design The BAE Systems Demon is an experimental unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In terms of its basic configuration, it is a blended wing-body aircraft, possessing an approximate wingspan of 8-foot (2.5m) and a weight of 200 lbs (90 kg). In flight, it could attain a maximum speed of 150kts. It was outfitted with a conventional flap-based flight control system which can be switched on and off during flight, allowing the aircraft could alternate between its experimental and conventional control system. The Demon was built to flight test a novel aerodynamic control system. This system uses a combination of engine exhaust gas, which is redirected using a thrust vectoring nozzle, and bleed air, which is precisely controlled to provide control over the same aerodynamic forces that would be traditionally provided by numerous flight control surfaces, including flaps, ailerons and elevators. Referred to as \\"fluidic flight controls\\", the arrangement used on the Demon reportedly function by directing air from a rectangular exhaust nozzle over upper and lower surfaces, utilising the CoandƒÉ effect to establish control over pitch.\\"DEMON UAV - Flying Without Flaps.\\" BAE Systems, Retrieved: 6 July 2019. For roll control, bleed air is blown over a Coanda surface installed on the trailing edge of the wing. By controlling boundary layer conditions, the fluidic controls can also generate either greater lift or drag during the take-off and landing phases of flight. Beyond the novel flight control system, the Demon was used to trial various other technologies, such as the manufacture and assembly of a fully bonded structure. This structure possessed low cost material reinforcing features, which reportedly achieved roughly 50% cost savings over the use of conventional manufacturing processes. A key goal of the demonstrator was to trial cheaper, more modular UAV technology, exploring designs have been generated through cross-disciplinary interactions.

The name Skitalets means \\"wanderer\\" in Russian.  Early life  Skitalets was born in Samara Province to a peasant father who had once been a serf. After gaining his freedom Skitalets's father spent some time as a village bartender and later took to wandering through Russia, with his young son in tow, the two making a living together as street and barroom musicians for several years. Afterwards they returned to Samara province where Skitalets's father settled down as a joiner. Skitalets's father taught him to play the gusli, and Skitalets was well known in later life for his skill with the instrument and for being a talented folk singer. He spoke of his early years with his father in a short poem: \\"His gusli my singer father left, / He left me songs my share, / To sow his peasant seed song gift / To grow in my native air. During the years of wandering with his father he often experienced want and bad conditions, but he was also able to collect a wealth of experiences, meeting different people and travelling widely throughout Russia. After being expelled from the Samara Teacher's Seminary in 1887 under suspicion of political radicalism, he went out on his own in southern Russia, working as a clerk, actor, singer, writing for several papers, and taking part in the student revolutionary movement.  Career  Skitalets playing the gusli with Maxim Gorky. In 1898 he met Maxim Gorky, whose fame was already on the rise, and the two became close friends. This meeting was the deciding point of his young life. Skitalets came to Moscow with Gorky where he joined the Sreda, a literary group founded by the writer Nikolay Teleshov, which included many of Russia's most popular authors and artists, such as Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, Fyodor Chaliapin, Gorky and, when he was in town, Anton Chekhov. In 1902 Skitalets's first collection of stories and poems was published by Gorky's company Znanie (Knowledge). During this time he published poetry, short stories, and novellas, most of which were read and discussed among his friends in the Sreda. One of his songs, which he first sang at a meeting of the Sreda, was included in the beginning of the second act of Gorky's play The Lower Depths. The song begins with the lines: The sun rises and sets / But my prison is dark, dark. He was also the author of a popular folk song about Stepan Razin. Skitalets's revolutionary poetry was praised by Vladimir Lenin among others. One of his revolutionary poems, recited at a charity event in 1902, can be found on the List of Russian language poets. His reading of this poem and several others caused an uproar of cheers and shouts, leading to the event being broken up by the police, and to the arrest of Leonid Andreyev, who'd been the event's organizer. Andreyev was eventually acquitted in court. Skitalets was arrested for his revolutionary activities in 1888, 1901 (with Gorky in Nizhny Novgorod), 1902 and 1905. He continued publishing his works separately and in collected editions through the years leading up to World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Later life Skitalets (top left), with fellow Sreda members in 1902. During World War 1 Skitalets served as a medical orderly, and published several works condemning the war. He welcomed and supported the 1917 Revolution. He lived abroad from 1922 to 1934 in Harbin China where he worked for several newspapers, and contributed works to Soviet journals. He also spent some time in Australia on assignment. He returned to Russia in July, 1934, renewed his friendship with Gorky and again took part in literary and social life. He published the novels The House of the Chernovs in 1935 and Fetters in 1940. He died in Moscow in 1941, and was buried in the Vvedenskoye Cemetery.

In 1839, two Iroquois Indians met Father De Smet at Council Bluff, by chance, and they relayed the request again. In July 1840, Father De Smet was greeted by more than 1,000 Salish and Pend d'Oreille Indians in Pierre's Hole.Baumler, Ellen: A Cross in the Wilderness. St. Mary's Mission Celebrates 175 Years.

On September 24 the next year, Father De Smet returned to the Salish. Accompanying him to the Bitterroot Valley were Fathers Gregory Mengarini and Nicholas Point, as well as Brothers Joseph Specht, William Claessens, and Charles Huett. Building the mission Brother Claessens was a carpenter and led the building of the church. As construction began under the supervision of Pierre-Jean De Smet, he described St. Mary's and the Salish workforce as follows: > The women hewed down the timber, assisted by their husbands, with the > greatest alacrity and expedition, and in a few weeks we had constructed a > log church, capable of holding 900 persons. To ornament the interior, the > women placed mats of a species long grass, which were hung on the roof and > sides of the church, and spread over the floor,-- it was then adorned with > festoons formed of branches of cedar and pine.Smet, Pierre.

They were built in harmony with that plan although it made the village open to attacks. A palisade shielded the church. The first communion was at Easter 1842. At this time, Chief Victor held the position as principal representative for the Bitterroot Salish. Father Anthony Ravalli joined the mission in 1845. He inoculated the Indians against smallpox and ran the dispensary. In 1846, the fields yielded 7,000 bushels of wheat and a considerable quantum of garden crops. However, by this time many Salish Indians had turned their backs to the mission and slowly, took up their former lifestyle. They felt betrayed by the establishment of a mission at Colville for the Blackfeet, who were their enemies. The mission was closed and destroyed Raids by those Blackfeet Indians closed the mission in 1850. The abandoned church was burned to the ground, following the usual practice in such raids. The Jesuits then sold the village to Trader John Owen for 250 dollars, even though it had been built on Salish land. Reestablishment and changes to the mission After sixteen years, St. Mary's mission started afresh in 1866. It was relocated a mile south of the first colony. The Catholic Salish attended sermons in the new church and later, settlers in the area would come as well. The church was enlarged in 1879. in October 1891, Chief Charlo and the Bitterroot Valley Indians were moved to join other Salish already living in the Jocko Reservation. That was the end of St. Mary's as an Indian mission. The mission complex today The mission complex is open for tours from April through October. The buildings include the chapel with an attached residence, the infirmary, a dovecote, a cabin with Salish artifacts, and a visitor's center that contains a museum, a research library, an art gallery, and a gift shop.

It produces ready mix concrete under its Certified brand, a large range of concrete masonry (or grey masonry), paving, segmental retaining walls and veneers. It also has a range of bagged, pre- mixed product that is marketed under the Dricon brand.  History  The business from which Firth evolved started at Matamata, New Zealand, in 1865. This original business was established by Josiah Clifton Firth, who arrived in New Zealand in 1856. On arriving Josiah decided that Auckland needed a modern flour mill. But first it needed a brick-making factory, so he built his own. Meanwhile, his son, E. C. Firth, invented the ‚Äòironclad‚Äô pumice washing boiler. This manufacturing business was later taken on by his sons, Ted and Tony Firth, and it was their joint venture that became Firth Concrete Limited. In the beginning, concrete products in New Zealand were manufactured by hand in small-scale operations. But over the next fifty years driven by two successive building booms, the Firth brothers took their business from a two- man operation to a large, diverse business with branches throughout the country. In 1927 the company acquired its ‚ÄòIronclad‚Äô logo, designed by Clifton Firth. In 1938 it introduced New Zealand's first machine-made concrete blocks. The blocks were cast by a machine called a ‚ÄòRockcrete‚Äô at the company's Frankton factory in Hamilton. Firth's modern history began in 1973 when Fletcher Holdings bought a minor holding in the company, completing a full buy-out in 1979.

Wittliff. The film stars Willie Nelson and Morgan Fairchild. It is based on Nelson's album Red Headed Stranger (1975). Plot A preacher (Nelson) from the East arrives in Montana to spread the gospel. When his wife (Fairchild) takes off with another man, he straps on his pistol and seeks vengeance. Then he must find a way to redeem himself. Production Wittliff met Willie Nelson in the late 1970s. Wittliff was a writer on Honeysuckle Rose (1980) and Barbarosa (1982), which both starred Nelson. Nelson played his Red Headed Stranger for Wittliff and Wittliff agreed to write a script based on the musical storyline. Wittliff finished a draft in 1979 and Universal Studios green-lighted the film with a budget of $14 million. The studio wanted Robert Redford to play the \\"Red Headed Stranger,\\" a role Nelson had envisioned for himself. It took two years, but Redford finally turned the part down. Nelson and Wittliff gave back their advances to buy the script back.Alison Macor. Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids 30 Years of Filmmaking in Austin, Texas University of Texas Press: Austin, 2010. HBO took an interest in the script and budgeted $5 million to produce it. Sam Peckinpah was attached to direct the film, but Peckinpah was unhappy with the low budget and left the project. The project died at HBO and Nelson and Wittliff began to raise the $5 million on their own. The budget ended up at $1.8 million, coming from a diverse group of investors including Bud Shrake and Darrell Royal. Red Headed Stranger began production on April 29, 1985. The main set, a western town nicknamed \\"Willieville,\\" had been built over the previous two years across the road from Nelson's golf course, thirty miles west of Austin, Texas. Most of the filming was done in \\"Willieville,\\" but nine other locations around Central Texas were also used. Production wrapped on June 14, 1985. Release Red Headed Stranger debuted at the Denver International Film Festival in October 1985. Critical response was mediocre and called the movie \\"dull\\" (Variety) and \\"an insipid story\\" (The Denver Post). The film opened in Nelson and Wittliff's home state of Texas, where it received a warmer welcome. The movie then had a limited national release in larger cities such as Seattle, Washington and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The journal describes what Peterson's work means culturally, how it broke down barriers, and surmounted obstacles. The article also describes those who were involved in making it a success and a pioneering work.Reid, Mark A. \\"Take a Giant Step. A Raisin in the Sun; The U.S. Black Family Film\\". Jump Cut; A Review of Contemporary Media. No. 36. May 1991. Pages 81-88. In the film of Take a Giant Step, the part of Spencer Scott was played by Johnny Nash, a popular rock-and-roll performer. Spencer Scott's father was played by Frederick O'Neal, who co-founded the American Negro Theatre. O'Neal also played the part on Broadway. The story is about a black teen, Spencer, living in white community. His white teacher claims that black slaves were \\"too lazy\\" to fight for their freedom. Spencer refutes this, and he is then expelled from school. When hIs father upholds the teacher's right, the teenage is thus thrust into a painful and difficult position.

The character is portrayed by actress Heather Morris, and first appeared in the show's second episode, \\"Showmance\\". Brittany was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. In Glee, Brittany is a ditzy cheerleader, or \\"Cheerio\\", for the fictional William McKinley High School, and a member of the school's glee club led by Will Schuester. Morris was originally hired to teach Beyonc√©'s \\"Single Ladies\\" dance to the Glee cast. At that time, the series was looking for a third cheerleader, and Morris landed the role. Morris was upgraded to a series regular in the series' second season, in which Brittany is given a larger storyline, solos and dance routines to perform. Morris plays Brittany as unconventional, often scatterbrained, but also entirely well-meaning and goodhearted. She has said that Brittany \\"love[s] everybody, no matter who they are\\"; she is frequently smiling and being nice to people. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, mistaking her nipples for pepperoni, thinking her cat, Lord Tubbington, is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. These facts are often presented in one- liners delivered by Morris, many of which she has ad-libbed. Brittany's one- liners are regularly celebrated in reviews of Glee. The character's lack of intelligence and forthright manner of speaking means, as Morris puts it, that \\"Brittany is used by the series' writers to say things no other character would\\". The character has also received positive reviews related to her romantic storyline with her closeted best friend Santana (Naya Rivera). While Brittany is bisexual, and is unashamed of that, Santana had trouble accepting her homosexuality. However, Brittany always supported Santana and urged her to be true to herself. The character has been received favorably with television critics. Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post compared Morris as Brittany to Jane Lynch as Sue Sylvester and opined that she \\"emerged as one of the funniest second bananas on TV right now\\". Wieselman wrote that since her introduction, Brittany has been given \\"more and more to do [and] less and less to think\\", and that the result has been \\"one of the most clueless characters that's ever figured out how to dress herself in the morning.\\" Snarker called Brittany and Santana her \\"new favourite Glee pairing\\", and commented: \\"While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they‚Äôve made it count. Heather in particular has brought the laughs as the Cheerio least likely to get a Mensa invitation.\\" Brittany has attracted comparison to Amanda Seyfried's character from the 2004 hit teen comedy Mean Girls. Morris also received acclaim for her dancing and her portrayal as Brittany. Storylines =Season 1= Brittany first appears in Glee during the show's second episode, as a member of William McKinley High's cheerleading team, the Cheerios. She joins the glee club, New Directions, with her friends and fellow cheerleaders Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) then enlists the three of them to help her destroy the club from the inside. When the club is due to compete at the sectionals round of show choir competition, Brittany unknowingly leaks their set list to Sue, who leaks the routines to competing glee clubs. New Directions put a new set list together at the last minute, and go on to win the competition regardless. Brittany also reveals that she and Santana have had sex, but are not dating. Following the club's victory at sectionals, Sue renews her effort to bring them down, and enlists Brittany and Santana to break up co-captains Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). They invite Finn on a date with the both of them, but ignore him throughout the evening and ultimately request that he sit in the car and leave them to finish their meal alone. She mentions in the episode \\"Bad Reputation\\" that she has made out with almost everyone in the school ‚Äì guys and girls alike, and the school janitor. She also briefly dates Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) in the episode \\"Laryngitis\\" as he wants to appear more masculine to impress his father and he is the only guy she has not made out with in the school. =Season 2= In the second season episode \\"Duets\\", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet competition while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was just using him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in \\"Never Been Kissed\\", he gets her to go out with him again. As of \\"Furt\\", they are officially dating. In \\"Sexy\\", following her performance of \\"Landslide\\" with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and would never do anything to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that if she and Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so. =Season 3= Brittany runs for senior class president in the third season, starting in \\"I Am Unicorn\\", and wins the election in \\"I Kissed a Girl\\", defeating Kurt in the balloting. She and Santana join the Troubletones, a rival all-girls show choir at McKinley, and formally begin dating; after Santana is outed by Finn, they are open about their relationship. The two rejoin New Directions after the Troubletones lose to them at Sectionals. Santana sends Brittany a singing valentine in \\"Heart\\", and the two publicly kiss afterward. In \\"Saturday Night Glee-ver\\", concerned about Santana's future plans, Brittany gets the idea to ask Sue to arrange for Santana to get a full scholarship to the top college cheerleading program in the country. After a year of being a do-nothing class president, Brittany puts on a dinosaur-themed senior prom. In the season finale, Brittany reveals that her grades are so bad she is not graduating, but will have to repeat her senior year. =Season 4= In the first episode of the fourth season, Brittany competes to become the lead singer of New Directions, but loses to Blaine (Darren Criss). She then loses to him again when she runs to be a second-term senior class president. Santana formally breaks up with Brittany because she feels that their long- distance relationship is not working, though the two remain friends. She then becomes 'blonde buddies' with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and then starts to date him. Santana comes back to try and break them up, however fails. Brittany visits MIT, where she is dubbed a mathematical genius. Returning to Lima, she becomes arrogant, refuses to perform at Regionals, leaves the Cheerios, and breaks up with Sam. After Will and Sue fail to get Brittany to change her attitude, Sam gets Santana to return to Lima to intervene. After talking with Santana, Brittany decides to perform at Regionals. Brittany reveals to the glee club she has been offered early admission to MIT and delivers an emotional goodbye, as she will be leaving after Regionals. =Season 5= Brittany returns to McKinley in \\"100\\" along with other New Directions alumni following the closure of the Glee club. Brittany states her unhappiness at being a math genius and kisses her ex-girlfriend Santana. In \\"New Directions\\", Brittany agrees to dropping out of MIT before going on a trip to Lesbos with Santana. Santana asks Brittany to go with her to New York after their trip, and Brittany accepts. Brittany finally graduates in the episode, one year late. Brittany returns to New York in the last episode of the season \\"The Untitled Rachel Berry Project\\" but she finds out that Santana is out of town shooting another Yeast-I-Stat commercial. =Season 6= At the beginning of season six, Brittany returns with Santana and the rest of Glee club alumni to McKinley High School in \\"Homecoming\\" to help Rachel and Kurt recruit for New Directions. In \\"Jagged Little Tapestry\\", while the alumni stick around for another week, Brittany is surprised by Santana's marriage proposal and gladly accepts. Brittany and Santana then return in \\"What The World Needs Now\\" to deal with Santana's disapproving grandmother Alma ‚Äì with whom she hasn‚Äôt spoken since coming out as a lesbian. Brittany takes matters into her own hands and tries to invite Alma to the wedding, but Alma's prejudice is too strong and she rejects their engagement, and Brittany tells her off for doing so. Later the New Directions serenade them in an attempt to be invited to their upcoming wedding. Brittany and Santana are wed in a double ceremony with Kurt and Blaine in the eighth episode \\"A Wedding\\". Before the ceremony, Sue arrives with Alma, who she has helped to realize that although she may not believe females should marry each other, family is the most important thing, leading her and Santana to reconcile. Brittany and Santana return briefly in the last minutes of the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\" for a last performance with the rest of the Glee Cast to take a bow. Creation and casting Heather Morris (pictured) improvised many of Brittany's one-liners during filming Brittany first appears as a guest character in the second episode of the first season of Glee. She was brought in as a member of William McKinley High's cheerleading team, the Cheerios. Brittany is regularly played by actress Heather Morris. Morris grew up with a strong background in choreography. She was taking acting classes and actively pursuing an acting career when she was offered a spot on recording artist Beyonc√© Knowles world tour as a dancer. Morris, however, turned down the job. Shortly thereafter, she was asked by Glee choreographer Zach Woodlee to teach the choreography for Beyonc√©'s \\"Single Ladies\\" dance to the Glee actors. At the same time, the show was looking for a third cheerleader, they originally wanted to have the third be African American, but Morris ended up landing the role of Brittany Pierce. Initially a background character who hardly ever spoke, the role grew as writers discovered Morris had a gift for delivering one-liners. In an interview with Brandon Voss of The Advocate.com, Morris said of her casting: Brittany's role in the show was initially intended to be minor, but grew towards the end of the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would have one in the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: \\"It's so fun. I literally just stand there and doze off and then I'm like, 'Oh yeah, I have to speak now! At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated that Brittany would have \\"big storylines\\" in the new season, as viewers want to know more about her. Characterization Some of Brittany's most memorable lines are unscripted, and are instead devised by Murphy during filming, or improvised by Morris. Morris portrays Brittany as being \\"literally insane.\\" She is used by the series' writers to say things no other character would, to the point that Morris considers some of her lines nonsensical. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. She is friendly towards all the other characters, and Morris has explained that Brittany \\"love[s] everybody, no matter who they are\\", so she is frequently smiling and being nice to people. Morris bases her portrayal of Brittany on the character Karen Smith from the film Mean Girls. She plays Brittany as being very innocent, rather than stupid. In the episode \\"A Night of Neglect\\", Brittany participates in an academic decathlon as a seat warmer, but surprisingly ends up contributing to the win due to the fact that she is somewhat of an idiot savant on the topic of cat diseases. It is also revealed in \\"Britney/Brittany\\" that Brittany is also \\"Britney Spears\\" as her middle initial is \\"S\\" making her \\"Brittany S. Pierce.\\" At the Paley Festival Glee panel in March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana would be seen to make out during the show's first season. Morris and Rivera only became aware of this after reading a Paley Festival report online. When they asked Murphy about the development, he claimed to have made the statement \\"to get a kick\\" out of the \\"dirty guy\\" asking about them. Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were \\"organic and natural.\\" While there are moments on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: \\"that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and being really close. It's always her and I just messing around and they end up using it.\\" Later in 2010, when interviewed by After Ellen and discussing the large lesbian audience of Glee, Ryan Murphy confirmed that season two would contain at least one kiss between Brittany and Santana. In January 2011, several months after Brittany and Santana are seen in bed together, Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk further confirmed that \\"Brittana is on. Brittana was always on.\\" Musical performances Brittany performs in many of the series' musical numbers, though she does not have a solo line until the second season. In that season's second episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\", Brittany performs \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" as a solo and \\"Me Against the Music\\" as a duet with Santana. Songs by Morris as Brittany have been released as singles, available for digital download, and have also featured on the show's soundtrack albums. Brittany sings lead for Kesha's \\"Tik-Tok\\" in the episode \\"Blame It on the Alcohol\\". Candace Bulter of ScreenCrave praised the New Directions performance of the song and wrote, \\"Ke$ha might be able to out-drink the Glee members, but their cover of her song was phenomenal.\\" She went on to praise Brittany's choreography and voice, calling it \\"mad\\" and \\"awesome\\". Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised all of the musical performances and covers of that episode. In the season finale, she sings solo lines in the glee club's Nationals performance of the original song \\"Light Up the World\\". In the third season, Brittany's first major performance was in the third episode \\"Asian F\\", where she sings lead on Beyonc√©'s \\"Run the World (Girls)\\", which garnered superlatives from many reviewers including Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic, who wrote, \\"Brittany's performance of 'Run the World (Girls)' was thrilling. It was the most adrenaline-pumping musical number the series has produced: intricately choreographed, expertly shot and edited, perfectly woven into the story, and performed exquisitely by Heather Morris.\\" She also performs a duet with Santana on \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" in the Whitney Houston tribute episode \\"Dance With Somebody\\". Critical reception The relationship between Santana (Naya Rivera, left) and Brittany (Heather Morris, right) has been well received by critics and viewers. Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post has compared Morris as Brittany to Lynch as Sue, and noted that she has \\"emerged as one of the funniest second bananas on TV right now\\". Wieselman wrote that since her introduction, Brittany has been given \\"more and more to do [and] less and less to think\\", and that the result has been \\"one of the most clueless characters that's ever figured out how to dress herself in the morning.\\" E! Online's Megan Masters has also compared Brittany to Sue, and stated that Brittany's one-liners \\"easily rival\\" Sue's. She deemed Brittany \\"brainlessly brilliant\\", and thanked the Glee producers for creating her: \\"Never before have we had the pleasure of enjoying such a ridiculously dumb‚Äîyet always loveable‚Äîcharacter on television.\\" When a promotional clip for the episode \\"Sectionals\\" indicated that Brittany and Santana had slept together, Dorothy Snarker, when writing for lesbian entertainment website AfterEllen.com, praised the pairing and referred to it by the portmanteau \\"Brittana\\". Snarker called the two her \\"new favourite Glee pairing\\", and commented: \\"While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they‚Äôve made it count. Heather in particular has brought the laughs as the Cheerio least likely to get a Mensa invitation. Never mind Finn and Rachel ‚Äì I‚Äôm on Team Brittana now.\\" Morris' performance in Britney/Brittany attracted critical praise; Lisa de Moraes called \\"Britney/Brittany\\" a \\"great showcase\\" for the actress, and praised her \\"spectacular dance moves\\" and \\"deadpan flare\\". In her otherwise negative review, Emily VanDerWerff deemed Morris \\"hysterical throughout\\" and the cast's best dancer. She stated, \\"Murphy seems intent on running this character into the ground, but Morris isn't going to have her stop being funny without a fight.\\" Jenna Mullins of E! Online observed, \\"When Ryan Murphy said this episode was a celebration of Heather, he wasn't kidding\\", and commended her musical performances. Robert Canning of IGN was initially concerned that the episode would diminish Morris' appeal by elevating her from a background role, but was ultimately pleased that it managed to retain her \\"fan favorite\\" secondary character status. While Poniewozik asked \\"have we gotten to the point as a society where it's unremarkable that the most popular scripted TV show in the 18 to 49 demographic is also‚Äîalmost without comment or controversy‚Äîthe gayest show on broadcast TV?\\", Ann Oldenburg of USA Today questioned whether Glee had gone too far by its depiction of Brittany and Santana kissing and their reference to the sexual act called \\"scissoring\\". Christie Keith, in writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com, suggested that \\"Duets\\" was the \\"queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television\\", and stated that she was moved to tears by the final scene of Brittany forlorn without Santana. AfterEllen.com also listed her in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Robert Canning praised Morris for her performance in \\"A Very Glee Christmas\\", and wrote: \\"The heart of \\"A Very Glee Christmas\\" was found in Artie Abrams attempt to keep Brittany's belief in Santa Claus alive. Heather Morris perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa. Her interaction with the black mall Santa was a highlight. Watching Artie, and eventually the rest of the club, work to keep Brittany's belief intact was truly in the spirit of Christmas and should have been made into a fuller part of the episode. Also shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode.\\" In January 2010, Morris and her co- stars won the \\"Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Later that year, Brittany and Santana were nominated for the \\"Favorite Fictional Lesbian Couple\\" award at the AfterEllen.com Visibility Awards.

Lu might have killed him subsequently.  Seizure of Zhongwu Circuit  Little is known about Zhou Ji's background, as he did not have a biography in either of the official histories of Tang Dynasty, the Old Book of TangOld Book of Tang, Table of Contents. and the New Book of Tang.New Book of Tang, Table of Contents. As of 880, he was serving as an officer of Zhongwu Circuit, under the military governor Xue Neng (). In late 880, as part of the Tang operations to stop the northwestward advancement of the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, many circuits in the east were ordered to send troops to Yin River (Ê∫µÊ∞¥, a major branch of the Shaying River). Xue sent Zhou with Zhongwu troops there. Before Zhou got there, however, there was a disturbance at Zhongwu's capital Xu Prefecture ‚Äî as the soldiers from Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), who were undisciplined but whom Xue thought he could control (as he had previously been the military governor of Ganhua), after Xue welcomed them into the city, were instead rioting and demanding various supplies. Zhou heard about the disturbance and returned to Xu Prefecture with his troops. He then attacked the Ganhua troops and slaughtered them. Further, resenting Xue for treating the Ganhua soldiers well, he expelled Xue. Xue tried to flee to Xiangyang, but mutineer soldiers under Zhou chased him down and slaughtered him and his family. Zhou claimed the title of acting military governor. As a result of Zhou's mutiny, Qi Kerang the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), feared that Zhou would ambush him, and thus abandoned his position at Ru Prefecture (Ê±ùÂ∑û, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan) and returned to Taining, causing the various circuits' troops gathered at Yin River to also abandon their positions. This allowed Huang an open path to the Tang imperial capital Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Faced with the Huang threat, the imperial government was unable to act against Zhou and almost immediately commissioned him as the military governor of Zhongwu. Huang was thereafter able to capture both Luoyang and the imperial capital Chang'an, forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu. Meanwhile, the Zhongwu officer Qin Zongquan, whom Xue had previously sent to help defend Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), seized the prefecture. Zhou was himself unable to control Qin and therefore made him the prefect of Cai Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254.  Submission to Huang Chao and resubmission to Tang  After Huang Chao captured Chang'an around the new year 881 and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qi, Zhou Ji submitted to him. Qin Zongquan, however, refused to abide by that decision. Zhou's submission to Qi did not last long, however. At a feast that he held for the Tang eunuch general Yang Fuguang, Yang persuaded him that righteousness required that he return to the Tang fold. They poured wine on the ground and swore over the wine. Yang further strengthened Zhou's resolve by having his adoptive son Yang Shouliang assassinate the Qi emissaries then at Zhongwu. Yang Fuguang subsequently gathered 8,000 soldiers from Zhongwu and divided them into eight corps, commanded by the officers Lu Yanhong, Jin Hui (), Wang Jian, Han Jian, Zhang Zao (), Li Shitai (), and Pang Cong (), and took them on the campaign against Huang. After Tang forces successfully forced Huang into abandoning Chang'an in early 883, Huang fled east and put Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, in modern Zhoukou, Henan) under siege in late 883. Chen's prefect Zhao Chou sought aid from the nearby military governors. Zhou, along with Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua and Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), all sent aid, but their forces together were not able to defeat Huang. They thus sought aid from one of the main contributors of the Tang campaign to recapture Chang'an, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li Keyong did come to their aid and defeated Huang repeatedly, causing Huang to lift the siege on Chen Prefecture and flee further, but subsequent had a falling out with Zhu over Zhu's attempt to assassinate him. When Li Keyong sought food supplies from Zhou, Zhou claimed that he did not have adequate supplies himself, and Li Keyong left the region.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.  Defeat by Lu Yanhong  Meanwhile, Lu Yanhong, after Yang Fuguang's death in 883, had taken his troops and become a roving marauder, raiding through Shannan East (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and Shannan West (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) Circuits, despite the imperial government's attempt to appease him by making him the acting military governor of Shannan West. In fall 884, Lu advanced east and rendezvoused with two officers under Qin Zongquan (who had himself become a renegade to Tang by that point), Qin Gao () and Zhao Deyin, to siege Shannan East's capital Xiang Prefecture (). After capturing Xiang Prefecture, Lu raided parts of Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) and Huainan (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) Circuits and then headed for Xu Prefecture. Hearing of Lu's impending attack, Zhou Ji abandoned Zhongwu and fled. Lu took over Xu Prefecture and claimed the title of acting military governor; the imperial government, unable to stop him, subsequently commissioned him military governor. That was the last historical reference to Zhou, and it is not completely known what happened to him afterwardsZizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. ‚Äî although both the chronicles of Emperor Xizong's reign in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that Lu killed him.Old Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 2.New Book of Tang, vol. 9.

It was noted by motorcycle journalists in the United States and the United Kingdom for being powerful, responsive, and comfortable. It was one of the heaviest and most expensive motor scooters with typical styling and engineering of its time, and comparable to other manufacturers' products such as Heinkel Tourist, Z√ºndapp Bella and the British Triumph Tigress and BSA Sunbeam. The Maicoletta was highly regarded in the United Kingdom. When Maico stopped making the Maicoletta, the U.K. importer built more of them from its spare parts inventory. The two-stroke engine of the Maicoletta used an unusual starter that rocked the crankshaft back and forth before firing instead of rotating it. History The Maicoletta was introduced in 1955. It used components based on those used in Maico's conventional motorcycles, including the engine, transmission, and front forks. It was built to compete in the German scooter market of the 1950s. Maico had earlier introduced an enclosed motorcycle with superior weather protection for the rider, the Maico Mobil, that was marketed as a \\"two-wheeled car\\" with interchangeable wheels and a spare wheel mounted into the barrel shaped bodywork behind the number plate and rear lamp. The Maicoletta used the fourteen-inch wheels, gear ratio indicator, and headlights from the Mobil. When the Maicoletta was first exported to the United Kingdom, it was one of the heaviest and most expensive scooters sold there. Though known as the ‚Äúdustbin‚Äù amongst British scooterists with Italianate tastes,Hebdige, Dick (2004) [1988]. Hiding in the Light ‚Äì On Images and Things. Taylor & Francis eLibrary, p. 104. it gained a reputation in the U.K. as a high-quality, heavy, powerful, scooter capable of being ridden in comfort over long distances. The brakes were noted at the time by Motor Cycling and Scooter Weekly for being powerful and progressive in that the braking force increased with increased effort against the braking controls. The optional 277 cc engine was considered particularly useful with a sidecar combination, as was the steering damper. Maico stopped offering the 174 cc and 277 cc engine options in 1962 and ended production of the Maicoletta in 1966. Demand for Maicolettas in the U.K. was such that the importer used its inventory of spare parts to build new Maicolettas to special order until late 1967. Specifications =Frame and suspension= The Maicoletta had a tubular steel frame with pressed steel body panels. Front suspension was with a telescopic fork with coil springs, hydraulic damping, and a steering damper. Rear suspension was with a swingarm with dual coil springs and twin hydraulic dampers. The wheels were 14 inches in diameter and had a width between 3.25 inches and 3.5 inches. Drum brakes were used front and rear. The front drums were 6.5 inches in diameter, while the rear brake was either six inches or five inches in diameter. =Drivetrain= The Maicoletta had a fan-cooled single-cylinder piston port two-stroke engine, originally of either 174 cc or 247 cc. A 277 cc engine became available in 1957. The transmission had four ratios and was controlled by a heel-and-toe pedal. The engine and transmission were mounted on the frame and drove the rear wheel through an enclosed drive chain. Pendulum starter The Maicoletta used a Bosch six volt 'pendulum' electric starter system. When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft, the starter used the generator coils on the shaft to rock it back and forth under the control of cams on the crankshaft. These cams closed contacts in the starter to trigger a reversing switch in the control box that changed the crankshaft direction at the end of each swing. This gives the impression of the crankshaft continually bouncing back and forwards against compression, when operated. A separate set of ignition points fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter is released and the normal ignition system takes over. This system was possible due to the piston port induction system of the two-stroke engine. The advantage of this system is that the starter does not have to force the crankshaft to turn over against compression, so less power is required from the 6 volt system. Its disadvantage is the unusually large number of contacts, which can be difficult to adjust. The reversing switch contacts tend to wear out with extended use and can be very difficult to service or to have serviced, hence the scooter's reputation for requiring roll starts later in life. The Maicoletta did not have a kick starter. =Ergonomics= The Maicoletta was noted for being large and comfortable, with an exceptionally large and commodious dual seat and room for the rider and passenger to move around and avoid fatigue. Maicoletta Dash The Maicoletta had a dashboard with a speedometer and an eight-day clock. A gear ratio indicator was incorporated in the speedometer. The drivetrain was covered by the rear bodywork, which could be removed as a unit by loosening one bolt and unplugging the lead to the taillight. Access to the fuel cap and the spark plug was also available by unlocking and lifting the hinged seat, and an access panel on the left side allowed access to the carburettor. One ergonomic concern was the considerable effort required to mount the Maicoletta on its centre stand. This made it difficult for small riders or riders of slight build to park the scooter. Another concern was the cold-start lever, which was positioned below the glove box and was not readily visible.

It produces mushrooms with pinkish-cinnamon caps up to wide held by pinkish-white stems up to long. The closely spaced whitish to pinkish buff gills develop wine-red spots in age. When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white latex that rapidly turns bright sulfur-yellow. The species, common and widely distributed in North America, grows in the ground in association with conifer trees. There are several other Lactarius species that bear resemblance to L. vinaceorufescens, but most can be distinguished by differences in staining reactions, macroscopic characteristics, or habitat. Taxonomy and classification The species was first described by American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in 1960, based on specimens collected in Muskegon, Michigan in 1936. In the same publication, they also named the variety Lactarius vinaceorufescens var. fallax to account for individuals with prominently projecting pleurocystidia measuring 9‚Äì12 ¬µm broad, but they reduced this to synonymy with the main species in their 1979 monograph of North American Lactarius species.Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 317‚Äì19. The fungus is classified in the subsection Croceini of the subgenus Piperates in the genus Lactarius, along with other species with latex that stains the fruit body tissue yellow, or with latex that slowly become yellow upon exposure to air.Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 304‚Äì5. The specific epithet vinaceorufescens is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"becoming wine reddish\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"yellow-latex milky\\" or the \\"yellow-staining milkcap\\". Description The latex rapidly turns yellow upon exposure to air. The cap of L. vinaceorufescens is initially convex, then becomes broadly convex to nearly flat, and reaches diameters of wide. The cap margin is rolled inwards at first, but later expands, becoming somewhat uplifted and uneven with age. The cap surface is smooth, pale pinkish cinnamon with pinkish buff at the margin when young, becoming darker pinkish cinnamon to orangey cinnamon when older, faintly zoned with bands or water spots of nearly the same color. The gills are attached to slightly decurrent, narrow, close together, and often forked near the stem. There are several tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not fully extend to the stem from the cap margin). The gills are initially whitish to pinkish buff, later spotting wine red (vinaceous) to pinkish brown or dark reddish brown. The latex that is exuded when the mushroom is cut or injured is initially white, but rapidly turns sulfur-yellow. The stem is long by thick, nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged slightly downward, and hollow. The stem surface is nearly smooth, with white to brownish stiff hairs at the base, pinkish-white overall, and darkening with age. The flesh is moderately thick, white to pinkish, staining bright sulfur yellow. It has an acrid taste. The spore print is white to yellowish. The mushrooms are poisonous; as a general rule, several guide books recommend to avoid the consumption of Lactarius species with latex that turns yellow. The spores are roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), amyloid, and measure 6.5‚Äì9 by 6‚Äì7 ¬µm. They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial reticulum, with prominences up to 0.8 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 28‚Äì33 by 8‚Äì10 ¬µm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill faces) are roughly cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped when they are young, but soon broaden in the mid portion and taper to an abrupt point; they reach dimensions of 40‚Äì68 (up to 80 ¬µm) by 9‚Äì13 ¬µm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are roughly club-shaped or ventricose with acute apices, and measure 32‚Äì44 by 6‚Äì10 ¬µm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae. The cap cuticle is a thin ixocutis composed of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 2‚Äì4 ¬µm wide. Projecting out from the cuticle surface are the ends of numerous connective hyphae, about 5‚Äì15 ¬µm long. Similar species Lactarius chrysorrheus also produces yellow latex. Lactarius xanthogalactus has nearly identical microscopic features to L. vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, it does not have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L. vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L. colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L. vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L. chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown. Other superficially similar species include L. rubrilacteus, L. rufus, L. subviscidus, L. fragilis and L. rufulus, but none of these species have the yellow staining reaction characteristic of L. vinaceorufescens. The edible species Lactarius helvus has an orange-brown to light grayish-brown cap with thin bands of dark grayish-brown, a watery latex, and whitish to tan flesh with an odor resembling maple sugar or burnt sugar. Lactarius theiogalus, the \\"sulfur-milk Lactarius\\", has an oranger cap and white latex that slowly changes yellow upon exposure to air; it is typically found in broadleaf and mixed woods. Habitat and distribution The foreground specimen has stiff white hairs at the base of the stem. The fruit bodies of Lactarius vinaceorufescens grow scattered or in groups on the ground under pine between August and October. The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It is a fairly common and widely distributed species in North America. The mushroom has been found in boreal forests and high-elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians, associated with the tree genera Picea, Abies, and Pinus. In California, it has been noted to commonly co-occur with L. fragilis, L. rubrilacteus, Russula emetica, and R. cremoricolor.

K, 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, in uniform and wrapped with hospital blanket The 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised in North Carolina for service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The 18th Infantry Regiment, formerly the 8th Volunteers, was organized at Camp Wyatt, near Carolina Beach, North Carolina, in July, 1861. Its members were from Wilmington and the counties of Robeson, New Hanover, Bladen, Columbus, and Richmond. It moved to South Carolina, returned to North Carolina, then in the spring of 1862 proceeded to Virginia. The 18th served in General Branch's and Lane's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. After fighting at Hanover Court House, it participated in various conflicts of the army from the Seven Days' Battles to Cold Harbor. It continued the fight in the trenches of Petersburg south of the James River and ended the war at Appomattox. This unit was organized with 1,100 men, lost fifty-seven percent of the 396 engaged during the Seven Days' Battles, and reported 14 casualties at Cedar Mountain and 12 at Second Manassas. There were 13 killed and 77 wounded at Fredericksburg and 30 killed and 96 wounded at Chancellorsville. Of the 346 in action at Gettysburg, about twenty-five percent were disabled. It surrendered 11 officers and 73 men at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, including Major Thomas J. Wooten and captains Benjamin F. Rinaldi and John J. Poisson. The field officers were Colonels John D. Barry, Robert H. Cowan, Thomas J. Purdie, and James D. Radcliffe; Lieutenant Colonels Forney George, John W. McGill, and Oliver P. Meares; and Majors George Tait and Thomas J. Wooten. The 18th North Carolina was also responsible for the accidental shooting of Stonewall Jackson during the battle of Chancellorsville. The next day, May 3rd, 1863, their battle flag would be captured. Just over a year later, on May 12, 1864, they lost another battle flag to Alexander H. Mitchell of the 105th Pennsylvania Infantry. Mitchell would later be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

Dystonia and choreoathetosis are the two most dominant movement disorders in patients with DCP.  Prevalence  Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the second most common subtype of cerebral palsy, after spastic CP. A European Cerebral Palsy study reported a rate of 14,4% of patients with DCP which is similar to the rate of 15% reported in Sweden. The rate appeared lower in Australia, where data from states with full population-based ascertainment listed DCP as the predominant motor type in only 7% of the cases. The differences reported from various registers and countries may relate to under- identification of dyskinetic CP due to a lack of standardization in definition and classification based on predominant type.  Causes  Dyskinetic cerebral palsy could have multiple causes. The majority of the children are born at term and experience perinatal adverse events which can be supported by neuroimaging. Possible causes are perinatal hypoxic-ischaemia and neonatal shock in children born at term or near term. Hyperbilirubinaemia used to be a common contributing factor, but is now rare in high-income countries due to preventive actions. Other aetiological factors are growth retardation, brain maldevelopment, intracranial haemorrhage, stroke or cerebral infections.  Medical Imaging  Multiple classification systems using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been developed, linking brain lesions to time of birth, cerebral palsy subtype and functional ability. The overall goal of these studies is to elucidate etiology, timing of injury and pathogenesis of cerebral palsy. Around 70% of patients with DCP show lesions in the cortical and deep grey matter of the brain, more specifically in the basal ganglia and thalamus. However, other brain lesions and even normal-appearing MRI findings can occur, for example white matter lesions and brain maldevelopments. Patients with pure basal ganglia and thalamus lesions are more likely to show more severe choreoathetosis whereas dystonia may be associated with other brain lesions, such as the cerebellum. These lesions occur mostly during the peri- and postnatal period since these regions have a high vulnerability during the late third trimester of the pregnancy. Unfortunately, contemporary imaging is not sophisticated enough to detect all subtle brain deformities and network disorders in dystonia. Research with more refined imaging techniques including diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI is required.  Clinical Presentation  In dyskinetic cerebral palsy, both motor and non-motor impairments are present. Motor impairments, such as impaired muscle tone regulations, lack of muscle control and bone deformations are often more severe compared to the other subtypes of CP. Non-motor impairments increase with motor severity. Half of the DCP group shows severe learning disabilities, 51% has epilepsy. Hearing and visual impairments occur frequently, respectively 11% and 45%. Dysarthria or anarthria are also common, so alternative and augmentative communication tools are needed. = Dystonia and choreoathetosis = Dystonia and choreoathetosis mostly occur concurrently in DCP, but they are two independent motor disorders with their own characteristics. Dystonia predominates in most patients. Dystonia (DYS) is defined by twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures due to sustained muscle contractions, and hypertonia. Dystonia is aggravated by voluntary movements and postures, or with stress, emotion or pain. A video of dystonia in a patient with dyskinetic cerebral palsy can be seen here: Choreoathetosis (CA) is characterized by hyperkinesia (chorea i.e. rapid involuntary, jerky, often fragmented movements) and hypokinesia (athetosis i.e. slower, constantly changing, writhing or contorting movements). A video of choreoathetosis in a patient with dyskinetic cerebral palsy can be seen here: = Clinical patterns = Patients with DCP are more likely to obtain a high level of functional disability. Respectively 12,7% and 49% of the patients were assigned in level IV and V of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). The same trend appeared in manual ability with 21,8% in level IV and 43,6% in level V of the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS). A good correlation between the functional classification scales and the total dystonia level was found, meaning that a higher level of functional disability correlates with a higher dystonia level. The same study showed no associations with choreoathetosis. These results suggest that dystonia typically has a bigger impact on functionality and a larger effect on activity, participation and quality of life than choreoathetosis. As previously mentioned, dystonia predominates in most patients, partly because dystonia is often more noticeable and severe than choreoathetosis. Both increase with activity and are generalized over all body regions with a higher severity in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs. Dystonia has a significantly higher level of severity in the distal parts of the extremities, whereas choreoathetosis is more equally distributed.  Management  = Measurement = Measuring dystonia and choreoathetosis can be very challenging. It is however crucial to have reliable measurements for the evaluation and effects of targeted management. So far, measurements involved the usage of clinical qualitative assessment scales judged by video observation. The Barry-Albright Dystonia Rating Scale (BADS), the Burke-Fahn- Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMS) and the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS) are most commonly used. The BADS was developed and validated to assess secondary dystonia in patients with CP. The BFMS has been validated for use in primary dystonia and is clinically the most used scale in both primary and secondary dystonia. Both the BADS and BFMS do not include scoring for choreoathetosis. The DIS is currently stated as the most sensitive, valid and reliable scale. It has been validated for use in secondary dystonia, as it occurs in patients with DCP. The value lays in its detailed full-body consideration and the differentiation action-rest, proximal-distal limb and duration-amplitude. Moreover, the DIS includes both the evaluation of dystonia and choreoathetosis. Although this scale is currently seen as the gold standard to evaluate patients with DCP in research, substantial time and experience with the current CA and DYS definitions is needed from the rater in scoring dystonia and choreoathetosis. Both the DIS and BFMS can be used as outcome measure in intervention studies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) or intrathecal baclofen. = Aim of treatment interventions = Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a non-progressive, non-reversible disease. The current management is symptomatic, since there is no cure. The main goal is to improve daily activity, quality of life and autonomy of the children by creating a timed and targeted management. The many management options for patients with DCP are not appropriate as standalone treatment but must be seen within an individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. =Prevention= Prevention strategies have been developed for the different risk factors of the specific cerebral palsy subtypes. Primary prevention consists of reducing the possible risk factors. However, when multiple risk factors cluster together, prevention is much more difficult. Secondary preventions may be more appropriate at that time, e.g. prevention of prematurity. Studies showed a reduced risk of cerebral palsy when administering magnesium sulfate to women at risk of preterm delivery. Cooling or therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours immediately after birth has a significant clinical effect on reducing mortality and severity of neurodevelopmental disabilities in neonates with birth asphyxia. This has been documented for newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. =Medical and rehabilitation interventions= Management options can be subdivided into medical treatment and rehabilitation interventions. Medical treatment consists of oral medication and surgery. Before using oral drugs, it is important to differentiate between spasticity, dystonia and choreoathetosis since each motor disorder has a specific approach. In general, many oral drugs have low efficacy, unwanted side-effects and variable effects. Oral baclofen and trihexyphenidyl are commonly used to decrease dystonia, although its efficacy is relatively low in most patients. Adverse effects of the latter can include worsening of choreoathetosis. Since dystonia predominates over choreoathetosis in most patients, reducing dystonia allows the possibility of a full expression of choreoathetosis. This suggests that the discrimination of dystonia and choreoathetosis is crucial, since misinterpretations in diagnosing can contribute to the administration of inappropriate medication, causing unwanted effects. Intrathecal baclofen pump (ITB) is often used as an alternative to reduce side-effects of the oral dystonic medication over the whole body and botulinum toxin injections are applied to decrease dystonia in specific muscles or muscle groups. Research on the effects of ITB and botulinum toxin on choreoathetosis is lacking. Regarding surgical treatment in patients with DCP, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown to decrease dystonia. However, the responsiveness is less beneficial and the effects are more variable than in patients with inherited or primary dystonia. The effects on choreoathetosis have not been investigated. Orthopedic surgery is performed to correct musculoskeletal deformities, but it is recommended that all other alternatives are considered first. The previous management options need to be combined with rehabilitation programs, adapted to the specific needs of each individual. Unfortunately, evidence for rehabilitation strategies is scarce and is based on clinical expertise. The team of caregivers can consist of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech/communication therapists. The therapy mainly focusses on the motor problems by using principles of neuroplasticity, patterning, postural balance, muscle strengthening and stretching. Non-motor impairments such as epilepsy require specific treatment.

Location The Nankang Software Park is located on east side of Taipei City. The park is accessible by three highways, one expressway, two MRT lines, the train, five commuter buses, and more than 30 public bus lines. There are several restaurants and public art works located in the park. The park is open to the public, but access badges are required for the office floors. Overview NKSP was designed by the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), a division of Taiwan‚Äôs Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Century Development Corporation. The Software Park was developed three phases. Phase I of the Software Park was completed in October 1999. Phase I consists of five connected buildings with 187,334 m2 of floor space on 3.97 hectares of land. IBM, TECO, Tradevan, NXP, and YAO5DX are a few of the 107 companies located in Phase I. Phase II was completed in September 2003 with 252,525 m2 of floor space on 4.18 hectares of land. Siemens Medical, HSBC, Sony, AMD, and two Biotech Incubator Facilities are located in Phase II. Phase III was completed in August 2008, and has 171,500 m2 of floor space on 1.52 hectares of land. This Phase is home to one of the Asian Headquarters for Hewlett-Packard, the Greater China Headquarters of Yahoo, the Microsoft Innovation Center, Asia Pacific Telecom, Alcor Semiconductor, TDK-Epcos, Freescale Semiconductor, IBM, Intel, ASE (USI), A10 Networks, and several other technology firms. Nankang Software Park, Phase III Distinctions Wired Magazine profiled the Nankang Software Park in 2000, when it named Taipei City the Number 1 Digital City in Asia (No. 8 in the World). In the article, it sited NKSP as one of the primary reasons for Taipei City's strong rating. The Software Park has also been profiled in Harvard Business Review, Scientific American, and Business Today (Taiwan). In 2005, the Nankang Software Park was named one of the three Intelligent Buildings of the Year by the Intelligence Community Forum (New York, NY, USA). In 2008, the Economist Intelligent Unit ranked the Nankang Software Park as the top rated software park across four categories among a select group of Asian Software Parks. NKSP is highly regarded for the annual production it adds to the economy each year, the strength of the companies in its incubator centers, and the mixture of local and international clients. In 2007, the park contributed around US$6 billion in production annually and employed approximately 14,000 people. It is estimated that with the inclusion of Phase III the Park's production will increase to approximately US$28 billion and employ over 28,000 technology workers. The Nankang Software Park, Neihu Technology Park, and the Hsinchu Science Park are often credited for being the catalyst in the development of Taiwan's high tech industries and the dramatic increase in Taiwan's share of intellectual property. The Nankang Software Park, Neihu Technology Park, and greater Xizhi Economic and Trade Park also create the Taipei tech triangle as they house many of Taiwan's top tech corporate headquarters. Difficulties and challenges The Nari Typhoon brought flooding to large portions of Taipei City including the Nankang Software Park in 2001. During that flood, some of the electrical systems in the basement of the Software Park were damaged. The Taipei City Government has built a large pumping station in along the Jilong River to reduce the risk of flooding. Phase I was retrofitted with flood gates to help reduce the risk of future flooding. In addition, new sections of the park have been designed with protection above the 200-year flood line.  How to Get There  To arrive at the Nankang Software Park take Bannan Line to Nangang Exhibition Center Station and transfer to Wenhu Line, the second stop will be Nangang Software Park Station.

It was established by law on 22 September 1933 in the course of the Gleichschaltung process at the instigation of Reich Minister Joseph Goebbels as a professional organization of all German creative artists. Defying the competing ambitions of the German Labour Front (DAF) under Goebbels' rival Robert Ley, it was meant to gain control over the entire cultural life in Germany creating and promoting Aryan art consistent with Nazi ideals. Every artist had to apply for membership on presentation of an Aryan certificate. A rejected inscription de facto resulted in an occupational ban.  Structure and organisation  The RKK was affiliated with the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda with its seat on Wilhelmplatz in Berlin. Headed by Goebbels himself, a state secretary of his ministry served as vice president: Reich Chamber of Music decree to the Berlin musician Werner Liebenthal dictating the immediate cessation of his professional activity. *Walther Funk (1933‚Äì1938) *Karl Hanke (1938‚Äì1941) *Leopold Gutterer (1941‚Äì1944) *Werner Naumann (1944‚Äì1945) SS officer Hans Hinkel was one of the officers in charge of the chamber and Goebbels' special commissioner for the removal of Jews from German cultural life. Different subdivisions of the RKK dealt with film, music, visual arts, theatre, literature, media, and radio, organized in seven departments: *Reichsfilmkammer, headed by Carl Froelich from 1939 *Reichsmusikkammer, headed by Richard Strauss, from 1935 by Peter Raabe *Reichskammer der bildenden K√ºnste (\\"Reich Chamber of Fine Arts\\") (de), headed by Eugen H√∂nig from 1933, by Adolf Ziegler from 1936, and by Wilhelm Kreis from 1943 *Reichstheaterkammer, headed by Rainer Schl√∂sser 1935‚Äì1938, by Paul Hartmann from 1942 *Reichsschrifttumskammer, headed by Hans-Friedrich Blunck, from 1935 by Hanns Johst *Reichspressekammer, headed by Max Amann *Reichsrundfunkkammer (tasks assigned to Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft in 1939) The RKK was ultimately dissolved and its assets confiscated by Law no. 2 (October 10, 1945) of the Allied Control Council. Footage and archives material are kept by the German Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) and the Berlin Document Center.  Degenerate art  Goebbels visits the 1938 Entartete Kunst exhibition in Berlin The RKK played a significant role in the Nazi oppression of Modern art, defamed as \\"Cultural Bolshevism\\". One notable project of the Bildende K√ºnste (Fine Arts) division under Adolf Ziegler was the Entartete Kunst exhibition, of works deemed \\"degenerate.\\" Opened in July 1937 at the Hofgarten in Munich, touring exhibitions were held from 1938 to 1941 in several major German cities such as Berlin, Leipzig, D√ºsseldorf, Salzburg, and Hamburg. Attendance was measured in the millions (perhaps largely because entrance was free), and the so-called degenerate art may have been more popular with the public than the Nazis anticipated. Goebbels had supported German expressionists until Hitler intervened and expressed his disgust at artists such as Max Liebermann and Emil Nolde.

The Genoese delegated Otto to go to his camp and remind him of his duty to his allies: > They sent Oto de Bonovillano as a legate to the Emperor who was at Baeza. > The Emperor had already dismissed his army and did not have any more than > 400 knights and 1000 foot soldiers. When he heard that the Genoese fleet had > arrived, the Emperor regretted that he just dismissed his army. He said he > would come, but he took his time.This passage from Cafarus‚Äô account is the > only one to name the head of the Genoese legation, which is mentioned, > almost as an aside, in the Poema de Almer√≠a, composed for the > Castilian‚ÄìLeonese aristocracy. The city fell, after the king's arrival, on 17 October and Alfonso invested the Genoese a third of the city as per their prior agreement. On 11 November the republic leased out its third for a period of thirty years to Otto, who had played such a prominent r√¥le in the negotiations and the conquest, who in turn swore fealty to Genoa and agreed to pay the city a small sum annually.Williams (1997): 38. He also swore to keep an army of three hundred in the city at all times and not to charge any tolls on traders from Liguria.Steven A. Epstein, Genoa and the Genoese, 958‚Äì1528 (UNC Press, 2001): 51. Otto is the first example of a private citizen of Genoa holding the republic's territory for it as a vassal. This was the initial, indirect way in which Genoa managed its overseas dependencies. After the Genoese fleet sailed, taking with it the plunder to pay off the republic's war debt, Otto was left to guard the city with a thousand men, \\"which he did\\", in the words of Cafarus. The discrepancy between contemporary documents in the number of troops left with Otto, and reference to the agreement between Alfonso and Genoa of 1146, suggests that the Almer√≠a may have been ruled as a condominium in accordance with the original agreement.Bernard F. Reilly, The Kingdom of Le√≥n‚ÄìCastilla under King Alfonso VII, 1126‚Äì1157 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998): 100. In the grant to Otto, the consuls of Genoa stressed their government of the city as being both honoring to God, Christendom and Genoa: > The consuls have made this grant because they have captured the city of > Almer√≠a for the honour of God and of all Christianity and they have > determined to remain in control of the city out of the greatest necessity of > Christians, and most of all because they know that it is honorable and > useful to the city of Genoa.Recorded in the Libri iurium, doc. 94: Hanc vero > laudem isti consules fecerunt quoniam ad honorem Dei et tocius > Christianitatis civitatem Almarie ceperunt et summa necessitate > Christianorum eam retinere decreverunt et maxime quia cognoverunt hoc esse > honorem et utilitatem comunis Ianue, quoted in Williams (1997): 38n. Otto remained in Spain for several more years as governor of the Genoese quarter of Almer√≠a, and acquired territory in the region. The castle of Albuher (Villamanrique de Tajo), acquired by Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera from the king on 18 November 1153, was granted by him to Otto some years later.Simon Barton, The Aristocracy in Twelfth-Century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997): 172.

Each episode depicts a person who has a high management position at a major business, deciding to become undercover as an entry-level employee to discover the faults in the company. The first series, consisting of two episodes was aired in 2009 followed by a second series consisting of six episodes one year later. This original series sparked the Undercover Boss franchise. Localised versions of the show format are currently being produced in the United States, France, Australia, Germany and Canada.  Production  Each episode features a high- positioned executive or the owner of a corporation going undercover as an entry-level employee in their own company. The executive changes their appearance and assumes an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation for the accompanying camera crew is that the executive is being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of the company's operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. The boss is exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results. They invariably spend time getting to know the people who work in the company, learning about their professional and personal challenges. At the end of their week undercover, the boss returns to their true identity and requests the employees he worked with individually to corporate headquarters. The boss reveals their identity and rewards hardworking employees through campaign, promotion or financial rewards. Other employees are given training or better working conditions. Stephen Lambert says he got the idea for the show after hearing suggestions that Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways, might have been able to avoid the problems of the difficult opening of Heathrow airport's Terminal 5 in 2008, if he had worked anonymously and experienced the basic functions of the workplace. The show's producers do admit that participants know in advance that cameras are on the way, but that they do not know the real premise of the show.  Episodes  The first series of Undercover Boss was broadcast in 2009 and consisted of two episodes. A second series was commissioned and was aired in 2010 featuring seven episodes, six with new companies and a return visit to the business where it all started to see what impact the show had in the longer term.

In ancient Greek drama, the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe. As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist. Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, they occasion the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.M√ºller, Karl Otfried, and John William Donaldson. A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece, 1858 History The part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama. Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener. As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the bass range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone).A History of Theatrical Art, Mantzius (1903). Cicero, in his Divinatio in Caecilium, reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.Divinatio in Caecilium, Cicero, s. 45. Notable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator Aeschines, who was held by Demosthenes to have been untalented as a tritagonist, and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright Aeschylus. In some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.

Initially, those jarliq came from the qaghan in Karakorum, but after Batu established the khanate of the Golden Horde (), they came from Sarai. None of these jarliq, however, is extant. In the mid-fifteenth century, Grand Duke Basil II of Moscow began forbidding other Rus princes from receiving the jarliq from Mongol khans, thus establishing the right of the Moscow grand prince to authorize local princely rule. Mongol leaders gave the jarliq to emissaries, travelers, monks and merchants to give them free passage, exemptions from taxes and imposts and security.Enerelt Enkhbold (2019) The role of the ortoq in the Mongol Empire in forming business partnerships, Central Asian Survey, DOI: 10.1080/02634937.2019.1652799 Kublai Khan began the practice of having the four great aristocrats in his kheshig sign all jarliqs (decrees), a practice that spread to all other Mongol khanates in 1280. Ghazan reformed the issuance of jarliqs (edicts), creating set forms and graded seals, ordering that all jarliqs be kept on file at court in Persia. Jarliqs older than 30 years were to be cancelled, along with old paizas (Mongol seals of authority). Even after 1260, the Yuan Dynasty in China still considered jarlig must be issued by only Qa'an/Khagan (Emperor) but linkji by khans (princes) of three western khanates.Reuven Amitai, Michal Biran Mongols, Turks, and others: Eurasian nomads and the sedentary world, p. 342 However, some high-ranking officials continued to issue jarligs under the name of a khan or Emperor in Central Asia.Dai Mastui \\"A Mongolian Decree from the Chaghataid Khanate Discovered at Dunhuang\\", in: P. Zieme (ed.), Aspects of Research into Central Asian Buddhism: In Memoriam K≈çgi Kudara, Turnhout (Belgium), Brepols, 2008, pp. 160 The Rus' metropolitan archive preserves six jarliq (constituting the so-called Short Collection) considered to be translations into Russian of authentic patents issued from the Qipchaq Khanate: # from Khan Tiuliak (Tulunbek) of Mamai's Horde to Metropolitan Mikhail (Mitia) (1379) # from Khatun Taydula to the Rus' princes (1347) # from Khan Mengu-Timur to Metropolitan Peter (1308) # from Khatun Taydula to Metropolitan Feognost (1343) # from Khan Berdibeg to Metropolitan Alexius (Alexei) (1357) # from Khatun Taydula to Metropolitan Alexius (1354) A seventh jarliq, which purports to be from Khan √ñzbeg to Metropolitan Peter (found in the so-called full collection) has been determined to be a sixteenth-century forgery. The jarliq to the metropolitans affirm the freedom of the Church from taxes and tributes, and declare that the Church's property should be protected from expropriation or damage as long as Rus' churchmen pray for the well-being of the khan and his family.

It was established on 30 June 1960 to train replacement aircrew and maintenance personnel. It was disestablished on 1 November 1993. Insignia The only insignia for VP-31 was approved on 25 July 1962, and was selected to represent the Anti-surmarine warfare (ASW) training program used to educate patrol squadron aircrew of FAW-14. The central figure of the design was a submarine at the focal point of four beams from on high. Above the submarine was a magic lamp from which issued a wisp of smoke. The lamp signified the squadron's original nickname, the Genies. The design was circular, with a scroll at the bottom containing the designation Patrol Squadron Thirty One. Colors: outline of design, lamp and beams, silver and gold; lamp and submarine trim, red; central portion of beams, cream; background of design and submarine, deep blue. The squadron's nickname was Genies from 1962‚Äì1971 and Black Lightnings from 1971‚Äì1993. History P5M-2 in 1962 SHU-16B at NAS North Island in the 1960s P-3A dropping a torpedo VP-31 P-3s over the Golden Gate Bridge in 1989 *30 June 1960: VP-31 was established at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. The primary mission of the squadron was training replacement aircrew and maintenance personnel for all Pacific Fleet patrol squadrons, administrative control of the sonobuoy buildup shop and all class D maintenance for all patrol squadrons on North Island. Limited training was begun soon after the squadron's establishment, but it was not until the fall of 1960 that a complete staff of 20 officers and 300 enlisted personnel were engaged in full-scale training operations with an inventory of two P2V-5FS Neptunes, two P2V-7S, and one R5D Skymaster. *November 1961: The squadron's responsibilities were expanded to include training foreign personnel transitioning to the P2V-7. Seventy-two members of the No. 10 Squadron RAAF were among the first foreign students to be assigned for training in this aircraft. Two UF-1s seaplanes were assigned to VP-31 and converted to ASW specifications for training air force personnel from Norway, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Spain. *4 January 1963: VP-31 Detachment Alpha was established at Naval Air Station Moffett Field Its primary mission was to train pilots and aircrewmen for the advanced ASW aircraft, the P-3 Orion. The squadron's P-3 aircraft averaged 8,600 flying hours a year in training missions. *8 January 1966: VP-31 Detachment Alpha moved from Hangar Three into historic Hangar One at NAS Moffett Field. Hangar One, now a Naval Memorial site, was built in April 1933 as a home for the Navy's largest dirigibles, her sister ship, . The vast structure provided much needed space for the constantly expanding operations of the squadron. *20 May 1966, Aircraft, RP7 an SP2H out of Nas North Island ran out of fuel and ditched in the ocean a few hundred yards from a Coast Guard Cutter. The Coast guard was training a number of Stewardesses at the time who thought the Navy staged the ditching for their benefit. They were dispatched with the rescue team to retrieve the crew all of whom got out unharmed. When a crewman was asked what he thought when he looked up and saw these beautiful girls in the rescue boat he responded \\"what do you think I thought? I thought I died and went to heaven\\". It was later discovered the crew had switched the engines to empty tanks which caused the engines to all fail. Coincidentally, another aircraft from VP-31 Moffet Field P-3 also marked RP7 went down with all lives lost see below 6 March 1969 *1 July 1966: Detachment Alpha at NAS Moffett Field, was renamed Detachment Moffett. The parent squadron remained at NAS North Island. *1 January 1967: Detachment Moffett became the parent element of VP-31, and the unit at North Island became Detachment North Island. This changed occurred to accommodate the increasing numbers of students receiving training on the P-3 airframe. Detachment North Island discontinued training on the P-5 Marlin when the Navy ceased seaplane operations in 1967, but continued to provide training to crews on the P-2 Neptunes until its disestablishment in 1970. *6 March 1969: All six crewmembers of the squadron's P-3A, BuNo. 152765, RP-07 died when it crashed at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, at the end of a practice ground control approach (GCA) landing. *1 January 1970: VP-31's Detachment North Island was disestablished, having trained over 2,000 pilots, 700 Naval Flight Officers, and 10,600 aircrewmen/maintenance personnel. *7 July 1971: VP-31 received CNO approval for the P-3A/B Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Program (FRAMP), designed to train aircrew and ground personnel in the transition from older model P-3 Orions to the newer versions. *26 May 1972: A VP-31 P-3A, BuNo. 152155, failed to return to NAS Moffett Field at the completion of a routine training flight. Search operations by Navy, Army, Air Force and Civil Air Patrol aircraft continued for seven days, but no trace of the missing aircraft was ever found. Two crewmen, three personnel under instruction and three observers were listed as missing and presumed dead. *June 1974: VP-31 was tasked with training Iranian Navy aircrews on the specially configured version of the Orion, the P-3F, that would be used by that country's military for maritime patrol. Flight training/familiarization was completed in December, with all aspects of the support/maintenance training syllabus completed by 6 June 1975. *January 1984: VP-31 began the transition of Pacific Fleet patrol squadrons to the P-3 aircraft with enhanced avionics configurations. In one 15-month period, the squadron received 22 aircraft for extensive avionics modifications. In the years following, VP-31 averaged 16 to 18 Orion modifications every 12 months. *1 November 1993: VP-31 was disestablished due to the closure of NAS Moffett Field and the consolidation of training resources into one VP training squadron, VP-30, based at NAS Jacksonville, Florida.

Retrieved on September 29, 2010.\\"Metairie CDP, Louisiana.\\" U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on September 29, 2010. History Digested from a paper written by Cathy Gontar in 1998 Jefferson Parish, a long, narrow strip of land in southeastern Louisiana, stretches from the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain to Grand Isle on the Gulf of Mexico. Adjacent to Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes on the east and St. Charles and Lafourche Parishes on the west, it was named after President Thomas Jefferson, who was responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. The police jury of Jefferson Parish passed a resolution of library establishment in 1946, and the first public library was opened November 30, 1949. Branches were opened in major cities and towns. At first, none of the original library buildings were owned by the parish. The headquarters and Gretna Branch were originally at Huey P. Long and Fourth Streets on the West Bank, but later moved to Lafayette Street, and second to Second Street. The Gretna Branch in 1968 was moved out of the headquarters building on Second Street to its current location on Willow Drive. The Metairie, Jefferson, Kenner, Harahan, Marrero, Gretna, and Westwego branches were all opened in December 1949. The first Lafitte Branch opened in the town firehouse, and moved in 1982 to its present location on Highway 45. The one- room Grand Isle Branch opened in January 1950. The Harahan Branch, built in 1955, is the oldest parish library in operation. The Wagner Branch, named for former Parish Librarian Charles Wagner, opened in 1964. The headquarters building on Causeway Boulevard opened in 1967, with closed stacks. The Grand Isle Branch, destroyed by Hurricane Betsy in 1965, was rebuilt in 1970. The Terrytown Branch on the west bank opened in 1974, and was the largest library in the system until the Belle Terre Branch was built in 1981. The Live Oak Library was built on the unexcavated ruins of the Live Oak Plantation in the early 1980s. The Rosedale Library on Jefferson Highway was completed in 1987. North Kenner Branch, opened in 1985, became the largest parish library, superseded only by the Old Metairie Branch, which was completed in 1988. West Bank Regional was built and opened in 1990, upon the recommendations of HBW Associates of Dallas, a library consultant firm that did a detailed study of the library system in 1983. The new Westwego Library opened in 1995, and is the largest branch on the west bank, and fourth largest in the library system. The Lakeshore Branch, located near historical Bucktown, was opened in 1995 as well. The new flagship library of the system is the new East Bank Regional, opened in 1997 with 100,000 feet of public space and a collection of 300,000 volumes. The Marrero Branch, in a rented building on the west bank and which was recommended for closing by the 1983 library study, closed in 1997. In 1997, when library administration attempted to close the Kenner Library, housed in a small storefront on Williams Boulevard, it was opposed by members of the Jefferson Parish Council. The Kenner Library closed August 1, 1998. A bookmobile was provided by the State Library, and by 1952 there were 3 bookmobiles, one for each side of the river and one for \\"colored\\" service. This service continued until the late 60's when the library began phasing out its 5 bookmobiles. The last two bookmobiles were replaced in 1986 by vans used by current outreach services, serving nursing homes, daycare centers, and qualified homebound individuals on both banks of the river. The library's catalog and many other internet functions were automated in the late 1980s, and the branches first went on-line in 1990. Public microcomputers were also added for public use in the 90s. Over the past several years, Hurricanes Gustav, Katrina and Rita extensively damaged several of the libraries: Belle Terre Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged more than 50% of the library, requiring extensive renovations. East Bank Regional Library: Minor water damage and wind damage on roof from Hurricane Katrina. Grand Isle Library: Severe damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav, requiring it to be rebuilt. Gretna Library: Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav damaged 70% of the library, requiring it to be rebuilt. Harahan Library: Minor damage from Hurricane Katrina, requiring moderate restoration. Lafitte Library: Moderate damage from Hurricane Katrina but was badly damaged by Hurricane Rita, requiring it to be rebuilt. Lakeshore Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged 70% of the library, requiring it to be rebuilt. Live Oak Library: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged 33% of the library, requiring extensive renovations. North Kenner Library: Some damage during Hurricane Katrina and damage to 33% of the library from Hurricane Rita, requiring extensive renovations. Old Metairie Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged 15% of the library, requiring modest restoration. Rosedale Library: Virtually no damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Terrytown Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged 20% of the library, requiring moderate restoration. Wagner Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged 40% of the library, requiring extensive renovations. West Bank Regional Library: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged 35% of the library, requiring extensive renovations. Westwego Library: Hurricane Katrina damaged 33% of the library, requiring extensive renovations.

The paper publishes every Wednesday. History =Origins= The newspaper's first issue came off the press on September 24, 1869, just six months after Ulysses S. Grant had replaced Andrew Johnson as president and only eight years after Kansas had become a state.Marion County Record Founding editor and publisher A.W. Robinson called the paper The Western News, and it was initially printed 57 miles away in Detroit, in adjoining Dickinson County. The paper moved to Marion Centre in 1870 because of a community effort by J.N. Rogers, J.H. Costello, A.E. Case, Levi Billings, William H. Billings and A.A. Moore, who offered Robinson cash to relocate. Robinson's first editorial effort was to encourage better sidewalks on Main Street. He remained publisher for 19 months. John E. Murphy purchased the paper and renamed it The Western Giant. He sold it five months later to C.S. Triplett, who in 1871 changed the name to Marion County Record. After three years, Triplett sold the paper in 1874 to Edward W. Hoch, who had learned the printing trade at the short-lived Florence Pioneer, located in Florence, before moving to Marion. =Family ownership= Since 1874, two families have been involved with the Record. The Hoch family owned it for 124 years. The Meyer family has been involved for more than 60 years. E.W. Hoch ran the newspaper until his death in 1925. Son Wallis Hoch and grandson Wharton Hoch also served as editors. E.W. Hoch and another of his sons, Homer Hoch, were active in politics. E.W., a legislator from 1889 to 1891 and from 1893 to 1895, served two terms as Kansas governor from 1905 to 1909. A lawyer by training, Homer served as a member of Congress from 1919 to 1933 and as a justice of the Kansas Supreme Court from 1938 until his death in 1949. During the Hoch family's tenure, several other newspapers were folded into the Record ‚Äî or simply folded.Kansas Historical Society Eighteen separate newspapers were published in Marion, each for fewer than two years, between 1880 and 1895. The Marion Times, founded in 1890 by C.E. Foote and Henry Kuhn, became the Marion Headlight in 1899 when J.J. Buschlen purchased it. Buschlen sold the paper to the Record in 1909. The Marion Review, founded by D.O. Bell as the Lincolnville Lance in 1907, became the Marion County Lance, moved to Marion in 1908, and changed its name to the Marion Review. C.C. Jones was the Review‚Äôs first publisher. Mr. and Mrs. T.B. Matlock, Mr. and Mrs. Burton Smith, and Mr. and Mrs. John Riddle followed him as publishers until, in May 1944, the Record and the Review merged to become the Marion Record-Review. Wharton Hoch, who had taken over as editor of the Record in 1944, purchased the Riddle interest in May 1948. Three months later, Bill Meyer joined the staff as associate editor. In October 1957, the paper's name was changed back to Marion County Record. Meyer became editor after Hoch's death in 1967. He and his wife, Joan W. Meyer, and son, Eric K. Meyer, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois, purchased the newspaper from Wharton Hoch's estate in 1998. Bill Meyer died in 2006. Joan Meyer, who continues to compile the Record‚Äôs popular \\"Memories\\" column, is the newspaper's most senior staff member. She has worked at the Record for more than 50 years. Eric Meyer serves as publisher and as president of the parent corporation, Hoch Publishing Co. Inc. Donna Bernhardt, who remains a member of the board of directors along with longtime employee Melvin Honeyfield, became editor after Bill Meyer's retirement in 2003. Susan Berg succeeded her as managing editor in 2008. Adam Stewart replaced her as news editor in 2011. David Colburn succeeded him in 2014. =Present status= The Record is the oldest publication in Marion County by only a small margin. The Peabody Gazette-Bulletin (website), which the Record purchased in 2001, is 3 years younger. The Record purchased the Hillsboro Star-Journal (website), in 1999. The Record, with the largest paid circulation and largest news staff in Marion County, is a community newspaper serving as the official newspaper for the county and city of Marion. The Peabody and Hillsboro newspapers are the official newspapers for their communities. A free-distribution publication, the Hillsboro Free Press, also is distributed in the county.

Boca was one of the most successful teams before the creation of the LNB, winning many titles such as the Torneo Oficial, Torneo Apertura and Torneo Metropolitano organized by defunct leagues Federaci√≥n Argentina and Asociaci√≥n de Buenos Aires.

In 1930 the club could be registered to Federaci√≥n Argentina de B√°squet (the body that governed basketball in Argentina by then) but only junior teams took part of the competitions. The good results encouraged the club to continue participating in the league. In 1934 the team debuted at second division finishing second. In 1936 a dissident association, the \\"Asociaci√≥n de B√°squet de Buenos Aires\\" was created. This organized its own championships from 1936 to 1973 when it would later merge with the Federaci√≥n Argentina again. Boca played the tournaments held by the ABBA becoming one of the most successful teams during the decades of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.

During the decade of 1940, Boca was nicknamed \\"el equipo de las estrellas\\" (\\"the all-stars team\\" in Spanish). During those years Boca won the 1938 and 1939 Apertura championships and the Campeonato Oficial in 1940 and 1941, all of them organized by the ABBA.

Boca made an effort to play in the second division in 1986 but the association did not allow the team to participate so Boca had to play at the last division, the Regional C. The team promoted to Liga B that same year. In 1988 Boca promoted to Liga A, where the team debuted one year later. Boca Juniors did not make a good campaign so it was relegated to Liga B, where the team promoted again in 1990. At the top level again, in 1996 Boca Juniors inaugurated its first stadium built specifically for the practise of basketball, then named \\"Luis Conde\\" (mostly known as \\"La Bombonerita\\") in honour of a recently dead manager of the club.\\"Boca lo va a extra√±ar\\", La Naci√≥n, 6 March 1998] That same year Boca won its first title in the Liga Nacional (defeating Independiente (GP) at the finals. The team roster was: Byron Wilson, Jerome Mincy, Ariel Bernardini, Luis Villar, Sebasti√°n Festa, Gabriel Fern√°ndez, Claudio Farabello, Gustavo Fern√°ndez, Diego Prego, Claudio Chiappero, Sebasti√°n Acosta, Esteban Acosta, Fernando Oyarz√∫n and Ariel Eslava. Julio Lamas was the coach. That first achievement in the modern era would be succeeded by a second championship in 2003‚Äì04 (being its rival at the finals Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP)). The successful era continued, winning its third title in 2006‚Äì07 against Pe√±arol (MdP). Apart from the domestic league, Boca disputed the Copa Argentina de B√°squetbol, winning the title in 2002 (inaugural season), 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (five consecutive times). At international level, Boca won three Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (three consecutive achievements). For the 2009‚Äì10 season, Boca signed a sponsorship agreement with the Chaco based AeroChaco airlines, that contributed US$500,000 to the club's professional basketball team. As part of the agreement, Boca played in the Liga Nacional under the name \\"AeroChaco Boca Juniors\\", and also played some of its matches in the city of Resistencia.

Buhman, No. 14-4117 (10th Cir. 2016), is a legal case in the United States federal courts challenging the State of Utah's criminal polygamy law. The action was filed in 2011 by polygamous patriarch Kody Brown along with his wives Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Sullivan. The Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren faith; they are best known in connection with a reality television series featuring them, Sister Wives. The Browns prevailed in the district court in a 2013 ruling, but a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ordered the case to be dismissed on standing grounds in 2016. The Tenth Circuit concluded that because local Utah prosecutors had a policy of not pursuing most polygamy cases in the absence of additional associated crimes (e.g., welfare fraud or marriage of underage persons), the Browns had no credible fear of future prosecution and thus lacked standing. Background When the Browns first became involved in the TV series, attorneys and legal experts claimed that, because polygamy is illegal in the United States, the Browns' involvement in the series might expose them to criminal prosecution. Video footage of a marriage ceremony between Kody Brown and Robyn Sullivan was potential evidence against them. Kody Brown has claimed the family is breaking no laws because only the first marriage is a legal marriage, while the others are simply commitments. However, experts claim that the family history as a unit for 16 years, including children from all four wives could permit prosecutors to characterize the non-marriage unions as common-law marriages. Sullivan has said that the family was concerned about the legal repercussions of the series, but had discussed the matter thoroughly and decided that the positive effect their show could have on the public perception of polygamy was worth the risks. In anticipation of legal scrutiny, the producers of the show contacted the Utah Attorney General's office months before the series was broadcast. The office has not ruled out pursuing a case against the Brown family, but also stated they do not have the resources to go after polygamists unless they are suspected of serious crimes such as child abuse or child trafficking. Prior to the Sister Wives premiere, it had been nine years since anyone in Utah had been prosecuted for practicing polygamy. On September 27, 2010, the day after Sister Wives debuted, police in Lehi, Utah, announced they are investigating Kody Brown and his wives for possible charges of bigamy, a third-degree felony, which carries a possible penalty of 20 years in prison for Kody and up to five years in prison for each wife. Once the investigation concluded, the police turned their evidence over to the Utah County Attorney's office for review. Despite Brown being only legally married to one woman, Lehi police have noted that state code identifies bigamy through cohabitation, not just legal marriage contracts. In response to the investigation, the Browns released a statement: \\"We are disappointed in the announcement of an investigation, but when we decided to do this show, we knew there would be risks. But for the sake of our family, and most importantly, our kids, we felt it was a risk worth taking.\\" The Brown family hired The George Washington University constitutional law scholar Jonathan Turley, a vocal critic of anti- polygamy laws, to prepare a legal defense in the event that charges are filed. As a result of the series and legal scrutiny that came with it, Meri lost her job in the mental health industry shortly after Sister Wives debuted, even though her employer knew about the polygamist marriage before the show aired. Additionally, Kody said the show negatively affected some of his advertising sales, with some clients opting to take their business elsewhere due to publicity from the show. District court On July 13, 2011, the Browns filed a complaint in United States District Court for the District of Utah, challenging Utah's criminal polygamy law and released the following statement: > \\"There are tens of thousands of plural families in Utah and other states. We > are one of those families. We only wish to live our private lives according > to our beliefs. While we understand that this may be a long struggle in > court, it has already been a long struggle for my family and other plural > families to end the stereotypes and unfair treatment given consensual > polygamy. We are indebted to Professor Turley and his team for their work > and dedication. Together we hope to secure equal treatment with other > families in the United States.\\" On June 1, 2012, the criminal case against the Browns was dropped. However, the civil suit filed by the Browns remained active after U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups refused to dismiss it, saying \\"strategic attempt to use the mootness doctrine to evade review in this case draws into question the sincerity of [the Utah County Attorney's] contention that prosecution of plaintiffs for violating this statute is unlikely to recur.\\" The hearing on the case occurred in January 2013. On December 13, 2013, Judge Waddoups ruled that the portions of Utah's anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act. Tenth Circuit The State of Utah appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Oral argument was held on January 21, 2016. The State of Utah was represented by Parker Douglas. The plaintiffs were represented by George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, acting pro bono.Donna Bryson, 10th Circuit judges press Utah about polygamy ban in 'Sister Wives' case, Associated Press (January 21, 2016).

This is a very basic tubular blower that sits under a grate and heats the air being pumped through it from the heat of the coals. It has a high rate of airflow but a small surface area. A tubular grate heater is any grate or heat exchanger for a fireplace designed from metal tubing. Through the tubing is circulated home air that becomes heated by the fire. The air is then vented back into the room and home. It is a heat recovery device that improves the efficiency and ability of a fireplace to get the heat from the fire out and into the home. From simple to ornate, they can contribute significantly to the overall comfort of a room and potentially to a whole house. This in turn will reduce the amount of firewood needed to achieve the same comfort level, potentially reducing heating costs and expenses. Heaters increase the efficiency of a fireplace and hence the amount of heat that makes it from the fireplace out into the home. They work by having naturally convected and forced air funneled into the metal heat exchanger tubing that is then heated by the coals and/or fire. They draw in cold air from the floor and blow heated air back out into your home. This adds an element of conductive and convective heating to the radiant heat typical of a basic fireplace. Grate heaters have been called many things: heatilator, hearth heater, fireplace blower, fireplace grate heater, Fireplace Furnace, tubular grate heater, etc. The ideal tubular grate heater would be built like an ideal heat exchanger with as large a surface area as possible with material suitable to minimize the heaters thermal deterioration yet provide good thermal conductivity with a high airflow rate, similar to your home furnace. However the unique environment of a fireplace and the burning of gas, wood, coal, pellets, etc., require specific heater designs and material construction making few, if any, grate heaters compatible with all fuels. The most critical elements of any tubular grate heater are: 1) Safety - construction material and method, design and features. 2) Material - quality steel that enhances thermal conductivity, is safe (e.g. galvanized steel sweats lead), and resists thermal deterioration (e.g., tin sheet metal offers little resistance against thermal deterioration). 3) BTU rating - the combination of the unit's fire burning efficiency and the system's ability to deliver high-volume, high- temperature forced air heating into your home.This is a large and powerful grate heater system that incorporates a large, thermally-conductive heating design along with a multi-blower, high-CFM, forced-air delivery systemAnother example of a large and powerful grate heater system that incorporate a large, thermally-conductive heating design and a single-blower, high-CFM, forced-air delivery system Heat exchangers Fireplaces Residential heating appliances ","title":"Grate heater"},{"id":"28989527","text":"Valleyarm is a digital content distribution company that was founded in 2009.

It was announced for the Nintendo 3DS on September 29, 2010, during a Nintendo press conference for the 3DS. The game was to be directed by Masakuza Eguchi, with Tatsuya Kitabayashi acting as producer. Reo Uratani composed the game's music. Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled on July 18, 2011. Plot The game's story would have continued right after the events of Mega Man Legends 2. Two new characters, Aero and Barrett, would join returning ones to help rescue the protagonist, Mega Man Volnutt, from Elysium. Chris Hoffman of Nintendo Power implied the finished game may have focused on a mysterious item known as the Klicke Lafonica and the aftermath of the Elder System reactivating at the end of Legends 2. Development In a May 2007 interview with 1UP.com, Keiji Inafune expressed that the original team members who worked on the previous Mega Man Legends games were interested in developing Mega Man Legends 3 and had considered using the MT Framework engine. A few months later, Inafune commented that he was asked by several fans if Mega Man Legends 3 would be made; although he expressed a desire to make such a game, he stated that he could not do it at that time. Detailed information about the game was announced at the New York Comic Con in October 2010. While Capcom was developing the game, several aspects from the game such as the new heroine Aero, a mech and Mega Man's design were chosen by fans as Capcom invited fans to send their designs in their official Mega Man Legends 3 website. Although Inafune left Capcom in November 2010, the team working for Mega Man Legends 3 stated that the game would continue development. Capcom intended to release Mega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version in 2011 for the 3DS eShop, featuring 10 missions, and Barrett as a playable character. The Prototype Version was going to act as a prologue to the forthcoming main game. According to GamesRadar, Nintendo Powers Chris Hoffman was the only journalist to play the Prototype Version before the game was cancelled. Three years after the game's cancellation, employees from Cup of Tea Productions‚Äîthe studio responsible for Mega Man Legends 3 voice recording‚Äîconfirmed that the Prototype Version was very close to completion. Cancellation On July 18, 2011, Capcom officially announced that production on Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled. Capcom also announced that neither a full game nor Mega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version would be released. In replies to fans two days later, Capcom's UK Twitter account appeared to blame lack of fan involvement for the game's cancellation. Capcom UK later apologized for the original wording and clarified that the tweets referred to the lack of interaction in the Development Rooms that Capcom created to help the game's development, not to the fans \\"who have been nothing but supportive\\". The game's programming director, Yoshiyuki Fujikawa, encouraged fans to continue showing their interest in Mega Man Legends 3. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama‚Äîwho was working with Capcom on Asura's Wrath at the time‚Äîstated he would like to develop Mega Man Legends 3 as he was disappointed in the game's cancellation. Inafune also expressed disappointment with this decision and offered Capcom to complete it with his own team, despite having left the company. Capcom refused Inafune's offer. In 2014, Inafune again stated he would like to finish Mega Man Legends 3 if given the chance. Following the cancellation, fans created a Facebook group titled \\"100,000 Strong for Bringing Back Mega Man Legends 3\\", aiming to get Capcom to resume development of the game. The group was covered considerably on popular gaming sites, including Destructoid, Joystiq, and GoNintendo. The group reached its goal of 100,000 members on April 25, 2012. In August 2016, over five years after the game's cancellation, the group released a documentary about the history of the game's development. In a 2018 interview with Game Informer, Mega Man 11 director Koji Oda said that he's \\"well aware that there is a voice out there that wants something new for games like Mega Man Legends and Battle Network.\\" On June 9, 2020, composer Makoto Tomozawa made a tweet asking if fans would crowdfund the game.

He helped develop an electronic system of storing and retrieving information called Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS) which replaced the old index cataloging system. American Libraries included Rogers on the list of \\"100 of the most important people in 20th-century librarianship.\\"Kniffel, Leonard, Sullivan, Peggy & McCormick, Edith (Dec 1999). ‚Äú100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century‚Äù, American Libraries, 30(11), 38. Early life and education Rogers was born in Norwood, Ohio to Frank Shane and Nettie Bradway Rogers, a postal worker and a homemaker. He grew up in the Cincinnati area with siblings Ralph, Wayne and Eleanor, and attended the schools there. Upon graduation from the Walnut Hills High School in 1932,Moritz, Charles (Ed.) (1962). Current Biography (23rd ed.). The H. W. Wilson Company. pp. 359‚Äì361. he was fortunate to acquire a scholarship to attend Yale University as a premed student. He spent four years at Yale, during which time he occupied himself with writing for the newspaper on campus, participating in amateur drama performances and working with the student government. He also worked as a waiter to help sustain him financially. Work Newsweek magazine hired him to work as an ‚Äúoffice boy‚Äù after he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1936. After job hopping in several states for about two years, he enrolled at the Ohio State University College of Medicine United States National Library of Medicine Database. ‚ÄúModernizing the Library.‚Äù. September 15, 2010. pp. 311‚Äì341. and obtained a Medical Doctor degree in 1942. During his time at Ohio State, he joined the ‚ÄúReserved Officer Training Corps.‚Äù This was a prelude to joining the Army. He enlisted in the Army with the rank of First Lieutenant, after he finished his medical training. He interned at the Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco and later trained and taught at the Medical Field Service School in Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. On June 5, 1942, Rogers married his wife, Barbara Pitt, who was a school teacher. Their union produced three children, Ellen, Peter, and Shane. From 1945 until 1947, Rogers served as a surgeon in the Philippines and Japan. He returned to the United States in 1947 to an appointed position of ‚Äúresident in surgery at the Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C.‚Äù. While working at the Walter Reed Hospital, he stumbled across information about a job opening of Director at the Army Medical Library (AML). This job posting awakened his passion for working with books. Along with several other candidates, Rogers applied for and got the job. He started his new career at the Library on March 1, 1948. At the time Rogers joined the library, it was facing organizational problems that his predecessor Colonel Joseph H. McNinch McClure, Lucretia W. (Jan 2002). ‚ÄúSeparate paths to greatness‚Äù, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 90(1), 104-107. was trying to solve. He made several recommendations to the Surgeon General including hiring a ‚Äúqualified professional librarian‚Äù and sending the person to medical school or sending a qualified physician to library school with the person being ‚Äúexempt from automatic rotation‚Äù.Blake, John B. (January 1988). ‚ÄúFrank Bradway Rogers 1914-1987- Obituaries‚Äù, Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 76(1), 95-97. Automatic rotation involved an old law that ‚Äúprohibited regular military officers from staying in Washington for more than four years.‚Äù Achievements/Affiliations In fulfillment of McNinch's recommendation, Rogers attended Columbia University School of Library Service where he attained a master's degree in Library Science in September 1949. On October 21, 1949, he became the Director of AML. He was dedicated to the library. He studied the system and consistently strove to enhance it, as seen in this sentence from his obituary by John Blake. ‚ÄúRogers went to fundamentals and carried forward the basic reforms in acquisitions and cataloging necessary to undergird more visible advances in bibliographical and other services.‚Äù He made many notable contributions, among them was converting the archaic index-cataloging to a ‚Äúrevised Current List of Medical Literature and a new Army Medical Library Catalog‚Äù. He assisted in the development of the Current List into a mechanized form, laying the foundation for the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS) that electronically stored and retrieved information. MEDLARS ‚Äúprovided the medical profession [...] with the most powerful bibliographic tool in the world [....] Its success marked a milestone in the evolution of modern libraries.‚Äù One of Rogers‚Äô greatest achievements, according to Charles Moritz (from the Current Biography Yearbook) was the establishment of a legal basis for the Library. A bill to create a national medical library submitted by Senators Lister Hill and John F. Kennedy on March 13, 1956 was passed by Congress. President Eisenhower signed the legislation on August 3, 1956.Miles, Wyndham D., ‚ÄúA History of the National Library of Medicine‚Äù. 1982. September 14, 2010. The goal of the bill was ‚Äúto promote the progress of medicine and to advance the national health and welfare.‚Äù It also included combining the AML, Navy medical libraries Air Force, and the Public Health Service into one system. This new system was named the ‚ÄúNational Medical Library‚Äù . (NLM). The bill passed and the legislation was signed by President Eisenhower on August 3, 1956. Rogers served as the Director beginning October 1, 1956. He was actively involved in the erection of a new building in Bethesda, Maryland to house the Library. Rogers was intrigued with computers and technology and was always researching ways to upgrade the institution. He made numerous positive changes that updated the Library. His achievements and innovations did not go unnoticed. He was offered several jobs from organizations like World Health Organization (1958), the United Nations (1959‚Äì61), and a number of universities. He received the Marcia C. Noyes Award for outstanding achievement in medical librarianship in 1961, from the Medical Library Association (MLA). He was also awarded the Melvil Dewey Award from the American Library Association (ALA) in 1963. He was president of MLA from 1962 to 1963. He retired from NLM in 1963 and went to work for the University of Colorado Medical Center. Rogers wrote many articles, reviews, reports, books and among them the book ‚ÄúSelected Papers.‚Äù This book was about the life of John Shaw Billings, in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the AML (1965). Rogers wrote that, ‚ÄúBillings was born on April 12, 1838, son of James and Abby Shaw Billings, in Cotton Township, Switzerland County, Indiana.

Types of lift tickets Types of lift tickets may vary by time period, or type of lift. ;Direct application to clothing Before ticket wickets, zip-ties, and RFID cards, lift tickets were stapled or glued directly to clothing, to prevent ticket holders from transferring lift tickets from one skier to another, thereby depriving ski resorts of revenue. This approach, however, damaged skiers' clothing. ;Ticket wicket Ski resorts (and other venues that issue tickets) commonly use a wicket to secure the ticket (called a \\"ticket wicket\\"), a short piece of light wire which loops through the ticket holder's clothing or backpack. The ticket wicket was invented by Killington Ski Resort employee Martin S. \\"Charlie\\" Hanley, in 1963, and given its name by his wife Jane. Hanley patented the ticket wicket the Canada and the United States in 1966,Hanley, Martin S. (September 20, 1966). \\"Ski ticket wicket\\". Canada Patent 742,863. and assigned the rights to Killington's parent company, The Sherburne Corporation, for whom he had developed the wicket while on their payroll. The Sherbourne Corporation licensed the ticket wicket to ski areas across the U.S. following a ski operators road show, at which the Hanleys promoted it. Despite quick and widespread adoption of the wicket both domestically and abroad, however, Hanley never made any money off the soon- ubiquitous ticket wicket; an avid skier, he was content to invent something that further developed the then-nascent sport of downhill skiing. In 1995, John C. Myles, Melisa Syracusa, and Edward M. Friedlander, Jr. patented another version of the ticket wicket. The wicket inspired several innovations to make its use more convenient, such as ski ticket holder \\"pigtail\\". In addition, many ski jackets are designed with wickets in mind, providing plastic or cloth loops that allow the attachment of a wicket without interfering with zipper operation. ;Zip-tie Today, although ticket wickets are still widely used, some resorts now use plastic zip-ties rather than metal wires to secure tickets. As Greg Morrill notes, \\"The zip-ties made it easier to remove the ticket, but the zip-tie remained. I still see quite a few skiers with a collection of ticket-less zip-ties hooked to their parka.\\" The difficulty removing zip ties from clothing is but one issue those plastic fasteners fail to resolve; another is: \\"For ski areas there was the problem of checking tickets. Historically this was a manual process performed by lift personnel. But as the number of skiers increased, staff had to be added expressly to check tickets. Part of this need was also driven by the fact that as ticket prices went up there was more incentive for customers to rip-off the system.\\" Manually checking tickets is complicated by the popular practice of skiers Morrill refers to as \\"Ticket Turkeys\\", \\"I believe ‚Äúturkey‚Äù is the appropriate term since the male turkey (the bird) fans out his tail feathers to impress the female. The Ticket Turkey fans out his tickets to also impress, but I‚Äôm not sure who he is trying to impress.\\" who retain a collection of used ski tickets on their clothing, thereby forcing human ticket checkers \\"to parse through a collection of tickets to find the current one.\\" ;RFID card Some ski resorts have overcome the above-mentioned problems by issuing, instead of lift tickets, digital cards embedded with RFID chips. These cards are kept in a pocket during the skier's visit to the resort, as they do not need to be removed for the access gate to detect them.

His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the \\"second great unification in physics\\" where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton. With the publication of \\"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\" in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light. He proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. (This article accompanied an 8 December 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society. His statement that \\"light and magnetism are affections of the same substance\\" is at page 499.) The unification of light and electrical phenomena led his prediction of the existence of radio waves. Maxwell is also regarded as a founder of the modern field of electrical engineering.Tapan K. Sakar, Magdalena Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta; James Clerk Maxwell: The Founder of Electrical Engineering; 2010 Second Region 8 IEEE Conference on the History of Communications;IEEE He helped develop the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, a statistical means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases. He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) like those in many bridges. His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics. Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th- century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. In the millennium poll‚Äîa survey of the 100 most prominent physicists‚ÄîMaxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein. On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, Einstein described Maxwell's work as the \\"most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton\\". Einstein, when he visited the University of Cambridge in 1922, was told by his host that he had done great things because he stood on Newton's shoulders; Einstein replied: \\"No I don't. I stand on the shoulders of Maxwell\\".Mary Shine Thompson,2009, The Fire l' the Flint,p.103; Four Courts Life =Early life, 1831‚Äì1839= James Clerk Maxwell's birthplace at 14 India Street, Edinburgh. It is now the home of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation. James Clerk Maxwell was born on 13 June 1831 at 14 India Street, Edinburgh, to John Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie, an advocate, and Frances Cay daughter of Robert Hodshon Cay and sister of John Cay. (His birthplace now houses a museum operated by the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation.) His father was a man of comfortable means of the Clerk family of Penicuik, holders of the baronetcy of Clerk of Penicuik. His father's brother was the 6th Baronet. He had been born \\"John Clerk\\", adding Maxwell to his own after he inherited (as an infant in 1793) the Middlebie estate, a Maxwell property in Dumfriesshire. James was a first cousin of both the artist Jemima Blackburn (the daughter of his father's sister) and the civil engineer William Dyce Cay (the son of his mother's brother). Cay and Maxwell were close friends and Cay acted as his best man when Maxwell married. Maxwell's parents met and married when they were well into their thirties; his mother was nearly 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who died in infancy. When Maxwell was young his family moved to Glenlair, in Kirkcudbrightshire which his parents had built on the estate which comprised . All indications suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age. By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or made a noise drew the question: \\"what's the go o' that?\\" In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness: =Education, 1839‚Äì1847= Recognising the boy's potential, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for his early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. His education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a 16 year old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man hired to instruct Maxwell, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. The tutor was dismissed in November 1841. James' father took him to Robert Davidson's demonstration of electric propulsion and magnetic force on February 12, 1842, an experience with profound implications for the boy.Anthony F. Anderson (11 June 1981) Forces of Inspiration, The New Scientist, pages 712,3 via Google Books Edinburgh Academy, where Maxwell was educated Maxwell was sent to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima. The 10-year-old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school. The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior. His mannerisms and Galloway accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of \\"Daftie\\". He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years. Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met Lewis Campbell and Peter Guthrie Tait, two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends. Maxwell was fascinated by geometry at an early age, rediscovering the regular polyhedra before he received any formal instruction. Despite his winning the school's scripture biography prize in his second year, his academic work remained unnoticed until, at the age of 13, he won the school's mathematical medal and first prize for both English and poetry. Maxwell's interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance. He wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of twine, and the properties of ellipses, Cartesian ovals, and related curves with more than two foci. The work, of 1846, \\"On the description of oval curves and those having a plurality of foci\\" \\\\- accessed 2020-03-12 was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by James Forbes, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, because Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself. The work was not entirely original, since Ren√© Descartes had also examined the properties of such multifocal ellipses in the 17th century, but he had simplified their construction. =University of Edinburgh, 1847‚Äì1850= Old College, University of Edinburgh Maxwell left the Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at the University of Edinburgh. He had the opportunity to attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of the University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at the University demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the University and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, however his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures. At age 18, Maxwell contributed two papers for the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. One of these, \\"On the Equilibrium of Elastic Solids\\", laid the foundation for an important discovery later in his life, which was the temporary double refraction produced in viscous liquids by shear stress. His other paper was \\"Rolling Curves\\" and, just as with the paper \\"Oval Curves\\" that he had written at the Edinburgh Academy, he was again considered too young to stand at the rostrum to present it himself. The paper was delivered to the Royal Society by his tutor Kelland instead. =University of Cambridge, 1850‚Äì1856= A young Maxwell at Trinity College, Cambridge. He is holding one of his colour wheels. In October 1850, already an accomplished mathematician, Maxwell left Scotland for the University of Cambridge. He initially attended Peterhouse, however before the end of his first term transferred to Trinity, where he believed it would be easier to obtain a fellowship. At Trinity he was elected to the elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Maxwell's intellectual understanding of his Christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his Cambridge years. He joined the \\"Apostles\\", an exclusive debating society of the intellectual elite, where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding. The extent to which Maxwell \\"ploughed up\\" his Christian beliefs and put them to the intellectual test, can be judged only incompletely from his writings. But there is plenty of evidence, especially from his undergraduate days, that he did deeply examine his faith. Certainly, his knowledge of the Bible was remarkable, so his confidence in the Scriptures was not based on ignorance. In the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the Suffolk home of the Rev C.B. Tayler, the uncle of a classmate, G.W.H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife. On his return to Cambridge, Maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including the following testimony, In November 1851, Maxwell studied under William Hopkins, whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him the nickname of \\"senior wrangler-maker\\". In 1854, Maxwell graduated from Trinity with a degree in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind Edward Routh and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the Smith's Prize examination. Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper \\"On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending\\" to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. This is one of the few purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating his growing stature as a mathematician. Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years. Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure. The nature and perception of colour was one such interest which he had begun at the University of Edinburgh while he was a student of Forbes. With the coloured spinning tops invented by Forbes, Maxwell was able to demonstrate that white light would result from a mixture of red, green, and blue light. His paper \\"Experiments on Colour\\" laid out the principles of colour combination and was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 1855. Maxwell was this time able to deliver it himself. Maxwell was made a fellow of Trinity on 10 October 1855, sooner than was the norm, and was asked to prepare lectures on hydrostatics and optics and to set examination papers. The following February he was urged by Forbes to apply for the newly vacant Chair of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen. His father assisted him in the task of preparing the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy. He accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856. =Marischal College, Aberdeen, 1856‚Äì1860= Maxwell proved that the Rings of Saturn were made of numerous small particles. The 25-year-old Maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at Marischal. He engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department, devising the syllabus and preparing lectures. He committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week, including a weekly pro bono lecture to the local working men's college. He lived in Aberdeen with his cousin William Dyce Cay, a Scottish civil engineer, during the six months of the academic year and spent the summers at Glenlair, which he had inherited from his father. James and Katherine Maxwell, 1869 He focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years: the nature of Saturn's rings. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn. The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John's College, Cambridge had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize. Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, he concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called \\"brick- bats\\", each independently orbiting Saturn. Maxwell was awarded the ¬£130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay \\"On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings\\"; he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry. His work was so detailed and convincing that when George Biddell Airy read it he commented \\"It is one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen.\\" It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the Voyager flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction that the rings were composed of particles. It is now understood, however, that the rings' particles are not stable at all, being pulled by gravity onto Saturn. The rings are expected to vanish entirely over the next 300 million years. In 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who was then the Principal of Marischal. Through him Maxwell met Dewar's daughter, Katherine Mary Dewar. They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the marriage record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen.James Clerk Maxwell and Katherine Mary Dewar marriage certificate, Family History Library film #280176, district 168/2 (Old Machar, Aberdeen), page 83, certificate No. 65. Katherine was seven years Maxwell's senior. Comparatively little is known of her, although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in viscosity. Maxwell's biographer and friend, Lewis Campbell, adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of Katherine, though describing their married life as \\"one of unexampled devotion\\". In 1860 Marischal College merged with the neighbouring King's College to form the University of Aberdeen. There was no room for two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to Tait. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at King's College, London, instead. After recovering from a near-fatal bout of smallpox in 1860, he moved to London with his wife. =King's College, London, 1860‚Äì1865= IEEE Milestone Plaques, the others being at Maxwell's birthplace in Edinburgh and the family home at Glenlair. Maxwell's time at King's was probably the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities‚Äînow known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40 years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents. Blue plaque, 16 Palace Gardens Terrace, Kensington, Maxwell's home, 1860‚Äì1865 This time is especially noteworthy for the advances Maxwell made in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper \\"On physical lines of force\\", which was published in 1861. In it he provided a conceptual model for electromagnetic induction, consisting of tiny spinning cells of magnetic flux. Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part he discussed the nature of electrostatics and displacement current. In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the polarisation of light in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the Faraday effect. =Later years, 1865‚Äì1879= The gravestone at Parton Kirk (Galloway) of James Clerk Maxwell, his parents and his wife This memorial stone to James Clerk Maxwell stands on a green in front of the church, beside the war memorial at Parton (Galloway). In 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine. In his paper 'On governors' (1868) he mathematically described the behaviour of governors, devices that control the speed of steam engines, thereby establishing the theoretical basis of control engineering.Maxwell, J.C. (1868),'On governors', from the proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 100 In his paper \\"On reciprocal figures, frames and diagrams of forces\\" (1870) he discussed the rigidity of various designs of lattice. He wrote the textbook Theory of Heat (1871) and the treatise Matter and Motion (1876). Maxwell was also the first to make explicit use of dimensional analysis, in 1871. In 1871 he returned to Cambridge to become the first Cavendish Professor of Physics. Maxwell was put in charge of the development of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water. In March 1879 Maxwell sent an important letter to the astronomer David Todd. In April 1879 Maxwell began to have difficulty in swallowing, the first symptom of his fatal illness. Maxwell died in Cambridge of abdominal cancer on 5 November 1879 at the age of 48. His mother had died at the same age of the same type of cancer. The minister who regularly visited him in his last weeks was astonished at his lucidity and the immense power and scope of his memory, but comments more particularly, As death approached Maxwell told a Cambridge colleague, Maxwell is buried at Parton Kirk, near Castle Douglas in Galloway close to where he grew up. The extended biography The Life of James Clerk Maxwell, by his former schoolfellow and lifelong friend Professor Lewis Campbell, was published in 1882. His collected works were issued in two volumes by the Cambridge University Press in 1890. The executors of Maxwell's estate were his physician George Edward Paget, G. G. Stokes, and Colin Mackenzie, who was Maxwell's cousin. Overburdened with work, Stokes passed Maxwell's papers to William Garnett, who had effective custody of the papers until about 1884. There is a memorial inscription to him near the choir screen at Westminster Abbey.'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p58: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 =Personal life= As a great lover of Scottish poetry, Maxwell memorised poems and wrote his own. The best known is Rigid Body Sings, closely based on \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" by Robert Burns, which he apparently used to sing while accompanying himself on a guitar. It has the opening lines A collection of his poems was published by his friend Lewis Campbell in 1882. Descriptions of Maxwell remark upon his remarkable intellectual qualities being matched by social awkwardness. Maxwell was an evangelical Presbyterian and in his later years became an Elder of the Church of Scotland. Maxwell's religious beliefs and related activities have been the focus of a number of papers. Attending both Church of Scotland (his father's denomination) and Episcopalian (his mother's denomination) services as a child, Maxwell later underwent an evangelical conversion in April 1853. One facet of this conversion may have aligned him with an antipositivist position. Scientific legacy =Electromagnetism= Peter Tait Maxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper \\"On Faraday's lines of force\\" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work and how electricity and magnetism are related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as \\"On Physical Lines of Force\\" in March 1861. Around 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the speed of light (see speed of light#electromagnetic constants). He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, \\"We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.\\" Working on the problem further, Maxwell showed that the equations predict the existence of waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of . In his 1864 paper \\"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\", Maxwell wrote, \\"The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws\\". His famous twenty equations, in their modern form of four partial differential equations, first appeared in fully developed form in his textbook A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism in 1873. Most of this work was done by Maxwell at Glenlair during the period between holding his London post and his taking up the Cavendish chair. Oliver Heaviside reduced the complexity of Maxwell's theory down to four differential equations, known now collectively as Maxwell's Laws or Maxwell's equations. Although potentials became much less popular in the nineteenth century,B.J. Hunt (1991) The Maxwellians, pages 165,6, Cornell University Press the use of scalar and vector potentials is now standard in the solution of Maxwell's equations. As Barrett and Grimes (1995) describe: > Maxwell expressed electromagnetism in the algebra of quaternions and made > the electromagnetic potential the centerpiece of his theory. In 1881 > Heaviside replaced the electromagnetic potential field by force fields as > the centerpiece of electromagnetic theory. According to Heaviside, the > electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be > \\"assassinated\\". (sic) A few years later there was a debate between Heaviside > and [Peter Guthrie] Tate (sic) about the relative merits of vector analysis > and quaternions. The result was the realization that there was no need for > the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was > purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proved correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics. Maxwell also introduced the concept of the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether. =Colour vision= First durable colour photographic image, demonstrated by James Clerk Maxwell in an 1861 lecture Along with most physicists of the time, Maxwell had a strong interest in psychology. Following in the steps of Isaac Newton and Thomas Young, he was particularly interested in the study of colour vision. From 1855 to 1872, Maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning the perception of colour, colour-blindness, and colour theory, and was awarded the Rumford Medal for \\"On the Theory of Colour Vision\\". Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, that white light, such as sunlight, is composed of a number of monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry. Maxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene. (This thought-experiment is described on pages 283‚Äì284. The short-wavelength filter is specified as \\"violet\\", but during the 19th century \\"violet\\" could be used to describe a deep violet-blue such as the colour of cobalt glass.) During an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, inventor of the single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that \\"if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue,\\" it \\"would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved.\\" Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed. =Kinetic theory and thermodynamics= Maxwell's demon, a thought experiment where entropy decreases thermodynamic surface later named after him (letter to Thomson, 8 July 1875) Maxwell also investigated the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician. Between 1859 and 1866, he developed the theory of the distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. His work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that came to be known as Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy. In 1871 he established Maxwell's thermodynamic relations, which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials with respect to different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a plaster thermodynamic visualisation as a way of exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs's graphical thermodynamics papers. =Control theory= Maxwell published the paper \\"On governors\\" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. 16 (1867‚Äì1868). This paper is considered a central paper of the early days of control theory. Here \\"governors\\" refers to the governor or the centrifugal governor used to regulate steam engines.

Rates of infestations in developed countries while decreasing from the 1930s to the 1980s have increased dramatically since the 1980s. Previous to this they were common in the developing world but rare in the developed world. The increase in the developed world may have been caused by increased international travel, resistance to insecticides, and the use of new pest-control methods that do not affect bed bugs.Archive The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of DDT to kill cockroaches, which are a natural predator of the bed bug. The invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role. Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism. Developed world Bed bugs are increasing in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. The infestations have been occurring in a wide range of facilities in the developed world in recent years including: hotels (from backpacker to five star), overnight trains, private homes, cruise ships, schools, hospitals and homeless shelters. These infestations are occasionally of both types of bed bugs (common and tropical). The increased rates of infestations have been matched by increased media coverage. Pest management companies have also seen a many fold increase in calls regarding bed bugs during the 2000s. =United Kingdom= Figures from one London borough show reported bed bug infestations doubling each year from 1995 to 2001. There is also evidence of a previous cycle of bed bug infestations in the U.K. in the mid-1980s. In 2010 the increase of infestation in UK was estimated to be around 24%.http://www.bedbugsremovalguide.com/bed- bug-bites.html In the hot summer of 2018 it was reported that bedbug infestations had been increasing year-on-year in UK cities since 2006, with no sign of levelling off. This was considered likely to be due to increased temperatures. Bedbugs were commonly found in seats on London buses and Tube trains. =United States= Bed bugs have been reported in all 50 states. The U.S. National Pest Management Association reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005. The Steritech Group, a pest-management company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, claimed that 25% of the 700 hotels they surveyed between 2002 and 2006 needed bed bug treatment. The resurgence led the United States Environmental Protection Agency to hold a National Bed Bug Summit in 2009. Numbers of reported incidents in New York City rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009 mostly in Brooklyn area.Brooklyn bed bug exterminator website In August 2010, bed bugs were found in the Elle Fashion Hachette building in New York City. After suspected infestation, a beagle trained in sniffing bed bugs was used to confirm their presence. Office workers were told to work from home while the building was being treated. Although largely thought to only cause problems in less maintained and dirty environments, there is an increasing incidence of bed bugs for infesting indoor environments of high maintenance standards.New York Fashion. Elle has bedbugs! 20 Aug 2010. http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/08/elle_has_bedbugs_1.html#commentsO‚ÄôReilly, Kelly. New York NBC. Elle Offices Closed for Bedbugs. 20 Aug 2012. http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-Confirmed-Elle-Offices-Closed- for-Bed-Bugs-101153694.html One recent theory about bed bug reappearance is that they never truly disappeared from the United States, but may have been forced to alternative hosts. Consistent with this is the finding the bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in Arkansas. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work. In November 2016 a media report noted that tropical bed bugs, Cimex hemipterus, which had been extirpated from the state during World War II, were discovered in Brevard County, Florida and were expected to spread in distribution within the United States.Weather.com: Spotted in Florida For First Time Since WWII, Posted: 14 November 2016 04:45 PM EST, Updated: 14 November 2016 04:45 PM EST -- \\"Tropical bedbugs invade Florida for the first time in 60 years. There are now fears of a widespread infestation.\\" =Canada= Bed bug infestations have been becoming an increasing issue in urban environments. In a Toronto, Canada study, the mean number of treatments required per affected location was highest at dormitories, hotels, homeless shelters, and rooming houses. Suspected reasons for this increase include increasing world travel, high exchange rates of residents, reluctance to use insecticides because of concerns regarding toxicity, and insecticide resistance. 65 Toronto homeless shelters were surveyed and 31% reported past or present bed bug infestations. Developing world Bed bugs have historically been only a particular problem in developed countries in which they occur both in rural settings and urban setting associated with overcrowding.

Life He was the eldest son of Owen Owens (died 1593) or John Owen, a Welsh-born Archdeacon of Anglesey, and Jane, his second wife. The son John was baptised at Burton- Latimer on 8 November 1580, and graduated B.A. from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1597. He subsequently became Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and proceeded M.A. in 1600 and D.D. in 1618. He was incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 16 July 1600.1500-1714, Oade-Oxwick He remained at Cambridge for some years, and appears as taxor there in 1608. In 1608 he succeeded to the rectory of Burton-Latimer and was appointed chaplain to Prince Charles. In 1625 he received the rectories of Carlton, Northamptonshire, and of Cottingham in the same county. Owen was in favour with William Laud, and was liked by Charles I; on 18 August 1629, he was elected bishop of St Asaph. He was consecrated at Croydon on 20 September, instituted on 23 September, and had his temporalities restored on 26 September 1629. In the same month, on 15 September, he received a grant to hold in commendam the archdeaconry of St Asaph and other benefices within his diocese, and the archdeaconry of Bangor to a value not exceeding ¬£150 per annum. In his diocese, he boasted, he was connected by descent with every family of quality. He was active in the pastoral work of his bishopric and was the first to institute a series of Welsh sermons to be preached in the parish church the first Sunday of each month by members of the parish who derived a portion of their income from its tithes. He superintended improvements in the structure of the cathedral, including the building of a new organ in 1635. Owen held six rectories with his bishopric, mostly in commendam. In the First English Civil War he suffered for his loyalty to the king. Having joined in the petition of the eleven bishops on 30 December 1641, he was impeached of high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London. On 6 April following, when his bishopric was sequestrated, he was allowed by parliament ¬£500 per annum. The sequestration of his rectories, the sale of his episcopal property and desecration of his palace followed. Owen died on 15 October 1651, at Perth Kinsey, and was buried in the cathedral church of St. Asaph, under the bishops' throne (21 October). Family Owen married, first: Sarah Hodelow of Cambridgeshire, by whom he had a son, Robert Owen, fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, B.C.L. on 3 Dec. 1660, and shortly after chancellor of the diocese of St. Asaph; and a daughter, married to Dr. William Griffith, chancellor of Bangor and St. Asaph. The first wife was buried at Burton-Latimer in February 1621. Owen's second wife was Elizabeth Gray; and his third wife, Elin, daughter of Robert Wyn of Conway.

The Whitehope Burn is probably the branch of the system furthest from Berwick. The hill is Chalk Rig and it carries the Dumfriesshire/Peeblesshire march and the East-West watershed of Scotland. The Scottish watershed is the drainage divide in Scotland that separates river systems that flow to the east into the North Sea from those that flow to the west and north into the Atlantic Ocean. At a point on the summit of Ben Lomond for example, looking west all water flows to the Firth of Clyde, and looking east all water flows into the Firth of Forth. Similarly Cumbernauld is a point on this line and arguably its Gaelic name has, for hundreds of years, reflected this fact. There is some dispute however about interpretation of the Gaelic phrase. The line joining all such points in Scotland is the Scottish watershed. Dave Hewitt en route back to the watershed route after a rest day in Shiel Bridge in 1987. Although the concept of geographical watersheds is common, the first unequivocal reference to the Scottish watershed is to be found in Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer of 1884, in which the entry defines the northern terminus as being at Duncansby Head. This was followed in 1912 with the Bartholomew Atlas Survey (NLS) which shows the entire geographic feature, from the border with England to Duncansby Head. The first popular delineation of the Scottish watershed took place as recently as 1986. It was mapped out in that year by Dave Hewitt, who in 1987 then walked the line of the watershed from south to north.Hewitt, Dave (1988) Walking the Watershed' 'Glasgow: TACit Press.

The series was released on CD and through the iTunes Store with bonus tracks. This album won the 2010 ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release.  Episodes  = Progressive Rock (1979) = The band was Lake Deuteronomy which was a 6 piece progressive rock band. Originally a 43 piece band but there were disagreements over which direction to take the band in. 8 wanted to become an experimental rock band, 14 wanted to go in a reggae direction, 12 wanted to be in an umpapa band, 6 enjoyed Gilbert & Sullivan light operata and 2 who wanted to do impressions of bird calls. They tried to keep everyone happy with their Egypt record but this led to poor sales and 6 members relaunched Lake Deuteronomy as a progressive band. They created the record Newspaper which was an experimental album to record an entire issue of The Daily Mail including the articles, the classifieds, births and deaths and the movie listings. They then went on to create The Flood which inspired a stadium show that involved pouring in galleons of water to fill the stadium to simulate a flood. This caused multiple drownings and was very controversial because of this. They then signed with Otto Ganon's label, Parasite Records and created Spool in the Pits of Prometheus. This album inspired further musical experimentation such as recording the guitar sounds in a deep sea dive tank next to the Titanic and attaching the drum kit to the roof and playing it upside down. = Folk (1984)= The singer was Egg Zagar who was a folk musician from the US. He was born Kenneth Silverman in 1958. His family were poor musicians so Zagar had to complete basic everyday activities such as brushing his teeth, mowing the lawn and buttering his bread with a guitar. Zagar was angry about the growing divide between toothbrush owners and non-toothbrush owners so he wrote folk protest songs such as We Shall All Prevail. His debut album released under Leech Records was Songs from a Death Bed and promptly became a cult figure from its rising popularity. In 1965 Zagar went through a series of marriages with Liesel, Frumpina and his Korean meditation teacher as Otto did not agree with his choice of names as Zagar wrote love songs about them and had trouble rhyming words with their names. Zagar and his Korean wife retired from the music industry and moved to Berlin for 8 years. When Zagar returned to the US he went to record his new album in a studio in California near the beach. Unfortunately he got trapped under a beached whale on the first day while sun baking. He died on 24 August 1984. Otto was determined to get a record so Pitch had to use the only piece of recorded audio which was \\"Don't use artificial sweetener, I'm a phenylketonuric\\" to make an album. With a combination of guest singers and the recorded audio Zagar's final record Whale Song was released and became a top selling album. = Punk Rock (1975) = The band was The Fat Cocks were a British Punk Group. The group, composed of brothers Archie Cock, Filthy Cock and Cecil Cock were from Sheffield. The group attended Brinsworth Comprehensive School and formed a band once they had graduated. Originally the band could only play one note which is shown on their first record. The band wanted to have a \\"garage band\\" sound, unfortunately they did not have a garage so they used to play on the busy street. However Otto Ganon passed by one day and offered them ¬£10,000 to make a record on the condition they did not write or sing and of the songs, they did not approach the studio, they all changed their surnames to \\"Cock\\" and they all had to get a safety pin through their scrotums. Their first album \\"Bastard, Bastard, Bastard, Bastard, Bastard, Bastard, Balls\\" received limited airplay however they received publicity for their large scale antics. These antics included releasing four hippopotamuses in Westminster Abbey and holding the weatherman at gun point whilst on tour in Australia. Their second album \\"Pardon my Phlegm\\" was influenced by Archie Cock's interest in systems of government and Consociationalism. It was written during the rise of Margaret Thatcher. The Fat Cocks blamed Margaret Thatcher for nearly everything including the death of Anne Frank. The record also contained the hit political anthem \\"Hey Ho Hey Ho He Hoo He Hoo\\". Their third album \\"Corgi Scum\\" was an attack on the British Monarchy. However most of the songs were attacking very minor members of the aristocracy and the corgi dogs. Otto flew the band to New York City to play a rooftop gig but it was on the Chrysler Building which was quite challenging for the band to play on due to its angle. Filthy Cock was into fridging at the time and it was becoming a problem for the band. Filthy died during a fridging incident on 27 November 1975. He was replaced by the bass player from the Children's band \\"The Pedals\\". In 1995 they received a lifetime achievement award at The Grammys and later a Knighthood.

Ka≈æotiƒá was a humanist and orator who had served first as the Bishop of Zagreb from 1303 until 1322. Ka≈æotiƒá studied in Paris before returning to his homeland where he began working in the missions and preaching in modern Bosnia. He was one of the first humanist figures to appear in southern Croatia. His reputation for personal holiness remained noted long after his death; this resulted in Pope Innocent XII confirming the late bishop's beatification in 1700. Life Augustin Ka≈æotiƒá was born in 1260 in Trogir in the then-Kingdom of Dalmatia- CroatiaJohn Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 150-152. to nobles. He entered the Order of Preachers either in Trogir or in neighbouring Split in 1289 after the conclusion of his education. He completed his studies in 1287 in Paris at the college there where he was sent in 1286. Following his return from Paris he began establishing several convents and then did work in the missions in modern Bosnia and in the Hungarian kingdom. He battled against heresies during this time and got to know the papal legate Nicola Boccasini who later became pope. The two became good friends with Boccasini holding his friend in high esteem as a man of great learning and talent. Pope Benedict XI - himself a Dominican - named him as the Bishop of Zagreb (through a papal bull) in 1303 at which stage he received his episcopal consecration from the pope himself. The bishop established a cathedral school which provided free schooling to underprivileged students. The bishop also fostered learning in biblical studies as a particular focus for education. He was considerate to the poor in particular; in his actions the priest of the Catholic school was provided a regular income but the bishop forbade him to take income from his poorer students or a request services. From his own income he often turned to charitable funds and donated some of his income to the poor and vulnerable. The historian Baltazar Krƒçeliƒá suggests that while the Zagreb Cathedral was being built in 1312 there was a drought and a source of water was dug out at the present Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square at Ka≈æotiƒá's request. The source is now known as \\"Mandu≈°evac\\". Ka≈æotiƒá represented his nation's dioceses at the Council of Vienne from 1311 to 1312 which Pope Clement V had convoked in order to debate the situation regarding the Knights Templar. In 1318 he travelled to Avignon to seek assistance from Pope John XXII in regard to ongoing conflicts with King Charles Robert. Ka≈æotiƒá found himself exiled from the kingdom (and resided in Avignon with the papal court) as a result and had to wait until 1322 for the king to allow him to return to his episcopal see. During his time in Avignon he wrote a treatise on the subject of superstition in addition to divination and witchcraft. In that treatise he explained how uneducated people should not be prosecuted at the behest of the Inquisition because of their superstitions but that those people should need to be educated instead of being punished. In 1322 the pope assigned him (through a papal bull) to the restored Lucera diocese which was home to thousands of Muslim Saracens who served as Emperor Friedrich II's elite troops. Ka≈æotiƒá was given the task of rebuilding a Christian presence in Lucera. But in 1323 he had done much but to the point that his presence was problematic for some in the Muslim population. To that end a Saracen struck him in the head with an iron shaft and he died from his injuries on 3 August 1323 in the Dominican convent that he himself established. In 1947 his remains were exhumed for examination; most of his skull was still intact and he was determined to have been of slender build. Beatification Ka≈æotiƒá's holiness became pronounced in his term as bishop to the point that people came to revere him after his premature death. This later resulted in Pope Innocent XII confirming the late bishop's beatification on 17 July 1700. Some sources suggest that Pope Clement XI beatified him on 4 April 1702; this is false since Clement XI had issued a papal bull that extended public devotion to him. The cause for his canonization was re- launched in 2013 in Lucera.

He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, primarily serving in the Western Theater. Early life and career Morton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Samuel George Morton and Rebecca Pearsall, the oldest of eight children. At the age of 14, he entered the University of Pennsylvania and when he was 18, he attended the United States Military Academy, where, in 1851, he graduated 2nd in a class of 42.Callihan, David L. \\"They Did Their Work Bravely: Civil War Generals Buried in Pennsylvania\\". Heritage Books, 2004. pg. 48. He was assigned to the Corps of Engineers and was the assistant engineer of construction of forts around Charleston, SC, such as Fort Sumter, from 1851 to 1852. Afterwards, he was the assistant engineer of construction at Fort Delaware until 1855, when he returned to the United States Military Academy to teach as an assistant professor of mathematics and military engineering for two years.West, Mike. \\"Fabulous military career cut short\\".

General Books LLC, 2010. On April 1, 1854, Morton was promoted to second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. Rejecting the contemporary military strategy of the time, Morton became a strong advocate of Dennis Hart Mahan and was considered one of his best-known students. He would write essays to Secretary of War John B. Floyd regarding Mahan's principals, and on request from Floyd, evaluated Colonel Joseph Totten's plans to defend New York City. The findings were presented to Floyd in his Memoir on the Dangers and Defenses of New York City, which showed that improvement was needed.Morton, James St. Clair. \\"Memoir on the Dangers and Defense of New York City: Addressed to the Hon. John B. Floyd, Secretary of War\\". Washington: W. A. Harris, 1858. After leaving the United States Military Academy, Morton would be the chief engineer of the Sandy Hook Lighthouse district in New Jersey. Once his work there was completed, he was appointed by the Department of the Interior as chief engineer of the Washington Monument and the water works in the District of Columbia.Fitch, John. \\"Annals of the Army of the Cumberland\\". Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1864. pgs. 180-181. During this time, Morton would also be promoted to first lieutenant. In 1860, Morton was selected by the Navy Department to examine the Chiriqu√≠ Province in Central America for the possibility of a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. He concluded from his findings that it was possible, but contracted malaria while in the area. While recovering in Washington, Morton was sent in March 1861 to Dry Tortugas, Florida to act as the supervising engineer for Fort Jefferson. With the orders to put the fort into fighting condition, he attempted to help conceive a 420-gun fort and was promoted to captain on August 6, 1861. When malaria affected Morton again in early 1862, he returned to Washington to recover. Once he was well, he helped with the repairs at Fort Mifflin, Pennsylvania. Civil War In May 1862, Morton was assigned to the Army of the Ohio as chief engineer under General Don Carlos Buell. He immediately began construction of fortifications around Nashville, Tennessee and was ordered to stay and complete construction while the Army of the Ohio marched to Kentucky. The construction of these defenses, named Fort Negley, would take three months to complete and would become the largest inland masonry fort of the time.Nashville Parks and Recreation. \\"Fort Negley\\" When General Buell was relieved of command in October 1862, Morton would become chief of engineers of the Army of the Cumberland under General William S. Rosecrans. Rosecrans, who was facing engineering problems, decided to organize the Pioneer Brigade, with the intentions of forming an engineer unit. This brigade would be composed of mechanics and laborers, totaling 2,600 men. They were ordered to train in Nashville for a month and on November 29, 1862, Morton was commissioned as Brigadier General of Volunteers, a position which President Abraham Lincoln had promised him. =Stones River= In late December, about 1,700 men of the Pioneer Brigade would join the rest of the Army of the Cumberland on its march to Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Arriving on the outskirts of the city on the 29th, they were ordered to build bridges and abatis, to clear roads, and improve fords. On the morning of the 31st, the Pioneer Brigade was positioned to the rear of the Union army. Around mid-day, the brigade was ordered forward to support Captain James Stokes' Chicago Board of Trade Battery, which was positioned on a small knoll west of the Nashville Turnpike, behind the center of the Union lines. Upon arriving, they witnessed hundreds of fleeing soldiers, with the Confederate forces reforming for another attack. The Pioneer Brigade was immediately behind the front lines now and from their position, had a clear view of open ground in front of them, offering Stokes' battery a deadly advantage. When the Confederates launched the attack, Morton ordered Stokes' battery to open fire with canister, which effectively drove the attackers away. He then advanced to a rise and held it under the fire of enemy artillery. Stones River, January 2nd, 1863 This repulse helped General Rosecrans buy time as he regrouped stragglers and brought up fresh units to reform the line. While he was doing this, three more charges were thrust upon the forward line, with the last charge finally breaking them, causing them to retreat back to the turnpike. Morton had his brigade form upon Stokes' battery again. Once Rosecrans had formed a new line, the Pioneer Brigade and Stokes' battery were re-adjusted to fit the line, being moved to the front of the turnpike and the right of the new line. Additional troops that had been rallied were brought to the right of Morton. As the front line continued to withdraw, they appeared from the woods directly in front of Morton and then slowly took refuge behind his lines. The Confederates, still in pursuit, began to appear from the woods, allowing Stokes' battery to open fire with canister. Morton rode to the front of his troops and said, \\"Men, you haven't much ammunition, but give them what you have and then wade in on \`em with the bayonets!\\" With that, the lines were ordered to stand and open fire, putting gaps into the oncoming Confederate lines. The lines wavered and then began to withdraw. Upon seeing the success, Rosecrans order the brigade to charge forward and occupy the fields just outside the woods. The Confederates rallied three times and pressed forward again, but each time, were forced back. The following day brought the New Year, with only minor skirmishing. The Pioneer Brigade was ordered to the rear and allowed to rest. On January 2, Confederate General John C. Breckinridge attacked the Union left center and was successful in capturing a number of guns. As the Pioneer Brigade moved towards the action, the Confederates had already begun retreating, and Morton had his brigade participate in their pursuit. The Confederates withdrew from the city on the 4th, leaving the Union victorious. Morton would report 12 killed and 23 wounded. In addition, Stokes' battery had 3 killed and 10 wounded.Blakenmeyer, Geoffrey L., \\"The Pioneer Brigade\\" After the battle, Morton supervised the construction of Fortress Rosecrans, doing so until June 1863. Covering 200 acres, these earthworks would become the largest fort built during the Civil War. =Tullahoma Campaign and Chickamauga= While Morton and the Pioneer Brigade did not have a large role in the Tullahoma Campaign, their record would be marred by some incidents that occurred, including drunkenness among the ranks. He would also be reprimanded for delaying General Alexander McCook's XX Corps, which got stuck behind the Pioneer Brigade. McCook would personally take this to Rosecrans, who would scold Morton in front of other officers while at his headquarters. Despite this, Morton was promoted to major in the Regular Army on July 3, 1863. During the Battle of Chickamauga, the Pioneer Brigade fell into the wrong place again, this time in front of retreating Union troops. Morton had been ordered to survey the front by Rosecrans, and after getting separated from the General, found himself among General McCook's troops, which were to the right of General James Longstreet's breakthrough of the Union lines. Morton and the Pioneer Brigade soon got caught up in the retreat, despite having just been pulled up. This embarrassment to the army brought about a number of demotions and transfers. Morton, who had been slightly wounded while standing near Rosecrans during the battle, was not immediately relieved of his command. However, on October 10, he was relieved and General William Farrar Smith took his place. After seeking a transfer, which was denied, Morton requested that he be reduced in rank, from his volunteer rank of brigadier general to his Regular Army rank of major. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on November 7, 1863 Returning to Nashville on November 14, he served as the supervising engineer of construction of defenses in the area until January 30, 1864. Following this, he would act as assistant to the Chief Engineer in Washington until May. Death Morton returned to the field in May, serving as the Chief Engineer in the IX Corps under General Ambrose Burnside. On June 17, 1864, during the Second Battle of Petersburg, Morton was surveying the area in front of General Orlando B. Willcox's division, which was about to attack, when he was shot in the chest and killed. His body was returned to Philadelphia and he was buried with military honors at Laurel Hill Cemetery. Following his death, Morton received the following posthumous brevets in the Regular Army: *Brevet Lieutenant Colonel ‚Äì for gallant and meritorious services at the Battle of Stones River, Tennessee (January 2, 1863) *Brevet Colonel ‚Äì for good conduct at Chickamauga, Georgia (September 20, 1863) *Brevet Brigadier General ‚Äì for gallant and meritorious services at the assault on Petersburg, Virginia (June 17, 1864) References 1824 births 1864 deaths Burials at Laurel Hill Cemetery (Philadelphia) Union Army generals United States Military Academy alumni Union military personnel killed in the American Civil War Military personnel from Philadelphia People of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Deaths by firearm in Virginia ","title":"James St. Clair Morton"},{"id":"28989870","text":"A partnership limited by shares is a hybrid between a partnership and a limited liability company.

When in 1992 the 12 meters high steel sculpture New Star consisting of five parts, which was already created in 1986/87 by the US-Artist Mark di Suvero, was first erected on loan on the Diergardt-Place, a storm of protest against it arose via letters to the editor of the local paper by Viersen citizens. This example of modern art was too alien to many of them.R.L. Bunk, Peter Kastner: Mark di Suvero. ‚ÄûNew Star‚Äú in der Skulpturensammlung zu Viersen. Viersen 1992. Meanwhile repeated information over the artists and their works, the international acceptance of the exhibition shown by numerous visitors form all over Germany, as well as other countries and extensive media coverage have led to a change of heart among the citizenry.  Significance and works  A special attraction within the collection is the bronze Articulated column by the English artist Tony Cragg (1996), which was created especially for the Viersen Sculpture Park.Peter Kastner: Anthony Cragg. ‚ÄûWirbels√§ule ‚Äì the articulated column‚Äú in der Skulpturensammlung Viersen. 1996.

Career As winner of Australia's Next Top Model, Cycle 6, Ware was due to appear on the cover of Harper's Bazaar Australia, but the magazine editor decided to publish half the November issue with Ware and half with the runner-up, Kelsey Martinovich, who was incorrectly announced as the winner by host Sarah Murdoch. During the course of the show Ware won a campaign with Bonds as well as a campaign with Levi's that was included in her prize. In 2010 she signed a three-year contract with Elite Model Management in New York City after a successful one week visit. In August 2011 Ware ended her contract with Elite and signed with S Models. For her runway debut at New York Fashion Week Fall 2011, Ware walked for a total of 6 shows that included Phillip Lim, L'Wren Scott, and Chado Ralph Rucci. In her first full season, Ware walked for a total of 17 shows. At New York Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2012, she walked for BCBG by Max Azria, Carlos Miele, Herv√© L√©ger, Monique Lhuillier, L'Wren Scott and Ruffian.

The Hope Slide is named after the Hope Slide, a rock slide that occurred early in the morning of January 9, 1965. History The Hope Slide's self-titled debut album, released September 28, 2010 on Submerged Records, is something of a concept album befitting the band‚Äôs chosen name. The songs deal with disasters and upheavals of all kinds, including the ill-fated Franklin Expedition (\\"Passage\\"), the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 (\\"In Ashe\\"), the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster on the surrounding ecosystem (\\"Red Forest\\"). \\"In Ashe\\" was inspired by a landmark event in the history of workers‚Äô rights, \\"Parish\\" confronts the U.S. government's failed response to Hurricane Katrina, and \\"Topple the Sky\\" deals with the 2009‚Äì2010 Iranian election protests. Writing in the Brock Press, Marshal Hignett described The Hope Slide as \\"an astounding debut release which is bound to have a tremendous impact on the Canadian electronic scene in the future.\\" The British blog indie-mp3.co.uk noted that the duo's music is \\"not shoegaze in it‚Äôs classic sense but is more in line with the ambient electrical stuff put out by the likes of M83 and Ulrich Schnauss.\\" SlowdiveMusic Blog called the album \\"a journey through grandiose soundscapes, overwhelming undertows, and brilliant craftsmanship\\", declaring it \\"the dreampop/shoegaze monument of the year\\". The Hope Slide's members, Michaela Galloway (vocals, Moog) and John Lucas (guitar, bass, keyboards, beats), were formerly in Hinterland, a band that, through its eight-year, three-album run, consistently made the Canadian college-radio charts, performed all over the country (including on a nationally broadcast TV show), and generally built a cult following. Whereas Hinterland was a five-piece rock band, however, the Hope Slide leans more toward the electronic end of things, albeit with all the moody dream-pop atmospherics for which Lucas and Galloway are known. On October 19, 2010, Submerged Records released The Hope Slide Remixed, a free five-song EP, featuring remixes by Vigestol (aka Geoff Nilson, formerly of Way to Go, Einstein), the Ludvico Treatment, Area Man, Sinewave, and Killsaly.

Situated 55 km west of Jelenia G√≥ra, 80 km east of Dresden, Germany, and 20 km northwest of Liberec, Czech Republic, the Tur√≥w mine forms a part of an area widely known as the \\"Black Triangle\\" due to its past heavy industrial pollution, covering portions of eastern Germany, southwestern Poland and northern Czech Republic. The Tur√≥w mine, operated by Polska Grupa Energetyczna, represents one of the largest lignite reserves in Poland, with an estimated reserve of 760 million tonnes in coal. The annual coal production of Tur√≥w is around 27.7 million tonnes. Lignite was found near Turas√≥w in 1740. Between 1836 and 1869, almost 70 shafts were excavated. The owners of these mines organized the joint stock company Hercules in 1904, and three years later began strip mining. In 1925 the cap rock was dumped north to the mine. After the Second World War, in 1947, a Polish organization took the mine over from the Russian military administration and the KWB Tur√≥w came into existence. In 2005 its lignite resources were 429.7 x 106 t. The mine's license was set to expire in April 2020, but in March 2020, the Polish government extended it by another six years. The company which operates the complex, PGE Group, wants to continue mining at the site until 2044, as well as expanding the site significantly. The move to expand is facing opposition from the Czech government, as nearby Czech and German communities say that the environmental impact from the mine is severely affecting their quality of life.

The proteostasis network includes competing and integrated biological pathways within cells that control the biogenesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins present within and outside the cell. Loss of proteostasis is central to understanding the cause of diseases associated with excessive protein misfolding and degradation leading to loss-of-function phenotypes, as well as aggregation-associated degenerative disorders. Therapeutic restoration of proteostasis may treat or resolve these pathologies. Cellular proteostasis is key to ensuring successful development, healthy aging, resistance to environmental stresses, and to minimize homeostatic perturbations from pathogens such as viruses. Cellular mechanisms for maintaining proteostasis include regulated protein translation, chaperone assisted protein folding, and protein degradation pathways. Adjusting each of these mechanisms based the need for specific proteins is essential to maintain all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome.  Mechanisms of proteostasis  =The roles of the ribosome in proteostasis = One of the first points of regulation for proteostasis is during translation. This is accomplished via the structure of the ribosome, a complex central to translation. These two characteristics shape the way the protein folds and influences the proteins future interactions. The synthesis of a new peptide chain using the ribosome is very slow and the ribosome can even be stalled when it encounters a rare codon, a codon found at low concentrations in the cell. These pauses provide an opportunity for an individual protein domain to have the necessary time to become folded before the production of following domains. This facilitates the correct folding of multi-domain proteins. The newly synthesized peptide chain exits the ribosome into the cellular environment through the narrow ribosome exit channel (width: 10√Ö to 20√Ö, length 80√Ö). Due to space restriction in the exit channel the nascent chain already forms secondary and limited tertiary structures. For example, an alpha helix is one such structural property that is commonly induced in this exit channel. At the same time the exit channel also prevents premature folding by impeding large scale interactions within the peptide chain which would require more space. = Molecular chaperones and post-translational maintenance in proteostasis = In order to maintain protein homeostasis post- translationally, the cell makes use of molecular chaperones sometimes including chaperonins, which aid in the assembly or disassembly of proteins. They recognize exposed segments of hydrophobic amino acids in the nascent peptide chain and then work to promote the proper formation of noncovalent interactions that lead to the desired folded state. Chaperones begin to assist in protein folding as soon as a nascent chain longer than 60 amino acids emerges from the ribosome exit channel. One of the most studied ribosome binding chaperones is trigger factor. Trigger factor works to stabilize the peptide, promotes its folding, prevents aggregation, and promotes refolding of denatured model substrates. Trigger factor not only directly works to properly fold the protein but also recruits other chaperones to the ribosome, such as Hsp70. Hsp70 surrounds an unfolded peptide chain, thereby preventing aggregation and promoting folding. Chaperonins are a special class of chaperones that promote native state folding by cyclically encapsulating the peptide chain. Chaperonins are divided into two groups. Group 1 chaperonins are commonly found in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. Group 2 chaperonins are found in both the cytosol of eukaryotic cells as well as in archaea. Group 2 chaperonins also contain an additional helical component which acts as a lid for the cylindrical protein chamber, unlike Group 1 which instead relies on an extra cochaperone to act as a lid. All chaperonins exhibit two states (open and closed), between which they can cycle. This cycling process is important during the folding of an individual polypeptide chain as it helps to avoid undesired interactions as well as to prevent the peptide from entering into kinetically trapped states. = Regulating proteostasis by protein degradation = The third component of the proteostasis network is the protein degradation machinery. Protein degradation occurs in proteostasis when the cellular signals indicate the need to decrease overall cellular protein levels. The effects of protein degradation can be local, with the cell only experiencing effects from the loss of the degraded protein itself or widespread, with the entire protein landscape changing due to loss of other proteins‚Äô interactions with the degraded protein. Multiple substrates are targets for proteostatic degradation. These degradable substrates include nonfunctional protein fragments produced from ribosomal stalling during translation, misfolded or unfolded proteins, aggregated proteins, and proteins that are no longer needed to carry out cellular function. Several different pathways exist for carrying out these degradation processes. When proteins are determined to be unfolded or misfolded, they are typically degraded via the unfolded protein response (UPR) or endoplasmic- reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Substrates that are unfolded, misfolded, or no longer required for cellular function can also be ubiquitin tagged for degradation by ATP dependent proteases, such as the proteasome in eukaryotes or ClpXP in prokaryotes. Autophagy, or self engulfment, lysosomal targeting, and phagocytosis (engulfment of waste products by other cells) can also be used as proteostatic degradation mechanisms.  Signaling events in proteostasis  Protein misfolding is detected by mechanisms that are specific for the cellular compartment in which they occur. Distinct surveillance mechanisms that respond to unfolded protein have been characterized in the cytoplasm, ER and mitochondria. This response acts locally in a cell autonomous fashion but can also extend to intercellular signaling to protect the organism from anticipated proteotoxic stress. = Cell-autonomous stress responses = Cellular stress response pathways detect and alleviate proteotoxic stress which is triggered by imbalances in proteostasis. The cell- autonomous regulation occurs through direct detection of misfolded proteins or inhibition of pathway activation by sequestering activating components in response to heat shock. Cellular responses to this stress signaling include transcriptional activation of chaperone expression, increased efficiency in protein trafficking and protein degradation and translational reduction. Proteostasis stress signaling response = Cytosolic heat shock response = The cytosolic HSR is mainly mediated by the transcription factor family HSF (heat shock family). HSF is constitutively bound by Hsp90. Upon a proteotoxic stimulus Hsp90 is recruited away from HSF which can then bind to heat response elements in the DNA and upregulate gene expression of proteins involved in the maintenance of proteostasis. = ER unfolded protein response = The unfolded protein response in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) is activated by imbalances of unfolded proteins inside the ER and the proteins mediating protein homeostasis. Different ‚Äúdetectors‚Äù - such as IRE1, ATF6 and PERK - can recognize misfolded proteins in the ER and mediate transcriptional responses which help alleviate the effects of ER stress. = Mitochondrial unfolded protein response = The mitochondrial unfolded protein response detects imbalances in protein stoichiometry of mitochondrial proteins and misfolded proteins. The expression of mitochondrial chaperones is upregulated by the activation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and/or DVE-1 with UBL-5. = Systemic stress signaling = Stress responses can also be triggered in a non- cell autonomous fashion by intercellular communication. The stress that is sensed in one tissue could thereby be communicated to other tissues to protect the proteome of the organism or to regulate proteostasis systemically. Cell non-autonomous activation can occur for all three stress responses. Work on the model organism C. elegans has shown that neurons play a role in this intercellular communication of cytosolic HSR. Stress induced in the neurons of the worm can in the long run protect other tissues such as muscle and intestinal cells from chronic proteotoxicity. Similarly ER and mitochondrial UPR in neurons are relayed to intestinal cells . These systemic responses have been implicated in mediating not only systemic proteostasis but also influence organismal aging.  Diseases of proteostasis  = Proteostasis and diseases of protein folding = Dysfunction in proteostasis can arise from errors in or misregulation of protein folding. The classic examples are missense mutations and deletions that change the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the protein folding process. These mutations are often inherited and range in phenotypic severity from having no noticeable effect to embryonic lethality. Disease develops when these mutations render a protein significantly more susceptible to misfolding, aggregation, and degradation. If these effects only alter the mutated protein, the negative consequences will only be local loss of function. However, if these mutations occur in a chaperone or a protein that interacts with many other proteins, dramatic global alterations in the proteostasis boundary will occur. Examples of diseases resulting from proteostatic changes from errors in protein folding include cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and others. = The role of model systems in the elucidation of protein-misfolding diseases = Small animal model systems have been and continue to be instrumental in the identification of functional mechanisms that safeguard proteostasis. Model systems of diverse misfolding-prone disease proteins have so far revealed numerous chaperone and co-chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity. = Proteostasis and cancer = The unregulated cell division that marks cancer development requires increased protein synthesis for cancer cell function and survival. This increased protein synthesis is typically seen in proteins that modulate cell metabolism and growth processes. Cancer cells are sometimes susceptible to drugs that inhibit chaperones and disrupt proteostasis, such as Hsp90 inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, cancer cells tend to produce misfolded proteins, which are removed mainly by proteolysis. Inhibitors of proteolysis allow accumulation of both misfolded protein aggregates, as well as apoptosis signaling proteins in cancer cells. This can change the sensitivity of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs; cancer cells either die at a lower drug concentration, or survive, depending on the type of proteins that accumulate, and the function these proteins have. Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was the first drug of this type to receive approval for treatment of multiple myeloma. = Proteostasis and obesity = A hallmark of cellular proteostatic networks is their ability to adapt to stress via protein regulation. Metabolic disease, such as that associated with obesity, alters the ability of cellular proteostasis networks adapt to stress, often with detrimental health effects. For example, when insulin production exceeds the cell's insulin secretion capacity, proteostatic collapse occurs and chaperone production is severely impaired. This disruption leads to the disease symptoms exhibited in individuals with diabetes. = Proteostasis and aging = Over time, the proteostasis network becomes burdened with proteins modified by reactive oxygen species and metabolites that induce oxidative damage. These byproducts can react with cellular proteins to cause misfolding and aggregation (especially in nondividing cells like neurons). This risk is particularly high for intrinsically disordered proteins. The IGFR-1 pathway has been shown in C. elegans to protect against these harmful aggregates, and some experimental work has suggested that upregulation of insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) may stabilize proteostatic network and prevent detrimental effects of aging. Expression of the chaperome, the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular folding machines to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Functional assays in C. elegans and human cells have identified a conserved chaperome sub-network of 16 chaperone genes, corresponding to 28 human orthologs as a proteostasis safeguard in aging and age-onset neurodegenerative disease. = Pharmacologic intervention in proteostasis = There are two main approaches that have been used for therapeutic development targeting the proteostatic network: pharmacologic chaperones and proteostasis regulators. The principle behind designing pharmacologic chaperones for intervention in diseases of proteostasis is to design small molecules that stabilize proteins exhibiting borderline stability. Previously, this approach has been used to target and stabilize G-protein coupled receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, glycosidases, lysosomal storage proteins, and the mutant CFTR protein that causes cystic fibrosis and transthyretin, which can misfiled and aggregate leading to amyloidoses. Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer sell regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperones for ameliorating cystic fibrosis and the transthyretin amyloidoses, respectively. Amicus sells a regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperone for Fabry disease‚Äìa lysosomal storage disease. The principle behind proteostasis regulators is different, these molecules alter the biology of protein folding and / or degradation by altering the stoichiometry of the proteostasis network components in a given sub cellular compartment. For example, some proteostasis regulators initiate stress responsive signaling, such as the unfolded protein response, which transcriptionally reprograms the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network. It has been suggested that this approach could even be applied prophylactically, such as upregulating certain protective pathways before experiencing an anticipated severe cellular stress. One theoretical mechanism for this approach includes upregulating the heat shock response response to rescue proteins from degradation during cellular stress.

Built in 1928, it was a replacement for the older Fuller's Opera House and was originally designed for vaudeville acts. Its architect Henry Eli White also designed many other famous theatres in Australia and New Zealand including the St James Theatre in Wellington and the State Theatre in Sydney. The theatre has been closed since 2007 after a fire raised concerns about safety and compliance. Purchased by Relianz Holdings in 2014, it is a restoration project with an Auckland Council contribution of $15 million. Buildings on the adjacent sites were demolished by late-2016 to make way for the St James Suites, a 39-level, 309-apartment project. However, in July 2019, no work had been done on the theatre since 2015 after funding for the apartment complex was lost. The theatre is classified as a \\"Category I\\" (\\"places of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value\\") historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Construction The St James Theatre was commissioned by John Fuller and Sons Limited to replace Fuller's Opera House which burned down in 1926. The site on Queen Street opposite Civic Square was acquired for around ¬£100,000; construction of the theatre was estimated to cost around ¬£80,000. Construction was completed in 1928, and the theatre was originally targeted for the performance of vaudeville acts. Upon its completion, the eldest brother of the Fuller family, Sir Benjamin Fuller, pronounced St James to be \\"the theatre perfect\\". The theatre's grand opening was on 5 July 1928 with the London Musical Company performing Archie. The St. James Theatre was designed by architect Henry Eli White for its owners Sir Benjamin Fuller and his brother John Fuller. White was responsible for a number of theatres in Australia and New Zealand, including the St. James Theatre, Sydney. This was also built for the Fullers, who owned a significant theatre and retail businesses across the two countries.Heritage et AL: St. James Theatre At the time the St. James was designed, live performance was dominated by vaudeville: musical and comic entertainment. The St. James was quickly adapted to the newly popular ‚Äòtalking pictures‚Äô however, with the addition of a film projector 18 months after opening. The St. James has accommodated live performance and/or film during different periods of its lifetime. Renovations The St James has undergone several major modifications since its construction. A year after it was finished, cinema projectors were added due to the popularity of cinema. Cinema was to become a major part of the St James; its first film screening was Gold Diggers of Broadway, shown on Boxing Day 1929. In 1953, the building's facade and vestibule underwent renovation for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, who attended a cinema premiere screening in December of that year. As part of the renovations, the unique facade was hidden behind sheets of metal in an attempt to give the building a more modern look. However, its Spanish-Renaissance style interior is well preserved. The main auditorium has three tiers of seating plus boxes, elaborate lighting and ornate plasterwork decoration; items of heritage value include statuettes, the terrazzo flooring and the grand marble staircase. In 1957, the Odeon Cinema with 670 seats was added to the theatre complex. In 1966 further modifications were made to the Queen Street facade; in 1966 the Westend Cinema was added, the Regent Theatre was added in 1982. Use and notable performers While active, the theatre hosted many famous performers such as theatrical actors Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson. The Black and White Minstrel Show performed in 1963. In 1972 the successful West End musical play Charlie Girl performed at the St James with its original cast. The 1981 Royal Command Performance was held at St James for the visiting Queen Elizabeth II, Sir Howard Morrison held a premier performance of his te reo MƒÅori version of the song How Great Thou Art that launched his commercial success. Closure, proposals and restoration project In 2007, a fire damaged the theatre and it has not been open to the public since then. Any new work to restore the building would require earthquake proofing according to Auckland City Council's building standards, adding to the cost of any future restoration of the theatre. A 39-storey apartment building next to the theatre was approved by Auckland City Council in 2009. The owner of the St James and the developer behind the planned construction, Paul Doole, stated that the cost to restore and to reopen the theatre was estimated to be around $50 million. A 2010 proposal was for the St. James to be restored as part of a new Convention Centre. (Brian Rudman, ‚ÄòSt James Theatre restoration would be sweet music to the ears of many‚Äô. New Zealand Herald, 9 August 2010, pA7). In 2014, the theatre was purchased by Relianz Holdings who confirmed plans to restore it and build the St James Suites apartments on the adjacent site by as early as 2018, but by July 2019 repairs were at a standstill after a bank withdrew $90 million worth of funding for the apartment complex. The theatre was to have made use of access routes and public conveniences in the complex, and restoration work cannot proceed until these issues are addressed. Historical significance The St James building is classified as a \\"Category I\\" (\\"places of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value\\") historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Excerpts from the Historic Places Trust register read as follows: :The St James has been a major focus of social life in Auckland for the best part of a century. It has been the venue for many important cinematic and theatrical events held for many royal and important occasions. :Norman Hayward, manager from 1935, came from a strong family background of theatre and cinema. Under Hayward the theatrical atmosphere of the St James was enhanced, the patrons were entertained by piano playing in the foyer during the interval and informed by the weekly newsreels, entitled 'The St James Airmail Review'. During this period Fullers picked up the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract and the St James became the MGM theatre of Auckland. :In 1945, Kerridge Theatres Ltd bought all Fuller cinemas, including the St James. With Kerridge came the return of stage shows, including, from overseas, Charlie Girl, a West End production brought over in its entirety, the Bolshoi Ballet Company, and New Zealand shows, the Royal Variety Performance, and the New Zealand Ballet Company, amongst others. The large seating capacity has made it economic to bring large shows to Auckland for the last fifty years. Of all the Queen Street theatres built for live shows, the St James is the only remaining one. St James Saviours The St James Saviours is a lobby group formed in 2010 by Bob Kerridge, the son of ex-owner of the St James, Sir Robert Kerridge. Members include Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Alan Bennett and over 7,000 supporters on Facebook. Patron of the St James Saviours is Auckland Mayor Len Brown, who in early 2011 commissioned a study to identify the need and market demand for professional performing arts venues in Auckland, and to help guide Auckland Council's investment in such venues over the next 10 to 15 years. In September 2012 David Hartnell MNZM was named Ambassador of the St James Saviours.

Perry (1894-1960) was a prominent African-American attorney who served as assistant attorney general for the State of Illinois. He is also the father of stage director Shauneille Perry and uncle of playwright Lorraine Hansberry. Biography According to the 1900 U.S. Census, Perry was born in April 1894 (some sources indicate either April 22, 1897 or April 22, 1900) in Columbia, Tennessee, the youngest child of the Rev. George W. Perry, an escaped former slave, and Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Organ. He received his elementary and secondary school education in Columbia, then attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1923, he received the degree of juris doctor from the Northwestern University School of Law. He was very active in civil rights, having served as vice president of the Chicago branch of the NAACP. He also served on the board of the Chicago branch of the Urban League. In 1941, he was elected to the post of assistant attorney general for the State of Illinois. After Nathan K. McGill, he was one of the first African Americans to hold that position in the state. No African American would serve as a state's attorney general until Edward Brooke was elected Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1962. Perry served as an assistant attorney general from 1942 to 1950, and specialized in military and labor-related issues. This included cases involving the reinstatement of veterans to positions they held prior to military service. During World War Two, Perry helped enforce anti- discrimination requirements with firms holding war contracts. In January 1948, he was chosen by the Republican party as a candidate for judge in Chicago's Municipal court. Despite a strong showing by U.S. presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey at the top of the ticket, the Chicago Democrats had a clean sweep of the local election in November of that year. Perry received a total of 638,689 votes and tied for twenty-first place out of 33 candidates for twelve positions. In 1953, Perry was appointed assistant United States attorney to handle cases involving military conscientious objectors. He was working in a similar capacity for the northern district of Illinois at the time of his death. He died on September 9, 1960 at his home in Chicago. and is buried at the Burr Oak Cemetery near Chicago.

The announcement received support from companies including Novell, Red Hat, Canonical and Google. In December 2010, The Document Foundation announced that the BrOffice Centre of Excellence for Free Software, the organization behind BrOffice joined the Foundation. The Foundation also made available a re- branded fork of OpenOffice.org which was based on the upcoming 3.3 version, with patches and build software from the Go-oo fork. It was hoped that the LibreOffice name would be provisional as Oracle was invited to become a member of The Document Foundation, and was asked to donate the OpenOffice.org brand to the project. Following the announcement, Oracle asked members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council who were members of The Document Foundation to step down from the Council, claiming that this represented a conflict of interest, leaving the community council composed 100% of Oracle employees.

They were later joined by The Surfer's Path and Dig BMX.Factory Media The magazine‚Äôs name, which plays on freeride snowboarding and drugs culture, was originally spelt out as two words (White Lines). Over the years - for the sake of a simpler logo and the website URL - it has merged to become Whitelines. At the time of its launch, the only other British snowboard magazine on the shelves was Snowboard UK. Initially something of a fanzine, Whitelines targeted a core readership, differentiating itself from the competition through its forthright opinions and an irreverent sense of humour. Early articles included ‚ÄòFreak Speak‚Äô (in which the editor interviewed Oxford‚Äôs local tramps), a tour of the UK‚Äôs best rollercoasters and an in depth tutorial on ‚ÄòHow to drive like The Sweeney‚Äô. Tudor ‚ÄòChod‚Äô Thomas now admits that these were partly included for lack of actual snowboarding photos.

Other members of the Whitelines editorial team have included the BBC‚Äôs Ski Sunday presenter Ed Leigh and photographer James McPhail. Whitelines is also credited with kick-starting the photographic career of Nick Hamilton, who worked as a staffer at Permanent Publishing alongside skate lensman Wig Worland before leaving Whitelines to become photo editor at Transworld Snowboarding. Over the years Whitelines has developed from its early fanzine style to a respected snowboard journal, and regularly features the work of some of the best international snowboard photographers, including Jeff Curtes, Blotto, Andy Wright and Scott Serfas. Regular columnists have included pro snowboarders Devun Walsh and David Benedek. In 2005, Benedek chose a cover-mounted DVD on Whitelines as the means to distribute his acclaimed film, ‚Äò91 Words for Snow‚Äô, in the UK. Whitelines has helped spawn the careers of many of Britain‚Äôs professional snowboarders, such as Danny Wheeler, Tyler Chorlton, Jenny Jones, Dan Wakeham, Scott McMorris, Dom Harington, Ben Kilner and Jamie Nicholls. It has also taken riders to many unusual snowboarding destinations, including Greenland, the Lebanon, Iran, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kashmir. In 2007, the magazine joined Factory Media as part of the merger of three leading specialist sports publishers: Action Sports Media (ASM), Permanent Publishing and 4130 Publishing. It was based in Farringdon, London. Final Issue The final issue of Whitelines was the March 2015 version (#120). At the time of Ed Blomfield leaving the magazine it was expected to continue in print, however the owners Factory Media announced in the summer of 2015 that print production would cease and they would live on in digital format via the whitelines.com website. Awards In 2007 Ed Blomfield was named New Editor of the Year at the PTC New Journalist Awards. In 2010 Whitelines won ‚ÄòBest Cover‚Äô in the sports category of the Maggies Awards. The winning cover, from issue 82, was shot in Iceland and featured British snowboarder Colum Mytton. It was designed by former WL art director Nick Butterfield.

He was born in Winchester, but spent all his adult life in Sidmouth, Devon. Hutchinson was a polymath whose interests ranged from politics to the preservation of telephone poles. He was also an amateur musician (flute and French horn) as well as a stonecarver. His major achievement, however, was a series of diaries and sketchbooks, containing observations on the geology, archaeology, botany and other items of interest relating to East Devon. In his capacity as a stonecarver, he helped to save and restore the Old Chancel in Sidmouth. He was on the Committee for the restoration of the parish church in 1860, but felt that not enough of the original building was being preserved, so he bought and re-erected the chancel in his own garden, later attaching it to his house. He was also a great- grandson of Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson of Boston Tea Party fame. In 1837-38 he visited the United States and Canada, where he made over a hundred sketches. In 1880, he helped organize and publish his great- grandfather's papers.

He had previously served in Burma for many years as Deputy Conservator of Forests, and Game Warden. Early life Edgar Peacock was born in Nagpur, India on 11 February 1893. He entered the Indian Forest Service in 1914, training at the Forest Research Institute College at Dehra Dun and, upon graduation, took up his first posting in the Hinthada area. In 1924, Peacock married his wife, Geraldine, in Rangoon, and then returned to his work as a Forest Officer. This included lengthy tours in the jungle on which his wife and new baby, Joy, accompanied him. In 1932, Peacock retired from the forestry service and travelled to England with his family. They stayed there for six months while he wrote a book, A Game Book for Burma and Adjoining Territories, which was published in 1933 by H F & G Witherby and he also wrote a number of articles for The Field magazine, on both hunting and photographing game. War Service Peacock served with SOE during the Second World War, largely in Burma where he commanded P-Force in the Chindwin River area, assisting 20 Division of IV Corps. P Force was withdrawn just before the Japanese attack on India in March 1944. After further training in Ceylon at the end of 1944, Peacock led Otter area of Operation Character, with responsibility for the foothills and the road leading east from Toungoo towards Bawlake. Here, his responsibility was to \\"train, plan and lead the Karens into their first action and show them how to do it.\\" During operations on the Chindwin front, Peacock was awarded a Military Cross after an incident in which one of his officers, Captain J Gibson, was seriously wounded by a grenade.

It was founded as the second, or East, Kent County Asylum in 1872. In 1948 the hospital became part of the National Health Service and was renamed St Augustine's Hospital. The hospital gained notoriety in the 1970s when it was the subject of a committee of inquiry into malpractice and mismanagement. St Augustine's Hospital closed in 1993 and the site is now occupied by housing, although a few of the original hospital buildings remain. History =Lunatic asylum= When it became clear in the early 1870s that the Kent County Asylum at Barming Heath, Maidstone, was no longer large enough to accommodate all the county's pauper lunatics, a search began for a site for a second county asylum as the 1845 Lunacy Act had made it obligatory to provide asylums. A site on Chartham Downs three miles south-west of Canterbury was chosen. It satisfied the requirements set down by the Commissioners in Lunacy: a site on elevated ground with cheerful prospects and enough space to provide employment and recreation for inmates while preventing them being overlooked or disturbed by strangers.1844 report of Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy, quoted in J. Taylor 1991 Hospital and asylum architecture in England, 1840-1914, p 25 The competition for the design of the buildings was won by the London firm of architects J. Giles and Gough. John Giles was one of the most successful asylum architects, winning eight of the sixteen competitions he entered and coming second in four.J. Taylor 1991 Hospital and asylum architecture in England, 1840-1914, p 153 The buildings were completed in 1876 at a total cost of ¬£211,852. Originally built to house 870 patients, the hospital gradually expanded and by 1948 had 300 acres, including a farm, and 73 staff residences, as well as new blocks and facilities for patients.National Archives Kent Lunatic Asylum/St. Augustine's Hospital, Chartham: administrative history Eventually there would be 2,000 patients.R. Allen 1990 History of a hospital (St Augustine's Hospital, Chartham). Bygone Kent 11(12):698-704 Although the initial building programme was not completed until 1876, the first patients, all of them pauper lunatics from the Kent County Asylum at Barming Heath, had been able to move in the previous year. The first medical superintendent was Robert Spencer. The asylum was originally managed by a committee of quarter sessions, with responsibility passing to Kent County Council in 1889. In 1920 Kent County Mental Hospitals Committee took over the management and the asylum was renamed Kent County Mental Hospital, Chartham. The hospital became a self-contained village, with its own farm, workshops, baker, butcher, fire-brigade, church, graveyard, gasworks, cricket team, band, etc. Male patients worked on the farm, while female patients worked in the laundry or as seamstresses. During the First World War, the asylum took in patients from other parts of the country, when their hospitals were being used for military casualties. After the end of the war they had a number of service patients (there were 37 in 1922), ex-servicemen who had special privileges.Hansard, 30 March 1922 During the second world war, part of the hospital was taken over by the Emergency Medical Service for military use. =An NHS hospital= In 1948 the hospital became part of the newly formed National Health Service (NHS) and was renamed St Augustine's Hospital. Together with St Martin's Hospital (the former Canterbury borough asylum), St Augustine‚Äôs became the responsibility of the Canterbury and Thanet Health Authority. New treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery were used at the hospital. The hospital achieved a brief moment of fame in 1969 when a nurse, Barbara Bishop, was awarded an MBE after a daring rooftop rescue of a suicidal patient.The Times, 10 December 1969, p 2 In 1972, when the hospital was under the leadership of medical superintendent John Ainslie, a post-doctorate researcher in chemistry called Brian Ankers (from the nearby University of Kent) obtained a temporary job as a nursing assistant. Ankers became concerned about the ill treatment of patients on the long-stay wards and, together with nurse Olleste Weston, took the matter up with the hospital authorities.The Times, 31 March 1976, p 1 Their concerns were dismissed, so they produced a detailed critique of the hospital, detailing 70 instances of abuse, neglect and degrading treatment of patients, thus forcing the health authority to set up an inquiry.L. Swaffield 1981 Four mental hospitals revisited - 4: St Augustine's - a breath of fresh air. Nursing Times 77(48):2061-6 The inquiry, chaired by J. Hampden Inskip, upheld the majority of the complaints and was critical of senior doctors, nurses, and administrators, but stopped short of advising disciplinary action against any staff.R.

In 1997 development of the site for housing was begun. A few of the hospital buildings, including the administration block, the water tower, and the chapel, were retained but the rest were demolished.

It is used as a plasticizer and stabilizer in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. ESBO is a yellowish viscous liquid. Manufacturing process Epoxidized linolein, a major component of ESBO. ESBO is manufactured from soybean oil through the process of epoxidation. Polyunsaturated vegetable oils are widely used as precursors to epoxidized oil products because they have high numbers of carbon-carbon double bonds available for epoxidation. The epoxide group is more reactive than double bond, thus providing a more energetically favorable site for reaction and making the oil a good hydrochloric acid scavenger and plasticizer. Usually a peroxide or a peracid is used to add an atom of oxygen and convert the -C=C- bond to an epoxide group. Uses Food products that are stored in glass jars are usually sealed with gaskets made from PVC. ESBO is one of the additives in the PVC gasket. It serves as a plasticizer and a scavenger for hydrochloric acid released when the PVC degrades thermally, e.g. when the gasket is applied to the lid and food product undergoes sterilization. ESBO is also used in PVC cling films for wrapping foods and toys. Safety =Food = A Swiss survey in June 2005 showed that (among many other plasticizers exceeding the legal limits) migration of ESBO into foods reached up to 1,170 mg/kg. Rapid Alert System in Food and Feed (RASFF) had also reported cases of food product rejection in EU for exceeding SML under EU Legislation (EC/2002/72).EC.europa.eu RAPID ALERT SYSTEM FOR FOOD AND FEED Enforcement authorities took measures to force producers respecting the legal limits. =Legislation= In Europe, plastics in food contact are regulated by Regulation (EU) 10/2011. It establishes a specific migration limit (SML) for ESBO of 60 mg/kg. However, in the case of PVC gaskets used to seal glass jars containing infant formulae and follow-on formulae as defined by Directive 2006/141/EC or processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children as defined by Directive 2006/125/EC, the SML is lowered to 30 mg/kg. This is because babies have higher food consumption per body weight. =Toxicity= The tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ESBO defined by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) of the EU is 1 mg/kg body weight. This value is based on a toxicological assessment performed by the British Industrial Biological Research Association (BIBRA) in the late 1997.

Early life John Richardson was born in 1667, probably in the village of North Cave, East Riding of Yorkshire, where his father, William Richardson (1614‚Äì1679), a shepherd, had been converted to Quakerism by William Dewsberry or Dewsbury in about 1652.East Riding Quakers: Retrieved 29 September 2010. He was twelve when his father died, leaving his mother with a livestock farm to run and five children.

Richardson became a weaver's apprentice, and then took to clock and watch mending from a shop in Bridlington. He began preaching regularly, despite a stammer, and made a preaching tour of the Midlands, during which he met William Dewsberry in Warwick. Four more tours of England and Wales followed in 1687‚Äì95. In about 1695, he moved to Quaker Cottage in Hutton Le Hole - a datestone in the house has his initials - and married Priscilla Canaby (c. 1672 ‚Äì c. 1700), a baker's daughter, who also began preaching about 1698.Life, 4th e., p. 47. Further tours of Southern England and of Scotland followed. He was left with three children under the age of five when his wife died, but the youngest also died less than a year later. American tour Leaving his two surviving children with foster parents, Richardson set out for America as an evangelist, arriving in Maryland in 1701 after a 16-week crossing. He spent more than two years there, ceaselessly touring and disputing with Quakers and non-Quakers, on one occasion accompanying William Penn to treat with some American Indians, who made a favourable impression on him.Life, 4th e., pp. 137‚Äì42.

Richardson wrote a poignant memorial to her as an exemplary wife and Quaker.Life, 4th e., pp. 191‚Äì201. The urge to travel and preach continued with Richardson for the rest of his life. He toured Ireland in 1717 and had criticisms to make of the local Quakers on grounds of slackness.

It is the oldest systematically designed and built structure in Namibia, pre-dating all buildings erected by Europeans. Built at the end of the 18th century, most likely between 1796 and 1798 by Klaas Afrikaner and his two sons Jager and Titus, «ÅKhauxa«Énas served as a hidden retreat and a fortress to fend off possible pursuits by Cape authorities. The Orlam Afrikaner tribe left the place in the 1820s but it continued to be inhabited by the Veldschoendragers («ÅHawoben) tribe until the mid-19th century. Location and site description «ÅKhauxa«Énas is situated in the eastern part of the «ÅKaras Region in southern Namibia, south-east of Keetmanshoop. It lies on the banks of Bak River, off the district road D612. The nearest inhabited settlement is Warmfontein, to the north-west. The site can only be reached by four-wheel drive vehicles, and the last kilometer has to be reached on foot. The site named «ÅKhauxa«Énas refers to the fortified settlement atop the hill overlooking the Bak River. It consists of a trapezium-shaped walled-in enclosure of approximately 150 by 350 meters, and contains several ruins of buildings and kraals. Most of the dwellings are situated near the perimeter wall, which contains 23 doorways. The settlement directly adjacent to the west is the Veldschoendragers Schans Vlakte village that was described by 19th century missionaries. It is equally uninhabited today and contains the ruins of a church that was designed to accommodate 300 people. While the fortification was built by piling sandstone slabs and fitting them together, for the church walls mortar was used. The military use and value of the fortress can be disputed. The length of the perimeter wall and the amount of doorways in it would have made the site difficult to defend against a sizable number of attackers. The dwellings would have been particularly at risk as they were placed very close to the surrounding wall. However, «ÅKhauxa«Énas might never have had to prove its defensive properties. Ridsdale reports that > \\"[t]he opportunity of defending themselves in their impregnable > fortification[...] never occurred, as the commandoes of Boers from the > Colony pursued them no farther than Nisbett Bath\\", where \\"Nisbett Bath\\" is a reference to Warmbad, and Boers are the white South African descendants of German and Prussian immigrants whose transit was via the Dutch ports to the Cape. History =Foundation as Afrikaner hideout= In the 1770s the Orlam Afrikaner clan under the leadership of Klaas Afrikaner left the Cape Colony, first with the consent, possibly even under the order, of the Dutch East India Company. The clan subsequently got into conflict with the authorities which openly broke out in March 1796 when the Afrikaners shot a farmer, Pieter Pienaar. It was in this year or soon thereafter that «ÅKhauxa«Énas was built by Klaas Afrikaner and his two sons Jager and Titus. «ÅKhauxa«Énas served as a hidden retreat and a fortress to fend off possible pursuits by the Cape authorities. The Orlam Afrikaners inhabited it until the 1820s when they moved further northwards to Blydeverwacht and eventually to Windhoek. =Veldschoendragers village and missionary outpost= After the departure of the Afrikaner clan the Veldschoendragers («ÅHawoben) moved from Klipfontein to «ÅKhauxa«Énas, which they called Schans Vlakte. It became the capital village of their tribe and was the place of their chief's residence. Several Wesleyan missionaries stationed in Warmbad visited the village that by then had lost its military importance. Due to a severe draught at the end of the 1840s, the «ÅHawoben were forced to move further northwards. When the Rhenish Missionary Society took over operations in Warmbad in 1867 they did not make any reference to «ÅKhauxa«Énas and its population. =During the Herero and Namaqua War= Jacob Morenga and his men used «ÅKhauxa«Énas as a refuge during the Herero and Namaqua uprising 1904‚Äì07. From there they launched a series of attacks against German Schutztruppe which culminated in the killing of Lieutenant Baron Nikolai von Stempel on 30 August 1904. Discovery The only historical written description of «ÅKhauxa«Énas is found in the diaries of Benjamin Ridsdale and John A. Bailie from the Wesleyan Missionary Society who were missionaries in Warmbad in the 1840s. Ridsdale writes: > \\"In front of the village is a low mountain, which is surrounded at the top > by a wall, the entire length of which must be eight or ten hundred yards, > low in places difficult to access, and five or six feet high in those parts > that are most easily available. This wall, which consists of a double row of > loose flat stones piled one above another, was thrown round the mountain by > the Afrikaners (Orlam Afrikaners from Nama descent) at the beginning of the > century.\\" After their visit the place was only rediscovered in 1986 by Klaus Dierks, hobby historian and later deputy minister in the Namibian Government. None of the written historical records of the Orlam Afrikaners mention the place. Importance and recognition The ruins of «ÅKhauxa«Énas are the earliest engineered settlement in Namibia known . All its buildings are older than any of the structures erected by Europeans, including the Schmelenhaus in Bethanie (built 1814) and the mission station in Warmbad (built between 1805 and 1810). Both were at some time considered to be the oldest buildings in Namibia‚Äîit now turns out that this recognition ignored the history of the indigenous population. Existence of this settlement provides strong evidence that a developed society existed prior to German colonisation. The discoverer Dr. Dierks compared its possible impact on nation building and national pride to that of the Great Zimbabwe ruins. He points out that > \\"[m]ost of the written records [on the history of Namibia] were compiled by > European adventurers, travellers, missionaries and colonial administrators; > inevitably the Namibian people are described primarily from an alien > perspective [...].\\" It was for many years assumed that cultural and social development in the area began only with the intrusion of European influences. Structures of unknown origin had previously been attributed to European builders in the pre-colonial and colonial era; «ÅKhauxa«Énas itself was entered on maps as \\"Old German Fortifications 1904-1906\\", which was later proven false, given that it was used as shelter and hideout against the Schutztruppe (Protection Force) of the German Empire. The ruins of «ÅKhauxa«Énas were proclaimed a National Monument in 1992. This proclamation has not been effected. In 1997 the Government of Namibia issued a series of stamps featuring the ruins.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in the grounds of the demolished Blatherwycke Hall. History The church dates from the 11th century, and alterations and additions were made to it during the following three centuries. The tower was rebuilt in the early 17th century. The chancel was rebuilt in 1819 and later in the century the north aisle and north chapel were also rebuilt. The church was declared redundant on 1 November 1976, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 25 April 1978. Architecture =Exterior= Holy Trinity is constructed in limestone with Collyweston stone slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a north aisle and a south porch, and a chancel with a north chapel, and a west tower.

Before that, in his capacity as chairman of KWI (Bishops' Conference of Indonesia) - and in connection with the anniversary of Indonesian independence in 1999 - he wrote a harsh statement condemning the leaders of countries that fail to serve the interests of the people, and called for an end widespread corruption within the government.

These urban legends are characterized by originating in or being popularized throughout the country of Japan. These urban legends commonly involve paranormal entities or creatures who encounter and/or attack humans, but the term can also encompass widespread, non-supernatural rumors in popular culture. Urban legends in the former category rarely include the folklore y≈çkai, instead being primarily based on contemporary examples of y≈´rei (Japanese ghosts). Modern Japanese urban legends tend to take place in schools or urban settings, and some can be considered cautionary tales. Natural legends =1932 Shirokiya Department Store deaths= The 1932 Shirokiya Department Store fire On 16 December 1932, the Shirokiya Department Store fire in Tokyo resulted in 14 deaths. During the fire, many saleswomen in kimono were forced onto the roof of the eight-story building. Rumors later spread that some of these women refused to jump into the safety nets held by firefighters on the ground. Traditionally, women did not wear undergarments with kimono, and they were afraid they would be exposed and ashamed if they jumped. As a result, they died. This news attracted attention from as far away as Europe. It has been alleged that in the aftermath of the fire, department store management ordered saleswomen to wear panties or other underwear with their kimono, and the trend spread. Contrary to this belief, Shoichi Inoue, a professor of Japanese customs and architecture at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, has denied the story of the ambivalent women with fatal modesty. According to Inoue, most people were saved by firemen, and the story of women who preferred to die with their modesty intact was fabricated for Westerners. The story has been prevalent in many reference books, even some published by the Fire Fighting Agency. Moreover, it is generally believed in Japan that the Shirokiya Department Store fire was a catalyst for the change in fashion customs, specifically the trend toward wearing Western-style panties, though there is no evidence to substantiate the belief. =Sony timer= It was rumored that the Sony Corporation installed a device in all of its electronic products that caused them to fail soon after their warranties expired, an illegal form of planned obsolescence. This has never been substantiated and while it is unlikely that Sony would explicitly add expiration devices to their hardware, the \\"Sony Timer\\" has also been taken to mean that Sony manufactures devices to withstand just enough use to necessitate a new line. At the annual shareholders meeting in 2007, then president Ryoji Chubachi said that he was aware of the term \\"Sony Timer\\".„ÇΩ„Éã„Éº„ÄÅÂÆöÊôÇÊ†™‰∏ªÁ∑è‰ºö„ÇíÈñãÂÇ¨„ÄÇ„ÄåÂà©Áõä„Çí‰º¥„ÅÜÊàêÈï∑„Å∏„Äç „Äå„ÇΩ„Éã„Éº„Çø„Ç§„Éû„Éº„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜË®ÄËëâ„ÅØË™çË≠ò„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Äç‰∏≠Èâ¢Á§æÈï∑ (in Japanese), 2007-06-21, AV watch Supernatural legends =Aka Manto (\\"Red Cape\\")= is described as a male spirit who wears a red cloak and a mask which hides his face, and is said to haunt public or school bathrooms, and often specifically the last stall of female bathrooms. According to legend, individuals using a toilet in such bathrooms may be asked by Aka Manto to choose between red paper or blue paper (in some versions, the options will be red or blue cloaks or capes, rather than paper). Choosing the \\"red\\" option results in fatal lacerations or flaying, while choosing the \\"blue\\" option results in strangulation or all of the individual's blood being drained from their body. Picking a color which has not been offered leads to the individual being dragged to an underworld or hell, and in some accounts, choosing \\"yellow\\" results in the person's head being pushed into the toilet. Ignoring the spirit, rejecting both options offered by the spirit, escaping the bathroom, or a combination of the aforementioned methods are said to result in the individual's survival. =Cursed Kleenex commercial= In the 1980s, Kleenex released three Japanese commercials for their tissues, featuring a woman played by actress Keiko Matsuzaka dressed in a white dress and a child dressed as a Japanese ogre, sitting on straw. Each advert had the song \\"It's a Fine Day\\" by Edward Barton and Jane playing in the background. Allegedly, viewers began to file complaints with television stations and with Kleenex's corporate headquarters because they found the commercial unnerving, and some supposedly claimed that the song sounded like a German curse, despite the lyrics being in English. False rumors about the cast and crew are purported to have circulated, including that all those involved in filming the commercial met untimely deaths in accidents, that Matsuzaka was institutionalized after a mental breakdown, or that Matsuzaka became pregnant with a demon child. The demon child was actually supposed to be the character Ten from the anime Urusei Yatsura. =Curse of the Colonel= The is supposedly suffered by the Hanshin Tigers baseball team and cited as the cause of their poor performance in the Japan Championship Series. In 1985, fans of the Hanshin Tigers celebrated their team's first and only victory of the series and, in their excitement, threw a statue of Colonel Sanders (the founder and mascot of KFC) into the D≈çtonbori River. For several years after the incident, the team failed to win the Championship again, and some fans believed the team would never do so again until the statue was recovered. The statue was finally discovered in the D≈çtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought it was a large barrel and, shortly after, a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the upper portion of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found the next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. The legend is similar in nature to the Curse of the Bambino. =Gozu (\\"Cow Head\\")= , also known as \\"Ox Head\\", is a Japanese urban legend about a fictional story called \\"Cow Head\\". Supposedly the \\"Cow Head\\" story is so horrifying that people who read or hear it are overcome with fear so great that they tremble violently for days on end until they die. One variation involves a teacher who tells a fragment of the story to his class while on a school trip, resulting in the children becoming paralysed by fear and losing their memory after the bus crashed while the teacher was reading. Other variations include the detail that no one is able to retell the story since they die after hearing it. Rumors say that only fragments are left of the story. One such fragment is about a town that got cursed after they ate the Cow Head. The \\"Cow Head\\" story was rumored to be an unpublished piece from sci-fi writer Sakyo Komatsu, but there is no evidence to link the author to the legend. A Ukrainian folktale called Cow's Head exists, about a woman who receives good fortune by offering food and shelter to a disembodied cow's head that visits her one night, A Gion Matsuri folktale called Somin Shorai exists, about a poor but charitable person who receives good fortune by saving a tourist Gozu Tenn≈ç (ÁâõÈ†≠Â§©Áéã) who was looking for a place to stay the night on his journey, as well as a 2003 film called Gozu, directed by Takashi Miike, neither of which are linked to the legend. =Hanako-san of the Toilet (Toire no Hanako-san)= Hanako-san, or , is a legend about the spirit of a young girl named Hanako who haunts school bathrooms. Different versions of the story include that Hanako-san is the ghost of a girl who was killed while playing hide-and-seek during an air raid in World War II, that she was murdered by stranger or an abusive parent, or that she committed suicide in a school bathroom. Rumors and legends about Hanako-san have achieved notable popularity in Japanese primary schools, where children may challenge classmates to try and summon Hanako-san. =Inokashira Park curse= In Inokashira Park, Tokyo, there is a shrine to the goddess Benzaiten, as well as Inokashira Pond, a lake where visitors can rent rowing boats. There is an urban legend which states that if a couple rides on a boat together, their relationship will end prematurely. In some versions of the legend, happy couples who visit the park will be cursed by the jealous Benzaiten, which will cause them to break up. =Jinmenken (\\"Human-Faced Dog\\")= are dogs with human faces that are said to appear at night in Japanese urban areas. They are rumored to be able to run along highways at extremely high speeds, which allows them to overtake cars and then look back at drivers with their human faces. Jinmenken can talk, but prefer to be left alone. In some stories, which are often presented as comedic, wherein individuals may encounter a dog rummaging through garbage, only for the dog to look up, revealing itself as a jinmenken with its human face, and say something like \\"leave me alone!\\" (or \\"hottoite kure!\\"). Explanations for jinmenken include that they are genetic experiments, or that a jinmenken is the ghost of a human who was struck by a car while walking a dog. The concept of dogs with human faces dates back to at least as early as 1810, when a \\"human-faced puppy\\" was reportedly exhibited at a misemono. Rumors about jinmenken may also have circulated among surfers in the 1950s, but the modern concept of the legend is first known to have spread across Japan in 1989. Additionally, jinmenken, or human-faced dogs, have made appearances in various media. A dog with a human face appears in the 1978 American film Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and jinmenken have been featured in the anime and video game franchise Yo-kai Watch. =Kokkuri= or is a Japanese game which became popular during the Meiji era. The game is similar to the use of a Ouija board, though rather than using a store-bought board with letters and a planchette, players write down hiragana characters and place their fingers on a coin, before asking \\"Kokkuri-san\\" a question. This is a popular game in Japanese high schools. Legends about the game include Kokkuri-san only telling players the date of their death, while others say that one can ask Kokkuri-san anything, but one must finish the game either by saying goodbye to Kokkuri-san before leaving the table or by disposing of the kokkuri game utensils within a certain time limit, such as spending the coin or using up the ink in the pen used to write the hiragana. Failure to do so will result in misfortune or death for the players. =Kuchisake-onna (\\"Slit- Mouthed Woman\\")= is an urban legend about the malevolent spirit, or onry≈ç, of a woman with a mutilated mouth. She is said to partially cover her face with a mask or object, and reportedly carries a sharp tool of some kind, such as a knife or a large pair of scissors. According to popular legend, she will ask potential victims if they think she is attractive. If an individual responds with \\"no\\", she will kill them with her weapon. If they say \\"yes\\", she will then reveal that the corners of her mouth have been slit from ear to ear. If the individual again responds that she is unattractive, or if they scream in fright, she will kill them with her weapon. If they say \\"yes\\", she will cut the corners of their mouth in such a way that mimics her own disfigurement. To survive an encounter with Kuchisake-onna, it is said that individuals may answer her question by describing her appearance as \\"average\\", or distract her with money or hard candies. =Kunekune (\\"Wriggling body\\")= is an urban legend which concerns distant apparitions seen on widely extended rice or barley fields on hot summer days. A kunekune refers to an indiscernible white object, similar in appearance to a tall, slender strip of paper or a textile sheet, that shimmers and wiggles as if moved by wind, even on windless days. According to legend, anyone who tries to get a closer look at it is driven insane or dies when touching it. Early reports of kunekune appeared on several websites at the same time. The kunekune legend may be based on local ghost stories about scarecrows coming to life at night (or when someones stares at them too often). Alleged encounters of kunekune are likely a misinterpretation of either a scarecrow wiggling slightly in the wind or wick drains planted to drain water from inner ground to robust the soft ground. =Teke Teke (or Kashima Reiko)= is the ghost of a young woman or schoolgirl who fell on a railway line, which resulted in her body being cut in half by a train. She is an onry≈ç, or a vengeful spirit, who lurks around urban areas and train stations at night. Since she no longer has lower extremities, she travels on either her hands or elbows, dragging her upper torso and making a scratching or \\"teke teke\\"-like sound. If she encounters a potential victim, she will chase them and slice them in half at the torso with a scythe or other weapon. In some versions of the Teke Teke story, the spirit is identified as Kashima Reiko, who is said to have died when her legs were severed from her body by a train. According to legend, her legless ghost haunts bathrooms, asking occupants if they know where her legs are. If a questioned individual replies with an answer that Kashima deems unacceptable, she will tear or cut their legs off. Individuals may escape Kashima by replying that her legs are on the Meishin Expressway, or by answering her question with the phrase \\"kamen shinin ma\\", which translates to \\"mask death demon\\".

In 1969‚Äì70, a full excavation of the site under the guidance of Ze'ev Yeivin revealed that the building occupied the most prominent site in the village. Ancillary buildings attached to the synagogue were removed in order to reveal the old structure. The old synagogue was built in \\"broadhouse\\" style without columns and measured by . Entry was by any of three doors along its eastern side and one of the three niches recessed into the northern wall functioned as the Torah Ark. The building housed a mosaic floor and displayed external ornamental carvings. Four seven-branched menorahs were discovered carved onto door lintels and one of them is displayed in Jerusalem's Rockefeller Museum. Along the northern and southern walls of the synagogue were built two benches, one on top of the other, of which only remnants remain. After the Muslim conquest, the synagogue was converted into a mosque and a mihrab was added. The mihrab was built in place of the bench that ran along its southern wall. According to a local tradition, this addition was made during the conquest of Salah a-Din, rather than during the early Muslim conquest of the Levant.

The ferry port was earlier on Drelnes, which is a few hundred metres further east of Krambatangi. But in 2005 a new ferry arrived, which was much bigger than the prior one, and therefore required a new ferryport at Krambatangi. Krambatangi does not belong to the municipality of Tv√∏royri, and there have been some disagreements between the Tv√∏royri municipality and Strandfaraskip Landsins (SSL) because they didn't pay harbour dues for entering the port of Tv√∏royri.

He was named a 2010 MacArthur Fellow. Early life Nick Benson began working in his family business, The John Stevens Shop at age fifteen for his father, John Everett Benson. Nick is a third generation stone carver and letterer. He studied Drawing and Design at State University of New York at Purchase in 1986. Benson spent 1987 at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung Basel in Basel, Switzerland where he studied calligraphy, type design, typography, and drawing under Andre Gurtler, Christian Mengelt and Armin Hofmann. He returned to the U.S. in 1988 and continued to work under John Benson in The John Stevens Shop. His father passed on the business to him in 1993.Anne Harding, 'Carving His Niche' Boston Globe, 1996 Benson expands the traditional arts of hand lettering and stone carving through his designs. He is also committed to teaching young artisans, in the hopes that they will go on to create their own works and thereby ensure that the legacy of this centuries- old artistic practice endures. He has had several design students, especially from nearby Rhode Island School of Design, and apprentices work with him in the shop and on projects. His uncle was the American photographer Richard Benson. Richard Benson was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1986, making the Bensons one of two families with multiple MacArthur fellows. Work Benson has created a distinctive architectural lettering for these architectural and monumental commissions, with careful attention to the effects that large scale, shifting light, and long-term weathering have on the letters, as well as carefully crafting very small details of each letter. \\"The entire composition is key,\\" he explained in an interview with the architectural historian Judith Dupr√©, \\"but the proportion of the letter, the design of the particular letter form itself, is extremely important too. Equally important is the cadence of the text, how the negative space is used, word spacing, line spacing‚Äîall of that is absolutely crucial to good inscriptional carving.\\" Judith Dupr√©, \\"Interview with Nicholas Benson,\\" Monuments: America's History in Art and Memory (New York: Random House, 2007): 141. He developed an original font that draws on both classical Greek letter forms and contemporary sans serif lettering for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, on the National Mall. Benson's work at The John Stevens Shop has also included personal gravestones and tomb markers. Benson's father, grandfather and his predecessors at the Shop have created individual gravestones on materials including grey slate and Rhode Island granite. His carvings can be found in the National Gallery of Art, the Yale University Art Gallery, at Brown University, and in Washington D.C., the National World War II Memorial and the Dwight D.

It is the only non-governmental organization in the Russian Federation, devoted to the study of the life of Soviet Jews during the Great Patriotic War.  Responsibilities and activities  The main tasks of the Center comprise historical research, conducting memorial services, the incorporation of the Holocaust topic into the curricula of secondary schools and universities, promoting the formation of opinions as well as interviews with contemporary witnesses. The Center, furthermore, organizes regular exhibitions. The Holocaust Center addressed itself to inform the Russian public about the genocide of Jews. The foundation of this goal is the specialist library, where a large number of publications relating to the Holocaust in the former USSR are available. Besides, the library includes a video collection and an archive for the preservation of the personal belongings of former ghetto prisoners, participants in the Great Patriotic War and members of the Resistance. It also offers its own seminar room with a permanent documentary exhibition. Furthermore, temporary exhibitions are also held from time to time. The most important target group for the Centers educational programs are teachers. New projects are constantly being developed and implemented in order to enable teachers to participate in specific courses and pass their newly gained knowledge to their students. This initiative intends to counteract anti-Semitism and to raise awareness for the events of the past through education. Meetings of the discussion group \\"Unknown Holocaust\\", the Youth Center and the Association of the Righteous Among the Nations are held at the Center on a monthly basis. Leading world experts regularly give lectures and hold presentations such as Professor Michael Berenbaum, one of the founders of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the former director of the Yad Vashem Museum Izhak Arad, Paul Levin and Stephane Bruhfeld (Sweden), the authors of the book Tell Your Children About It, and Shimon Samuels, director of the European Bureau of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Every year, the Center organizes evening ceremonies commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and the heroes of the Resistance. Government leaders also participate in these events, which evokes a strong response from the society and the media. The Holocaust Center's activities  Direction  The Center is under the direction of Alla Gerber, a writer and journalist and former member of the State Duma, who is currently president of the foundation and co-chairman of the center, and co-chairman Ilya Altman, who is a well-known historian and archivist. Henri Reznik, a famous Russian lawyer, is chairman of the board, which includes other personalities form the fields of economy, science, culture and politics.  International cooperations  The network of foreign partners constitutes a key element for the work of the Holocaust Center, especially as a research and educational institution. The Center works in close cooperation with several foreign organizations: Apart from an intensive collaboration with Yad Vashem, which allowed the realization of several seminars and educational programs, the Center cooperates with the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Hereby the publication of the book \\"Antisemitism: The Generic Hatred\\" was realized. Additionally, the Center has close ties with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington D.C., where Russian teachers annually take part in educational seminars. Other important partners are the Anne Frank Foundation and the University of Gothenburg (Sweden). Moreover, the Center participates in important international conferences such as the Stockholm Forum. Many of its partner institutions are based in German speaking countries, such as the House of the Wannsee Conference, where seminars with Russian and Belarusian teachers regularly take place. Another achievement is the book \\"Victims of Hate\\" by Ilya Altman which is the result of the successful cooperation with Hamburg Institute for Social Sciences. Apart from the close ties with different museums, such as the Jewish Museum Berlin, the German-Russian Museum Berlin- Karlshorst and the Jewish Museum Frankfurt (where seminars for teachers are regularly conducted), the Holocaust Center cooperates with the Ruprecht-Karls- University Heidelberg. For many years the Center has successfully been working together with Germany-based Action Reconciliation Service for Peace. Within the framework of this cooperation, every year one young volunteer from ARSP works in the Center in Moscow. Since the late nineties, also young Austrians fulfill their compulsory paid community service in the Center. This was, at first, a cooperation with \\"Verein GEDENKDIENST\\", but since 2010, the cooperation only involves volunteers of the Austrian Service Abroad. All three organizations pursue the goal of preserving the memory of the victims of National socialism also among the younger generations. Moreover, the Holocaust Center is supported by numerous German, English, Israeli and other international foundations.

(\\"Here, there...\\" in French) is an independent record label based in Nancy, France and established by St√©phane Gr√©goire in 1997 from his associative label \\"Sine Terra Firma\\". It is mainly involved with production, publishing, booking and pressing. History Sine Terra Firma released both first albums of Yann Tiersen, La Valse des monstres (1995) and Rue des Cascades (1996) and began to be successful. The last compilation of the associative label, called Ici, d'ailleurs... (1996), gave its name to the indie record label. Ici, d'ailleurs... keeps an eclectic artistic direction, with no particularly musical genre. The release of the third Yann Tiersen album, Le Phare (1998) allowed the label to expand internationally by proposing at once French and foreign artists, not recognized or on the way to the being. In 2002, the label created 0101, the electronic division of the label. Two years later, Ici, d'ailleurs... created a new collection named OuMuPo, an acronym for Ouvroir de MUsique POtentiel (workshop for potential music) in reference to the OuLiPo, OUvroir de LItt√©rature POtentiel (workshop for potential literature). The principle is making art under constraint. Several DJ's and electronic music composers have been offered to remix the whole label catalog. But there is a twist. They have to comply with constraints issued in the Ici, d'ailleurs... Charter. A huge fan of the OuBaPo, OUvroir de BAnde-Dessin√©e POtentiel (workshop for potential comics), Ici d'ailleurs... asked Jean-Christophe Menu, founder member of L'Association, an independent publishing society, to be in charge of the graphic side of the project. For each new work, the OuBaPiens, French cartoonists collective, created a sixteen pages comic book which comes along on top of each OuMuPo album, each time drawn by a different person. Again, these comics are ruled by a Charter to spice up the game. The collection includes six albums. At the end of 2004, St√©phane Gr√©goire wanted to both re-interpret and pay tribute to Coil's music.http://www.thedarkageoflove.com/ The project This Immortal Coil was built step by step during five years with Ya√´l Naim, Bonnie Prince Billy, Yann Tiersen, Matt Elliott, DAAU, Chapelier Fou, Sylvain Chauveau, Christine Ott, Oktopus, Nightwood, David Donatien and Nicolas Jorio.

Trophos was founded in 1999 in Marseille by three scientists: Christopher Henderson, Olivier Pourquie and Jean-Louis Kraus, and two entrepreneurs: Antoine Beret and Michel Delaage. Trophos' lead compound was olesoxime (TRO19622). Olesoxime is a mitochondrial targeted compound, which is a member of a new class of therapeutic agents aimed at bringing significant therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from devastating neurological diseases. Results from an international, double- blind, placebo-controlled phase II study involving 165 type II and non- ambulatory type III patients with spinal muscular atrophy, completed in February 2014 to assess safety and efficacy of olesoxime (TRO19622) showed that patients treated with olesoxime were able to maintain motor function over the two-year period of the study and that typical health complications associated with SMA occurred less frequently than in patients treated with a placebo, leading to better well being. In January 2015, Hoffmann-La Roche announced its intention to buy Trophos for upfront and up to in milestone performance payments. The deal was completed shortly afterwards.

It is situated on the District Road 1972, 25 km south-east of Okahandja in the Otjozondjupa Region. Its close proximity to the capital Windhoek makes it a popular weekend destination for locals. History Originally known as Otjikango (Otjiherero: \\"large fountain\\"), the site was inhabited by the Herero people. When Wesleyan missionaries arrived in Windhoek in 1844 at the invitation of Jonker Afrikaner, Rhenish missionaries Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt, already resident there since 1842, feared conflict and moved on to Otjikango. Here they established the first Rhenish mission station to the Herero in late 1844. They named the place Barmen after the town Barmen (today part of Wuppertal) in Germany where the headquarters of the Rhenish Missionary Society were located. The ruins of the missionary house are still visible. At that time the road network in South West Africa was being developed under the supervision, and at the initiative, of Jonker Afrikaner. Hahn and Kleinschmidt initiated the creation of a path from Windhoek to Barmen via Okahandja, and in 1850 this road, later known as Alter Baiweg (Old Bay Path), was extended via Otjimbingwe to Walvis Bay. This route developed into an important trade connection between the coast and Windhoek and was in use until 1900, when the railway line from Swakopmund was commissioned. Hahn taught Western farming techniques and tried to settle the Herero in Otjikango, but the Herero left the area to escape the recurrent attacks of Jonker Afrikaner's Nama in 1850, especially following his victory at Okahandja in August 1950. Hahn was ordered to report back to Germany, but he was reassigned to Kaapstad in November 1852. Since the Wesleyan missionaries had abandoned Windhoek to Jonker's raids, Hahn was hired to take their place but failed to secure it and arrived back in Barmen on September 13, 1853. In early 1856, he returned, but this time he settled in Otjimbingwe where the Herero had taken refuge. The next Rhenish Missionary to settle in Gross Barmen was the Rev. Peter Heinrich Brincker. He married on February 10, 1864, and shortly after resumed the ministry at the station. He had to flee for his life from Nama attacks on the station no less than seven times, only to resettle it again. When the residents of the station finally fled in 1866, Brincker returned to Otjimbingwe, but a few months later he went back to Gross Barmen because the Eastern Herero, or Mbandjeru, had unexpectedly settled there. He had some success evangelizing to them, but was stymied when they left to join chief Maharero in Okahandja. Returning to Otjimbingwe once more, Brincker would be back in Gross Barmen in 1869, when the war was almost over. He set about immediately rebuilding the station, this time with a school and church. In the years following the so-called Peace of Okahandja (September 13, 1870), which the missionaries fostered for a decade, boasted 251 residents and 130 children attending the school. After a visit back to Germany in February 1880, Brincker returned to German South West Africa, but this time went instead to Otjimbingwe. The mission station was operational until the start of Herero War in 1904, but was destroyed by Herero insurgents. The settlement also had a police station at that time, and a military fort which was demolished during the uprising. The village was destroyed by burning by German colonial troops under the command of Leutnant Eugen Mansfeld on 17 February 1904. Hot springs The recreational centre at Gross Barmen was built in 1977. The water of the hot spring comes from a depth of 2,500 m. It exits the ground at 65 ¬∞C and is cooled down to around 40 ¬∞C for the thermal bath. Gross Barmen is managed by Namibia Wildlife Resorts (NWR), the company responsible for all national parks and official recreational areas in Namibia. Besides the thermal bath it featured a petrol station, a restaurant, and overnight accommodation until 2010 but became the biggest loss maker of NWR. It is now in a period of reconstruction and expansion and was scheduled to be reopened in 2013.

Despite being sent to Texas to collaborate with Manuel de Sandoval in the administration of that province, he instead filed criminal charges against Sandoval and sent him to prison. He then reduced the number of guards watching the missions from three to one per mission. Ultimately, his economic mismanagement of Texas led the province to near bankruptcy. He implemented the first \\"dula\\" for the distribution of river waters and granted lands to retired soldiers and military widows. He was arrested and accused of arrogant behavior. After he stepped down as governor in September 1737, he was found not guilty in his trial and became an officer of the garrison of Veracruz, Mexico.  Biography  = Early years = Franquis was born in La Orotava, Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) in 1691. When he was young, he moved to Havana, Cuba, where he married √Ångela de Alarc√≥n y Oca√±a. In 1736, Philip V appointed him governor of the province of Tlaxcala, Mexico. However, when Franquis arrived in Mexico, he learned that the office of governor of Tlaxcala was not yet vacant, as it was still being held by his predecessor. Because Franquis could not take office, the Viceroy, Archbishop Vizarr√≥n, appointed him governor ad interim of Texas to collaborate with Manuel de Sandoval to improve the administration in that province. On September 26, 1736, Franquis came to San Antonio. He refused to show his Spanish credentials. From the beginning, he rejected the civil and religious authorities in the area. In 1737, Franquis deposed Sandoval of his charge, filing criminal charges against him. Accused of seven counts of official misconduct, Sandoval was later sent to Prison. In doing so, Franquis replaced Sandoval in the government of Texas. = Governor of Texas = Upon taking office, Franquis' economic mismanagement led the province to near bankruptcy, and he became the enemy of almost every missionary and presidio official between Saltillo and Texas.Weddle, Robert S. (1998). San Juan Bautista: Gateway to Spanish Texas. Page 211. Franquis ordered the friars to reduce the number of guards established in each the mission, from three to one, even though the soldiers were very important to the missions because they contributed to the maintenance of \\"discipline\\" and the \\"daily tasks\\" of \\"returning the runaways\\". On April 1737, the governor removed all of the mission guards. On June 8, 1737, San Francisco mission was abandoned and the 230 Native Americans who worked there recovered their freedom, while the other religious establishments had lost many Native American workers (including at the San Juan Capristano mission, where most of the workers abandoned the mission). Although the Viceroy ordered Franquis to restore the mission guards, he decided to ignore the order.Chipman, Donald E.; Joseph, Harriett Denise (2010). Spanish Texas, 1519‚Äì1821: Revised Edition. Pages 143-144. The University of Texas Press. However, accusations were issued against him because he had taken the Native Americans from the missions to places located outside of their lands, so they fled to the woods and informed the unconverted Native Americans (the Native Americans workers of the missions had been convert to Christianity) about their violent treatment by the governors.Reed Swanton, John (1942). Source Material on the History and Ethnology of the Caddo Indians. Page 67. University of Oklahoma Press. Shortly after he arrived in San Antonio, he conceded three lots of land to widows of military members and another two to military veterans.De la Teja, Jes√∫s F. (1995). San Antonio de B√©xar: A Community on New Spain's Northern Frontier. Page 35. University of New Mexico Press. For instance, he implemented the first \\"dula\\" (a piece of land that receives irrigation from a ditch) for the distribution of rivers. This suggests his involvement in the institutionalization of the distribution of water during the early years of colonization.Bienmesabe. Presencia canaria en el sur de Estados Unidos (In Spanish: Bienmesabe. Canarian presence in South of United States). Accessed September 29, 2010 at 15:00. Shortly thereafter, an investigation of Franquis's administration took place, which ended on July 9, 1737. = Last years = After the investigation, Franquis was arrested and accused of arrogant behavior. In September 1737, he stepped down as governor and retired to San Juan Bautista, California, where he defected and settled in Mexico City. Franquis was found not guilty in his trial. A little later, he settled in Veracruz, Mexico, and became an officer of the garrison of that city. Finally, he returned to the regiment of Savoy in Spain. The place and date of his death are not known, but it is thought that he died in Mexico or Spain.

Designed by various volunteer developers at linuxcnc.org, it is typically bundled as an ISO file with a modified version of 32-bit Ubuntu Linux which provides the required real-time kernel. Due to the tight real-time operating system integration, a standard Ubuntu Linux desktop PC without the real-time kernel will only run the package in demo mode. Purpose LinuxCNC is a software system for numerical control of machines such as milling machines, lathes, plasma cutters, routers, cutting machines, robots and hexapods. It can control up to 9 axes or joints of a CNC machine using G-code (RS-274NGC) as input. It has several GUIs suited to specific kinds of usage (touch screen, interactive development). Currently it is almost exclusively used on x86 PC platforms, but has been ported to other architectures. It makes extensive use of a real time- modified kernel, and supports both stepper- and servo-type drives. It does not provide drawing (CAD - Computer Aided Design) or G-code generation from the drawing (CAM - Computer Automated Manufacturing) functions. History The EMC Public Domain software system was originally developed by NIST, as the next step beyond the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences / Air Force sponsored Next Generation Controller Program[NGC 1989] /Specification for an Open Systems Architecture[SOSAS]. It was called the EMC [Enhanced Machine Controller Architecture 1993]. Government sponsored Public Domain software systems for the control of milling machines were among the very first projects developed with the digital computer in the 1950s. It was to be a \\"vendor- neutral\\" reference implementation of the industry standard language for numerical control of machining operations, RS-274D (G-code). The software included the RS274 interpreter driving the motion trajectory planner, real- time motor/actuator drivers and a user interface. It demonstrated the feasibility of an advanced numerical control system using off the shelf PC hardware running FreeBSD or Linux, interfacing to various hardware motion control systems. Additional development continues using current and additional architectures (e.g. ARM architecture devices). The demonstration project was very successful and created a community of users and volunteer contributors. Around June 2000, NIST relocated the source code to SourceForge under the Public Domain license in order to allow external contributors to make changes. In 2003, the community rewrote some parts of it, reorganized and simplified other parts, then gave it the new name, EMC2. EMC2 is still being actively developed. Licensing is now under the GNU General Public License. The adoption of the new name EMC2 was prompted by several major changes. Primarily, a new layer known as HAL (Hardware Abstraction layer) was introduced to interconnect functions easily without altering C code or recompiling. This split trajectory and motion planning from motion hardware, making it easier to generate control programs to support gantry machine, lathe threading and rigid tapping, SCARA robot arms and a variety of other adaptations. HAL comes with some interactive tools to examine signals and connect and remove links. It also includes a virtual oscilloscope to examine signals in real time. Another change with EMC2 is Classic Ladder, (an open-source ladder logic implementation) adapted for the real time environment to configure complex auxiliary devices like automatic tool changers. Around 2011, the name was changed officially from EMC2 to LinuxCNC. This was done at the insistence of EMC Corporation and the agreement of the project leadership. Internally some refer to LinuxCNC by EMC or EMC2 as it was historically known. EMC Corporation proposed that the LinuxCNC project, as previously named, would be confusing for customers or potential customers with their (mainly) storage related products. Platforms Due to the need of fine grained, precise real-time control of machines, LinuxCNC requires a platform with real-time computing capabilities. Early versions of LinuxCNC (EMC) ran under a real-time version of Windows NT, but later version of Windows did not have good real-time support so Linux with real-time extensions became the preferred platform. Currently LinuxCNC uses the RTAI kernel or PREEMPT-RT with LinuxCNC's 'uspace' flavour of the RTAPI. Installing LinuxCNC and the underlying real-time kernel patches on a base Linux system can be a daunting task. Paul Corner came to the rescue with the BDI (Brain Dead Install) which was a CD from which a complete working system (Linux, real-time patches, and LinuxCNC) could be installed. This made LinuxCNC accessible to a much larger user community. Today Paul‚Äôs BDI has evolved into a bootable (live) ISO that can be burned to a CD or USB and run on most any PC style computer to test drive LinuxCNC without having to install the system. Bootable LinuxCNC ISOs are available for Debian wheezy (RTAI kernel) and Debian stretch (RT-PREEMPT kernel). The policy for LinuxCNC is to build packages and offer support for Debian, but pre-built binary packages are also available for other Linux systems and architectures. Design LinuxCNC uses the model of 'sense, plan, act' in its interactions with hardware. For instance, it reads the current axis position, calculates a new target position/voltage, and then writes that to the hardware. There is no buffering of commands nor are externally initiated reads or writes allowed. This no- buffering approach gives the most freedom to adding or changing capabilities of LinuxCNC. By using relatively \\"dumb\\" external hardware and programming the capabilities in the host computer, LinuxCNC is not locked to any one piece of hardware. It also allows an interested user to easily change behaviour/capabilities/hardware. This model tends to lend itself to specific types of external interfaces---PCI, PCIE, Parallel port (in SPP or EPP mode), ISA, and Ethernet have been used for motor control. USB and RS232 serial are not good candidates; USB having bad realtime capabilities and RS232 being too slow for motor control. LinuxCNC has basic \\"realtime\\" requirements because of this model. The interval between reading and writing must be consistent and reasonably fast. A typical machine does realtime calculations in a 1 millisecond repeating thread. The reading and writing to hardware must be a small part of this time, e.g. 200 microseconds, otherwise the phase shift makes tuning more difficult and there is less time available for the non- realtime programs, which may make the screen controls less responsive. LinuxCNC \\"employs a trapezoidal velocity profile generator.\\" Configuration LinuxCNC uses a software layer called HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). HAL allows a multitude of configurations to be built while being flexible: one can mix & match various hardware control boards, output control signals through the parallel port or serial port - while driving stepper or servo motors, solenoids and other actuators. LinuxCNC also includes a software programmable logic controller (PLC) which is usually used in extensive configurations (such as complex machining centres). The software PLC is based on the open source project Classicladder, and runs within the real-time environment.

Life and work Erika Abels d'Albert was the only child of Dr. Ludwig Wilhelm Abels, a Viennese art collector and writer who edited a satirical magazine. Her mother, Anna Emilie Mewes, was from the Berlin area. Abels d'Albert received a private education in Fine Arts in Vienna. In 1911/12 she studied with Irma Duczynska and in 1912/13 with Felix Albrecht Harta.Gabriele Koller and Gloria Withalm, Die Vertreibung des Geistigen aus √ñsterreich: Zur Kulturpolitik des Nationalsozialismus, Zusammenstellung der Ausstellung von der Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Kunst in Wien, J√§nner/Februar 1985, Vienna: Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, 1985, OCLC 467907964, p. 175 She decided early to become a professional artist: at the age of 16 she participated in a group showBiblos 45 (1996) p. 156 (contributing portraits, nudes, still lifes and fashion designs). In subsequent years she participated in exhibitions at various galleries, at the Imperial and Royal Museum of Art and Industry , at the Temple of Theseus in the Volksgarten and at the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus. In 1930 she took part in the exhibition of the Austrian Association of Women Artists. Between 1933 and 1935 she emigrated to Paris. She showed works in 1935 in the Gallery Gregoire Schustermann and in 1938 in the Salon d'Automne. After this her artistic activities are unknown. Erika Abels d'Albert died in Paris in 1975. She painted portraits, still lifes and nudes. There are only three works by her known to be extant in the original. The Vienna Museum owns her oil painting Strassenbahnschaffnerin from 1919, and in the Albertina are a charcoal drawing, Kopf einer Frau in mittleren Jahren (1924), and a chalk drawing, Sitzender R√ºckenakt (1921).Erika Abels d'Albert at artnet.de.

Indigenous people are concentrated in the Southern Amazon rainforest state of Amazonas, where they make up nearly 50% of the population and in the Andes of the western state of Zulia. The most numerous indigenous people, at about 200,000, is the Venezuelan part of the Wayuu (or Guajiro) people who primarily live in Zulia between Lake Maracaibo and the Colombian border.Richard Gott (2005), Hugo Ch√°vez and the Bolivarian Revolution, Verso. p202 Another 100,000 or so indigenous people live in the sparsely populated southeastern states of Amazonas, Bol√≠var and Delta Amacuro. There are at least 26 indigenous groups in Venezuela, including the YaÃßnomam√∂, Pemon, Warao people, Baniwa people, Kali'na people, Motilone Bar√≠, Ye'kuana and Yaruro. History The Natives of Cuman√° attack the mission after Gonzalez de Ocampo's slaving raid. Colored copperplate by Theodor de Bry, published in the \\"Relaci√≥n brevissima\\" It is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish Conquest; it may have been around a million people and in addition to today's peoples included groups such as the Auak√©, Caquetio, Mariche, Pemon, Piaroa and Timoto-cuicas.Others include the Aragua and Tacariguas, from the area around Lake Valencia. The number was much reduced after the Conquest, mainly through the spread of new diseases from Europe.Wunder, Sven (2003), Oil wealth and the fate of the forest: a comparative study of eight tropical countries, Routledge. p130. There were two main north-south axes of pre-Columbian population, producing maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the Llanos plains were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture. The indigenous peoples of Venezuela had already encountered crude oils and asphalts that seeped up through the ground to the surface. Known to the locals as mene, the thick, black liquid was primarily used for medicinal purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes. A palafito in the Orinoco Delta Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the city of Cuman√°. The name \\"Venezuela\\" is said to derive from palafito villages on Lake Maracaibo reminding Amerigo Vespucci of Venice (hence \\"Venezuela\\", or \\"little Venice\\"). Indian caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (circa 1530‚Äì1568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them. Historians agree that the founder of Caracas, Diego de Losada, ultimately put Tamanaco to death. Some of the resisting tribes or the leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao, and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focussed on the northern coast, but in the mid-eighteenth century the Spanish pushed further inland along the Orinoco River. Here the Ye'kuana (then known as the Makiritare) organised serious resistance in 1775 and 1776.Gott (2005:203) Under Spanish colonization, several religious orders established mission stations. The Jesuits withdrew in the 1760s, while the Capuchins found their missions of strategic significance in the War of Independence and in 1817 were brutally taken over by the forces of Simon Bolivar. For the remainder of the nineteenth century governments did little for indigenous peoples, and they were pushed away from the country's agricultural centre to the periphery. In 1913, during a rubber boom, Colonel Tomas Funes seized control of Amazonas's San Fernando de Atabapo, killing over 100 settlers. In the following nine years in which Funes controlled the town, Funes destroyed dozens of Ye'kuana villages and killed several thousand Ye'kuana.Gott (2005:204)See Los Hijos de La Luna: Monografia Anthropologica Sobre los Indios Sanema-Yanoama, Caracas, Venezuela: Editorial Arte, 1974 In October 1999 Pemon destroyed a number of electricity pylons constructed to carry electricity from the Guri Dam to Brazil. The Pemon argued that cheap electricity would encourage further development by mining companies. The $110 million project was completed in 2001. Political organization The National Council of Venezuelan Indians (Consejo Nacional Indio de Venezuela, CONIVE) was formed in 1989 and represents the majority of indigenous peoples, with 60 affiliates representing 30 peoples.Van Cott, Donna Lee (2006), \\"Turning Crisis into Opportunity: Achievements of Excluded Groups in the Andes\\", in Paul W.

It is adjacent to the parishes of Kesgrave to the north, Martlesham to the northeast, Brightwell to the east, Purdis Heath to the south and the borough of Ipswich to the west. The three parishes of Brightwell, Foxhall and Purdis Heath have a common council. The 2001 population was 151 persons in 57 households according to the census, the population having increased at the 2011 Census to 200. Foxhall was recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Foxehola\\". The history and meaning ('fox-hole') of the name Foxhall and many other place-names in the parish are studied in a paper by Briggs.Briggs, Keith \\"The place-names of Foxhall in Suffolk\\", Journal of the English Place-name Society, volume 42, 31-42 (2010) The survey mentions 1 holding under Foxhall: 15 acres valued at 2 shillings held by the Abbot of Ely. Under the heading of \\"Derneford\\", \\"which is no doubt Darnford in Foxhall, there was 80 acres and 2 acres of meadow, 3 bordars in Saxon times having 4 ploughteams when it was valued at 40 shillings, but at the time of the survey 3 ploughteams only, when it was valued at 15 shillings.\\" On the heath are several springs which give rise to the Mill River, a tributary of the River Deben. All Saints Church stood north of Mill River; it was in ruins by the mid-16th century. Much of this church building survives; the north wall is mainly intact and can still be seen put to a new use as part of the barn of Foxhall Farm. It stands at the top of a slope overlooking one of the backroads that link Foxhall Road with Bucklesham Road. Two enormous buttresses give the game away, as well as an expanse of flint amongst the red-brick. In 1530, Foxhall became an ecclesiastical hamlet to Brightwell. Despite its name the Foxhall Stadium, the home stadium of the Ipswich Witches speedway team, is actually just across the parish boundary in Kesgrave. The stadium is run by Spedeworth UK Ltd stock car promoters. More recently the banger racing Unlimited World Final has been staged here since its move from the Plough Lane venue in London. The World Final was first held at Foxhall in 2008 and proved to be a successful event. The World Final is predicted to stay at Foxhall due to the LEZ emission laws enforced in and around London making it difficult for many racers to transport their cars to the track. The stadium opened in the mid-1950s and has been in continuous operation since. Within the parish is the Nuffield Ipswich Hospital, a modern purpose-built hospital set in twenty acres of woodland. The village once had its own beer house (brewery with pub attached) called the Waddling Duck, long since demolished. There is a caravan site at Hollies Farm. Foxhall is commonly thought of as a village because of its history and because many relatively modern houses have been built along the part of Bucklesham Road that lies in the parish. However, it is just an area with a few houses bearing the name 'Foxhall'.

Dolobran is a Shingle Style house at 231 Laurel Lane in Haverford, Pennsylvania. It was designed by architect Frank Furness for shipping magnate Clement Griscom in 1881, and was expanded at least twice by Furness. The house and 146-acre (59 hectare) estate served as a summer retreat for Griscom, his wife, and five children.George E. Thomas, Jeffrey A. Cohen and Michael J. Lewis, Frank Furness: The Complete Works (Revised Edition) (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, Inc., 1996). It was named for Dolobran, the Welsh manor and estate of Griscom's ancestors.

The main house stands on the edge of a hill, with the land sloping down on the north, east and south sides to tributaries of Mill Creek.Circa 1885 photo of Dolobran. from Bryn Mawr College. Furness altered an existing stone house, turning its first and second floors into the hall and upper hall of the new house, and shooting out rooms in multiple directions.Jeffrey A. Cohen illustrated the expansion of Dolobran in a 2012 exhibit at Bryn Mawr College. Jeffrey A. Cohen, \\"Furness in Space: The Architect and Design Dialogues on the Late 19th-Century Country House,\\" Canaday Library, Bryn Mawr College, October 14 to December 21, 2012. This was one of his most exuberant and freewheeling suburban houses, featuring a stone water tower with Juliet balconies, his trademark \\"upside-down\\" brick chimneys, roofs with jerkin head gables, dormers topped with gabled, hipped, shed (and even one tall, pyramidical) roofs, a great bay window thrusting out at the top of the stairs, and a Japanese tea room appended to the wrap-around porch. Architectural historian James F. O'Gorman described the exterior as \\"a plastic chorus of towers, bays, sheds, gables, and chimneys.\\"O'Gorman, p. 51. The upper floors were clad in wood shingles, varying between shakes and fish- scales. The interior was also Japanese-influenced. The hall's walls and ceiling were paneled in dark, mahogany coffering, with a narrow, latticed stair in the center of the room rising steeply like a ship's gangway.Dolobran's hall from Lower Merion Historical Society. Surrounding this are blue-and-white, Delft-tile murals and a Jacobean chimneypiece - gifts from the Queen of the Netherlands, in gratitude for one of Griscom's ships helping to rescue a Dutch ship that was sinking.County Lines Magazine, January 30, 2012. The hall's ceiling has a large rectangular cut-out, framed by a latticed railing, that allows natural light to stream down from second-story windows. Architectural historian Michael J. Lewis sees the influence of the German Gothic Revival's \\"love of picturesque vagaries and eccentricity\\" in Dolobran. Rather than the \\"disciplined picturesque[ness]\\" of H. H. Richardson, Stanford White or Bruce Price, who \\"sought to impose classical values of calm and repose on plans that were rather irregular,\\" Furness embraced a \\"restlessness and turbulence\\" in his complex and sometimes unorthodox massing of volumes. Dolobran was an artistic breakthrough for the architect, a milestone on the road to \\"an original synthesis\\" that would inform his later buildings.Lewis, p. 153. =Circa-1888 expansion= Dolobran, circa 1890 (between the circa-1888 and 1894-95 expansions). Clement Griscom (1841-1912). The circa-1888 expansion of the house was more restrained, and included the three- story east addition - with pyramidical roof and stone chimneys - the octagonal study, and the verandah with its graceful, arching brackets. The three-story, L-shaped servant's wing - with expanded kitchen and bedrooms above - either was part of these alterations or those in 1894-95. The new interiors were in a different style and at a larger scale. Furness was exploring the Art Nouveau, and used a calla lily motif - sometimes literally, sometimes abstractly - for the mantel brackets in the drawingroom, the fireplace mosaics in the master bedroom and library, the stone carvings of the study fireplace, and a glorious leaded glass window, also in the study. The circa-1888 alterations probably included the front bedroom's buff-colored, terra-cotta fireplace and mantel, the detailing of which is closely related to the reading room of Furness's contemporaneous University of Pennsylvania Library (1888‚Äì91).O'Gorman, p. 51.Front bedroom mantel from Lower Merion Historical Society. =1894-95 expansion= With the 1894-95 expansion, Griscom turned his large house into a mansion. A library beneath the dining room, probably part of the circa-1888 alterations, had opened onto a sunken patio. Furness excavated into the hill, turning the basement library into a balcony room overlooking a subterranean art gallery. The vast two-story space - 40 by 50 feet (12.2 x 15.2 m) - is illuminated by two long strips of skylights, flanking the terrace above, and large windows at the room's east end where the hill drops away. This created an unexpectedly grand - and, importantly, fireproof - setting for Griscom's collection of landscape paintings and British portraits. The addition's exterior walls are faced with stone similar to the house's, but the art gallery's gigantic scale and Beaux-Arts formality is incongruous with the jocular informality of the original house.1901 photo of Dolobran from Bryn Mawr College. The 1894 commission may have included houses for two of Griscom's children and their families. A January 1901 magazine article notes three houses on the property.Whitney, p. 399. =1901 description= Lady Enid Layard, visited Dolobran in 1901 and described it in her journal: > 24 August 1901 - We passed through lovely towns & passed beautiful (tho‚Äô not > very old) trees‚Äîby pleasant villas till we found ourselves in abt 10 minutes > at the door of ‚ÄúDolobran.‚Äù Mrs Griscom was at the door & gave us a warm > welcome.

Before working as a media artist, he received degrees in Urban studies and Social science from the University of Birmingham, UK, and the Universit√† Iuav di Venezia. He worked extensively as a researcher in the field of structured communication techniques (such as the real-time Delphi method), and electronic democracy,, pp. 480-481. which he later used in some interactive installations. His research interests and a wide range of artworks have focused on three main dimensions of digital technologies: Sealed Computers (Nice, 1997). This installation uses computer codes to create endless flows of random images which will never be accessible for viewing. Interactive installation/CIM series (computer, audience cell phones, video projector), Art Palace, Cairo, 2008. ‚Äî the possibility of delegating his artistic action to the infinite time of the machine, such as in his Programmed Machines.

Some of these works were developed through intense cooperation with Artmedia, the Laboratory of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication, University of Salerno, and the Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art (MLAC), Sapienza University of Rome. In 2003 the MLAC published a monograph book on Bolognini's work.. In 2004 Artmedia organized a show which was aimed to highlight a European tendency in new media art, based on the concept of the technological sublime. The show included works by Roy Ascott (English), Maurizio Bolognini (Italian), Fred Forest (French), Richard Kriesche (Austrian) and Mit Mitropoulos (Greek).Mario Costa (2003), New Technologies: Ascott, Bolognini, Forest, Kriesche, Mitropoulos.

The interaction structure of the CIMs was also used in ICB (Interactive Collective Blue), in order to define a series of Democratic Blues. In 1988, Bolognini began using personal computers to generate flows of continuously expanding random images. In the 1990s, he programmed hundreds of these computers and left them to run ad infinitum (most of these are still working now). About his Programmed Machines he wrote: \\"I do not consider myself an artist who creates certain images, and I am not merely a conceptual artist. I am one whose machines have actually traced more lines than anyone else, covering boundless surfaces. I am not interested in the formal quality of the images produced by my installations but rather in their flow, their limitlessness in space and time, and the possibility of creating parallel universes of information made up of kilometres of images and infinite trajectories. My installations serve to generate out-of-control infinities.\\"Sandra Solimano (ed.) (2005), Maurizio Bolognini.

Khichra is cooked all year and particularly at the Ashura of Muharram. It is made up of goat meat, beef, lentils and spices, slowly cooked to a thick paste. It is the meat based variant of rice dish from the Indian subcontinent called Khichdi. In Pakistan, beef Haleem and Khichra is sold as street food in most cities throughout the year.Karachi Food StreetFood for thought: Haleem by any other name Origin Khichra and Haleem are basically the similar dishes as meat is grinded in Haleem while meat is in shape of cubes in Khichra.Difference between Khichri, Khichra and Haleem The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in The Sunday Guardian, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \\"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\\" of Baghdad. \\"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world‚Äôs oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\\" it reported. Harees was introduced by Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city. As per the Delhi based historian Sohail Hashmi, the Khichra originated as a famine relief measure in the North Indian city of Lucknow while building the Old Imambara of Lucknow. Due to a famine, the then Nawab of Awadh commenced the construction of an Imambargah, announcing that anyone who participated in the construction would be given free food. This free food consisted of rice slowly cooked with mutton and various pulses, thus becoming rich in protein and carbohydrates. This aided a number of famine affected people who would otherwise have died. Once the construction of the Imambargah was completed, the dish continued to get popular and can today be found not just in Lucknow, but a number of cities of the Indian subcontinent. Travellers took this dish to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it further acquired a local flavor. Haleem, Khichra and Khichri In the Indian subcontinent, both Haleem and Khichra are made with same ingredients. Haleem is cooked until the meat blends with the lentils, while in Khichra chunks of meat remains as cubes. Khichra is similar to Haleem and is a meat dish.

It is owned by the British Museum and has been called the Museum's most \\"eloquent object\\" and has been shown in a wide variety of ways. Description The sculpture was created by Crist√≥v√£o Estav√£o Canhavato, who was born in 1966 in Zavala in southern Mozambique. Canhavato works under the name Kester as part of a co-operative called Associa√ß√£o N√∫cleo de Arte. Kester's artistic education took place at the artist's collective‚Äîalthough he already had a knowledge of engineering construction. The artists collective was supported by Christian Aid and another Christian group led by Bishop Dinis Sengulane as part of an organisation called \\"Transformacao de Armas em Enxadas\\" or \\"Transforming Arms into Tools\\". The throne has been signed by the artist, but as the curators have noted, the throne has also been \\"signed\\" by termites who have traditionally damaged African wooden sculptures. Kester, the artist, points out the smiling faces that he has included in his work even though his relatives were injured by weapons like these. At the top of the right hand rifle butt is a human face, but the face was only \\"found\\" by the artist. The holes and marks are the remains of where a strap had been attached when it was carried by its owner. The symbol Kester created was the gothic shape at the back which is intended to symbolise a church. Detail of the throne's seat The \\"Transforming Arms into Tools\\" organisation supplied the decommissioned weapons to Kester and his group for this and many other related pieces of sculpture. The guns, mostly AK-47 assault rifles, were manufactured in Portugal, Eastern Europe and North Korea. The H&K; G3 rifles used to form the backrest were designed in Germany and manufactured in Portugal. They were widely used throughout West Africa. The Russian contribution of the iconic AK-47 rifle is important to the design‚Äîan AK-47, a hoe, and a book still feature on Mozambique's flag. On the front of the chair is a North Korean manufactured AKM rifle and a single PPSh-43 submachine gun, and the weapons that make up the seat were made in Poland and Czechoslovakia. The weapons in Mozambique arise from a civil war that was funded by South Africa and Rhodesia and involved emigrants from their apartheid regimes. One million people were killed and the war only ended when the Soviet Union collapsed and the funding ended. Kofi Annan said when this chair was being discussed, \\"We don't manufacture weapons, we sometimes don't even have money to buy them. How do we get these weapons to kill each other?\\" Provenance The throne was purchased by the British Museum in 2002. The sculpture had been brought to England by Christian Aid as part of an exhibition called \\"Swords into Ploughshares. Transforming Arms into Art\\". In 2005 the museum went on to commission another art work from the same group of artists in Maputo. The resulting piece was called \\"Tree of Life\\" and it was exhibited in the museum's main area from February 2005. Importance The Throne of Begoro in Ghana in the 1880s The Associa√ß√£o N√∫cleo de Arte in Maputo has been an artists' collective since the 1930s and despite the end of empire and a civil war it is still supporting artists as it did to Maputo, the painter Malangatana Ngwenya in the 1950s. The symbolism of recycling decommissioned weapons from around the world is self-evident. However, there is an added meaning because chairs can be a symbol of authority in Africa. A nineteenth century example of a chief's chair from Ghana is shown for comparison. The Throne of Weapons was sent on tour by the British Museum and has been exhibited in schools, shopping centres, museums, cathedrals, community spaces and a prison around the United Kingdom. It has travelled internationally but also toured Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England. It has been called the Museum's most \\"eloquent object\\" and may have been shown in a wider variety of ways than any other artifact. The sculpture was chosen to be featured in A History of the World in 100 Objects, a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 as a collaboration between the BBC and the British Museum.

The garden covering at his Vermont home became a tourist attraction to visitors from around the world. Biography Winterrowd, who was born on October 29, 1941, in Shreveport, Louisiana, started gardening when he was three years old and read widely on the subject while he was growing up. Visits to an aunt who lived near Lake Pontchartrain helped him learn about gardening and he developed an interest in tropical plants on family trips to Florida and Cuba. He attended Louisiana State University, where he completed his bachelor's and master's degrees, and had completed all but the dissertation needed for a doctorate in Jacobean literature.Raver, Ann. \\"Wayne Winterrowd, Gardening Expert, Dies at 68\\", The New York Times, September 24, 2010. Accessed September 29, 2010. While teaching Jacobean literature at Tufts University in 1969, he first met Joe Eck, and they lived together in Denmark where Winterrowd had earned a Fulbright scholarship. Together with Eck, Winterrowd learned as much as they could about gardening and earned a living by teaching English, French and Latin at area elementary and high schools. They spent the 1960s and 1970s as part of the homegrown food movement. During the 1980s, Winterrowd wrote lengthy articles for Horticulture, reaching to as many as 3,000 words, in which he intertwined his experiences in gardening with Classic literature and Southern folklore. Moving from a farmhouse in Pepperell, Massachusetts to Readsboro, Vermont, Winterrowd and Eck devoted themselves to create a garden called North Hill, in which they grew Himalayan blue poppies, Japanese dogwoods, locust trees, magnolia, and stewartias. They cleared the hilly wooded land they had acquired, planting a diverse variety of plants, including as many as 100,000 daffodil bulbs.Higgins, Adrian. \\"Wayne Winterrowd, 68: Writer created a garden paradise at Vt. home\\", The Washington Post, September 27, 2010. Accessed September 28, 2010. The garden drew visitors from around the world to their home in Southern Vermont near the Massachusetts border. They also grew fresh vegetables and raised dairy cows, pigs and poultry. Roger Swain, host of the Public Broadcasting Service television series The Victory Garden said \\"Their garden is of such quality and diversity that it rivals any in Europe.

The mechanics and the movements of the robot are biologically-inspired, mimicking the stick insect Carausius Morosus. The development of the LAURON walking robot started with basic research in field of six-legged locomotion in the early 1990s and led to the first robot, called LAURON. In the year 1994, this robot was presented to public at the CeBIT in Hanover. This first LAURON generation was, in contrast to the current generation, controlled by an artificial neural network, hence the robot's German name: LAUfROboter Neuronal gesteuert (English: Walking Robot, Neural Controlled). The current generation LARUON V was finished in 2013. __TOC__ Overview This biologically-inspired walking robot was developed to study and realize statically stable walking in rough terrain. Because of the flexible behavior- based control system, LAURON is capable of adapting to unknown situations very well. Through the robust mechanical design, different walking patterns and high number of degrees of freedom, LAURON can maintain a stable locomotion even under extreme circumstances. A panoramic camera was installed on the back of LAURON for teleoperation tasks. This camera gives the operator a good overview of the robot and its local environment at all times. By the use of augmented reality glasses the operator can see additional status information overlaid onto the camera images and displayed in the glasses. LAURON is able to gather information about its environment and plan a path towards a given goal autonomously. While walking LAURON can detect obstacles and then either walk over them or around them, if the obstacles are too high The walking robot is intended to be used in inspection and maintenance tasks in rough and for humans hazardous areas like landmine detection, exploration of volcanoes or search and rescue missions after natural disasters. Models =LAURON I (since approx. 1994)= LAURON I - now in the biggest German museum of science and technology Deutsches Museum LAURON I was finished in late 1993 and then presented to public at the CeBit 1994. It was constructed of aluminum and fiber-reinforced plastics with an overall weight of 11 kg. The robot was controlled by artificial neural networks. The construction and design was strongly inspired by the stick insect. =LAURON II (since approx. 1995)= The second generation of LAURON was developed and built from 1995‚Äì96. The main features were a changed mechanical design and some additional sensors like force sensors in the feet and an inclinometer. Because the new legs were now build of aluminum the overall weight of LAURON II increased to 16 kg. It has a maximum payload of 20 kg and a maximum speed of 50 cm/s LAURON II was used as a test platform for validating various control strategies and for machine learning. =LAURON III (since approx. 1999)= In 1999 the third LAURON generation was built. With an overall weight of 18 kg the robot was now able to carry a payload of up to 10 kg. Each leg has three degrees of freedom, and each foot has force sensors on all three axes. The artificial neural networks of the previous generations were replaced by a modular reactive control system. Now, the research focus shifted to topics like robot localization, navigation and environment modeling. =LAURON IV (since approx. 2004)= The fourth generation of LAURON was finished in 2004. The mechanical robustness was improved, for example the round cord belt connecting the joints with the motors were replaced by gear belts. Beside, a new head with 2 degrees of freedom was added. The central body was now made of light-weight carbon fiber. LAURON IV weights 27 kg including its accumulators and can reach a maximum walking speed of up to 0.22 m/s. Furthermore, the used NiMH accumulators can supply LAURON with energy for up to 60 minutes. The current version of the fourth LAURON generation is LAURON IVc. The LAURON IV won the Faulhaber University Project Award in 2011. =LAURON V (since approx. 2013)= The fifth LAURON generation was introduced and demonstrated at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2013 in Karlsruhe Germany. The flexibility and maneuverability of LAURON V was improved by adding another rotational joint to each leg close to the main body. This joint enlarged each leg's workspace and allows LAURON to orient its feet towards the ground. The mounting angles of the six legs were optimized to additionally increase the overall workspace, improve the support polygon, and enable LAURON V to manipulate objects with its front legs. With its insect like kinematic structure and behavior-based control system LAURON is able to cope with difficult, rough terrain.

It is a category A listed building. History The castle was begun in 1590 for Thomas Hay, the son of one of the Commendators of Glenluce Abbey, and his wife Jonet MakDouel. It was completed by 1599. The building was extended in the 18th century, and was used by the Hay family until Sir John Dalrymple-Hay sold the Park estate in 1875; it was then left uninhabited. The Cunningham family acquired Castle of Park in 1830. They later abandoned Castle of Park in favour of Dunragit House, using Castle of Park to house farm laborers. It is reported that Castle of Park is haunted by the ghost of a Monk who was murdered by walling him up in one of the rooms. A green lady who became pregnant whilst working at the castle has also been seen through the years. A program of restoration was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, including removal of the 18th-century wings. In the 1980s, additional work was done by the Landmark Trust. The building is now maintained using income from its use as holiday accommodation. At various times the building has also been known as \\"Park Hay\\", \\"The Park O' Luce\\", \\"Park Castle\\" and \\"Park House\\". Description The building is divided into four floors.

Early life Ledyard was born in New York City on March 5, 1812, the son of prominent New York lawyer Benjamin Ledyard (1779‚Äì1812) and Susan French Livingston (1789‚Äì1864). His mother was the daughter of Revolutionary War Colonel and US Supreme Court justice Henry Brockholst Livingston (1757‚Äì1823) and granddaughter of New Jersey governor William Livingston. Ledyard graduated from Columbia College in 1830, and began practicing law in New York. When Lewis Cass was appointed Minister to France, Ledyard accompanied him to Paris, eventually becoming charg√© d‚Äôaffaires of the embassy. Career Ledyard returned to the United States in 1844 and moved to Detroit, where he was active in the city and managed Cass's property holdings. He was one of the founders of the State Savings Bank, one of the original promoters of the Elmwood Cemetery, and was a member of the Board of Education. He organized and promoted the first plank road company in Michigan, and was involved in a number of other ventures that promoted communication between Detroit and the interior of the state. In 1849-1850 he was an alderman of the city, and served as mayor in 1855 and was one of the original commissioners on the Board of Water Commissioners. Ledyard was a Democrat, and was elected as a state senator in 1857. However, when Lewis Cass was appointed Secretary of State under James Buchanan, Ledyard resigned his post in the legislature and accompanied him to Washington, DC, and remained there until 1861, briefly serving as assistant secretary of state. Afterwards, he moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where he lived for the rest of his life.

The reason behind the discontinuation was that; two years ago, the Nepalese government had ordered the company to upgrade the engines to Euro III standards. The executives say that they could not find a perfect Euro III standard engine, exhibiting high performance in both normal and hilly roads before the deadline expired. They also lobbied for the government to extend the expiry date of the deadline they had to meet. On July 8, 2016, it was announced that Hulas Motors had begun the production of an all electric passenger car, and is currently undergoing testing in various areas of Nepal, including Kathmandu city, and other rural and hilly areas.

It is found throughout Europe with exception of Ireland and the Balkan Peninsula, and in Japan, where it occurs on the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu. Appearance Adult specimens of Bucculatrix thoracella are small, with a wingspan of 6‚Äì8 mm, and have a wing pattern of dark brown blotches on a yellow base, with a brown line extending to the wing's edge. Larvae have a pale, greenish yellow body and a pale yellow head. Pupae are a dark, cloudy brown, and are covered by a strongly ribbed white, yellowish or greyish brown cocoon. Behaviour In continental Europe, Bucculatrix thoracella occurs in two generations per year, whereas it is generally univoltine in most of Britain. It overwinters as pupa, either on the host plant's trunk or in leaf litter. Adults are on wing in June and sometimes August in Britain, while in continental Europe they are on wing from April to May and from July to August. Eggs are left on the underside of leaves, often at a vein angle. =Larvae= Larvae feed mainly on species of lime tree (Tilia spp.) and less commonly on maple species (Acer spp.), but infrequent records of a variety of other host plants exist. During the first larval stadium, they mine their host plant's leaves, resulting in a small, hook-like mine. The mine starts with a small blotch at the angle of leaf veins, then follows in a straight line along the vein, eventually turning away and forming a hook-like shape. When the larva emerges from its mine, it moults in a smooth cocoonet. Afterwards, it feeds externally from the leaf's underside, eating out windows in the leaf. Host plants Per Plant Parasites of Europe, known host plants include multiple species of maple (Acer campestre, Acer platanoides and Acer pseudoplatanus); Aesculus hippocastanum; Alnus; Betula; Carpinus betulus; Castanea sativa; Fagus sylvatica; Sorbus; and several species of lime tree (Tilia cordata, Tilia √ó euchlora, Tilia √ó europaea, Tilia platyphyllos and Tilia tomentosa). Kobayashi, Hirowatari & Kuroko (2010) additionally report Tilia japonica. In parts of its range, it is found solely or nearly so on Tilia spp. Within Great-Britain, a preference exists for Tilia cordata over Tilia √ó europaea where both are present.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History Littleborough stands on the site of the Roman town of Segelocum (or Agelocum), which was adjacent to a ford crossing the River Trent on the Roman road between Lincoln and York, by way of Doncaster. Littleborough is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, and there is speculation that the church was founded by William the Conqueror, as it stands in what was his manor of Mansfield. The church was probably built in the second half of the 11th century. It was restored in 1832, when the vestry was added. The vestry was rebuilt in 1900, and the church was restored again in 1973. It was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 April 1993. Architecture =Exterior= St Nicholas is a small church constructed of rubble which includes brick and Roman brick fragments. This is coursed in places and elsewhere it is in herring-bone design. The church has dressed stone quoins, ashlar dressings, and slate roofs. Its plan is simple, consisting of a two-bay nave, a single-bay chancel and a lean-to north vestry. On the west gable is a double bellcote, and on the east gable is a cross. At the west end of the church is a round-headed doorway, flanked by buttresses. On the north side of the church is a brick chimney stack and a single round-headed window. On the south side are two 19th-century round- headed windows. At the east end of the chancel is a single 19th-century round- headed window, and there is a similar window in the south wall. On the north side of the vestry is a three-light mullioned and transomed window. =Interior= The chancel arch dates from the 11th century. It incorporates two Saxon pillars. In the east window is stained glass dating from 1900. In the south wall of the chancel is a 14th-century trefoil-headed piscina. The font has a square base and a 17th-century eggcup-shaped bowl. Its cover dates from about the 18th century, and is domed with a ball finial. The lectern and reading desk date from the 19th century, and the oak benches from about 1900. The monuments date from between 1765 and 1855.

The concept was launched when maritime authorities from seven nations requested the IMO‚Äôs Maritime Safety Committee to add the development of an e-navigation strategy to the work programs of the IMO's NAV and COMSAR sub-committees. Working groups in three sub-committees (NAV, COMSAR and STW) and an intersessional correspondence group, led by Norway, has subsequently developed a Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP). Member states of IMO and a number of Intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations have contributed to the work, including the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Comit√© International Radio-Maritime (CIRM), the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Background An input paper to IMO‚Äôs Maritime Safety Committee‚Äôs 81st session in 2005 from Japan, Marshall Islands, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore and the United Kingdom and the United States identified that there was a clear need to equip the master of a vessel, and those responsible for the safety of shipping ashore, with modern proven tools to make marine navigation and communications more reliable and thereby reduce errors ‚àí especially those with a potential for loss of life, injury, environmental damage and undue commercial costs. It also identified that more substantial and widespread benefits for States, shipowners and seafarers could be expected to arise from the increased safety at sea, which was identified as the core objective of e-navigation. Also according to the United Kingdom‚Äôs Marine Accident Investigation Branch, navigational errors and failures, including those of the human element, had been significant in over half of the incidents meriting a full investigation between 2002 and 2005. The input paper also noted that accidents related to navigation continue to occur despite the development and availability of a number of ship- and shore-based technologies that improve situational awareness and decision-making. These include the Automatic Identification System (AIS), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), Integrated Bridge Systems/Integrated Navigation Systems (IBS/INS), Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA), radio navigation, Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) systems, Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) and the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). It was therefore proposed to add a new item on e-navigation to the work programme of the Sub- Committee on Safety of Navigation (NAV) and also to that on Radiocommunications and Search and Rescue (COMSAR). The aim was to develop a strategic vision for the utilization of existing and new navigational tools, in particular electronic tools, in a holistic and systematic manner. e-navigation can thereby help reduce navigational accidents, errors and failures by developing standards for an accurate and cost-effective system that would make a major contribution to the IMO‚Äôs agenda of safe, secure and efficient shipping on clean oceans. =Human Element, Training and Harmonization= The last decades have seen huge developments in technology within navigation and communication systems. Sophisticated and advanced technology is developing rapidly. Mariners have never had more technological support systems than today and therefore there is a need to coordinate systems and more use of harmonised standards. Although ships now carry Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) and will soon all have reliable Electronic Chart Displays and Information Systems (ECDIS), their use on board is not fully integrated and harmonised with other existing systems and those of other ships and ashore. At the same time it has been identified that the human element, including training, competency, language skills, workload and motivation are essential in today‚Äôs world. Administrative burden, information overload and ergonomics are prominent concerns. A clear need has been identified for the application of good ergonomic principles in a well- structured human machine interface as part of the e-navigation strategy. =e-Navigation definition= At MSC 85, the Committee, taking into account inputs from the industry and other relevant organizations (e.g., IALA and IHO), approved the Strategy for the development and implementation of e-navigation and developed the following definition of e-navigation: e-navigation is the harmonized collection, integration, exchange, presentation and analysis of marine information on board and ashore by electronic means to enhance berth to berth navigation and related services for safety and security at sea and protection of the marine environment. =Benefits for users and stakeholders= On a global level e-navigation will: *Standardize bridge design which globally enhances the opportunity to work cross-border, improves efficiency in training and reduces material cost. Similarities between nations and vessels would also increase efficiency and improve safety. *Reduce barriers of trade through reduction of local solutions and bureaucracy. *Reduce the risk of accidents and incidents. For Coastal states, Flag states and Port states e-navigation will: *Improve efficiency in training, certification and supervision; *Improve situational awareness by providing easy access to standard and reliable information; *Improve efficiency in supervision, coordination, control, as well as coordination and information; *Reduce the risk of accidents and incidents through efficient use of VTS services. For branches, organizations and industry e-navigation will: *Provide flexibility with regards to training and rotation as standardization would lead to a more efficient market for standardized bridge products; *Simplify reporting and thereby reducing the workload for operations; *Improve safety for own fleet; *Improve situational awareness for bridge personnel and thereby improving the speed and efficiency of decision making; *Increase navigational safety in VTS regulated areas; *Provide a direction for product development to a wide market; *Provide opportunity for new products and solutions; For ship borne users e-navigation will: *Simplify daily work and training; *Improve human-machine interface, usability, familiarity and navigational safety; *Improve time-saving and efficiency on board by providing easier access to information, thereby improving the response time/problem solving abilities of bridge personnel; *Improved navigational safety by reducing the administrative workload; *Improve confidence in the use of navigational equipment; *Enhance the quality, accuracy and reliability of information, thereby improving situational awareness and navigational safety; *Provide easy access to need- to-know information in a user friendly single window; *Improve familiarity with systems through standardization; *Improve service and safety in VTS- regulated areas by providing easy access to available services and warnings *Reduce bureaucracy and thereby support more efficient use of bridge resources; *Reduce the risk of accidents; e-navigation Strategy The IMO entrusted Norway and the Norwegian Coastal Administration to coordinate the work of developing a proposal for an e-navigation strategy implementation plan. Three sub-committees within the IMO - NAV, COMSAR and STW - established working groups on e-navigation; each group was chaired by John Erik Hagen of the Norwegian Coastal Administration. Further, a correspondence group overseen by the Norwegian Coastal Administration had an ongoing role in gathering input from national maritime administrations to proposals and decisions related to the process of establishing an e-navigation Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP). The work on an e-navigation Strategy Implementation Plan was broken down into several clear phases: #Assessing user needs #Constructing an open, modular and scalable architecture #Completing a series of studies: a gap analysis, cost-benefit analysis and a risk analysis =Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP)= With these phases complete, five agreed solutions were proposed to provide the basis for a Strategy Implementation Plan. These are: S1: improved, harmonized and user friendly bridge design; S2: means for standardized and automated reporting; S3: improved reliability, resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information; S4: integration and presentation of available information in graphical displays received via communications equipment; and S9: improved communication of VTS Service Portfolio. S1, S3 and S4 address the equipment and its use on the ship, while S2 and S9 address improved communications between ships and ship to shore and shore to ship. During the development of the SIP a number of tasks have been identified in order to continue the further development and implementation of e-navigation. Some of these tasks may require further consideration and investigation before taking a final decision on the best way forward and subsequent tasks. Further it was recognised that there is a need to identify shore-based functions and services. At present, there are many different types of services in most given situations or locations, such as ports, coastal and high seas. Harmonising and standardising these services results in the Maritime Service Portfolios (MSPs). =Core elements to the Plan= The final e-Navigation Strategy Implementation Plan contains eight core elements, defined thus: #Identification of tasks needed to be completed to satisfy the Solutions #A phasing of the tasks and a high level roadmap #A list of Maritime Service Portfolios that need to be developed #A list of key enablers of e-navigation #The continual assessment of user needs #Proposals for a systematic assessment of how new technology can best meet defined and evolving user needs in the longer term #Proposals on public relations and promotion of the e-navigation concept to key stakeholder groups #Identification of potential sources of funding for development and implementation, particularly for developing regions and countries and of actions to secure that funding. =Guidelines= The combination of the five e-navigation solutions, and the three guidelines, Guidelines on Human Centred Design (HCD) for e-navigation, Guidelines on Usability Testing, Evaluation and Assessment (U-TEA) for e-navigation systems and Guidelines for Software Quality Assurance (SQA) in e-navigation, proposes an e-navigation implementation that facilitates a holistic approach to the interaction between shipboard and shore-based users. Way Forward The SIP was presented to the new IMO sub-committee NCSR (Navigation Communication Search and Rescue) in June 2014 for endorsement, and forwarded from there to the Maritime Safety Committee where it was approved in November 2014. Along with work taking place under the aegis of the IMO, a number of public and private groups are working to advance e-navigation and topics related to e-navigation.

After being denied Belgian permanent residence, Tania deliberately burns her fingers to remove her fingerprints and avoid identification. Tania advises her Belarusian friend Zina to apply for political asylum, since Belarus is considered a dictatorship by Belgians, but Zina seems to dismiss Tania's advice. Tania is caught, but she tells Ivan to run. She refuses to tell her name, hoping to be released after 5 months, as she is told by another illegal. Ivan comes to live with Zina. Tania is eager to start working in the detention center to earn money to phone him from time to time. Ivan wants to start working to earn his living. However, Tania is worried that it will be criminal work. Ivan wants to visit her, but she does not want that, it could make things worse. Authorities threaten to put her in jail for two years for giving a false name when applying for medical insurance. Desperate, Tania identifies as Zina and applies for political asylum, as a Belarusian. But then she is surprised to learn that Zina has already asked for asylum before, in Poland. Eventually Tania (as Zina) is forced into a plane to be deported to Poland. However, other passengers protest, and she is taken off the plane. After being beaten on her way back to the detention center, she awakens in a hospital, and manages to escape the sleeping guard, to finally reunite with her son Ivan.

The 16th-century Babri Mosque in the city of Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh, had been the subject of a lengthy socio-political dispute, and was targeted after a political rally organised by Hindu nationalist organisations turned violent. In Hindu tradition, the city of Ayodhya is the birthplace of Rama. In the 16th century a Mughal general, Mir Baqi, had built a mosque, known as the Babri Masjid at a site identified by some Hindus as Ram Janmabhoomi, or the birthplace of Rama. The Archaeological Survey of India states that the mosque was built on land where a non-Islamic structure had previously existed. In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its political voice. Several rallies and marches were held as a part of this movement, including the Ram Rath Yatra led by L. K. Advani. On 6 December 1992 the VHP and the BJP organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as kar sevaks. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed security forces and tore down the mosque. A subsequent inquiry into the incident found 68 people responsible, including several leaders of the BJP and the VHP. The demolition resulted in several months of intercommunal rioting between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people. Retaliatory violence against Hindus also occurred in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Background In Hinduism the birthplace of the deity Rama, known as \\"Ram Janmabhoomi\\", is considered a holy site. This site is often believed to be at the place where the Babri Masjid stood in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh: historical evidence to support this belief is scarce. There is a rough scholarly consensus that in 1528, following the Mughal conquest of the region, a mosque was built at the site by the Mughal general Mir Baqi, and named the \\"Babri Masjid\\" after the Mughal emperor Babur. Popular belief holds that Baqi demolished a temple of Rama to build the mosque; historical basis for the belief is debated. Archaeological evidence has been found of a structure pre-dating the mosque. This structure has been variously identified as a Hindu temple and a Buddhist structure. For at least four centuries, the site was used for religious purposes by both Hindus and Muslims. The claim that the mosque stood on the site of a temple was first made in 1822, by an official of the Faizabad court. The Nirmohi Akhara sect cited this statement in laying claim to the site later in the 19th century, leading to the first recorded incidents of religious violence at the site in 1855. In 1859 the British colonial administration set up a railing to separate the outer courtyard of the mosque to avoid disputes. The status quo remained in place until 1949, when idols of Rama were surreptitiously placed inside the mosque, allegedly by volunteers of the Hindu Mahasabha. This led to an uproar, with both parties filing civil suits laying claim to the land. The placement of the idols was seen as a desecration by the users of the Masjid. The site was declared to be in dispute, and the gates to the Masjid were locked. { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 82.19440090673744, 26.79567601448159 ] } } ] } In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its political voice. The movement was bolstered by the decision of a district judge, who ruled in 1986 that the gates would be reopened and Hindus permitted to worship there. This decision was endorsed by Indian National Congress politician Rajiv Gandhi, then the Prime Minister of India, who sought to regain support from Hindus he had lost over the Shah Bano controversy. Nonetheless, the Congress lost the 1989 general election, and the BJP's strength in parliament grew from 2 members to 88, making its support crucial to the new government of V. P. Singh. In September 1990, BJP leader L. K. Advani began a Rath Yatra, a political rally travelling across much of north India to Ayodhya. The yatra sought to generate support for the proposed temple, and also sought to unite Hindu votes by mobilizing anti-Muslim sentiment. Advani was arrested by the government of Bihar before he could reach Ayodhya. Despite this, a large body of kar sevaks or Sangh Parivar activists reached Ayodhya and attempted to attack the mosque. This resulted in a pitched battle with the paramilitary forces that ended with the death of several kar sevaks. The BJP withdrew its support to the V. P. Singh ministry, necessitating fresh elections. The BJP substantially increased its tally in the union parliament, as well as winning a majority in the Uttar Pradesh assembly. Demolition On 6 December 1992, the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving 150,000 VHP and BJP kar sevaks at the site of the disputed structure. The ceremonies included speeches by BJP leaders such as Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti. During the first few hours of the rally, the crowd grew gradually more restless, and began raising slogans. A police cordon had been placed around the structure in preparation for attack. However, around noon, a young man managed to slip past the cordon and climb the structure itself, brandishing a saffron flag. This was seen as a signal by the mob, who then stormed the structure. The police cordon, vastly outnumbered and unprepared for the size of the attack, fled. The mob set upon the building with axes, hammers, and grappling hooks, and within a few hours, the entire structure, made from mud and chalk, was levelled. A 2009 report, authored by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found 68 people to be responsible for the demolition of the Masjid, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, Joshi and Vijay Raje Scindia. Kalyan Singh, who was then the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, also faced severe criticism in the report. Liberhan wrote that he posted bureaucrats and police officers to Ayodhya, whose record indicated that they would stay silent during the mosque's demolition. Anju Gupta, a police officer who had been in charge of Advani's security on that day, stated that Advani and Joshi made speeches that contributed to provoking the behaviour of the mob. The report notes that at this time several BJP leaders made \\"feeble requests to the kar sevaks to come down... either in earnest or for the media's benefit\\". No appeal was made to the Kar Sevaks not to enter the sanctum sanctorum or not to demolish the structure. It further noted: \\"This selected act of the leaders itself speaks of the hidden intentions of one and all being to accomplish demolition of the disputed structure.\\" The report holds that the \\"icons of the movement present [that day]... could just as easily have... prevented the demolition.\\" =Conspiracy allegations= In a March 2005 book, former Intelligence Bureau head Maloy Krishna Dhar claimed that Babri mosque demolition was planned 10 months in advance by top leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), BJP and VHP, and criticised the manner in which the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao handled the issue. Dhar claimed that he was directed to arrange security for a meeting between individuals from the BJP and other constituents of the Sangh Parivar, and that the meeting \\"proved beyond doubt that they (RSS, BJP, VHP) had drawn up the blueprint of the Hindutva assault in the coming months and choreographed the pralaya nritya (dance of destruction) at Ayodhya in December 1992. The RSS, BJP, VHP and the Bajrang Dal leaders present in the meeting amply agreed to work in a well-orchestrated manner.\\" Claiming that the tapes of the meeting were personally handed over by him to his boss, he asserts that he has no doubts that his boss had shared the contents with the Prime Minister (Rao) and the Home Minister (Shankarrao Chavan). The author claimed that there was silent agreement that Ayodhya offered \\"a unique opportunity to take the Hindutva wave to the peak for deriving political benefit.\\" In April 2014, a sting operation by Cobrapost claimed that the demolition was not an act of frenzied mobs but an act of sabotage planned with so much secrecy that no government agency got wind of it. It further said that the sabotage was planned several months in advance by Vishva Hindu Parishad and Shiv Sena, but not jointly. Aftermath =Communal violence= The destruction of the Babri Mosque sparked Muslim outrage around the country, provoking several months of inter-communal rioting in which Hindus and Muslims attacked one another, burning and looting homes, shops and places of worship. Several of the BJP leaders were taken into custody, and the VHP was briefly banned by the government. Despite this, the ensuing riots spread to cities like Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Kanpur, Delhi, Bhopal and several others, eventually resulting in over 2000 deaths, mainly Muslim. The Mumbai Riots alone, which occurred in December 1992 and January 1993 and which the Shiv Sena played a big part in organising, caused the death of around 900 people, and estimated property damage of around 9,000 crore ($3.6 billion).ERCES Online Quarterly Review Religious Identity of the Perpetrators and Victims of Communal Violence in Post-Independence India The demolition and the ensuing riots were among the major factors behind the 1993 Mumbai bombings and many successive riots in the coming decade. Jihadi groups including the Indian Mujahideen cited the demolition of the Babri Mosque as a reason for their terrorist attacks. =Investigation= On 16 December 1992, the Union home ministry set up the Liberhan Commission to investigate the destruction of the Mosque, headed by retired High Court Judge M. S. Liberhan. After 399 sittings over sixteen years, the Commission submitted its 1,029-page report to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 30 June 2009. According to the report, the events of 6 December 1992, in Ayodhya were \\"neither spontaneous nor unplanned\\". In March 2015, the Supreme Court of India admitted a petition alleging that, with a BJP government in power, the CBI would not pursue conspiracy charges against senior BJP leaders including L. K. Advani and Rajnath Singh. The Court asked the CBI to explain its delay in filing an appeal.Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court to hear plea claiming CBI may go soft on L K Advani, Indian Express, 31 March 2015.Babri Masjid case: SC issues notices to L K Advani, others over conspiracy charges, Indian Express, 31 March 2015. In April 2017, a special Central Bureau of Investigation court framed criminal conspiracy charges against Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, and several others. On 30th September 2020, the court acquitted all the 32 accused including L.K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and several others in the case on account of inconclusive evidence. The special court judge said \\"‚ÄúThe demolition was not pre-planned.‚Äù https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/30/indian-court-acquits-all-accused-in- babri-mosque-demolition-case International reactions Ayodhya city =Pakistan= In Pakistan, the government closed offices and schools on 7 December to protest against the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned the Indian ambassador to lodge a formal complaint, and promised to appeal to the United Nations and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to pressure India to protect the rights of Muslims. Strikes were held across the country, while Muslim mobs attacked and destroyed as many as 30 temples in one day by means of fire and bulldozers, and stormed the office of Air India, India's national airline, in Lahore. The retaliatory attacks included rhetoric from mobs calling for the destruction of India and of Hinduism. Students from the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad burned an effigy of the then-Prime Minister of India, P.V. Narasimha Rao, and called for \\"Jihad\\" against Hindus. In subsequent years, thousands of Pakistani Hindus visiting India sought longer visas, and in some cases citizenship of India, citing increased harassment and discrimination in the aftermath of the demolition. =Bangladesh= Following the demolition, Muslim mobs in Bangladesh attacked and burned down Hindu temples, shops and houses across the country. An India-Bangladesh cricket match was disrupted when a mob of an estimated 5,000 men tried to storm the Bangabandhu National Stadium in the national capital of Dhaka. The Dhaka office of Air India was stormed and destroyed. 10 people were reportedly killed, 11 Hindu temples and several homes destroyed. The aftermath of the violence forced the Bangladeshi Hindu community to curtail the celebrations of Durga Puja in 1993 while calling for the destroyed temples to be repaired and investigations be held into the atrocities. =Middle East= At its summit meeting in Abu Dhabi, the Gulf Cooperation Council strongly condemned the Babri Masjid demolition. It adopted a resolution which described the act as a \\"crime against Muslim holy places.\\" Among its member states, Saudi Arabia severely condemned the act. The United Arab Emirates, home to large expatriate communities of Indians and Pakistanis, conveyed a more moderate reaction. In response, the Indian government criticised the GCC for what it regarded as interference in its internal affairs. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the demolition, and called upon India to do more to protect its Muslim population. Although its government condemned the events, the UAE experienced severe public disturbances due to the demolition of the Babri Mosque. Street protests broke out, and protesters threw stones at a Hindu temple and the Indian Consulate in Dubai. In Al-Ain, 250 km east of Abu Dhabi, angry mobs set fire to the girls wing of an Indian school. In response to the violence, UAE police arrested and deported many expatriate Pakistanis and Indians who had participated in the violence. The Commander-in-Chief of the Dubai police force, Dhahi Khalfan, condemned the violence by foreign nationals in his country. In popular culture Malayalam author N. S. Madhavan's story Thiruthu is based on the Babri masjid demolition. The Ayodhya dispute and the riots following the demolition of the Babri Masjid form part of the backdrop to Antara Ganguly's 2016 novel, Tanya Tania. Lajja (Shame), a 1993 novel by Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin, was partially inspired by the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh that intensified after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The documentary Ram ke Naam (In the name of Ram) by Anand Patwardhan examines the events preceding the demolition. The Bollywood film Mausam is based on the events surrounding the demolition. The events riots that followed the demolition are an important part of the plot of several films, including Bombay (1995) set in the Bombay riots. Daivanamathil (2005) explores the repercussions of the demolition on Muslims in Kerala. Both Bombay and Daivanamathi won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration at the respective National Film Awards. The 2007 film Black Friday was based upon the 1993 Bombay bombings which were considered to be the after effect of the demolition of the mosque.

She was educated in Scotland, the land of her mother, and at Frensham school for girls in Mittagong. She studied literature at the University of Western Australia and art in Henri Van Raalte's Perth studio. She married Geoff Drake-Brockman, then Commissioner for north western Australia, in 1921. Writing career Both Henrietta and her husband wrote about their travels in articles for The West Australian. The travels were also sources for her novels. By the time the couple returned to Perth in 1926, Henrietta's reputation as a writer had become established. From her experiences of the North-West, she had written sketches and stories, and in the early 1930s published a serial, The Disquieting Sex. Blue North, an historical novel about life in the 1870s, was serialised in The Bulletin and published in 1934, while Sheba Lane used contemporary Broome as its setting. Younger Sons was a carefully documented novel of Western Australian settlement and The Fatal Days (1947) focussed on Ballarat, Victoria, during World War II. Her last novel, The Wicked and The Fair (1957), centred on the voyage of the Batavia in 1629. Her final book, Voyage To Disaster (1963), was largely a biography of the Batavia's captain Francisco Pelsaert. Her extensive research entailed the use of material from Dutch archives and of E. D. Drok's translations of Pelsaert's journals, as well as trips by sea and air to the probable site of the wreck. In an article in Walkabout in January 1955, Henrietta diverged from general opinion and closely estimated the Batavias correct resting place. Eight years later, in 1963 she became one of the four acknowledged co-discoverers of the Batavia wreck. She used an aqualung to inspect the wreck of the vessel off the Abrolhos Islands.Cowan, Peter, 'Drake-Brockman, Henrietta Frances York (1901‚Äì1968)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, 1996, pp 34‚Äì35.

The illustrations were provided by Elizabeth Durack. This edition was chosen by the Children's Book Council of Australia as \\"Book of the Year\\" for 1954. She was also co-editor with Walter Murdoch of Australian Short Stories.Walter Murdoch and Henrietta Drake-Brockman (1997) Classic Australian Short Stories Oxford University Press, Melbourne, (First published as: Australian Short Stories, Oxford University Press, London, 1951.) Playwriting career Drake-Brockman also wrote for the theatre in Perth during the 1930s and '40s. Claiming that she would rather have been a playwright than a novelist, and that there were almost no opportunities for Australian plays when she had begun to write, Henrietta did manage to have some of her plays staged. The Man from the Bush was produced in Perth in 1932 (and later in Melbourne), Dampier's Ghost was performed in 1934 and The Blister in 1937. In her best-known play, Men Without Wives, she extended her work beyond the one-act genre and won a sesquicentenary drama prize in 1938. Men Without Wives and Other Plays was published in 1955. Her plays, for the most part, depicted the people and isolated places of her earlier fiction. She admired and wrote on the work of Katharine Susannah Prichard.

Cyril and Methodius University. The tomb was reconstructed in 2014 by the Ministry of Culture of Macedonia with financial contribution from the Ministry of Culture and Sports of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after having been destroyed in the 1963 earthquake. There has been a dilemma among scientists and the local population if it is a cult place or a personal cult which has got several tombs at different locations. The mausoleum of the king's daughter (princess) takes place among Islamic-Oriental sacral objects, also among Ottoman-Bosniak, and broadly spoken, of Macedonian cultural heritage in the Balkan Peninsula. History The original t√ºrbe in the early 20th century Historical sources cannot give the information when was the mausoleum built. Although there is no scripture on the mausoleum or on its remnants, which could determine its age, it can surely be stated that it has been built at the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century. Some of the studies, especially the one issued by Vera ƒêorƒëeviƒá: The Grave Of The \\"Kings Daughter\\" in Skopje, cannot be taken into account because of its arbitrariness and inaccuracy regarding historical facts about this cultural and religious artifact belonging to the early ages of the Ottoman rule on the Balkan peninsula. It is important to emphasize that, a bit earlier, Smail Softiƒá, at the time a student in the \\"King Alexander I\\" Madrasah in Skopje has shown interest about the history of the mausoleum. We have no information about the date of her death, thus we cannot conclude that the wearing of black veils in that time is a sign for grievance. It is more logical that the black color was chosen because of the climate. ‚ÄûIn memory of Katarina, the Bosnian queen and widow who distinguished herself in patience, hygiene, piety and humility.‚Äú The portrait of the queen is placed in the Vatican, The Sistine Chapel, on the Roselli‚Äôs diptych named ‚ÄûSpeech at the hill‚Äú right next to the Pope Sixtus IV, in the company of the captains, the maids of honor and her son. According to another version Sigismund and Katarina, as a prince and a princess of Bosnia, were heading towards Istanbul. Ishak Beg Ishakoviƒá, a famous border guard aristocrat, was responsible for the safety of their journey. The princess fell ill underway, in Skopje they tried to heal her, but she died there and Sigismund carried on heading towards Istanbul. After receiving the information about the death of the young princess, Ottoman sultan Mehmed II ordered the building of a mausoleum. This was a personal wish and command of the sultan. Sigismund and Katarina had converted to Islam while in Bosnia, so they were free people, not prisoners. Their acceptance of Islam was important for the sultan's decision to raise a mausoleum for Katarina as an aristocrat and Muslim. An acceptance of Muslim names was not a condition in their conversion. Epilogue The Muslims from Skopje visited her mausoleum and burnt candles there. The Sheiks of the Sersem Ali-Baba Tekke took care for the tomb. They believed that in the land of her ancestors was one of the seven graves (\\"Yedi tabut\\"), where the remnants of Sari Saltuk-Dede were buried. Prince Sigismund reached the title Bey in Istanbul and Karahisar. Historical sources record him as Ishak-Bey Kraljeviƒá (Kraloƒülu, literally son of the king), as he was the Sanjak Bey of the Karasi region. After a defeat at the Battle of Farsus (1488), he was captivated by Egyptians in the same time when Ahmed Pasha Hercegoviƒá was captured. He is not recorded in the historical sources after 1490, which is an indication that he has died shortly afterwards. He was buried in the Greek town of S√©rres near the Halvetian Tekke. Modern days Before it has been demolished in the 1963 earthquake, the mausoleum, with its harmonious architectural solution, dimensions and its aesthetic appearance, has given the location a unique ambience. According to its structure, it belongs to an open type of mausoleum with a square foundation made up of stone blocks. Four heart-shaped vaulted pillars were covered with bricks at the top. The four sided cupola of the mausoleum was covered with tiles. On the basis of the pillars, capitals and at the ending wreath there was a molding. Today this location is left to negligence and oblivion. Only the princess grave and the fundaments of the mausoleum are distinguishable. In these days, it has very few visitors and in recent times it has become a place where candles are burnt for the souls of the dead relatives and beloved ones. In the popular tradition, this place is considered to be cult. This asserts to the need of an urgent restoration of the ruins of the object, on which the new-old object shall be erected by using the stony remnants and other relatively preserved artifacts. The \\"Princess mausoleum\\" or the \\" King's Daughter mausoleum\\", or the \\"mausoleum of Bosnian princess Catherine\\" is listed among the oldest Islamic and oriental sacral objects. It has been mentioned as an Ottoman- Bosniak monument too. However, it bears a certain significance in the culture of North Macedonia and its history.

It features guest appearances from former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor, original Rolling Stones bassist and Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor and keyboardist Max Middleton. The album contains original material and covers of staple songs within the Blues genre. Covers include versions of Albert King's \\"As The Years Go Passing By\\", \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\" (most famously covered by Fleetwood Mac) and a re-interpretation of Robert Johnson's \\"Cross Road Blues\\" (covered by Cream). Speaking to Blues Matters Magazine, Petit addressed the potential controversy involved with re-working seminal, \\"sacred\\" blues recordings: > \\"These songs were dead. My so-called desecration [of the original versions] > was an act of love. I feel a wonderment and enchantment about these songs, > which is why I recorded them. If the blues is to grow and thrive it has to > evolve.\\"  Recording and production  Recording sessions for The Crave took place at Chapel Studios, Lincoln and 2 kHz Studios, London. The Crave was produced by Stephen Dale Petit and mixed by Jim Spencer (New Order, Johnny Marr, The Vaccines) and Ian Grimble (The Clash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Manic Street Preachers). Additional recording took place at British Grove Studios, Metropolis Studios, and The Smokehouse and at Petit's home studio. = Guest appearances = Former Rolling Stone Mick Taylor features on slide guitar on \\"Slide\\". Dick Taylor of The Pretty Things and formerly of The Rolling Stones plays bass on \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\". Keyboardist Max Middleton features on final track \\"Hole in My Soul\\". String arrangements for The Crave were orchestrated by Chris Elliot (Amy Winehouse, David Gray, Adele). Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood appears on album opener \\"3 Gunslingers\\" in the form of a pre- recorded answer phone message that features at the intro of the song, which was inspired by an evening in late 2009 which Petit spent with Wood and Eric Clapton driving around North London in Petit's car. The song's lyrics chronicle that evening.  Concept and influences  In keeping with his long- standing and well-publicised mission to incite a \\"New Blues Revolution\\", Petit has stated that his primary goal with the album was to \\"explore different ways of approaching and presenting the blues\\", and avoid re-creating stereotypes within the genre: \\"There are a lot of contemporary blues albums that adhere to predictable conventions: certain production values, arrangements, sonic cliches, stereotypical lyrical things and so on. I had zero interest in making an album like that‚Ä¶ I wanted the music coming out of the speakers to sound like it was, say, 1935 or 1954 or whenever and 2010 simultaneously.\\" The Crave was celebrated by critics for its musical diversity. Classic Rock magazine described the album as moving \\"from Gospel to Punk via several shades of Boogie\\". Petit stated that he intended The Crave' to serve as a wide-lens view of the Blues as a genre, demonstrating its presence in a wide variety of genres and demonstrating the widespread influence of the Blues on other genres. Speaking to Classic Rock Magazine about the album's re-interpretation of Tupac Shakur's hip-hop classic \\"California Love\\", Petit said: \\"The hypnotic riff in California [Love] was sampled from a Joe Cocker song called 'Woman to Woman'. That riff is Deep Blues. Blues is at the core of Tupac's song. If people can't hear that‚Ä¶ Well, you know, there were people in the 50s and 60s who said that electric blues, city blues, was not blues, thereby discounting the entire Chess Records catalogue.\\"  Artwork  The album sleeve features a vibrant, contemporary design. Petit wanted to present the album in a way that was visually exciting, avoiding the usual presentation cliches associated with the blues genre: \\"I wanted to push boundaries and get up [blues] purist's noses because if purists have it their way, the music goes nowhere. It just dies.\\" The cover was designed by award winning multi-media artist Oli Max. The remainder of the album's artwork and packaging were designed by Monosapien and Olimax.  Critical reception  The album marked an expansion of critical recognition from blues-centric publications into the mainstream press for Petit and his music. Upon the album's release, Petit was featured in The Times, MOJO, The Independent, The Sunday Times, Classic Rock and The Express, with the general consensus being that The Crave signalled his evolution and maturation as an artist. Blues Matters Magazine said: \\"[Petit] has expanded his playing, developed his songwriting and really delivered some fine numbers. His playing is dynamite, his vocals are exultant‚Ä¶ This is absolutely the most personal album that has been released this year and possibly the most important ‚Äì simply brilliant.\\" The album was listed in Classic Rock magazine's \\"50 Best Albums Of The Year\\". \\"Cali Guitar Hero starts Blues Renaissance\\" said MOJO Magazine, continuing that \\"The Crave puts the blues in a contemporary context.\\" The Times praised the album's \\"raw, fresh energy\\" and The Sunday Times Culture Magazine ran a lengthy feature on Petit and The Crave. The Sunday Mirror called Petit \\"a guitar sensation\\" and Time Out London labelled him a \\"new blues revolutionary\\". The Crave also received widespread positive reviews online. Loudhorizon.com wrote: \\"The Crave is a seventeen track masterpiece. This album should see Petit vie for King of the Blues title.\\" BRFM.com likened The Crave to seminal album London Calling by The Clash: \\"[The Crave is] Fabulous.

Written and produced by Harry Alan Towers,BFI.org the film follows a tribe of Amazonian women, as, led by their queen, they attack wealthy men as part of a long-term plan to take over the world. A co-production between West Germany, Spain and the United States, the film is a sequel to The Million Eyes of Sumuru (1967), and is based on Sax Rohmer's Sumuru character. Nevertheless, Sumaru's character is referred to as either \\"Sumitra\\" or \\"Sununda\\". Plot Secret agent Jeff Sutton arrives in Rio with $10 million and finds himself embroiled in a war between Sir Masius, a British mobster, and the megalomaniacal Sumuru. From her secret city, \\"Femina\\", Sumuru assembles an army of women with which she will conquer the world. Masius, hoping to find Femina and steal Sumuru's riches, tries to use Sutton as his pawn. Ultimately, Sutton leads a squadron of helicopters on an attack on Femina. Knowing that she is beaten, she chooses to destroy Femina rather than let Masius have its wealth. Sutton barely makes it out of Femina before it self-destructs, presumably killing both Sumuru and Masius. Nevertheless, the film concludes with Sumuru aboard a ship leaving Rio, joined by a group of women who are apparently her followers.

The origins of the neighborhood date from 1905, when I√±igo Noriega proposed urbanizing what was then called Colonia La Paz. Plans for the construction of housing subdivisions were approved by the city in 1907, forming streets and blocks, but it did not officially establish the administrative division of colonia. The project then stalled. In 1913, the Agr√≠cola y Colonizadora Mexicana Company proposed a similar project, but this, too, ran into problems. By 1920, there were houses and blocks but only semi-organized, with houses and other properties encroaching on other private properties and colonias. Colonia La Paz was a rather large area with eventually broke off into several smaller colonias. Paulino Navarro broke off by 1920 from the center of La Paz, which is now called Colonia Asturias. Around the same time, the first houses were built on the drying lakebed in this area, as well as the roads of Calzada de San Esteban, known today as Calzada del Chabacano and other major roads such as Eje 3 Jos√© Pe√≥n Contreras.

British Electric Traction subsidiary Western Welsh Omnibus Co took one in 1954, 40 in 1956 and six in 1958. Trinidad Bus Service had four in 1956 (the one pictured in the MCW official picture carries a Tiger Cub badge.) and John Fishwick & Sons took six in 1957. The 1954 show bus and prototype went to Jones, Aberbeeg whilst a single example was exported to Ceylon, the sole left hand drive example was sold to China in 1958, all 60 were single door. The Olympian for China not only differed from the other 59 in being left hand drive, it was fitted with a Pneumocylic semi-automatic gearbox. Initially finished in cream and orange, it made landfall at Hsinkang and was used by the Beijing authority on experimental suburban express routes. No further were purchased and it seems not to have influenced the direction of Chinese bus design. In his Classic Blunderbus column on the type in Classic Bus 63, the current Buses Magazine editor Alan Millar explained that it was a lightweight version of the Leyland-MCW Olympic, and as that used Leyland Royal Tiger or Royal Tiger Worldmaster components, so this used Leyland Tiger Cub units. The name Olympian was he says adopted because Olympic Cub would have sounded \\"plain daft\\"; that said Leyland coded the type HRC (or, for the sole left hand drive version, ELC) where HR or EL was a mnemonic for \\"Olympic\\" and C meant \\"Cub\\". Completed examples were only 3cwt lighter than Tiger Cub chassis with the same maker's body. In appearance there was little to tell them apart save that the Olympian was differently badged and had a water filler cap aperture mounted behind and slightly above the centre line of the nearside front wheel; The Tiger Cub's water filler cap was higher mounted and generally hidden by a sprung flap. With 60 built and six exported this was the least successful postwar Leyland single deck, none were built after the Chinese example even though Leyland Motors were still advertising its availability in a 1964 booklet. But Leyland kept hold of their registration of the name, and it came in handy for the Project B45 Leyland Olympian in 1980. LW was the bodybuilder's identity for the vehicle, it could have stood for Leyland Weymann, or Light Weight, probably the latter. One of the Fishwick buses is preserved.

History overview of Seddon/Seddon Atkinson bus production Seddon Diesel Vehicles were, like Atkinson Lorries, ERF and Motor Traction Ltd (Rutland), a commercial vehicle producer who bought-in and assembled proprietary components. Robert and Herbert Seddon were sons of a Salford butcher who in 1919 subsequent to World War I demobilisation bought a Commer with charabanc and van bodies, using it during the week for goods transport and at weekends to run excursions from Salford. Initially a further partner was a family-friend, a dairyman by the name of Foster, so the business was initially a partnership. Foster & Seddon also reconditioned vehicles and ran a bus service from Swinton (Lancs.) to Salford, which was subsequently sold to Salford Corporation, and held an agency for Morris Motors vehicles. In 1937 Robert Seddon spotted a gap in the commercial vehicle market for low-tare diesel-engined lorries and commenced to build his own vehicle out of proprietary units, much of the drawing work being done on his own kitchen table. This was a 6-ton gvw forward-control lorry chassis with a 6-cylinder Perkins indirect-injection diesel engine. It was first shown at the Scottish Motor show at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow in 1938. Like Maudslay and ERF, Seddon Motors Ltd were allowed to continue producing commercial vehicle chassis for sale during World War II when many more- established makers such as Leyland Motors, the Associated Equipment Company and direct-competitor Albion Motors had all of their productive capacity diverted to the war effort. In 1946 Seddon Motors Ltd moved to a former shadow factory in Oldham and were able to expand production from one or two a week to more than ten. At this point they introduced their first passenger chassis the Mark IV. The 26 ft mark IV and 27 ft 6in mark VI were sales successes at home and overseas. Coachbuilders for these chassis included Plaxton and a number of smaller concerns, Seddon also built their own coachwork for these models, mainly for export. Subsequently Seddon also produced (amongst a bewildering range for which Roman numbers were adopted when the firm became Seddon Diesel Vehicles Ltd in 1950) the Mark 7P. This was a short-wheelbase version of the established theme with four-cylinder Perkins engine and up to 28 seats available within a 21 ft overall length. At the 1952 Earls Court Commercial Motor show marks 10 and 11 featured vertical Perkins (P6 80 bhp or R6 107 bhp) engines mounted underfloor (when competing underfloor-engined buses used horizontally oriented engines). Although Bedford were to have success with such a layout between 1970 and 1987 the marks 10 and 11 sold poorly, with Seddon, Charles H. Roe, Duple and Plaxton bodies on the few known examples. The mid 1950s mark 16 was a 21 ft long bus with a Perkins P4 on the front overhang and the mark 17 was a six-cylinder-engined chassis to similar layout. The mark 18 of the late 1950s, mainly sold to Australia and New Zealand, with local coachwork. It had a vertically mounted Perkins P6 80 bhp engine on the rear overhang. There was also one mark 20 with a Henry Meadows 550 cubic inch horizontal rear-engine exported to Greece. The mark 23 was a front entrance front-engined bus for Kowloon Motor Bus and the mark 25P a normal control 18-seat personnel-carrier based on the mark 25 integral parcel van. The bodybuilding business, not only on Seddon and other manufacturer's buses but building lorry cabs and parcel vans for customers such as Manchester Corporation (who ran a parcel delivery service) was registered in its own right as Pennine Coachcraft Ltd (wholly owned by Seddon) in 1960. From 1966 (with mark numbers climbing into the high twenties), Seddon decided to simplify its nomenclature, wagons were henceforth to be identified as (for example) 16-4 with the first number being the gross vehicle weight and the second the number of wheels. Bus chassis were to be known as Seddon Pennine Mark (x). The first buses using this system produced were for Bermuda and were Seddon Pennine Mark 3, they are believed to be similar to a short-wheelbase Pennine Mark 4 but with Perkins P6 or 6-304 engines or an integral development of the Mark 17 model of similar layout. From the middle 1950s, Seddon had been almost absent on the home market for bus & coach concerns. A sole mark 19 using many AEC Reliance components in a Seddon-sourced frame with Harrington body being sold in 1960 to Creamline Coaches in Hampshire. But following the success of the Ford R-Series and the Bedford VAL and VAM, Seddon decided to make a similar product, to a variety of wheelbases with Perkins engines; as on the competitors, these were vertically mounted on the front platform. This was launched in 1967 as the Pennine 4, which thanks to vigorous marketing became a strong seller worldwide, the largest order being from Kowloon Motor Bus of Hong Kong, who took 100 11-metre versions with Perkins 170 bhp V8 engines and Pennine Coachcraft 47 seat + 42 standing dual-door bodies. A rear-engined derivative was the Mark 5 (only one sold in the UK, a 45-seat Van Hool coach) and a version with a turbocharged Perkins 6-cylinder engine mounted at the front but under the passenger floor was the Pennine 6. In 1969 a more concerted effort at the UK bus market resulted in the launch of the Pennine RU. In 1970, Seddon took over Atkinson Lorries to form Seddon Atkinson, in 1974 International Harvester bought Seddon Atkinson, later Pegaso took over the business until it in turn became part of Iveco, the last lorries under the Seddon Atkinson name were built in Oldham in 2004. Bus and coach production having ceased in 1983 when the last Pennine 7 models were delivered. RU description The Seddon Pennine RU (for rear-underfloor, the location of the engine) was launched in 1969 as a competitor in the market for rear-engine single deckers. Although a very different product to the Pennine 4 it followed the same market-driven philosophy. Viz: offer the same major features as the most in-demand model but cut out most of the complexity, some of the purchase price and offer it for sale quickly and cheaply with the choice of in-house Pennine Coachcraft bodywork. The market leader was in the rear-engine single- deck segment was the Bristol RE and Seddon decided to use similar mechanical units, notably Gardner engines and Self-Changing Gears semi-automatic transmission. Whereas the RE used a gently ramped frame on bus variants. Seddon decided to use a straight frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex drive-line arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the rear cross member on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, to a variety of different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with resilient rubber-based joints. Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further from the rear of the frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling wedge-type drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid- wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible fan drive was announced but this was never made available to customers. The Pennine Coachcraft body was a jig-built aluminium-framed structure similar to that of the standard body fitted to the Pennine 4. It was directly attached to the Pennine RU chassis frame, saving further cost and weight. Although this body was intended as the standard offering, other coachbuilders' products could be fitted. In the event three other makes of bodies were fitted to the RU, Plaxton used a steel-reinforced hardwood structure whilst East Lancashire Coachbuilders and Charles H. Roe both used steel-tube framing. The initial prototype TBU598G, registered in March 1969, carried a Pennine Coachcraft 41 seat dual-door body on the short-wheelbase version of the chassis and Seddon demonstrated it to a number of municipal and company fleets mainly in the Pennines, commencing its career in Halifax. The second prototype was to the 36 ft length with 45 seats and dual doors. It was exhibited at the 1970 Commercial Motor show at Earls Court in the livery of Crosville where it was overshadowed by the debuts of the Leyland National and the Metro-Scania; it was then registered ABU451J and served as a demonstrator across Great Britain. Initial list prices complete with body started at ¬£6,200 which was substantially cheaper than an equivalent ECW-bodied RE, lead times were very good because Seddon had expanded into adjacent premises in order to set up a dedicated bus-production facility. Furthermore, the RU was the first bus chassis designed to meet the requirements of the New Bus Grant announced in the Transport Act 1968. This government grant initially covered 25% of the first cost of grant-compliant buses used on local bus services, from 1971 this was increased to 50%. By the end of 1970 a further 46 chassis had been built, bodied and delivered. Production then rose to a peak of 109 (including the second prototype) in 1971, dropping back slightly in 1972 to 99 then only 13 were delivered in 1973 and six in 1974, so 76% of chassis were built in two years, the municipal market was moving back toward double decks and the rival Leyland National was outselling every other single-deck bus. Production ceased in March 1974 after 274 were completed, the last chassis numerically were numbers 56041/2 which were ordered by Huddersfield and delivered to West Yorkshire PTE in September and October 1974 respectively (registered PVH 452/453M). Customers From 1966-9 Pennine had bodied increasing numbers of rear-engined single deck buses, and by the time body production ended in 1975 they had, besides the RU, bodied AEC Swifts, Daimler Fleetlines, Leyland Atlanteans and Leyland Panthers, but the largest number of home-market Pennine bodies on third-party chassis had gone on Bristol RELL and RESL, with Reading Corporation being the largest customer with 28 bodies to its own outline on a short-wheelbase version of the RELL. The majority of customers for the RU also took the Pennine body. This was fitted to 69% of RU production (23% carried Plaxton bodies with 4% shares for both East Lancashire and Roe). It sold best in Cheshire (37%, all Crosville), Lancashire (36%, spread between one PTE, one independent, and six corporations, total also including both demonstrators) and Yorkshire (22% over one PTE, one independent and four corporations), the first customer to take delivery was Doncaster Corporation who took their first fourteen in the early months of 1970 Huddersfield Corporation also had short, dual-door versions in service with H registrations (thus registered prior to 1 August 1970), Lancashire United were the third customer to get H-registration examples, their first twenty. Huddersfield were to take 22 and Doncaster 25. Other municipal customers included Accrington Corporation (5), Blackburn Corporation (6), Halifax Joint Omnibus Committee (3), Burnley, Colne and Nelson JOC (20), Darlington Corporation (8), Lytham St Annes (6), Morecambe Corporation (6), Rotherham Corporation (9) and Southampton Corporation (5). Accrington and Blackburn took East Lancashire bodies on theirs, Halifax and Rotherham chose Plaxton Derwent II bodies as did Huddersfield for its final two and the rest took the Pennine Coachcraft option. The final 11 for Doncaster were the only ones with Charles H Roe bodies. Due to central government legislation English and Welsh county and borough council boundaries were changed and from 1974 metropolitan counties were created in England in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. Most of the metropolitan areas already had passenger transport executives but these were established in the two metropolitan Yorkshire counties (which together comprised the majority of the historic West Riding) thus South Yorkshire absorbed the Rotherham and Doncaster RU's and West Yorkshire the Halifax/Calderdale and Huddersfield vehicles. Outside the metropolitan counties, local government changes caused some fleets to merge (e.g. Lancaster with Morecambe & Heysham, Blackburn with Darwen) while others were renamed, Burnley, Colne and Nelson becoming Burnley & Pendle and Accrington changing title to Hyndburn. Independent customers for the RU were headed by Lancashire United Transport (LUT) of Atherton who took delivery of fifty over 1970-1. These had a special version of the Plaxton Derwent II body supplied only to this operator featuring flat rather than curved windscreens, deleting peaks on front and rear domes and having glazing and general appearance similar to Plaxton's previous (1958‚Äì66) Highway bus body. They also appear (judging by photographic evidence) to have had front- mounted radiators. As well as being fitted to the fifty RU which were dual- door 40-seaters on short chassis, the same body went on two batches of Bristol RESL6G, twenty B42D in 1967/8 and ten DP41F in 1973/4. Subsequently LUT (and other outliers such as the Calderdale Region of West Yorkshire PTE) were prevailed upon to take the standard version of the Derwent II. Other independent customers for the RU took the Pennine body, all in long single- door form with 51 bus seats; these were Garelochhead Coach Services (1), Dodds (AA Service) Troon (2), Grahams Bus Service of Paisley (1), and Reliance of Sutton on the Forest, North Yorkshire (2). When the second National Bus Company order table was published on 30 July 1970 tabulating orders for subsidiaries in 1971 the biggest surprises were two orders each calling for 100 single-deck buses. Midland Red (whose last home-built BMMO bus had just been delivered) ordered 100 Ford R192 with 45-seat Plaxton Derwent II bodies whilst Crosville ordered 100 Seddon Pennine RU complete with Pennine Coachcraft bodies. Arguably the Crosville order was more surprising as, apart from a pair of Commer/Harrington minibuses in 1964, Crosville had exclusively ordered Bristol chassis and Eastern Coach Works bodies for its bus fleet from 1950. Crosville's Pennine RU were all to 36 ft length, the order broke into two sub-batches of fifty, half were single door with 47 coach seats for long limited-stop journeys and half were 45 seat dual-door buses for intensive urban operations. Crosville had taken the last of its 593 Bristol Lodekkas in 1968 and was concentrating on renewing its single-deck fleet, which at the time still included a few half-cab Bristol L-types, it did not order its first VRs until 1972. It ordered 288 REs between 1964 and 1973, calling for them in every year but 1970. Seddon started delivering this (joint) record order for complete buses in April 1971 with 46 delivered with J plates (i.e. prior to August) and completed it just over a year later in May 1972, a creditable performance for a new factory unit which was also engaged in a batch of 100 Perkins V8-engined Pennine 4 for Kowloon Motor Bus and a large number of smaller orders, as well as converting double-deck buses to dual-door for such undertakings as Merseyside PTE and Nottingham City Transport. The final RU to be delivered to a new customer was equipped with a Chloride sponsored battery- electric driveline and was called the \\"Silent Rider\\". It was sold to SELNEC (later Greater Manchester) PTE who numbered it EX61 in its experimental series, registering it XVU387M. The Chloride battery pack weighed four tonnes and the vehicle (unladen but for those batteries) weighed 13 tonnes (almost double the unladen weight of the Gardner-powered version) so payload was limited, by the axles fitted, to one tonne which equalled a capacity of B41D + 9 standing and although it featured regenerative braking the bus (like Lucas battery-electric Seddon Midi EX62 XVU364M which followed in 1975) was not a success. The Silent Rider project alone cost ¬£100,000 at mid-1970s values, promotional tours to Sheffield and Chicago, Illinois, United States may have been prestigious for the Executive and for the manufacturers of vehicle and batteries, who were both major employers of voters in the PTE area, but Cook County Transit and the South Yorkshire PTE were, lacking the electrical- charging and cell-care infrastructure installed in a Manchester garage as part of the project, able to get even less use out of the thing than Greater Manchester who tried to employ its advertised 100-mile range by using it sporadically on one morning and one afternoon peak-time journey on routes 202/3. It was out of service by 1976. In service Although conceived as a bus chassis, a surprising number were used for interurban services, among these were the three ordered by GG Hillditch for the Halifax JOC. These (315-317, MJX15-17J) carried Plaxton Derwent II bodies with 45 full-coach seats on a flat floor with a three-step entrance to the front platform and then a further transverse step into the saloon, thus the entrance was more like a Bristol RELH than an RESL. Styling on these three was to Mr Hillditch's standard single-deck outline of the time with a large projecting two-line destination indicator above the BET-style double curvature screen, This large and legible advertisement projected from a rounded front dome, with a similar rounded rear-end. These were specified for limited-stop 'trans-pennine' services and in the year after delivery became the 'top-shed' buses for Calderdale JOC (which was a merger in 1971 of Halifax, Todmorden and National Bus Company interests.) route 8 from Leeds via Halifax and Todmorden to Burnley. These were replaced on this front-line work after a year, being succeeded by similar-looking AEC Reliances which in their turn gave way to similar-looking Leyland Leopards. When West Yorkshire PTE was formed all three Calderdale RU were moved to Huddersfield, concentrating the fleet's collection of the type in one place. The single-door half of the Crosville batch were initially allocated to long distance Anglo-Welsh services. Numbers of other RUs though used on bus services were fitted either with Seddon's design of individual semi-coach seat, as on the 47-seat Crosville examples, or other designs of luxury seats, whilst some of the Huddersfield ones were delivered seatless and had Roe coach seats removed from AEC Regals absorbed with the takeover of Hanson buses fitted at the Huddersfield works prior to entry into service, this re-using of seats and internal fittings was something of a Huddersfield trait, throughout its existence, sometimes it got entire bodies re-chassied. Only one RU was fitted with a luxury-coach body however, this was ordered by Accrington and delivered to Hyndburn as its 38 (STC986M). This carried one of the three East Lancashire 'Lancastrian' coach bodies built, the only one to 10-metre length. It was an ungainly vehicle with a high ramped floor, carrying 39 Plaxton seats, all forward-facing, Large curved side screens were used on the four main-bays, of a type used on contemporary Mercedes-Benz and Neoplan coaches leading to a parabolic roof contour, but aft of the rear axle flat Willowbrook-pattern bus glazing was used, offside and nearside emergency doors were fitted. A wide two-leaf entry/exit door was fitted forward of the front axle to ensure grant-compliance, and the front was basically flat with a very large angled flat-glass windscreen surmounted by a peak reminiscent of a British Rail 'Western' diesel-hydraulic locomotive. Luggage was contained in underfloor wheelbase lockers as in contemporary Bristol RE coaches. It spent a quiet life, working peak hour extras and select coach hires. It seems an irony that two early Harrington Cavaliers were exclusively to transport the blind yet this coach, finished in navy blue with scarlet flashes, was able to assault the senses of the sighted for one of the longer operational lives of its type, actually outlasting the two similar bodies Widnes/Halton had on Leopards. Hyndburn 38 may have been an aesthetic disaster, but it was not: unlike most RU, a mechanical one (see later). The RU was intended as a municipal bus, and 42% went to Corporation bus fleets, NBC (the Crosville order) took 36%, and independents, mainly Lancashire United accounted for 20%. The other buses were the two demonstrators and three delivered to PTEs. The formation of the West Yorkshire PTE gave them an instant fleet of 24 with two on delivery, South Yorkshire PTE inherited 34 with the Doncaster and Rotherham Fleets, and upon purchasing Lancashire United on 1 January 1976 Greater Manchester Transport found its fleet of RU climbing from one to fifty-one. The strangest case of all was that of the original demonstrator which went to Green Bus Service of Rugeley from 1971 until 1974 when Midland Red took them over. Midland Red sold it to a dealer and it was purchased for the enlarged Lancaster operation. Thus out of the four sectors purchasing RU, this bus served in three of them and briefly gave NBC a second RU operator. Problems in operation Drivers generally found handling on Seddon RUs vague, and steering imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and king pins were less durable than they should have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough. The steering box mountings also needed to be reinforced. Radiator mountings were also initially inadequate and had to be strengthened. The air cleaner was located aft of the nearside rear wheel and although this was hard to reach had to be attended-to regularly if engine performance was not to suffer. The main battery switch was also located in a position where it was vulnerable to road splash and had to be shielded, some of the wiring was also 'suspect' sometimes causing fires. and had to be re- routed The brakes were unfamiliar to bus engineers who were used to cam- operated brakes and drivers complained that the buses could not pull-up in a straight line. In the Classic Bus reader poll for the worst bus of all time the RU failed to make the top ten but J. Whiteing summarises the type thus: 'Provided they started they would run and run, but stopping was a case for hope and prayer.' The Pennine bodies were found to be rather too light and tended to crack around the chassis mounting points, whilst the dual-door versions also had localised fractures around the centre exit door. Jim Sambrooks of Doncaster Corporation and South Yorkshire PTE recalled a Doncaster engineering foreman saying \\"If it's a Seddon it's a dead 'un.\\" Again referring to the unlikelihood of pulling up in a straight line, he also recalled the first batch had car-type handbrake levers which disintegrated in use; later upon becoming a fitter he discovered that the brake adjusters (of two different sorts on the different batches) were virtually inaccessible, that spring shackle-pins often needed to be knocked out which was equally difficult, that topping up the fluid flywheel was \\"nigh-on impossible\\" and only done when a bus developed gearbox-slip, and that in order to remove the engines for overhaul, Doncaster engineers actually had to cut-away the rear cross member and bolt in a removable piece of girder once they had done. Problems on the Doncaster Pennine bodies included rivets falling out and frame-fractures above the exit door. John S Hinchliffe singles out Huddersfield no 45 (XCX245J) as \\"the only one that stopped in a straight line, was smooth to drive, had positive steering and gave a smooth ride\\". Even though, as pictured, the offside fog lamp of this bus is missing and there is a prominent fracture-line in adjacent regions of the front fibreglass panel. Huddersfield's 21 Pennines were all built as dual-door vehicles but were converted by the manufacturer to single-door, in the case of 51 after only nine months in service, while this was done Huddersfield were lent a fully automatic Pennine VI Interurban demonstrator, which they used on service to Oldham. Mr Hinchliffe sums up his experience of the type by saying they were 'reliable' but 'not popular due to their inability to hold the road'. However the insuperable problem was the proximity of the engine to the rear axle, and on 33 ft versions many different designs of drive-shaft were employed but no effective way was found of insulating the engine and gearbox from road shocks. Crosville had all of its 36 ft models converted with a revised engine and gearbox mounting closer to the rear cross member, allowing a longer universal- jointed drive shaft to be put in place, this arrangement was also applied to later long-wheelbase RU as built. To cover for vehicles being modified, Seddon Atkinson lent Crosville the prototype Pennine 7 (UBU72N), which remained with Crosville after the work was done. Unlike their Bristol REs which were cascaded to more remote parts of the company's North Wales hinterland as newer replacements arrived, Crosville's Seddons were generally kept close to the central works at Chester. Crosville did allocate some dual-purpose RU to its South Cambrian division in 1975 but they were not popular, finding themselves allocated to non-service work including swimming bath contracts before they were returned across the border in 1976. By 1981 Crosville had started to fit some 6HLX engines from Seddons it had withdrawn on expiry of their certificates of initial fitness into its Mark 1 Leyland Nationals. The Garelochhead bus, 106 (CSN716K) a single-door 51-seater was the company's first 11m vehicle and was bought in July 1972 for its Helensburgh town service. It was sold in late 1977 to Dodds for spares and, its career described as 'troubled', was reported in process of being scrapped by January 1978. Rotherham's nine 44-seat Plaxton Derwents were its last single deckers, they entered service in late 1972, replacing 1963 AEC Reliances, and were withdrawn by SYPTE on expiry of their certificates of initial fitness. Glynne S Pegg recalled two of them failing him on journeys to work in the same week. In retrospect, later copies by Ward Brothers and Dennis Lest it be thought the RU was unpopular with everyone, the late batch of eight 11-metre versions supplied to Darlington Transport were well liked by the operator and they tried to commission more from Seddon Atkinson after the end of production, this was not to be and Darlington (whose other single-decks were then Daimler Roadliners and Daimler Fleetlines) instead bought four dual-door Leyland Leopards in 1977, their next two new vehicle orders went to Dennis for single deck Marshall-bodied Dominators, then in 1983 they got Ward Motors Ltd to build them six RU-like vehicles called the GRXI (for Gardner, Rear-engine 11 metres. This latter in Roman numerals). These differed from the RU only in having 180 bhp Gardner 6HLXB engines, ZF power steering and Wadham Stringer Vanguard B45D bodies, a further six were optioned, but the Ward Brothers' company went bankrupt before these could be built. And, despite its ugly- duckling appearance, Hyndburn 38 was one of the longer-lived examples of the breed; it and its more bus-like batch-mates enduring in service until 1984 when they were replaced by the only short-wheelbase examples of the Dennis Falcon HC, which derived some of its features from the Bristol RE, but unlike the earlier Falcon H had a driveline closely resembling that of the Pennine RU. The direct replacement for number 38, the coach seated example, was recently reported to still be working on Malta. The last RU to run as a PSV is understood to have been new to Lytham St. Annes STJ847L which was withdrawn by East End Coaches, Clydach in South Wales in late 2000. East End bought several RUs between 1980 and 1991 from Burnley, Fylde and Darlington. In 1997 it still operated Fylde STJ847/50L, Darlington WHN462/3/8M and had WHN466/7M and RHG314K as spares donors. A fire in 1999 destroyed WHN463/6/7M and damaged STJ850L and only STJ847L continued in use. Both Fylde ones, WHN462/8M and RHG314K were disposed of in spring 2001, STJ847L for preservation, the remainder for scrap.http://fyldebus.blogspot.com/2009/09/seddon-ru.html Survivors As far as is known, only 2 Seddon Pennine RUs survive: both in preservation, these being former Lytham St. Annes /Fylde Borough Transport 47 STJ847L (Lancastrian Transport Trust) and Southampton Corporation 15 BCR379K (Southampton & District Transport Heritage Trust). Although the \\"Silent Rider\\", was stored for the Greater Manchester Museum of Transport it was vandalised and found to be beyond economic restoration and reluctantly scrapped. Even more tellingly, Seddon itself is long-gone and of the twenty operators who took the Seddon Pennine RU new, only one, Reliance of the North Riding survives in a recognisable form.

The core focus of SYPO is microfinance, through its Ugandan subsidiary SYPO Uganda Ltd. The main achievement of SYPO has been to develop a business model to reach women in very remote areas with low-cost business loans, relying on \\"lean\\" principles, mobile money and online technology systems. SYPO's Director is Duko Hopman, supervised by a board which is chaired by Ger van der Bruggen.SYPO's organisational structure  History  SYPO was started in 2003 to help partner organisation Pat the Child initiate the 'Yoghurt Project'. In this project, pregnant Friesian cows were donated to local women who were willing but financially unable to adopt local orphans. In the same project SYPO enabled Pat the Child to start a yoghurt factory which created a local market for the cows' milk and revenues for the NGO Pat the Child. The yoghurt is sold under the name Life Dairy throughout the Mukono District. After completion of this first project in 2007, SYPO decided to continue its operations, starting new projects aimed at entrepreneurship and economic development.SYPO's history  Projects  After the Yoghurt Project (see above), SYPO started a grassroot medical project called 'MediStructures', and a microfinance project through its subsidiary SYPO Uganda Ltd. SYPO microdevelopment provides business loans to thousands of solidarity lending groups of women in rural areas of Mukono District. The project employs loan officers to visit the clients for weekly repayments, through a network of flexible, low-cost field offices. All SYPO's projects were initiated in cooperation with local partner organisations, in charge of the daily management of the projects. In 2009, SYPO started the hotel Besaniya in Mukono town as an income generating project.Besaniya Guesthouse This hotel, aimed at European volunteers working in Mukono town, was sold to the Dutch NGO ICUganda in August 2010. SYPO focuses mainly on its microfinance project, and will continue to guide and control this project in the coming years.

Only the tower survived to the present day, and it is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The tower is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, History Construction of the tower began in the late 11th century. The church was initially a chapel of St Oswald's Priory in Gloucester. The nave and south porch of the church were in Norman style, and the chancel was Early English. A third stage was added to the tower in the 14th century. In 1678 a south chapel was demolished, and the following year the south wall of the chancel was rebuilt and two new windows were added. A major restoration was carried out in 1875 by Medland and Son. This consisted of demolishing all the church except for the tower, rebuilding it on its original footings, and adding an organ chamber and vestry on the north side of the chancel. The fabric of the building deteriorated during the 20th century, and by 1970 there were holes in the roof. It was declared redundant in 1972, and the body of the church was demolished in 1975, leaving only the tower. The tower was restored the following year. It had been vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 6 September 1974. Architecture The tower is constructed in lias rubble with a stone slate roof. It is in three stages, and it has a pyramidal roof with an iron cross on its apex. In the bottom stage is a round-headed doorway on the east side and a narrow round- headed lancet window on the west. The middle stage has a lancet window on the south face. In the top stage are wider trefoil-headed bell openings containing stone louvres.

Etymology  = Jackaroo = The word jackaroo, also formerly spelled jackeroo, has been used in Australia since at least the middle of the 19th century and passed from there into common usage in New Zealand. Its use in both countries continues into the 21st century. The origin of the word is obscure and probably unknowable, but its first documented use was in Queensland. Several possibilities have been put forward: *A deverbal noun which became a common noun through frequent occupational usage; derived from the practice of roasting a kangaroo on a spit. A \\"jack\\" being a person who turned meat on a spit or rotisserie. To \\"jack a 'roo\\" was to turn a kangaroo on a spit, a very common practice among rural workers in remote parts of Australia since colonial times. *An Australian variation on the term for American cowboys, who were sometimes called 'buckaroos'. The term 'buckaroo' was derived from the Spanish word 'vaquero'.cowboy#Etymology and usage *An origin from an indigenous language term for 'a wandering white man'. *Another suggestion (1895)A. Meston, Geographic History of Queensland, 1895 was for an origin from an Aboriginal word for a pied currawong, a garrulous bird, which the strange- sounding language of the white settlers reminded them of. Meston explained his position in a newspaper in 1919.1919 'Our Jackeroo Magpies.', The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864‚Äì1933), 12 November, p. 6, viewed 17 November 2010, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20392717 *By 1906, Immigrants into Australia were often called Johnny Raws. From that it became Jacky Raw.(1906 Bulletin (Sydney) 28 June 14/2) retrieved from The Australian National Dictionary, 17 November 2010 *By 1925, it was said that the term jackeroo originated from the fact that \\"one of the earliest [...] was named 'Jack Carew'.\\"(1925 Aussie (Sydney) April. 52/3) The Australian National Dictionary, 17 November 2010 *A 'Jack of all Trades in Australia' (Jack + kangaroo), has much popular support. The Brisbane Courier newspaper, of Queensland, on 5 July 1929, page 16, stated in answer to a question from a reader 'POMMY' of Toowong: *The Encyclopaedia of Australia stated in 1968 that it is \\"most probably a coined Australian- sounding word based on a [person] 'Jacky Raw'\\"1968, Encyclopaedia of Australia, A.T.A. and A.M. Learmonth, Frederick Warne & Co. Ltd, London and New York Jackaroos (Jacky + Raw) were often young men from Britain or from city backgrounds in Australia, which would explain the pejorative use of 'raw' in the sense of 'inexperienced'. *Arguably the most authoritative voice in 2010 was that of the Australian National Dictionary Centre of the Research School of the Humanities at the Australian National University, which provides Oxford University Press with editorial expertise for their Australian dictionaries. They have explained their reasons for making no final judgment, and raise another possibility, that 'jackeroo' is derived from an aboriginal word for 'stranger' rather than for a 'pied crow shrike'. * The spellings jackaroo and jackeroo were both used from about 1850 to at least 1981. In 2010, the more commonly used spelling was 'jackaroo'. However, between the years 1970 and 1981, a sample of Australian newspapers referred to 'jackeroo' 18 times and 'jackaroo' 29 times.TROVE database of digitised publications, Australian National Library, retrieved 12 June 2011http://trove.nla.gov.au/ = Jillaroo = The word jillaroo for a female landworker was coined in the Second World War1968, Encyclopaedia of Australia, Learmonth and persisted into the 21st century. During the war it was necessary for women to take on all the occupations followed traditionally only by men. Jillaroos were the female equivalent of jackeroos. Jack and Jill was a widely known nursery rhyme at that time, and suggests the derivation of Jillaroo from Jackaroo.

Okambonde A is on the right side of the road and Okambond B is on the left side of the road. Both parts are administered by one headman, Thomas Amuthenu. There are approximately 75 homesteads with an average of 6 people per homestead. Homes are made of tree poles cut from the surrounding forest. Due to the high growth rate, suitable trees are becoming scarce and the forest is slowly disappearing. Alternative building materials such as bricks, mud, thatch, and mesh wire are now being used to construct homes. Okambonde has rich fertile soil, and the economy is based on agriculture. Farming activities include mahangu cultivation, and herding cattle, goats, and donkeys. Poor rainfall means raising sheep or horses is difficult, but they are found in very low quantities. The community has one kindergarten, one primary school, one combined school and no high school. They have one soccer field, one volleyball field, and one netball court.

Concerned about the operating expenses of the then current aquatics facilities and pools, Rollins believed the county government could build a water park that would become a self-sustaining endeavor covering its operating expenses. The plan was included as part of a Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) referendum in 2002. The $4.5 million waterpark opened in 2004. In the first summer of operation, 90,000 people visited the park, exceeding initial estimates and expectations. In 2009, Splash in the Boro added a $4 million expansion, including additional attractions and park amenities. Attractions The park has a number of water environments. Included within the park is an pool that simulates a river and encircles the play and leisure pools. The park also contains 25-meter lane pool and a heated therapy pool.

History The first distillery to use the name \\"Ben Wyvis\\" operated between 1879 and 1926 in Dingwall (just south along what is now the A862 roadNLS). It was founded by D. G. Ross, but was then sold to Scotch Whisky Distillers in 1887. When Scotch Whisky Distillers was liquidated, the Ben Wyvis distillery was sold to the Ferintosh Distillery Co. Ltd., which was owned by Kirker, Greer & Co. in Belfast. The name was then changed to \\"Ferintosh\\". As of 2010, no whisky from this distillery is known to exist. A residential development on the original site is \\"Wyvis House\\". The Ben Wyvis distillery that began operation in 1965 was started by the Invergordon distillery, and was built on the Invergordon grain distillery complex. It was intended primarily to produce whisky for use in Invergordon blends, but did produce a very small number of single malts. When Ben Wyvis was dismantled in 1977, the stills were saved and eventually used by the Glengyle distillery. Single malts Legitimate single malt bottlings from the distillery's 1965-1977 operation are exceptionally rare. Years after the distillery had closed, Invergordon offered a single malt under the \\"Ben Wyvis\\" name, but for a retail price approximately ¬£20. This led to at least one incident where such a bottle was placed in an auction with estimates meant to imply that it was an original Ben Wyvis single malt: on 28 March 2007, McTear's Auctioneers offered Lot 166 (a 10-year-old Ben Wyvis) with an estimated value of ¬£400-¬£600, and the auction closed with a sale price of ¬£360.

It compiled a segment of the second volume of the DC Comics Wonder Woman comic book from issues 94 through 100 into a collected book edition. Storyline =A new Wonder Woman= After winning a contest to see who will become the new Wonder Woman in \\"Man's World\\", the Amazon Artemis makes her debut to the public. Still upset and confused by the whole ordeal, the original Wonder Woman (Diana) dons a new black outfit and returns to her life in America. Although Artemis tried diligently to distinguish herself from her predecessor in both New York City and Boston, this proved to be rather hard to do. Her approach to various situations were often seen as more violent than beneficial. Because of this, and due to Man's World's respect of Diana, Artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help, extending even to her brief time in the Justice League.Justice League America #97, 98, & 100 Superman once commented to Diana that Batman refused to allow Artemis to sit in Diana's chair during Justice League meetings.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #226 Diana's twin sister Donna Troy even showed resentment toward Artemis carrying the Wonder Woman title, which caused their first meeting to escalate into a heated argument.Guy Gardner Warrior #29 (March 1995) Because of this unwelcome reception, Artemis began to see Diana as a rival of sorts and would often harass and belittle Diana in public. Diana continued to use her abilities to help the citizens of Boston. Because of this the White Magician still viewed Diana as a threat. He helped increase the rivalry between two of Boston's mafia families, led by Paulie Longo and Antonio Sazia's widow Julianna Sazia respectively, in order to keep Diana preoccupied while he planned his next course of action to take over the city of Boston. Unfortunately for him Artemis continued Diana's investigation of him in her place. This caused Diana's involvement with the mafia rivalry to become unnecessary to him. Artemis later met a representative from a public relations company who agreed to help Artemis with her public likeability. What Artemis wasn't aware of was that the company, with the help of the White Magician, had set up several battles for her with superhuman men. However, she ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and abused women.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #98 Once she uncovered this truth she set about to prove herself by single-handedly taking down Boston's biggest mob boss: Julianna Sazia. Unable to capture Julianna, Artemis destroyed her army of robots and Sazia's booby- trapped mansion. When the White Magician became aware that Artemis was going to battle him, he used the life force of two women: his lover, anchor woman Cassandra Arnold and that of The Cheetah, to transform himself into a giant demon, capable of defeating the Amazon. In the process the remains of his two victims became super, savage demons with extraordinary power, and obeying only The White Magician's commands. Overwhelmed, Artemis kept up the fight valiantly until Diana was able to aid her, thanks to a disguised Circe teleporting her to her side. During the fight Circe attempted to use her magics on the demon, but the sorcery failed, as she was tied to her false mortal identity of Donna Milton. Using the last of her power, Circe teleported the two lesser demons and herself away, leaving Diana and Artemis to battle The White Magician alone. Near death, Artemis gave the Gauntlet of Atlas (which gave its wearer 10 times their normal strength) to Diana to finish the battle. Diana beat the demonic White Magician to within an inch of his life with her tremendously enhanced strength. However, before she could finish him, he was consumed by his own demonic powers and incinerated, leaving only a pile of smoldering ashes behind. While Circe and the Cheetah eventually returned to their former selves, Cassandra Arnold has not been seen since and her whereabouts remain unknown.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #100 Once the battle was over Diana went to Artemis' side and told her she battled as a true Wonder Woman. Before dying Artemis told Diana to take back her title as Wonder Woman, which she did.

The first floor otherwise houses a large dining room with kitchen area, and the second floor houses an auditorium with stage. The hall was built in 1879 as a community project under the direction of John James Temple, a local carpenter. It was built for the East Eddington Farmers' Club, a local organization at which farmers could meet and discuss agricultural practices that had been established in 1876. The club formed a separate organization, the East Eddington Public Hall Company, to actually own the building and manage its operations. This company operated the building until 1983, when it was taken over by the Eddington-Clifton Civic Center, and renamed Comins Hall in honor of a local family whose members were involved in many local civic affairs. The building was used, since its construction, as a polling place and site for town meetings, serving as the exclusive site of the latter between 1936 and the 1970s. It has hosted all manner of local community groups, including the local Grange chapter, generally at no charge, and has, since the construction of the stage addition in 1911, also hosted traveling theatrical shows and performers.

He has been identified as one of the 100 most important leaders in librarianship by the journal American Libraries.Kniffel, Sullivan & McCormick 1999, p. 44 In a career spanning over 75 years, he worked in various roles at the New York Public Library and served as the director of the Harvard University library system. He was known for his expertise in planning and designing research libraries.  Early life and education  Keyes Metcalf was born on April 13, 1889 in Elyria, Ohio, the son of Issacs Stevens Metcalf and Harriet Metcalf. Both of his parents died when he was very young and his sister, Marion, raised him.Metcalf 1980, p. 2 Among the values he learned growing up was an important emphasis on education. It was expected that he would, at least, earn an undergraduate degree.Metcalf 1980, p. 3 Growing up, his sister put together a family newsletter, and everyone was expected to contribute. Metcalf's love of reading resulted in his contributions often being reviews of books he was reading.Metcalf 1980, p. 19 Metcalf's experience in libraries began when he was thirteen years old, when he worked for at the Oberlin College library. His brother-in-law, Azariah Root, was the librarian. Here, he was taught how to organize the shelves and process new orders that came to the library. Despite being promised pay at five cents an hour, Metcalf was never paid for his efforts. He says about this oversight, \\"I'm inclined to believe that absent-mindedness on my employer's part, rather than poor work on mine, was why I was never paid... but I never ventured to complain.\\"Metcalf 1980, p. 23 Regardless of why he wasn't paid, Metcalf greatly enjoyed what he did and he knew he had found his life's work in librarianship. After graduating high school, Metcalf attended Oberlin, once again working in the library under Root's tutelage. It was during this period that Metcalf assisted in the opening of a new library at Oberlin, an experience that would help him later in life as he planned new libraries at Harvard. After the facility was completed, Metcalf was charged with coordinating the move of the stacks to the new building. While moving books into the library, Metcalf acted as the building's security guard, setting up an elaborate system of stacked books in strategic locations to detect intruders.Metcalf 1980, pp. 57‚Äì60 After graduating in 1911, Metcalf was accepted into the New York Public Library's Library School. He graduated from the school in 1915.Kaser 1993, p. 568  Career  =New York Public Library= While still in the library school, he began working in the stacks of the New York Public Library. This began a relationship that would last for over a quarter of a century. While working at the library, he served in many capacities, including the Chief of Stacks for three years Metcalf 1980, p. 142 and Assistant to the Director starting in 1919.Metcalf 1980, p. 194 Ultimately, in 1928 Metcalf was appointed Chief of the Reference Department. This was a position he would hold for the next ten years.Kaser 1993 p. 568 While at the New York Public Library, he became interested in the use of technology in the library, when he expanded the use of the first photostat machine to the library in 1912.Metcalf 1980, p. 163 This innovation made the copying of documents significantly easier. He also introduced a microfilm system to the library. His goal here was primarily to save certain books from damage from heavy use. (Metcalf 1980: 279) Metcalf considered these contributions to be the things he was most proud of in his years at the New York Public Library.Adamonis 1979, p. 23 =Harvard University= In 1937, Metcalf was appointed Director of University Libraries at Harvard. His tenure at Harvard was where he made a significant impact to librarianship. Early on, he encountered a problem that would face many libraries ‚Äì a lack of adequate space. Widener Library, the university's main library, would run out of space in a few years. In addition, the collection was so immense and the catalog so complex, it was often difficult to find materials. Metcalf recalled stories of students who were proud of the fact that they never had to use the library.Metcalf 1988, p. 27 Metcalf's mandate was to design a system that would meet the space needs of the library until the end of the twentieth century.Adamonis 1979, p. 23 The plan he came up with in 1938 was what he called ‚Äúcoordinated decentralization.‚Äù Metcalf 1988, p. 26 While recognizing that decentralizing library services wasn't the ideal solution, he also realized that Harvard, with 76 individual collections or facilities, already was very decentralized. He became convinced that students could be well served by separate libraries, as long as each building was organized around a single topic or, in some cases, audience. To realize this plan, he proposed the construction of new facilities, including the Houghton Library for rare books in 1942, and the Lamont Library, a library designed for the needs of undergraduates in 1949. The construction of Lamont succeeded in addressing a major complaint of the university's undergraduate population ‚Äì they couldn't easily find materials in Widener because of the sheer volume, or they would find that some materials were reserved for graduate students and inaccessible to undergraduates. He also expanded interlibrary cooperatives. Besides building new facilities, he also proposed splitting up Widener's collection to libraries focused on the subject matter of the material.Metcalf 1988, pp. 24‚Äì30 When planning these new facilities, Metcalf was concerned about the security of the collection ‚Äì damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood.Metcalf 1988, p. 71 In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of shut-off valves, and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels.Metcalf 1988, pp. 77‚Äì78 It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe. Metcalf's experience at Harvard made him and his staff experts in the problems that were facing many research libraries at the time. Metcalf was often called on to consult with other libraries. Harvard became the benchmark for solutions to these problems. Metcalf consulted on the libraries for the Army and Navy,Metcalf 1988, p. 186 and in 1942 was asked to chair a study of the University of Illinois Library School.Metcalf 1988, p. 253 During this time, Metcalf was also active in the American Library Association. He served as its president in 1942 and 1943.Kaser 1993, p. 569 His participation in the ALA may have contributed to Metcalf being among the first of Harvard's staff to be targeted by Senator Joseph McCarthy in his search for communists. As chair of the ALA's International Relations Board, Metcalf was asked to participate on a government committee that selected books to be included in US libraries abroad. McCarthy sought information from Metcalf on whether he had approved of the selection of a book written by Howard Fast, a Communist. If he had, would he approve it again? In his response to McCarthy, Metcalf endorsed freedom of information in all libraries, including those managed by the government, and stated plainly that if the opportunity arose, he would select Fast's book again. McCarthy never responded.Metcalf 1988, pp. 228‚Äì229 After 17 years of service, Metcalf retired in 1955 and was named Director Emeritus.Kaser 1993, p. 569  Retirement  Headstone, Mount Auburn Cemetery Metcalf continued to be active in librarianship throughout his retirement. Based on his experiences in redesigning the Harvard Library System and other research libraries, he wrote the book Planning Academic and Research Library Buildings in 1965. This book is widely regarded as the most comprehensive work on the topic.Adamonis 1979, p. 23 He taught classes and seminars, including a stint as an adjunct faculty member at Rutgers University. Over the span of his career, he received many awards and honoraria, including 13 honorary doctorate degrees.Kaser 1993 p. 569 In 1963 he was awarded Honorary Membership in the American Library Association, recognizing contribution \\"so outstanding that it is of lasting importance to the advancement of the whole field of library service.\\" American Library Association, Honorary Membership. http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/176/all_years.

From the Gobelins' 1664 tapestry representing a space rocket, to Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon and George M√©li√®s' 1902 movie A Trip to the Moon, space and rocketry were present in French society long before the technological means appeared to allow the development of a space exploration program.

French postal stamp honouring Robert Esnault-Pelterie, 1967. In the beginning of the twentieth century, the origins of the French space program are tied to French technological developments in aerospace and astronautics, notably the nascent airplane and rocket industries. EA-EOLE rockets (as tested in 1940‚Äì1941 and 1951) Robert Esnault-Pelterie appears as one of the early pioneers in space exploration design and rocket science. From 1908, he studied propulsion and space flight; without knowing the work of Russian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky at that time, he derived the mathematical equations for interplanetary flight, flight durations, and engine propulsion, and was later nominated President of the Chambre Syndicale des Industries A√©ronautiques (Trade association of Aircraft industries) in 1912. From 1935 to 1939 he designed a high-altitude sounding rocket, but World War II interrupted his plans; German experts believed that the rocket could have reached its design goal of . Esnault-Pelterie convinced physicist Jean-Jacques Barr√©, a pioneer in rocket propulsion, to collaborate on the design of a self-propelled cryogenic rocket. Between 1927 and 1933, Barr√© did extensive research and developed a rocket that could reach the upper atmosphere and space, the EA-41 Eole (see picture).Jacques Villain, 1993 : Jean-Jacques Barr√© pionnier fran√ßais des fus√©es et de l'astronautique SEP, 1993 History The beginning of the institutional French space program dates back to 1946 when, right after World War II, the (LRBA, Ballistic and aerodynamic research laboratory) was formed in Vernon to develop the next generation of rockets, partly taking advantage of the German development of the V2 rocket. Before this and during the war, as Free France continued to work, the EA-41 was tested and improved by military personnel, from October 1942 through to 1945. 22 May 1952: V√©ronique N1 is successfully launched from the Saharan desert. In 1958, President Charles de Gaulle directed the creation of several space research committees. In 1959, the Comit√© d'√©tudes spatiales was born under the supervision of Pierre Auger. In 1961, de Gaulle signed the creation of the Centre National d' Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to coordinate French space activities. Development of Western Europe's first carrier rocket, the Diamant, began in 1962, first launched in Algeria. On November 26, 1965, Asterix, the first French satellite in space, is successfully launched by a Diamant rocket from the Algerian desert. It is active for 2 consecutive days before ceasing to transmit. In 1965, France's space launch pads and CNES settled in Kourou. In 1973, France impulsed the creation of the European Space Agency and became its first contributor. The French space budget, although stagnant since the early 2000s in constant euros, remains in absolute terms the largest of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the second largest national budget (after the United States of America) at ‚Ç¨2.33 billion. In 2004, this budget stood at ‚Ç¨1.698 billion, with ‚Ç¨685 million being transferred to the Paris-based ESA for the programs conducted under its supervision. Le Bourget airport museum, Paris The Ariane rocket family is France's own rocket family, whose use has been extended to the whole of ESA member countries. Its spaceport, near Kourou, was selected in 1964 to host all of France's launches. Later, it was selected as ESA's launch site. Before being in French Guiana, France's space launches were made from Algeria, in Colomb- B√©char and Hammaguir. The French space program thus benefits from the best ground position for launch sites on Earth, as its position 5.3¬∞ north of the equator allows rockets to gain propulsion from the spinning of the Earth when launched eastward (+460 m/s) and save on propellant. No other governmental launch sites allow this level of physical parameters. It is also able to launch satellites into polar orbits from this spaceport. Launch statistics Collaborations Columbus module France's public involvement in space technologies is also deep into European programs such as Columbus and Automated Transfer Vehicle, through Thales Alenia, headquartered in Cannes. The French space program includes collaborations between its institutions and other countries, European as well as other foreign countries and institutions (JAXA, ISRO, NASA, CNSA) in projects ranging from the Herschel Space Observatory to BepiColombo, Saral/Altika and the Planck space observatory. Since 2010, France and Russia have been collaborating on several space missions, including long-run science programmes like Cardiomed, dedicated to monitoring cardiovascular health in cosmonauts.https://cardiomed.cnes.fr/fr/CARDIOMED/Fr/index.htm In 2016, for the COP21, CNES and ISRO impulsed a groundbreaking and worldwide plan to unite all space agencies for the gathering of satellite information and detection on greenhouse gas emissions, allowing more precise measurements and decision making. In addition, CNES and ESA have a strong background of collaboration, notably building the largest single satellite surveyance program for earth's biological monitoring (Copernicus Programme). CNES has provided essential instruments (cameras) on an Indian mission to the Moon, launched in January 2018. A consortium led by the CNES also built Argos instruments on board the Indian mission Oceansat 3 in 2018. A third collaboration between the ISRO and French space actors (Laboratoire d‚Äô√©tudes spatiales et d‚Äôinstrumentation en astrophysique (Lesia), CNRS, Universit√© Paris-VI and Universit√© Paris-VII) has seen the launch of PicSat in January 2018, a nano-satellite that surveys the Beta Pictoris star for exoplanets.https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2018/01/09/un- microsatellite-a-l-affut-d-une-exoplanete_5239167_1650684.html In 2020, Solar Orbiter was launched by NASA, containing instruments designed by CNES and other French industrial actors. The French space agency was also responsible for the construction of the main instruments on the French-German-American InSight mission to Mars, which launched on 5 May 2018 and landed on 26 November 2018. On 20 October 2018, CNES and JAXA launched the BepiColombo mission to study the magnetic field of Mercury and map its surface. On 29 October 2018, the CFOSAT (China-France Oceanography SATellite) was placed into Earth orbit to study ocean surface winds and waves. After President Macron's state visit to China in January 2018, the French-Chinese collaboration in space was increased significantly and includes more in-depth collaboration, notably in the sharing of CFOSAT data, meant to study oceans and their interaction with the atmosphere, as well as in the SVOM program.https://presse.cnes.fr/fr/visite-detat-du-president-de-la-republique- en-republique-populaire-de-chine-renforcement-de-la Future projects The French mission TARANIS (with international collaboration) will be launched in 2020. It is the 1st satellite designed to observe lightning at altitudes of 20 to 100 km. The construction of the Ariane 6 launcher is underway, after being approved by all ESA countries in 2016. It is designed by Airbus Safran Launchers. 2022 will mark the launch of Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer. It will study Jupiter and three of its moons with a view to gaining new insights into how life emerged. This mission is a collaboration of CNES with CNRS and ESA. In 2025, France and Germany will launch their collaborative mission Merlin, due to study methane levels and concentrations in the earth's atmosphere.

He also played on Dave Berry's Western Pennsylvania All- Star team, a collection of early football star players, that was designed to compete with the star-heavy Duquesne Country and Athletic Club on December 3, 1898 at Exposition Park in Pittsburgh. In 1902 he played in the first National Football League for the Philadelphia Phillies. He also played for Franklin when it won the 1903 World Series of Football over the Watertown Red & Black at Madison Square Garden. Wood later became one of the first professional players to catch forward passes when they became legal in 1906. 1906 scandal Wood had a brief, but memorable, stint with the Canton Bulldogs. He played in just one game for team in 1906, but the game was for the \\"Ohio League\\" championship and was fought against Canton's rival, the Massillon Tigers. Wood was hired by Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, to play in the game after a player named \\"Gilchrist\\" became injured. The game resulted in a 13-6 Canton loss and the events following the game later became known as the Canton Bulldogs‚ÄìMassillon Tigers betting scandal. Wood was hinted as being persuaded by Wallace to throw the game for a profit in a, historically dismissed, 1934 book by Dr. Harry March entitled, Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs. Of the incident, March stated that Wallace persuaded a Canton player to deliberately throw the game. When accused by his teammates this player said he had simply obeyed orders. The player then quickly left town, on the first available train, while still in his uniform. However, this player, mentioned by March, was obviously Eddie Wood of Latrobe. March gave the impression that he was running for his life from angry fans and teammates, however, even before the second Canton-Massillon game began, it was announced that Wood would be on the first train back to Latrobe once the game ended. Not to mention that when Wood returned on the following Thursday with the Latrobe team, he was not attacked by the fans or his teammates. Also during the second Canton-Massillon game, Wood scored the Bulldogs only score of the game. As for following Wallace's orders, Wood often crashed the middle of the field on defense, allowing the Tigers to escape outside. However, Massillon was historically known for running up the middle of field. First forward pass Wood was erroneously credited for catching the first forward pass in pro football by Harry March in his book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs. During the second game of the Bullodgs-Tigers scandal on November 24, 1906 Wood reportedly caught a couple of the new forward passes. March somehow stated that those catches in a championship game, at the end of the season, were very first catches in professional football. It was later discovered that Peggy Parratt threw an earlier recorded pass to Bullet Riley on October 25, for professional football's first forward pass. A second recorded pass was thrown to Clark Schrontz two days later.

The textile, highly emblematic of Malagasy culture, consists of a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the body.Tortora, P.G. & Merkel, R.S. (1996). Fairchild's Dictionary of Textiles. New York: Fairchild Publications. Traditional lambas used for burial were often made of silk and cow hides while those for daily wear were more often made of raffia, pig skin, cotton or bast. They could range in color from a tie-dyed mess or solid white cloth, to striped red, white and black cloth found in most parts of the island, the geometric patterns in unique shades of green and brown produced by a handful of Sakalava villages, or the brilliantly multi-colored, complex weaves favored by the pre-colonial Merina aristocracy.Turner, J. (Ed.). (1996). \\"Madagascar\\", in The Dictionary of Art, Volume 20. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited. Today, it is common to find printed cotton or rayon lambas produced in India for the Malagasy market in addition to those fabricated locally.Green, R.L. (2003). Lamba hoany: proverb cloths from Madagascar. Africa Arts, 36(22), pp. 30‚Äì46. Besides its daily use as basic clothing, the lamba is also used for tying children to mothers' backs or as a cushion when carrying a heavy object on top of the head. The lamba is also used ritually to wrap the remains of the dead before placing them in the family tomb. Which after the ceremony are then placed on the dead for an order of respect to their souls. In Malagasy culture Merina woman in a white lamba The term lamba is the name in the Highlands dialect of the woven cloth that traditionally formed the essential article of clothing throughout Madagascar. This garment is known by other words in various regions where other dialects are spoken; in some parts of the east, for instance, the garment is known by the word simbo.Mullen Kreamer, Christine and Fee, Sarah. Objects as Envoys: Cloth, Imagery and Diplomacy in Madagascar. Smithsonian Institution, 2002. Many of the ways in which the cloth may be wrapped around the wearer are specified by a wide variety of terms that vary from region to region. The color, print and type of cloth varies from region to region. The largest lambas (lambamena) are made of a heavy white silk and are used to wrap the bodies of the deceased before placing them in the family tomb. Among some ethnic groups, lambas were also traditionally exchanged between a man and woman as part of their engagement ceremony, or as diplomatic gifts, as demonstrated by the two detailed silk lamba akotofahana (one multicolored, the other white-on-white) given in 1886 to President Grover Cleveland by Queen Ranavalona III on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art.Gifts and Blessings: The Textile Arts of Madagascar. Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Accessed on November 11, 2010. =Types= Colorful prints from Asia are popular in coastal towns. There are numerous types of lambas produced in Madagascar. The names can serve to distinguish the material used, pattern type, ritual purpose of the garment or the intended wearer. Names of lambas vary from one region to the next according to local dialects, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather representative of some of the most commonly distinguishable types of lamba. It is many types in Madagascar Lambahoany Lambahoany reading Coming home is lovely A printed cotton lamba typically featuring a proverb on the lower border of the design, identical to the kangas worn throughout eastern Africa. The lambahoany is presently the most commonly worn type of lamba. These are traditionally made of printed cotton featuring a repeated border design that encloses either a secondary pattern (often around a central medallion) or a large image depicting a pastoral scene from daily life. A popular proverb, or ohabolana, is typically written just above the center of the lower border. The uses of the ubiquitous lambahoany are numerous and varied. They are often wrapped to attach an infant to its mother's back, freeing her hands for other uses. They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a transport sack, a tablecloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they can be used as a cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head. Lamba akotofahana A woven silk lamba featuring highly complex geometric designs. Lamba mpanjaka A ceremonial lamba traditionally worn by nobles, the wealthy, or elders. Lambamena Lambamena shop A silk burial shroud. Lamba arindrano A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and cotton. Jabo-landy A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and raffia fibers. Laimasaka A traditional Sakalava raffia lamba commonly decorated with geometric ikat-dyed patterns and often used as a burial shroud. It is still a tradition in Madagascar.. Salaka A lamba worn as a loincloth, measuring about 30 cm wide and 300 cm long. =Modes of use= Hiragasy musicians wearing coordinating lambas The style of wearing the lamba likewise varies between regions and according to the gender of the wearer. Both sexes will wrap it around the waist, much like a sarong. Women will also wear it wrapped over or beneath the bust to form a sheath dress, often with matching lamba headdress. These styles can be paired with a tank top or other light shirt. Men may drape the lamba over one shoulder as a shawl over shorts or ‚Äì in cooler weather ‚Äì over a malabary, a long-sleeved, knee-length cotton tunic. Traditionally, the lamba is draped over the left shoulder but is draped over the right when in mourning. Among mature Merina and (to a lesser extent) Betsileo women, wearing a narrower version of the traditionally white lamba around the shoulders is a mark of \\"elegance, dignity, femininity and respect for tradition.\\"Ranaivoson, D. (2007). 100 Mots pour comprendre Madagascar. Paris: Maisonneuve & Larose. pp. 57‚Äì58. Narrow lambas may be worn like a sash. Men drape them diagonally across the chest or knot them around the waist, while women may wear them loosely over the shoulders. The sash-like fashion was popularized due to European influence and is especially typical of the costume of hiragasy dancers. Production Traditional lambas were most often woven on horizontal ground looms, the most common type of loom found in Madagascar. The weaver was most often a woman and would be seated to one side of the loom as she worked the threads.Kusimba, Chapurukha; Odland, J. Claire; Bronson, Bennet (Eds.). Unwrapping the Textile Traditions of Madagascar. Regents of the University of California, 2004. For many women, weaving formed a basic domestic responsibility required to produce clothing for family members. Surplus could be sold to supplement family income; this occurred most often among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands. As art Three lambahoany showing pastoral scenes from daily life The lamba akotofahana, the highly colorful lamba weaving style associated with the Merina aristocracy, consisted of complex geometric designs created by the uniquely Merina practice of using extra heddles across the loom to create raised bands of pattern. This striking statement of andriana class distinction in the imperial era was preserved in a toned-down form under colonial rule: the same intricate patterns were retained but the designs were woven in white-on-white to draw less attention to the statement of class and ethnic identity they made.Spring, C. (2010). African Art in Detail. London: British Museum Press. In recent years, the interest in (and demand for) traditional, highly-colored lamba akotofahana has increased among well-to-do Malagasy expatriates, tourists and textile aficionados, which has led to a resurgence in their production and sale in fine art galleries in Antananarivo.Silk Textile: Lamba Akotofahana British Museum. Accessed on November 12, 2010. Contemporary artists have turned their attention to the resurrection of these ancient, half-forgotten techniques, producing unique works of art featured in exhibitions at internationally renowned museums. At the American Museum of Natural History, for instance, a lamba akotofahana was displayed that had been woven entirely from the silk threads produced by the female golden orb-weaver spider.One Million Wild Spiders from Madagascar Supplied Silk for Rare Textile. American Museum of Natural History. Accessed on November 10, 2010.

Historical context The 1958 event was the only international rally of that era to be organised exclusively for cars with engines under 500cc. Races for small-engined cars were common at the time, but capacity limits for rallying were only used to differentiate classes: all other rallies, such as the Monte Carlo Rally, Tulip Rally, Alpine Rally and the Li√®ge‚ÄìRome‚ÄìLi√®ge Rally were open to cars of all engine capacities. Li√®ge-Brescia-Li√®ge therefore represents a unique, pioneering attempt to use rallying to promote economical, \\"green\\" transport. Following the Suez crisis of 1956 and consequent petrol shortages and rationing across Europe, many manufacturers and small volume car constructors brought out tiny vehicles offering transport for two to four people with very low fuel consumption. Some were primitive in the extreme, but others were surprisingly sophisticated. Organisers The Royal Motor Union of Li√®ge, Belgium, organisers of the Li√®ge-Rome-Li√®ge Rally (and later the Li√®ge-Sofia-Li√®ge and other events), under its Commissaire-G√©n√©ral Maurice Garot, decided to create a rally specifically for these tiny cars, to test them thoroughly and find out which, if any, were really capable of transporting two people at a good speed over all types of road conditions. Garot's rallies were famous (some would say notorious) as the toughest rallies for all cars at the time, using the hardest roads of the Alps and Dolomites mountain ranges with extremely tight time schedules. Officially it was not permitted to run an event at an average speed greater than 50 km/hour, so that was the speed stated in the Regulations. However, competitors of the time recall that if you drove at that speed, you would find yourself arriving at the next time control after it had closed... You drove to the times that the controls were open, which often required a much higher average speed. The times for the Li√®ge-Brescia-Li√®ge rally were probably more relaxed and it may well have kept to the 50 km/hour requirement (except on the German autobahns and in Yugoslavia, where it was permitted to run the event at 60 km/hour) but that was still an extremely difficult speed to average in such tiny-engined cars over the very challenging route, which included more than 20 mountain passes, including Vrsic in Slovenia and - twice - Europe's two highest road passes, Passo Stelvio and Passo di Gavia in the Italian Dolomites. Non-stop event To make the event even tougher for the tiny cars and their drivers, it was run almost non-stop. The cars left Li√®ge at 17.30 on Thursday, July 17, 1958 and drove in convoy to Spa. There they lined up to start from 21.00 that evening. They would not rest until Saturday morning, when they were due to arrive in Brescia, Italy (having driven 1970 km via Ljubljana in Slovenia) at 09.50. The cars went into parc ferme and could not be touched for eight hours. From 18.00, the cars left the Piazza Loggia in Brescia to drive back over the Gavia and Stelvio, through Austria, up the German autobahn and back to arrive at Spa, a claimed total distance of 3203 km, at 16.47 on Sunday. Results From the 29 cars that started the event - six British Berkeleys, seven Italian Fiat 500s, German-built four Z√ºndapps, two BMW Isettas, a Lloyd and a Messerschmitt TG500, French-built two Citro√´n 2CVs, one Panhard and two UMAPs and one Belgian-built Isard - just 13 were left - all seven Fiat 500s and all four Z√ºndapp 250s, plus the Lloyd and one UMAP. The event certainly proved which were the most durable, capable vehicles of their type. The winners were Arturo Brunetto from Italy and Alfredo Frieder from Argentina in a Fiat 500 Sport. Event revival In July 2008, ClassicRallyPress Ltd created a historic rally following as closely as possible the 1958 route, except for the sections on German autobahns which were changed due to the danger of running tiny cars at 60 km/h on unlimited- speed autobahns. Unlike 1958, the event was spread over 10 days, covering approx 200 miles per day and, while it was still competitive, every effort was made to help competitors keep their cars running and in the event. 54 cars left Li√®ge from 07.30 on Friday, July 11, 2008 and 50 drove across the finish line back in Li√®ge on the afternoon of Sunday, July 20 ‚Äì 50 years to the day after the pioneering first event. Winners of the Authentic category for cars of a type that could have competed in the original event were Patrick Pellen, Ronald Hagelen and Els van Beek from Netherlands in a Vespa 400 (intriguingly, a type of car that had been entered in the 1958 event but was not ready in time for the start). The Spirit category for slightly later cars up to 700cc was won by Alastair Caldwell and Tanya Annett in a BMW 700. The event took place again in July 2010 for cars up to 1200cc, maintaining its aim to promote rallying for small, economical cars, and was won by a 1936 Morgan F4 3-wheeler crewed by Hedwig and Nicole Rodyns and a 1962 Mini-Cooper driven by Ben and Mike Norton. In July 2011, the rally was run for cars up to 1500cc. The Authentic category for cars of a type built in or before 1958 was won by Andrew Murfin and Willy Cave in a 1949 MG TD; the Spirit category was won by Andrew Isherwood and Hilary Farbowski in a 1966 Mini 1293. In July 2012, in a change from the traditional small-engined cars, but maintaining the rally's tradition of catering for a specific motoring sector from the 1950s and just after, the rally was run for Jaguar XKs (Authentic Category) and E-types (Spirit Category). Winners of the XK category were Ian Fyfe and William Fountain in a 1953 XK 120 FHC, and of the E-type category were Roger Bricknell & Dennis Greenslade in a 1969 Series II roadster. In July 2013, the rally was run for TVRs, the winners being David & Adrian Turner in a 1998 Chimaera 400. After five years' break, the event returns to celebrate its Diamond Jubilee in 2018, when it will run from July 11 to July 22 for the same microcars that competed in 1958, with an additional category for slightly later, slightly larger-engined microcars. Night halts will be - Liege - July 11 & 22; Karlsruhe - July 12; Munich - July 13; Misurina - July 14; Ljubljana - July 15 & 16; Carezza - July 17; Brescia - July 18; Marlengo - July 19; Bernried - July 20; Bretten - July 21. For 2019, the event will be run for Triumph TR sports cars from TR2 to TR8 - reliving the glory days of sports car rallying in the 1950s and 1960s, when TR2, TR3, TR4 and TR6 performed gallantly on the Liege-Rome-Liege, Liege-Sofia-Liege and Marathon de la Route events, organised by the same team as the original Liege-Brescia-Liege.

She is speculated to have been daughter of either William VI, Duke of Aquitaine or William VII, Duke of Aquitaine, and perhaps remarried to Peter I, Count of Savoy. Following the death of his wife Ermesinda of Bigorre, Ramiro I of Aragon next appears with a wife named Agnes. It is believed Agnes outlived her husband, who died on 8 May 1063 after they were married for about a decade. They don't seem to have had any children. Since her name is one used frequently in the family of the Dukes of Aquitaine and Ramiro's family repeatedly would make marriage alliances with the ducal family, it has been proposed that Agnes herself also derived from that kindred although her precise placement has been subject to speculation. William VI and William VII have both been suggested as possible fathers.
