It started as an informal group steered by an ad hoc committee in 2000Donald Byrd and Michael Fingerhut: The History of ISMIR - A Short Happy Tale. D-Lib Magazine, Vol. 8 No. 11, . which established a yearly symposium - whence \\"ISMIR\\", which meant International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval. It was turned into a conference in 2002 while retaining the acronym. ISMIR was incorporated in Canada on July 4, 2008.ISMIR Letters Patent. Canada, July 4, 2008. Purpose Given the tremendous growth of digital music and music metadata in recent years, methods for effectively extracting, searching, and organizing music information have received widespread interest from academia and the information and entertainment industries. The purpose of ISMIR is to provide a venue for the exchange of news, ideas, and results through the presentation of original theoretical or practical work. By bringing together researchers and developers, educators and librarians, students and professional users, all working in fields that contribute to this multidisciplinary domain, the conference also serves as a discussion forum, provides introductory and in-depth information on specific domains, and showcases current products. As the term Music Information Retrieval (MIR) indicates, this research is motivated by the desire to provide music lovers, music professionals and music industry with robust, effective and usable methods and tools to help them locate, retrieve and experience the music they wish to have access to. MIR is a truly interdisciplinary area, involving researchers from the disciplines of musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science, electrical engineering and many others. Annual conferences Since its inception in 2000, ISMIR has been the world‚Äôs leading forum for research on the modelling, creation, searching, processing and use of musical data.

The Captain earned his first ability, the power of flight, after saving a woman who was kidnapped by some thugs. While Captain Atlantis is Captain Canada's primary teacher, Captain Canada has also received help and advice from Captain Freedom and Mademoiselle. He is able to communicate telepathically with other heroes and has been trained to ascend to higher levels of consciousness and politeness. Captain Atlantis is an ancient alien astronaut, one of the last remnants of a colony of a \\"godlike\\" race that occupied the lost city of Atlantis in prehistoric time and claimed responsibility for such feats as the moai on Easter Island and the Great Pyramids of Giza. Atlantis was intended to be a repository for all knowledge as a gift for mankind, but the godlike citizens decided to destroy the settlement once humans turned against themselves in war, fearing the knowledge would be used for evil. Atlantis (said to be located on the Grand Banks) and all members of this godlike race except Captain Atlantis cast themselves into oblivion, never to be discovered again until Vikings landed on Newfoundland in the tenth century A.D. Two assistants have been explicitly mentioned, the Silver Warrior (a woman wearing a stereotypical First Nations headdress) and the Golden Dove (a woman in a domino mask and cleavage-accentuating angel attire). Captain Atlantis preaches that there are leaders, currently imprisoned by world society, who, through New Age spiritualism, can break free, harness supernatural powers and lead society toward world peace.

The approach offers design principles with which PIM systems (e.g. operating systems, email applications and web browsers) can make systematic use of subjective (i.e. user-dependent) attributes. The approach evolved in three stages: (a) theoretical foundations first published in a Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology during 2003. The paper introduces the approach and its design principles (b) evidence and implementation was published in another JASIST paper in 2008. The paper gives empirical evidence in support of the approach as well as seven novel design schemes that derives from it (see also the user-subjective website). It has won the Best JASIST paper award in 2009.http://www.asis.org/awards/jasis_paper.html(c) specific design evaluation this stage has already begun with evaluation of the first user-subjective design prototype called GrayArea in a Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems paper published in 2009.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518745 Theoretical foundations The user-subjective approach takes advantage of the fact that in PIM the person who retrieves the information is the same person who had previously stored it. PIM can be seen as a communication between the person and him\\\\her self at two different times: the time of storage and the time of retrieval. The PIM system design should help facilitate that unique communication by allowing the user use subjective (user-dependent) attributes in addition to the standard objective ones. PIM systems should capture these subjective attributes when the user interacts with the information item (either automatically or by using direct manipulation interface) in order to help the user retrieve the item later on. The user-subjective approach identifies three subjective attributes ‚Äì the project which the item was classified to, its degree of importance to the user, and the context in which the item was used during the interaction with it. The approach also assigns a design principle for each. The principles (discussed below) are deliberately abstract to allow for a variety of different implementations. = The subjective project classification principle= The subjective project classification principle suggests that PIM systems design should allow all information items related to a project be classified under the same category regardless of whether they are files, emails, Web Favorites or of any other format. This stands in sharp contrast with the present PIM system design where there are distinct folder hierarchies for each of these formats. The current design forces the user to store information related to a single project in separate locations depending on their format causing the project fragmentation problem. = The subjective importance principle= The subjective importance principle suggests that the subjective importance of information should affect its degree of visual salience and accessibility: important information items should be highly visible and accessible as they are more likely to be retrieved (the promotion principle) and those of lower importance should be demoted (i.e. making them less visible) so as not to distract the user (the demotion principle). While the promotion principle is not new and has been widely applied in PIM system design, the demotion principle is novel and has been applied only sporadically in these systems. Currently these systems allow only two options: keeping information (where unneeded information items could clutter folders and obscure the target item) and deleting it (where there is a risk that the item will not be there when needed). Demotion suggests a third option where the item is less visible so it doesn‚Äôt distract the user but is kept within its original context in case the user would need it after all. = The subjective context principle= The subjective context principle suggests that PIM systems should allow users retrieve their information items in the same context that they had previously used in order to bridge the time gap between these two events. By \\"context\\" the approach refers to other information items that were used at the time of interaction with the item, thoughts that the users may have regarding the item, the phase the user got to in the interaction with the item and other people the user collaborates with regarding the information item. Evidence and implementations =Evidence= The user-subjective approach was evaluated in a multioperational designed study which used questionnaires, screen shots and in-depth interviews (N = 84). The research tested the use of subjective attributes in current PIM systems and its dependency on design. Results show that participants used subjective attributes whenever design allowed them to. When it didn't, they either used their own alternative ways to use these attributes or avoided using subjective attributes at all. Regarding the subjective project classification principle ‚Äì many of the participants' recent files, emails and web pages related to the same projects (indicating that they were working on the same project using different formats), and they had saved files of different format in the same project folders. However, as design does not suggest storing emails and web favorites with files, users avoid doing so. Regarding the subjective importance principle ‚Äì users tended to retrieve their important information from highly visible and accessible locations offered by current design (e.g. by using the desktop), however since current systems offers no way to demote files of low subjective importance participants tended to use their own walk around ways for doing so (e.g. by moving them to a folder called \\"old\\" inside their original folder). Regarding the subjective context principle ‚Äì participants tended to talk spontaneously about the context of their information items during the interview. These evidence imply that current PIM systems could possibly be improved if it would allow users to make more use of subjective attributes of their personal information. =Implementations= Each of the user-subjective design principles can be implemented in various ways. Moreover, as the approach is generative it offers PIM designers to use these principles in order to create their own user subjective designs. Below are design schemes that demonstrate an implementation of each of the principles. A more complete set of implementation examples can be found in the user-subjective website. The single hierarchy solution ‚Äì addresses the project fragmentation problem (the current situation where the users stores and retrieve their project-related files, emails and web favorites at different hierarchies) and implements the subjective classification principle by offering the user a single folder hierarchy for all information items. At the operation system level the users would navigate to a folder and find there all project related files, emails, web favorites, tasks, contacts and notes. This would allow them to retrieve all their project-related information items from a singel location regardless of their formats. When looking at these folders at their mail box the users would see only their emails and only web favorites through their browser. The single hierarchy design scheme has not been evaluated yet. Single Hierarchy folder GrayArea ‚Äì implements the demotion principle by allowing users to move subjectively unimportant files to a gray area at the bottom end of their folders. This clears the upper part of the folder from file that are unlikely to be retrieved while allowing the users to retrieve these unimportant file in their original context in case they are needed after all. GrayArea design scheme was positively evaluated (see next section).GrayArea design scheme ItemHistory ‚Äì is an implementation of the subjective context principle. It allows users to reach all information items that were previously retrieved while that information item was open. This design scheme has not been evaluated to date. Specific design evaluation The evaluation of specific designs is the third and final step of the approach development. It had begun with the assessment of GrayArea. =GrayArea evaluation= GrayArea was evaluated by using a prototype that simulated the participants' folders but included a gray area where they could drag & drop their subjectively unimportant files. In the study 96 participants were asked to clean up their folders from unimportant files once with GrayArea and once without it. Results show that the use of GrayArea reduced the clutter in folders, that it was easier for participants to demote files than to delete them and that they would use it if provided in their next operating system. These results encourage commercial implementation of GrayArea and the development and testing of other user-subjective designs. Chronological development The user-subjective approach was developed by Ofer Bergman during his Ph.D. at Tel Aviv University supervised by Prof. Rafi Nachmias and guided by Prof. Ruth Beyth-Marom. The research was partially funded by the Sacta Rashi foundation. In 2003 they had published a paper titled \\"The user-subjective approach to personal information management\\" at the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. In 2004 the paper was recognized by The American Library Association as field representative when choosing personal information management as one of the ‚Äúten top technology issues and trends in today's libraries‚Äù.http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/lita/litaresources/toptechtrends/midwinter2004.cfm#PIM Later it was presented in scientific conferences including CHI,http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124813 and ASISTWiley Interscience and invited talks including at the MIT Media Lab, the HCI Lab, University of Maryland Human ‚Äì Computer Interaction Lab and Microsoft Research at Cambridge. In 2008 they had published another JASIST paper called \\" The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems design: Evidence and implementations\\". The paper has won the best JASIST paper award for 2009. According to the jury, ‚ÄúThe paper was considered to be well-argued and documented, effective, intelligible, and potentially useful and applicable.‚Äù In 2007 Dr. Bergman had finished his Ph.D. and continued working on the approach with Prof. Steve Whittaker under an EU Mary Curie grant at Sheffield University. They produced a PIM workshop paper about the approach at CHI 2008 conference, and a together with Ed Cutrell of Microsoft Research a full CHI paper titled \\"It's not that important: Demoting personal information of low subjective importance using GrayArea\\" in 2009. In 2010 Dr. Bergman received a Marie Curie reintegration grant with Prof. Judit Bar-Ilan, Head of Information Science Department at Bar Ilan University, and became a faculty member at the department. The grant research plan called PIM includes further studies of the user-subjective approach.

The novel's full title is Zeluco: Various Views of Human Nature, Taken from Life and Manners, Foreign and Domestic. A combination of proto-Gothic villainy and Enlightenment rationality, Zeluco contains both main plot incidents and lengthy sections of social commentary. Plot summary =Early intrigues= The first quarter of the novel details Zeluco's numerous initial wrongdoings in rapid succession. The novel opens with an incident that, according to the narrator, illustrates Zeluco's violent temper and uncontrollable impulses. Irritated by his pet sparrow, the young Zeluco crushes it to death in his hand and ignores the remonstrances of his horrified tutor. Grown into a handsome, selfish, and cruel young man, Zeluco seduces and impregnates the niece of an important noblewoman. He then deserts the niece and spends two decadent years in Italy, draining his mother's resources. Once his mother has given him the last of her money, Zeluco drops his pretence of affection, and she dies of disappointment at his anger and spite. Unconcerned about his mother's death, Zeluco attempts to marry Rosolia, a young woman with a vast potential inheritance. Rosolia's mother, convinced that Zeluco is only after her daughter's money, pretends to be pregnant. Certain that Rosolia's inheritance will be greatly reduced, Zeluco abandons her, travels to Spain, enlists as an officer in the military, and follows his regiment to Cuba. Zeluco mistreats his men in an attempt to gain a promotion, but after being chastised by his superior officer, he turns his attention to a wealthy widow. Though he offers the widow tender affections until she agrees to marry him, he treats her with cold indifference once she signs over her money and property to him, and she dies of grief. Newly interested in the wife of his rich Portuguese neighbor, Zeluco courts the wife secretly until she refuses to meet him for fear of discovery and confesses her flirtations to her husband. The Portuguese disguises himself and stabs Zeluco. After a difficult recuperation, Zeluco attempts to avenge himself upon the Portuguese by making the man think Zeluco to be the father of his newborn son. After this plot fails, Zeluco leaves Cuba for Naples. =Pursuing Laura= The remaining three-quarters of the novel is devoted to Zeluco's interactions with a particular circle of aristocrats in Italian high society. Once established in Naples, Zeluco becomes interested in Laura Seidlits, the beautiful daughter of the widow Madame de Seidlits. Determined to meet Laura, he attempts to ingratiate himself with the nobleman Signora Sporza, Madame de Seidlits‚Äô first cousin. Though she pretends to oblige him, Signora Sporza distrusts Zeluco and senses his cruel character. Laura also instinctively dislikes Zeluco and refuses his proposal of marriage. Infuriated by Laura's disdain, Zeluco stages a false attempt of robbery, rape, and murder by having his valet attack Laura and Signora Sporza's carriage. Despite Zeluco's apparently heroic false rescue, Laura remains unmoved and unwavering in her decision not to marry Zeluco. Madame de Seidlits‚Äô bank fails, however, and after learning of her mother's financial distress and being pressured by Father Pedro, Laura agrees to marry Zeluco to preserve her mother's happiness and wellbeing. =After the marriage= As in the case of the rich widow, Zeluco treats Laura cruelly as soon as he achieves his goal and sates his appetites. Laura bears his ill treatment meekly, hides her misery, and presents a positive image of her married life. Signora Sporza, as well as Laura's newly arrived half-brother Captain Seidlits and his friend Baron Carlostein, suspects the true state of affairs. Laura and Baron Carlostein begin to fall in love with one another, but Laura cuts the relationship short because she is unwilling to violate her marriage vows. Oblivious to Laura's love for Carlostein, Zeluco erroneously believes Laura to be in love with a nameless Italian nobleman. Bored with Laura, Zeluco begins an affair with Nerina, a deceitful woman who pretends to be in love with men for financial gain. Nerina manipulates Zeluco through pretended fits of jealously and eventually convinces him that his and Laura's newborn son is really the bastard child of Captain Seidlits. Giving in to his natural jealousy and furious impulses, Zeluco snatches his son from Laura's lap and strangles the child. Laura immediately faints and remains out of her senses for a number of weeks. When Laura partially regains her senses, she sees a painting of the Massacre of the Innocents, screams, and falls into a feverish frenzy. When Baron Carlostein, Captain Seidlits, and Signora Sporza examine the picture, they realize that one of the soldiers strangling a child bears a strong resemblance to Zelcuo. Laura recovers from her fever with her senses intact and writes to Zeluco asking for a separation and promising she will tell no one about the murder. Captain Seidlits, however, labels the soldier in the picture with Zeluco's name. Baron Carlostein provokes Zeluco into a duel to spare Captain Seidlits. The night before the duel is to take place, Zeluco goes to Nerina's house unannounced and catches her with another lover, who stabs him in the stomach. On his deathbed, Zeluco repents of his amoral conduct and apologizes to Captain Seidlits. After arranging her affairs and giving monetary gifts to Zeluco's relations, Laura agrees to marry Baron Carlostein and moves to Berlin with her family.Moore, 2008 List of characters The novel includes a plethora of characters and subplots. Many remain unnamed, deemphasizing their identities and highlighting Zeluco's indiscriminating evildoing,Spacks 1990, p. 192 but others command large sections of the text. The ‚Äúsheer number of secondary characters and the range of subplots mean that Zeluco himself frequently disappears for large sections of the book and that interest in the central plot is diffused by an increasing focus on comic secondary characters.‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p.xxix Zeluco: The novel's title character, a brutal, vain, selfish Sicilian nobleman interested only in gaining riches and fulfilling his own desires. =Zeluco‚Äôs early intrigues= Zeluco‚Äôs father: The only person who successfully disciplines Zeluco. His death gives Zeluco's self-indulgent nature a free rein. Zeluco‚Äôs mother: Enamored of her son, she gives in to his every desire until she is no longer of use to him and dies of a broken heart. Countess Brunella: A noblewoman who delights in railing against young women who are unchaste. Countess Brunella‚Äôs niece: The first young woman who Zeluco pursues. He has a love affair with her until she becomes pregnant, then abandons her. Rosolia: The young heiress who Zeluco attempts to marry. She is prevented from doing so only by her mother's ingenuity. The widow: Zeluco's first wife. After obtaining all her lands and money, he treats her cruelly and she dies of a broken heart. Hanno: One of the widow's favorite slaves. Zeluco beats him so severely that he dies. His ill usage and Zeluco's violent treatment of his other slaves prompts the Physician's antislavery debate with Zeluco. The Cuban Physician: The doctor who attends both Zeluco and the Portuguese. Providing a voice of reason, he asks Zeluco to treat his slaves more kindly and convinces the Portuguese of his wife's innocence. The Portuguese: Zeluco's neighbor. He disguises himself in his wife's clothing and stabs Zeluco in the chest after learning that Zeluco was pursuing his wife. The Portuguese‚Äôs wife: Zeluco's would-be paramour, unjustly accused of bearing his bastard child. =The Seidlits circle= Signora Sporza: Madame de Seidlits‚Äô first cousin. A perceptive society woman, she dearly loves Laura and her mother, but her unwillingness to become involved in the affairs of others keeps her from preventing Laura and Zeluco's marriage. Madame de Seidlits: Laura's mother and Colonel Seidlits‚Äô wife. A devoted wife and mother, her one failing is her expensive tastes. Her inability to live within her income level contributes to Laura's willingness to marry Zeluco. Colonel Seidlits: Madame de Seidlits‚Äô late husband. A Protestant, he firmly refuses to attempt to convert his Catholic wife and rebuffs her attempts to convert him. Captain Seidlits: Colonel Seidlits‚Äô son and Laura's devoted half-brother. An excellent soldier whose fiery temper succeeds in the battlefield but leads to social tension. Laura Seidlits: Madame de Seidlits‚Äô daughter. Beautiful, intelligent, honorable, and accomplished, Laura is sensible of her own desires and strong enough to protect them. Only her affection for her mother weakens her resolve not to marry Zeluco. Baron Carlostein: Captain Seidlits‚Äô friend and fellow officer. His visit to the Seidlits household in Laura's childhood forms her idea of an ideal man. In love with Laura, he is willing to do anything to protect her from the evils of Zeluco. Father Mulo: A Neapolitan priest. A long-winded and opinionated relation of Laura and Madame de Seidlits, he persuades Madame de Seidlits to attempt to convert Colonel Seidlits to Catholicism. Father Pedro: Father confessor to Signora Sporza, Laura, and Madame de Seidlits. An insincere priest, he colludes with Zeluco to persuade Laura to marry him after accepting a bribe ostensibly used to improve the church. =The English= Mr. N‚Äî: A young English nobleman, nephew to a baronet and friend to Signora Sporza, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Squander, as well as Captain Seidlits and Baron Carlostein. He also loves Laura but does not express his feelings in deference to Carlostein. Mr. Transfer: A rich businessman who retired to the English countryside. Uncle to Mr. Steele and brother to Mrs. Steele, he eventually learns to value his relations in addition to his fortune after connecting with his nephew. Mrs. Steele: Mr. Transfer's sister, who married a poor man Mr. Transfer deemed an inappropriate husband. Though initially ignored by Mr. Transfer after her husband's death, she reconciles with her brother and comes to live with him after Mr. Steele brings them together. Mr. Steele: Nephew of Mr. Transfer. Jovial, amicable, unaccomplished, and in love with Miss Warren, he eventually gains her hand in marriage after being improved by his travels with Mr. N‚Äî. Miss Warren: Friend and companion of Lady Elizabeth, she lost her father in a naval battle. She initially refuses to marry Mr. Steele because of his mediocre education and skills. Lady Elizabeth: A noblewoman who is Mr. Transfer's neighbor, she is the benefactor of Miss Warren. Mr. Squander: A dour Englishman who gambles compulsively. =The Servants= The valet: Zeluco's valet, willing to assist Zeluco in his various plots. Notably, he seduces the Portuguese's wife's maid and pretends to be robber threatening Laura's carriage. He betrays Zeluco to Signora Sporza, however, after Zeluco ignores him after courting Nerina. George Buchanan: Mr. N‚Äî‚Äôs Scottish servant. A Protestant, Buchanan attempts to sever any connection between Mr. N‚Äî and Laura for fear of his master marrying a Catholic. A Whig, Buchanan opposed the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Duncan Targe: Captain Seidlits‚Äô Scottish servant. Targe supported the Jacobite uprising, and his and Buchanan's political differences lead them to duel with claymores. =Other characters= The Italian Nobleman: A member of high society in Italy. Because of his interest in Laura, Zeluco erroneously suspects that Laura returns the Nobleman's affections Nerina: A young con artist who attracts Zeluco's attention and places him under her power. Nerina's pretended affection for Zeluco and jealousy of Laura cause Zeluco to murder his son and lead to his downfall. Bertram: morally upright son of a clergyman. Zeluco wins a huge portion of Bertram's money through gambling. Zeluco initially considers employing Bertram as a confederate in his plots, but reconsiders after discovering Bertram's good character. Themes and motifs ‚ÄúVice leads to endless misery‚Äù: Present in the opening sentence in the novel, this theme recurs through comments from both the narrator and the characters. As Kelly notes, remarks about Zeluco's inner feelings illustrate Moore's Enlightenment emphasis on characters‚Äô internal states.Kelly 1989, p.226 Being uneducated: Zeluco disdains learning, Mr. Steele receives a mediocre education, the servants hold irrational prejudices in favor of their own countries, and Mr. Transfer confuses the Roman statues in his garden.Perkins 2008, p. xxxi Public opinion: People in Zeluco's and Countess Brunella's social circles are delighted when they suffer, but every person who knows Laura grieves at her distress. Constant mental suffering of wrongdoers: The narrator frequently comments on Zeluco's persistent unhappiness despite his material wealth and comfortable situation. Bumbling, interfering servants: The Portuguese couple's maid is used against them, Buchanan steers Mr. N‚Äî away from Laura because he deems her religion unacceptable, Buchanan's letter becomes an object of amusement for the aristocrats and the reader. Reason versus passion: Laura, the Cuban physician, and Colonel Seidlits embody reason, while Zeluco, his mother, and Captain Seidlits give in to their emotions. Physiognomy: Laura and Madame de Seidlits discuss whether or not a person's character manifests itself in his or her appearance; the narrator remarks that Zeluco is handsome despite his evil nature. Manipulation, power and control: Zeluco dissembles in order to achieve his sexual conquests; he becomes obsessed with forcing Laura to yield to his desires; he feels the need to both display her beauty and prevent other people from interacting with her. Incorrect assumptions: Zeluco initially assumes that Laura is attracted to him and is astonished when she refuses his proposal; he later believes that she is attracted to the Italian Nobleman; he never doubts Nerina's affection for him. The Portuguese and later Zeluco himself are easily led to believe that their sons are bastards based only on manufactured circumstantial evidence. Love versus money: Mrs. Steele marries for love, while Mr. Transfer is shocked that she does not choose the more affluent match he arranges for her; Laura adamantly refuses to marry Zeluco because she does not love him, but is eventually forced into doing so because of a need for money. Filial affection: Laura is willing to sacrifice her personal happiness for her mother's; Zeluco cares only about himself and disregards his filial duty to his mother. Parallels As Zeluco himself notes, his strangulation of his son mirrors the crushing of his sparrow when he was a child. As the narrator notes but Zeluco fails to see, Nerina seduces Zeluco just as he seduces Rosolia and the widow; she also convinces him that his child is a bastard, just as he convinces the Portuguese of the same untruth. Foils Bertram as Zeluco's foil: Bertram delights in helping others and values moral satisfaction over material comforts; Zeluco thinks only of his own pleasure and is disturbed by Bertram's mention of economy and charity. Laura's near-death as the foil to Zeluco's: When Laura sinks into illness after her son's death, her servants dread her death; when Zeluco lies ill after the Portuguese's stabbing, his slaves mourn his recovery. Style Point of View: The narrator is third person omniscient; although not an epistolary novel, Zeluco does include letters from one character to another. Mixing Genres: The narrator claims in the opening paragraphs that the novel is a morality tale, but Zeluco is really a complex combination of genres. The book is often portrayed as an early Gothic novel, but the text does not adhere strictly to the Gothic genre, emphasizing realistic situations rather than fantastical Gothic settings and events. Moreover, Zeluco lacks the deliberate creation of supernatural or apparently supernatural terror present in novels such as Ann Radcliffe‚Äôs The Romance of the Forest. Instead, the novel focuses on the everyday causes of Zeluco‚Äôs evil (an impulsive, selfish nature and an overindulgent parent) and his downfall (the vain assumption that his lover truly cares for him).Perkins 2008, p.xxviii-xxix Pam Perkins, editor of the 2008 edition of Zeluco, succinctly explains this odd combination: ‚ÄúIn Zeluco, Enlightenment rationality meets Gothic excess.‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p. ix Gary Kelly also links Zeluco to the Enlightenment, noting that all of Moore's novels serve as ‚Äúvehicle[s] for Enlightenment social criticism.‚ÄùKelly 1989, p. 220 (See discussion of social commentary below.) Zeluco is the novel's most unenlightened figure, and his excessive passions and uncontrolled impulses lead to his downfall; moral characters such as Bertram privilege rational thought over emotion and are rewarded for doing so.Perkins 2008, p. xxvi Zeluco also reflects Moore's earlier works of travel literature: character reactions to and descriptions of the countries they visit echo the writings in a travel diary.Perkins 2008, p. xxx Humor: Zeluco contains many instances of dry humor. One example occurs when Rosolia claims that the suitor she marries after Zeluco abandons her is the only man who can make her completely happy. Her mother responds, ‚ÄúI hope, my dear, [‚Ä¶] he is the only man who ever will attempt it.‚ÄùMoore 2008, p. 24 Other characters, such as Buchanan, Targe, and the various priests, are mocked for their small-mindedness and obstinacy, illustrating Moore's Enlightenment emphasis on reason and education.Perkins 2008, p.xxxiScots Magazine 1789, p.282 Tone: Though serious when discussing Zeluco's mental disturbance due to his wrongdoing, the narrator's ‚Äúurbanely amused voice‚Äù acts as a ‚Äúunifying force‚Äù for the novel.Perkins 2008, p. xxx As both 18th century and contemporary critics note, this humorous tone renders Zeluco‚Äôs moral message and long interludes unrelated to the main plot palatable to readers.European Magazine 1789, p. 249 Epigraphs: Almost all of the novel‚Äôs 100 chapters begins with brief quotations from well-known authors such as Alexander Pope, Shakespeare, Ovid, Virgil, and Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld. Each quotation corresponds to the subject matter of the chapter it introduces. For example, the chapter in which Zeluco mistreats his troops out of a vain desire to impress his superior officers begins with ‚ÄúLa ferocit√© naturelle fait moins de cruels que l‚Äôamour proper‚Äù (‚ÄúNatural ferocity makes fewer people cruel than does self-love‚Äù). The epigraphs, many of which are in Latin or French, provide a marked contrast Zeluco's lack of education and also imply that Moore wrote for an educated readership that could ‚Äúshare the narrator‚Äôs easy cosmopolitanism‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p. xxxi Social Commentary: Many critics note the novel's extensive asides regarding social issues of Moore's time; some argue that the social commentary equals or overshadows the overtly moral message of the primary plot.Perkins 2008, p.xxix =Examples of social commentary= The Slavery Debate: The debate on slavery takes place early on in the novel, after Zeluco gains a plantation in Cuba (one location in the novel that Moore notably did not visit) and becomes a cruel master of the slaves there. The titular villain is unsurprisingly pro-slavery, while an educated physician ‚Äì possibly provided as a stand-in for Moore's own opinions on the subject ‚Äì makes the arguments against slavery. These arguments cover the differing perspectives of the time, including whether or not the slaves were better off in slavery than they were in their own countries. They also argue whether the African people are equal to Europeans, and notions of property and the right to own people as property. This debate eventually leads to the question of whether it is better to be seen as ‚Äúthe distributor of happiness‚Äù or the ‚Äúinflictor of pain‚Äù,Perkins 2008, p.62 a problem that will follow Zeluco throughout the story, both in his military career and eventual marriage to the virtuous Laura. Moore's anti-slavery stance in Zeluco is particularly notable because of its being published in 1789, which marked roughly the beginning of the British abolitionist movement. The first meeting of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed on 22 May 1787 ‚Äì 20 years before the slave trade was abolished with the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807. The campaign was heavily influenced by slave uprisings in the West Indies, which was where Zeluco held his own fictional plantation, and was supported by hundreds of thousands of people, including ‚Äì in all probability, judging by the arguments in Zeluco ‚Äì Moore himself. Moore also provides a sympathetic slave character in the form of Hanno to stand opposite his villainous slave owner, just another piece of evidence for his anti-slave trade stance. Religious Intolerance: Protestantism vs. Catholicism: In one of quite a few asides Moore makes for his minor characters, a debate takes place between the late Colonel Seidlits and his Protestant clergyman relation about whether or not it is proper to convert Colonel Seidlit's Catholic wife to Protestantism, which Moore ‚Äì a Protestant himself ‚Äì tends to portray as the superior religion. Throughout the novel, priests are shown as either corrupt (like the bumbling and easily bought Father Pedro), incompetent (like the Cuban priest who riles up the Portuguese and his wife rather than helping them), or unnecessarily long-winded (like Father Mulo). They also tend to interfere where they should not, like in Laura's ill-advised marriage to Zeluco, the multiple failed conversions from both Protestantism to Catholicism and vice versa, and the dangerous ruse against the Portuguese family. This division between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism can be traced all the way back to the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century, when Martin Luther, among other Protestant leaders, sought to break away from the old customs and rituals of the church in order to make religion more accessible. In his debate with Colonel Seidlets, the clergyman makes reference to the arguments against the Catholics placing too much faith in rituals like transubstantiation,Perkins 2008, p.136 and directly refers to historical events taking place during the Reformation, as well.Perkins 2008, p.138-9 Despite this divide between the two religions (which can also be seen in Buchanan's refusal to allow his Protestant master, Mr. N‚Äî, to marry the Catholic Laura), Colonel Seidlits steadfastly refuses to denounce his wife's religion and insists that everyone should be able to practice their own religious beliefs without feeling pressure to convert. In this way he stands in sharp contrast to the negatively portrayed priests and clergymen who disdain every religion except their own, so it could be argued that Moore is not so much supporting Protestantism but encouraging freedom of religion. Scottish Politics: Being a Scotsman himself, Moore also includes a debate on the state of Scottish politics about three quarters of the way through the novel, in which two proud Scottish servants ‚Äì Buchanan and Targe ‚Äì argue about the Jacobite Rising of 1745, during which Charles Edward Stewart attempted to reclaim the British throne. This eventually leads to an argument about Scottish nationalism, including whether Mary, Queen of Scots plotted to kill her husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and whether Scotland should have joined with England under the Acts of Union 1707. The issues are presented as polarizing the Scottish nation, showing the divisions between the Whig and Tory parties in particular, and especially their opinions on kings and the rights of royalty. Targe ‚Äì the Tory ‚Äì has loyalty for the divine right of kings, whereas Buchanan ‚Äì the Whig ‚Äì is more loyal to country than king. Moore's inclusion of this debate and the resulting duel shows the powerful nature of Scottish national pride, which is also shown when the overly patriotic Buchanan is injured in a duel between the two Scotsmen and refuses treatment from a French physician, instead insisting that he will wait until one of his own countrymen is available. National Stereotypes: In 1772 Moore was hired as the tutor and private physician to the young Duke of Hamilton, and ended up accompanying the young nobleman on his Grand Tour through Italy, Germany and France.Perkins 2008, p.xi This Tour was meant to expose the young Duke to foreign societies, through which he would learn about other countries‚Äô languages, architecture, geography, and culture and return to his own country ready to join the British ruling class. During this time Moore was exposed to high-class societies that a man of his station would normally never get to see, and the experience ‚Äì notably his time among the upper echelons of Italy ‚Äì greatly influenced his portrayal of high Italian society seen in Zeluco.Perkins 2008, p.xi Moore's visits to other countries can also be seen in his characters‚Äô ‚Äì particularly Baron Carlostein, Captain Seidlits, Mr. N‚Äî, and Mr. Steele ‚Äì discussions of the traits of people from different countries, especially France, Italy and England. The English are generally portrayed as ‚Äúreserved‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p.271 and melancholy, whereas the Italian are ‚Äúingenious‚Äù and ‚Äúcivilized‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p.270-271 and the French are ‚Äúfrank‚ÄùPerkins 2008, p.271 and ‚Äì according to the minor character Thomas Dawson ‚Äì quite dissimilar to the Scottish, particularly in their armies and unequal treatment of women.Perkins 2008, p.275-6 Critical reception =Initial response= Zeluco was immediately and immensely successful. Although anonymous, the book was generally attributed to Moore because of its similarity in style to his travel literature.European Magazine 1789, p. 249 Most reviews at the time of publication lauded both the literary technique and moral message of the novel. In June 1789, Scots Magazine asserted that Zeluco ‚Äúis not a common novel,‚Äù praising Moore for creating a work of lasting merit and a positive moral message ‚Äúwhich, until men change their natures, can never be too often inculcated, or too powerfully enforced.‚ÄùScots Magazine 1789, p.279-80 The European Magazine and London Review expressed a similar opinion in October 1789 and placed a particular emphasis on Moore's ability to express serious messages in a ‚Äúlively style‚Äù and create a narrator who is a ‚Äúlaughing philosopher.‚ÄùEuropean Magazine 1789, p. 249 The September 1789 issue of The English Review, however, was highly critical, deeming Zeluco a merely mediocre novel. The reviewer disparaged Moore's many subplots and asides as useless digressions and takes issue with his mocking portrayal of priests and his favorable portrayal of physicians.English Review 1789, p. 216-218 =Influence= Zeluco provided inspiration for the title character of Lord Byron‚Äôs poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and was transformed into a stage play in 1812.Perkins 2008, p. vii Anna Laetitia Barbauld‚Äôs glowing review in an 1810 edition of The British Novelists seemed to indicate the novel‚Äôs lasting success.Barbauld 1820, p. i-vii Zeluco‚Äôs popularity faded, however, and the novel remained out of print from 1827 to 2008.Perkins 2008, p. xxxiv =Modern views= Twentieth century literary critics tended to ignore Zeluco, and their opinions of the book were generally not favorable.Perkins 2008, p.vii-viii Patricia Meyer Spacks asserts that Zeluco‚Äôs wholly evil character is flat rather than compelling, and that Laura‚Äôs sensibility serves only to remove all traces of her agency. She claims that the combination of Zeluco‚Äôs and Laura‚Äôs intrinsically opposite personalities leads only to a ‚Äúnarrative stalemate.‚ÄùSpacks 1990, p. 190-195 Pam Perkins, however, argues against such negative criticism, maintaining that the central plot of the novel was not Moore's sole focus. Examining Zeluco‚Äôs Enlightenment-driven narrative style and incisive social commentary, she contends, can offer new insights into life at the end of the 18th century.Perkins 2008, p. xxix-xxxiv  Notes  References Online version: * Volume I * Volume II *Barbauld, Anna Laetitia, ed.

It is located northeast of Kamloops, British Columbia. It was closed in 1988. It was operated as part of the Pinetree Line network controlled by NORAD. History As a result of the Cold War and with the expansion of a North American continental air defence system, The site at Kamloops was selected as a site for a United States Air Force (USAF) radar station, one of the many that would make up the Pinetree Line of Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) radar sites. Construction on the base began in 1956 and was completed in 1957. The base was manned by members of the USAF's Air Defense Command (ADC) 825th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, being known as Kamloops Air Station. In September 1957, operations began at the unit's permanent home. The station was equipped with AN/FPS-3A, AN/FPS-20, AN/FPS-87A; AN/FPS-6B, and AN/FPS-507 radars. As a GCI base, the 918th's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. These interceptors were based at the 25th Air Division, Larson Air Force Base in Washington. In the early 1960s, the USAF relinquished control of the base to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). This was part of an arrangement with the United States that came as a result of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Canada would lease 66 F-101 Voodoo fighters and take over operation of 12 Pinetree radar bases. Upon hand-over on 1 April 1962, the operating unit was inactivated and replaced by the RCAF No. 56 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and the base became RCAF Station Kamloops. Radars at the station were also upgraded to the following: * Search Radars: AN/FPS-3A, AN/FPS-20, AN/FPS-87A * Height Radars: AN/CPS-6B, AN/FPS-507 Radar operations at 56 Squadron were automated on 1 May 1963 by the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the station became a long-range radar site. It would no longer guide interceptors but only look for enemy aircraft, feeding data to the Spokane Air Defense Sector SAGE DC-15 Direction Center of the 25th NORAD Region. As a result of the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, the new Canadian Forces organization absorbed the RCAF, RCN and the Canadian Army. 56 Radar Squadron, RCAF Station Kamloops, became simply Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Kamloops in 1967. Beginning in 1983 the station began reporting to Canada West ROCC. CFS Kamloops closed on 1 April 1988, the 64th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The Station briefly came back to life when the movie \\"Cadence\\", starring Charlie Sheen and Laurence Fishburne, was filmed at the site in 1990. The site is now virtually abandoned, except for two areas now used by Telus, which has a communication installation. The buildings stood until around 1997 but have since been removed. The city of Kamloops moved the last search antenna to be used at CFS Kamloops, an AN/FPS-20, to Riverside Park as a memorial to the former radar station.

He was born in Tehran, Iran, on February 2, 1940, and is a consulting physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Early life Gharib grew up in Tehran, the son Dr. Mohammad Gharib (1909‚Äì1975), a former professor and chair of pediatrics at Tehran University (1938‚Äì1975), and Zahra Gharib (1915‚Äì2010), daughter of Ostad Abdolazim Gharib (1877‚Äì1965), a professor of Persian literature. Both his father, Mohammad Gharib, and his grandfather, Abdolazim Gharib, were honored by postage stamps issued by the government of Iran (see Mohammad Gharib, Mayo Clinic Proc 67:339, 1992). Gharib has two sisters, Nahid Ziai and Mayram Comninos, and one brother, Dr. Mohsen Gharib. Gharib attended Ferdowsi Grade School (1946‚Äì1952) and later Alborz High School (1952‚Äì1958), graduating with honors in 1958. He traveled to the United States to study of medicine. He received a B.S. degree from the Ohio State University in 1962. He went on to receive a medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1966, and took his internship at Philadelphia General Hospital from 1966 to 1967. He completed an internal medicine residency (1967‚Äì1969) and fellowship in endocrinology and metabolism (1969‚Äì1971) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. After a visiting fellowship in reproductive endocrinology at the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons in New York City, he joined the Mayo Clinic faculty in Rochester in 1972. Professional career In 1974, he returned briefly to Iran, where he was initially a consultant at the Queen Heart Hospital before being appointed medical director of the Reza Pahlavi Medical Center (1975‚Äì1977). Gharib later became the associate dean of the College of Health Sciences (1977) and served as the director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Saadat-Abad Medical Center, National University (1977‚Äì1979). In June 1979, he returned to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester to become professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, and a consultant in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nutrition. He also teaches and conducts clinical research. Research In 1971, Dr. Gharib and his colleagues developed the first radioimmunoassay (RIA) to measure triiodothyronine (T3) in human serum. Published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM) between 1970 and 1971, his initial observations hold true today.JCEM 95 (8):4097-98, 2010 This was a major development that allowed further extensive studies on the mechanisms of thyroid hormones physiology and metabolism. In the 1980s, Dr. Gharib focused his attention on nodular thyroid disease (NTD) and thyroid cancer, making a number of important contributions to thyroid practice. For example, an early paper emphasized the importance of NTD in clinical practice (New England Journal of Medicine, 1985); several studies illustrated the technique, accuracy, and impact of thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in the management of nodules (Acta Cytol, 1987; Annals of Internal Medicine, 1993); and defined the limitations of FNA (Annals, 1984). He gets credit for helping establish the accuracy and safety of thyroid FNA biopsy in the management of thyroid nodular disease. His seminal study published in NEJM in 1987 was a landmark report that challenged the conventional wisdom that long-term thyroid hormone therapy shrinks thyroid nodules. This report initially sparked considerable controversy but, when confirmed by others, eventually changed medical practice and thyroid hormones are no longer used to suppress benign nodular goiters (Annals 1998; Endocrinology & Metabolism Clinics of North America 2007). He was one of the first to draw attention to the high prevalence of the incidentally discovered thyroid nodules, \\"thyroid incidentalomas\\", and described steps in diagnosis and challenges in their management (Arch Int Med, 1995; Annals, 1997; Endocrinology & Metabolism Clinics of North America, 2000). Dr. Gharib in his Mayo Clinic Office, 2008 Publications, Lectures and Memberships Gharib co- edited the first evidence-based endocrinology textbook, originally published in 2003, with the fourth edition printed in 2020. In 2013, he and three colleagues edited and published the textbook Endocrinology: A Problem-Oriented Approach. In 2017 he published the book Thyroid Nodule. Other published works include more than 120 peer-reviewed original papers, 50 review articles and 30 textbook chapters. He travels worldwide to teach and lecture, and by 2020 he had lectured at 350 endocrine events in more than 35 countries. He takes pride in regularly visiting his home country, Iran, to teach and educate. He is a member of the American Medical Association (AMA), Minnesota Medical Association (MMA), AACE, Endocrine Society, American College of Physicians (ACP), and the American Thyroid Association (ATA). He was a member of the MMA Committee on CME (2007‚Äì2010) and chaired that committee from 2006 to 2009. He has served on numerous ATA committees, including Awards, Development, Membership, Patient Education & Advocacy, and Public Health. He has served on the editorial boards of Acta Endocrinologia (Romania); EndocrinologyNews; JCEM; Endocrine Practice; International Journal of Endocrinology; U.S. Endocrinology; Portuguese Journal of Endocrinology; Diabetes & Metabolism; and Thyroid.

Formerly it also carried the warning that silent people are dangerous, as in Suffolk's comment on a fellow lord in William Shakespeare's play Henry VI part 2: :::Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, :::And in his simple show he harbors treason... :::No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man :::Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.3.i.53-7 According to The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs, the first mention of the proverb appeared in Classical times in the form altissima quaeque flumina minimo sono labi (the deepest rivers flow with least sound) in a history of Alexander the Great by Quintus Rufus Curtius and is there claimed as being of Bactrian origin.De Rebus Gestis Alexandri Magni, VII. iv. 13 The earliest use in English sources goes back to 1400.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs, \\"STILL waters run deep\\", p.307 in the 2003 e-edition The fable J.

In 1692 Roger L'Estrange included an outline of the Abstemius version in his edition of the fables under the title of A Country-man and a River, along with the interpretation that men of few words are dangerous: :A Country-man that was to pass a River, sounded it up and down to try where it was most fordable: and upon Trial he made this Observation on't: Where the Water ran Smooth, he found it Deepest; and on the contrary, Shallowest where it made most Noise. There's More Danger in a Reserv'd and Silent, than in a Noisy, Babbling Enemy.Mythfolklore.net Slightly earlier than L'Estrange's translation, there was an amplified version of the story in La Fontaine's Fables under the title \\"The torrent and the river\\" (Le torrent et la rivi√®re, VIII.23). It tells of a man trying to escape a robber who easily fords a turbulent stream but drowns in a smooth-flowing river, ending on the caution that 'Silent folk are dangerous'. An English version The French proverb that is the nearest equivalent to the English 'still waters run deep' also emphasizes this danger: 'no water is worse than quiet water' (Il n‚Äôest pire eau que l‚Äôeau qui dort). When the caricaturist J. J. Grandville illustrated La Fontaine's fable, he further underlined this meaning by transposing it into a seduction scene. In the background a capering donkey and a shrew are advancing along the road, watched by a woman whose hands are clasped by a sleek cat. Unnoticed at her feet, a snake is slithering through the grass.

The following year he started his first professional coaching job with the NFL's Washington Redskins, and became the defensive line coach of the Miami Dolphins three years later. He stayed with the Dolphins for 15 seasons, during which the team won two Super Bowls, until his retirement. Scarry was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 2000. High school, college and military service Scarry grew up in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, and played on his high school's basketball and football teams. Scarry attended Waynesburg College, a small school in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, where he continued to play football and basketball. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II in North Africa, but came down with asthma and was given a medical discharge. He signed with the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League starting in 1944. Professional career Scarry began the 1944 season with the Rams at left tackle, but was shifted to center in September. He played on both defense and offense. After a season in which the Rams contended for but lost the NFL's western division, Scarry spent the offseason as a student at Western Reserve University in Cleveland and served as the director of a YMCA camp in Mantua, Ohio. Scarry suffered a knee injury near the beginning of the 1945 season, but soon returned to action as the Rams, led by quarterback Bob Waterfield, won the NFL championship. Scarry was the captain of the Rams during the championship run. The Rams moved to Los Angeles after the 1945 season, and Scarry, along with teammates Chet Adams, Tommy Colella, Don Greenwood and Gaylon Smith, decided to stay in Cleveland and play for the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference. The Rams sought an injunction in Federal court to prevent Adams from defecting to the Browns, arguing that he was still under contract with the Rams despite the move. Adams argued that his contract described a team in Cleveland, and was no longer valid because of the Rams' relocation. A judge ruled in favor of Adams in August 1946, clearing the way for him and other former Rams players to join the Browns. While Scarry was playing for the Browns, he was named head basketball coach at Western Reserve, where he had taken classes between games and in the offseason. In his first season, Scarry often played between 50 and the full 60 minutes of games, playing on the offensive and defensive lines. Toward the middle of the season, Cleveland coach Paul Brown began to use him as the defensive leader, letting him call the unit's formations. In December, Scarry's Western Reserve basketball team played its first games; he had missed numerous practices because of his duties with the Browns. The Browns went on to win the AAFC championship later in the month. Scarry remained with the Browns the following season. In September 1947 he received a bachelor of science degree from Western Reserve, completing an educational career at Waynesburg that was cut short by the war. By October, he was mentioned as a possible successor to Tom Davies, who had resigned as Western Reserve's football coach. While still one of the AAFC's top centers, Scarry was bothered by injury and asthma and was considering leaving pro football. The Browns, meanwhile, won a second straight AAFC championship in December. Scarry was named Western Reserve's football coach the following January, ending his career with the Browns. Frank Gatski took over as the Browns' regular center after Scarry's retirement. Coaching career Scarry borrowed Paul Brown's coaching techniques at Western Reserve, instituting well-organized practices there. \\"I had a lot of ideas about coaching before I went to work for the Browns,\\" he said in 1947. \\"But the manner in which Paul organized his practice and all his duties impressed me. I try to do the same here.\\" With no good passer or runner and a lack of depth, Western Reserve's Red Cats performed poorly in Scarry's first season, but he was praised for making the most out of a thin squad. In 1949, his second year, the Red Cats improved to a 4‚Äì5‚Äì1 (win‚Äìloss‚Äìdraw) record, and Scarry was expected to stay on for a third season. The following year, however, he resigned to take an assistant coaching position at Santa Clara University in California under former Browns assistant Dick Gallagher. Scarry was at Santa Clara for the 1950 and 1951 seasons, then went to Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. He stayed at Loras for two years, moving to Washington State College of the Pacific Coast Conference in 1954. He left in November 1955, when head coach Al Kircher was fired in the wake of a 1‚Äì10 season. In February 1956, he was hired as a line coach by the University of Cincinnati. During his time at Cincinnati, Scarry served as an assistant to Otto Graham, the former Browns quarterback and teammate of Scarry's, as a coach in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the NFL champion and a selection of the best college players from across the country. After seven seasons at Cincinnati, Scarry got his third head coaching job, for the Yellow Jackets at Waynesburg, his alma mater. He was also the school's athletic director. Scarry held the position for three seasons, from 1963 until 1965, and his teams had a 17‚Äì8‚Äì1 record during that span. Waynesburg won the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title in 1965, and Scarry was voted the conference's coach of the year. Scarry continued to act as the line coach under Graham for the college all-stars in the offseason during his tenure at Waynesburg. In 1964, he was inducted into football hall of fame of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, an association of smaller college sports programs. Graham became the head coach of the NFL's Washington Redskins in 1966, and he hired Scarry that year as his defensive line coach. Scarry stayed with the Redskins through 1968, when Graham resigned after three unsuccessful seasons and was succeeded by Vince Lombardi. Scarry then scouted briefly for the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Rams, and Dallas Cowboys before taking a job in 1970 as the defensive line coach for the Miami Dolphins under Don Shula, a former Browns player. He spent the remainder of his coaching career with the Dolphins, retiring after 15 years in 1986. Miami reached the Super Bowl five times while Scarry was a coach there, winning consecutive championships in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. Later life and death After retiring from football, Scarry worked informally for the Dolphins as a volunteer assistant. He moved with his wife, Libby, to Fort Myers, Florida, in 1994. Scarry was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 2000. He died in 2012 at his home in Fort Myers; he was the last surviving member of the original Browns team. He had four sons and a daughter. Mike was also the brother of professional basketball player Jack Scarry.

The Luboten Battalion was a military division of the Balli Komb√´tar which operated in Albania under Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Biography =Early life= D√´ralla was born in Kalkandelen in 1909. Gajur was the son of Albanian patriot Mehmet Pash√´ D√´rralla and brother of Halim D√´ralla, involved in Albania's independence movement, and Hysen D√´ralla, who would become a Major of the Luboten Battalion. D√´ralla studied at the Yugoslav military academy. During his years at the military academy, D√´ralla came into contact with Italian intelligence agency, OVRA. Deralla left the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and fled to Albania. In Albania, D√´ralla enlisted as a regular soldier in the Royal Albanian Army. On April 12, 1939, Italy occupied Albania. After the Italian occupation of Albania, Deralla became an Officer in the Royal Italian Army. =Return to Tetovo= In 1941, Italian forces occupied Vardar Banovina. D√´ralla returned to Tetovo, where he joined the Luboten Battalion as a Captain. The Battalion was responsible for securing the region from resistance groups, i.e. Yugoslav partisans. With the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany took control of the region. =Balli Komb√´tar= Despite the Luboten Battalion being formed by the Italian forces, The Germans did not disband the battalion.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner was of the opinion that its west door is \\"one of the best Norman doorways in England\\". The church stands in an isolated position to the west of the village. History The church dates from the 14th century. It formerly had a tower, but this fell in 1710. The church was restored in 1788‚Äì89. During this restoration a 12th-century doorway was moved into it from the nearby church of All Saints, which was being demolished. There were further restorations in 1858 and 1871. Architecture The Norman west doorway, brought here from All Saints' church St Mary's is constructed in brick, rubble and carrstone, parts of which have been rendered. The roofs are thatched. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave and a chancel with a north vestry, and a bellcote at the west end. The west doorway dates from the middle of the 12th century. Above it is a two-light window dating from 1858. On the west gable is a bellcote of 1871. In the south wall of the nave is a doorway with a plain arch, and to its east is a two-light early 14th-century window. The south wall of the chancel contains a two-light window, a priest's door over which is a finial, and a three-light 19th-century square-headed window. The east window has three lights. On the north side of the chancel is a two-light window, and there is another two-light window in the north wall of the nave. Inside the church are box pews dating from 1789; these were cut down in size in 1865. On the south wall of the nave are the remains of a wall painting depicting Saint Catherine with her wheel.

If this claim were true, Magee would not only have been the last surviving American Civil War veteran, but the oldest person to have ever lived. Life Magee claimed to have been born in North Carolina in 1841 to slaves Ephraim and Jeanette, who were held and worked on the J.J. Shanks plantation. He said that he was purchased at the age of 19, just before the American Civil War, by plantation owner Hugh Magee at a slave market in Enterprise, Mississippi. Hugh Magee owned the Lone Star Plantation in Covington County, Mississippi. Sylvester adopted the Magee surname, a common practice among enslaved people at the time. Shortly afterward, he was sold again, to Victor Steen of Rankin County, Mississippi. Magee claimed that in 1863, he ran away from the Steen plantation and enlisted in the Union Army, taking part in the assault on Vicksburg, Mississippi. Magee claimed to have been forced to serve in both the Confederate and Union armies as a servant and laborer. No documentary evidence has been found for this. Alfred P. Andrews, founder of the Jackson Civil War Round Table and its president elect for 1965-66, helped Magee be classified as a Civil War veteran although no service records for him could be found. In March 1966, when Magee was suffering from pneumonia, Andrews helped him obtain treatment from the Mississippi Veterans Hospital.University of Southern Mississippi Collection on Sylvester Magee On Magee's purported 124th birthday, the citizens of Collins, Mississippi held a party at a country grocery store, complete with a five-layer cake and 124 candles. Governor Paul B. Johnson, Jr. declared it \\"Sylvester Magee Day\\". Many national news articles reported on Magee's life and longevity, including Time and Jet. He appeared on the Mike Douglas Show and was flown to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for another televised appearance. He was proclaimed as the oldest living United States citizen by a life insurance company and received a birthday card from President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was also recognized by president Richard M. Nixon. Jet wrote that, according to historians, \\"it would have been impossible for a person who neither reads nor writes to have related the stories of the Civil War in such detail as Magee without having served in the conflict\\". Jet quoted a historian who stated that Magee talked with \\"rare intelligence and seldom rambled\\" in telling of his participation in the Civil War. Magee had four wives, three of whom he outlived. He fathered 7 children, the last at the purported age of 107. His father reportedly lived to 123, his mother to 122. In a 1966 interview, he stated that he had never drunk alcohol, not uttered a swear word, although he smoked cigarettes for 108 years. In his later years he made a living selling automated needles and digging graves. In 1966, he divorced his wife Marie. Death and age On October 15, 1971, Sylvester Magee died in Columbia, Mississippi. His funeral was held at John the Baptist Missionary Church on October 19, 1971. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Pleasant Valley Church Cemetery in nearby Foxworth, Mississippi. In 2011, the Marion County Historical Society provided a marker. Magee's purported age of 130 has never been verified, as persons born into slavery typically lacked birth certificates.

These feelings are brought about because the individual on one hand believes in humanitarian virtues such as helping those in need, but on the other hand also believes in individualistic virtues such as working hard to improve one's life. Bernard Whitley and Mary Kite contend that this dissonance motivates people to alter their thoughts in an attempt to reduce their discomfort. Depending on the situation or context that has primed them, people will give priority to either the positive beliefs or the negative beliefs, leading to a corresponding behavioral shift known as response amplification. Theoretical framework According to Susan Fiske, there are two underlying characteristics of stigmatized groups around the world: the ideas that status predicts perceived competence and that cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Two combinations of competence and warmth produce ambivalent prejudices. The combined perception of groups as warm but incompetent leads to pitied groups, such as traditional women or older people. The combined perception of groups as competent but cold leads to envied groups, such as nontraditional women or minority entrepreneurs. Fiske uses this conception of prejudice to explain ambivalent sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and classism. Views According to Whitley and Kite, ambivalent prejudice comes from one person having both good and bad thoughts about an outgroup. The example in their book The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination talks about race and how some people often have ambivalent attitudes towards people of other races. This means that their behavior is also ambivalent: \\"sometimes it is positive, sometimes negative\\". Irwin Katz said that ambivalent prejudice only occurs when the individual becomes aware of the conflicting attitudes, and, for most people, simply coming face-to-face with someone from the outgroup can cause this. According to Katz, this conflict of attitudes can cause problems with one's self-image, because it seems as though one is not living up to all important values that one holds. This conflict can cause negative emotions, which are expressed in negative behavior. Irwin Katz and Glen Hass (1988) believed that contradicting American values are to blame for ambivalent prejudice. The first value is that hard work will always pay off and people get what they deserve, while the other is that all people are equal and that people should help the less fortunate. When this is applied to race, many people are torn. They see disadvantaged people of other races as not working hard enough to be worth as much as people of their own race, but they also understand that people of other race have a harder time financially and socially. These mixed emotions lead to ambivalence. Tara MacDonald and Mark Zanna suggested that stereotypes were to blame for ambivalent prejudice. According to MacDonald and Zanna, people can like others and respect others, the two emotions working independently of each other. When a person feels those things towards an entire group, it is because of stereotypes. Therefore, a person can like and disrespect people of other races, due to certain stereotypes, or dislike but respect the same group of people for other stereotypes. In a study testing the nature of ambivalent prejudice, Hisako Matsuo and Kevin McIntyre (2005) studied American attitudes toward immigrant groups. He proposed that ambivalent prejudice stems from two views. There is the individualistic attitude that values the Protestant work ethic, and this attitude is associated with more negative attitudes toward outgroups. The other view is an egalitarian or humanitarian one, which is associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroups. Measures Researchers use a variety of methods to measure ambivalent prejudice. The most widely used method is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for sexism created by Glick and Fiske in 1996.G. Boyle & D. Saklofske (Eds.), Measures of Personality & Social Psychological Constructs. Elsevier/Academic Press. Typical of all ingroup- outgroup relations, one group (men) has a much greater societal status. This is due to male ambivalence having three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.\\"Social psychological measures of stereotyping and prejudice\\". In G. Boyle & D. Saklofske (Eds.), Measures of Personality & Social Psychological Constructs. Elsevier/Academic Press. This assessment measures an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism. The theory of ambivalent sexism postulates that male ambivalence has three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. Women who resist traditional gender roles are punished by hostile sexism which resembles old-fashioned sexism. The theory predicts resentment of nontraditional women along each dimension: dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility. Conversely, women who cooperate with traditional gender roles and relationships evoke benevolent sexism which comprises protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy. The ASI measures sexism along each of the six dimensions that compose hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. The ASI is a self-report measure composed of 22 items, 11 for each subscale: hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. The two subscales can be calculated separately, or they can be averaged together to get an overall measure of sexism. The assessment consist of a series of statements with which respondents indicate their level of agreement on a 6-point Likert scale in which 0 = disagree strongly and 5 = agree strongly. Certain items are reversed coded so that agreement with the statement indicates lower levels of sexism and disagreement with the statement indicates higher levels of sexism. Example items from the ASI include: Below is a series of statements concerning men and women and their relationships in contemporary society that this study wrote for their subjects to evaluate. Benevolent sexism subset: *People are often truly happy in life without being romantically involved with a member of the other sex. *No matter how accomplished he is, a man is not truly complete as a person unless he has the love of a woman. *Men are complete without women. *Every man ought to have a woman whom he adores. *Women should be cherished and protected by men. *Women, as compared to men, tend to have a more refined sense of culture and good taste. *Women, compared to men, tend to have superior moral sensibility. *Many women have a quality of purity that few men possess. Hostile sexism subset: *Women exaggerate problems they have at work. *Most women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist. *Women are too easily offended. *Most women fail to appreciate fully all that men do for them. *Feminists are not seeking for women to have more power than men. *There are actually very few women who get a kick out of teasing men by seeming sexually available and then refusing male advances. Researchers use various other methods to measure different types of ambivalent prejudices. For example, the Modern Racism Scale measures aspects of ambivalent racism. Applications =Sexism= Ambivalent sexism reflects the duality of hostility towards women and the tendency for women to be rated more positively than men in surveys. Hostile sexism impacts nontraditional women who threaten male power, for example, female professionals and intellectuals, feminists, and lesbians. Conversely, benevolent sexism protects women who adhere to traditional gender roles, such as housewives and secretaries. Fiske asserts that these two forms of sexism comprise ambivalence. On the one hand, women are viewed as competent but not warm, while on the other hand, they are viewed as warm but incompetent. In the workplace, nontraditional women tend to suffer from hostile sexism since they are viewed as competitors. As benevolent sexism includes perceived obligations of protection and help, it leads to women being viewed as less worthy of hiring, training, and promoting due to the concern of them being less able to effectively manage both personal and professional. Fiske contends that when addressing bias against women, both demeaning benevolence and dangerous hostility must be account for. =Racism= Ambivalent racism depicts two contrasting reactions by whites toward blacks. These competing evaluations include hostile (antiblack) sentiments and subjectively sympathetic but paternalistic (problack) sentiments. Problack attitudes attribute black disadvantage to larger social structures and factors including discrimination, segregation, and lack of opportunities. In contrast, hostile antiblack racism, like old-fashioned racism asserts that \\"black people are unambitious, disorganized, free-riding, and do not value education.\\" Fiske states that \\"black Americans are viewed ambivalently mainly to the extent that white Americans simultaneously harbor a more subjectively positive and a more hostile attitude, which can flip from one polarity to the other, depending on individual differences in beliefs and on situational cues.\\" =Ableism= S√∂der suggests that people do not have fixed cognitive assumptions or emotions about people with disabilities. Rather, people are ambivalent, so their behavior in any given situation will depend on the context. People have two contrasting ideas about people with disabilities; people devalue disabilities while maintaining a benevolent sympathy towards disabled people. This leads to a conflict between basic values held by wider society and moral dilemmas in concrete daily interactions with people with disabilities. S√∂der proposes an ambivalence model as a better method for evaluating interactions with and attitudes about disabled people as it better captures the totality of people's sentiments. =Immigrants= Matsuo and McIntyre applied the concept of ambivalent prejudice to immigrants and refugees. They described attitudes toward immigrants and refugees as ambivalent since on the one hand they are perceived \\"sympathetically, as disadvantaged, and deserving of justice\\", but on the other hand, they are seen as \\"more likely to be involved in crime and a burden on the public system.\\" Matsuo and McIntyre used a sample survey of college students to test egalitarianism and the Protestant work ethic (PWE) and how it relates to perceptions of refugees. Participants completed survey questions regarding social contact, attitudes toward specific ethnic groups, general attitudes toward refugees, and the Humanitarianism/Protestant Work Ethic Scale. They found that the ambivalent attitudes toward refugees is based on the \\"dual maintenance of American values\\", egalitarianism and PWE. In testing the contact theory, they found that only when contact is personal and cooperative does prejudice decrease. Response amplification In order to reduce the negative feelings brought about by cognitive dissonance, people may engage in response amplification. Response amplification is defined by engaging in a more extreme response to a stigmatized individual in comparison to a similar but non-stigmatized individual than the situation calls for. This can include overdoing both positive responses and negative responses depending on whether the situation calls for a positive or negative response. For example, whites' evaluations of Blacks who are presented positively or negatively tend to be more extreme than evaluations of similar white individuals. Hass et al. (1991) had White students participate in an experiment where the student worked with either a white or black confederate to complete a task. The confederate, instructed by the experimenter, caused either the failure or successful achievement of the task. After the task, the white students rated the confederate's performance. Those who scored higher in ambivalence rated the black confederate more positively in the success condition but more negatively in the failure condition than the white confederate. David Bell and Victoria Esses (2002) conducted a study indicated that this response amplification only occurs when one believes that the ambivalent response is problematic. When ambivalent white Canadian students were given essays that emphasized the positivity or negativity of ambivalence (considering both the good and bad in a situation or person), only those in the negative condition engaged in response amplification. In addition to racial contexts, response amplification has been found in multiple contexts including in cases of able bodied people interacting with disabled individuals, women and men rating members of the opposite sex, and ratings of female feminists. Mitigation Leippe and Eisenstadt found that dissonance mediated changed may be more successful when an internal conflict already exists, that is, when individuals possess cognitive dissonance that can be a result of ambivalence. In three experiments, whites were encouraged to write essays regarding scholarship policies that would favor blacks. Writing the essay led to a more positive perception of the policy, as well as, in some cases, more positive attitudes towards blacks in general. Ambivalent people were more likely to comply with writing a positive essay than non ambivalent people. As a result of writing the essay, participants felt cognitive dissonance which led them to engage in a sort of cognitive restructuring to further reduce the dissonance. This meant engaging in more extended thinking that led to more positive beliefs about Blacks in general as well as about the specific policy. By inducing compliance in writing, they were able to induce a change in attitudes toward the target group. Fiske suggests several methods to mitigate ambivalent prejudice particularly in the context of business management. These methods mainly involve an increased awareness and recognition of the different types of prejudice. She states that not all prejudices are alike, but they do create predictable groups of stereotypes, emotional prejudices, and discriminatory tendencies. When working to counteract prejudice, the focus should be on the most stereotypically negative aspect for a group, for example, competence for older people. In addition, constructive contact, that involving cooperation and equal status in the setting, for example, between groups improves emotional intelligence.

Background  On September 8, 1943 the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces was signed. The Germans had expected and anticipated the Italian surrender, and immediately launched Operation Achse to disarm the Italian Army and take over control of the territories they occupied. The Dodecanese island group had been under Italian occupation since the Italo- Turkish War of 1912. German forces under Generalleutnant Ulrich Kleemann rushed to the central island of Rhodes, and attacked the 40,000-strong Italian garrison on 9 September, and forced it to surrender by 11 September. In doing so, they outmaneuvered the British, which had hoped by their Dodecanese Campaign to conquer the islands and use them as bases against the German- controlled Balkans. The Germans had to hold off the British and wanted to get rid of the numerous Italian prisoners as soon as possible. The Nazis considered the Italians who chose not to fight further alongside them (the majority), not as prisoners of war, but as traitors to be sent to the Germany to do forced labor.  The disaster  The Italian motor vessel Gaetano Donizetti of 3428 tons, had been confiscated by the Germans to bring arms to Rhodes, where she arrived on 19 September. The Germans then stowed some 1,600 prisoners in the cargo hold, where there was reasonably only room for 700. The Gaetano Donizetti set sail on September 22. It sailed along the east coast of Rhodes, and headed southwest, passing Lindos to the south. The Gaetano Donizetti was escorted by the German torpedo boat TA10 under Oberleutnant Jobst Hahndorff. This was the former French torpedo boat La Pomone and later the Italian FR 42. Around 01:10 am of September 23, the convoy was detected by HMS Eclipse under Commander E. Mack, who immediately opened fire. The overcrowded Gaetano Donizetti went down in seconds, taking with her the entire German crew and all Italian prisoners. The German torpedo boat TA10 was heavily damaged and later towed back to Rhodes, where it was scuttled a few days later. HMS Eclipse left the scene, not realising the extent of the tragedy that had just happened. Almost all sources agreed that Gaetano Donizetti sank with all hands, though there is an Italian report claiming that at least 32 survivors were rescued by a British destroyer. No official British records confirm this story. On February 12, 1944, another transport ship leaving from Rhodes, the SS Oria, sank in a storm, causing the death of some 4,000 Italian prisoners of war.

The climate of Asia is dry across southeast sections, with dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent experience low relief as a result of the subtropical high pressure belt; they are hot in the summer, warm to cool in winter, and may snow at higher altitudes. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air mass for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan, and the phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation modulates where in Asia landfall is more likely to occur. Temperature The Southern sections of Asia are mild to hot, while far northeastern areas such as Siberia are very cold. East Asia has a temperate climate. The highest temperature recorded in Asia was at Tirat Zvi, Israel on June 21, 1942 and at Ahvaz, Iran on June 29, 2017. West-central Asia experiences some of the largest diurnal temperature ranges on Earth. The lowest temperature measured was at Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, both in Sakha Republic of Russia on February 7, 1892 and February 6, 1933 respectively.Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation.

Precipitation A large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through the Taklamakan Desert in Western China, the Thar Desert in Western India and Iranian Plateau into the Arabian Desert in the Arabian Peninsula. Rainfall around the continent is across its southern portion from Eastern India and Northeast India across the Philippines, Indochina, Malay Peninsula, Malay Archipelago and Southern China into Korean Peninsula Taiwan and Japan due to the Monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region. The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure (a thermal low) over the warmest part of Asia.Mawsynram in Meghalaya received annually 11872 cm of rainfallNational Centre for Medium Range Forecasting.

The 38-year average at Mawsynram, Meghalaya, India is mm (467.4 in). Lower rainfall maxima are found around Turkey and central Russia. In March 2008, La Ni√±a caused a drop in sea surface temperatures around Southeast Asia by an amount of 2 ¬∞C. It also caused heavy rains over Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia.  Monsoon  Onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoons in India. The Asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems, such as the South Asian Monsoon which affects the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions, and the East Asian Monsoon which affects southern China, Korea and parts of Japan. The southwestern summer monsoons occur from June through September. The Thar Desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heats up considerably during the hot summers, which causes a low pressure area over the northern and central Indian subcontinent. To fill this void, the moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean rush into the subcontinent. These winds, rich in moisture, are drawn towards the Himalayas, creating winds blowing storm clouds towards the subcontinent. The Himalayas act like a high wall, blocking the winds from passing into Central Asia, thus forcing them to rise. With the gain in altitude of the clouds, the temperature drops and precipitation occurs. Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to of rain. The moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian subcontinent, due to its topography, become divided into two parts: the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal Branch. The Arabian Sea Branch of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the Western Ghats of the coastal state of Kerala, India, thus making the area the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon. This branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the Western Ghats with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The eastern areas of the Western Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the Western Ghats. The Bay of Bengal Branch of Southwest Monsoon flows over the Bay of Bengal heading towards northeast India and Bengal, picking up more moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The winds arrive at the Eastern Himalayas with large amounts of rain. Mawsynram, situated on the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalayas in Shillong, India, is one of the wettest places on Earth. After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turns towards the west, travelling over the Indo-Gangetic Plain at a rate of roughly 1‚Äì2 weeks per state, pouring rain all along its way. June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala. The monsoon accounts for 95% of the rainfall in India. Indian agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially like cotton, rice, oilseeds and coarse grains. A delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy, as evidenced in the numerous droughts in India in the 1990s. The monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city- dwellers as well, for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June.Official Web Site of District Sirsa, India. District Sirsa. Retrieved on 2008-12-27. However, the condition of the roads take a battering each year. Often houses and streets are waterlogged and the slums are flooded in spite of having a drainage system. This lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economical loss including damage to property and loss of lives, as evidenced in the Bombay floods of 2005. Bangladesh and certain regions of India like Assam and West Bengal, also frequently experience heavy floods during this season. And in the recent past, areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year, like the Thar Desert, have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season. The influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China's Xinjiang. It is estimated that about 70% of all precipitation in the central part of the Tian Shan Mountains falls during the three summer months, when the region is under the monsoon influence; about 70% of that is directly of \\"cyclonic\\" (i.e., monsoon-driven) origin (as opposed to \\"local convection\\"). Monsoon clouds in Calcutta Around September, with the sun fast retreating south, the northern land mass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly. With this air pressure begins to build over northern India, the Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat. This causes the cold wind to sweep down from the Himalayas and Indo- Gangetic Plain towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or Retreating Monsoon. While traveling towards the Indian Ocean, the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the Bay of Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of Sri Lanka. Cities like Madras, which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon, receives rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received by the state of Tamil Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon. In Southern Asia, the northeastern monsoons take place from December to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet. The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system develops over South-East Asia and Australasia and winds are directed toward Australia known as a monsoon trough. The East Asian monsoon affects large parts of Indochina, Philippines, China, Korea and Japan. It is characterised by a warm, rainy summer monsoon and a cold, dry winter monsoon. The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east-west except in East China where it is tilted east-northeast over Korea and Japan. The seasonal rain is known as Meiyu in China, Changma in Korea, and Bai-u in Japan, with the latter two resembling frontal rain. The onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over South China and Taiwan in early May. From May through August, the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward, beginning over Indochina and the South China Sea (May), to the Yangtze River Basin and Japan (June) and finally to North China and Korea (July). When the monsoon ends in August, the rain belt moves back to South China. Tropical cyclones World tropical cyclone activity between 1945 and 2006 Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November. The most active season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes on the island archipelago was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country. There was only one tropical cyclone which moved through the Philippines in 1958. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge position shifts due to El Nino, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience much fewer September‚ÄìNovember tropical cyclone impacts during El Ni√±o and neutral years. During El Ni√±o years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130¬∞E which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Ni√±a years, the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China.

Its common names include Balkan toadflax, broadleaf toadflax, and Dalmatian toadflax. Invasive species Linaria dalmatica is listed as a noxious weed in 12 U.S. states. It is a grassland invader native to the Mediterranean region, and it was introduced to North America in the late 1800s. It has fast-growing strong, horizontal roots, and can withstand cold, and is a problem for farms and grasslands in the interior of British Columbia. NATIVE TO/ WHEN INTRODUCED: Mediterranean region of Europe, Dalmatian toadflax is currently found in at least 34 states in the U.S. and most of the Canadian provinces. Has significantly reduced livestock production on infested pastures and rangeland. The first records of the species in Washington date back to the 1920s. HOW/WHY INTRODUCED: Cultivated as an ornamental, for use in fabric dye, and for medicinal purpose WHAT IMPACT: Dalmatian toadflax has no value as food, and crowds out valuable forage. The plants are reported to contain an iridoid glucoside and may be harmful to livestock. (though poisoning is rare because animals often avoid it) Life Cycle: Dalmatian toadflax is a perennial with extensive roots that grow up to 3 feet tall and spreads by seed and lateral roots. The overall form of the plant is narrow and upright, with multiple stems growing from a single woody base. Snapdragon-type flowers are bright yellow tinged with orange and are 1 to 1.5 inches long. Seed pods, flowers and flower buds are often present at the same time. Plants have a long flowering period, generally May to August. Mature plants can produce up to 500,000 seeds and seeds remain viable in the soil for up to 10 years. Control: Isolated plants can be dug up fairly effectively if the soil is not too hard or rocky. However, roots tend to break off and new shoots will re-sprout from any remaining lateral roots. Make sure to follow up at the site for at least a few years to watch for re-growth from the roots and emerging seedlings. If plants are in seed, carefully bag and cut off the stems before digging up the roots to minimize seed dispersal. Maintaining a healthy stand of grasses and other species will help prevent the spread of toadflax since it is most competitive in sparsely vegetated areas. Toadflax is not generally a problem in cultivated areas as regular tillage will control it. Chemical control of toadflax can be difficult. Spraying should be done in late spring when plants begin to flower or in the fall before the plants die back.

It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative features. It has a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful metaprogramming system. In June 2012, the core developers of Nemerle were hired by the Czech software development company JetBrains. The team is focusing on developing Nitra, a framework to implement extant and new programming languages. This framework will likely be used to create future versions of Nemerle. Nemerle is named after the Archmage Nemmerle, a character in the fantasy novel A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin. Features Nemerle's most notable feature is the ability to mix styles of programming that are object-oriented and functional. Programs may be structured using object-oriented concepts such as classes and namespaces, while methods can (optionally) be written in a functional style. Other notable features include: * strong type inference * a flexible metaprogramming subsystem (using macros) * full support for object- oriented programming (OOP), in the style of C#, Java, and C++ * full support for functional programming, in the style of ML, OCaml, and Haskell, with these features:  higher-order functions  pattern matching  algebraic types  local functions  tuples and anonymous types  partial application of functions The metaprogramming system allows for great compiler extensibility, embedding domain-specific languages, partial evaluation, and aspect-oriented programming, taking a high-level approach to lift as much of the burden as possible from programmers. The language combines all Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) standard features, including parametric polymorphism, lambdas, extension methods etc. Accessing the libraries included in the .NET or Mono platforms is as easy as in C#. =Type inference= def x = 1; // int def myList = List(); // generic List[T], type T is deduced from the usage in the next line myList.Add(x); // compiler deduces type of T as int making myList type of List[int] =Everything is an expression= def x = { // similar to x = 3 def y = 1; def z = 2; y + z // this last statement is a block return value }; def x = if (DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek  DayOfWeek.Monday) // if, using, try are also expressions \\"Monday\\" else \\"other day\\"; def x = try int.Parse(someString) catch {  FormatException() => 0 }; def x = returnBlock : { foreach (i in [1, 2, 3]) when (i > 2) returnBlock(true); // exit block (x = true) false // x = false }; =Tuples= def k = (1, \\"one\\"); // k : (int * string) def (a, b) = k; // a = 1, b = \\"one\\" =Pattern matching= def result = match (number) {  0 => \\"zero\\"  1 => \\"one\\"  x when x < 0 => \\"negative\\"  _ => \\"more than one\\" } =Functional types and local functions= using System.Console; // classes and modules (static classes) can be put in namespaces def next(x) { x + 1 }; // the type of x argument and other function arguments can be deduced from usage def mult(x, y) { x * y }; def fibonacci(i) {  0 => 0  1 => 1  other => fibonacci(i - 1) + fibonacci(i - 2) }; WriteLine(next(9)); // 10 similar to \\"Console.WriteLine(next(9));\\" WriteLine(mult(2, 2)); // 4 WriteLine(fibonacci(10)); // 55 = Variants = Variants (called data types or sum types in SML and OCaml) are forms of expressing data of several different kinds: variant RgbColor {  Red  Yellow  Green  Different { red : float; green : float; blue : float; } } =Metaprogramming= Nemerle's macro system allows for creating, analysing, and modifying program code during compiling. Macros can be used in the form of a method call or as a new language construct. Many constructs within the language are implemented using macros (if, for, foreach, while, using etc.). \\"if\\" macro example: macro @if (cond, e1, e2) syntax (\\"if\\", \\"(\\", cond, \\")\\", e1, Optional (\\";\\"), \\"else\\", e2) { /* <[ ]> defines an area of quasi-quotation, the Nemerle compiler transforms the code in it to an AST, such transformations are somewhat similar to an Expression compiling in C# */ <[ match ($cond : bool) {  true => $e1  _ => $e2 } ]> } // using this macro in code: def max = if (a > b) a else b; // during a compile time the upper line will be transformed to this: def max = match (a > b) {  true => a  _ => b }  IDE  Nemerle can be integrated into the integrated development environment (IDE) Visual Studio 2008. It also has a fully free IDE based on Visual Studio 2008 ShellNemerle Studio Microsoft Setup Installer can be installed after installing Visual Studio Shell 2008 Isolated (like Visual Studio Express Editions) and SharpDevelop (link to plugin source code). Nemerle can be also integrated into Visual Studio 2010 using an add-in.Visual Studio 2010 add-in Examples =Hello, World!= The traditional Hello World! can be implemented in a more C#-like fashion: class Hello { static Main () : void { System.Console.WriteLine (\\"Hello, world!\\"); } } or more simply: System.Console.WriteLine(\\"Hello, world!\\"); =Examples of macros= Macros allow generating boilerplate code with added static checks performed by the compiler. They reduce the amount of code that must be written by hand, make code generation safer, and allow programs to generate code with compiler checks, while keeping source code relatively small and readable. String formatting  The string formatting macro simplifies variables to string manipulations using $ notation: def s = $\\"The number is $i\\"; //insert the value of the variable i where $i is placed def s = $\\"$x + $y = $(x+y)\\"; // $(...) can be used to make calculations or access members Declarative code generation StructuralEquality, Memoize, json, and with are macros which generate code in compile time. Though some of them (StructuralEquality, Memoize) can look like C# attributes, during compiling, they will be examined by the compiler and transformed to appropriate code using logic predefined by their macros. [StructuralEquality] // Implement IEquatable[Sample] .Net interface using by element comparison equality. class Sample { [Memoize] // remember first evaluation result public static SomeLongEvaluations() : int { MathLib.CalculateNthPrime(10000000) } [DependencyProperty] // WPF dependency property public DependencyPropertySample { get; set; } public static Main() : void { /* syntax macro \\"json\\" generates code: JObject.Object([(\\"a\\", JValue.Number(SomeLongEvaluations())), (\\"b\\", JValue.Number(SomeLongEvaluations() + 1))]) */ def jObject = json { a: SomeLongEvaluations(); b: (SomeLongEvaluations() + 1)} // object initialization macro \\"<-\\" is development of C# curly brackets object initialization def k = Diagnostics.Process() <\\\\- { StartInfo <\\\\- // can init inner objects properties without ctor call { FileName = \\"calc.exe\\"; UseShellExecute = true; } Exited += () => WriteLine(\\"Calc done\\"); // events and delegates } ReadLine(); } } Database accessibility Using Nemerle macros for SQL you can write: ExecuteReaderLoop(\\"SELECT firstname, lastname FROM employee WHERE firstname = $myparm\\", dbcon, { WriteLine ($\\"Name: $firstname $lastname\\") }); instead of string sql = \\"SELECT firstname, lastname FROM employee WHERE firstname = :a\\"; using (NpgsqlCommand dbcmd = new NpgsqlCommand (sql, dbcon, dbtran)) { dbcmd.Parameters.Add(\\"a\\", myparm); using (NpgsqlReader reader = dbcmd.ExecuteReader()) { while(reader.Read()) { var firstname = reader.GetString (0); var lastname = reader.GetString (1); Console.WriteLine (\\"Name: {0} {1}\\", firstname, lastname) } } } and this is not just hiding some operations in a library, but additional work performed by the compiler to understand the query string, the variables used there, and the columns returned from the database. The ExecuteReaderLoop macro will generate code roughly equivalent to what you would have to type manually. Moreover, it connects to the database at compilation time to check that your SQL query really makes sense. New language constructs With Nemerle macros you can also introduce some new syntax into the language: macro ReverseFor (i, begin, body) syntax (\\"ford\\", \\"(\\", i, \\";\\", begin, \\")\\", body) { <[ for ($i = $begin; $i >= 0; $i) $body ]> } defines a macro introducing the \`ford (EXPR ; EXPR) EXPR\` syntax and can be used like ford (i ; n) print (i); =Nemerle with ASP.NET= Nemerle can be either embedded directly into ASP.NET: <%@ Page Language=\\"Nemerle\\" %> Please enter your name: ...Or stored in a separate file and entered with a single line: <%@ Page Language=\\"Nemerle\\" Src=\\"test.n\\" Inherits=\\"Test\\" %> =PInvoke= Nemerle can take advantage of native platform libraries. The syntax is very similar to C#'s and other .NET languages. Here is the simplest example: using System; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; class PlatformInvokeTest { [DllImport(\\"msvcrt.dll\\")] public extern static puts(c : string) : int; [DllImport(\\"msvcrt.dll\\")] internal extern static _flushall() : int; public static Main() : void { _ = puts(\\"Test\\"); _ = _flushall(); } } References Further readingPublications about Nemerle in RSDN Magazine, Russian official science magazine  Presentation \\"Nemerle is notable\\" by Denis Rystsov * Article \\"Unconventional languages for unconventional supercomputers\\" by Andrey Adinetz External links *GitHub project and repository (new development) *Google Code project and repository (old development) *Nemerle Forum *Nemerle presentation on Microsoft Research SSCLI RFP II Capstone 2005 workshop *Nemerle at 99 Bottles of Beer Programming languages Procedural programming languages .NET programming languages Object-oriented programming languages ML programming language family Programming languages created in 2003 2003 software High-level programming languages ","title":"Nemerle"},{"id":"30883064","text":"Tito Minniti Tito Minniti (1909 ‚Äì 26 December 1935) was an Italian pilot who was killed after he was captured by Ethiopians during the Second Italo- Abyssinian War in 1935 near Degehabur. His death and alleged torture became an atrocity story proffered by the Italian government to justify their use of mustard gas against Ethiopian civilians. Minniti was posthumously decorated with the Italian Gold Medal of Valor.Tito Minniti's Military Gold Medal Life The Romeo Ro.1 airplane used by Tito Minniti Tito Minniti was born near Reggio Calabria, Italy in 1909. He became a military pilot of the Regia Aeronautica in 1933. He had attained the rank of Lieutenant when he volunteered to fight in Ethiopia in 1935. He flew a number of missions over enemy territory. On 26 December 1935 Minniti was flying a reconnaissance mission with an observer, Sergeant Livio Zannoni. He was forced to land behind enemy lines, probably due to engine trouble. Minnitti and Zannoni survived apparently uninjured, but were soon challenged by Ethiopians. What happened next is disputed. Both men were killed, but according to Rainer Baudendistel, \\"it was never established whether they died defending themselves or were killed after surrender\\".Rainer Baudendistel, Between bombs and good intentions: the Red Cross and the Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935-1936, Berghahn Books, 2006, p.239; 131-2. Google books link The only officially recorded testimony of the event, given by an Egyptian paramedic, asserted with details that Minniti was tortured and murdered by Ethiopian troops. Atrocity version According to one version of events, Minniti and Zannoni fought the Army of the Ethiopian Empire soldiers who approached. Minniti attacked them with the aircraft's machine gun, killing some of them. Eventually he ran out of ammunition and was forced to surrender. Zannoni was killed, but Minniti was taken to the village of Bolali. Italian propaganda later declared that Minniti was subject to torture and mutilation before his death. This version of events relied on the assertions of an attach√© of the Egyptian Red Cross, Abdel Mohsein El Uisci, who later testified to the League of Nations and stated that the severed head and feet of Minniti were carried to the towns of Degehabur, Jijiga and Harar. El Uisci testified: The leader of the killers, Manghestu, took the genitals and told El Uisci that he intended to flay Minniti's body to make cigarette paper from the skin. El Uisci, again in Dagabur, said he had also witnessed the torture of another Italian soldier, who was mutilated, impaled and then transported on a stake, which pierced a metal bar that was lying on the back of two camels.Ferdinando Pedriali, L'Aeronautica italiana nelle guerre coloniali, p. 60 Castration of defeated enemies was a tradition in Ethiopia as was the taking of body parts as trophies.Reidulf Knut Molvaer, Socialization and social control in Ethiopia, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1995, p. 104. Italy had already raised the practice at the League of Nations, as part of its justification for the invasion.George W. Baer, Italy, Ethiopia, and the League of Nations (Hoover Press, 1976), p. 106. Isamael Daoud, El Uisci's superior, denied the truth of his account of events. The Italians argued that Daoud was in no position to dispute the accuracy of the story, as he was in Egypt at the time.Colloredo Pierluigi. I Pilastri del Romano Impero, p. 78 Kamel Hamed and Labib Salamah, two other members of El Uisci's paramedic team in Ethiopia, supported El Uisci's assertions. In 1937, journalist and historian Indro Montanelli interviewed one of the Ethiopians who killed Minniti, who confirmed El Uisci's account.Montanelli, Indro. Guerra e pace in Africa Orientale, p. 45 Ethiopian version The Ethiopian authorities asserted that the two Italians had been killed not by Ethiopian troops but by local people, angered by the bombing of their villages. The local Ethiopian commander Dejazmach Nasibu Emmanual sent a messenger to the Italian General Rodolfo Graziani, giving the Ethiopian version of events and assuring him that prisoners were being treated in accordance with international law. The messenger was arrested, and Graziani did not reply. Nasibu repeated the Ethiopian version in radio broadcasts. Italian response Instead, Graziani expressed outrage at the murder and ordered immediate bombings of Ethiopian troops. Two Red Cross camp-hospitals in the area were also hit. He even ordered leaflets to be dropped, saying: \\"You have beheaded one of our airmen, infringing all human and international laws, under which prisoners are sacred and deserve respect. You will get what you deserve. Graziani\\". The use of mustard gas was considered legitimate because of the alleged atrocity. After the war, the bodies of Minniti and Zannoni were found 200 m from the downed aircraft, but the remains were too decayed and damaged by wild animals for the manner of their death to be determined. Aftermath Mussolini promoted Minniti as a great Italian Royal Air Force hero. A heroic version of his last hours was circulated that the plane was forced down by enemy anti-aircraft fire rather than by mechanical problems. Undaunted, the wounded Minniti still managed to land safely and hold off the Ethiopians for as long as he could, to protect his incapacitated sergeant. The citation for his award stated that he fought \\"a titanic and indomitable struggle. Overwhelmed by the number and ferocity of the barbarian enemy he gloriously lost his life: a shining example of high military virtues, proud spirit of sacrifice and indomitable Italian values\\". Flags in Minniti's hometown were flown at half-mast. His father was quoted saying, \\"I have given a son to the fatherland in the World War and I do not regret giving the fatherland another. For the greatness of Italy I am ready to offer the lives of my other four!\\"Time, \\"War: Ethiopia's Lusitania?\\", Monday, Jan. 13, 1936. The Reggio Calabria Airport, near his birthplace, was named after Minniti and still bears his name. The Italian sculptor Arturo Martini created a memorial entitled \\"Tito Minniti Hero of Africa\\" in 1936, depicting his headless naked body tied to the tree in cruciform pose. It is preserved in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome.Henry Moore Institute, Scultura Lingua Morta, 2003. The legitimacy of the Italian response was much debated. In 1937, the antifascist writer Giuseppe Antonio Borgese gave his own version of events (he was later labeled as \\"traitor\\" because of this by the Italian Army in Ethiopia) that Graziani merely seized on the incident to excuse his actions: Minniti is still commemorated in his hometown every year as a military hero.

History Early Davis sewing machines, known as their \\"Vertical Feed\\" machines, did not use the conventional four motion feed, as invented by Allen B. Wilson and used in most other machines. These machines have no feed dogs at all. Instead, they have two presser feet, one of which, along with the needle bar, moves the cloth while the needle is still through the cloth. The other, larger, presser foot is used to hold the cloth stationary while the needle lifts out of the cloth and moves forward to get ready for the next stitch. While Davis called this mechanism their \\"Vertical Feed\\", sewing machines with similar mechanisms are now known as \\"walking foot\\" machines. Closeup of the vertical feed mechanism on an 1877 Davis sewing machine Later Davis machines used a more conventional feed mechanism, with a stationary presser foot and feed dogs. Davis called them \\"underfeed\\" machines. On Oct 18, 1881, Davis Sewing Machine Co., was awarded US Pat. 248,449 for improvements over existing shuttle designs. Page 1 of patent Around 1892, Davis started manufacturing bicycles. The Dayton Daily News indicated that the bicycle business was so successful that Davis gradually phased out production of sewing machines.

Four large Tuscan columns hold up the porch roof on the Greek Revival style building. After it was completed the seat of county government moved to West Point. From 1843 to 1845 the Fort Madison courthouse was rented out. County voters chose Fort Madison as the county seat in an election in 1845, and the courthouse has been used for county business since that time. with The Iowa General Assembly established Keokuk as the second county seat in 1848, making Lee County the only Iowa county that has more than one courthouse.

The series debuted in the July 2008 issue of Ribon. It ran for a total of three chapters, ending in the September 2008 issue. Mistress Fortune was published in a single tank≈çbon in Japan by Shueisha on December 25, 2008. Characters =ESPers= Kisaki Tachikawa is a 14-year-old second year junior high student who moonlights as the ESPer Fortune Tiara. Kisaki is in love with Giniro Hashiba. She is the only known ESPer to possess the special Planet Photon electromagnetic waves. * Giniro Hashiba is a 14-year-old genius ESPer, known as Fortune Quartz. He is also a second year junior high school student, but at a different school than Kisaki. When Giniro's ESP powers first appeared at age 5, they were so strong that they blew up his home and family; His father and older sister died and his mother has been in a coma for the past 9 years since the beginning of the story. Due to those events he now lives at PSI headquarters and claims he has a debt to Commander Hakase. He claims that Maron and Meroko (from Tanemura's Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne and Full Moon o Sagashite respectively) are the idols of his heart. Giniro admits that he is in love with Kisaki in the third chapter. * Gunjo Hakase is the commander of PSI and a known slacker. =Other Humans= Kagami Ichigaya is Kisaki's best friend and classmate. Kagami is also the only one outside of PSI to know that Kisaki is an ESPer. She is one of the girls Ebeko pulls into her tornado. * Kisaki's mother is another of the women pulled into Ebeko's tornado. She is often seen asking Kisaki to do her homework. She is extremely excited when Hakase tells her that Kisaki has been offered an opportunity to go to America, though she doesn't know why Kisaki has been offered the opportunity, as she is unaware that Kisaki is an ESPer. * Giniro's mother has been in a coma for the past nine years, due to the events that occurred when Giniro's ESP powers first appeared. Kisaki discovers that they are able to communicate with her using their ESP powers of telepathy. * Nancy Thistlethwaite is a member of PSI in America who asks Kisaki to help them out with an EBE at their American headquarters in San Francisco, California. The character's name comes from Tanemura's English editor at Viz Media. =Ebes= Ebes (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities) are aliens, who are presumed to be trying to invade Earth, that come in all different shapes and sizes. There are at least 5 different levels of power for the Ebes. * Ebeko is one of the first Ebes shown in the manga; She is originally a Level 5 Ebe and is the only Ebe seen to be able to communicate with humans verbally. She was given to Kisaki by her friend, Kagami, supposedly as a plush toy that was to grant Kisaki luck in her love life. Ebeko could read thoughts and granted Kisaki's wish for all the other girls in the world to disappear so that Giniro would only look at her. After Ebeko was stopped and subsequently captured, she started working with Mistress Fortune and the PSI group in exchange for her freedom. On her first mission with Mistress Fortune, she was named Ebeko by Giniro. She complained that no thought was put into her name and that she wanted to be named something like Maron or Meroko (both from other Tanemura manga). Media =Manga= Other than the three main chapter of the series, there were three side stories created by Tanemura. The first ran in the 2008 Summer Special edition of Ribon, the second in the November 2008 issue of Ribon magazine, and the third in the 2008 Winter Special edition of Ribon alongside a Gentlemen's Alliance oneshot. The only volume of Mistress Fortune containing all three main chapters and two of the side stories was released on December 25, 2008. Shueisha included a double-sided poster in the first editions. Viz Media announced a license for the series at their 2010 Anime Expo panel. The series is also licensed by Tokyopop in Germany and Panini Comics in Italy. =Vomic= An internet vomic (a portmanteau of the words voice and comic) in four parts covering the first 2 chapters of the series was created and published by Shueisha. The vomic featured Ai Matayoshi as Kisaki, Kenichi Suzumura as Giniro, Junji Majima as Gunjo Hakase, Chiwa Sait≈ç as Ebeko, and Ayumi Fujimura as Kagami. The vomic was first announced in the September 2008 issue of Ribon. Reception The English version published by Viz Media received generally positive reviews. Leroy Douresseaux of the Comic Book Bin gave the volume a B+, noting that it is, \\"It is lighthearted fun as only Tanemura can do it.\\" Carlo Santos of Anime News Network noted that it was too short, but that, \\"it's still a surprisingly fun take on the ESPer action- adventure genre‚Äîand the handful of in-jokes for American readers nudge it up to a B.\\" Matthew Warner of Mania.com also gave the volume a B, calling it a \\"tad generic,\\" but an \\"interesting read.\\" Karen Maeda of Sequential Tart was not so favorable, giving the volume a 5 out of 10 and suggesting that readers stick to other Tanemura works, as Mistress Fortune can be \\"too unrealistic and weird to want to bother with.\\" The School Library Journal listed Mistress Fortune as one of \\"39 Graphic Novels that Kids Can't Resist,\\" suggesting it for grades 6-8.

A surveillance video later aired by KTRK that was leaked by an employee of a storage lot adjacent to the location of the beating after a short police chase. On June 13, 2012, having just come off of probation the preceding April, Holley was again arrested, this time by the Harris County Sheriff's Office, along with three others as they tried to evade police. The four were seen running out of a northwest Harris County home with items and driving off. A witness reported the break-in and gave 911 a description and the license plate number to the vehicle.

Quanell X claims was that Holley was \\"off his medications for mental illness and is a special education student\\" and does not comprehend the consequences.

Capital murder charge  Chad Holley, the man at the center of a 2010 beating probe involving Houston police, has been charged with capital murder.

Police said Trejo-Gonzalez was shot around 9:45 pm at East Crosstimbers near Fulton on Wednesday, September 21. HPD called it a robbery gone bad, and said the victim was walking from the parking lot of his apartment when he was attacked. The suspect, who was unknown to police at the time, was said to have driven off in a white low-rider style truck or SUV, driven by an accomplice. Holley has now been identified as Trejo-Gonzalez's alleged killer. He is the one police suspect of shooting Trejo-Gonzalez during the scuffle.

Divisions According to a report on the country written in 1773 by Brian Edwards, his lands were divided into two population groups, the \\"Samboes\\" (Miskito Sambu) who were mixed indigenous and African, and \\"pure Indians\\" (Miskito Tawira); and was further divided into four domains: the domains of the king and the general in the north and west, inhabited by \\"Samboes\\" and the domains of the governor and admiral inhabited by \\"pure Indians.\\"Brian Edwards, \\"Some Account of the British Settlements on the Musquito Shore\\" (10 November 1773) in The History, Civil and Commercial of the British West Indies (5 vols., London, 1819) 5: 210 (a separate pagination as an Appendix). British settlers first reported this fourfold division in 1766 and it is possible that George created or consolidated it.\\"Inhabitants of the Mosquito Shore to the late Earl of Chatham in 1766 (31 May 1766), in Defense of Robert Hodgson (London, 1779) Appendices, p. 5 (a separate pagination). Population Edwards also observed that in 1770, George's kingdom had a population that he estimated numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 fighting men,Edwards, History 5: 210 Appendix. which at a ratio of four civilians to one fighter would make 28,000 and 40,000 people. In addition to Miskitos, the population included 1,400 British inhabitants, of which 136 where white, 112 of mixed race and about 600 slaves, mostly concentrated around the British settlement of Black River, but other concentrations were at Cabo Gracias a Dios and at Bluefields.Edwards, History 5: 207-208 (Appendix). Political Developments during his Reign One of the tensions within the Miskito domain was that between the Zambu and Tawira, since the Zambus controlled the north and west (primarily in modern-day Honduras) and were vigorously pushing their authority southward into Tawira domains (which lay mostly in today's Nicaragua). This pattern was resisted by Dilson, who was the Admiral and thus controlled the extreme southern parts of the Miskito domain. In June 1769 the Zambu Admiral, Israel Sella, warned the king that Dilson's brother, Jaspar Hall along with two \\"Mosquito men\\" named John Chord and Vizer visited the Spanish at Cartago and received gifts as a part of a plan to displace the English from the shore.Inhabitants of the Mosquito Shore to William Trelawny, 7 October 1769 in Defense of Robert Hodgson, appendix, pp. 17-18. Spanish officials declared that Dilson was the \\"governor of the Miskito nation.\\"\\"Titulo de gobernador de la Nacion Mosquitia...\\" 1769, in Leon Fernandez, ed, Colecci√≥n de documentos para la historia de Costa Rica (15 vols, 1907) 10: 23-25. The emissaries were called Yasparal, Yani and Versa (p. 24). Dilson also involved Briton, the Governor, who also controlled a Tawira population, in his cause. At the same time, Tempest, the Zambu General traveled to England attempt to persuade the king of England to separate the administration of the English living in Central America from Jamaica,Inhabitants of Mosquito Shore in Defense of Robert Hodgson, p. 5 a move which led George to believe he was plotting his overthrow.Olien, \\"Miskito Kings,\\" p. 211.

George also gave many generous land grants to Englishmen to establish plantations. He gave many around Black River, their largest settlement, but also gave them around Bluefields, which was in land ruled by the Tawira Admiral, a definite move to establish his authority throughout the Miskito Kingdom. Among these grants were ones given to Dr Charles Irwin, who sought the assistance of Olaudah Equiano to recruit slaves in 1776. In exchange, the Tawira Admiral, Dilson II continued negotiations with the Spanish.Karl Offen, \\"The Miskitu Kingdom: Landscape and the Emergence of a Miskitu Ethnic Identity, Northeastern Nicaragua and Honduras, 1600-1800\\" (PhD dissertation, University of Texas at Austin, 1999) pp. 409-411.

It honors Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, a prominent American naval officer and member of the Du Pont family. The fountain replaced a statue of Du Pont that was installed in 1884. Designed by Henry Bacon and sculpted by Daniel Chester French, the fountain was dedicated in 1921. Prominent guests at the dedication ceremony included First Lady Florence Harding, Secretary of War John W. Weeks and Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby. The fountain is one of eighteen Civil War monuments collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The marble fountain, which is adorned with three allegorical sculptures, rests on a concrete base and is surrounded by an open plaza. The fountain and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. History =Background= In 1871, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began constructing Dupont Circle, which at the time was called Pacific Circle since it was the western boundary of the city's residential areas. On February 25, 1882, Congress renamed the circle and authorized a memorial to Samuel Francis Du Pont (1803‚Äì1865) to honor his services during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and Civil War. He played a large role in the modernization of the Navy, and during the Civil War he was responsible for making the Union blockade effective against the Confederacy, though his failed attempt to attack Charleston in 1863 tarnished his career record. The bronze statue was sculpted by Launt Thompson and dedicated on December 20, 1884, at a cost of $20,500. Attendees at the ceremony included President Chester A. Arthur, Senator Thomas F. Bayard, Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Philip Sheridan. The circle was landscaped with exotic plants and hundreds of trees. In the early 20th century, members of the prominent Du Pont family wanted a memorial of greater artistic value and lobbied for a replacement. The family had always disliked the statue and by 1909, the base of the statue had begun to sink and tilt, resulting in jokes being made that Du Pont and sailors were alcoholics. Senator Willard Saulsbury, Jr.'s wife, who was a niece of Du Pont, led efforts to replace the statue. The family asked that no government funds be used for the new memorial and that the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) approve the design. On February 26, 1917, Congress approved the replacement of the statue and insisted on construction beginning within three years. Installation of the fountain in 1920. The Du Pont family chose architect Henry Bacon and sculptor Daniel Chester French to design a fountain that reflected the Beaux-Arts and neoclassical styles that were popular in the neighborhood at the time, such as the Patterson Mansion, located on the northeast edge of the circle. Bacon is best known for designing the Lincoln Memorial while French's best known work is the statue of Abraham Lincoln inside the memorial. French's other works in Washington, D.C. include the Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain, the First Division Monument and the Thomas Gallaudet Memorial. The total cost of the commission was $77,521. The CFA approved the design in 1917 and work began on the fountain shortly thereafter. Congress wanted recognition for its earlier attempt to honor Du Pont, so the inscription on the fountain had to include the fact that a statue erected by Congress was replaced. An early model included plans for a fountain emitting water at the top, but this wasn't incorporated into the final design. The fountain was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers, who also carved French's statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial. The contractor was the George A. Fuller Company, whose other projects include the Flatiron Building and the Plaza Hotel in New York City. In 1920, the statue was moved to Rockford Park in Wilmington, Delaware, the hometown of the Du Pont family. Later that year, the fountain was installed using pipes that were placed in 1877 for a potential fountain that had never been built. After the installation, mature trees and thick vegetation were planted in the surrounding park. =Dedication= The dedication ceremony in 1921. The fountain was formally dedicated the afternoon of May 17, 1921. The ceremony, which was supervised by Lieutenant Colonel Clarence O. Sherrill, was described as \\"simple, yet impressive.\\" A temporary stand decorated with flags and shields was built for prominent guests including First Lady Florence Harding, Secretary of War John W. Weeks and Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby. Chairs were placed along the walkways surrounding the fountain and sailors served as ushers for the event. While invited guests were being seated, the Navy Band performed music. Following the concert, members of the public were allowed to enter the area and soon filled the surrounding park. The invocation was given by Episcopal bishop Alfred Harding followed by presentation of the colors while the band performed \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". The cloth screens concealing the fountain were then removed by Du Pont's granddaughter, Sophie Du Pont Ford, and the band performed the national anthem and \\"Narcissus\\" by Ethelbert Nevin. The fountain was formally presented by Rear Admiral Purnell Frederick Harrington, who had served alongside Du Pont. Weeks received the fountain as a gift from the Du Pont family on behalf of the government. A speech was then given by Denby who praised Du Pont's services to his country. He stated: \\"Du Pont's hereditary background had justified the hope so meritoriously fulfilled in that officer's career, while his service as a midshipman on the then active Constitution must have proved an inspiration for his later activities.\\" Denby also praised Du Pont's attitude toward his fellow sailors and his willingness to put the country's needs above his own. He concluded his speech by noting how proud the Navy was of the new memorial and expressed hopes that it would always be well maintained. Following Denby's speech, three young girls that were descendants of Du Pont, Ann Andrews, Emily Du Pont and Mary Harvey, placed laurel wreaths in the fountain water. The ceremony concluded with the band performing \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.\\" =Later history= The fountain was a frequent target for vandals who would repeatedly break off fingers or hands from the sculptures. New hands were later carved and attached to the sculptures. In 1948, the fountain was temporarily removed when a streetcar underpass was built beneath Dupont Circle. When it was moved back to its original location two years later, the fountain's pumping system was replaced. When the new system was installed, workers forgot to connect the pipes to the fountain. The issue was corrected the following year and the fountain became operational. The fountain is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C. that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. It is one of the few Civil War monuments that is a not an equestrian sculpture. The others are the Stephenson Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, Nuns of the Battlefield, the Peace Monument, and statues of Admiral David G. Farragut, Albert Pike and General John A. Rawlins. The fountain is designated a contributing property to the Massachusetts Avenue Historic District, listed on the NRHP on October 22, 1974, and the Dupont Circle Historic District, listed on the NRHP on July 21, 1978. In the late 1990s, the fountain was restored by sculptor Constantine Seferlis. The fountain and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. Design and location Water falling over the figure representing the Sea. The fountain sits in the center of Dupont Circle, a park, traffic circle and neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. The park is located at the convergence of 19th Street, P Street, Connecticut Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue NW. The double-tiered, white marble fountain rests on a concrete base. The upper basin of the fountain, which is approximately high and wide and weighs 15 tons, is supported by an 8-ton shaft adorned with three allegorical figures, the Arts of Ocean Navigation. The figures, which are approximately tall and wide and weigh 12 tons, represent the Sea, the Stars and the Wind. The Sea is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder with her left hand. Her left foot rests on a dolphin. The Stars is a nude female figure with long hair holding a globe in her left hand and is faced downward. The Wind is a nude male figure draped with a ship sail. He is holding a conch shell with his left hand to use as a horn and is facing right. The water pours over the upper basin into a large lower basin that is approximately tall. The inscription on the outer rim of the lower basin states: \\"THIS MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN REPLACES A STATUE ERECTED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES IN RECOGNITION OF HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICES. SAMUEL FRANCIS DUPONT UNITED STATES NAVY 1803 ‚Äì 1865.\\" The circular concrete base features four sets of three steps that lead to the surrounding plaza. Six radial paths corresponding to the surrounding streets lead from the plaza to the edges of the park.

Inputs The major input to the IPN arrives via the fasciculus retroflex from the medial habenula. This pathway presents the IPN with several excitatory neurotransmitters including ACh and Substance P. Other brain regions that project to the Interpeduncular nucleus include: the Nucleus of diagonal band, the dorsal Tegmentum, the Raphe nuclei, the Central grey, and the Locus coeruleus. Outputs The major output pathways are inhibitory and project to the dorsal Tegmental area, the Periaqueductal gray and also the Raphe nuclei. In addition, output is sent to the following: the mediodorsal nucleus of the Thalamus, the lateral Habenula, the Septal nuclei, the anterior Mammillary nuclei, the Nucleus of diagonal band, the Preoptic area, the Ventral tegmental area, and in some species the dorsal and/or lateral Hypothalamus. Function The Interpeduncular nucleus is thought to have a broad inhibitory effects on many other brain regions. IPN activity is linked with decreased dopamine release and utilization from dopamine producing regions . The Interpeduncular nucleus is implicated with a role in the regulation of Rapid eye movement sleep . Activation of the GAD2 expressing sub-population of the IPN produced the physical symptoms of nicotine withdrawal suggesting that the misfunction of this region may be an active component of withdrawal.

It has a better capability than electromyography for detecting slow or direct currents. The magnitude of the MMG signal is in the scale of pico (10‚àí12) to femto (10‚àí15) Tesla (T). Miniaturizing MMG offers a prospect to modernize the bulky SQUID to wearable miniaturized magnetic sensors. Two key drivers for the development of the MMG method: 1) poor spatial resolution of the EMG signals when recorded non-invasively on the skin where state-of-the- art EMG measurements are even using needle recording probes, which is possible to accurately assess muscle activity but painful and limited to tiny areas with poor spatial sampling points; 2) poor biocompatibility of the implantable EMG sensors due to the metal-tissue interface. The MMG sensors have the potential to address both shortcomings concurrently because: 1) the size of magnetic field reduces significantly with the distance between the origin and the sensor, thereby with MMG spatial resolution is uplifted; and 2) the MMG sensors do not need electrical contacts to record, hence if fully packaged with biocompatible materials or polymers, they can improve long-term biocompatibility. MMG using conventional SQUIDs[1] (top) and miniaturised implantable magnetic sensors[2] (bottom). History At the early 18th century, the electric signals from living tissues have been investigated. These researchers have promoted many innovations in healthcare especially in medical diagnostic. Some example is based on electrical signals produced by human tissues, including Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG). Besides, with the development of technologies, the biomagnetic measurement from the human body, consisting of Magnetocardiogram (MCG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Magnetomyogram (MMG), provided clear evidence that the existence of the magnetic fields from ionic action currents in electrically active tissues can be utilized to record activities. For the first attempt, David Cohen used a point-contact superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in a shielded room to measure the MCG. They reported that the sensitivity of the recorded MCG was orders of magnitude higher than the previously recorded MCG. The same researcher continued this MEG measurement by using a more sensitive SQUID magnetometer without noise averaging. He compared the EEG and alpha rhythm MEG recorded by both normal and abnormal subjects. It is shown that the MEG has produced some new and different information provided by the EEG. Because the heart can produce a relatively large magnetic field compared to the brain and other organs, the early biomagnetic field research originated from the mathematical modelling of MCG. Early experimental studies also focused on the MCG. In addition, these experimental studies suffer from unavoidable low spatial resolution and low sensitivity due to the lack of sophisticated detection methods. With advances in technology, research has expanded into brain function, and preliminary studies of evoked MEGs began in the 1980s. These studies provided some details about which neuronal populations were contributing to the magnetic signals generated from the brain. However, the signals from single neurons were too weak to be detected. A group of over 10,000 dendrites is required as a group to generate a detectable MEG signal. At the time, the abundance of physical, technical, and mathematical limitations prevented quantitative comparisons of theories and experiments involving human electrocardiograms and other biomagnetic records. Due to the lack of an accurate micro source model, it is more difficult to determine which specific physiological factors influence the strength of MEG and other biomagnetic signals and which factors dominate the achievable spatial resolution. In the past three decades, a great deal of research has been conducted to measure and analyze the magnetic field generated by the flow of ex vivo currents in isolated axons and muscle fibers. These measurements have been supported by some complex theoretical studies and the development of ultra-sensitive room temperature amplifiers and neuromagnetic current probes. Nowadays, cell-level magnetic recording technology has become a quantitative measurement technique for operating currents. Nowadays, the MMG signals can become an important indicator in medical diagnosis, rehabilitation, health monitoring and robotics control. Recent advances in technology have paved the way to remotely and continuously record and diagnosis individuals‚Äô disease of the muscle and the peripheral nerve. Motivated by exploring the electrophysiological behavior of the uterus prior to childbirth, MMG was used mainly on health monitoring during pregnancy. In addition, the MMG has the potential to be used in the rehabilitation such as the traumatic nerve injury, spinal cord lesion, and entrapment syndrome. Miniaturized MMG The magnitude of the MMG signals is lower than that of the heart and the brain. The minimum spectral density could reach limit of detection (LOD) of hundreds of fT/‚àöHz at low frequencies especially between 10 Hz and 100 Hz. In a seminal work of Cohen and Gilver in 1972, they discovered and recorded MMG signals using Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). They led the development of MMG until now since it is the most sensitive device at moment with the femto-Tesla limit of detection (LOD), and possibly achieve atto-Tesla LOD with averaging. The state-of-the-art MMG measurement is dominated by SQUIDs. Nonetheless, their ultra-high cost and cumbersome weight limit the spread of this magnetic sensing technique. In the last several years, optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have been rapidly developed to study the innervation of the hand nerves and muscles as proof-of-concept investigations. The OPMs with small physical size have been improved their LODs significantly during recent years, especially from competing manufacturers e.g. QuSpin Inc., FieldLine Inc. and Twinleaf. Below 100 fT/‚àöHz sensitivity has been achieved with OPMs. The MMG has not been a common method yet mainly due to its small magnitude, which can be easily affected by the magnetic noise in surrounding. For instance, the amplitude of the Earth magnetic field is about five million times larger and environmental noise from power lines can reach a level of nano-Tesla. Additionally, current experiments based on SQUIDs and OPMs for MMG sensing are conducted in heavily-shielded rooms, which are expensive and bulky for personal daily use. Consequently, the development of miniaturised, low- cost and room temperature biomagnetic sensing methods would constitute an important step towards the wider appreciation of biomagnetism. A high- performance Hall sensor has been successfully performed with its integrated readout circuit in CMOS technology. However, Hall sensors require a highly stable DC power supply to excite the Hall effect and a complex interface circuit to process collected weak Hall voltages under surrounding noise. Recently miniaturised tunneling magnetoresistive sensors as well as magnetoelectric sensors have been proposed for the future of the MMG in the form of wearable devices. They are CMOS compatible and their sensor output can be readout by an analogue front-end. The miniaturized TMR sensor could be an effective alternative for future MMG measurements with relatively low operating costs.

She was acquired. 2 April 1993, by the United States Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration and renamed MV Cape Victory on 2 April 1994 and assigned to the Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, 19 August 1994. When activated Cape Victory is one of the Maritime Administration's 31 Roll-on/Roll-off Reserve Force Ships assigned to the US Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) Sealift Program Office. Cape Victory is nested at the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Beaumont, Texas, in ROS-5 status, with a 10-man maintenance crew on board. History Upon the conclusion of its reflagging, Cape Victory entered the Ready Reserve Force in Reduced Operating Status ‚Äì 4 (ROS-4) on 2 September 1994. The vessel is required to be ready for tender to COMSC within 96 hours of an activation notice. The ten (10) person ROS crew performs continuous maintenance in order to maintain the vessel in class with the American Bureau of Shipping and fully certificated by the USCG. Within seven days of entering the RRF, on 9 September 1994, the MV Cape Victory loaded cargo at Wilmington, NC and departed for Port-au-Prince, Haiti via Guantanamo, Cuba. MV Cape Victory supported Operation Uphold Democracy, a peace keeping mission, for 94 days before returning to Beaumont, TX. Following her return from Uphold Democracy she returned to her layberth. MV Cape Victory was activated on 4 December 1998, for a test of her readiness mission. The vessel was fully operational when her sail orders were changed and she supported the humanitarian relief effort to Central America in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. Cape Victory transported construction equipment and relief supplies for 23 days, returning to her layberth. The Cape Victory was activated on 17 January 2003 for Operation Iraqi Freedom and loaded cargo from the 4th Infantry Division at the Port of Beaumont. The ship spent a total of 110 days in Full Operating Service (FOS) discharging cargo in Kuwait and returning to Beaumont on 9 May 2003. Cape Victory was active moving military equipment to Kuwait and back until the latter part of 2005. In 2005 Cape Victory provided relieve to victims of Hurricane Rita in Beaumont, Texas. Cape Victory is currently located in the Beaumont Reserve Fleet in Reduced Operating Status with a crew of 10. Keystone Shipping Company is the Ship Manager. Cape Victory moved to the MARAD Reserve Fleet in Beaumont, Texas in August 2009 along with her sister ship the Cape Vincent saving the US Government approximately $1,000,000.00 per year. Cargo Capability From June through November 1998, Cape Victory and her sister vessel, Cape Vincent, were modified by the addition of a new spar deck. This increased the overall militarily useful sq. ft capacity of each vessel. The two Cape V-class ships function the same in their ability to load wheeled and tracked vehicles via the stern ramp. MV Cape Victorys most notable feature is its total deck capacity consisting of 133,621 sq. ft of which 103,181 is militarily useful.

The Romanian language version Grand Bazar Rom√¢nia sau CƒÉlƒÉtor strƒÉin updated, translated by Vlad A. Arghir, was published simultaneously. The book gained significant and widespread attention from Romania's literary critics in print, broadcast and online media. Most praised its realistic tone, tragicomic style and accessible format. Some reviewers described the author as 'a British Ion Luca Caragiale', and one perceived a direct link to foreign travel writers of previous centuries in Romania, such as John Paget, James Henry Skene, Emily Gerard and Sacheverell Sitwell. Another likened Ormsby's style to that of a portrait artist, and, in terms of contemporary peers, he was compared to Irish writer Philip √ì Ceallaigh. However, one journalist suggested that the book represents an indictment of Romania by a foreign guest. General public response to the book was positive, at home and abroad. Three of Ormsby's stories were subsequently included in the 2011 anthology Bucharest Tales, published by New Europe Writers. Plot summary Based on the author's personal experiences in urban and rural Romania over a fourteen-year period between 1994 and 2008, the book consists of a series of vignettes delineating various aspects of modern Romanian life. A narrator tells the stories in the first person, using the present tense, and is closely linked to the events and characters portrayed, often with unexpected results. He describes encounters with taxi drivers, the new rich, teenagers, notaries, lawyers, waiters, musicians, friends, families, association presidents, politicians, etc. Settings range from Bucharest to Transylvania, from the mountains to the coast. In two stories, the narrator meets or observes Romanians abroad. The tone throughout is wry but empathetic, with elements of bittersweet comedy, danger and, on one occasion, violence, when interests and ideals clash. Most of the stories contain an allegorical twist, inviting wider interpretation.  Major Themes  The overriding theme is Romania's progress from former Communist dictatorship to a democracy within the European Union. The country's socio-cultural, economic and political transition provides the backdrop for a range of overlapping and often opposing sub-themes drawn from everyday life in town and country, home and abroad. These include new wealth; endemic poverty; bureaucracy; civil society; apartment block politics; hospitality; self-interest; compassion; authority; manners; petty corruption; service culture; the remnants of the 'communist' mindset; child-care; road safety; animal welfare; travel; hospitality; classical and popular music; work and leisure activities (notably jogging); ethnic minorities; gender issues; baptism and funeral rites.  Characters  Most characters are composites of several real people and appear in only one story. Some characters feature in several stories, such as 'Lumi', the narrator's helpful neighbour. A minority of characters are based on sole, real persons whose names/milieu were changed to protect privacy.  Literary significance and reception  Most Romanian literary critics, general readers and Romanophiles both in Romania and abroad, have responded positively to the book . However, some readers feel it is too close to the bone or gives a negative impression of the country. The author embarked on a reading tour of five Romanian cities (Cluj-Napoca, Timi»ôoara, Sibiu, Deva and Bucharest) in June 2008, and his writing received national media coverage. Raluca Ion, writing in Romania's daily broadsheet Cotidianul was one of the first critics to link Ormsby to one of Romania's most influential writers: The book was reviewed in some detail in the fortnightly national newspaper ‚ÄúFormula AS‚Äù, whose literary critic Adriana Bittel detected a clarity of purpose and lack of pretension: Robert Balan, in his review for the national daily G√Ændul, on 23 June 2008, suggested that Ormsby's approach revamps a literary tradition stretching back to the 19th and 20th centuries: David Shepard, a Romanian-in- exile reviewing the book for a Romanian tourism website in New South Wales, Australia, felt that Ormsby had encapsulated a modern cultural crossroads: \\"Never Mind the Balkans, Here‚Äôs Romania highlights the confluence of Romania‚Äôs deeply entrenched cultural traditions as they meet the new freedoms, temptations and commercialism that comes with being the newest nation in the European Union.\\" In 2009, literary critic Dan C. Mihailescu reviewed the book during his daily ProTV show Omul care aduce cartea (The man who brings the book). Mihailescu calls Ormsby \\"a very nice man who loves Romania but is baffled by our behavior.\\" Mentioning several of the stories and reading a passage describing the Romanian countryside, Mihailescu says the ending of the book is \\"divine\\", where Ormsby recalls a Caragiale character and hopes, like him, to find a job \\"chasing flies from Ci≈ümigiu Gardens.\\" Despite widespread praise in the media, not everybody was impressed. The national daily Romania Libera followed up its initial, positive May 2008 review in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ with a profile interview six months later, in which journalist Cristian Curus suggests to Ormsby that he had come to Romania to criticize it. The author explains that he had come as a BBC reporter, returned to teach journalism, settled in the country and written the book after Romanian friends urged him to record his anecdotes in print.

One of the pioneers of this field of electrochemistry was the German electrochemist Heinz Gerischer. The interest in this domain is high in the context of development of renewable energy conversion and storage technology. Historical approach Photoelectrochemistry has been intensively studied in the 70-80s because of the first peak oil crisis. Because fossil fuels are non-renewable, it is necessary to develop processes to obtain renewable resources and use clean energy. Artificial photosynthesis, photoelectrochemical water splitting and regenerative solar cells are of special interest in this context. Discovered by Alexander Edmund Becquerel. H. Gerischer, H. Tributsch, AJ. Nozik, AJ. Bard, A. Fujishima, K. Honda, PE. Laibinis, K. Rajeshwar, TJ Meyer, PV. Kamat, N.S. Lewis, R. Memming, JOM. Bockris are researchers which have contributed a lot to the field of photoelectrochemistry. Semiconductor electrochemistry =Introduction= Semiconductor materials have energy band gaps, and will generate a pair of electron and hole for each absorbed photon if the energy of the photon is higher than the band gap energy of the semiconductor. This property of semiconductor materials has been successfully used to convert solar energy into electrical energy by photovoltaic devices. In photocatalysis the electron-hole pair is immediately used to drive a redox reaction. However, the electron-hole pairs suffer from fast recombination. In photoelectrocatalysis, a differential potential is applied to diminish the number of recombinations between the electrons and the holes. This allows an increase in the yield of light's conversion into chemical energy. =Semiconductor-electrolyte interface= When a semiconductor comes into contact with a liquid (redox species), to maintain electrostatic equilibrium, there will be a charge transfer between the semiconductor and liquid phase if formal redox potential of redox species lies inside semiconductor band gap. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi level of semiconductor and the formal redox potential of redox species are aligned at the interface between semiconductor and redox species. This introduces an upward band bending in a n-type semiconductor for n-type semiconductor/liquid junction (Figure 1(a)) and an downward band bending in a p-type semiconductor for a p-type semiconductor/liquid junction (Figure 1(b)). This characteristic of semiconductor/liquid junctions is similar to a rectifying semiconductor/metal junction or Schottky junction. Ideally to get a good rectifying characteristics at the semiconductor/liquid interface, the formal redox potential must be close to the valence band of the semiconductor for a n-type semiconductor and close to the conduction band of the semiconductor for a p-type semiconductor. The semiconductor/liquid junction has one advantage over the rectifying semiconductor/metal junction in that the light is able to travel through to the semiconductor surface without much reflection; whereas most of the light is reflected back from the metal surface at a semiconductor/metal junction. Therefore, semiconductor/liquid junctions can also be used as photovoltaic devices similar to solid state p‚Äìn junction devices. Both n-type and p-type semiconductor/liquid junctions can be used as photovoltaic devices to convert solar energy into electrical energy and are called photoelectrochemical cells. In addition, a semiconductor/liquid junction could also be used to directly convert solar energy into chemical energy by virtue of photoelectrolysis at the semiconductor/liquid junction. File:n-type semiconductor and liquid junction.pngFigure 1(a) band diagram of n-type semiconductor/liquid junction File:p-type semiconductor and liquid junction.pngFigure 1(b) band diagram of p-type semiconductor/liquid junction =Experimental setup= Semiconductors are usually studied in a photoelectrochemical cell. Different configurations exist with a three electrode device. The phenomenon to study happens at the working electrode WE while the differential potential is applied between the WE and a reference electrode RE (saturated calomel, Ag/AgCl). The current is measured between the WE and the counter electrode CE (carbon vitreous, platinum gauze). The working electrode is the semiconductor material and the electrolyte is composed of a solvent, an electrolyte and a redox specie. A UV-vis lamp is usually used to illuminate the working electrode. The photoelectrochemical cell is usually made with a quartz window because it does not absorb the light. A monochromator can be used to control the wavelength sent to the WE. Main absorbers used in photoelectrochemistry =Semiconductor IV= C(diamond), Si, Ge, SiC, SiGe =Semiconductor III-V= BN, BP, BAs, AlN, AlP, AlAs, GaN, GaP, GaAs, InN, InP, InAs... =Semiconductor II-VI= CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 =Metal oxides= TiO2, Fe2O3, Cu2O =Organic dyes= Methylene blue... =Organometallic dyes= =Perovskites= Applications =Photoelectrochemical splitting of water= Photoelectrochemistry has been intensively studied in the field of hydrogen production from water and solar energy. The photoelectrochemical splitting of water was historically discovered by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 onto TiO2 electrodes. Recently many materials have shown promising properties to split efficiently water but TiO2 remains cheap, abundant, stable against photo-corrosion. The main problem of TiO2 is its bandgap which is 3 or 3.2 eV according to its crystallinity (anatase or rutile). These values are too high and only the wavelength in the UV region can be absorbed. To increase the performances of this material to split water with solar wavelength, it is necessary to sensitize the TiO2. Currently Quantum Dots sensitization is very promising but more research is needed to find new materials able to absorb the light efficiently. =Artificial photosynthesis= Photosynthesis is the natural process that converts CO2 using light to produce hydrocarbon compounds such as sugar. The depletion of fossil fuels encourages scientists to find alternatives to produce hydrocarbon compounds. Artificial photosynthesis is a promising method mimicking the natural photosynthesis to produce such compounds. The photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is much studied because of its worldwide impact. Many researchers aim to find new semiconductors to develop stable and efficient photo-anodes and photo-cathodes. =Regenerative cells or Dye-sensitized solar cell (Graetzel cell)= Dye-sensitized solar cells or DSSCs use TiO2 and dyes to absorb the light. This absorption induces the formation of electron-hole pairs which are used to oxidize and reduce the same redox couple, usually I‚àí/I3‚àí. Consequently, a differential potential is created which induces a current.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 as a part of the County Courthouses in Iowa Thematic Resource. The courthouse is the fourth building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History The legislature of the Wisconsin Territory chose Middle Wapello as the county seat to the exclusion of Upper and Lower Wapello. The county commissioners accepted the decision and the three communities later merged into a single town. The county's first courthouse was a privately owned structure built of logs. with A brick courthouse was built by the county in 1840. It was a structure was also used as a school house. The county lacked the money to pay for it so they agreed to pay the builder 20% interest on the $1,300 that was due them. A new courthouse was built in Wapello in 1854 for $9,577.69. Columbus Junction desired to be the county seat and they raised $25,000 and built a two-story brick building for a courthouse. When they failed to become the county seat the building became a school. The present courthouse was built on the same site as the 1854 building for around $100,000. Architecture The two-story building was designed in a simplified version of the Art Deco style by the Des Moines architectural firm of Keiffer, Jones and Thomas, and built by Zohbon and Lewis of Des Moines. It is constructed of tan colored bricks and trimmed in stone. The courthouses features a symmetrical facade with end pavilions that slightly project forward. Bas reliefs of eagles carved in stone in the center of the pavilions. The significance of the courthouse is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Wapello as the county seat.

Opened in 1940 as South Shore High School, South Shore is a part of the Chicago Public Schools district. History South Shore opened in 1940 as South Shore High School at 7626 South Constance Avenue.\\"South Shore at a glance\\". November 3, 1993. 95. During the early days, the school was predominately white; mostly populated by pupils in the South Shore community. By the late‚Äì1950s, the community began experiencing an increase in population by African-Americans. South Shore, which was built to accommodate at total of 2,000 students, became overcrowded by 1964. Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Board of Education decided a new school needed to be built to relieve the overcrowding. The plan to build a new extension of the school was implemented in 1965. Construction on the extension building at 75th street and Constance avenue began in April 1966. The extension school was to cost $2.5 million to build and was to be completed by 1967, but it was revised several times, gaining a budget of $4.1 million.

A Republican, he was the party's nominee for the 18th congressional district special election, held on March 13, 2018. The race proved to be very close, and was ultimately won by the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb with a margin of less than 0.4%. Saccone conceded the race eight days later. Saccone is critical of welfare spending. He supports using non- General fund money to balance the Pennsylvania state budget, but is not opposed to broad-based tax cuts in order to avoid raising taxes. Saccone's beliefs are strongly influenced by Christian reconstructionist and author David Barton, who also introduced Saccone's 2018 special election run. Education and career Saccone received a bachelor's degree in psychology/criminal justice from Weber State College in 1981, a master's degree in public administration from the University of Oklahoma in 1984, and a master's degree in national security affairs from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1987. Saccone received a Ph.D. in public and international affairs from the University of Pittsburgh in 2002. He was later on the faculty of Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He served as a United States Air Force officer, working in the Office of Special Investigation, counter intelligence. After resigning from the Air Force, Saccone was a civilian employee of the U.S. Army during the Iraq War, working in Iraq from 2004-05. While in Iraq, Saccone worked as an interrogation consultant at Abu Ghraib prison. According to his official and campaign biographies, Saccone worked as an anchor for an English-language television news station in South Korea, and worked for businesses in South Korea and Central America. He spent 12 years in South Korea, where he met his wife. Saccone's official biography states that he worked in North Korea on \\"an agreement meant to prevent the development of nuclear weapons there.\\" This was disputed by The Guardian, who stated that Saccone was misleading voters. Political career U.S. President Donald Trump =Pennsylvania House of Representatives= In 2010, Saccone challenged incumbent Democratic Rep. David Levdansky for the 39th District seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and defeated Levdansky by 151 votes (50.3% to 49.7%). Levdansky challenged Saccone to a rematch in 2012; Saccone defeated him again by a margin of 50.2%-49.8%. Saccone was re-elected with 60% of the vote in 2014 and 70% in 2016. The district includes part of Allegheny County and part of Washington County. =2018 U.S. Senate run= In February 2017, Saccone filed with the FEC to run for United States Senate in the 2018 election, seeking to challenge incumbent Bob Casey Jr., and officially declared his candidacy later that month. Saccone is a supporter of Donald Trump and pledged to be a Trump ally if elected to the Senate. On October 8, 2017, he suspended his U.S. Senate campaign to announce that he would seek the Republican nomination for the 18th Congressional District special election. =2018 18th congressional district special election= On November 11, 2017, Saccone became the Republican nominee for the 18th Congressional District special election held on March 13, 2018. The special election attracted national attention. Republicans spent more than $8 million on television advertising, twice as much as the Democrats, and Republican stars including Donald Trump (twice), Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Mike Pence came to the state to campaign for Saccone. As of March 14, Lamb led Saccone by 647 votes, mainly due to winning the Allegheny County portion of the district by 15,400 votes; Saccone won the rest of the district by 14,700 votes.Election results from CNN The result of the election was considered too close to call by most news outlets, since the candidates were separated by only 0.2 percent, and a recount was expected. However, when it became apparent that Saccone would not be able to overcome Lamb's slim lead, he called Lamb to concede the race on March 21. =Regular election for 14th congressional district= After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out the congressional map drawn by the state legislature and replaced it with a court-drawn map, most of the old 18th District was renumbered as the 14th District. On paper, the new 14th is even more Republican than its predecessor; Trump would have won it by 29 points had it existed in 2016. On March 15, Saccone announced that regardless of the final result in the special election for the 18th, he will run in the regular election for the new 14th. On May 15 Saccone lost the primary for the 14th district against Guy Reschenthaler (55%-45%). Political positions Saccone closely identifies with President Trump, calling himself \\"Trump before Trump was Trump.\\" Saccone's special election attracted national attention, and was seen by many political analysts and commentators as a bellwether on the popularity of the Republican party, Trump's taxes on foreign-made steel and aluminum imports, and the 2018 House election. Saccone has purposely stoked this portrayal, calling himself \\"Trump before Trump was Trump\\" and the special election a referendum on the Presidency of Donald Trump. =Abortion= Saccone is a pro-life advocate and, as a Pennsylvania State Representative, introduced legislation intended to reduce the number of legal abortions. =Church and state= In 2013, Saccone attracted attention for introducing the National Motto Display Act, a bill to require public school districts in Pennsylvania to post \\"In God We Trust\\" (the national motto) in every school building. The 2013 legislation failed, but in 2016, Saccone co-sponsored similar legislation (which would encourage but not mandate the posting of the motto in schools). The bill passed on a 179-20 vote in May 2016. The legislation was criticized by secular advocacy groups, such as the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Also in 2013, Saccone sponsored a \\"day of prayer\\" resolution, seeking to designate April 30 as a National Fast Day. In January 2012, Saccone introduced to the state House a nonbinding resolution (Resolution No. 535) to declare 2012 as the \\"Year of the Bible\\" in Pennsylvania. The resolution passed unanimously, but was criticized by Americans United for Separation of Church and State.Joseph L. Conn, Year of the Bible?: Pa. House Urges 'Faith In God Through Holy Scripture', Wall of Separation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, January 27, 2012. The resolution drew considerable political controversy in Pennsylvania, as well as national attention.Matt Miller, Neither side is budging in Pennsylvania House's Year of the Bible resolution, pennlive.com, April 9, 2012. The Freedom from Religion Foundation filed a federal lawsuit over the resolution, Freedom From Religion Foundation v. Saccone, alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause. U.S. District Judge Christopher C. Conner dismissed the suit on the grounds of legislative immunity, but criticized the legislature for using state resources to \\"provide a re-election sound bite for use by members of the General Assembly.\\"Saranac Hale Spencer, Pennsylvania legislators' 'Year of the Bible' declaration legal but ill-advised, judge says, post-gazette.com, October 22, 2012. =Religious views= In an interview in 2017 with the Pastors Network of America, Saccone stated that God wants those who have the \\"fear of God in them\\" to \\"rule over us\\". =Donald Trump= During his brief 2018 Senate run, Saccone pledged to be a Trump ally if elected to the Senate. In January 2018, Saccone was endorsed by Trump after winning the Republican nomination for the 18th congressional district special election. =Economy= Saccone supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018, saying \\"I'm sorry I wasn‚Äôt there to vote for it\\". Over the course of the campaign for the 2018 special election seat, Saccone distanced himself from ads which touted his support for the tax cuts and the ads, which while prominent at the start of the campaign, were cycled out. =Government spending= In February 2018, it was falsely reported that Saccone used his legislative expense account, which is funded by taxpayers, at a greater rate than other lawmakers. =Guns= Saccone is known for his strong advocacy of gun rights. In 2017, he sponsored at least four bills seeking to expand the rights of gun owners; one such bill would amend state law to prohibit discrimination against gun carriers; a co-sponsorship memorandum for the bill criticized Chuck E. Cheese's for its \\"policy barring customers from carrying firearms inside\\" the venue. =Organized labor= Saccone favors right-to-work legislation, which makes it illegal for workers in unionized workplaces to be compelled into joining unions. According to NBC News, \\"Saccone‚Äôs conservative record has united organized labor against him.\\" Saccone disputes the characterization, saying \\"the union members have always voted for me. Their leadership has never represented their members, and they know that.\\" =Lobbyism= Saccone introduced legislation that would prohibit public officials from accepting \\"transportation, lodging or hospitality or anything of economic value as a gift\\" from lobbyists. Saccone said, \\"I have at least 20 lobbyist groups that have never taken me out for anything. They come to my office, they make their pitch and they go away. And that is how it should be.\\" However, it was later reported that Saccone did routinely get meals paid by lobbyists; Saccone justified getting gifted meals by lobbyists, saying that he had to have the meals with the lobbyists because other lawmakers did and he did not want to isolate himself from other lawmakers. =Torture= Saccone advocated for waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and other forms of torture in articles and his book.Unseen War in Iraq: Insurgents in the Shadows, eastbaytimes.com, October 15, 2008. Allegations of wasting government money According to The Intercept, records recovered from the Pennsylvania General Assembly showed that Saccone often spent extensively on non-essential items. They stated that Saccone often used taxpayer money \\"for meals, per diem payments, and other items at a rate higher than most lawmakers.\\" The investigation showed that Saccone purchased 36 line items for various flag and flag accessory purchases totaling $4,436.30.

It was built in the 14th century and demolished by the order of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in the 18th century together with most of the city walls, because the inner walls were limiting the town's growth. It was named after Saint Lawrence. Unlike the Michael's Gate, the only medieval city gate still standing in Bratislava, Laurinc Gate did not contain a tall tower. Instead, it was a massive square- shaped structure with a long tunnel at the ground floor. There was a water moat in front of it and unlike the sometimes dry moat near Michael's Gate, this one always contained water due to its proximity to the Danube and the presence of the mouth of a stream coming down from the Little Carpathians mountains. Today, a portcullis hanging over Laurinsk√° Street symbolizes the place of the former Laurinc Gate.  History  Laurinc Gate was constructed together with the oldest parts of the city walls in the second half of the 13th century. Through most of its history, Bratislava was known as Pressburg or Pozsony. The gate was continually strengthened and improved over the centuries. Its name comes from a small church that stood directly in front of it (later demolished in the first half of the 16th century. The church, together with its chapel was consecrated to Saint Lawrence ().

After years of declining enrollment, the school closed after the 2017‚Äì2018 school year and was later demolished in September 2018. History Prior to becoming Robeson High School, the school was known as Francis W. Parker High School from 1910‚Äì1977. Parker was located at 68th and Stewart Avenue (6800 S. Stewart Avenue) about 100 yards away from the present Robeson location in the Englewood area of Chicago. At the time, the school was located on the same campus with Wilson Junior college and Chicago Teachers College. The new school building was constructed on the former Normal Avenue Park siteCPSR - Paul Robeson's Chicago History 1921-1958, named for Robeson, opened on September 6, 1977. During the 2003‚Äì2004 and 2004‚Äì2005 school years, Robeson served as a receiving school for students affected by the closings of Engelwood High School (which was located about 2.5 miles away) and Calumet High School, which lead to Robeson being overcrowded. By the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, CPS considered the campus for consolidation due to its low‚Äìenrollment.Chicago Teacher's Union, Englewood HS Due to low enrollment and poor academic performance, Chicago Public Schools decided to close Robeson along with three other neighborhood high schools: Harper, Hope College Prep and Team Englewood.

It was previously the 55th Artillery, U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. (CAC) Lineage Constituted 1917 and organized CD Boston 12-1-17 as 55th Arty, CAC, by redesignation of 152nd Co, CAC;, 96th Co, CAC; 11th Co, MANG, CAC; 83rd Co, CAC; 4th Co, MANG; 9th Co, RING; 3rd Co MANG; and 5th Co, MANG. In addition, many individual transfers were made from the 1st, 2nd, 6th, & 9th Cos, MANG, and 13th Co, RING. The 55th Arty departed New York for Europe 3-25-18. After additional training, the 55th Arty was assigned to the 31st Bde, CAC, in August 1918 and served in France until the Armistice. The 55th Arty departed Brest, arriving New York 1-22-19 and moved to Camp Mills, NY, until 1-26-19, when it moved to CD Long Island Sound. 1st Bn was stationed at Fort H.G. Wright, 2nd & 3rd Bns at Fort Terry. There most of the regiment's NG and National Army personnel were discharged. On 1-29-19 the 55th Arty CAC was transferred with 31st Bde to Fort Winfield Scott, arriving 2-23-19 with 9 officers and 170 EM. The 31st Bde was then transferred to Fort Lewis, WA, arriving 10-4-19, and its strength was gradually built up to near peacetime levels. In April 1921, the 55th Arty was assigned to Hawaii. The 31st Bde was broken up and personnel from the 57th Arty were reassigned to the 55th Arty and to the 59th Arty slated for the Philippines. This enabled the 55th to activate HHD&CTs; of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Bns, as well as to moderately reinforce the firing batteries. In addition, Service Btry was activated. The 55th Arty arrived in Honolulu 5-12-21 and was posted to Fort Kamehameha. The regiment was soon reorganized. The three battalions were restructured with three batteries each by reassigning personnel from three companies manning fixed seacoast armament. This resulted in the activation of Btrys G, H, & I and the relocation of 1st Bn to Fort Shafter and 2nd Bn to Fort Ruger. On 6-1-22, each component of the 55th Arty received an additional serially numbered company designation. These additional designations were dropped on 7-1-24, when the regiment was redesignated 55th CA (TD) (Tractor Drawn) Regt. Personnel shortages resulted in a 10-31-25 reorganization; the 3rd Bn was inactivated at Ft. Shafter, its personnel reassigned to 1st Bn, replacing personnel transferred to the 64th CA (AA) Regt. The reorganized 1st Bn, 55th CA, moved to Ft. Kamehameha and Service Btry combined with HHB. At this time Btry C, 55th CA, transferred to the 64th CA (AA) Regt as Btry I. A new Btry C was constituted and activated in the 55th CA. In the mid-1930s, 2nd Bn HHB moved to Fort DeRussy although its firing batteries remained at Fort Ruger. On 2-17-41, AA detachments were organized in Btrys E & F to man fixed 3-inch AA guns at Ft. Ruger and Sand Is. On 12-7-41, the 55th CA was posted around Oahu: Btrys A, B, & C on Oahu's southwest coast between Pearl Harbor and Kaena Point, Btrys D & E on the northeast coast, and Btry F on Sand Is. On 12-27-41, Btry D moved from Ft. Ruger to the Island of Kauai, where it established Camp Kauai. When filler personnel arrived from the mainland at the end of June 1942, two officers and 69 enlisted men from Battery C, 55th CA, with a pair of 155 mm GPF mobile seacoast guns was deployed to Canton Island in January 1942 where they later also manned four 4-inch navy guns. Battery D was reinforced to its authorized wartime strength. Detachments from Btry A formed Btry 80-X in December 1941; a second detachment helped form the 804th CA (HD) Btry (Sep). Btry F at Sand Is. was designated the 807th CA (HD) Btry (Sep), while a second detachment helped organize the 715th CA (HD) Btry (Sep) 10-21-42. During World War II, various changes were made in the makeup of the 55th CA. The 55th CA (155 mm Gun) Regt was reorganized and HHB reconstituted and activated; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Bn HHBs were activated at Ft. Ruger 5-22-43. Btry G (SL) was activated at Ft. Kamehameha. The 1st Bn HHB and Btrys A, B, & C, and 2nd Bn HHB were stationed at Ft. Kamehameha, Btry D on Kauai, Btry E at Wilridge. A detachment from Btry F was at Sand Is. The 811th CA (HD) Btry (Sep) was activated 8-1-42, at Hilo, HI, with personnel from Btry B. In September 1943 Btry E manned Btry Willy's 155 mm guns on Wiliwilinui Ridge near Btry Wilridge, an 8-inch naval turret battery. Btry F was posted at Camp Punchbowl, a 155 mm position overlooking Honolulu. Both batteries were released from Hawaiian Seacoast Artillery Command 9-30-43 and moved to Ewa, Oahu, staging for deployment to the Gilbert Islands in the Central Pacific as components of army defense battalions providing garrison forces. Btry E went to Tarawa and Btry F to Apamama in 5-31-44 when the 55th CA Regt was inactivated. HHB 3rd Bn at Ft. Ruger was inactivated 5-31-44 and its personnel reassigned to HHB 179th CA (155 mm Gun) Bn, which shortly thereafter moved to Kahuku, in HD Kaneohe Bay and North Shore. Personnel of Btry E reassigned to Btry A and personnel of Btry F reassigned to Btry B, 179th CA Bn. Both Btrys A & B, 179th CA Bn, returned to Oahu soon thereafter. The 55th CA was disbanded 6-14-44.

Joseph P. Horner Memorial Library Its Joseph P. Horner Memorial Library is the largest private German-language library outside of Germany. The Library was founded in 1817 and throughout its history collected a wide variety of literature and periodicals to serve the reading interests of German Society members; it continues to operate as a lending library today, with a focus on fiction, biography, and children's books in German. In 1867, under the leadership of Oswald Seidensticker, an archive was established, with the aim of documenting German-American history and culture, and that remains the primary mission of the Library today. Among the holdings are many early products of the German- American press, including a 1743 Christoph Sauer Bible, the first European- language Bible printed in North America. As a research institution, the Horner Library is also known for its pamphlet and manuscript collections related to German-American organizations and individuals, and its holdings of 19th- century popular German works that have become rare.Harry W.

After launch, it was delivered to CMB Italy after which it was briefly renamed Taabo Italia. She was acquired on 13 May 1993 by the US Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration and renamed Cape Vincent, 1 February 1994, assigned to the Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force. Cape Vincent is operated by Keystone Shipping Company. When activated, Cape Vincent is one of the Maritime Administration's 31 Roll- on/Roll-off Reserve Force Ships assigned to the US Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) Sealift Program Office. Cape Vincent is nested at the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Beaumont, TX. in ROS-5 status, with a 10-man maintenance crew on board. History After reflagging, Cape Vincent entered the RRF in Reduced Operating Status ‚Äì 4 (ROS-4) on 19 August 1994. The vessel is required to be ready for tender to COMSC within 96 hours of an activation notice. The ten-person ROS crew performs continuous maintenance in order to maintain the vessel in class with the American Bureau of Shipping and fully certificated by the USCG. As an ROS-4 vessel, Cape Vincent conducts an annual maintenance activation. This at-sea operational period enhances the material condition of her plant. Cape Vincent is currently in ROS-5 status. =Cargo capability= From June through November 1998, Cape Vincent and her sister vessel Cape Victory were modified by the addition of a new spar deck. This increased the overall militarily useful sq. ft capacity of each vessel. The two CAPE V class ships function the same in their ability to load wheeled and tracked vehicles via the stern ramp. Cape Vincents most notable feature is its total deck capacity consisting of , of which 126,084 is militarily useful. Cape Vincent has 126,084 sq ft of heavy deck strength (over 525 psf with 13 f. clearances) and 30,440 sq ft of light deck. In addition, Cape Victory has 100 450-volt reefer outlets. =Operations= Within one month of entering the RRF, on 9 September 1994, the Cape Vincent loaded cargo at Wilmington, North Carolina, and departed for Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Cape Vincent supported Operation Uphold Democracy, a peace-keeping mission, for 104 days before returning to Beaumont, Texas. Following her return from Uphold Democracy she returned to her layberth and was next activated on 25 December 1994, for Fuertas Defensas 95, providing 45 days of transport for outsized unit equipment to Guatemala in support of military training. This was part of a larger exercise which included the Army's Battlefield Visualization initiative in Panama. On 4 September 1996, Cape Vincent underwent a test of her activation readiness capability and successfully activated in 1.9 days. Cape Vincent surpassed this record, activating in 1.8 days for a humanitarian relief effort to Central America in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. Cape Vincent transported construction equipment and relief supplies for 108 days. On 30 March 1999, Cape Vincent received the Maritime Administrator's Professional Ship Award in recognition of her service. The Cape Vincent was activated on 17 January 2003 for Operation Iraqi Freedom and loaded cargo from the 4th Infantry Division at the Port of Beaumont. The ship spent a total of 118 days in Full Operating Service (FOS), discharging cargo in Kuwait, loading in Turkey, discharging in Rotterdam and returning to Beaumont on 16 May 2003. Cape Vincent was active moving military equipment to Kuwait and back until the latter part of 2008. In 2005, Cape Vincent was on charter to FEMA providing relief to victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Cape Vincent is located in the Beaumont Reserve Fleet in Reduced Operating Status with a crew of 10. operated by Keystone Shipping until Jan 2016. Patriot Contract Services took over operations in February 2016. Cape Vincent moved to the Marad Reserve Fleet in Beaumont, Texas, in August 2009 along with her sister ship Cape Victory, saving the US Government approximately $1 million per year.

Launched in August 2010, the website is designed to give the residents of San Francisco Web 2.0 tools through which to engage in city issues. Its main purpose is to encourage civic discussion which it does through a number of forums focusing on themes such as education, jobs and tax reform. In addition it includes online polls and petitions on particular issues. It is an example of an increasing trend towards user generated government to give people more avenues through which to participate in politics.  Campaigns  Although the website states itself primarily as a venue for the sharing of ideas, it has taken a position and led campaigns on certain issues. = Parking Tickets = In January 2011 Phil Ting used the website to criticize what he argued was the writing of excessive parking tickets in order to boost city tax revenue. 2,700 people signed the Reset San Francisco petition calling for a change in ticketing policy. Users of the website responded by calling for San Francisco to adopt a system similar to the \\"One-Click Hearings\\" recently established in New York City. This system allows New Yorkers to contest unfair parking tickets by submitting evidence online. The system claims to streamline the appeals process making the system fairer and more efficient. = Twitter Tax break = Following the news that San Francisco has plans to give a large tax break to the local company, Twitter, the website held a discussion to try to establish a consensus on the issue. A website poll showed 45% in favor, 44% opposed with the remaining 11% unsure. With no strong consensus the site ran dueling petitions on the issue. = YouTube Testimony = In March 2010 Phil Ting and Reset San Francisco established an online campaign, petitioning City Hall to accept YouTube videos on the same basis as conventional public testimonial. The campaign aims to make it more convenient for the public to engage in city politics by using online tools. The current system requires citizens to attend city meetings which are generally held during regular working hours, preventing many working people from being able to participate in the political process. Ting's campaign argues that being busy should not prevent people from being involved, and that YouTube technology is a way to overcome this.  Food For Thought  Reset San Francisco ran a community event in Golden Gate park on February 26 named Food for Thought. Over 250 citizens of San Francisco attended the event to discuss possible solutions to the city's problems. The participants split into various groups each leading discussion on a different theme such as transportation, housing and the environment. This was the first of several events intended to harness the discussion of the online community to help facilitate real world political engagement.

Thornton (1873‚Äì1907) was an English Christian missionary to Cairo, Egypt with the Church Missionary Society from 1898 to 1907.  Family  Douglas Thornton grew up in the county of Suffolk, England in a family that was well established in the Christian faith. Both his father, Rev. Claude Cecil Thornton, and his grandfather, Rev. Spencer Thornton, were both dedicated clergymen and his mother also came from a deeply religious family. The devotion to faith seen in his parents and grandparents influenced him greatly toward a love for the Bible and for missionary work. In 1899, one year after his arrival in Cairo, Thornton married Elaine Anderson and two years later in 1901 they had their only child ‚Äì a son named Cecil.  Education  After spending four years preparing at Marlborough College he left for Cambridge University in 1892. Beyond his formal learning in mathematics he threw himself heavily into Christian life and ministry in his university years. He immediately involved himself in the Cambridge Missionary Union as well as the Christian Union at the school which steadily evolved and joined with the more international Student Volunteer Movement largely due to Thornton‚Äôs influence. Perhaps his greatest literary accomplishment was his creation of the magazine ‚ÄúOrient and Occident‚Äù which began in 1904. The magazine reached out to the educated members of society, but not only students. The regular magazine had illustrated articles addressing both religious and non-religious issues for both young and old readers in two languages.  Last Days  Douglas Thornton died of typhoid fever in 1907, his eighth year in Egypt. His final year was plagued with sickness and disappointment before a resurgence of energy, health and new excitement to begin a new ministry in Upper Egypt. Just before initiating this new ministry he fell ill once more and never recovered.  Additional Literary Contributions  Beyond his vast literary contributions in Egypt in general, Thornton can be specifically remembered by a number of works. After gaining proficiency in the Arabic language, in 1902, Thornton meticulously edited and oversaw the printing of a new edition of the Arabic Prayer-Book in Cairo. His greatest and farthest reaching literary success came in publishing ‚ÄúOrient and Occident‚Äù beginning 1904. Before departing for Egypt and during his time on staff at the Student Volunteer Movement he also wrote a text book, or \\"missionary study\\" for Christian College Unions entitled Africa Waiting or the Problem of Africa's Evangelization.

Location The headquarters of the group and two of its manufacturing companies and factories are located on at Lubowa, Wakiso District, on the Kampala-Entebbe road, approximately south of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. New premises were acquired at the Kampala Industrial and Business Park at Namanve, also in Wakiso District, to house new steel mills belonging to Roofings' subsidiary company, Roofings Rolling Mills Limited (RRM), the third company in the conglomerate. It is expected that once the new facilities are brought on- line, employment at Roofings Limited and RRM will triple from the present 1,000 to about 3,000. The new factories will be built and operated in collaboration with two Japanese steel companies, Yodogawa Steel Works and Fujiden International. The Japanese firms will, in turn, take an equity position in RRM. More recently, the group has opened a polyvinyl chloride pipes and building materials factory at Lubowa, the Roofings Polypipes.

In August, Radio Dabanga reported that the rebels were gaining ground against government forces. The conflict has led to the displacement of nearly 400,000 residents of the Nuba Mountains and surrounding areas. = Blue Nile = Disputes over the rightful government of Blue Nile State led to a resumption of violence in late August/early September 2011. In September and October the SPLA-N formed a government based in Kurmuk, which took control of large parts of the state. The conflict in the Blue Nile has raised fears of a new refugee crisis and a return to civil war. In September 2012, Amnesty International reported that SPLM-N teacher and activist Jalila Khamis Koko was summoned by a prosecutor for six charges, primarily relating to state security. The organization stated that she appeared to be \\"held solely for her humanitarian work and for the peaceful expression of her views\\", and designated her a prisoner of conscience. She was released after a court hearing on 20 January 2013. 2017 split In mid-2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al- Hilu and one led by Malik Agar. Fighting between the two factions in the Blue Nile included the killing of an SPLM-N (Agar) army major by the SPLM-N (al- Hilu). SPLM-N (Agar) secretary-general Ismail Khamis Jallab claimed that SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had refused mediation efforts. A key factor motivating the split was that al-Hilu's group insisted on including the establishment of a secular state in negotiations with the al-Bashir government of the time, while Agar's group disagreed. In the 2019‚Äì2020 Sudanese Revolution phase of the Sudanese peace process, the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) continued to insist on secularisation of the state as a requirement for a peace deal. Sudanese peace process The August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace agreement for resolving the War in Darfur and the Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile be made within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. As part of the resulting Sudanese peace process, on 18 October, after a three- hour negotiating session mediated by a South Sudanese mediation team, Amar Daldoum, on behalf of the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and Shams al-Din Khabbashi, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council signed an agreement on political, security and humanitarian procedures. The agreement was cosigned by the chair of the mediation team, Tut Galwak. The SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and the Sovereignty Council planned to develop a Declaration of Principles to organise continuation of the peace process and to present their political vision. On 24 January political and security agreements, constituting a framework agreement, were signed by the Sovereignty Council and Ahmed El Omda Badi on behalf of SPLM-N (Agar). The agreements give legislative autonomy to South Kordofan and Blue Nile; propose solutions for the sharing of land and other resources; and aim to unify all militias and government soldiers into a single unified Sudanese military body. On 18 August 2020, the SPLM-N and the Sudanese government signed an agreement to integrate the rebels into the army within 39 months. The SPLM-N (Agar) and SPLM-N (al-Hilu) factions signed a comprehensive peace agreement with the Transitional Government of Sudan on 31 August 2020 and 3 September 2020 respectively, and both factions will now participate in the transition to democracy in Sudan through peaceful means. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to three seats on the sovereignty council, a total of five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled between 30 and 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states or regions.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sudan- darfur/sudan-signs-peace-deal-with-key-rebel-groups-some-hold-out- idUKKBN25R14Thttps://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/historic- agreement-signed-by-sudan-govt-armed-groups-in-juba Aims and ideology The party describes itself as \\"a Sudanese national movement that seeks to change the policies of the centre in Khartoum and to build a new centre for the benefit of all Sudanese people regardless of their religion, gender or ethnicity background\\".http://sudancatholicradio.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=4471:splm- north-prepares-alternative-to-ncp&catid;=2:south-sudan&Itemid;=84 Since the resumption of conflict, the party has called for negotiations and a ceasefire, however some leaders of the SPLA-N have warned of a potential second partition of the Sudan.

It was located on Wilhelmstrasse 102 in the present-day Kreuzberg district, in the vicinity of Potsdamer Platz. History The building was erected in 1737‚Äì39 in the course of the city development of the boggy grounds in southern Friedrichstadt at the behest of King Frederick William I of Prussia, it was to serve as a residence for the French Baron Fran√ßois Mathieu Vernezobre de Laurieux (1690‚Äì1748). The well-off baron and his family had left Paris after the collapse of John Law's Mississippi Company in 1720 and befriended with the king. The three-storey building had a courtyard open to the street, two economic wings on the left and right of the entrance, as well as extended gardens in the rear, stretching up to the Berlin Customs Wall in the west. When the King ordered Vernezobre to marry his daughter to Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix, who she rejected, the marriage was only averted when he agreed to undertake the construction of a prestigious city residence for the King in the Husarenstra√üe, later renamed Wilhelmstrasse in honor of the King, who died in 1740. Vernezobre's heirs had to sell the premises in 1760, and in 1772 they were acquired by the royal House of Hohenzollern as a summer residence of King Frederick William's daughter Princess Anna Amalia, the youngest sister of Frederick the Great. Upon her death in 1787 it served in 1796 as a quarantine station for the then spectacular smallpox vaccination of the Prussian Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm. Occupied by Napoleon's troops after the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt and temporarily used as a depository, the building decayed and fell into disrepair afterwards. Finally, in 1830 it was acquired by Prince Albert of Prussia, youngest son of King Frederick William III of Prussia, upon his marriage with Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. He had the Palais remodeled as his residence by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, surrounded by a park laid out according to plans designed by Peter Joseph Lenn√©, including a riding stable and an ice rink open to the public. However, the prince's marriage turned out to be an unhappy one, the couple divorced in 1849 and Albert entered into a morganatic marriage with Rosalie von Rauch, wherefore he had to leave the Prussian court. He moved to the Saxon capital Dresden, where he had Schloss Albrechtsberg erected by architect Adolf Lohse, who from 1860 to 1862 also refurbished the Berlin palace. Meanwhile, the formerly remote area had become a major hub with the opening of the nearby Potsdamer Bahnhof and Anhalter Bahnhof railway stations in 1838 and 1841. After Prince Albert's death in 1872, the building was inherited by his son Prince Albrecht. The property was managed by the valet August Sabac el Cher, an Afro-German descending from Sudanese Kurdufan, who had been \\"presented\\" to his father by WƒÅli Muhammad Ali of Egypt at Cairo in 1843. The building remained in private hands of the Hohenzollern dynasty even after the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. A salon in the Palais, 1928 In 1926 the large Europahaus was built in the backsided gardens. From 1928 to 1931, the Palais was rented by the German government and used as a state guesthouse, hosting such guests as King AmƒÅnullƒÅh KhƒÅn of Afghanistan in 1928 and King Fuad I of Egypt in 1929. The last chapter in the Palais' history began after the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933. In May, the headquarters of the newly established Gestapo secret police moved into a neighbouring building around the corner on Prinz-Albrecht- Strasse. When in 1934 the Sicherheitsdienst intelligence agency of the Reichsf√ºhrer SS Heinrich Himmler took control over the Gestapo, Sicherheitsdienst chief Reinhard Heydrich moved from Munich to the Berlin Prinz-Albrecht-Palais. In 1935 also the neighbouring buildings at 101 Wilhelmstrasse and 103/104 Wilhelmstrasse were taken over and integrated into the large complex, which in 1939 became the main administrative seat of the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA). The Palais and the adjacent buildings were destroyed during the Battle of Berlin in a RAF air attack on 23 November 1944. Seized by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany after the war, the realty was incorporated into the American sector of Allied-occupied Berlin. The ruins were cleared in 1955, but the site was left vacant. In 1961 Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, head of the House of Hohenzollern, officially renounced all claims to the realty. Today the area is used for the Topography of Terror exhibition, which focuses on the human rights abuses of the Nazi police state.

The abbey is the oldest nunnery of the Cistercian Order in Germany to have maintained unbroken occupation of its house since its foundation. St. Marienthal is located to the south of Ostritz on the left bank of the Neisse, which at this point forms the German border with Poland. To the north, G√∂rlitz is about 20 kilometres away. History Church and abbey The abbey was founded in 1234 by Kunigunde of Hohenstaufen, daughter of Philip of Swabia and wife of Wenceslas I of Bohemia, near a trade route that ran from Prague to G√∂rlitz via Zittau. As early as 1235 the new foundation was incorporated into the Cistercian Order, with the abbot of Altzella acting as visitor. The first documented abbess of St. Marienthal Abbey was the noblewoman Adelheid I. von Dohna (Donyn), daughter of Burgrave Otto von Dohna (Donyn). The abbey was destroyed during the Hussite Wars in 1427, and not rebuilt until 1452. It was damaged by fire in 1515, 1542 and (particularly seriously) in 1683. Rebuilding in the Baroque style began in 1685. The Baroque church interior suffered extensive damage in a flood of the Neisse in 1897. During World War II the buildings were used as a military hospital. In 1945 the retreating German forces wanted to blow up the abbey to hinder the advance of the Russians, but the nuns refused to leave, and the building was spared. The abbey survived the Communist East German r√©gime and after 1989 spent large sums on restoration and developing the facilities. In August 2010 however another flood of the Neisse caused catastrophic damage.

The roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex built as part of Bahrain's 2030 modernization plan. Pearl Monument The Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle, having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9‚Äì11 of that year.Timeline of the GCC Summit, gulfnews.com, Dec. 10, 2010 =Symbols and representation= The Pearl Monument consisted of six dhow \\"sails\\" projecting up to the sky, which came together to hold a pearl at the top. The six sails designated the Gulf Cooperation Council's six member nations, while the pearl symbolized their united heritage and the country's famous history of pearl cultivation.Bahrain: Two Million Tourists Can't Be Wrong April 17, 2007, Bahrain Embassy At the base of the monument was a dodecagonal pool with fountain jets. The Pearl Monument is featured on the face of the Bahraini half-dinar coin, the highest value coin in Bahraini currency. The Central Bank of Bahrain reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half- dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed. The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the Central Bank of Bahrain. =Demolition= On the morning of March 18, 2011, the government tore down the Pearl Monument, the rallying point for anti-government protests. On the morning of March 18, 2011, the government tore down the Pearl Monument, announcing on state broadcaster BTV that the monument had been \\"violated\\" and \\"desecrated\\" by the \\"vile\\" anti- government protests, and had to be \\"cleansed.\\" In the government's haste, a migrant crane worker was crushed to death by a falling cement arch. The moment of demolition was censored on state television in order to hide the man's death.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaTKDMYOBOU Bahraini uprising (2011‚Äì2014) Army checkpoints still surround the area where Pearl Roundabout was located The Pearl Roundabout was the site of demonstrations during 2011, which began in February. It has been compared by the protesters to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the main site of demonstrations during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. On 15 February 2011, after the funeral procession of Mr Ali Mushaima, more people joined the demonstrators and moved towards the Pearl Roundabout, where they arrived at around 15:00. By 15:15, demonstrators began to set up tents at the roundabout, and later in the day a projector screen was installed. Among these was a tent erected by members of the SMC medical staff. There were also a number of demonstrators obstructing traffic in the roundabout overpass. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand. The roundabout and its immediate vicinity were congested with protesters and private vehicles. Police in the area neither engaged the demonstrators nor did they attempt to disperse them. King Hamad had ordered that members of the procession be allowed to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness.http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf (p81) On 17 February 2011, while demonstrators were spending the night at the Pearl Roundabout, police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians (See Bloody Thursday (2011)). Soon after the police crackdown on demonstrators, Bahraini police official Al-Hassan appeared on national television to explain the previous night's events. Al-Hassan argued that demonstrators were warned beforehand and that they refused to leave the area. He also added that demonstrators were actually in possession of weapons such as knives and pistols. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by King Hamad of Bahrain to prepare a report on the events on February and March saw no evidence to suggest that protesters at the roundabout were armed. Soon after the police crackdown, Bahrain Defense Force tanks occupied Pearl Roundabout to stop demonstrators from occupying the area. Some demonstrators who stayed close to Salmaniya Hospital where injured demonstrators were being assisted tried to retake Pearl Roundabout and headed towards the area. Demonstrators were shot by forces camping in Pearl Roundabout. Following these events, the Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman Al Khalifa came on Bahrain state television and demanded calm of all parties. The following day, he ordered the military tanks to leave the Pearl Monument and protesters were allowed to occupy the area peacefully and were guaranteed by the Crown Prince that they would be able to demonstrate without any further attacks. On March 16, however, the protesters' camp in the roundabout was evacuated, bulldozed, and set on fire by the Bahraini Defense Force, riot police, and Peninsula Shield Force, two days before the Pearl Monument was demolished. An expatriate crane operator was crushed to death during the demolition by a piece of the monument which fell onto his crane cabin. Al Farooq Junction Al Farooq Junction under construction in late March After demolishing the Pearl Monument, the government announced that the roundabout would be replaced with traffic lights, possibly to ease congestion in the financial district. The government changed the name of the site to Al Farooq Junction, a reference to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a historical figure revered by Muslims. The name of Al Farooq was given to the junction as well as the military operation by Khalifa Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the head of security forces and a member of the royal family.http://www.b4bh.com/vb/t209111.html On 25 February 2015, the public was restricted from accessing Al Farooq Junction. The area was sealed off by security forces since protesters were cleared from the Pearl Roundabout on 16 March 2011. On 14 June 2017, the junction was opened for public.

Agriculture used to be the common profession which is thinning out lately. Public services is a new avenue its people are pursuing. Boki Wavdi is one of the main attractions here. It is believed that this bavdi was dug by Preto ghosts. Whoever drinks this water once becomes a hero, and opens his blood.

Sankaran's football team comes first at the district level every time. Gair-dance is famous here, which is done by all people at night. History Sankarna is identified with Sakarne, where the army of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji, led by his generals Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan, halted after its raid on Gujarat in 1299. The Mongol soldiers of Alauddin's army mutined over payment of khums during the halt. At that time, Sankarna was a part of the Jalore kingdom. According to the 17th century chronicler Munhot Nainsi, the rebels were aided by the local ruler Kanhadadeva, but the veracity of this claim is doubtful, as Nainsi incorrectly mentions that Alauddin was personally present at the location of the mutiny. In 1311, the Jalore kingdom was captured by Alauddin Khalji. It subsequently became part of several kingdoms and empires. Before the independence of India in 1947, it came under the jurisdiction of Jodhpur State.

British officials have visited Libya several times since then, including two visits by Prime Minister David Cameron on which large crowds turned out to welcome him. The British Armed Forces are also helping to train Libya's National Army as part of wider cooperation on security matters. Security conditions have deteriorated since 2014, when the United Kingdom suspended operations from their embassy in Tripoli, into a second civil war.  History  = Colonial years and Kingdom of Libya (1943-1969) = Libya was an Italian colony for much of the early 20th century until it was invaded in World War II, with Tripolitania and Cyrenaica being occupied by the UK and Fezzan occupied by France. After the war, the United Nations organised negotiations to decolonise Libya. These were successful and on 24 December 1951, the United Kingdom of Libya was established under the leadership of King Idris. Under Idris, Libya maintained a close relationship with the UK even after their relations with other Arab nations soured due to the 1956 Suez Crisis. = Libya under Gaddafi (1969-2011) = Relations after Muammar Gaddafi's 1969 coup were extremely poor, with Gaddafi's government taking a combative anti-Western stance and developing weapons of mass destruction. Poor relations were reinforced by direct confrontations such as the murder of Yvonne Fletcher, the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103. Despite these setbacks, relations began to improve during the 1990s, and peaked in December 2003 when Libya announced that they would abandon their weapons of mass destruction programmes. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair then travelled to Tripoli, met with Gaddafi and declared a \\"new relationship\\" between the countries. Afterwards, Libyan police officers were trained in Britain in English and security procedures, e.g. Criminal Justice Procedures and Stop & Search Procedures and Techniques.Libyan Police Officers in Security and English Training at ISE Hove, Website of ISE, 22 February 2008, Retrieved 23 September 2014  Civil war  UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague speaking to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen at the London Conference on Libya on 29 March 2011 Although relations had improved under the leaderships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, they once again soured in 2011 with the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War. UK Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the \\"appalling and unacceptable\\" violence used against protesters, and anti-Gaddafi protests broke out at the Libyan embassy in London. The UK froze the Gaddafi regime's assets in the country and joined France in leading the push for military intervention against Libyan government forces. A group called \\"Topple the Tyrants\\" occupied Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's London mansion and called on the Gaddafi family to leave Libya. After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011 the United Nations Security Council approved military intervention in Libya, and two days later the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at regime targets before sending in fighter jets to protect civilians. The Libyan government condemned the intervention as colonialism by its \\"crusader enemy\\" and claimed the UK's bombs were targeting civilians. The UK expelled Gaddafi's ambassador in May and cut its last ties with Gaddafi's Libya on 27 July, by revoking its diplomatic recognition of the Gaddafi regime and transferring it to the National Transitional Council. The Libyan charg√© d'affaires and all remaining embassy staff were expelled from the country and its embassy was shut down. The Gaddafi regime remained defiant even as it was bombed by UK forces; when the 2011 England riots broke out in August 2011, the regime's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim urged Cameron to step down saying that \\"David Cameron has lost all legitimacy and must go\\", mockingly echoing the comments made by Cameron about Gaddafi. The statement also called for international military intervention in the UK, and Libyan state TV reported false claims that the British government was using Irish and Scottish mercenaries against rioters.  LSE Gaddafi links scandal  In the wake of the civil war, a scandal erupted at the London School of Economics and Political Science over its ties to the Gaddafi regime. As a result of the revelations the LSE's Director, Sir Howard Davies resigned on 3 March 2011 citing \\"errors of judgement\\". = Post-Gaddafi Libya (2011-present) = David Cameron at the International Conference in Support of the New Libya in September 2011, where the Friends of Libya group was created The UK formally recognised the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) as the government of Libya in July 2011, expelling the Gaddafi regime's remaining diplomats and inviting the NTC to nominate an ambassador and take over the Libyan embassy in London, which they did on 10 August. David Cameron visiting Benghazi in September 2011 Following Gaddafi's ouster, UK Prime Minister David Cameron visited Libya with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and was greeted in Benghazi by a crowd of thousands who cheered as he addressed them, saying \\"It is great to be in free Libya.\\" Cameron pledged support for the new government in rebuilding Libyan infrastructure, and Gaddafi regime assets worth billions of dollars were unfrozen and handed over to the NTC. Gaddafi's ouster prompted British police to reopen their investigations into the murder of Yvonne Fletcher and the Lockerbie bombing. The NTC promised to cooperate with the investigation and in December 2012 Libya's ambassador to the UK announced that all files relating to Lockerbie would be released, although likely not until Libya's new constitution has been completed and a permanent government is in place. This was followed in January 2013 by the news that Scottish police officers would be visiting Libya to conduct their investigation. In January 2013, the UK government issued a travel warning urging British citizens to leave the Libyan city of Benghazi due to an unspecified \\"specific and imminent threat to westerners\\". Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said the move was an \\"exaggeration\\" but that he could understand the motivations behind it. David Cameron again visited Libya on 31 January, meeting with Zeidan as well as President of Congress Mohammed Magariaf. He promised further cooperation in training Libya's security forces and said that \\"the British people want to stand with you.\\" The United Kingdom suspended operations from their embassy in Tripoli on 2 August 2014 due to a rise in post-civil war violence in the city. Diplomatic relations with Libya were retained, as embassy staff continued to work from within neighbouring Tunisia. Embassy staff tweeted that fighting had spread to areas near the embassy and it was unsafe to operate there, but they hoped to return as soon as possible. However the situation developed into an ongoing second Libyan Civil War. Second civil war In July 2015 the Foreign Affairs Select Committee started an investigation into the UK government‚Äôs intervention in Libya, and subsequent collapse of the Libyan government. The chairman of the committee, Crispin Blunt said \\"It has turned out to be a catastrophe for the people of Libya.

It is an alternative to historical cost and fair value or mark to market accounting. Some writers prefer terms such as 'value to the owner' or 'value to the firm'. Deprival value is also sometimes advocated for liabilities, in which case another term such as 'Relief value' may be used. The deprival value of an asset is the extent to which the entity is \\"better off\\" because it holds the asset. This may be thought of as the answer to the following questions, all of which are equivalent: - What amount would just compensate the entity for the loss of the asset? - What loss would the entity sustain if deprived of the asset? - How much would the entity rationally pay to acquire the asset (if it did not already hold it)?  Deprival value explained  Deprival value is based on the premise that the value of an asset is equivalent to the loss that the owner of an asset would sustain if deprived of that asset. It builds on the insight that often the owner of an asset can use an asset to derive greater value than that which would be obtained from an immediate sale. For example, a machine may be profitably employed in a business but no more than scrap value could be obtained from its sale (net selling price). Deprival value reasons that the maximum value at which an asset should be stated is its replacement cost as, by definition, the owner can make good the loss arising from deprival by incurring a cost equivalent to replacement cost. However, if that amount is greater than the amount that can be derived from ownership of the asset, it should be valued at no more than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is, in turn, defined as the higher of net selling price and value in use, which is the present value of the future returns that will be made by continuing to use the asset. In summary: * Deprival value equals the lower of replacement cost and recoverable amount; and * Recoverable amount is the higher of net selling price and value in use. An important practical implication of deprival value reasoning is that many assets will be stated at replacement cost, as entities tend to hold and use assets that they can employ profitably and dispose of those that they cannot.  Criticisms of deprival value  Critics of deprival value assert that it is more complex than other measurement bases. Its use may also give rise to values that differ significantly from market values. Comparison between the values of assets owned by different entities may be difficult where deprival value is used because it reflects the position of the reporting entity. Critics also point out that the calculation of value in use is difficult and may be subjective.  History and current developments  The origin of deprival value is frequently ascribed to JC Bonbright's 1937 work The Valuation of Property.WT Baxter \\"Accounting Values and Inflation\\" 1975, page 126 Edwards and Bell's The Theory and Measurement of Business Income (1961) Edgar O Edwards and Philip W. Bell \\"The theory and measurement of business income\\" 1961. For a modern appreciation see Geoffrey Whittington's ‚ÄòWhat the Old Guys can Tell Us: Edward and Bell's The theory and measurement of business income‚Äô (The Irish Accounting Review, Summer 2008) was hugely influential in emphasising the difference between entry and exit values and making the case for replacement cost. Articles by Solomons, David Solomons, David \\"Economic and Accounting Concepts of Cost and Value\\" in ‚ÄòModern Accounting Theory‚Äô, edited by Morton Backer (Prentice-Hall, New Jersey 1966) and Parker and Harcourt influenced a generation of accounting scholars.Introduction to Parker and Harcourt Readings in the Concept & Measurement of Income (Cambridge University Press, 1969). Also in the second edition edited by Parker, Harcourt and Whittington (Phillip Allan 1986). In his 1975 work, WT Baxter seems to have been the first to use the term 'deprvial value'.WT Baxter \\"Accounting Values and Inflation\\" 1975 During the 1970s deprival value played a major role in the development of accounting in times of inflation, being endorsed by official reports in the UK,Inflation Accounting: Report of the Inflation Accounting Committee Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1975. (The Sandilands Report) Australia,Report: Inflation and Taxation Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation, Australian Government Publishing Service, 1975. (The Matthews Report) New Zealand The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Inflation Accounting, New Zealand Government Printer, Wellington, 1976.

Bowen High School (known simply as Bowen High School) is a public 4‚Äìyear high school located in the South Chicago neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Bowen is operated by the Chicago Public Schools district. From 1993 until 2011, Bowen was divided into four smaller schools. Today, the smaller schools have been re-consolidated back into one school. History The 1910 building by Dwight Perkins Bowen High School was established in 1882 under the name South Chicago High School in one of the classrooms of the Bowen Elementary School (demolished), which was located at the northwest corner of 93rd Street and Houston Avenue in the then-independent community of South Chicago. Fourteen pupils were given high school-level instruction. The elementary school and its successor high school were named for Colonel James A. Bowen (1822-1881), the first president of the Calumet and Chicago Canal Dock Company and the man known as \\"the father of South Chicago\\". The two schools became separate institutions in 1910 when the current building was constructed at the northeast corner of Marquette and 89th Street.CELEBRATING BOWEN HIGH SCHOOL'S 100th ANNIVERSARY It was designed by Dwight Perkins (1867‚Äì1941), supervising architect of the Chicago Public School system between 1905 and 1910, and built \\"on identical plans\\" as its more famous cousin, Irving Park High School. (opened as Carl Schurz High School The latter building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building cost $700,000 and contained about 125 rooms; it was noted for its manual training and domestic science departments. By the 1930s, Bowen's student body had grown to 4,600, due to the great increase in immigrants of Polish and Slavic descent in the South Chicago area.Bowen High School Athletics Bowen competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). Bowen sport teams are called the Boilermakers. The boys' baseball team were Public League champions in the 1953‚Äì54 and the 1971 season. The boys' soccer team were Public League champions three times (1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81 and 1981‚Äì82).IHSA Chicago (Bowen) the boys' football team were Blue Division champs in 1963 defeating Harlan 19-18. After taking a 13-0 lead at half time Bowen came back in the last two minutes of the game to win it on a pass from George Lalich to Steve Zinini. Steve served as a gunner on a chopper in Vietnam. The team got the ball back because of a fumble recovery by Jim Robinson who served as a marine in Vietnam. Those three were the heroes of the game. They were Blue Division Champs back to back in 1982 and 1983 defeating Harlan each time. The following year they moved up to The Red Division.

The event has been held in various locations across the west coast including Seattle, San Bernardino, and Mountain View spanning either one or two days. As the festival continued to grow from its earlier roots, it branched into two festivals: Beyond Socal and Beyond Norcal / Bay Area to cater to the growing audience. However, this expansion of the Beyond series lasted for only four years before founder Pasquale Rotella announced that he would no longer continue having both Beyond Socal and Norcal to pursue expanding and creating other festivals of the Insomniac brand.  History  The history of Beyond Wonderland extends back before its inaugural 2010 date. The first festival was held at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino, California. Insomniac Events announced the conception of Beyond Wonderland to be considered as the sister festival of Nocturnal Wonderland (formerly known as Nocturnal Festival). Fans of Insomniac Events called for a return to the past vibrant environment that the Nocturnal Festival once hailed. Insomniac believed Beyond Wonderland could provide this environment. With the success of Nocturnal Festival, Insomniac introduced the Wonderland series with Beyond Wonderland as its first expansion from the Nocturnal Festival, promising to \\"return to the amazing hues and vibrance of our original Wonderland event.\\" The festival features multiple stages of electronic dance music artists with such genres as: House, Trance, Dubstep, Drum and Bass, and ambient. The festival has also been known for features such as a light maze, many modern art sculptures, and poi dancers. As the festival continues to grow, new interactive additions are added each year to help enhance the experience, such as various dancing characters and aesthetic decorations. As Insomniac Events continued to grow, new art installations, characters, and themes that focused more into the Alice in Wonderland motif became the aesthetic for Beyond Wonderland. When Insomniac expanded Beyond Wonderland to include camping in 2015, Beyond seemed to be a second wind for festival-goers who had experienced the Nocturnal Series in the Fall prior. However, when Beyond was moved from the San Manuel Amphitheater back to the NOS Center, it no longer offered camping.

Known as \\"The Swing Surgeon,\\" Trahan is the father of PGA Tour professional golfer D. J. Trahan.  Early life  Trahan was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father introduced him to the game of golf when he was ten years old. By the age of twelve, Trahan was a scratch golfer and a member of New Bedford Public Links, now called Whaling City Golf Club (known as The Whale). Trahan graduated from Bishop Stang Catholic High School in 1967. He was the top player on the high school golf team all four years he attended. Trahan then brought his talents to Southeastern Massachusetts University (Now University of Massachusetts, North Dartmouth) where he was again the top player on the golf team all four years he attended. He is a member of Delta Kappa Phi fraternity. He graduated in 1971 with a double major in political science and history with plans to become a corporate attorney. Trahan met his wife, Susan, while attending college. The two married in 1973 and moved to Port Orange, Florida where Trahan would begin his effort to obtain his PGA Tour Card. From there, Trahan took an assistant's job at Sugar Mill Country Club in New Smyrna Beach, Florida and entered into the PGA of America Apprentice Program. He earned a Class A membership in 1977. He would later achieve the rare status of PGA Master Professional in 1992.  Philosophy  Don Trahan is one of the most respected teachers in the game of golf in the United States of America and around the world. Golf industry experts, Tour players and fellow professionals consider him one of the most knowledgeable students of the golf swing. They gave him his nickname, \\"The Swing Surgeon,\\" because it is said that Trahan can take apart a golf swing and put it back together without leaving any scars. While Director of Golf Instruction for Sea Pines Resort at the famed Harbour Town Golf Links, Don created one of the most organized and successful teaching centers in the United States, including a teaching certification program for all of the resort's golf instructors. His list of regular students includes a growing number of members of the PGA, LPGA, and other mini Tours. He also works with college and junior players. Don's exceptional reputation as a teacher comes from both his unique training methods and swing methodology, acquired through years of study with engineers, physicists, a kinesiologist and an orthopedic surgeon to learn the physics and physiology of swinging a golf club. From this study evolved \\"The low stress, low maintenance golf swing,\\" through which Don shows students how to hit the ball straight and long without stress and strain. Prior to his work at the Sea Pines/Harbour Town Golf Links, Don ran golf schools in Florida and was head golf professional at Pinetree Country Club in Kennesaw, Georgia. He has been a golf professional for over 35 years. His Swing Surgeon Golf Schools are located at Old South Golf Links in Bluffton, South Carolina (near Hilton Head Island, SC). Don's passion for helping golfers play better and enjoy the game more resulted in the creation of several distinctive training aids and instructional videos. These instruction and training tools have become the nucleus of his company, The Swing Surgeon Group. In addition, Don shares his knowledge and philosophy through various websites.  Author  Don was a teaching editor for Golf Magazine from 1987‚Äì1992 and continues to have articles published there and in numerous national magazines. The February 1998 issue of Senior Golfer Magazine featured a six-page article outlining the results of a study based on Don's theory of the short, 3/4 length, limited turn backswing. The biomechanical study in which Don participated, and scientifically proved correct, showed that a short swing does not lose clubhead speed versus a full parallel swing. Don was featured in the July 1993 issue of Choice Magazine, the award-winning publication of Golf-Digest Japan. Most recently Don wrote the feature instruction article for the February 1998 issue of Senior Golfer Magazine.

The village, at an elevation of , is situated near the left bank of the Huancabamba River which is renamed the Pozuzo River after it passes by the village. The population of the village in 2017 was 1,366. Pozuzo was established in 1859 by Austrian and German immigrants to Peru and traces of German culture and architecture survived into the 21st century. Pozuzo was isolated and difficult to access until 1976 when a vehicle road was completed linking the village with the town of Oxapampa, north. History Franciscan missionaries established a mission at Pozuzo in 1712, but the colony and mission was abandoned or destroyed in the 1740s or 1750s in the Atahualpa Rebellion by the Ash√°ninka (or Campa) people of the area. The colony was reestablished and a bridge was constructed across the Pozuzo river about 1790. The indigenous people of the area were ravaged by smallpox epidemics. When explorer William Smyth reached Pozuzo in 1828 the Franciscans had abandoned Pozuzo and the only inhabitants were one Ash√°ninka family although other indigenous farmers lived nearby and a number of areas were cultivated with coca, sugar cane, squash, and cassava (yuca). Smyth described the mule trail leading eastward from the Andes highlands to Pozuzo as narrow and dangerous. In the 1850s, Peruvian President Ram√≥n Castilla proposed to build a railroad from the capital city of Lima, across the Andes Mountains, and onward to the navigable rivers of the Amazon Basin. Part of the plan (the only part realized) was to import German and Austrian Catholics to settle on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in the tropical rainforests of the Amazon region, then populated only by indigenous people. Downloaded from JSTOR. In 1855, the Peruvian leader signed an agreement with German traveler Kuno Damian von Sch√ºtz-Holzhausen to recruit 10,000 Germans and Austrians to emigrate to Peru and establish colonies on the eastern flanks of the Andes. The Peruvian government agreed to pay the cost of the passage from Europe to Peru of the emigrants and the cost of transporting them overland to Pozuzo and other areas designated for their settlement. On arrival in Pozuzo, each family would receive of farmland. Single men would receive . Part One, Two, and Three. Sch√ºtz traveled to Germany in 1856 to recruit settlers and assembled a group of 302 persons, about 200 from the Tyrol and 100 from Moselle and Prussia. Among the colonists were two Roman Catholic priests, one of whom was Jos√© Egg, a leader among the colonists. Most of the colonists were poor peasants and artisans with large families. They group departed Antwerp on the sailing ship Norton on 26 March 1857 and arrived in the port of Callao, Peru on 8 August 1857. On arrival Sch√ºtz found that the Peruvian government had done little to prepare for the arrival of the colonists and their transportation to Pozuzo. The colonists undertook a difficult journey on foot and mule to reach Pozuzo, starting from the port of Huacho, reaching an elevation of more than crossing the Andes, to Cerro de Pasco, onward to Acobamba (Ambo), and, constructing the road enroute, to Pozuzo. The town was established in 1859 by 172 of the original 302 colonists who had departed Europe together. Many had deserted en route or had died or been killed during the journey. One of the early decisions of the colonists was to separate the land allocated to the Prussians and the Tyroleans. The Prussians settled south of Pozuzo and established the village of Prusia; the Tyroleans established the village of Pozuzo. \\"Distrito Pozuzo,\\" Peru Tourist Guide, , accessed 20 June 2020}} Pozuzo was one of the few German colonies in the Amazon basin of Peru in the 19th century which survived and prospered. By 1889, Pozuzo had a population of 565 persons, nearly all of them farmers. Among a variety of crops grown the most important commercial crops were tobacco, coffee, coca, and rice. In 1891, colonists from Pozuzo founded the town of Oxapampa, which quickly eclipsed Pozuzo in population, and in 1928 found the town of Villa Rica, a coffee growing area. Over the years the Germanic heritage of the people of Pozuzo has become diluted by intermarriage and in-migration from the Andes and the local indigenous people. In 2005, only about 15 percent of the population of about 4,000 in Pozuzo district claimed to have German heritage. In the same year, the first non-Germanic mayor of the town was elected, a man with an Andean heritage. Climate Pozuzo has an Af (tropical with adequate precipitation throughout the year) climate under the K√∂ppen Classification system. Measured by the Trewartha climate classification system the climate is Arbb (tropical, adequate precipitation throughout the year with warm summers and warm winters) Pozuzo's climate is modified by its altitude which results in temperatures several degrees lower year round than the nearby low-elevation tropics. The difference in average temperatures between the warmest and coolest months is only 1.5 degrees C (3 degrees F). The austral winter months of June, July, and August are the driest of the year.

It was most famously used by id Software's John Carmack in games such as Commander Keen to compensate for the poor graphics performance of PCs in the early 1990s. Its principal innovation is a novel use of several EGA hardware features to perform the scrolling in hardware. The technique is named for its other aspect, the tracking of moved graphical elements in order to minimize the amount of redrawing required in every frame. Together, the combination saves the processing time that would be otherwise required for redrawing the entire screen. Carmack designed the software engine based on a scrolling display for large images from the 1970s. Because CGA (the previous generation of PC graphics hardware) lacks features for scrolling in hardware, scrolling previously had to be done in software, by redrawing the entire screen for every frame ‚Äì a task that PCs of the time lack the performance to carry out. Adaptive tile refresh minimizes the computing power required for sidescrolling games to within the reach of available hardware. This works by flagging bitmap tiles and redrawing only the graphics on the screen that actually update. History Adaptive tile refresh using hardware scrolling made its first appearance in an unreleased test game dubbed Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, implemented by Carmack. The title of \\"Dangerous Dave\\" had been previously used by John Romero while programming games for Softdisk. The new game is a recreation of the first level of Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. 3, intended as a realistic test bed for the adaptive tile refresh concept, and was developed within a week. The team of future id Software employees, still working for Softdisk, then recreated the entire Mario game, hoping that Nintendo would license the game for the PC. Nintendo declined the offer to release the game after id Software finished it. The first market appearance of Carmack's adaptive tile refresh came in id Software's first installment of the Commander Keen game series, Marooned on Mars. Technical details EGA has several features that enable the adaptive tile refresh effect: # The screen buffer can be slightly wider than the screen and arbitrarily high, subject to video memory limitations. # The position within this buffer from which the screen is drawn can be offset by 1 pixel increments, either horizontally or vertically. # It has enough video memory to store two such screen buffers, and still have room left over for tiles and sprites. Carmack used these capabilities to create a buffer that is 64 pixels wider and taller than the screen, leaving room for two extra rows and columns of tiles in the buffer off the edge of the screen. He used the offset capabilities of the card to let the screen slide through the buffer for smooth scrolling, which partially reveals the extra tiles. Scrolling is limited to the buffer size, and scrolling further wraps around to show data from the other side of the buffer. So in order to scroll through an entire level, when the scrolling amounts to a whole tile's worth, Carmack's code then draws the next row of tiles from the level into the buffer, just off the edge of the screen, ready to be displayed when the scrolling continues in that direction. But since only the edges of the screen are being redrawn at any time, sprites in the level do not get redrawn until they reach the edge of the screen. To counteract this, the code calculates which tiles a moving sprite had previously covered and redraws them to erase the old sprite image, then draws the new sprite image in its new position. This allows sprites to be animated independently of the scrolling with minimal computational effort. Since moving a sprite in this way involves first erasing it and then redrawing it, the image of the erased sprite may be visible briefly, causing flicker. The final part of Carmack's technique is the use of the same EGA hardware features used for scrolling to also implement double buffering: setting up a second buffer into which the code can draw while the first buffer is being shown on screen, which is then switched out during screen refresh. This ensures that no frame is ever displayed mid-drawing, which yields smooth, flicker-free animation.

The system was the third cyclone and the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2002‚Äì03 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Ami developed from a low-pressure area east of Tuvalu on January 12. Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the southwest early in its existence. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed and began moving towards the south and then southeast. The cyclone attained severe tropical cyclone intensity on January 13. Ami made its first landfall at Vanua Levu, before subsequently making another landfall on Taveuni. Still intensifying, Ami reached peak intensity as an equivalent Category 3 cyclone on the Australian and Fiji cyclone scales on January 14. Accelerating to the southeast, the cyclone began to cross over cool sea surface temperatures and encountered wind shear. Ami transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the day after. Cyclone Ami severely impacted areas of Fiji, primarily causing flooding. Numerous landslides and power outages resulted from the heavy rains. Damage was particularly severe in Labasa, Fiji, where floodwater inundated the entire city. Damage sustained to crops was also severe, especially the sugar cane, where production decreased by 15% due to Ami. In Tonga, damage was not as severe. However, two ships offshore were grounded due to the cyclone. Ami caused F$104.4 million (US$51.2 million)All damage totals in United States Dollars are obtained by converting from FJD using rates as of January 15, 2003. in damages and 17 deaths, primarily on Fiji. Following the deaths and damage, the name \\"Ami\\" was later retired. Meteorological history On January 9, 2003, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi (RSMC Nadi) started to monitor a weak tropical depression, that had developed within a monsoon trough about to the northwest of Apia, Samoa. Over the next two days as the system moved towards the southwest further development of the depression was inhibited by strong vertical windshear, before during January 11, the vertical windshear decreased and the system started to rapidly develop further. As it developed further the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system, before they designated it as Tropical Cyclone 10P later that day as the 1-minute sustained windspeeds became equivalent to a tropical storm. RSMC Nadi subsequently reported six hours later that the depression had developed into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, and named it as Ami, while it was located just to the east of the southern Tuvalu island of Niulakita. Tracking southwest, the storm was named Tropical Cyclone Ami at approximately 0000 UTC on January 12 under favorable upper-level diffluence facilitated by the nearby ridge of high pressure. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed in forward movement and turned on a more southerly course. With minimal wind shear and a good outflow pattern, Ami achieved severe tropical cyclone intensity at 0600 UTC on January 13. A poorly defined eye feature became visible on satellite imagery, at which point the storm was situated around 160 mi (260 km) north-northeast of Labasa. The cyclone made landfall on Vanua Levu with a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar (28.4 inHg) before subsequently crossing the western tip of Taveuni. Broadly turning toward the southeast, Ami traversed the Lau Islands. While located about 60 miles south of Lakeba ‚Äì at 0600 UTC on January 14 ‚Äì the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (140 km/h) and a pressure of 950 mbar (28.0 inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm with 1-minute winds of 125 mph (201 km/h). Accelerating toward the southeast with forward speed reaching 40 mph (64 km/h), Ami began to gradually weaken due to resuming wind shear and increasingly cool waters. The cyclone interacted with a frontal boundary, and in doing so it transitioned to an extratropical cyclone. Ami lost all tropical characteristics by 1200 UTC on January 15, although its remnants continued eastward to a point well south of Rarotonga. On January 14, RSMC Nadi issued their final advisory on Ami and passed the primary warning responsibility for Cyclone Ami to the Wellington Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC Wellington) as the system moved below 25 ¬∞S. Preparations and impact =Fiji= alt=Satellite image of a strengthing tropical cyclone. It developed a ragged central dense overcast, with some area of thunderstorms and clouds. Prior to the storm, 30 evacuation shelters were opened. On Lavau Island, residents took shelter in limestone caves to avoid the oncoming storm surge. After the storm, major damage was recorded to houses, crops, schools across Fiji. Heavy rainfall led to landslides and intensive flooding, and combined with storm surges to give rise to dangerous flash floods. The maximum rainfall total was , recorded at the coastal site of Vatuwiri on Taveuni Island. Due to the rugged terrain of the island, the rains resulted in heavy flooding. Power lines were cut off in Vanua Levu, Taveuni, and the Lau Islands, resulting in widespread power outage. In Vanua Levu, damage to crops and bush material were reported. The island was also damaged by strong tidal swells and storm surge. Communications with the island were cut off at approximately 1700 UTC, preventing damage reports from being communicated for a period of time. Labasa, Fiji was inundated under of water. The city's morgue could not operate due to damage sustained by Ami. As a result, bodies found in the area had to be cremated. An entire family was reported to have drowned after their house was inundated by rising floodwater. Two children went missing an others were injured when a wooden church on Druadrua Island being used as a shelter collapsed. However, the two children were later found alive in the debris. St. Bede's College in Savusavu was severely damaged by Ami. Across much of the islands, agricultural damage was widespread. Primarily due to damages sustained on the Fiji Sugar Corporation sugar mill in Labasa, sugar cane production in 2003 dropped by 800,000 tonnes (882,000 short tons), equivalent to 15% less than forecast. Coconut plantations also sustained heavy damages. In Lau Province and Lomaiviti Province, an estimated 158 houses were completely destroyed. In the two provinces, damages totaled to F$4.5 million (US$2.2 million). However, in Macuata, Cakaudrove, and Bua provinces, 2,287 houses were destroyed. In those three provinces, damages were estimated to be F$23.7 million (US$11.6 million). After Fiji cut water supplies, residents feared that the water would be contaminated with disease and other chemicals. As a result of Ami, F$104.4 million (US$51.2 million) in damages resulted from the cyclone, and 14 people died. =Tonga= In Tonga, no significant damage was reported, although minor power outages occurred on some islands. Nuku'alofa reported maximum wind speeds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Damage to fruit trees accounted for most of the damage on Tonga. Offshore, however, two ships were grounded, including the Olovaha ferry offshore of Popua Beach, but no fatalities were reported. Aftermath A P-3 Orion was sent from New Zealand to investigate the damage caused by Cyclone Ami, departing from Whenuapai. 150 soldiers from the Republic of Fiji Military Forces were on standby in Suva in preparation for sending equipment to affected areas. Fijian patrol boats carrying emergency supplies were also headed for affected regions to provide medical and shelter equipment. The Fiji Red Cross Society (FRCS) provided assistance and emergency supplies to at least 2,000 families affected by the storm. The FRCS focused on provided victims items such as clothing, cooking utensils, and towels. In addition, the World Bank proposed disaster mitigation and adaptation to help reduce flood impact in Fiji. After the cyclone, Vanua Levu was declared a state of emergency (by the Fijian government) and a disaster area. The Cabinet of Fiji later met in Suva, Fiji in order to change the national budget to allocate relief and reconstruction funds.

As pianist S√°ndor L√°szl√≤, in Freiburg, about 1920, he recorded 31 reproducing piano rolls for Welte Mignon, of the piano music of mostly 19th Century Classical composers.Smith & Howe: The Welte Mignon: Its Music & Musicians, (1994), p.408.

According to the studies of the psychologist Georg Ansch√ºtz, the mentor of the synaesthesia research of this time, L√°szl√≤ developed an apparatus for the combination of colored light, slides, moving amorphous and geometrical forms. The first demonstration of it took place under the name \\"Sonchromatoskop\\" in 1924. Although this sonicism was developed by music, it should neither serve the intensification of the musical life, nor should individual keys be illustrated by clearly related colors. Rather, it was a new art genre in which abstract images and sound do not behave supplementarily, but enter into an original and inviolable unity. L√°szl√≤ built a professional Sonchromatoskop and it was controlled by the pianist. In 1925 Laszlo wrote a text called Color- Light-Music, and toured Europe with a color organ. Smith & Howe refer to him constructing a 'Fablichtklavier' (Color pianofort√©) and publishing a book , 'Fablichtmusic', in 1925 which describes the genre. He also participated in many Jewish lead charities. In 1938 he came to the United States, starting in Chicago as music professor at the IIT Institute of Design. In the 1940s he was music director at NBC Radio. In Hollywood from about 1944, he wrote the music for several films such as Charlie Chan and the Chinese Cat (1944), Scared Stiff (1945) and Yankee Kafir (1947).https://rmoa.unm.edu/docviewer.php?docId=wyu-ah03246.xml Also, The Great Flamarion (1945), The Amazing Mr. X (1949), Tarzan's Magic Fountain (1948), Night of the Blood Beast (1958), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959) and The Atomic Submarine (1959), and television series including Rocky Jones, Space Ranger and My Little Margie.

In 1972 director William Crain did the first blaxploitation horror film, Blacula. History Blaxploitation films, regardless of subgenre, spawned from race movies. These were films that started appearing in the 1930s-1940s. They were meant to segregate films featuring an all black cast from mainstream Hollywood movies. Many of these films already had the element of horror integrated into them. Over time these films transcended into their own subgenre of film, blaxploitation horror films. In the 1950s to 1960s Hollywood started to integrate films produced and starring African Americans into mainstream media. There was backlash by several African American directors and actors that did not want to be integrated into mainstream media. They wanted to stay independent which caused them to create more of what were originally known as race movies.Harris, Mark H. \\" African-American Horror Movies 101, Black Is Boo-Tiful\\", about.com, 15 Feb. 2011 This happened during the 1960s-70s which was during the time of the Civil Rights Movement. African Americans were in fury at ongoing white oppression and wanted something that they could call their own.Lawrence, Novotny. \\"Deadlier than Dracula.\\" Blaxploitation Films of the 1970s Blackness and Genre. New York [u.a.: Routledge, 2008. 53-59. Print. They began creating films that were directed, starring, and produced by African Americans. In an effort to maintain their cultural identity they made it a point to emphasize the stereotypes the white media was portraying them as. They called this genre blaxploitation. Many blaxploitation films have a mix of comedy and horror. However, director William Crain took the aspect of horror in these films one step further and created the first blaxploitation horror film, Blacula. As a result, a new subgenre of blaxploitation was created, dedicated solely to horror.\\"1970's BLAXPLOITATION / HORROR HISTORY in 1970's Forum.\\" THE HORROR DRUNX - Horror Movie Message Boards Forums. Web. 15 Feb. 2011 Background Blaxploitation is a portmanteau of the words \\"black\\" and \\"exploitation\\". It makes a point to enforce stereotypes that have been afflicted on African Americans by the so- called white media. The first blaxploitation film was Sweet Sweetback‚Äôs Baadasssss Song (1971). Melvin Van Peebles directed, produced, and took the hyper-sexualized lead role. He played a male prostitute who is out to fight \\"[the man]\\" (white oppression). It spanned a new type of film genre that evolved all the way to what is now the urban blaxploitation horror films of the 21st century.Reid, Mark A. \\"Two African American Horrors.\\" Black Lenses, Black Voices: African American Film Now. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. 61-76. Print. Blacula Blacula, filmed in 1972, was the first ever blaxploitation horror film. The film was directed by William Crain and starred William Marshall, Vonetta McGee, and Denise Nicholas. The film was a parody of the popular film Dracula. In the film Blacula, played by William Marshall, an African prince named Mamuwalde is bitten by Count Dracula (Charles Macaulay) himself and is turned into a vampire. An interracial gay couple of interior decorators buy the coffin that Blacula has been in for the last 200 years and bring him back to their home in Los Angeles. Blacula has not been fed in over 200 years in Count Dracula's effort to punish him. Once he freed from his coffin, Blacula goes loose on the streets of Los Angeles and becomes the black avenger. He terrorizes the city in his effort to quench his thirst for blood. While on his search to kill he meets a woman named Tina (Vonetta McGee) that looks just like his departed wife. He believes that she is the reincarnation of his wife and is bent on winning her affection by any means necessary. Tina‚Äôs friend Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala) finds out that Blacula is a vampire and tries to kill him.\\"Blacula (1972) - IMDb.\\" The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Web. 15 Feb. 2011. . While Blacula can be viewed as a merely a cheesy parody of the film Dracula with an all black cast, it should also be noted for its portrayal of human sexuality and politics. Before becoming a vampire, Blacula was an African prince that wanted to connect Africa with the West. He tries to form this connection in an effort to stop the slave trade. Since the first part of the film is set right before the 18th century it can be taken to mean that the slave trade they are referring to in the film was the North Atlantic slave trade. This gives insight into the way Africans viewed the slave trade. Blacula goes to Count Dracula to ask him to stop the slave trade. Unfortunately Count Dracula likes the slave trade and wants to keep it in existence. This can be viewed as to how Africans saw whites as oppressors that wanted to reap the benefits of the slave trade. Not only was Blacula brought to America by two interior decorators, but they were a gay interracial couple. This was very ground breaking at the time when racial prejudice and homophobia was running ramped of the films release.Lawrence, Novotny. \\"Deadlier than Dracula.\\" Blaxploitation Films of the 1970s Blackness and Genre. New York [u.a.: Routledge, 2008. 53-59. Print. Despite the controversies, the film Blacula went on to be named one of Variety‚Äôs Top 50 Movies of 1972 and to win Best Horror Film of 1972 by the Academy of Horror Films and Science Fiction Films. Crain went on to film the sequel Scream, Blacula, Scream; although it was not as successful, it is still considered a notable horror film (see below).Paszylk, Bartlomiej. \\"Scream, Blacula, Scream (1973) and Horror Express (1973).\\" He Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: an Historical Survey.

Stereotypical charactersSpook - The spook is usually the comedic sidekick that is afraid of everything. *Primitive - This character is from the rural parts of Africa. He partakes in African rituals and is bent on killing everyone. *Mystical darkle - Like the old Magical Negro stereotype, the mystical darkle has some sort of magic powers that he or she uses to help or save the main character. *Voodoo doer - This character is a hybrid between the primitive and the mystical darkle. *Heroic death wisher - This character is usual a minor character that heroically dies to save the main character. *Ghetto dweller - The ghetto dweller is similar to a modern-day spook. He tries to act cool and intimidating throughout the film only to cower in fear when things get to scary. *Seductress - This femme fatale-inspired character tries to seduce the main character in an effort to distract him. Usually the seductress does not have sex with the main character. She is just teases him. *Authority figure - This character is placed in the film to promote a positive stereotype of African Americans. They tend not to have that much effect on the actions of the main character and are not that important in the overall story line. *Brute - The brute rarely speaks but he tends to be very sexual, especially with white woman. *Voice of reason - This character is older than all the rest. Therefore, he has the most wisdom and should be listened to. He knows what is going to happen if the main characters do not heed his advice. *Sidekick - This character is just along for the ride. He or she does not have any real defining characteristic. They usually merely stick around with the main character and wait for their time to die. *Rapper - This is a newer character that came about when blaxploitation horror films shifted to a more urban audience. His life span is tends to be based upon his popularity and fan base. His character tends to be similar to his rapper persona. *Star - The star is the protagonist of the film and tends to live throughout the film. All the other characters listed above help this character achieve safety and play a role in guiding them throughout the movie.

Social impact Blaxploitation horror films are a way for African Americans to maintain a cultural identity that the white media has been trying to take away from them. Harry M. Benshoff, a professor of film at the University of North Texas, describes blaxploitation horror films as, \\"address[ing] the specific fantasy needs of the black social imaginary.\\" In other words, these films are helping to portray what the African American community wants to see in their community. These films were meant to be a form of identification and empowerment to the black community and to help overcome racial bias.Benshoff, Harry M. \\"Blaxploitation Horror Films: Generic Reappropriation or Reinscription?\\" Muse. University of Texas Press, 2000. Web. 15 Feb. 2011. . Many of the monsters portrayed in these films can be seen as representations of black power and black pride. They also tend to push the boundaries of human sexuality. Much of the plot tends to be driven by sex. These films are also more open and accepting of homosexuals and these horror films tend to draw large homosexual audiences. It is believed that the homosexual community is drawn to these films because they can relate to the oppression that the African American community has and is feeling to this day. Characters that are seen as stereotypically \\"normal\\" are often rejected by the audience because they are not as easy to relate to. These characters would include the authority figure (mentioned above) and heterosexual couples. While these characters are often able to be related to in mainstream media, oppressed people tended to see them as a representation of their oppressors.Anolik, Ruth Bienstock, and Douglas L. Howard. \\"Part I: Demonizing the Racial Other, Humanizing the Self.\\" The Gothic Other: Racial and Social Constructions in the Literary Imagination. Jefferson, NC: McFarland &, 2004. 74. Print. Controversy While many people viewed blaxploitation horror as a celebration of African American culture others did not view them in such a positive light. People started to view these films as perpetuating negative stereotypes about the African American community. There were leagues formed to prevent the making of these types of films. Members of the NAACP founded The Coalition Against Blaxploitation Movies. They even went on to use radical tactics to stop the productions of certain films. William Crain stated in an interview that members of the Coalition Against Blaxploitation Movies tied him up in a chair and told him to leave his studio in an effort to stop production of one of his films.Paszylk, Bartlomiej. \\"Scream, Blacula, Scream (1973) and Horror Express (1973).\\" The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: an Historical Survey. North Carolina: McFarland &,, 2009. 125-30. Print. Many of the films portrayed African American males as a stereotype of hyper-sexual beasts who ravish and demoralize woman. They help to portray the fear that the white media has instilled in its viewers. These films depicting motifs of the African American male raping white women are seen as misogynists. Many of these horror films address the stereotype of African Americans partaking in bestiality. The monsters that African Americans portray in these films tend to be more animalistic compared with monsters in mainstream Hollywood films. The animalistic- like monsters supposedly go around terrorizing and having sex with the female actors in an effort to portray bestiality. As urban horror films emerged in the 1990s they began to portray African Americans as gangsters and thugs living in the \\"ghetto\\" that partake in illegal activities and take advantage of women.\\"1970's BLAXPLOITATION / HORROR HISTORY in 1970's Forum.\\" THE HORROR DRUNX - Horror Movie Message Boards Forums.

Many film production companies see the theme as a fad that has run its course and decided to stop funding the projects. While some directors have continued to produce these types of films, like Black Devil Doll From Hell and Tales from the QuadeaD Zone they were produced with a minimal budget and were poorly made. New York filmmaker Sean Weathers continues to make films in the blaxploitation horror genre. During the early 1990s a group of African American directors sought to revive the genre. hey put a modern twist on it by setting the films in urban areas. This helped spanned the wave of the urban horror film.

The studio was founded in 1996 by Ben Beck, Dave Harting, Doug Marsden and Glen Walter. Since then the company has designed products and experiences across multiple categories: from consumer goods and housewares, to electronics, medical machinery, sporting goods, and furniture. The company has between 11 and 20 employees providing services including Industrial Design, Mechanical Engineering, Communication Design, Business Strategy, and Design Research. The company has developed an unusual business model, in which the traditional fee for service work is supplemented with licensing and royalties-driven work. The studio has licensed a wide range of its own consumer products. Much of their early licensing work was for products in the pet industry. Working with Aspen Pets, the company designed the walkabout retractable dog leash. Later, the company designed Petmate cat litter boxes such as the Clean Step Litter Box, which is enclosed to prevent the cat from trailing litter out of the box and to provide added privacy for the pet. They developed Burton‚Äôs snowboarding step-in boot technology, SI and PSI, when the company was emerging as an early leader in equipment for the sport. Since designing the SI line, ELEVEN has continued to work with Burton on their binding designs, and provided periodic platform overhaul. The company teamed up with STX Lacrosse to design a Gary Gait signature line. The company also designed OXO's barware line, incorporating the Good Grips technology into drinking paraphernalia. The studio has worked with Procter & Gamble on household products and strategic brand innovation for brands including Cascade, Gillette, Secret, Duracell, Febreze, Tide, Vicks, Mr. Clean, Folgers and Sunny D.

It, along with the Veterans Memorial Building and two other buildings, is a contributing property to the May's Island Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The courthouse is the third building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History The county's first courthouse was built for $40,000 in 1842 in Marion. The building was two stories tall and constructed of brick. As Cedar Rapids vied for Marion to be the county seat a second courthouse was built in Marion in 1855. Cedar Rapids deeded a plot of land to the county for a courthouse in 1919. Even though voters failed to support a $1.3 million bond referendum to build the courthouse the board of supervisors continued to plan for a new building. In 1922 voters passed a smaller bond referendum. The present courthouse was designed by Urbana, Illinois architect Joseph Royer in the Beaux-Arts style. with It was completed in 1925 for just under $500,000. Royer also designed the former county jail that sat behind the courthouse. The building sustained significant damage from a flood in 2008. Renovations of the building were completed in 2014. Architecture The Linn County Courthouse is a three- story Bedford stone structure built on a granite foundation. The building consists of a main block flanked by two short wings. Classical elements are found in the full entablature and the protruding, nine-bay entrance porch. Ten fluted columns in the Ionic order support the entablature and parapet. Decorative stone panels separate two floors of windows. A stone balustrade surrounds the terrace, and balconies on the first floor windows flank the entrance pavilion. The side elevations and the rear of the building provide a simpler appearance, but the cornice surrounds most of the building. The interior walls were built of travertine and marble covers the floors.

They are active mainly by day and are often seen basking on warm rocks. They are also found under logs and stones and in clay banks. They eat small insects, spiders and similar invertebrates. They often emerge from vegetation edges to hunt on beaches and open rocky areas. Reproduction Like most of the New Zealand native skinks, the moko skink does not lay eggs, but gives birth to live young. This appears to be an adaptation to living in a cool climate, where life is marginal for reptiles. Litters of up to eight are born around February.

He published primarily in the field of gynaecological cancer, and described Schiller's test and Schiller-Duval bodies.  Biography  Dr. Walter Schiller was born in Vienna in 1887, the only child of Friedrich and Emma Schiller, who were of Jewish descent. He studied in Vienna, working as a demonstrator of physiology under Sigmund Exner and pathology under Anton Weichselbaum. He received his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1912, and worked as a bacteriologist in the Bulgarian Army during the First Balkan War in the same year. He trained in pathology under Weichselbaum, and was a Medizinaloffizier in charge of a medical laboratory in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, serving in Bosnia, Russia, Turkey and Palestine. From 1918 to 1921 he was pathologist to the Second Military Hospital of Vienna, where he worked with Hans Eppinger. From 1921 to 1936 he was Director of Laboratories at the second Gynaecological Clinic of the University of Vienna, where he carried out studies on cervical cancer and developed his eponymous test. He published this work in German in 1927 and in English in 1933, and wrote one of the earliest papers on dysgerminoma in 1934. Schiller travelled extensively during the 1930s, lecturing in England, Dublin and the United States. In 1937 he emigrated to the United States with his wife and two daughters due to the threat of Nazism, working initially at the Jewish Memorial Hospital in New York City. He became Director of Pathology at the Cook County Hospital, Chicago in 1938, and started publishing on ovarian tumours in 1939.

The chapel's original purpose is unknown, but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court, or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population. It was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house, then later fell into disrepair. The walls still remain, with some traces of render on them internally, but there is no roof. It contains a 16th-century side chapel with a vault beneath, used as a burial chamber. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is \\"a substantially 12th-century structure\\" with the \\"unusual 16th-century vaulted south chapel\\". History and location The oldest parts of Capel Lligwy date from the first half of the 12th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north-west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the Normans to gain control of the island. The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint Jones, author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. Yates and Longley, authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of Penrhos Lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as \\"Hen Gapel Lligwy\\" (\\"hen\\" being the Welsh word for \\"old\\" and \\"capel\\" meaning \\"chapel\\"). The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce Lloyds. In 1999, the vault was used to record some \\"atmospheres\\" for the album \\"You Have Just Been Poisoned By The Serpents\\" by The Serpents, a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the Bunnymen, Super Furry Animals and Ectogram that was described by one journalist as \\"possibly the strangest pop group of all time\\". For a time, Capel Lligwy was used as a private place of worship for Lligwy House, a \\"venerable mansion\\" once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William Irby, 1st Baron Boston, in the 18th century. After the early part of the 18th century, however, the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair. The walls remain to gable level, with some traces of render on the inside, but the roof has gone. Capel Lligwy is in the Anglesey countryside near Llanallgo; the parish church of St Gallgo, Llanallgo is about away. Part of the churchyard wall remains, showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure, as often found with early churches. It is cared for by Cadw, the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales, and is open to the public. Architecture and fittings The south chapel, showing the entrance to the vault Capel Lligwy is built from rubble masonry; at about up the walls, the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks, showing where the 14th-century rebuilding started. The doorway is on the south side, headed by a plain arch, and dates from the 12th century. There is a stone bellcote at the west end. There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation would have sat) and the chancel (where the altar would have been located). There are no window openings on the north side, but there is a blocked opening to the east (about wide) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall. There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel. The vault, which is about , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel. Limestone slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above. A stone in the nave, about with a hole in the top, might once have been used as a churchyard cross. Assessment Capel Lligwy has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is \\"important as a substantially 12th- century structure, with some architectural details surviving from this early period\\", even though it is now in a \\"ruinous condition\\". Cadw (which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes the \\"unusual 16th-century vaulted south chapel\\". The 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey. She said that the architecture was of \\"the rudest kind, [which] bears testimony to its great antiquity.\\" She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins, and when it was dug out, the vault was discovered, \\"containing several human skeletons, which crumbled into dust, when exposed to the air\\".

He was born in Paris and attended Lyc√©e Louis-le- Grand, where he was awarded his aggr√©gation in 1912. Renouvin spent 1912-1914 traveling in Germany and Russia. Renouvin served as an infantryman in World War I and was badly wounded in action in April 1917, losing his left arm and the use of his right hand. Renouvin married Marie-Therese Gabalda (1894-1982) and worked as teacher between 1918 and 1920 at Lyc√©e d‚ÄôOrleans. Renouvin served as the director of the War History Library at the Sorbonne between 1920 and 1922, as lecturer at the Sorbonne between 1922 and 1933 and as a professor at the Sorbonne between 1933 and 1964. Shows German guilt in World War I Renouvin began his historical career specializing on the origins of the French Revolution, especially the Assembly of Notables of 1787 for which he was awarded his PhD. After World War I, he turned to the study of the origins of World War I. As a veteran whose body had been scarred by the war, Renouvin was very interested in knowing why the war had begun. In the interwar period, the question of responsibility of the war had immense political implications because the German government kept on insisting that because of the Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles was the \\"war guilt clause\\", the entire treaty rested upon Article 231, and if it could be proven that Germany was not responsible for the war, the moral basis of Versailles would be undermined. As such, the Ausw√§rtiges Amt had a War Guilt Section, devoted solely to proving that the Reich was not responsible for the war of 1914, and funded the work of Americans like Barnes who likewise was determined that it was the allies who were the aggressors of 1914. In 1925, Renouvin published two books, described as ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù by the historian David Robin Watson in The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing about World War I. In the first book, Les Origines imm√©diates de la guerre (28 juin-4 ao√ªt 1914), Renouvin showed that Germany was responsible for the First World War, and France had not started the war. In Les Origines imm√©diates de la guerre, Renouvin wrote about the origins of the war: > \\"Germany and Austria did not agree to accept any other solution other than > the resort to force; they decided on their plan deliberately and after > coolly considering all the possible consequences. With regard to the > immediate origins of the conflict, this is the fact that dominates all the > others\\".Renouvin, Pierre Les Origines imm√©diates de la guerre (28 juin-4 > ao√ªt 1914), Paris: A. Costes, 1925 p. 268. The American historian Jay Winter and the French historian Antoine Prost wrote in 2005 about Renouvin: \\"We have come back full circle to his position, published only seven years after the end of the conflict. One can only admire how scholarly and cautious he was, and how well his conclusions have stood the test of time\\". In the second book Les Formes du gouvernement de guerre, Renouvin offered a comparative political history of Germany and France in the First World War, describing how France was able under the strain of war to preserve her democracy, but in Germany, what small elements of democracy that had existed in 1914 had been swept away by military dictatorship by 1916, headed by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. Both books involved Renouvin in a polemical debate with the French left, German historians and German apologists like Harry Elmer Barnes, who claimed that it was France and Russia that were the aggressors in the July Crisis of 1914. In the 1920s, it was often claimed that from 1912 to 1914, there had been a strategy of Poincar√©-la-guerre (Poincar√©'s War) and that French President Raymond Poincar√© had, supposedly in conjunction with Emperor Nicholas II of Russia planned an aggressive war to dismember Germany. By a close study of the documents then available in the 1920s, Renouvin was able to rebut the charges of both Poincar√©-la-guerre and of Germany being a victim of Franco-Russian aggression, and subsequent research since then has confirmed Renouvin‚Äôs initial conclusions. Renouvin's work was funded by the French government to rebut the claims of the War Guilt Section of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, and French leftists attacked Renouvin for being an \\"official\\" historian, but Renouvin was critical of aspects of French prewar policy. He was the first historian to expose the French Yellow Book of 1914, a collection of diplomatic documents relating to the July Crisis, for containing forgeries. Renouvin described his work in 1929 as: > \\"Tens of thousands of diplomatic documents to read, the testimony of > hundreds of thousands of witnesses to be sought out and criticized, a maze > of controversy and debate to be traversed in quest of some occasional > revelation of importance-this is the task of the historian who undertakes to > attack as a whole the great problem of the origins of the World War\\". During the 1920s, one of the most popular historians on the subject of the July Crisis was the American Barnes, who was closely associated with and funded by the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War in Berlin headed by the prominent v√∂lkisch activist Major Alfred von Wegerer, a pseudohistorical research institute secretly funded by the German government, who had emerged as the world's leading advocate of the thesis that First World War was indeed Poincar√©-la-guerre. After publishing his book The Genesis of the World War in 1926, Barnes was invited by the former German Emperor Wilhelm II to visit him in his Dutch exile to thank him personally. An awestruck Barnes wrote back to describe his meeting with the former Kaiser: \\"His Imperial Majesty was happy to know that I did not blame him for starting the war in 1914.... He disagreed with my view that Russia and France were chiefly responsible. He held that the villains of 1914 were the International Jews and Free Masons, who, he alleged, desired to destroy national states and the Christian religion\\". Wilhelm's anti-Semitic remarks about the war being the work of the Jews set Barnes off in an increasing bizarre anti-Semitic search to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, a process that culminated after 1945 when Barnes become one of the world's first Holocaust deniers. Given that Renouvin and Barnes had markedly different views on who was responsible for the war and in light of Barnes's tendency to personally attack anyone whose views differed from him in the vituperative language possible, often accompanied by claims that Barnes's targets were just puppets of the Jews, Renouvin and Barnes became involved in a rancorous debate about just who was responsible for the war. Because the German government had published a selective and misleading collection of documents relating to the July Crisis, and the French government had not published any documents from the Quai d'Orsay, Renouvin's work was not widely accepted in the 1920s, but a fuller opening of the German archives after World War II has validated Renouvin's scholarship. Renouvin himself often complained in the 1920s and 1930s that the Quai d'Orsay's policy of keeping its archives closed while the Ausw√§rtiges Amt was publishing its archives made the former seem like it had something to hide and so made ordinary people all over the world more open to the German case. Renouvin himself took the lead in having the French archives opened and became the president of the French historical commission in charge of publishing the French documents relating to the July Crisis. Renouvin himself created a magazine relating to the subject, Revue d'histoire de la Guerre Mondiale (Review of the History of the World War), and he published another book on the subject, La Crise europ√©enne et la grande gueree (The European Crisis and the Great War), in 1934. Forces profondes In addition, Renouvin expanded his historical work to feature broader studies of international relations. In 1946, Renouvin published La Question d'Extr√™me Orient, 1840-1940 (The Question of the Far East, 1840-1940), which was followed by Histoire des relations internationales between 1953 and 1958, which covered international history from the Middle Ages to 1945. In 1964, Renouvin published, with French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle (1917-1994), Introduction √† l'histoire des relations internationales (Introduction to the History of International Relations). As a historian, Renouvin came to be more and more concerned with the broader social forces that influenced diplomatic history. Together with prot√©g√©s Duroselle and Maurice Baumont (1892-1981), he started a new type of international history that included taking into what Renouvin called ' (profound forces) like the influence of domestic politics on foreign policy. In many ways, Renouvin's work with forces profondes was the diplomatic historians' equivalent to the Annales school. L'Armistice de Rethondes In his 1968 book L'Armistice de Rethondes (The Armistice of Rethondes), Renouvin examined how World War I ended in November 1918. Renouvin argued that the armistice that ended the war on 11 November 1918 was a product of not only the military situation but also public opinion in the Allied nations and that the armistice predetermined many aspects of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919, thus ensuring that US President Woodrow Wilson had less for manoeuvre during the Paris peace conference than was often presumed. Renouvin maintained that after the failure of the Kaiserschlacht (\\"Emperor's Battle\\"), the \\"final offensive\\" that intended to win the war for Germany in the spring of 1918, the Allies had turned the tide and that from the summer of 1918, the Allies wer, slowly but surely pushing the Germans out of France. Renouvin noted that 8 August 1918 was the \\"black day of the German Army\\", as it marked the successful beginning of the Battle of Amiens, with the Canadian Corps of the British Expeditionary Force smashing through the German lines, leading to the Hundreds Days' Offensive with the French, British Commonwealth and American forces steadily advancing through Northern France and into Belgium. By October 1918, the Ottoman Empire had surrendered, Austria-Hungary had collapsed as a state following a French-led offensive in the Balkans under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey and America's enormous industrial capacity and manpower meant that Germany had no hope of victory in the long run even if it had somehow managed to stabilise the situation to its advantage in the fall of 1918. In October 1918, American forces had broken through at Verdun, leading to the much-feared \\"rupture\\" on the Western Front through which the Allies could advance. Renouvin argued that given the direction that the war had been taken by late 1918, \\"Plan 1919\\", Marshal Ferdinand Foch's plan for an offensive in the spring of 1919 to take the Allies straight to Berlin, would certainly have succeeded if it had been launched. In the midst of the disastrous situation for the Reich, the Kiel mutiny broke out with the sailors of the High Seas Fleet mutinying rather going on a \\"death cruise\\" in the North Sea, which was intended to see the High Seas Fleet destroyed in a battle with the Anglo-American Grand Fleet just so that German admirals could claim that the High Seas Fleet had not been useless in the war. Renouvin wrote that for the German elites, the High Seas Fleet mutiny was the final straw, which made them determined to end the war while something could be saved for the Reich, rather than see Germany destroyed forever as a great power and/or swept from power by the revolution that the mutiny had sparked. Renouvin noted that such was the determination of German elites to salvage something out of the catastrophe of 1918 that the German officer corps, which had been a bastion of monarchism, turned against the monarchy with Wilhelm's generals ordering him to abdicate. The Allies had made it clear that they would not sign an armistice with him under any conditions. Rwnouvin wrote that \\"Wilson did not know Europe\\" by ignoring the wishes of the Allies and American public opinion, which did not want any halfway measures that might allow Germany to fight again. Renouvin argued that Wilson had no masterplan for the peace, improvised his diplomacy in response to events and vastly overrated his personal powers of persuasion when it came to dealing with both friends and foes. Renouvin maintained that the armistice of 11 November 1918 was a muddled affair on both sides. The Germans signed the armistice only to end a losing war and were prepared to resume the struggle if an opportune moment occurred. For exactly that reason, French and the British had insisted on an armistice so harsh that Germany could never resume the war. Renouvin stated that Wilson wanted the Germany to continue to exist as a state because as long as it remained, the Allies needed US assistance, which gave Wilson leverage in negotiating a peace that would be favourable to US interests. Renouvin argued that at the same time, Wilson did not want Germany to resume its quest for \\"world power status,\\" which might one day threaten the United States and so Wilson was not the advocate of a generous peace towards Germany that English-speaking historians often liked to claim. To resolve the dilemma, Renouvin wrote that Wilson had agreed to the Anglo-French demand for a harsh armistice but at the same time promised the Germans that the Fourteen Points, a set of vague and idealistic war aims that he had introduced earlier in 1918, would be the basis of peace. Renouvin argued that the new leaders of Germany, knowing very well that they were defeated, were still committed to maintaining it as a great power. He wrote that for German elites, annexing Austria on the basis of self- determination that was promised in the Fourteen Points and having economic domination over Central and Eastern Europe were the best that could be managed in conditions of late 1918 and would be the basis for a revival of German power when the time came. Renouvin stated that the armistice of 1918 was the worst possible way to end the war since it codified a situation with too many clashing interests. French public opinion believed that France would annex the Rhineland after the war, an impression reinforced by the armistice's demand for the Allies to occupy the Rhineland, which occurred in December 1918. Soviet Russia's aim of spreading communism all over the world meant that the new Soviet regime could never be a constructive force in international relations. British leaders were worried that the November Revolution, which had toppled the German monarchy, might be the beginning of a broader revolutionary that would sweep over and bring commuism to all over Europe. Wilson's claim that he could make peace on the basis of the Fourteen Points and destroy German militarism forever was totally unrealistic. Renouvin wrote that signing an armistice with Germany meant that the German government was going to be the Allied partner for peace, even as an unequal partner. Once the fighting stopped on 11 November 1918, the pressure of public opinion, which did not want to see the war resumed, meant that the Allied leaders had to make a peace that the Germans would not reject out of hand. Renouvin argued that after the armistice, public opinion in the Allied nations changed, and ordinary people did not want to see the resumption of the war that had killed and wounded so many, which limited the options of the Allied leaders for peacemaking in 1919. Renouvin wrote of all the contradictions of the armistice, which created facts on the ground that were difficult to change and how the very differing interests of the powers became the basis of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. The compromise peace that displeased everyone since it did not destroy Germany as a great power but was so irksome enough to ensure that the Germans would never accept it as legitimate. Renouvin noted that the Allies had imposed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919, but the responsibility for fulfilling it rested with the Germans, who could scarcely be expected to embrace a treaty designed to block the them from \\"world power status\\" permanently. Renouvin further argued that the need to safeguard France's 'security\\" was incompatible with Germany's ambitions to become a world power. The compromise treaty provided France with the illusion that its security was safeguarded. However, it ensured that the basis for a revival of German power were in place. Renouvin concluded that it would have been better if the armistice of 1918 had not been signed and if the Allies had instead continued the war into 1919. His many disciples included not just French but also foreign historians as the famous Greek scholar Dimitri Kitsikis, in whose honour Greece created the Dimitri Kitsikis Public Foundation.

A breed association was formed in 1910, and a breed standard was established. The breed had a period of success between the First and Second World Wars, but after the war the industrialisation of agriculture and the advent of imported hybrid layer breeds led to rapid decline in its popularity.

Bernard was born at Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, the son of Francis Bernard, whose family had held the manor of Abington, Northamptonshire, for 200 years, and his wife Mary Woodhouse. He was admitted at the Middle Temple on 13 November 1615. He was Recorder of Huntingdon. In April 1640, Bernard was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Short Parliament. Samuel Pepys consulted him in 1661 about the bitter inheritance dispute over the nearby estate of Brampton, Cambridgeshire (Bernard as Lord of the Manor of Brampton was also Steward of the Manorial Court), which Samuel's uncle Robert had bequeathed to him, but which several other heirs also laid claim to. The following year he persuaded Samuel and his father to reach a compromise settlement with Samuel's uncle Thomas, who had claimed the Brampton property as his brother Robert's heir-at-law. Samuel liked both Bernard and his second wife Elizabeth Digby, and he later became friendly with Bernard's younger son William. Samuel's cousin and patron Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich disliked Bernard: his attitude was no doubt influenced by the bitter political feud between the Montagu and Bernard families for political control of Huntingdonshire. It was Sandwich who had Bernard dismissed from his Recordership in 1663. Samuel was concerned that despite their previous friendly relations this would cause Bernard to hold a grudge against him, due to his closeness to Sandwich. Bernard was Counsel for Cambridge University in 1646 and steward and judge of the Court of the Isle of Ely in 1649.

Recording and composition  Moody, Standard and Poor was recorded at Saltlands Studio in Brooklyn with recording engineer Geoff Sanoff and record producer Eli Janney. The band went through 40 different recordings from their rehearsals when selecting songs to work on for the album. According to guitarist and singer Sohrab Habibion, the songs are \\"shorter and more concise\\" than on the band's 2009 debut album I Blame You: \\"We didn't intend to do that, but that's what we saw happening. It came down to 'How quickly can we get to the point, get in then get out of the song?' The sound of the record is a little more open. It sounds like you're in the room with the band live, which I think is a really nice sound.\\" Owing to throat problems, singer and guitarist Rick Froberg altered his vocal technique on the album, shifting from a yelling to a melodic style. Reception Moody, Standard and Poor received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 73% based on 15 reviews. Mark Deming of Allmusic remarked that the album \\"suggests that they still haven't resolved the minor flaws that dogged I Blame You, but this time around that seems to matter less ... The best songs on Moody, Standard and Poor are the ones that let the Obits indulge in the interplay that's their musical reason to be, and when they lock in on 'You Gotta Lose,' 'I Want Results,' 'Beggin' Dogs,' and 'New August,' they sound like the first really great guitar band to emerge from the indie underground in years.\\" Jonah Bayer of Alternative Press said that \\"With their second full- length, these Drive Like Jehu and Hot Snakes alumni have peeled back the distorted layers to get to what lies at their core: seasoned songwriting.\\" David Pott-Negrine of Drowned in Sound praised the timeless sound of the album: \\"Moody, Standard and Poor somehow manages to sound both old and new, like finding out a lost classic is actually a hot new band. Realistically, it could have been written and released at any point in the last 50 years.\\" Several critics complemented the sense of sonic space portrayed on the album. Bayer commented that \\"While Moody, Standard and Poor features everything from surf-inflected rockers ('Everything Looks Better in the Sun') to post- everything spaghetti Westerns ('New August'), the real brilliance lies in the sonic subtleties. It's all about perfect guitar tones, what frontman Rick Froberg doesn't say and the space Obits give their songs to breathe‚Äîeven though it's evident it's not for lack of technical ability.\\" \\"There‚Äôs a lot of space\\", remarked Pott-Negrine, \\"The songs are allowed to breathe. Nothing is hectic or in your face, or trying to grab your attention. There's no yelling. There's barely any distortion. A second listen reveals that there is something going on here; that there‚Äôs something bubbling under the surface, working its way under your skin.\\" Christopher Weingarten of The Village Voice remarked that \\"If 2009's I Blame You was a stripped-down, bratty MC5 tantrum, then follow-up Moody, Standard and Poor is a more focused Wipers implosion. With surf licks and lo-fi bristle poking through their hooks, it's a gritty blast with a sunny center.\\" Joe Gross of Spin commented that \\"There's certainly nothing fashion-forward on their second album, and thank goodness. These indie lifers rededicate themselves to the sound of Froberg's gritty yell, backed by a no-bullshit rhythm section, and interlocking, almost clean guitars.

In 1965, the school's boundary lines were changed, and black students first began attending classes. This action led to sporadic violence during the period from 1965 to 1969, leading eventually to several more serious events which occurred over a 3‚Äìyear period beginning in 1969. In the summer of 1966, Martin Luther King Jr led open housing marches in the Marquette Park neighborhood located just south of the school in order to protest discrimination against blacks in housing caused by illegal red-lining real estate practices.

By the 12th day of the boycott, the Board of Education requested for the parents to end the boycott and register the students; which would result in knowing the exact figure of overcrowding at the school. The school board had proposed a plan to send white students to another area high school and black students to Hyde Park High School, which parents declined.

Mission to the Holy Land Following the death of Robert the Bruce in 1329, his companion Sir James Douglas (aka the \\"Black Douglas\\"), set out to fulfil the King's last wish, that his heart be taken to the Holy Land, to be deposited in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. King Robert's heart was placed in a silver casket, which was carried by Sir James.

Seven Centuries - A History of the Lockharts of Lee and Carnwath. Scotland, 1976 It is Simon Macdonald Lockhart's assertion that the two knights, with six other knights and twenty-six squires and gentlemen, set out from Montrose in 1329, although records indicate they departed in 1330. Stopping a Sluys in Flanders, they heard of the crusade of Alfonso XI of Castile against the Muslim Emirate of Granada. Sailing to Seville, they joined Alfonso's army as it set off to besiege the castle of Teba on the border of Granada. At some point during the siege, during a confrontation with the Moorish relief force, the Scottish party came to grief. Most of the Scots knights were killed, including Sir James Douglas, Sir William St. Clair of Rosslyn and Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig. The body of Sir James, and the casket, were recovered from the field, and were allegedly carried back to Scotland by Sir Symon Locard and Sir William Keith of Galston, although the latter is the only named survivor mentioned in contemporary sources. Origin of the surname Lockhart Ceiling painting of the Lockhart arms at the Tower of Hallbar, Lanarkshire It is said that, following these events, Sir Symon changed his surname to Lockheart, later Lockhart, as the only holder of the key to the locked casket. He added a heart and fetterlock to the family coat of arms, and the motto Corda Serrata Pando: \\"I open locked hearts\\". Sir Symon lived into his 70s, dying in 1371 at the beginning of the reign of Robert II (1371‚Äì1390). The Lee Penny According to legend, during the battle of Teba Sir Symon captured a wealthy Emir, whom he held ransom. When the emir's mother came to ransom him, she paid with an amulet, which she claimed had medicinal properties. The amulet could be dipped into water to make the water antipyretic, for fever reduction, and hemostatic to restrict bleeding. Sir Symon made use of the amulet in Spain and in Scotland, and its healing powers became widely known. The amulet became known as the Lee Penny, after the family seat of Lee Castle near Lanark, and remains in the possession of the Lockhart family. The story of the Lee Penny formed the basis for Sir Walter Scott's 1825 novel The Talisman.

After the town was rebuilt, the newspaper office moved into the two-story brick building built by Drury Wilkerson (1836-1928) to house his general store on the southeast corner of North and Main streets. The building, which is still standing, is the most prominent building in Seligman's historic downtown was locally nicknamed \\"The Brick.\\" By 1972 the population of Seligman had greatly contracted by about a third from the size it had been when the Seligman Sunbeam was first founded (from around 600 to 424), largely due to the termination of passenger rail service to the town between 1958 and 1960, leaving the newspaper on the verge of extinction. Around this time a self- styled prophet named Edward Aloysius Roberts, known as Bab, purchased the paper. Roberts claimed he was the voice for a deity or entity he called Delamer Duverus. The focus of the newspaper greatly changed at this point. It no longer covered local news, but instead published extreme anti-Semitic and conspiracy theories.The Next Voice You Hear; American Sunbeam; September 5, 1977 In this newspaper and his additional writings and publications, including his book The Golden Reed, which he authored under the name Delamer Duverus, he attacked people of the Jewish faith and talked extensively about evil spirits and corrupt government.The Mind Slaves; by Delamer Duverus; 1979.

He led four expeditions from Minnesota to Montana in the 1860s. Early life Fisk was born in New York of Irish extraction, the eldest of six sons of John B. and Jerusha T. Fisk. He worked as a \\"raftsman, farmer, carriage maker, and newspaperman\\" for the Daily Courier of Lafayette, Indiana. Four of his five brothers also became newspapermen. Becoming engrossed with the western frontier, he moved to White Bear Lake, Minnesota sometime in the 1850s, married Lydia Burson, and started farming. In 1857, he was in the expedition of William H. Nobles which tried unsuccessfully to build a wagon road from Fort Ridgely to South Pass. Later, he was the secretary of the Dakota Land Company, which promoted settlement along the road. Civil War service In 1861, he enlisted in the Third Minnesota Volunteer Infantry as a private. An undisciplined soldier, on May 19, 1862, he was called to Washington, DC, where he was \\"commissioned captain and assistant quartermaster of volunteers in the quartermaster corps\\" and \\"appointed superintendent of emigration ... on a route between Fort Abercrombie, Dakota, and Fort Walla Walla, Washington\\", a political appointment engineered by influential Minnesotans interested in promoting the settlement of the west. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton instructed him to \\"organize and outfit a corps for the protection of emigrants 'against all dangers' that might beset their way west.\\" He was authorized to enlist 50 men for this purpose. He had little supervision in his new responsibilities: > Fisk was commissioned in the quartermaster corps, yet the quartermaster kept > no financial records of his activities; he was on detached duty under > assignment from the secretary of war, yet he was a volunteer and owed his > appointment to influence from Minnesota; he was ordered to report regularly > to the adjutant general, yet he had no immediate superior who was at all > concerned with what he was doing. His Western duties were of no great > importance to the war department in its preoccupation with the larger > concerns of the Civil War. =1862 expedition= His budget was relatively small; $5000 was deposited to his account and, at the end of his journey, he was expected to auction off his wagons, animals and other equipment. A careless man where money was concerned, Fisk did not clear all of his incurred debts until years afterward. Fisk reached St. Paul, Minnesota on June 4 and placed an advertisement for emigrants in the Pioneer and Democrat. He secured the services of experienced guide Pierre Bottineau, who had guided the earlier Stevens Expedition of 1853. According to Nathaniel P. Langford, \\"E. H. Burritt was first assistant, the writer second assistant and commissary, and Samuel R. Bond was secretary. Among the guards were \\"David E. Folsom, Patrick Doherty (Baptiste), Robert C. Knox, Patrick Bray, Cornelius Bray, Ard Godfrey, and many well known pioneers of Montana.\\" The party set out from St. Paul on June 16 and followed the same route Stevens had taken. They celebrated the Fourth of July at Fort Abercrombie, where Fisk found more emigrants waiting for him. A total of \\"117 men, 13 women, 53 wagons, 168 oxen, 17 cows, 13 saddle horses, 14 team horses, and 8 mules\\" were in Fisk's care when they departed on July 7. They reached what is now Wells County, North Dakota on July 19, Fort Union on August 9, and their destination near Fort Benton in what is now Montana on September 5. Here, Fisk's duty ended, but as he had been instructed to sell his equipment at Walla Walla, he accompanied the emigrants further unofficially. 82 people split off to prospect for gold at Prickly Pear Creek, while a smaller group continued on to the gold fields of the Salmon River, leaving only three wagons and 14 men to accompany Fisk to Walla Walla. Fisk returned to Washington and turned in his official report to the Adjutant General's office on February 17, 1863. After the Secretary of War presented it to Congress, five thousand copies were ordered printed. Minnesota Senators Morton S. Wilkinson and Henry M. Rice and Representatives Cyrus Aldrich and William Windom applauded his success, and Fisk was authorized to lead a second expedition, with a somewhat larger budget. =1863 expedition= Because of Indian unrest, Fisk's second expedition mustered only 60 or 62 people, and many of them were on his payroll. The group departed from Fort Ripley, Minnesota on June 25. Fisk took a route to the north of his previous path due to widespread drought. The party reached the vicinity of Fort Benton on September 7. An old prospector gave Fisk some gold nuggets to take back to President Abraham Lincoln as a present. Fisk put them in an old valise, which fell out unnoticed near Salt Lake City on the stagecoach ride back, necessitating a search back to find it. Upon his return to Washington on February 23, 1864, he was promptly arrested for not having a pass. He also got into trouble for not reporting to military headquarters. On February 29, he presented the gold nuggets to Lincoln in the White House. Fisk was further dogged by two separate complaints, one regarding an unpaid draft used to purchase oxen during the second expedition, and the other by the Overland Stage Line over alleged misconduct of Fisk and his men on the trip to Washington. Despite these troubles, Fisk was once again appointed superintendent of the northern route, though later than the superintendents of other routes. The Secretary of War instructed him to follow a path specified by Congress, despite an attempt by Senator Wilkinson to change it to a shorter route. =1864 expedition: Attacked by Sitting Bull= Because of his late appointment and start, Fisk returned to Minnesota to find that many of the emigrants had tired of waiting for him and had departed in a separate group. Nonetheless, he set out with the remainder (ignoring the route he had been ordered to take) and reached Fort Rice on the Missouri River. There, Fisk asked for and obtained an army escort, 47 soldiers of Company A, Dakota Cavalry, commanded by Lieutenant Smith. The enlarged party, including 200 emigrants and 88 wagons, set out from the fort on August 23. On September 2, one wagon overturned. Nine soldiers and two other wagons remained at the scene while repairs were made; the rest of the wagon train proceeded on. The small isolated group was found and attacked by Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux. In the fighting, Sitting Bull was shot in the hip. Hearing the gunfire, Fisk and about 50 men hurried back from the main body. Scout Jefferson Dilts charged forward recklessly and shot as many as six Sioux before being killed by arrows. Fisk and the others held off the Native Americans until sunset, then snuck back to the main group. Ten soldiers, Dilts, and another civilian had been killed, while the Sioux had lost six. The next day, the Sioux attacked again, forcing the expedition to corral their wagons. They constructed sod walls for \\"Fort Dilts\\" and defended themselves against 400 attackers without further casualties. They had access to a source of water, and there were ample supplies in their wagons. After several unsuccessful attacks, the Sioux opened negotiations under a flag of truce via notes written by Fanny Kelly, a woman they had taken captive in July. They offered her and safe passage in exchange for supplies. Fisk bid \\"three horses, flour, sugar, and coffee for her, but the Lakotas wanted forty head of cattle and four wagons\\", and the trade was off. (A few months later, Fanny Kelly was either released by Sitting Bull or, by her account, escaped; she later wrote a popular book of her experiences, Narrative of My Captivity Among the Sioux Indians, in 1871.) On the night of September 5, Lieutenant Smith and 13 men rode to Fort Rice for reinforcements. An annoyed Brigadier General Alfred Sully dispatched 900 men on September 18. On September 20, the Fisk party was escorted back to the safety of Fort Rice, whereupon the expedition disbanded. While Fisk was viewed favorably by civilians, to the military authorities, he had committed \\"gross military offenses\\" and was \\"too reckless and too ignorant to be trusted.\\" Fisk submitted his report to the Adjutant General on January 13, 1865, and returned to Washington in February with his wife and their child. On May 22, with the war coming to an end and a new administration in office following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Fisk tendered his resignation from the army. He was discharged on June 12. When the Fisk family departed the city, they left behind an unpaid $850 hotel bill. 1866 expedition Fisk was unable to organize a party in 1865, but the following year, he set out for Helena, Montana with his last and largest expedition. His brothers, Robert Emmett (1837‚Äì1908), Van Hayden (1840‚Äì1890), and Andrew Jackson Fisk (January 8, 1849 ‚Äì 1910), accompanied him, with Robert serving as his second in command and Van as wagon master. Also in the party was photographer William H. Illingworth, who shot 30 stereographs along the way, at least some of which still survive. According to an advertising pamphlet, Fisk wanted to depart on or about May 22 and hopefully no later than May 29 from St. Cloud, Minnesota to the \\"Great Gold Fields of Montana\\", with \\"Military Protection Guaranteed by the Government\\". Passage for one man with of baggage, and subsistence was set at $100. The expedition consisted of 500 people and 160 wagons. It left Fort Abercrombie on the morning of June 16, reached Fort Berthold on July 19, and made its way to Fort Union on August 2. It arrived in Helena in September. Later life The Fisk brothers and their families settled in the Montana region and played a part in its development. Andrew and Robert published the Helena Herald newspaper, starting in 1866, with James as a co-editor from January to July 1867, and Van also employed by the paper. James was also involved with the Montana militia and various other ventures. Andrew served as Adjutant General of the Montana Territory under Governor B. Platt Carpenter; Robert edited the Herald for 36 years and was an active Republican supporter; and Van owned and published the Townsend Tranchant newspaper, and engaged in mining and farming. In 1902, James Liberty Fisk died in the Minnesota Soldiers Home in Minneapolis.

Charles Henry Douglass (February 1870‚Äì1940) was a leading businessman in Georgia State in his time and continues to be remembered today for his contributions to the African American community through his historical Douglass Theatre. He was a very wealthy man in his time and was a great community leader for equality. He was very reputable in the arts, for he was a part of TOBA (Theatre Owners Booker Association) and managed the Florida Minstrels and Comedy Company. He opened the Douglass Theatre in Macon, Georgia, and continued to be a prominent leader within his community. He ran his theatre until 1940 when he died. Throughout his life, Douglass made several contributions to his community and city.Digital Library of Georgia \\"Indeed, thanks to the vision of Charles Henry Douglass, the Douglass Theatre in Macon became a preeminent entertainment venue for African American Georgians outside of Atlanta. Today, with the restored Douglass Theatre again in operation, the inspiring legacy of Charles H. Douglass lives on in Macon\\". Early life Charles Henry Douglass was born on February in 1870 in Macon, Georgia. His father, Charles Douglass, was a former slave from Virginia who became a carpenter. Charles grew up with his father, his mother Ellen, and his two sisters in a one bedroom house that his father built.Douglass Theatre ‚Äì History To supplement the family income, Charles worked at a very young age peddling wood and vegetables. He also chopped cotton for fifteen cents a day. Since a young age, Douglass had interest in the arts and theatre. After his parents died, he continued to work and supported his sisters until they married. Soon after his sisters were married he left Macon and worked a series of various jobs. Cultural Background Douglass was born in the fairly small city of Macon, Georgia. Macon is located in central Georgia and is a part of Bibb County. Macon has a vast history behind it and especially around Douglass' era. Andrew Manis, an author of Macon Black and White says, \\"In Macon, as elsewhere in the state, violence would be whites' first instrument in the effort to return blacks to their accustomed place\\".Manis, Andrew. Macon Black and White. Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 2004. Print. Thus showing that there was much unrest during this time period, and having the Douglass Theatre where African Americans could feel liberated through the arts. Work/ Political ties In this time of severe racism and segregation, Douglass took pride in working and serving the black community of Macon. In 1898 Douglass worked in a bicycle rent and repair shop, and was successful until the rise of the automobile. Then in 1901, he became the director of the Georgia Loan and Savings Company, where he met his future wife Fannie Appling. Fannie was an employee there, working as an assistant cashier. Douglass continued working for the company for four more years and then began to invest in other businesses. One of his first investments was the Ocmulgee Park Theatre in which he operated from 1904 to 1906. The Ocmulgee Theatre is home to the Ocmulgee Symphony Orchestra.Macon arts alliance Then in 1906, he sold the Ocmulgee Theatre and bought another building on Broadway Street, which is one of the main streets in Macon. Before purchasing this new building he had already owned The Colonial Hotel which was located on the same street. Douglass went on to own several pieces of real estate on Broadway Street. At this time in his life he really started to gain wealth and fame among the people of Macon. Douglass even became a member of the black chamber of commerce, and some would in which he was known as \\"‚Ä¶the city's wealthiest African American\\". Through this group he also helped organize various rallies, \\"They rallied black Maconites to meet on April 9, 1918 at the City Auditorium to collect money for the bond drive\\". With his growing power and authority during these racist times, Douglass was involved in many African American interest groups and gained positive fame from the black community as well as negative attention from the white community in Georgia. At one point, \\"the state Ku Klux Klan offered a $100 bounty on his head‚Ä¶\\". In fact, some describe him, \\"functioning as a wing of the Black Arts Movement\\".Williams, Mance. Black Theatre in the 1960s and 1970s. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1985. Print. Some also say, \\"Charles H. Douglass‚Ä¶was Macon's most prominent African American business leader in the first half of the twentieth century\\" (Washington Memorial Library). Douglass was a man who wanted to empower his community and stand up for what he believed in. There was one instance in which the Macon police chief arrested 30 men to explain why they were not active workers, and Douglass came to their defense. \\"Black business leader Charles H. Douglass pleaded for the release of the men, vouching for their characters and that they worked for some of the establishments along Broadway Street\\". This statement demonstrates Douglass' loyalty to his employees. Douglass then went on to organize and administer the \\"Florida Blossom Minstrels and Comedy Company\\" in 1907. However, in 1911 Douglass sold the company and management to one of his partners Peter Worthey. This was the start of Douglass' life in the theater industry. Comedy Company/ TOBA The Florida Blossom Minstrels and Comedy Company were fairly famous in its region. The company introduced Douglass to the main circuit of the most favored minstrel entertainers. The Company traveled to various locations performing and expanding their popularity. One of the more renowned members of the group was Pigmeat Markham. He received about $12.50 per week performing various songs and minstrel skits. The company really propelled Douglass in the industry and the experience greatly helped him with his later theatre endeavors. Theatre Douglass opened his soon to be historical theatre in 1911. With Douglass' prior knowledge of performers and the entertainment business, the theatre grew into a great success rather rapidly. Douglass was a member of TOBA (Theatre Owners Bookers Association) and his membership greatly aided in the success of the booking many of African American artists and performers. The TOBA consisted of a series of 40 theatres that helped one another booking and scheduling the performers. The theatre was a premier location for entertainment for African American citizens in Macon. It was a prime for its vaudeville hall along with its movie theatre. It was a common setting for early blues and jazz music. It showed several feature- length films subsequently became a much respected venue in the country for its time. It was also sometimes home to specific sporting events. In the 1920s it was the theatre was a significant venue for novel African American films. These films were written for black people and by black people. Most of the films supported the \\"by us, for us\\" ideal. Some musical artists that filled the stage were Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway. \\"When not hosting live acts, the Douglass also exhibited a wide variety of sound and silent motion pictures. Selected records feature race films (movies made specifically for African American audiences) of producers such as the Norman Film Manufacturing Company and Oscar Micheaux\\".grainger.uiuc.edu The theatre was also a common place for various groups to congregate in such a time of racial turbulence. Various black interest groups met there providing them with a respectively safe place. Later in 1999, the location served as a location for Ellis's town meetings and the panel discussions were aired live on local television stations. The theater was managed by Douglass himself until 1940 when he died. However, the theatre was leased to Benjamin Stein, a white business man for the short period between 1927 and 1929. After Douglass died, his wife and sons ran the theatre until it was closed in 1973. After being latent for several years, the Theatre was saved and renovated by a non-profit group known as \\"Friends of the Douglass Theatre\\" in the 1990s. The renovation consisted of the installation of a new heating and cooling system, sound and cinema equipment with surround sound, formats, and state-of-the-art lighting. Additionally new seating was installed and the main annex was rejuvenated. Currently, the theatre is home to the \\"Macon Film Guild at the Douglass Theatre\\". It is also home to Met Live in HD, a series of transmissions of live opera from the Metropolitan opera in New York City. It is open to the public and continues to be a main attraction. Talent Many famous artists and performers have had the honor of performing at the historical Douglass Theatre. In the early 1960s the theatre was a great place for musicians and performers to showcase themselves. Some of the music talent that have performed there are Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Otis Redding, James Brown, Little Richard, and Pigmeat Markham.Brown's Guide to Georgia It also housed some very renowned vaudeville shows as well.

He resided for the most part in Great Barrington, Massachusetts,Harwood, Frederick, pp. 17‚Äì19 but also spent a lot of time in Bermuda; Lugano, Switzerland; and Montecito, California. He was married twice, first to Harriet HaynesHarwood, Frederick, p. xx with whom he had three children (Marjorie, Edward, and Richard) and then to Helen FowleHarwood, Frederick, p.7 with whom he had four children (William, Eve, Frederick, and Katherine). When he died, he had thirteen grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.  Economics and philosophy of science  Harwood was an autodidact in economics in the style of Henry George, although he got two Masters degrees from RPI, one in civil engineering and one in business administration. Harwood's private studies on economics and on the philosophy of science began as a vocation in his early twenties, in the well-stocked libraries of the various Army bases where he resided. By 1928, he had become so learned that his articles on business and monetary conditions were published in well-known financial periodicals of the day such as The Annalist [sic] (a New York Times Company publication later sold to Business Week), Barron's, the Wall Street Magazine, Coast Investor & Industrial Review, Bankers Magazine, and others.Harwood, Frederick, p. xxi By the time he was 40, more than 80 articles had been published.\\"List of ECH Articles and Writings,\\" from the Harwood archives. His study of banking history and of the American economy convinced him in the late 1920s that the U.S. was headed for a crisis, and he predicted this in a number of his articlesHarwood, Frederick, pp. 8-9 (see a few listed below). In 1932 he wrote his first full-length book, Cause and Control of the Business Cycle, and it was published by the Financial Publishing Company of Boston, Massachusetts.Harwood, Frederick, p. 8 For its exposition of monetary phenomena in clear layperson's language, the book earned a recommendation of the Book-of-the-Month Club and was used as a college text by professors at Dartmouth and Stanford. The book sets forth his economic theories and gives Harwood's intricately derived but simply illustrated graph (the Harwood Index of Inflating) showing the amount of purchasing media in circulation, divided into various subcategories that are either \\"inflationary\\" or \\"noninflationary,\\" according to clearly explained definitions.Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, pp. 27-30 Harwood's detailed analysis of statistics and economic history led him to a number of what he considered to be \\"warranted assertions\\".Harwood, Edward, Useful Procedures, p. 8 One of these was the following: that two market-evolved monetary mechanisms functioned relatively well together, and they were the cornerstones of several healthy national economies, at least up until the creation of the Federal Reserve System. These two mechanisms were (1) the gold standard,Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, p. 22 and (2) what he called \\"sound commercial banking\\".Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, pp. 23-25 Sound commercial banking, in his view, required three things: (1) the separation of the commercial banking function from the investment banking function; (2) that commercial banks be the only entities allowed to create and issue self-liquidating money (or what he preferred to call \\"purchasing media\\"Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, p. 72) based only upon commercial transactions for things coming to market in the short term; and (3) that investment banking departments should not create money, but rather only issue credit based on real savings, which are, in fact, claims on existing things, i.e. delayed consumption. Harwood's analysis brought him to the further conclusion that the abandonment of the gold standard, the loss of sound commercial banking principles, and the subtle growth of the Federal Reserve's powers to create money in place and stead of the commercial banks would, in the long run, disrupt monetary equilibrium and undermine the U.S. dollar.Harwood, Edward, The Money Mirage, pp. 3-13; Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, p. 59 He defined purchasing media for the academic community in very specific terms.Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, pp. 3-4 However, for the layperson, he recommended that people think of purchasing media as coins, paper currency, or checks that are claims on goods or services,Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, pp. 19-20 much as is implied in the expression \\"promissory notes.\\" He used the metaphor of a baggage claim check.Harwood, Edward, pp. 19-20 Banks issuing paper notes should only do so, he claimed, in direct ratio to the amount of gold in their vaults (under a gold standard) and to the things their customers were bringing to market; and any issuance above that amount would be, by definition, \\"inflationary,\\" i.e. it will tend to cause price increases over and above those caused by direct cause-effect relationships among normal supply and demand forces.Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, pp. 25-26 Such \\"inflationary\\" price increases are different from those caused, for example, by a shortage of supply or by a rise in demand, because they are caused by a devaluation of the purchasing media itself through excessive issuance.Harwood, Edward, Cause & Control, p. 38 Not only did Harwood predict the Great Depression, but he was one of the first investment advisors to steer his clients into gold-related investments before the 1970s dollar devaluation and abandonment of the gold standard. By the late 1950s Harwood had concluded that monetary policy would lead to the depreciation of the dollar.Research Reports, June 10, 1957 By 1958 his research noted an outflow of gold from the U.S. and the beginning of an increase in the gold price on the London market.Research Reports, April 21, 1958 By September 1958 he was predicting another devaluation of the dollar and began recommending the purchase of gold mining shares to protect one's savings.Investment Bulletin, September 15, 1958 This fact probably makes him one of the original Gold Bugs of the 20th century. BRC, the nonprofit Harwood created with Lundberg and Dodd, set forth a set of rules for the methodology to be used in the social (otherwise known as behavioral) sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics), which rules are similar to those so effectively used in the harder sciences (e.g., physics, biology, chemistry).Harwood, Frederick, p. 44 What BRC referred to as the \\"transactional approach\\" (not to be confused with Transactional Analysis), followed very specific procedures of inquiry best described by John Dewey and Arthur F. Bentley in their book, Knowing and the Known.Harwood, Frederick, p. 44-45 Harwood also studied and adhered to some of the work of Charles Sanders Peirce and William James.Welcome, pp. 3-4 Early in his life, Harwood developed great respect for the Founding Fathers of America and for their forebears, who had developed a wise reverence for certain individual liberties, property rights, the sanctity of contracts, and the necessity to limit government from its own expansive tendencies; and for the protections of all of these that are embodied in the U.S. Constitution.AIER, \\"Welcome,\\" c.p. 7 His clear explanations of complicated monetary phenomena helped thousands of readers understand economic events and enabled them to preserve the value of their savings throughout the 20th century's monetary experiments on and off the gold standard. A couple of years before his death, Harwood was honored by becoming the first of three living economists to have his likeness engraved on a gold piece.Harwood, Frederick, p. 68 The others were Nobel prizewinner Friedrich Hayek and well known economics author Henry Hazlitt. Harwood's colleagues nicknamed him \\"the George Washington of the modern sound money movement\\".Harwood, Frederick, p. 83 AIER continues to serve the public today.

George Thomson's business prospered and the family lived in the prestigious Monteith Row, but as the industrialisation of Glasgow continued a pace, the Thomsons like many others moved from the grime and dirt of the east end to the leafier suburbs of Glasgow's West end, in the Woodlands area.

It was formed in 1977 by 63 schools from most of the major college football conferences and selected schools whose football programs were independent of any conference. One by one, the major conferences (and Notre Dame, the most prominent independent program) would eventually negotiate their own separate TV deals, reducing the importance of the CFA. The CFA shut down in 1997. History =Background= In 1977, when the CFA was formed, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had controlled all college football TV rights since the early 1950s. It limited the number of games shown on TV because of a concern that televising more games would hurt attendance. The schools that formed the CFA banded together because of what they viewed as obstructionism of the NCAA by smaller schools. \\"People were just fed up with the NCAA's parochialism, power grab, etc., but also they wanted more money, they wanted to maximize and they wanted their fans to be able to see them on TV,\\" said James Ponsoldt, a law professor at the University of Georgia. The CFA was formed by schools from the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Eight Conference, the Southeastern Conference, the Southwest Conference, and the Western Athletic Conference, plus independents Notre Dame, Penn State, Pittsburgh, West Virginia, and the service academies. Schools from the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-8 Conference did not join the CFA. After the CFA negotiated its own TV deal in 1981, the NCAA threatened sanctions against any colleges participating in the CFA deal, in all sports, not just football. The Universities of Georgia and Oklahoma, two prominent members of the CFA, sued the NCAA in U.S. District Court, seeking an injunction that would prevent the NCAA from imposing sanctions against CFA members, and asserting that the NCAA was engaged in restraint of trade and price-fixing. On June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma that the NCAA's television plan violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf. Together with the growth of cable television, this ruling resulted in the explosion of broadcast options currently available. So beginning in 1984, the CFA sold a television package to ABC and CBS. The Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their own separate package to ABC. =Decline= By 1990, the television landscape changed. ABC had both the CFA and Big Ten‚ÄìPac-10 packages, and in 1991, Notre Dame split from the CFA to sign an exclusive deal with NBC. The CFA was once again relegated to limited appearances. The beginning of the end for the CFA occurred in 1995, when the Southeastern Conference and Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS. Since CBS began covering the SEC exclusively in 2001, the SEC is the only major conference guaranteed a national \\"game of the week\\" on network television as FOX and ESPN have the rights to multiple conferences (although the SEC's primary broadcast partner is CBS).Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 The CFA was officially terminated on June 30, 1997.

The woman, Linda, who picks him up is actually a prostitute on her way to some clients.

The confrontation does not bode well for Gordone, for after a little tussling he is knocked out and falls to the ground. He wakes up to find that he has been charged for the murder of one of the bikers whom he had confronted earlier.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079709/ Gordone is sent to jail and becomes cellmates with a man who goes by the nickname of \\"Half Dead\\". While in his cell, Gordone has to defend himself from constant advances from the brute. The two battle it out in the cell until the walls are covered with sweat and blood. The wailing and begging attracts a lot of attention from other inmates, who cheer for \\"Half Dead\\" to rape the newcomer, but in fact Gordone manages to subdue his assailant and rises triumphantly, telling everybody to \\"back off\\". Gordone is then put in another cell, his new cellmate being an older man going by the nickname \\"Seldom Seen\\", who has been in this jail for 35 years (adding up to 50 years as he spent another 15 years in jail in his youth), and has developed his own personal wisdom, out of sheer survival concern, considering himself \\"the freest man in the world\\" for he learned how to control his desires and focus on his core self. Gordone and \\"Seldom Seen\\" develop a genuine friendship. Shortly afterward, an illegal boxing tournament is organized in the prison, led by Lieutenant Arnsworth. The winner of the tournament will be allowed to leave the prison on early parole because Lieutenant Arnsworth can pull a few strings on the parole board, and Gordone feels as though he would be able to win it. The only thing that stands in his way is a man by the name of Jesse \\"The Bull\\" Amos, who is in charge of everything within the prison and is the leader of the prison's strongest gang. \\"Seldom Seen\\" agrees to be Gordone's trainer.

Is that what you think of yourself: somebody's property?\\" ::Eugene: \\"Aw, come on, man. You know what's happening. Everybody knows what's happening. I've been, as they say, 'tampered with.'\\" The dialogue brings to mind the ideology of previous decades which held that African Americans were simply property, and therefore had no rights.Cluskey, M. Political Text-Book or Encyclopedia. Washington: Cornelius Wendell, 1857. Print. That idea was a precursor to the later segregation period of American history and the director was wise enough to introduce this aspect of that history into the dialogue of a movie based in prison. More important than the reflection of the trend on the widescreen are the things that go on behind the scenes, which Fanaka clearly demonstrated in the film (though certain attributes are strictly fictional, like early parole by winning the fights). Home media Both the original film and its first sequel were released on DVD by Xenon Entertainment in 2000. Both films contain an audio commentary by writer/director Jamaa Fanaka and are currently out of print. They were subsequently re-released by Xenon on DVD in 2006. Both films were released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome in 2018. ArrowDrome DVD re-released the film in February 2012 in the United Kingdom. The releases carry over the aforementioned commentary by Fanaka and include a collector's booklet. Sequels Fanaka produced two sequels to the film over the ensuing decade. The first sequel, Penitentiary II, was released in 1982. It was a direct sequel that followed the exploits of \\"Too Sweet\\" Gordone shortly after his release from prison. It was notable for the early casting of Mr. T as Gordone's trainer, Glynn Turman as his brother-in-law, and Ernie Hudson recast in the villainous role of \\"Half Dead\\". The film was released theatrically in the United States by MGM in April 1982 and grossed $3,178,542 at the box office. The second sequel, Penitentiary III, was released in 1987.

Woolf uses this money to embezzle it, where from Crowder decides to take the case and follows the fugitive from Los Angeles, California to San Francisco, California.

Crowder is a strong black man, and makes sure that everyone around him knows this. This aspect of the movie may represent a sort of ironic situation in that Crowder boasts about his strength and physical prowess with the women, which are animal-like characteristics, yet also demands to be seen as more than just what the white man has made him out to be.Alexander, George. ‚Äò‚ÄôWhy We Make Movies: Black Filmmakers Talk About the Magic of Cinema‚Äô‚Äô. New York: Harlem Moon, 2003. Print. Crowder often encounters many women whom he has sexual relations with shortly after meeting them. His slick lines and tough guy attitude sweeps the ladies right off their feet so that at the end of all of these sexual encounters the women are often seen begging for more sex. This stereotype was a common blaxploitation characteristic to use in African American films.  Distribution  Atlas Films ‚Äì The film was primarily targeted at African- Americans in suburban areas across the United States of America and to those primarily situated in western and eastern suburban areas.  Historical significance  This film is part of a larger genre known as blaxploitation which emerged in the early 1970s in the time when many black exploitation films were being made specifically to target black audiences. No Way Back emerged as one of these blaxploitation films in 1976 and was set on the West Coast, which typically as many other blaxploitation films like it took place in the ghetto. This was a common characteristic of blaxploitation films which accentuated crime, drug deals, and pimps.Blaxploitation Another important aspect of this particular movie is the pun with the name Jesse Crowder which plays on Jim Crow Laws, an important and controversial aspect of earlier African American life. Only a little over a decade before the film was made it had actually been legal to segregate black and whites in public institutions as well as in other places in society (this play on words is prevalent in blaxploitation films)Rausch, Andrew. ‚Äò‚ÄôTurning Points in Film History‚Äô‚Äô. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2004. Print. These laws eventually led to one of the greatest court decisions in this country's history known as Brown v. Board of Education in which the Warren Court held that separate but equal learning facilities was unconstitutional and therefore overturned the previous court decision of Plessy v. Ferguson. Aside from the main characters name the other characters names also have a great deal of importance. The fugitive for example possesses a strong white American name, Henry, yet in this movie the man with the white name is portrayed as the bad guy, and the source of all the corruption and greed in the world.Think Baby Names - ‚ôÇ Henry His surname is coincidentally Pickens, which could be associated with the hard labor that slaves had to do before Fred Williamson's time. It also brings to mind all of the hardships which were faced during the time of slavery, as well as the slightly improving segregation period of American History. The film also works on a secondary level, which is in the subjugation of women. This element is evident in the film when Crowder has sexual relations with some women throughout the movie. These women are often left begging for more sex which was the foundation of many blaxploitation films. This of course leads to anti- women sentiments as one of the movie‚Äôs catchphrases is \\"Never trust a woman with her clothes off!\\" Another of this films quotes is ‚ÄúYou pay the bill. I‚Äôll deliver it, legal, illegal, moral or otherwise!‚ÄùWrong Side of the Art! - No Way Back (1976, USA) This is symbolic of the economic situations which had been crippling the culture of the United States. This was in part because major companies were committing crimes, were employing policies of segregation, and were able to get away with it because of their favorable financial situations. This powerful quote also demonstrates the ideology of the time and the stereotypes with which white American's described African Americans. Apart from being seen as inferior, African-Americans (as well as many other minorities) were seen as utter savages and because of this most Americans believed that they lacked the inability to distinguish between things that would be considered legal or illegal. One blaxploitation film that accentuates this barbarian belief is Spike Lee's Bamboozled. An important event in this film which occurs fairly on in the films runtime is when Mr. Pickens robbed the bank and flees with the stolen money. He then chooses to embezzle that money which he had just stolen, which logically makes no sense at all, but if this event is thought of symbolically it could represent the ideals and thoughts of the culture of that time, which held that whites were notoriously corrupt individuals. It could also be thought of as an allusion to American companies which were committing countless numbers of crimes upon crimes, from not providing adequate working conditions to racism in the workplace to lynching and countless other immoral and unethical crimes.

Edmunds, Williamson actually knew a guy in high school called Jesse Crowder. Crowder was a tough no-nonsense guy that nobody messed with. After the name was used in Williamson's films, Crowder took legal action against Williamson. The case went to court and Williamson's lawyer placed some phone books on the table and asked him which Crowder he was. Crowder realized he didn't have anywhere to go with this. In the end Williamson decided to cease using the Crowder character.The Hammer: an American Hero, By Harold D.

Primarily founded by David Starkman and Sherman H. Dudley in 1926, the film company for the most part made silent melodramatic films that featured all African American casts. During its brief time operating, the production company released four films, including A Prince of His Race (1926), a remake of Timothy Shay Arthur‚Äôs Ten Nights in a Bar Room (1926) with an all black cast, Children of Fate (1927), and finally The Scar of Shame (1929). Of the four films the company produced only Ten Nights in a Bar Room and The Scar of Shame still remain. Shingzie Howard was one of its stars.  Founders  Sherman H. ‚ÄúUncle Dud‚Äù Dudley was born in Dallas, Texas around 1872. Growing up Dudley was part of medicine and minstrel shows and by the 1890s had become a popular performer. He became interested and learned about films while working on the set of The Simp. Dudley, at the time, a veteran of vaudevillian and race movies had the idea for a black Hollywood free from black stereotypes.Smith, Valerie. Representing Blackness: Issues in Film and Video. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 1997. 54-55. Print. In 1926 Dudley met with David Starkman, an owner of a black theatre; Starkman shared Dudley's vision as well as hoped to aim his films to the African American population in Philadelphia. Thus Dudley and Starkman organized the Colored Players Film Corporation placing Dudley as the President of the Corporation and Starkman in charge of the operation, management, and finances of the film production company.  The Corporation  With the exception of Dudley and the cast of the films, the Colored Players Film Corporation was predominately funded and operated by white entrepreneurs. Although structured in such a way to give the illusion that the white staff was pulling the strings, both black and white staff members of the Corporation worked together during a time in which bigotry and segregation was at its highest in America. The Corporation in that sense would be described as the embodiment of interracial cooperation working together towards a common goal. The goal of course for the Color Players Film Corporation was to produce films that uplifted the African American spirit by combating the humiliating, stereotypical, minstrel portrayals of African Americans in the films of the time period.Wintz, Cary D., and Paul Finkelman. \\"Colored Players Film Corporation.\\" Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance. New York: Routledge, 2004. 236-37. Print. However, one challenge that the Corporation had to meet was bringing in an audience because they were in competition with other independent film production companies. One solution that the Corporation was able to come up with was having expensive sets and hiring a cast that had refined their acting skills which appealed to the urban eastern audiences of the greater Philadelphia area.Palmer, Colin A. \\"Film in the United States.\\" Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History: the Black Experience in the Americas. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2006. Print. C-F Unfortunately for the Corporation this solution would end up doing more harm than good in the long term as it burdened the already ailing production company.  The Scar of Shame  The last film to be produced by the Colored Players Film Corporation, it was also the film production company's most critically acclaimed film that came from the Corporation. Written by David Starkman, and directed by Frank Peregini the film focuses on the social stratification among African Americans living in the same neighborhood. In the film Alvin Hilliard played by Harry Henderson, falls in love with Louise a woman from the lower caste of society. Due to this fact, Alvin is reluctant to tell his mother of his marriage to Louise and chooses to hide this information from his mother. Throughout the remaining of the film there is an internal as well as external turmoil on the part of Alvin of whether he should be with Louise despite her status as person from the ‚Äúblack underworld‚Äù (Cripps 197). The film gained notoriety because it represented a clash of two distinct social castes among the same racial group. The emphasis put on Alvin's decision to stay or leave Louise based on her social standing leaves viewers thinking about what is the Scar of Shame. The darker skin color? Being born into a lower level of society? Whatever the case The Scar of Shame became immensely popular among African American audiences at a time when the multiple levels of society could be seen without much trouble.  Common Themes  A few common themes found throughout the Colored Players Film Corporation film's is the internal conflict that the protagonist must face in order to become enlightened about an external conflict that has been plaguing them. This theme is seen in Ten Nights in a Bar Room as the protagonist chases his daughter's killer during which he discovers himself which guides him to leading a better life. This theme is also prevalent in The Scar of Shame as discussed above Alvin struggles with himself and what society expects of him. Another common theme found in the film company's productions is love. It is seen in A Prince of His Race through motherly love and more obviously in The Scar of Shame with the relationship of Alvin and Louise seen as wrong due to Louise's social status.Cripps, Thomas. \\"Black Underground.\\" Slow Fade to Black: the Negro in American Film, 1900-1942. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1993. 195-99. Print.  The Fall of the Corporation  Several factors played a role in the fall of the Colored Players Film Corporation but most prominently were the misuse of the little funds the Corporation was able to obtain. When the Corporation was first founded it had an initial investment of $100,000, but due to competition with other well known film production companies, such as Oscar Micheaux‚Äôs Lincoln Motion Picture Company, it needed to attract audiences quickly so the Corporation opted to use funds to hire better actors and create improved sets for the films. While this did bring in an audience it didn‚Äôt bring in the revenue it had hoped and coupled with the introduction of sound being incorporated into films, the Corporation was unable to stay financially stable and would soon be absorbed by a larger film production company after the debut of The Scar of Shame. While the Colored Players Film Corporation did not have a long life span, it provided the opportunity for black actors/actresses an opportunity to perfect their acting abilities as well as provided entertainment to the African American population without the employment of stereotypes or minstrel humor.

He wrote and produced the film company's most famous film The Scar of Shame.  Colored Players Film Corporation  In 1926, Starkman helped to found the Colored Players Film Corporation with Sherman H. \\"Uncle Dud\\" Dudley, a veteran of vaudevillian and race movies. Dudley and Starkman shared a common vision in which there was a black Hollywood free of the traditional black stereotypes. With Starkman's theatre in Philadelphia as a base of operations, Colored Players Film Corporation developed with Dudley as the president of the company and Starkman in charge of the management, finances and operation of the production company. The Colored Players Film Corporation took the morals and ethics of Starkman and Dudley seriously and their films attempt to show the African Americans as successful, able to achieve middle class status, and apart from the typical stereotypes and minstrel films of the time. While only Dudley and the cast comprised the African Americans of the Colored Players Film Corporation, the collaboration between both the white and black staff was an integral part of the company. The interracial co-operation found in the company allowed for the success of the film The Scar of Shame.Wood, Brett. \\"Turner Classic Movie Monthly Schedule and Featured Movie Stars from Our Classic Movie Program\\", TCM Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved 12 February 2011.  The Scar of Shame  The peak of the company's success came when it produced the film The Scar of Shame in 1929, a year before the company closed. Starkman produced the film and wrote it with the co-operation of the black staff in order to understand the social caste among African Americans living within the same neighborhood. The film primarily focuses on two protagonists, each from different levels of society. The main protagonist must choose whether or not to be with a woman from a lower caste of society or to leave her in order to keep with the plan his social status has pre-planned for him.  The White Micheaux?  Sometimes called the \\"Oscar Micheaux\\" of the white independent film producers, Starkman helped to produce and write The Scar of Shame a famous film that the Colored Players Film Corporation produced and released before it was eventually absorbed and merged with another film production company. Starkman eventually went bankrupt due to the competition with other independent film companies and a lack of revenue brought in by the company's productions.Lupack, Barbara Tepa. Literary Adaptations in Black American Cinema: from Micheaux to Morrison. Rochester, NY: University of Rochester, 2002. 164-66. Print.  Downfall  Although Starkman worked for his audience in order to enhance their experience in the theatre, he did not always have the money to fund his films. He eventually sold his theatre and then turned his wife's inheritance into cash. He intimidated local Philadelphia lawyers and merchants for capital.Smith, Valerie. Representing Blackness: Issues in Film and Video. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 1997. 54-55. Print. He ultimately wrote scripts and carried the \\"release prints to out of town play dates and [count] the house in person\\" (Smith 54). During production of his last film, The Scar of Shame, Starkman began to offer his own car for the film, put forward his sister's house as a shooting location and decorated the set with his own furniture. In the end, the financial pressure got the best of Starkman and after releasing The Scar of Shame he could no longer compete because of the arrival of sound film, ruining him and similar independent film companies. In a last effort to save the Colored Players Film Corporation, Starkman merged the company with one of his partner's, Sherman Dudley, but the company never took off.

Early life and education Mogens Koch was born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen. He attended architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and between 1925 and 1932 worked for Carl Petersen, Ivar Bentsen and Kaare Klint, where he was trained in the Danish functional tradition. Architectural career Koch primarily worked with church restorations, for example as an architect for Roskilde Cathedral (1950-1971) and with the design and decoration of the Danish Church in London. His architectural works also include an extension of Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Frederiksberg together with Steen Eiler Rasmussen carried out between 1945 and 1968.Marianne Krogh Jensen: Furniture design As a furniture designer Mogens Koch is known for the Folding Chair (1932), the Wing Chair No. 50 and the Armchair No. 51 in mahogony and leather (1936) and the Book Case (1928). Prior to teaching at the Royal Academy, Koch had the good fortune to be a student of noted architect and Professor Kaare Klint. Klint challenged Koch to draw everlasting designs; not only furniture architect, but also in the designing of monuments, buildings, textiles and silverware. Klint was obviously impressed with Mogens Koch talent as a student, and after Koch graduated he went on to be employed at Carl Petersen, Ivar Bentsen and Kaare Klint architect studio. Koch worked at this studio from 1925 until 1932. It was here where he learned to work with the principles behind the Danish functionalism tradition. The furniture designed by Mogens Koch is some of the most elegant and practical solutions to the demands of comfort, functionality and aesthetics. Koch's designs have been the central feature of the Rud Rasmussen Company since 1932, and many of his furniture designs are still in production today. In 1934 Koch opened his own studio. Like Klint, Koch often used previous generations experience in furniture design and implemented these experiences into his own designs. Some of Koch's best known works include the extension of the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Frederiksberg. This was a joint project with Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Koch's released a highly successful sectional bookcase in 1928. A ‚ÄòFolding Chair‚Äô which was designed in 1933, but was not manufactured until 1959, yet is still being manufactured today. Koch is also known for renovation of churches. Mogens Koch's professional direction changed a little in the 1950s, and he began spending much of his time renovating churches and other buildings. He was involved in converting the former Frederiks Hospital in Copenhagen for use by the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Koch's most famous piece of furniture is the square book case which was designed for his own home in 1928. It has a particularly flexible, space saving designed, and it was adjustable for the book formats of the future. Like Kaare Klint, Mogens Koch spent much time studying mathematics and human proportions as well as studying historical furniture items to help his own designs. Koch's practical and natural furniture is usually made of indestructible maintenance free materials. Mogens Koch is one of the few Danish architects who have completely succeeded in implemented Kaare Klint's teachings of functionalism. Morgens Koch was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1938 and C. F. Hansen Medal in 1963. he was awarded the Cabinet-Makers‚Äô Guild annual prize in 1964 and the Danish Furniture Manufacturers Association's Furniture Award in 1982.

Major themes in his work include the race-related achievement gap in the United States and how to improve schools and identify effective teachers. Education Ferguson earned an undergraduate degree in economics from Cornell University and a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Career Ferguson was appointed to Harvard University in 1983. He is currently a Senior Lecturer in Education and Public Policy with a joint appointment to the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School. Ferguson also serves as a fellow for the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy. He is one of the founders and the current faculty director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University. Ferguson sits on the Board of Directors of The Basics, Inc., a nonprofit aimed to improve the basic foundational skills of early childhood caregiving and development, which stems from works of the Academic Gap Initiative. In 2014, Ferguson co-founded The Tripod Education Partners, Inc. Additionally, he is one of the co-owners of Freshpond Education, Inc. = The Tripod Project = The Tripod Project, founded in 2014, is a student survey system that was developed by Ferguson, with the intent of using student feedback to understand effective teaching strategies. The survey is administered by Cambridge Education, a consulting group that analyzes the results and releases their reports back to schools. From 2009- 2010, the Gates Foundation sponsored the Measures of Effective Teaching Project. In that project, nearly 3,000 K-12 teachers in more than 6 districts administered the survey as a byproduct of the initiative. The survey has also gone international, reaching classrooms in both China and Canada. Specifically, in 2009, the Pittsburg School District distributed the student survey to 250 classrooms as part of a pilot program. In 2011, the program expanded, implementing the survey in nearly 1,300 classrooms. However, in 2012, Bill Hileman, Vice President of the local teachers union, Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, expressed reluctance in immediately factoring the survey results into teacher evaluations. A public debate surrounding the potential role of such survey results surfaced in 2012. The Tripod Education Partners, Inc. ended its collaboration with Cambridge Education in 2014. The survey structure consists of using a 5-point scale where the student agrees or disagrees with the listed statement. Statements include: * Our class stays busy and does not waste time. * I understand what I am supposed to be learning in this class. * If I don't understand something, my teacher explains it another way. * My teacher pushes everyone to work hard. * My teacher takes the time to summarize what we learn each day. Ferguson found a correlation between high survey responses and overall classroom performance calculated at the end of the year. He argues that students of teachers with high ratings perform a complete semester better than students of teachers who received lower ratings in comparison to their counterparts. Furthermore, anonymous responses are said to increase the accuracy of the study. Critics have argued that there is an \\"immediate objection\\" from many teachers who question the value in children evaluating their instructors. Researchers counter this argument by highlighting the fact that teachers spend \\"hundreds more hours\\" with their students than with any other administrator, making them valuable assets in improving classrooms.  Personal Life  Ronald Ferguson has been married for 38 years to his spouse. He is the father of two adult sons. Research Beginning in 1980, Ferguson initially concentrated his research on the issues surrounding economic and community development. Later this resulted in the publication of his social science synthesis volume Urban Problems and Community Development (1999). Gradually, in the latter portion of the decade, Ferguson's research shifted and began to focus on education and youth development. His work has been published by numerous organizations including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Education, the National Research Council, and the Brookings Institution. In December of 2007, Ferguson's book Toward Excellence with Equity: An Emerging Vision for Closing the Achievement Gap was published by Harvard Education Press and released to the public. Ferguson's research for the past decade has focused on education and school improvement, with a focus on racial achievement gaps.

Through his music and activism, Vigalantee has been involved in crusading for human, civil, and labor rights, as well as several outreach programs designed to keep area youths out of prison. Vigalantee owns PhatAhDat Records, an independent label. He has stated in interviews that he took the name \\"Vigalantee\\" from the comic book character, Spider-Man, who attempts to help people but is still constantly under the threat of arrest from the police.  Biography = Early life= Vigalantee was born in Chicago, but spent the majority of his childhood in a small town in Georgia, where he had a daily reminder of racism and segregation. He recalls watching his grandfather \\"walking like a sharecropper,\\" and living close to poverty, dynamics that made him aware of his second-class citizenship status. As he grew older, he realized that his experience was shared by many blacks living in the South, and came to understand that if blacks could have a shared experience of oppression, they could likewise band together with a common agenda and a solid community to empower themselves out of the de facto racism. In interviews, he often references these painful memories and realizations as the backbone of his present-day activism.  Musical career = Style and influence= Vigalantee's' stylistic signature is the use of acronyms in titles of his albums and songs, such as M.I.S.E.R.Y. and A.N.I.M.A.L. Referred to as the Acronym King, Suggs believes acronyms are easier for the intended recipients of his message. \\"People relate to it better and it sticks to the mind easier,\\" Vigalantee has said. It's a God-given gift.\\" Musically and professionally, Vigalantee has been influenced by a wide array of artists, from Curtis Mayfield to Canibus. Vigalantee has publicly expressed his belief that music is the gateway to establishing profound social change, and that these acts create \\"thought provoking music\\" as to a way to educate their listeners while also entertaining them. Lyrically, he cites Chuck D, LL Cool J, and Poor Righteous Teachers as integral influences. Not surprisingly, Vigalantee relies on his albums to make political and social statements. His songs have often contained controversial themes innate to the human experience, such as poverty, racism, prejudice, sexism, religion, murder, justice, religion, civil rights, and politics. In numerous interviews, Vigalantee has expressed his belief in using music as a way to critique social inequalities and establish change. His solo career has largely encouraged his fans to consider their role in being part of that change, asking them to be \\"called\\" to action, rather than driven, to turn activism into action. Much like Jay-Z and 50 Cent, Vigalantee has also branched into entrepreneurial pursuits, most recently in crossing over to the literary world. His first book, an autobiography entitled The Greatest Story That was Never Heard Til Now, is due out in March 2011. A second book, Love, Lust, Defeat, Deceit, a collection of his poetry, is currently seeking a publisher while looking for a spring release date. = Social and political views= Vigalantee considers himself to be a social activist, a role that has distinguished his music from that of his peers. While he's commented on a number of issues pertaining to social injustice, Vigalantee felt a particular stirring in regards to the unsolved murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till. The black Till was lynched during a visit to Mississippi relatives for allegedly whistling at a white woman, and his brutal death is credited with starting the Civil Rights Movement that would define the 1950s and 60's. Shortly before Congress enacted the Emmett Till Civil Rights Bill, Vigalantee recorded an eponymous single sharing the teen's story, feeling a connection to Till's journey from Chicago into the deep South. Vigalantee notes that, while popular artists have all name-dropped Emmett Till in their songs, \\"the true story of Emmett Till has never really been told,\\" ultimately concluding, \\"young people don't know nothing about Emmett Till.\\" Vigalantee has also worked to equalize treatment between the sexes, openly disagreeing with how women are treated in modern forms of entertainment and the media. In response to criticisms that there is a decisive lack of respectful depictions of women in popular hip-hop and rap, Vigalantee sought to deconstruct the traditional treatment of women with his album, \\"A Second is a Lifetime.\\" One single in particular, \\"Beautiful Black Woman,\\" encourages listeners to adopt a more compassionate approach to the treatment of women around the globe. = No Jaangle and F.B.O.E.= Though music has been a constant companion in Vigalantee's life, Vigalantee has been performing professionally since 1993. Since 1994, Vigalantee has owned and operated PhatAhDat Records. His independent label has allowed to focus on delivering his agenda with his music, rather than be censored to reflect social trends. With the resources of PhatAhDat, Vigalantee also pioneered the No Jaangle Movement, a social consciousness movement that challenges young people to combat the stigma of \\"bojangling,\\" a negative stereotype that haunts most minority youths. With the No Jaangle Movement, Vigalantee hopes to motivate folks to realize ignorance isn't a component of success. Vigalantee formed an alliance with a collection of gifted teachers, students, and talented volunteers to help young people establish financial stability, network with community contacts, and gain a sense of purpose. \\"It means never compromising who you are, and realizing that you don't have to be ignorant to be successful. It also means respecting and recognizing those who've walked before you, taking the black face of shame off, combating \\"Bojangling\\". Vigalantee is also the co-founder of the Fringe Benefits Of Education (F.B.O.E.), a program geared towards empowering young people around the Kansas City in achieving their dreams[5]. Recognizing a noticeable gap in resources available for young men in the 17 to 22 age demographic, Fringe Benefits of Education networks to provide scholarship opportunities and support groups. To date, the program has also been endowed with a $10,000 grant from Kansas City Kansas Community College.

So has its banking sector. During this period, recognising the evolving needs of the sector, the Finance Ministry of Government of India (GOI) set up various committees with the task of analysing India's banking sector and recommending legislation and regulations to make it more effective, competitive and efficient. Two such expert Committees were set up under the chairmanship of M. Narasimham. They submitted their recommendations in the 1990s in reports widely known as the Narasimham Committee-I (1991) report and the Narasimham Committee-II (1998) Report. These recommendations not only helped unleash the potential of banking in India, they are also recognised as a factor towards minimising the impact of global financial crisis starting in 2007. Unlike the socialist-democratic era of the 1960s to 1980s, India is no longer insulated from the global economy and yet its banks survived the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed, a feat due in part to these Narasimham Committees. Background During the decades of the 60s and the 70s, India nationalised most of its banks. This culminated with the balance of payments crisis of the Indian economy where India had to airlift gold to International Monetary Fund (IMF) to loan money to meet its financial obligations. This event called into question the previous banking policies of India and triggered the era of economic liberalisation in India in 1991. Given that rigidities and weaknesses had made serious inroads into the Indian banking system by the late 1980s, the Government of India (GOI), post-crisis, took several steps to remodel the country's financial system. (Some claim that these reforms were influenced by the IMF and the World Bank as part of their loan conditionality to India in 1991). The banking sector, handling 80% of the flow of money in the economy, needed serious reforms to make it internationally reputable, accelerate the pace of reforms and develop it into a constructive usher of an efficient, vibrant and competitive economy by adequately supporting the country's financial needs. In the light of these requirements, two expert Committees were set up in 1990s under the chairmanship of M. Narasimham (an ex-RBI (Reserve Bank of India) governor) which are widely credited for spearheading the financial sector reform in India. The first Narasimhan Committee (Committee on the Financial System ‚Äì CFS) was appointed by Manmohan Singh as India's Finance Minister on 14 August 1991, and the second one (Committee on Banking Sector Reforms) was appointed by P.Chidambaram as Finance Minister in December 1997. Subsequently, the first one widely came to be known as the Narasimham Committee-I (1991) and the second one as Narasimham-II Committee(1998). This article is about the recommendations of the Second Narasimham Committee, the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms. The purpose of the Narasimham-I Committee was to study all aspects relating to the structure, organisation, functions and procedures of the financial systems and to recommend improvements in their efficiency and productivity. The Committee submitted its report to the Finance Minister in November 1991 which was tabled in Parliament on 17 December 1991. The Narasimham-II Committee was tasked with the progress review of the implementation of the banking reforms since 1992 with the aim of further strengthening the financial institutions of India. It focussed on issues like size of banks and capital adequacy ratio among other things. M. Narasimham, Chairman, submitted the report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Committee-II) to the Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in April 1998. Recommendations of the Committee The 1998 report of the Committee to the GOI made the following major recommendations: = Autonomy in Banking = Greater autonomy was proposed for the public sector banks in order for them to function with equivalent professionalism as their international counterparts.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/24157.pdf For this the panel recommended that recruitment procedures, training and remuneration policies of public sector banks be brought in line with the best- market-practices of professional banking systemname=\\"Hindu3\\"> It also recommended the RBI relinquish its seats on the board of directors of these banks. The committee further added that given that the government nominees to the board of banks are often members of parliament, politicians, bureaucrats, etc., they often interfere in the day-to-day operations of the bank in the form of the behest-lending. As such the committee recommended a review of functions of banks boards with a view to make them responsible for enhancing shareholder value through formulation of corporate strategy and reduction of the government equity.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/24157.pdf To implement this, criteria for autonomous status was identified by March 1999 (among other implementation measures) and 17 banks were considered eligible for autonomy. But some recommendations like reduction in Government's equity to 33%, the issue of greater professionalism and independence of the board of directors of public sector banks is still awaiting Government follow-through and implementation. = Reform in the role of RBI = First, the committee recommended that the RBI withdraw from the 91-day treasury bills market and that interbank call money and term money markets be restricted to banks and primary dealers. Second, the Committee proposed a segregation of the roles of RBI as a regulator of banks and owner of bank. It observed that \\"The Reserve Bank as a regulator of the monetary system should not be the owner of a bank in view of a possible conflict of interest\\". As such, it highlighted that RBI's role of effective supervision was not adequate and wanted it to divest its holdings in banks and financial institutions. Pursuant to the recommendations, the RBI introduced a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) operated through repo and reverse repos to set a corridor for money market interest rates. To begin with, in April 1999, an Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF) was introduced pending further upgradation in technology and legal/procedural changes to facilitate electronic transfer. As for the second recommendation, the RBI decided to transfer its respective shareholdings of public banks like State Bank of India (SBI), National Housing Bank (NHB) and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to GOI. Subsequently, in 2007‚Äì08, GOI decided to acquire entire stake of RBI in SBI, NHB and NABARD. Of these, the terms of sale for SBI were finalised in 2007‚Äì08 itself. = Stronger banking system = The Committee recommended for merger of large Indian banks to make them strong enough for supporting international trade.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/24157.pdfIt recommended a three tier banking structure in India through establishment of three large banks with international presence, eight to ten national banks and a large number of regional and local banks. This proposal had been severely criticized by the RBI employees union. The Committee recommended the use of mergers to build the size and strength of operations for each bank. However, it cautioned that large banks should merge only with banks of equivalent size and not with weaker banks, which should be closed down if unable to revitalise themselves. Given the large percentage of non-performing assets for weaker banks, some as high as 20% of their total assets, the concept of \\"narrow banking\\" was proposed to assist in their rehabilitation.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/24157.pdf There were a string of mergers in banks of India during the late 90s and early 2000s, encouraged strongly by the Government of IndiaGOI in line with the Committee's recommendations. However, the recommended degree of consolidation is still awaiting sufficient government impetus. = Non-performing assets = Non-performing assets had been the single largest cause of irritation of the banking sector of India. Earlier the Narasimham Committee-I had broadly concluded that the main reason for the reduced profitability of the commercial banks in India was the priority sector lending. The committee had highlighted that 'priority sector lending' was leading to the buildup of non-performing assets of the banks and thus it recommended it to be phased out. Subsequently, the Narasimham Committee-II also highlighted the need for 'zero' non- performing assets for all Indian banks with International presence. The 1998 report further blamed poor credit decisions, behest-lending and cyclical economic factors among other reasons for the buildup of the non-performing assets of these banks to uncomfortably high levels. The Committee recommended creation of Asset Reconstruction Funds or Asset Reconstruction Companies to take over the bad debts of banks, allowing them to start on a clean-slate. The option of recapitalisation through budgetary provisions was ruled out. Overall the committee wanted a proper system to identify and classify NPAs, NPAs to be brought down to 3% by 2002 and for an independent loan review mechanism for improved management of loan portfolios. The committee's recommendations led to introduction of a new legislation which was subsequently implemented as the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and came into force with effect from 21 June 2002. = Capital adequacy and tightening of provisioning norms = To improve the inherent strength of the Indian banking system the committee recommended that the Government should raise the prescribed capital adequacy norms. This would also improve their risk taking ability.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/24157.pdf The committee targeted raising the capital adequacy ratio to 9% by 2000 and 10% by 2002 and have penal provisions for banks that fail to meet these requirements. For asset classification, the Committee recommended a mandatory 1% in case of standard assets and for the accrual of interest income to be done every 90 days instead of 180 days. To implement these recommendations, the RBI in Oct 1998, initiated the second phase of financial sector reforms by raising the banks' capital adequacy ratio by 1% and tightening the prudential norms for provisioning and asset classification in a phased manner on the lines of the Narasimham Committee-II report. The RBI targeted to bring the capital adequacy ratio to 9% by March 2001. The mid-term Review of the Monetary and Credit Policy of RBI announced another series of reforms, in line with the recommendations with the Committee, in October 1999. = Entry of foreign banks = The committee suggested that the foreign banks seeking to set up business in India should have a minimum start-up capital of $25 million as against the existing requirement of $10 million. It said that foreign banks can be allowed to set up subsidiaries and joint ventures that should be treated on a par with private banks. Implementation of recommendations In 1998, RBI Governor Bimal Jalan informed the banks that the RBI had a three to four-year perspective on the implementation of the Committee's recommendations. Based on the other recommendations of the committee, the concept of a universal bank was discussed by the RBI and finally ICICI bank became the first universal bank of India. The RBI published an \\"Actions Taken on the Recommendations\\" report on 31 October 2001 on its own website. Most of the recommendations of the Committee have been acted upon (as discussed above) although some major recommendations are still awaiting action from the Government of India. Criticism There were protests by employee unions of banks in India against the report. The Union of RBI employees made a strong protest against the Narasimham II Report. There were other plans by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), representing about 1.3 million bank employees in India, to meet in Delhi and to work out a plan of action in the wake of the Narasimham Committee report on banking reforms. The committee was also criticised in some quarters as \\"anti-poor\\". According to some, the committees failed to recommend measures for faster alleviation of poverty in India by generating new employment. This caused some suffering to small borrowers (both individuals and businesses in tiny, micro and small sectors). Reception Initially, the recommendations were well received in all quarters, including the Planning Commission of India leading to successful implementation of most of its recommendations. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, performance of the Indian banking sector was far better than its international counterparts. This was also credited to the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee-II with particular reference to the capital adequacy norms and the recapitalisation of the public sector banks. The impact of the two committees has been so significant that elite politicians and financial sectors professionals have been discussing these reports for more than a decade since their first submission applauding their positive contribution References Government agencies of India Banking in India 1998 in India Economic history of India (1947‚Äìpresent) History of banking Financial history of India ","title":"Narasimham Committee"},{"id":"30885612","text":"Jean Danican (D'Anican) Philidor (c. 1620 ‚Äì September 8, 1679) was a court musician at Versailles during the reign of Louis XIII, and a member of the prestigious Philidor family.Thompson, Wendy. \\"Philidor\\" in The New Oxford Companion to Music.

It lies north from Stamford and south-west from Bourne. It is a collection of houses around a country house and park. The park includes a small private church dedicated to St Wilfrid. Ornamental lakes have been restored over the last 20 years, and new gardens laid out. In 2009 the gardens were open to the public through the National Garden Scheme. Two venerated springs are reported in the village, Holy Well and St Winifred's. Only the location of the first is known. There are no other place names associated with venerated springs in Lincolnshire, although other Holy Wells exist such as those near the site of Sempringham Priory and nearby Ryhall. History St Wilfrid's church, Holywell Hall The 1885 Kelly's Directory notes that Holywell with Aunby consists of with chief agricultural of barley and wheat, and an 1881 population of 63, and that ‚Äúa medicinal spring rises here from where the place takes its name‚Äù. Holywell Hall, a mansion in ‚Äúwell-wooded park‚Äù, was then the seat of Charles Thomas Samuel Birch-Reynardson DL, lord of the manor, and sole landowner. The chapel in the park, a small stone building in Early English style, was reconstructed in reign of Queen Anne. It comprises a chancel, nave, south aisle and two-bell tower. A restoration of 1863-64 included the replacement of a previous flat roof with one of open timber, with the church interior re-fitted in oak, ‚Äúeffected under the superintendence of rector Rev J B Reynardson‚Äù.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 483 In 1916 Cox stated that Holywell is a chapelry of Careby parish. The church in Holywell Hall grounds was moved in 1699 from a site east of the Castle Bytham road 'between the bridge and the mill' where it had been subject to frequent flooding. It incorporates material from the destroyed church of Aunby, including two Norman piers that support the tower, a Decorated doorway and a window glazed with Perpendicular style glass.Cox, J.

St Wilfrid‚Äôs is Grade II* listed. Holywell Hall Holywell Hall is a Grade II* listed 17th-century country house, built on the site of an older medieval manor house.\\"Holywell Hall\\" British Listed Buildings It was built in three phases. Beginning as an L-shaped house, it was extended in either 1732 or 1764, and again in the early 19th century. The west front of the house is possibly from 1764, and the south and east fronts from the 19th century. In 1728, it was bought from the Goodhall family by Lady Mary Barnadiston, n√©e Reynardson, for her nephew Samuel Reynardson. Reynardson may have laid out the gardens, and built the temples in Palladian style in 1732, the time of his marriage. South-west of the house, against a lake, is a Grade II* listed fishing temple with pedimented Roman Doric portico and rusticated windows. It is identical to the menagerie designed by James Gibbs at Hackwood and published in his 1728 \\"Book of Architecture\\". Facing the hall‚Äôs drive are listed Palladian stables with an octagonal domed lantern. Further listed buildings are a 17th-century dovecote, an orangery to the west of the hall, and a three-arched balustraded bridge on the road between two easterly lakes. In 1954 the Hon. Mrs Mountjoy Fane (Agatha Isabel Acland-Hood-Reynardson) sold the Hall with 69 acres to Philip Lockwood who owned Lockwood Foods Ltd. Mrs Fane retained ownership of several hundred acres of farm land. In 1977 Philip Lockwood emigrated to France and the Hall was then occupied by his son, William Lockwood. In 1984 the Hall was sold to Keith Childs who had a shoe import business, Holywell Footwear Ltd, based at the Hall. In 1994 the Hall and 830 acre estate was sold to Princess Yuri Galitzine (Dr. Jean Shanks) for ¬£4m. In 2003 it was sold to Robert Gillespie for ¬£7m. In October 2013 the Hall with approx. 76 acres was sold for ¬£4.7m to a company based in the British Virgin Islands, Slipstream Overseas SA. The farmland of 863 acres was sold separately for approx. ¬£6.25m.

Although it is located within Montgomery County, Maryland, the only road access is via a bridge connecting it to the Loudoun County, Virginia side of the river. Archaeological evidence indicates the island has been a site of human activity since the Early Woodland period, around 1000 BCE. A characteristic type of pottery known as Selden Island ware dates from this period. It is also the site of a significant Late Woodland period settlement known as the Walker Prehistoric Village, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. In 2002, following the diagnosis of two Loudoun County teenagers with malaria, mosquitoes from the island were found to carry the Plasmodium vivax malarial parasite. In 2004, Selden Island was purchased by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as an addition to the Janelia Farm Research Campus. It was formerly leased as a sod farm.

Melford and Valentino has previously worked together on the box office hit The Sheik, in 1921. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Frank Norris and was adapted for the screen by Monte Katterjohn.Moran of the Lady Letty at silentera.com Plot The opening scenes are set in Scandinavia, where a ship's captain and his daughter, Moran, are introduced. Moran, it is clear, adores her father. She has grown up on and around ships and can handle herself on the water as well as any man. Then scene then shifts to San Francisco, where a young socialite, Ramon Laredo, complains that he is tired of the same tiresome round of parties and dances. He wishes he could get away from it all. While on his way to a yachting party, he meets up with an old sailor. After talking, they repair to a saloon, where Ramon is served a Mickey Finn. After passing out, he is shanghaied aboard a nefarious pirating ship, the \\"Heart of China,\\" run by Captain Kitchell, a man without principles. Though initially dismissed as a pampered weakling by the crew and captain, Ramon proves his manhood and gradually gains everyone's respect. A Scandinavian ship in distress is spotted off the bow; the pirate crew quickly move in to loot the burning ship. Most of the crew, they discover, is dead, victims of leaking coal gas. Ramon rescues one sailor, whom he carries back to the pirate ship, only to discover that \\"he\\" is a \\"she.\\" It is Moran, of course, whose father has perished aboard the burning ship. Efforts to hide her identify are futile; when Captain Kitchell discovers a female is on board, it is clear that the woman's virginity is endangered. Ramon, however, is determined to protect her. Gradually, Ramon and Moran fall in love, though Moran insists at first that she has no interest in romance‚Äîshe should have been born a boy, she says. After a lively battle on board the ship‚Äîcrew vs. captain and his henchmen‚Äîthe ship reaches the port in San Diego. Disembarking, Ramon finds himself at a high-society party attended by vacationing San Franciscans. They are delighted to see him and urge him to rejoin their company. But Ramon makes it clear that his experience of recent months has changed him, has made him a better man. Confidently, happily, he returns to the ship and to Moran's waiting arms. Production, characters Rudolph Valentino, Walter Long and Dorothy Dalton in a scene from the film. On the heels of The Four Horsemen and The Sheik, Moran was another vehicle to portray a strong, masculine character, here a San Francisco playboy who is transformed into a \\"masculine, sun-burned sailor\\". In the climax of the movie, Valentino fights the villain (played by Walter Long, whom Valentino had earlier dealt with in The Sheik) in the ship's rigging. Though the female love interest, Moran, tells him initially that she is \\"not made for men\\", they do kiss in a happy ending. As did Laredo, so does Moran's character change‚Äîfrom an independent, sexually ambiguous person to a \\"more feminine, definitely heterosexual woman at peace with her estrogen\\". The choice of Dorothy Dalton was criticized in a review in Variety. The film was described in April 1922's edition of Photoplay as \\"More or less pure hoakum that you‚Äôre almost ashamed of yourself for enjoying. Whether it is the presence of two sparklers such as Valentino and Dorothy Dalton, or whether it is the original power of the Frank Norris novel, we don‚Äôt know; but it‚Äôs good strong entertainment.

It opened in 1994.Jane Perlez, China Maintains Respect, and a Museum, for a U.S. General, The New York Times, February 23, 2016, accessed February 24, 2016. Background During World War II General Joseph Stilwell, known to his men as \\"Vinegar Joe\\", was the Allied Chief of Staff in the China Theater of Operations. He arrived in Chongqing on March 4, 1942. Stilwell was in charge of the United States' Lend-Lease policy with Chinese forces and had an acrimonious relationship with Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who he derisively called \\"Peanut.\\" His low regard for Chiang, and positive words towards the Communist forces, contributed to his high standing in the People's Republic of China. Description Located in Stilwell's former residence and headquarters, the museum comprises a three-storied house furnished in 1940s style. In the courtyard there is an engraving of a speech by American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The building opened as a museum in 1994 and is run by the Chongqing Municipal Government.

She was one of the leading prima donnas at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket (it later became the \\"King's Theatre\\" after King George I's accession in 1714) from 1710 to 1717. She is best remembered today for creating roles in at least four operas by George Frideric Handel, possibly five. Three of the roles that Handel wrote specifically for her were sorceresses, and the demands of those roles indicate that she possessed an exceptional voice capable of both dramatic power and technical agility.Dean, page 382 She is said to have had a bitter rivalry with the Queen's other leading soprano, Isabella Girardeau.Dean, page 192 Life and career Pilotti-Schiavonetti was born in Italy sometime during the last quarter of the 17th century. She was married to the Venetian oboist, cellist, and harpsichordist Giovanni Schiavonetti.Timms, page 126 Prior to their careers in England, the couple worked as musicians in the court of Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. It was there that the couple first made the acquaintance of Handel during the composer's early career in Germany.Kobb√©, 300 The couple came to London in 1710 when Giovanni took a position as a court musician for Sophia's brother, George II of Great Britain.Daub, page 76 Soon after arriving in England, Pilotti-Schiavonetti was offered a position at the Queen's Theatre. She made her debut with the company in November 1710 in Francesco Mancini's Idaspe fedele. On 24 February 1711 she sang the role of Armida in the momentous premiere of Handel's first opera for the London stage, Rinaldo. The work was notably the first Italian language opera written specifically for the English theatre. A tremendous success with the public, a further 12 performances were immediately scheduled after its premiere; at the end of the run, popular demand was such that two more were added.Dean and Knapp, pp. 182‚Äì83 The opera was played at the theatre in most seasons until 1716‚Äì17, and Pilotti-Schiavonetti was the only singer from the original cast that appeared in all 47 performances of the opera up to that point.Dean and Knapp, p. 156 Evidently Pilotti-Schiavonetti's voice and skill as an actress impressed Handel, as the composer went on to compose at least three more roles for the soprano. She created parts in the world premieres of Handel's Il pastor fido (1712, Amarilli), Teseo (1713, Medea), and Amadigi di Gaula (1715, Melissa). It is likely that she also created the part of Metella in Handel's Silla (1713), but this fact cannot be definitely proven. She was also seen at the Queen's Theatre in Francesco Gasparini's Antioco and Ambleto; Giovanni Bononcini's Etearco; and in numerous pasticcios.Dean, page 382 A letter from 1716 described Pilotti-Schiavonetti as a servant of Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales. She and her husband returned to Germany a few years later. They were committed to the court at Stuttgart in 1726 where Elisabetta sang in several comic operas, including Pyramus and Thisbe under the direction of her husband. They then returned to Hanover where Giovanni died in 1730, followed by Elisabetta in 1742.

Applications Social CRM has applications in marketing, customer service and sales, including: * Social Engagement with prospects: SocialCRM tools allow businesses to better engage with their customers by, for example, listening to sentiments about their products and services. *Social Customer Service: Ownership of social media is shifting away from Marketing and Communication as engagement increasingly relates to inbound customer service- based topics. Rather than social being seen purely as a space for companies to deliver outbound marketing messages, it is the inbound customer queries that allow for meaningful points of engagement and the building of brand advocacy. *Personalized Marketing Strategy: The ability to create custom content is increasingly dependent on access to reliable, qualitative social user data to facilitate precise audience segmentation. Furthermore, dynamic audience segments, built on both social data and demographic data, allow for more accurate measurement of campaign KPIs. Traditional CRM Traditional customer relationship management focuses on collecting and managing static customer data, such as past purchase information, contact history and customer demographics. This information is often sourced from email and phone interactions, commonly limited to direct interactions between the company and the customer. Social CRM adds a deeper layer of information onto traditional CRM by adding data derived from social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other social network where a user publicly shares information. The key benefit of social CRM is the ability for companies to interact with customers in a multichannel retailing environment (commonly referred to as omnichannel) and talk to customers the way they talk to each other. Social CRM enables companies to track a customer's social influence and source data from conversations occurring outside of formal, direct communication. Social CRM also allows companies to keep a full audit history of all customer interactions, regardless of social channel they choose to use, available to all customer care employees.

The screenplay is by Reza and Polanski. The film is an international co- production of France, Germany, Poland, and Spain. It stars Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz, and John C. Reilly. In the film, presented in a classic case of much ado about nothing, two sets of parents try to resolve a situation in a civilised manner. But, the actual matter aside, it is their own idiosyncrasies that rise to the surface. Carnage premiered at the 2011 Venice International Film Festival on 1 September 2011, where it competed for the Golden Lion. It was theatrically released on 18 November 2011. The film received positive reviews with critics drawing major acclaim towards the performances of Foster and Winslet and Polanski's direction. At the 69th Golden Globe Awards, Foster and Winslet received nominations for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It is currently Polanski's last film to be shot in English. Plot When two grade-school boys get into a fight in the park that results in one boy, Zachary Cowan, hitting the other, Ethan Longstreet, in the face with a stick, their parents meet in a Brooklyn apartment to discuss the matter. Zachary's parents, Alan (Christoph Waltz) and Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet), visit the home of Michael (John C. Reilly) and Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out. In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion. At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting amongst themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \\"superficially fair-minded\\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration. Nancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he, annoyed by the constant noise it made during the night, had earlier turned his daughter Courtney's pet hamster loose in the street. Penelope becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Other issues include a risky drug Alan is working to defend and Michael's mother has been prescribed, and the question of idealism and responsibility that is part of Penelope's current work. Michael offers everyone a glass of fine scotch. Penelope claims she doesn't \\"get drunk\\" and Nancy drinks way too many and finally stops Alan's phone calls by dropping his cellphone in Penelope's flower vase full of tulips and water. Penelope and Nancy both laugh uproariously while Michael and Alan try to blow-dry the BlackBerry. The conversation continues to decay into personal attacks and opinionated statements and, eventually, epithets are uttered. Penelope is ranting, calling Nancy's son a 'snitch', and Nancy's true colors are revealed when she destroys the tulips and drunkenly and vulgarly states she is glad that her son beat up Penelope's and Michael's son. The couples realize the conversation is going nowhere. Alan's BlackBerry, lying on the coffee table, vibrates, and all four stare at it. The film cuts to the hamster, alive and well in the park, where Ethan and Zachary are reconciling on their own. Cast Jodie Foster as Penelope Longstreet * John C. Reilly as Michael Longstreet * Kate Winslet as Nancy Cowan * Christoph Waltz as Alan Cowan * Elvis Polanski as Zachary Cowan * Eliot Berger as Ethan Longstreet * Roman Polanski as a neighbor (uncredited cameo) Production Although set in Brooklyn, New York, the film was shot in Paris, because of Polanski's fugitive status. The opening and closing scenes, ostensibly filmed in Brooklyn Bridge Park, were shot in France against a green screen. Polanski's son Elvis, seen only in long shots in the opening and closing scenes, portrays the Cowans' son. Actress Julie Adams (famous for Creature from the Black Lagoon) voices Alan Cowan's secretary on the phone, and was a dialect coach for Waltz.End credits. The apartment, in which almost the whole film takes place, was designed in a sound studio on the outskirts of Paris. Production designer Dean Tavoularis placed a priority on making the set look authentically American, having numerous products and appliances shipped from the US, and renting American ironmongery for the doors. Release The film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. The film was released in the United States on 16 December 2011 by Sony Pictures Classics. Reception =Critical response= Carnage received generally positive reviews from critics. It holds a 71% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which notes that \\"it isn't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage, but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster.\\"\\"Carnage\\". Rotten Tomatoes. Flixter. Retrieved 16 December 2011. On Metacritic, which uses an average of the critics' reviews, the film holds a 61/100, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\".\\"Carnage Reviews, Ratings, Credits\\". Metacritic. CBS Interactive. Retrieved 16 December 2011. John Anderson of Newsday compared the film to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and said: \\"The astonishing Waltz steals the picture, possibly because he's the one with a rational perspective (despite his telephonic obsessiveness). He sees the whole exercise as pointless. Ultimately, so do we.\\" Giuseppe Sedia of the Krakow Post remarked that the descent of four adults to a thuggish level has been featured as well in Polanski's short film Rozbijemy zabawƒô. He added that \\"it is interesting to speculate on what Hitchcock might have made of Reza's oeuvre\\". =Box office= Carnage grossed $2.5 million at the U.S. box office after twenty weeks in theaters, with another $25 million in foreign countries, for a worldwide gross of $27,603,069.

Its main ingredient is nicotine and it is present in all cigarettes. Early tobacco usage was for medical cures and religious purposes. In the 1990s, cigarette usage became increasingly popular when it was sold in mass amounts. The popularity of smoking increased and in 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States wrote a report concerning the dangers of cigarette smoking. In the United States, for the past 50 years efforts have been made so that the public should be aware of the risks of tobacco usage. In Alabama, 22.1% of the adult population (ages 18+), over 783,000 individuals, are current cigarette smokers. Across all states, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults ranges from 9.3% to 26.5%. Alabama ranks 42nd among the states. Among youth ages 12‚Äì17, 12.0% smoke in Alabama. The range across all states is 6.5% to 15.9%. Alabama ranks 40th among the states. Among adults age 35+ years, over 7,600 died as a result of tobacco use per year, on average, during 2000‚Äì2004. This represents a smoking- attributable mortality rate of 317.5 per 100,000. Alabama's smoking- attributable mortality rate ranks 44th among the states. Also, approximately 850 adult non-smokers die each year from exposure to secondhand smoke.  Anti-tobacco actions  =Nonprofit groups= The American Lung Association, an organization which campaigns against the use of tobacco, is a member of the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Alabama and works towards reducing the tobacco usage in the state. They try to discourage tobacco usage by working to create smoke-free environments and advocating an increase of tobacco taxes. = State legislative efforts = While Alabama does not have a statewide smoking ban, smoking is prohibited in many public places and meetings because of the Alabama Clean Indoor Act which was enacted in 2003. State local governments have their own bans against smoking in their counties. A bill for a statewide smoking ban failed in the Alabama Legislature in May 2008. Alabama attempted to pass a smoking ban again in 2009, that was stalled when its author, Vivian Figures, pulled the bill from Senate consideration after it was amended by Senate to include smoking exemptions in certain places. In March 2011, a new bill was proposed, that if passed would ban smoking in all public places. = Youth initiatives = In 2008, a student group called Students Working Against Tobacco (SWAT) received $28,000 from the Alabama Department of Public Health to spread their message. SWAT operates out of Bryant, LeFlore and Murphy high schools and Phillips Preparatory middle school. The Youth Empowerment Program is a peer-teaching model that provides anti-tobacco messages to more than 58,000 teens according to Alabama's state health officer Don Williamson. The state funds community groups to educate people about the dangers of second- hand smoke and to encourage young people to reject tobacco use. The State Health Department also has a new teen cessation project that uses advertising on television and radio, as well as a MySpace page. The Auburn CARES Coalition and the Alabama Department of Public Health encourage young people to make healthy tobacco-free choices and for those using chewing tobacco to quit. ADPH offers a free support and counseling service to help users successfully quit.  Economic impact  The State of Tobacco Control 2010 Report grades states on their anti-tobacco efforts; in this report, Alabama received straight \\"Fs\\". The state was graded in four categories: * spending on programs to prevent and control tobacco use * statewide smoking restrictions * tax levied on cigarettes * payment for medications and counseling for Medicaid patients and state employees who are trying to quit smoking Alabama ranked right at the bottom in all four categories. For every smoker in Alabama, $993 a year is spent on hospital care as a result of smoking. A national study shows that Alabama's economy suffers $5.6 billion a year in direct costs because of smoking, which also includes more than $1 billion in lost workplace productivity and $1.7 billion in direct medical expenditures.  Smoking costs in Alabama  ‚Ä¢ Alabamians spend $842 million a year on drugs directly as a result of smoking. ‚Ä¢ Nearly $125 million a year is spent by Alabamians in nursing homes directly as a result of smoking. ‚Ä¢ For every smoker in Alabama, $993 a year is spent on hospital care as a result of smoking. ‚Ä¢ Annual health care costs in Alabama directly caused by smoking: $1.49billion ‚Ä¢ Portion covered by the state Medicaid program: $238million ‚Ä¢ Residents' state and federal tax burden from smoking-caused government expenditures: $540. ‚Ä¢Smoking-caused productivity losses in Alabama: $2.24billion.  Alabama bills on smoking  Specific smoking regulatory bills passed in Alabama include the following: *Summary of Bill: Section 22-15A-4 focuses on issues of smoking in public places. It states Alabama's general prohibition against smoking in public arenas and lists four specific exceptions to this law. *Section 22-15A-4 \\"Prohibition against smoking in public places; exceptions. (a) No person shall smoke in a public place or at a public meeting except as otherwise provided in this subsection and in Section 22-15A-7. This prohibition does not apply in any of the following places: (1) Bars and lounges. (2) Retail tobacco stores and tobacco businesses. (3) Limousines used under private hire by an individual or corporation. (4) Hotel and motel rooms rented to guests, except for those rooms designated by the hotels and motels as 'no smoking' rooms. (b) Smoking by patients in a chemical dependency treatment program or mental health program may be allowed in a separated well- ventilated area pursuant to a policy established by the administrator of the program that identifies circumstances in which prohibiting smoking would interfere with the treatment of persons recovering from chemical dependency or mental illness.\\" (Act 2003‚Äì314, p. 770, ¬ß4.) *Summary of Bill: Section 22-15A-6 discusses required designation of smoking areas in public venues. It states forbidden and allowed areas that may be designated, as well as ventilation requirements that must be met in areas where smoking is allowed. *Section 22-15A-6 \\"Designation of smoking areas; requirements; nonsmoking policies.(a) Pursuant to this section, the person in charge of a public place may designate an area for the use of smokers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a smoking area may not be designated and no person may smoke in any of the following unless the area is enclosed and well ventilated: (1) Child care facilities.(2) Hospitals, health care clinics, doctors' offices, physical therapy facilities, and dentists' offices. (3) Elevators. (4) Buses, taxicabs, and other means of public conveyance. (5) Government buildings, except private offices. (6) Restrooms.(7) Service lines. (8) Public areas of aquariums, galleries, libraries, and museums. (9) Lobbies, hallways, and other common areas in apartment buildings, senior citizen residences, nursing homes, and other multiple-unit residential facilities. (10) Polling places.(11) Schools or other school facilities or enclosed school sponsored events for grades K-12. (12) Retail establishments, excluding restaurants, except areas in retail establishments not open to the public. (13) Lobbies, hallways, and other common areas in multiple-unit commercial facilities. (b) If a smoking area is designated, existing physical barriers and ventilation systems shall be used to minimize the toxic effect of smoke, and no more than one-fourth of the total square footage in any public place within a single enclosed area shall be reserved and designated for smokers unless clientele dictates otherwise. No area designated as a smoking area shall contain common facilities which are expected to be used by the public. (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any owner, operator, manager, or other person who controls any establishment or facility from declaring and enforcing a nonsmoking policy in the entire establishment or facility. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or this chapter, if any restaurant is deemed by its owner as being too small to have a designated smoking area, it shall be left up to the discretion of the owner if the facility will be a 'smoking' or a 'nonsmoking' facility.\\" (Act 2003-314, p. 770, ¬ß6.) *Summary of Bill: Section 22-15A-7 explores the technical aspect of non-smoking zones by discussing \\"No Smoking\\" signs, describing the \\"No Smoking\\" diagram, emphasizing the importance of proper placement of signs, and outlining repercussions of non-smoking zone violations. *Section 22-15A-7 \\"Posting of 'No Smoking' and 'Smoking Area' signs; violations of chapter.(a) A 'No Smoking' sign or signs, or the international 'No Smoking' symbol, which consists of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette enclosed in a circle with a bar across, shall be prominently posted and properly maintained where smoking is prohibited by this chapter, by the owner, operator, manager, or other person in charge of the facility. 'Smoking Area' signs shall also be posted as appropriate in public places. (b) The person(s) in charge of a public place who observes a person in possession of a lighted tobacco product in apparent violation of this chapter shall inform that person that smoking is not permitted in that area by law.\\" (Act 2003‚Äì314, p. 770, ¬ß7.) *Summary of Bill: Section 22-15A-10 states that chapter smoking laws will not restrict or supersede county, city, town, or village laws as long as minimum standards are met. *Section 22-15A-10 \\"Local laws, ordinances, or regulations. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the power of any county, city, town, or village to adopt and enforce local laws, ordinances, or regulations that comply with at least the minimum applicable standards set forth in this chapter.\\" (Act 2003‚Äì314, p. 770, ¬ß11.)  Tobacco and Alabama's youth  While the number of high school smokers is at an all-time low, 22.1 percent or 12,400 children under 18 still become new smokers each year. It is estimated that 174,000 kids who are now under the age of 18 and alive in Alabama will ultimately die prematurely from smoking. Furthermore, offsetting the positive trend of reduced smoking rates in youth is an increase in the use of smokeless tobacco products such as snuff, dip, and chew. A new product called \\"Snus,\\" described as a smokeless, spitless, less detectable way to use tobacco is marketed to young users. With higher levels of nicotine than other snuff products, it contains some of the same carcinogens and is more addictive. On the 2009 Auburn City School's Pride Student Survey, 10 percent of 10th graders and one out of seven seniors reported using smokeless tobacco products in the last year. This is a dangerous trend since smokeless tobacco products are not safer, and a user's chance of getting oral cancer is 50 times greater than a non-user.

Quautlatas was known as \\"The Tepehu√°n Prophet\\". The Tepehu√°n and the Spanish The Tepehu√°n were an agricultural people who lived primarily in the future Mexican state of Durango on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Early Spanish explorers described them as numerous but, apparently, a series of epidemics of introduced European diseases reduced their numbers by more than 80 percent. By the time of the revolt their numbers may have been only about 10,000Gradie, Charlotte M. The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616. Salt Lake City: U of UT Press, 2000, pp. 22‚Äì23 Spanish silver miners and ranchers began settling in the Tepehu√°n lands in the 1570s and Jesuit missionaries began work among them in 1596. The Tepehu√°n seemed relatively receptive to the missionaries and by 1615 a Jesuit could declare that the Tepehu√°n ‚Äúshowed great progress and were in the things of our holy faith very Hispanic.Gradie, p. 148 What the Jesuits and other Spaniards did not fully comprehend was that the Tepehu√°n were a people under enormous stress. The recurrent epidemics impoverished them and destroyed their faith in their traditional culture. The missionaries tried to convert them to Christianity by abolishing their religious practices, replacing their leaders with Christians, and introducing Spanish customs. Both missionaries and encomenderos demanded their labor in the mines and the missions and on the ranches. The missionaries perceived they were doing God‚Äôs work by baptizing Indians dying of disease; the Indians equated baptism with death.Gradie, p. 26 The prophet In early 1616, an elderly traditional religious leader, Quautlatas, rose to leadership among the Tepehu√°n and promised to lead them out of bondage. Quautlatas had been baptized a Christian and his message to his people had Christian elements in it. He called himself a bishop and carried a broken cross as his idol. To placate the gods, he said, the Tepehu√°n ‚Äúwould have to cut the throats‚Äù of all Christians. ‚ÄúIt they did not do this they would receive a terrible punishment in the form of illnesses, plagues, and famine. But if they obeyed him, he promised them‚Ä¶victory over the Spaniards. Even if some of them should die in battle, he promised them that within seven days they would be resurrected‚Ä¶. God would create storms at seas, sinking the Spanish ships and thus preventing additional Spaniards from reaching these lands.‚ÄùPerez de Ribas, tr. Reff, Daniel T. History of the Triumphs of our Holy Faith amongst the most Barbarous and Fierce Peoples of the New World. Tucson: U of AZ Press, 1999, pp. 594-595 Quautlatas message was typical of millennial movements such as the Pueblo Revolt led by another messianic figure, Pop√©, in the same century, and much later events such as the Ghost Dance in the U.S. and the Boxer Rebellion in China. Quautlatas promised divine intervention to return to an idealized past in which the plagues and suffering brought upon the Tepehu√°n by the Spanish would disappear. The principal chronicler of the Tepehu√°n Revolt, the Jesuit priest Andres Perez de Ribas, cited the devil as causing the revolt. It was not mistreatment by the Spanish which caused the revolt but rather ‚ÄúSatan who intervened here, with a pure scheme and design, which was received by these blind people. It enraged their spirit to take up arms against the faith of Christ and all that was Christianity‚Ä¶..This was most clearly demonstrated by the diabolical shamans who had intimate dealings with the Devil and were the main force and instigators of the uprising.‚Äù Perez de Ribas compared Quautlatas with the antiChrist.Quoted from Reff, Daniel T. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòPredicament of Culture‚Äô and Spanish Missionary Accounts of the Tepehu√°n and Pueblo Revolts.‚Äù Ethnohistory 42:1 (winter 1995), p. 67 The Revolt Quautlatas did not lead the Tepehu√°n in the revolt which began in November 1616.

(See Tepehu√°n Revolt) The Spanish counterattack in 1617 and 1618 was brutal.

Bill Armstrong announced the show, with substitutes from Johnny Gilbert and Charlie Tuna. Tuna replaced Armstrong about midway through the series' run. It aired on NBC from September 13, 1982 to October 28, 1983, and was videotaped at the network's studios in Burbank, California. Format The hour-long show offered contestants the opportunity to \\"make their dreams come true\\". Each episode typically consisted of four or five segments and was taped before a studio audience. Hosts Marshall and Uggams called audience members whose fantasies were being granted onstage. In most cases, the guests of honor were totally surprised since the show worked with family members, friends, and colleagues of the guests for several weeks in advance of the show tapings to set up the elaborate fantasies. For example, one guest's fantasy was to finally be able to repair and restore his treasured 1971 Opel GT automobile. He never had the time or money to work on the car because he was too busy taking care of his wife and children and usually gave away any extra money he wanted to save to help someone in need. To keep the fantasy a surprise, the show worked with the man's wife, the local police department, and the man's auto insurance company. The producers of the show arranged to \\"borrow\\" the man's car without his knowledge and the wife was to tell her husband that the car had been stolen. Then the man reported the car stolen to the local police department and their insurance company, all of whom were in on the surprise. The show's producers then had the Opel fully restored exactly the way the man wanted to do it. Meanwhile, the wife lured her husband to the studio for the show's taping where he was genuinely surprised to find his car fully restored and presented to him free of charge. The show received anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000 letters per week from viewers across the United States wanting their fantasies fulfilled. The show's producers carefully reviewed each request to find ones that would be entertaining enough to use on the show. Many of the letters received were simply requests for money according to the show's mailroom supervisor Kathy Hassett in a 1983 TV Guide interview. Those letters usually ended up in the trash can. Hassett told TV Guide that \\"We're looking for human interest and funny fantasies such as people who want to find their long-lost relatives, jump from an airplane, or meet their favorite TV star.\\" To add some variety to the show, audience members were sometimes selected at random to come onstage to receive prizes by playing a game. One popular feature of the show was a glass money booth similar to one used on the short-lived 1975 game show The Diamond Head Game. An audience member was placed in the booth while a wind machine blew around dollar bills of various denominations. The player was given a time limit to grab as many bills as possible and stuff them in a bag provided. In another regular segment called \\"Fantasy Forum\\", host Marshall called three audience members onstage where they could voice their opinions on national TV on a topic of their choice for one minute. The audience then voted for the person they thought did the best job with the winner receiving a prize. Celebrity guests joined hosts Marshall and Uggams each day to help with the elaborate fantasies. Among the celebrities who appeared on Fantasy included Tom Wopat, Andy Gibb, Jed Allen, and Sylvester Stallone. Reception Fantasy was nominated for six Daytime Emmy Awards, with Uggams winning one in 1983 for Outstanding Host in a Variety Series. She was nominated for the same category in 1984. Broadcast history The show aired each weekday afternoon from 3-4 pm (ET) where it faced off against CBS' Guiding Light and ABC's General Hospital. Fantasy was later replaced by another game show, The Match Game- Hollywood Squares Hour in October 1983. The series has not been seen in reruns since its cancellation, with the exception of one 1982 episode which aired on Game Show Network in the mid-1990s.

ISSN 0891-1851 Design and development The M-Squared line of aircraft was started in 1996 when a former Quicksilver Manufacturing employee, Paul Mather, decided to offer retrofit kits to convert the Quicksilver II from cable-braced wings to a strut-braced configuration with jury struts. The kits proved popular and Mather expanded to market complete aircraft based on the basic Quicksilver layout. The first two aircraft in the series were the two- seat double surface wing Sport 1000 and the two-seat single surface wing Sprint 1000. The series all share similar construction featuring a bolted aluminium tube structure with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. All models are open-cockpit, but some have optional streamlined pods available. All models use tricycle landing gear and steerable nosewheels. The Breese 2 DS and SS have been accepted by the US Federal Aviation Administration as approved special light-sport aircraft.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 67.

The film stars Jim Brown, Ed McMahon, Don Stroud, Brock Peters, Gloria Hendry and Dick Anthony Williams. The film was released on August 31, 1973, by American International Pictures. It is the sequel to the 1972 film Slaughter. Plot Slaughter (Jim Brown), a fierce Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret, had avenged the death of his parents by killing the gangster who was responsible for their death in Mexico. He is now relocated in Los Angeles, California, a place that Slaughter sought to escape the past events and begin his attempt to have a tranquil life. Slaughter goes to a friend's house for a lavish outdoor picnic and celebration. Meanwhile, a new crime boss, Duncan (Ed McMahon), is now after Slaughter, for having killed ex Mafia boss Dominic Hoffo earlier. An old World War I biplane is seen flying by the outdoor celebration and then opening fire on the guests at the picnic. It results in the graphic death by headshot of Slaughter's friend, which reignites the old spark of fury and rage that Slaughter had when told of the death of his parents. Duncan's first assassination attempt in essence is a failure and only succeeds in waking a sleeping beast. Duncan hires a new hit-man named Kirk (Don Stroud) to bring Slaughter to his demise. Rather than being in protective custody under the supervision of Duncan's crooked cops, Slaughter remains on the streets. Slaughter's new friend is a police official, Det. Reynolds, who warns that his life is in peril. Slaughter also has a girlfriend, Marcia (Gloria Hendry), who is also being targeted by the mob, under Duncan's orders, to further provoke Slaughter. Slaughter makes an agreement with Reynolds to obtain confidential documents of the Mafia's operations. He coaxes a drug-addicted pimp to assist him in breaking into Duncan's safe house and successfully escape with the documents. After gun fights, Slaughter and his pimp sidekick kill several of Duncan's guards and associates. In response, Duncan sends Kirk to kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend, a fatal mistake on Duncan's part.

She is best known for her book Empire of Dirt, one of the first academic monographs on indie music in the context of live concerts. and for her column Ask the Indie Professor in The Guardian. Her areas of expertise include ritual, performance and the music industry. Life and career Wendy Fonarow was born in Los Angeles and studied applied mathematics and anthropology at University of California in San Diego, where she also worked at the campus radio station KSDT. At the time the station featured post-punk British bands and underground dance music. Milo Aukerman of the Descendants also attended UCSD at the same time. The band covered the Beach Boys' song \\"Wendy\\" for her. The song was later included on The Descendant's album Enjoy! After graduating, she continued to attend concerts in Los Angeles. In 1989, Fonarow attended the first Reading festival with a new promoter the Mean Fiddler. Mean Fiddler's participation changed the direction of the festival from heavy rock to the burgeoning genre of indie music. As an American, she was unable to purchase tickets internationally and was therefore added to the guest list of the Irish band, Something Happens who gave her backstage access. Her experiences at this indie music festival eventually became the inspiration for her PhD thesis on indie and live music performance. She completed her masters research on Contemporary Halloween Practices and went on to research the practices of audiences at UCLA.. She is frequently cited in and writes for popular media as an expert on Halloween, music, and pop culture. In 1993, she arrived in London to begin fieldwork on indie music and live performance and was introduced to Laurence Bell, the founder of Domino Recording Company. Fonarow was subsequently hired as Domino Records first employee. Fonarow worked closely with artists such as Slowdive, Ride and Mogwai in the initial phase of her research and continued to document indie audiences until mobile phones radically changed participation at concerts. She returned to Los Angeles, and between 1995 and 1997 worked at Reprise Records and at MCA Records as a talent scout and A&R; manager while continuing to teach Cultural and Linguistic Anthropology at UCLA.

History =Gauda and Pandua= Gauda was once the ‚Äúcapital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.‚Äù During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, ‚Äúthe city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.‚Äù ‚ÄúPandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans‚Äù‚Ä¶ With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi‚Ä¶ the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal,,, Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. =Malda district= With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focused on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with ‚Äúsome portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts‚Äù. A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Bhakri, a constituent gram panchayat of Chanchal II block, is located at . Chanchal II CD Block is part of the Tal, one of the three physiographic sub-regions of the district. ‚ÄúThe Tal region gradually slopes down towards the south-west and merges with the Diara sub- region‚Ä¶ (it) is strewn with innumerable marshes, bils and oxbow lakes.‚Äù The sub-region largely remains submerged during the monsoons and during the dry season large sections of it turn into mud banks with many shallow marshes scattered around. With hardly any gradient the rivers crawl through the region. The Mahananda River flows along the eastern boundary of the CD Block and the district. The Baramasia River forms the western boundary of the CD Block with Harishachndrapur II CD Block. Chanchal II CD Block is bounded by Chanchal I CD Block on the north, Itahar CD Block of Uttar Dinajpur district on the east, Ratua II and Ratua I CD Blocks on the south and Harishchandrapur II and Harishchandrapur I CD Blocks on the east.

Population density in the district has intensified from 162 persons per km2 in 1901 to 881 in 2001 (i.e., around five times), which is highest amongst the districts of North Bengal. However, unlike the densely populated southern regions of West Bengal, urbanisation remains low in Malda district. North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, ‚ÄúMalda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.‚Äù There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border. Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Chanchal II CD Block was 99,129 (57.38% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 53,185 (59.97% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 45,944 (54.66% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 5.31%. See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother tongue of 88.1% of the population of Malda district followed by Santali (4.5%) Khortha/Khotta (4.4%), Hindi (1.2%), Bhojpuri (0.4%), Telugu (0.3%), Kurukh/ Oraon (0.2%) and Koda/ Kora (0.1%). While the percentage of population reporting Bengali as a mother tongue has increased from 83.6 in 1961 Census to 88.1 in 2001 Census, the percentage of population reporting Santali as mother tongue has decreased from 7.2 in 1961 Census to 4.5 in 2001 Census. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years. The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Muslims numbered 114,782 and formed 69.48% of the population in Chanchal II CD Block. Hindus numbered 48,626 and formed 29.44% of the population. Christians numbered 98 and formed 0.06% of the population. Others numbered 1,686 and formed 1.02% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference. We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in Chanchal II CD Block was 43.9%. Official surveys of households living in absolute poverty in Malda district have been found to be around 39%. According to the report, ‚ÄúAn overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Economy =Livelihood= In Chanchal II CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 16,531 and formed 23.40%, agricultural labourers numbered 38,816 and formed 54.94%, household industry workers numbered 2,203 and formed 3.12% and other workers numbered 13,096 and formed 18.54%.

Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Chanchal I CD Block was 115,746 (65.09% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 62,693 (68.76% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 53,053 (61.22% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 7.55%. See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother tongue of 88.1% of the population of Malda district followed by Santali (4.5%) Khortha/Khotta (4.4%), Hindi (1.2%), Bhojpuri (0.4%), Telugu (0.3%), Kurukh/ Oraon (0.2%) and Koda/ Kora (0.1%). While the percentage of population reporting Bengali as a mother tongue has increased from 83.6 in 1961 Census to 88.1 in 2001 Census, the percentage of population reporting Santali as mother tongue has decreased from 7.2 in 1961 Census to 4.5 in 2001 Census. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years. The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Muslims numbered 122,055 and formed 70.06% of the population in Chanchal I CD Block. Hindus numbered 51,831 and formed 29.75% of the population. Christians numbered 20 and formed 0.01% of the population. Others numbered 298 and formed 0.18% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference. We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in Chanchal I CD Block was 50.0%. Official surveys of households living in absolute poverty in Malda district have been found to be around 39%. According to the report, \\"An overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ \\" Economy =Livelihood= In Chanchal I CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 15,994 and formed 20.55%, agricultural labourers numbered 41,532 and formed 53.37%, household industry workers numbered 1,983 and formed 2.55% and other workers numbered 18,317 and formed 23.54%.

When We Were Colored is a 1996 American period drama film directed by Tim Reid and the screenplay was written by Paul W. Cooper, the film is based on Clifton Taulbert‚Äôs real life and his non-fiction book Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored. Plot The film takes place in Glen Allan, Mississippi, during the mid-20th century. In the early stages of the film, the audience gains more knowledge regarding Cliff‚Äôs upbringing. His biological mother was too young to take care of him and was not able to provide Cliff with financial support therefore he was raised by his extended family. Ma Pearl and Poppa begin to take care of him but after a couple of years, Ma Ponk begins to take care of Cliff and ultimately raises him, with the help of Poppa. Ma Pearl‚Äôs character is played by Paula Kelly, and Ma Ponk‚Äôs character is played by Phylicia Rashad. Poppa‚Äôs character is played by Al Freeman, Jr.; Ma Ponk, Poppa, and Cliff are the three main characters in the film. Another scene that occurs early on in the film which helps to portray the racial climate during the 1950s in the South, is when Cliff and Poppa attend a parade hosted by the Ku Klux Klan and are confronted for being African Americans by a violent Ku Klux Klan member. As the film progresses, it is known that Cliff lives in a low-income, rural place where almost every adult is a laborer, most commonly a field worker. This is known when the narrator mentions that Cliff attends school in a single bungalow where his classmates are the children of servants, illiterate farm workers, poor field workers, and maids. Even his caregiver, Ma Ponk works in a cotton field picking cotton for a white farmer. Also, the majority of the people living in this small town are part of a Christian church where at times they come together and unite to stay strong against the social injustices placed upon them. Ma Ponk is religious and is an active participant in her local Christian church since she attends mass regularly and is part of the church‚Äôs gospel choir. As the film progresses even more, the audience has the chance to see Cliff grow up into a hard- working young man with positive aspirations of becoming educated. Cliff begins working for an older white woman, Ms. Mavory, who begins to show an interest in educating and enlightening Cliff. She asks him if he likes to read and he says yes therefore she then begins to make trips to the local library and checks out books for Cliff to read. One book that she checks out for Cliff is Homer's Iliad. Cliff reads it and mentions to Cleve that he actually enjoys reading the book. The fact that Cliff enjoys reading great classics and strives to excel in school shows that he does want to make a positive change in society. He does not make a radical change but instead makes a subtle positive change by choosing to work hard and continue his education. When Cliff grows older and finishes his high school education, he leaves his hometown to migrate North. He leaves the South in hope of finding a better life and reaching his dreams.

Career Tommy Bedford won the first of his 25 caps against Australia as a flank forward on 13 July 1963. Though he appeared as a 21-year- old flank forward in six Test matches, it was the number 8 position that established him as a player of outstanding quality on the international scene. A very athletic and dynamic number 8 he formed a remarkably efficient and complementary back-row partnership with Jan Ellis and Piet Greyling. He made his debut against the Lions in an historic Test at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria - the first ever international in which replacements were allowed for injury, though no more than four players per team could be replaced in a match at the time. He played number 8 in all four Tests against the 1968 Lions with South Africa winning the tightly-fought series 3-0, with one drawn, when in both the first and third Tests the winning margin was only five points. The young Durban architect, who captained his provincial team Natal, also led his country three times, against Australia (twice) and Scotland on the 1969 tour to Britain and Ireland. Despite his prowess as a player and captain, it is thought that his relentless and uncompromising criticism of the apartheid system and the rugby establishment contributed to a premature end of his playing career. He retired from international rugby after the drawn Test with France in Durban in 1971. Professionally, he was an architect who, in 1965, was elected a Rhodes scholar.

United States Uglow visited New York City for three weeks, in 1968, moving there permanently, in 1969. He soon met, and was befriended by, fellow painters, Jake Berthot, Brice Marden, and Winston Roeth. In the early 1970s, Uglow and Roeth printed for Petersburg Press. In 1974, Uglow moved from his loft on Greene Street to one on the Bowery, where he lived and worked until his death.* In 1974 and 1976, Uglow was in group shows at Bykert Gallery, (founded by Klaus Kertess and Jeff Byers). In 1975, his work was included in the Whitney Biennial. After Kertess left Bykert, Uglow was asked by Mary Boone, former Bykert secretary, to join a new gallery she was planning to open. January 7, 1978, Mary Boone Gallery, 420 W. Broadway, opened with paintings by Chris Darton; Gordon Hart; Paul Mogensen; Gary Stephan; Alan Uglow. Uglow‚Äôs first one-person painting show with Boone, in 1978, opened concurrently with a one-person drawing show, Susan Caldwell Gallery, curated by Michael Walls. After a second one-person painting show at Boone, in 1979, Uglow left Mary Boone Gallery. He subsequently joined Lorence- Monk Gallery, (1985‚Äì1991), and Stark Gallery (1993‚Äì2002). At Lorence-Monk, Uglow first exhibited his \\"low rider\\" paintings. It was also at Lorence-Monk that Uglow showed Signals, (1988), a four-panel piece, with sound, initially made to be shown as part of \\"Century '87,\\" Amsterdam. At Stark, Uglow showed another sound piece, his football-inspired, Coach's Bench. Beginning in 1992, and continuing throughout 2009, Uglow made a series of paintings, titled Standards: all are 7' x 6' (214 x 183 cm), installed on wooden blocks. Related to those paintings is Portrait of a Standard, a series of silk screens, using the Standard paintings as subject, and of the same dimensions and use of blocks. In 2013, Uglow's work was shown posthumously in New York City, in a solo exhibition, at David Zwirner, curated by Bob Nickas (with catalogue). In 2014, MIT List Visual Arts Center, (Cambridge, MA), held an exhibition of Uglow‚Äôs Standards and Portraits, curated by Jo√£o Ribas. From the 1970s onwards, Uglow was included in numerous group shows, in galleries and museums, in the United States and Europe. Europe and Scandinavia Alan Uglow‚Äôs first one-person show, outside the United States, was in 1983, Galerie Nordenhake, founded by Claes Nordenhake, in Malm√∂, Sweden. Uglow continued to show with the gallery in Malm√∂ and Stockholm, and in Berlin, Germany; his final show with Galerie Nordenhake was 2006, Berlin. In 1984, Uglow showed ‚ÄúSignal,‚Äù a structured, two-part painting, as well as one other discrete painting, at Gunther Umberg's Raum f√ºr Malerai (Room for Painting), Cologne, Germany. Beginning in 1988 through 2010, Uglow had an extended professional and personal relationship with Milco Onrust (1961‚Äì2015), and Boudi Eskens‚Äîwho joined the gallery in 1992‚Äîshowing initially with Galeri Onrust on the Prinsengracht, and later in their space on Planciusstraat, Amsterdam, NL. *In 1986,1992, and part of 1993, Uglow and his wife, the poet and writer, Elena Alexander, lived in Cologne, Germany. _____ References External links\\"A Tribute to Alan Uglow\\" The Brooklyn Rail (April 2011), by Medrie MacPhee, Stephen J.

A major Polish resistance organization in the Pomerania region, at its height in 1943 it might have had as many as 20,000 members, although only about 500 were active partisans in the forests (le≈õni). Piotr Szubarczyk, Z historii TOW ‚ÄúGryf Pomorski‚Äù, Bibu≈Ça: Pismo Niezale≈ºne, 2010-03-15 The name of the organization referred to the traditional coat of arms of Pomerania, which consists of either the black (for Gdansk Pomerania) or the red (for Western Pomerania) griffin. Formation After the German invasion of Poland, Polish Pomeranian territories were annexed into the German (Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia). As elsewhere in Poland, resistance organizations soon appeared. Historia , Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa GRYF POMORSKI, on the pages of the UrzƒÖd Marsza≈Çkowski Wojew√≥dztwa Pomorskiego The Pomeranian Griffin organization was created on July 7, 1941 in Czarna DƒÖbrowahttp://forum.danzig.de/showthread.php?11624-Interview-Gerhard- Jeske-1980-In-der-Kachubei-versteckt near Byt√≥w, out of three smaller predecessor organizations: the Kashubian Griffin secret military organization (Tajna Organizacjia Wojskowa \\"Gryf Kaszubski\\"), the Military Organization for Independence (Wojskowa Organizacja Niepodleg≈Ço≈õciowa), and a partisan unit codenamed \\"Zawisza\\" (after Zawisza the Black). According to Polish historian Tomasz Strzembosz, the groundwork for the organization might have been laid down before the war by Colonel Ludwik Muzyczki. Operations The organization's charter stressed its Catholic nature and declared its purpose as self-defense, aid to the Polish population of Pomerania in the face of German terror, and preparation for an eventual uprising against Nazi Germany. In addition to sabotage operations carried out by its forest partisan units, the organization was active in spreading anti-Nazi propaganda and in intelligence activities (notably, the Pomeranian Griffin was involved in the intelligence gathering on the V-1 and V-2 rockets). The organization declared itself subordinate to the Polish Government in Exile in London, and cooperated with the military structures of the Polish Underground State (Armia Krajowa, the \\"Home Army\\") but stressed its regional autonomy. In 1943 internal ideological conflicts escalated during negotiations over the subordination of the organization to the main Polish anti-Nazi resistance movement, the Home Army. Polish resistance structures in Pomerania had suffered more than their fair share of arrests, and Griffin leaders were wary of opening themselves up to a larger structure. Furthermore, whereas the Home Army and the government in exile were run by a coalition of several parties, Griffin, while officially apolitical, was mostly influenced by the National Democrats. A portion of the Griffin split to join the Miecz i Plug (Sword and Plow) nationalist movement. However, Miecz i Plug had been infiltrated by the Gestapo or, according to other sources, by NKVD agents who first framed existing leaders for collaboration and then proceeded to establish real contacts with the Gestapo. Either way, as a result, many of the conspirators of the Griffin were compromised, arrested by the Nazis, and sent to Nazi concentration camps. A modern reconstruction of a Pomeranian Griffin forest bunker The remnants of the group survived until 1945, when the final order of its last commander instructed the soldiers to participate in the disarming of local German police forces and to provide logistic aid to the approaching Red Army. However, once Pomerania came under Soviet control, members of the group were persecuted and arrested by the Soviet authorities because of the organization's pro-Catholic and nationalistic character. Many of the group's members who were arrested during this time ended up being sent to the gulag by the Soviets, alongside the same German soldiers and Gestapo agents against whom they fought during the war; others were executed. Some historians argue that Griffin soldiers were treated much more harshly than even the Armia Krajowa and the cursed soldiers members. In arresting the group's members the Soviet authorities often relied on information provided by former Gestapo agents who had infiltrated the group during the war and who had switched sides once Soviet victory was imminent. Members Two of the Pomeranian Griffin's most notable members were Lieutenant J√≥zef Dambek, Griffin's leader, and Colonel-Chaplain J√≥zef Wrycza, a widely respected Roman Catholic priest. After Lieutenant Dambek was killed by the Germans in 1944, he was succeeded by Lieutenant Augustyn Westphal.

Dr. Charles Marks' formative years, written and directed by first time writer/director Mark Young. It explores issues of self-determination in the face of systemic racial persecution in the United States in the mid-1960s.  Plot  In the opening minutes of the film, Richard Kelly (played by Cedric Sanders), is behind bars, having been arrested during the infamous Watts Riots for allegedly assaulting a police officer. Though he maintains that he is innocent, Kelly is convicted. At his sentencing he is presented with a choice between serving jail time and serving probation for one year as a student at an all-white Christian theological seminary. Kelly faces overt hostility from his fellow students and confusion over his place in the school from the faculty. He has the support and encouragement from the President of the Seminary (played by William Devane), up until he begins to attempt to introduce institutional changes which would lead to further racial integration of the student body and inclusion of racial minorities on the faculty. At that point, the President turns against him, fearing the loss of funding from the seminary's benefactors. As his situation at the seminary worsens, Kelly seeks out the advice and counsel of the groundskeeper, Sam (Louis Gossett, Jr.). Sam places his own job in jeopardy by supporting Kelly's attempts at institutional change. Though his employment is terminated for a time, he is eventually reinstated. Kelly's project to integrate the student body and the faculty is successful, and he decides to remain at the seminary even after his probationary period ended.

Newman and starring Edmond O'Brien, Joanne Dru and Otto Kruger.. Plot Knowing how much telephone repairman Mal Granger (Edmond O'Brien) likes to bet on the horses, small-time bookmaker Chippie Evans (Sammy White) proposes a scheme in which Granger's technical expertise would provide gangster Vince Walters (Barry Kelley) with race results in advance. Granger accepts and also takes an interest in Walters' attractive assistant, Trudy (Dorothy Patrick), but she is arrested. Granger's new method of getting track information to the bookies makes him invaluable. He threatens to cut Walters off unless he is made a 20% partner. Walters gives in. When Walters tries to collect from a bookie who owes him, the bookie kills first Walters, then himself. Granger takes control of the wire service, making him a target for Lieutenant Wright (Howard St. John) of the Los Angeles Police. East Coast mobster Larry Mason (Don Porter) is sent by boss Carl Stephans (Otto Kruger) to persuade Granger to join the Syndicate. He travels west with his wife Gail (Joanne Dru). Granger decides to accept a 50/50 split with his new partners. Some of the independent bookies do not like the new arrangement (and the extra 20% \\"protection\\" fee) and refuse to go along. They are roughed up by Syndicate goons. Trudy returns to work for Granger; she finds out he is being shortchanged. When he complains, Granger is told that the shortfall is due to \\"necessary expenses.\\" He vows to get his money. Granger and Gail are strongly attracted to each other. Mason beats Gail, after which Granger hires a hitman named Gizzi (Robert Osterloh) to kill Mason with a rifle. Gizzi decides to blackmail Granger, who agrees to pay $25,000 at a rendezvous at the Malibu Pier, but there Gizzi announces he intends to become Granger's silent partner. Granger crushes him to death against the pier's railing with his car. Using his telephone know-how, Granger places a call to Wright that makes it appear he is in Palm Springs and has an alibi. Wright tapes the call and hears a streetcar whistle; there are no streetcars in Palm Springs. The police eventually match the paint from Granger's damaged car to Gizzi's murder. Granger decides to retire and escape to Guatemala, but first, he sets out to collect what is owed to him. With the help of Gail and Chippie, he taps into a phone line to a mob betting parlor in Las Vegas and pulls off a pass-post swindle. Intercepting and taping race results to be replayed after a two- minute delay, he gives Gail and Chippie time to place substantial bets. Chippie, however, is recognized by a man who bears a grudge against Granger. He tells Stevens, who has Chippie brought to him and learns where Granger can be found. Stevens passes the information along to Wright, content to let the police rid him of a troublesome colleague. With the police closing in, Granger and Gail flee to Boulder Dam, trying to cross state lines to get out of Wright's jurisdiction, but encounter a roadblock there. They join a tour group and descend into the dam. Gail collapses from fatigue while running, then Granger is killed before he can find his way to the Arizona side.

Certainly no one who reads the papers with a fairly retentive eye can have any less comprehension of the gambling racket than is illustrated here...In short, this little picture, conventionally written but well photographed, does no more than any gangster picture in reminding us that gangsters are crooks.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, July 20, 1950. Accessed: February 15, 2011. However, Variety wrote well of the film: \\"Operations of the syndicates are given a realistic touch by the screenplay, and Joseph M. Newman's direction keeps action at a fast pace.

Both the book and this compilation were key documents in the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, and many of its songs would either be incorporated into new compositions by later musicians, or covered outright. Background Recordings of the music known as country blues derived from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s, commencing after the proven commercial appeal of classic female blues and ending when the Great Depression greatly curtailed the market for the record industry. These recordings had all been collected on 78s, and with the exceptions of top-sellers like Lonnie Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson, pressings rarely exceeded approximately 5000 or so.The Country Blues liner notes retrieved 21/02/11 At the time of the issue of this record, the catalogue of country blues music on long-playing album was fairly small.

Her family had been wealthy prior to the Russian revolution, but the community faced persecution under the communist regime due to their pacifist beliefs and heritage. In 1941, when she was five years old, her father was deported to Siberia. Fleeing the Red Army, she ended up in Germany with her mother in 1945. After several years as a refugee, they emigrated to an isolated Mennonite community of Volendam in the rainforests of Paraguay in 1948, with the help of Dutch and American Mennonites. In Paraguay, she married and had one son. The family immigrated to Canada in 1960, settling in St. Catharines, Ontario, where their second son was born, and then to the United States in 1967, where she eventually became a US citizen. In 1971, she graduated from Wichita State University with a bachelor's degree. She earned a Master's and then, in 1979, a doctorate of education (Ed.D) from the University of the Pacific, California. http://soaringeaglesgallery.com/who-is- irz.html Rimland worked as an educational psychologist in California public schools, specializing in special education and migrant education for children. She later worked in the state as an education consultant and testing specialist in an area consisting of six school districts comprising approximately 40 schools, and simultaneously running a private practice in child psychology.  Literary works  Most of her literary work is autobiographical to various extents. Her 1977 novel The Wanderers traces the decimation of the pacifist Russian Mennonite community during the Russian Revolution, anarchy, famine, the Stalinist purges, escape from Ukraine, and eventual resettlement in the rain forests of Paraguay. Her 1984 book, The Furies and the Flame, is her autobiography as an immigrant and deals with her struggle to raise her handicapped child. In her third, and least known, book, Demon Doctor, Rimland tells of her quest to find Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele in the 1980s with the help of, notably, Simon Wiesenthal. She had believed that Mengele worked as a doctor in her Paraguayan Mennonite community of Volendam, but was unable to prove this.James C. Juhnke, Ingrid Rimland, the Mennonites, and the Demon Doctor, Mennonite Life, vol. 60 no. 1, 2005 Her trilogy Lebensraum (literally, \\"life-space\\"), was written after her conversion to Holocaust denial in the 1990s and is a \\"Mennonite history saga, permeated with anti-Semitism and romantic German nationalism.\\" Relationship with Ernst Z√ºndel In September 1994, Rimland first met German Holocaust denier Ernst Z√ºndel, who then resident in Canada, at the twelfth International Revisionist Conference held by the Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denying organisation.

Juhnke, Ingrid Rimland, the Mennonites, and the Demon Doctor, Mennonite Life, vol. 60 no. 1, 2005 Around 2011, Rimland produced the film Off Your Knees, Germany! which were about Z√ºndel's two trials in Canada for deliberately publishing \\"false news\\" about the Holocaust. (Ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada decided the law on \\"false news\\" was unconstitutional.) It depicted Z√ºndel as a victim of Jewish interests supposedly conspiring to deny him the right to convey his opinions on Germany and the Second War War.

It is one of four superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina. Stylonuroidea, which lived from the Early Silurian to the Late Devonian, were characterized by their last pair of prosomal (head) appendages, which were developed as walking legs, or less commonly developed as swimming legs with paddles formed by the expansion of the two or three penultimate joints. 1955\\\\. Merostomata. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part P Arthropoda 2, Chelicerata, P36. as Stylonuracea  Description  Stylonuroids are designated as stylonurines with flattened or truncated posterior metastomata margins. Of the four stylonurine superfamilies, the Stylonuroidea is the most poorly known. Whilst the topology of most stylonurine clades fit well with the stratigraphic record, Stylonuroidea is an exception in that the earliest record of the most derived genera (Ctenopterus and Laurieipterus) first appear at the same time as the earliest record of the most primitive genera (Parastylonurus and Stylonurella). Sweep-feeding strategies evolved independently in two of the four stylonurine superfamilies, the Stylonuroidea and the Hibbertopteroidea. In both superfamilies, the adaptations to this lifestyle involves modifications to the spines on their anterior prosomal appendages for raking through the substrate of their habitats. Stylonuroids have fixed spines on appendages II-IV which could have been used as dragnets to rake through the sediments and thus entangling anything in their way.  Systematics and genera  Due to the majority of specimens being incomplete, the internal topology of the Stylonuroidea is among the least well-resolved and supported in the Stylonurina and the Eurypterida at large. This is mostly due to the poor fossil record of many of the genera included within the superfamily, for instance the single known specimen of Stylonurus powriensis lacks the anterior prosomal appendages and virtually all ventral structures. Similar situations can be seen in many specimens, such as Stylonurella spinipes not preserving the metastoma or pretelson and telson and Pagea sturrocki lacking all dorsal structures. The lack of fossil remains compounds the problem the internal systematics. For instance, the family Parastylonuridae is likely paraphyletic but it is retained as it is due to the lack of complete specimens of the genera included within it, Parastylonurus and Stylonurella.

Garrard's works have been exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery, the British Council maintained Great Britain pavilion at the 1984 Venice Biennale, and national galleries in Austria and Canada. Rose Garrard with her work Spirit of Hope in Bretby, Derbyshire  Early life and education  Rose Garrard was born in Bewdley, Worcestershire, her family moving to Malvern when she was three months old. For many years her mother was the proprietor of Collector‚Äôs Corner, an antique shop in Malvern. Her father who combined life as an artist with a career as a soldier, ran the Middle East College of Art in the Sahara Desert after the Second World War to rehabilitate officers to civilian life, receiving the MBE in 1953. Garrard received her foundation qualification for Art & Design from Stourbridge College of Art in 1965. Garrard went on to achieve a 1st Class Honours Degree in Sculpture from Birmingham School of Art in 1969 before receiving a Higher Diploma in Sculpture from Chelsea College of Arts in 1970. Garrard received a scholarship from the British Council/French Government to attend the Ecole de Beaux Arts, Paris from 1970‚Äì1971 where she won the Prix d'Honneur Gold Medal for Sculpture in 1971.  Early artistic career  Since the late 1960s Garrard's artistic practice has been engaged with ideas concerning gender, identity, status and power, binding together personal experiences and historical references. After her Graduate Show 'Boundaries' in 1969 Garrard won the Multiples International Prize, judged by Eduardo Paolozzi at Modern Art Oxford before exhibiting her \\"especially fascinating\\" sculptures of translucent perspex shrouded female figures at venues including Serpentine Gallery. In 1977 Garrard had her first solo exhibition Incidents in a Garden at Acme Gallery, Covent Garden, which included performance art as well as sculpture and included the artwork 'Monument' featuring a bronze patina of Hitler and Churchill seated having tea. For the 1983 solo exhibition Frames of Mind at Kettles Yard, Garrard challenged the art historical assumption that women should be contained by the artistic frame (as a model) rather than be seen as creator or artist themselves. For Models Triptych, an artwork created for this exhibition Garrard depicts three female artists who were well-known during their lifetimes, but immediately fell into posthumous obscurity, in open frames, intending them to be seen as Pandoras escaping from their boxes. In the consequential exploration of \\"historical reclamation and self recovery\\", Garrard then took up a three month artist residency in 1984 at Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery in which she examined the virtual absence of women artists and the attribution of anonymous works to male artists in the Museum's historical collection.  Accident and later artistic practice  In 1988 Garrard was involved in a serious road traffic accident which meant she spent time in the fractures ward of St Bartholomew's Hospital and caused her left arm to be in a cast. During her time in hospital Garrard was inspired to create works for her commission for the 1988 Biennale of Experimental Art, including Out of Line, an installation and live work featuring recordings with patients, plaster casts of body parts and a video showing accidents reported on television news. The accident also inspired a series of mixed media drawings entitled 'Talisman' based on an ancient gnostic text 'The Thunder, Perfect Mind' which was re-discovered in 1946. Garrard found the text strengthening during her healing period and created artwork based on the images she visualised from the text. In the early 1990s Garrard explored a new direction of multi disciplined practice during artist residencies at New Art Gallery in Calgary and Vancouver Art Gallery. These residencies involved site specific installations in which Garrard would talk with members of the public, focussing on their experience of oppression and from which she would create visual images and explore local issues and concerns. Garrard repeated this format of artistic practice during her 1994 retrospective entitled Archiving my own History, documentation of works 1969 > 1994 at Cornerhouse. In 1995 Garrard moved her studio from London back to the Malvern Hills. In response to local newspaper appeals for ideas to help regenerate Great Malvern, she proposed ‚ÄúThe Spring Water Arts Project‚Äù, the creation of a new sculpture trail to reclaim lost spring sites throughout the town. Among her sculptures created after her move back to the Malvern Hills are the Enigma Fountain including the statue of Sir Edward Elgar (Unveiled by The Duke of York on Belle Vue Terrace, Great Malvern on 26 May 2000).

A protracted political crisis ensued, with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces taking control of the country until a series of popular elections, which are thought to have been tampered with, brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power. However, disputes between elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and secularists continued until the anti-government protests in June 2013 that led to the overthrow of Morsi in 2013, in what has been variably described as a coup d'√©tat or as an ending to the second revolution, or both. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who announced the overthrow of Morsi, then became the leader of Egypt the following year, winning election to the presidency in a landslide victory described by EU observers as free but not necessarily fair. Nonetheless, Sisi's election was widely recognized, and the political situation has largely stabilized since he officially took power; however, some protests have continued despite a government crackdown. The crisis has also worsened an ongoing insurgency led by Ansar Bait al-Maqdis in the Sinai Peninsula, which became increasingly intertwined with the regional conflict against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant later in 2014. Background Before Mubarak took command of the Egyptian government, the third President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, had been in office since 1970. President Sadat had significantly changed the course of Egypt, reinstating a multi-party system and allowing for an increase in foreign investment, among other measures. Also, during Sadat's presidency Egypt both fought in the Yom Kippur War against Israel and, five years later, successfully negotiated the Camp David Accords; this allowed the country to regain sovereignty over the Sinai Peninsula that Israel had been in control of since 1967. Because of these negotiations and their outcome, both he and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, which made Sadat the first Muslim Nobel laureate. On 6 October 1981, President Sadat was assassinated in Cairo during the annual celebrations of Operation Badr by members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an Islamist terrorist group. About a week after Sadat's assassination, then Vice-President Hosni Mubarak took office as president, an action that was approved through a referendum of the People's Assembly. During his presidency, Mubarak pursued policies similar to those of his predecessor, including a commitment to the Camp David Accords; these negotiations are thought to be one of the reasons Egyptian Islamic Jihad members decided to assassinate President Sadat. Additionally, Mubarak continued to work to ensure the gradual decrease in the military's influence and control over Egyptian politics, a decrease begun under Anwar Sadat, with Mubarak replacing many military elites with appointments from the Ministry of Interior instead, and less than 10% of ministerial appointments coming from the military by 2010. The significant economic liberalization of Egypt's economy under Mubarak also led to a drastic reduction in defense expenditures by 2010, compared to previous decades, thereby significantly reducing the military's role in the economy. This gradual reshuffling of power under the Sadat and Mubarak regimes led to tensions between Mubarak's government and the military. Another cause for discontent among Egyptian citizens was Mubarak's administration's disputed human rights record. In this context, and after nearly 30 years of Mubarak's rule, the President was ousted following 18 days of demonstrations in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution of 2011. Events =Revolution= Unhappiness among many Egyptians with the autocratic of 30-year of Dictatorship of President Hosni Mubarak boiled over in late January 2011 amid the Arab Spring, a series of popular protests and uprisings across the region. Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians occupied several public places across Egypt, including Cairo's Tahrir Square, holding out despite efforts by Mubarak loyalists and police to dislodge them, most notably during the infamous \\"Battle of the Camel\\". In the beginning, tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in Suez and Alexandria. The government took a hard line, using riot-control tactics, and shutting down the internet and telecom networks. But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. Mubarak offered some concessions, such as appointing Omar Suleiman to the long-vacant office of vice president. He also announced that he would not seek re-election. None of these satisfied protesters, and under international pressure and lacking the support of Egypt's powerful military. On 10 February 2011 Mubarak handed over power to Suleiman and resigned as president the following day. According to a government fact-finding mission's report the 18-day uprising left at least 846 civilians killed and more than 6,400 injured . Initiation of the Protests The Muslim Brotherhood's support of and participation in the Egyptian Revolution was no accident, but a planned and orchestrated attempt to support a regime change that would put them closer to achieving their goal of installing Islam at the center of the country's political agenda. Armbrust (834-864) suggested in his paper that the collapse of the Mubarak regime during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 may not have been directly caused by the Muslim Brotherhood, but their participation was a calculated one, as evidenced by their opportunistic actions during the conflict. In another study that was published in the Middle East Report, El-Ghobashy (2-13) suggested that the Egyptian Revolution was supposed to be a political exercise that should have brought back the value of the people in real politics‚Äîto reaffirm their power in choosing their leader. However, as El-Ghobashy (2-13) noted, it did not turn out to be that way, because of the many opportunistic groups and forces that took advantage of the weakened government and revolutionary forces to further their interests and aspirations for Egypt and the region. This set of actions perfectly describe what the Muslim Brotherhood did during the Egyptian Revolution. The bottom line is that the outcome of the revolution should have benefited the Egyptian people more, had the Islamist groups not intervened. As the number of protesters increased, it overwhelmed the police. They were forced to retreat from several parts of Cairo, eventually losing their grip on the country. This was mostly due to the panic among police officers during the jailbreaks and the riots. Police brutality and the excessive use of force against demonstrators also contributed to the Interior Ministry's withdrawal. Simultaneously, the government deployed the army in response to increasing lawlessness that day. The military, however, decided to remain neutral during the uprising despite a heavy presence of troops on the streets, especially in Cairo and Suez. Relevant History of the Brotherhood The Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is a multinational organization that represents the Sunni Islamic community and its interests. MB was founded in Egypt by a person named Hassan Al-Banna in 1928. Al-Banna was a schoolteacher who devoted a large portion of his life as an Islamic scholar. What separated Al-Banna from other Islamic scholars was his idealism. This can be evidenced by how easy Al-Banna's teachings about Sunni Islamism and how it should be propagated and embraced beyond the jurisdiction of the country where it was founded, even after his death. It can be recalled that the Muslim Brotherhood was founded at a time when Egypt was under the colonial rule and control of the United Kingdom. In order to allow the organization to grow, its leaders painted it (both with words and actions) as a simple religious organization that supports civic and social causes. This explains why the MB has been involved in a numerous community and nation-building programs for a significant part of its history. More specific examples of said programs include, but may not be limited to, the establishment of hospitals, and initiating education and livelihood programs. It became clear later on that one of the Muslim Brotherhood's ultimate goals was to put to an end the British influence over and control of Egypt. In hindsight, it is clear that the Muslim Brotherhood was, in fact, able to accomplish that objective, as evidenced by the establishment of the Republic of Egypt in 1952, following a coup de tat against the Egyptian monarchy, and which led to the elimination of all British military presence in the country. This is still a hotly debated issue, because the formal declaration of Egypt's independence from the British Empire occurred in 1922 (Migiro 1). The Muslim Brotherhood was established in 1928, and one of the reasons behind its formation was the continued influence of the British Empire on Egyptian politics, even after it has already declared its independence. This is something that the MB did not like. Following the real breakaway of Egypt from British colonialism in 1952 (a success for MB), the organization had to focus on a new political goal. That goal was the establishment of an Egyptian government ruled by Sharia law (Ghattas 1). In the wake of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the Muslim Brotherhood had been vocal about its support of the overthrow of then longtime president Hosni Mubarak, in favor of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, which was eventually replaced by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (Supreme Commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces). Considering the information that has been gathered about the Muslim Brotherhood's origins and its long-term goals in Egypt and in the region (Middle East and North African region), the idea that the Egyptian revolution was not a spontaneous civil demonstration but a well-planned and orchestrated move to change Egypt's political structure, in line of course of the Muslim Brotherhood's long-term plan to install a Sunni Islamist government in Egypt. =SCAF regime= After Hosni Mubarak's resignation on the night of 11 February 2011, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) under Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi assumed control of the country. This period was marked by major protests calling for the end of military rule and multiple tragedies, the worst being the Port Said stadium disaster. Despite the turbulence of the transitional period in Egypt, polls have shown that the SCAF has enjoyed wide legitimacy from the Egyptian people and general confidence in their ability to provide free elections. A poll in October 2011 showed that 91.7% of Egyptians have confidence in the SCAF to provide the conditions for free elections. The SCAF at that time had a general approval rating of 40.6%. The parliamentary elections were held in the end of 2011 and was accepted widely as one of the very rare free and fair elections in modern Egyptian history. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) took 44% of the seats and the \\"salafist\\" Al-Noor Party took 25% of the seats, thus providing an \\"islamist\\" domination of more than 69% of the parliament. =Presidency of Mohamed Morsi= In June 2012, presidential elections were held and Mohamed Morsi allegedly won 51.7% of the vote versus 48.3% for Ahmed Shafik. President Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), resigned from both organizations and took office on 30 June 2012. This marked the end of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces transition period. Of note is that on 14 June 2012, just 2 days before the second round of the presidential elections, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, who was not changed since appointment by the Mubarak regime, issued a judgement to dissolve the parliament that was elected after the revolution and ruled that the army-backed candidate could stay in the race, in what was widely seen as a double blow for the Muslim Brotherhood. The SCAF implemented this decision on 16 June 2012 and forbid members by force from entering the parliamentary building. The SCAF also produced a \\"constitutional declaration\\" that gave the army officials, who were also not changed since the Mubarak regime exclusive political powers. These actions were denounced as a coup by opposition leaders of all kinds and many within the Brotherhood, who feared that they will lose much of the political ground they have gained since Hosni Mubarak was ousted 16 months before. On 22 November 2012, after granting himself the powers to \\"protect\\" the constitution-writing committee from dissolution by the court, and the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts until a new parliament is elected, Mohamed Morsi followed his decrees by making an effort to push through a referendum on an Islamist-supported draft constitution, that was drafted by the constitution-writing committee that was elected by the post-revolution parliament. The move had been criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei who stated \\"Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh\\" on his Twitter feed. The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout the country. =Mass protests and coup d'√©tat= A youth group known as Tamarod, claimed to have collected millions of signatures calling for Morsi to step down. By 30 June, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, thousands of protesters surrounding the presidential palace in the Heliopolis suburb demanding the resignation of Morsi. A military source claimed that the number of protestors reached as many as 33 million, however, independent observers have raised concerns about wild exaggeration of the number of actual anti-Morsi protestors with one crowd statistical expert study indicating that a total of a little more than 1 million people protested against Morsi across the whole country. On 3 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces, headed by Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, acted on its 48-hour ultimatum by carrying out a coup d'√©tat ousting President Mohamed Morsi, suspending the constitution, appointing the head of the constitutional court as interim national leader, and calling for early elections. =Post-coup unrest= Violent clashes erupted in the aftermath of the coup d'√©tat following the 3 July 2013 removal of President Mohamed Morsi by the military amid demonstrations for and against Morsi's rule. Prior to the anti-government protests, many pro-Morsi protesters amassed near the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque, originally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Morsi's inauguration, but in the wake of the military coup, their message then changed to call for Morsi's return to power and condemn the military. Deadly clashes erupted on several days, including the killing of 61 protestors by the military at the Republican Guard headquarters on 8 July 2013 and a separate incident on 27 July 2013 in which over 100 protesters were killed by security forces. Both incidents were described by the Muslim Brotherhood as \\"massacres perpetrated by security forces.\\" On 14 August 2013, security forces raided the sit-ins at Rabaa and Nahda, resulting in a massacre of at least 904 pro-Morsi demonstrators. Human Rights Watch described the event as crimes against humanity and the military appointed interim government declared a month-long nighttime curfew which was extended a further two months. On 24 March 2014, an Egyptian court sentenced 529 suspected members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death accused of attacking a police station. By 2017, approximately 60,000 political prisoners according to independent counts and human rights groups have been imprisoned since the coup.A coronation flop: President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi fails to bring enough voters to the ballot box, economist.com.\\"Egypt sentences to death 529 supporters of Mohamed Morsi\\". The Guardian. 24 March 2014. Egypt Post Revolution It is still debatable whether the toppling of Mubarak's regime was good for Egypt or not. What is clear, however, is that it has led to a beginning of a new chapter in the country's history, one that is marked by revolutionary restructuring of its political and social order (Sowners and Toensing 1-320). The Muslim Brotherhood's participation in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 was instrumental, as it led to the resurgence of Islamism in Egyptian politics, and by extension, the Egyptian experience. It is worth mentioning that this outcome was all too predictable, because the Muslim Brotherhood had already been gaining a lot of influence not only as an organization but also as an ideological movement, even before the toppling of Mubarak's regime. In Guirguis' (187-226) paper, he also described how the Muslim Brotherhood took advantage of Mubarak's regime's collapse in order to further its goal of installing a new government based on the Sharia law. On the positive side, the post-Mubarak Egypt has led to positive developments, including but may not be limited to the rise of political parties‚Äîenabling the creation of further checks and balances against authoritarianism, trade and economic liberalization, and the establishment of independent social groups and unions, all of which lead to a more robust and dynamic democratic society (Joya 367-386). The market-friendly policies of the Muslim Brotherhood and its leaders made it very popular among the people of Egypt. The organization has long been known for their policies that support the development of free markets, and the liberalization of Egypt's rather obsolete trade and economic policies. The only problem that remains in Egypt's post-Mubarak era is who (or rather what organization) should be given the authority to control the government and lead its people towards prosperity and freedom. In Selim's (177-199) paper, he argued that there are currently three camps that are vying for that position, in what he refers to as the Triangle of Counter-Revolution. These three camps are represented by the Muslim Brotherhood, The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), and the United States. Selim (177-199) suggested that these three camps are currently engaged in a counter- revolutionary conflict against each other in Egypt, a development that prevents the nation from moving on from the Egyptian Revolution. = Election of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi = General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who led the military coup against President Mohamed Morsi emerged as a popular figure by his supporters in Egypt, and he eventually declared his candidacy for president in the 2014 elections. According to results from the Egyptian elections authority, he won 96.9% of the vote, however these results were denounced by observers as being a sham election similar to numbers reported for Hosni Mubarak in periodic elections and referendums during his reign as president. Nonetheless, el-Sisi's election was widely recognized internationally. Impact =Sinai insurgency= An increase in militant activity by Islamists initiating as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian revolution drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government in mid-2011 known as Operation Eagle. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area have continued by mid-2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed Operation Sinai. =Nationwide insurgency= There is a new wave of terrorism since the 2013 transition. =Deaths= At least 7,000 people have died during the crisis covered by this article (2011 to 2014) and the ensuing still ongoing insurgencies. *2011 revolution: 846 *Transition: 300+ *Sinai insurgency: 1,627 *2012‚Äì2013 Egyptian protests: 127+ *Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013‚Äì2014): 3,143+ *Insurgency in Egypt (2013‚Äìpresent): 570+ =Economy= Egyptian economy is still suffering from a severe downturn following the 2011 revolution and the government faces numerous challenges as to how to restore growth, market and investor confidence.

Life The author of the Vita Liutbergae was a monk of Halberstadt who claimed to have been a personal acquaintance, though the surviving manuscript evidence is late. Liutberga was first noticed for her talent and intelligence by Gisla. Gisla, eldest daughter of the Saxon count, Hesse, was the widow of Unwan. She had a young son. and had to travel a great deal to supervise his estates and her own. She must have had some previous knowledge of Liutberga‚Äôs potential for she removed the young woman from a convent and trained her to be her assistant. Liutberga was initially from Salzburg. Gisla took her into her home and raised her as a daughter,Pertz G. H. Medieval Sourcebook: The Life of St. Liutberga, 9th Century, trans. Jo Ann McNamara. as Gisla told her son Bernhard on her deathbed. Because Gisla funded churches and conducted business in many places, Liutberga travelled with her. Throughout their travels Liutberga was honest, wise, a hard worker, generous in almsgiving, pious and cared for the sick and the dying. Skilled in those diverse arts that pertain to woman's work, and so merciful she was called mother of the poor. During the day Liutberga oversaw her patroness‚Äôs household and estates, while at night she retired to pray. Upon her death, Gisla left her inheritance to her son Bernhard, urging him to help restore the church, care for his sisters, and care for Liutberga like a sister. Liutberga lived for a while with Bernhard and cared for his home and family, but she always found time to attend church and she kept vigils all night. When she grew old she was allowed to retire to the convent of Wendhausen, which had been founded by one of Gisla's widowed daughters. Even there she received many aristocratic visitors from the surrounding area as they wanted her advice and brought their daughters to learn some of her specialised domestic skills. Her career was in fact that of ‚Äòa professional housekeeper and teacher of domestic science‚Äô. She fasted, prayed and helped anyone who came to her in need. Abbots and Bishops took notice and respected her virtues and trusted her to train young women in religion as well as sewing and textile work. She is also said to have had the ability to accurately predict the future. She died around the year 870, an extremely religious and well-respected woman and was given an honored burial in the church.

Licenses are issued in administrative, supervisory, student service, and teaching areas. Teaching areas encompass birth through kindergarten, elementary (K-6), middle grades (6-9), secondary grades (9-12), special subjects (K-12), exceptional children (K-12), and vocational education. The standard basis for license is the completion of a National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) approved education program at an accredited college or university (See North Carolina NCATE accredited programs below). History =1845-1877= North Carolina first made an effort to hire qualified teachers in 1845. This act required school committees to \\"contract with a suitable teacher for their respective district, with strict regard to be had to the qualification and moral character of said teacher.\\" Bulletin 1916, p. 19. In 1847, the law was made more precise, and a committee of examination was created to appraise the adequacy of the teachers in the common schools. The provision stated, \\"the board of superintendents are authorized and empowered to appoint a committee of examination, consisting of not more than five persons, whose duty it shall be to examine into the qualifications, both mental and moral, of all such persons as may apply for employment as teachers in any of the common schools in their respective counties. No person shall be employed as a teacher in any of the common schools in any county of the State in which an examining committee is appointed, unless he obtain from a majority of the committee of examination for the county in which he seeks employment a certificate of his good moral character and sufficient mental qualifications as such teacher.\\"Bulletin 1916, p. 20. In 1852, the law was amended, establishing a committee of no more than five persons, with whom the chairman of the board is established. The amended act also stated, \\"no certificate issued to a teacher shall be good for a term for more than one year, and shall not be good for any county other than the county that issued the certificate.\\" A new administrative position was created in 1872, giving title to the new \\"County Examiner.\\" The position duties involved, \\"the County Examiner of each county shall examine all applicants for teachers' certificates at the courthouse of each county on the first Thursday of January and July of every year, and continue the examination from day to day during the remainder of the week, if necessary, till all applicants are examined. He shall grant certificates to all applicants of sufficient moral and mental qualification. If any person shall apply for an examination and certificate at any other time, the applicant shall pay the Examiner a fee of one dollar. If the County Examiner shall become satisfied that any person to whom a teacher's certificate has been granted is guilty of any immoral or disreputable conduct, he shall revoke the certificate and give notice to the secretary of the County Board of Education.\\" =1877-1897= In 1877, each county was required to provide for a \\"County Examiner\\", who was appointed by the County Board of Education. \\"The County Examiner of each county shall examine all applicants for teachers' certificates at the courthouse of the county on the second Thursday of August and October of every year, and continue the examination from day to day during the remainder of the week, if necessary, till all applicants are examined. He shall grant certificates to all applicants of sufficient moral and mental qualifications, and shall give certificates in three grades, as follows: If applicants are qualified to teach classes in the higher branches of English, they shall receive certificates of the first grade; if qualified to teach only in the ordinary branches of English, they shall be given a certificate of the second grade; and all applicants qualified to teach primary classes, only, shall be given certificates of the third grade.\\" Bulletin 1916, p. 22. A revision of the 1872 and 1877 laws was made in 1881. The 1881, \\"A Revisions of the Public School Laws Act\\" created the position of \\"County Superintendent of Public Instruction\\" who was to hold the examination for teachers' certificates. The grade of the certificate given was changed to be based upon a \\"per centum\\" grade. The County Superintendent of Public Instruction of each county shall examine all worthy applicants. The grade of the certificate to which the applicant may be entitled shall conform to the following standard of excellence: that is, one hundred being the maximum, a certificate shall not be issued to any applicant who makes less than fifty per centum in any one branch, or whose general average is less than seventy per centum. A general average of ninety per centum and over shall entitle an applicant to a first- grade certificate; a general average of eighty per centum or more shall entitle the applicant to a second-grade certificate; and a general average of seventy per centum or more shall entitle an applicant to a third-grade certificate; but a third-grade certificate may be issued if the applicant is proficient in spelling, reading, writing, and the four fundamental rules of arithmetic. The certificates shall be valid for one year from their dates and only in the county in which they are issued.\\" Bulletin 1916, p. 23. Changes were made in 1889 with an, \\"Act to Amend Public School Laws.\\" The act stated, \\"Partial third-grade certificates are hereby abolished. The conductor of any county institute, acting with the County Superintendent, may hold examinations and grant first-grade certificates, which shall be signed by both and shall be valid for three years. Such certificates may be made valid in any county by endorsement of the Superintendent thereof. That in addition to the requirement for obtaining a first-grade certificate, the applicant must, after one year from the ratification of this act, stand a satisfactory examination upon some books on school economy and theory and practice of teaching, to be selected by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\\" Bulletin 1916, p. 24. In 1893 the first law was passed which recognized a teacher's life certificate. This life certificate was given to those who had graduated from Peabody Normal College in Nashville, TN. \\"That the graduates from Peabody Normal College, Nashville, Tennessee, in the degree of Licentiate of Instruction, and any higher degrees conferred by said institution, shall be recognized in this State as certified for life as teachers in any and all public schools. That this privilege is subject to revocation by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, or by the State Board of Education, at his or their discretion, for cause.\\" In 1897, a new board, the Board of Examiners was created to conduct examinations. It composed of three professional teachers to be appointed by the State Board of Education, with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction serving as the chairman. \\"The State Board of Education shall appoint biennially a State Board of Examiners, who shall consist of three professional teachers, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall be ex officio chairman of the said board. The State Board of School Examiners shall have power to grant first-grade life certificates, which may be used in any county in the State, and shall furnish to the public, at least one month before the examination full information as to the nature and character of the requirements for such first-grade life certificates.\\" Bulletin 1916, p. 25. Another change was adopted in 1897, permanent teachers' certificates were granted to applicants who passed the required examination, provided that applicants show that every five years that they had been and still were teaching. \\"Provided, that every first-grade life certificate, to continue valid and operative, shall be renewed by the State Board of School Examiners every five years, and before said board shall renew said certificate it shall be accompanied with an affidavit of the teacher holding said certificate that he or she has been actually engaged in teaching school since receiving said certificate, or since its last renewal; and no charge shall be made for such renewal.\\" =1897-1915= \\"An Act to Revise and Consolidate the Public School Law of 1901\\" provides that the minimum age of persons to whom certificates shall be issued shall be eighteen years. Other provisions are that no third-grade certificate shall be renewed and no holder of a third- grade certificate shall be employed except as an assistant teacher.Bulletin 1916, p. 26. During the same year an act was passed repealing the law granting graduates or students of institutions of learning certificates to teach. The law states, \\"That all laws and clauses of laws granting to, or conferring upon, the graduates or ex-students or students of any institution of learning, private or public, within the State or elsewhere, immunity, exemption, or freedom from the operation of laws of this State requiring persons who desire to teach in free public schools of the State to submit to and pass regular examinations before the County Superintendents of Education before being duly qualified to serve as such teachers, be and the same are hereby repealed.\\"Bulletin 1916, p. 27. During the legislative session of 1905 a law was passed empowering the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, at his discretion, to provide for a uniform system of gradation, examination, and certification of teachers. \\"The State Superintendent of Public Instruction may, in his discretion, provide for a uniform system of gradation, examination and certification of public school teachers, prescribing the examination, the time and manner of conducting the same, and also for making provision for the classification of teachers' certificates into primary, intermediate, and high school.\\" In 1907 an act was passed providing for a first-grade State certificate for teachers, to be valid for a period of 5 years. This law provides: \\"In addition to the three grades of certificates herein provided, a certificate known as State certificate, signed by the State Superintendent and Board of Examiners hereinafter provided, shall be issued to any person who upon examination by said Board of Examiners shall make a general average of not less than ninety per cent.\\" Other requirements included, \\"That no person shall be permitted to stand such examination without first filing with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction a statement from the County Superintendent of Public Instruction of the county in which said applicant last taught that said applicant holds a first-grade certificate and has taught successfully at least one year.\\" This first-grade State certificate was to be valid in any county in the State, and no other examination or certificate as a prerequisite for teaching a public school shall be required of any person holding the State certificate for a period of five years from the date of issue of said State certificate. New laws of 1915 were more liberal than the previous one. Greater consideration was given to the teacher, offering a greater inducement to the teacher who had received professional and academic training at a higher institution of learning. The teacher who was given a first-grade State certificate for five years was, previously, required to make an average marking of ninety per cent; the new law requires the applicant to make only seventy-five per cent to secure this certificate. The more important and significant provision of the new law was, \\"that the Board of Examiners may, in their discretion, and in lieu of examination, allow certain credits for academic and professional work done in approved institutions and for successful experience; and said high school teacher's certificate shall be subject to renewal and may, in the discretion of the Board of Examiners, on its second renewal be converted into a life certificate.\\"Bulletin 1916, p. 28.

He was also the president of the Asiatic Society of Bombay from 1835 to 1842; and was elected Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland in 1870. Early life and studies John Wilson was born in Lauder on 11 December 1804, the eldest of four brothers and three sisters, and grew up in a farming family. His father, Andrew Wilson, who lived to the age of eighty-two, was a councillor of the burgh for over forty years and represented the parish church as an elder. John's mother, Janet Hunter, was the oldest of thirteen children; she had a strong character and also lived to the age of eighty-two. The family grew up in Lauder on a hill farm sprawled across seventeen hundred acres. As a child Wilson revealed that he was more intelligent than his siblings, learning to walk and talk at an early age. In school he was considered 'the priest' on the playground because was often seen preaching to his classmates. His being advanced for his age sometimes caused him trouble, and his preaching was sometimes seen as an offence. When Wilson was four, he started at a school in Lauder, taught by a George Murray. He was only there for a year before he was moved to a parish school to be taught by Alexander Paterson. He left school at the age of fourteen, the standard end of school in Scotland in the 19th century. His progress was also in his spiritual life. Mr. Paterson affected not only his students' spiritually but also the community. From 1819 he attended the University of Edinburgh, where he studied linguistics, philosophy and theology for eight years, and also mastered the languages of Gujarati, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Arabic and Zend. As he continued in his studies he discovered that teaching was a calling for him, and started to study in that field. He graduated from the University in 1828. Wilson's first experience of teaching was as a guide and tutor to the three boys of Colonel Rose Cormack. As he guided them through the Netherlands he tutored them. These young men went on to be successful, one becoming Sir John Rose Cormack, a physician in Paris. After touring for four years with the Cormack boys and studying at the University of Edinburgh during the same period he decided to dedicate his life to the people of India, specifically the people of Bombay in the education field. Educational mission Wilson College, Mumbai, established 1832. Rev. Dr John Wilson dressing for an early photograph by David Octavius Hill & Robert Adamson In 1829, a year after his graduation, Wilson and his wife went to Bombay as Christian missionaries supported by the Church of Scotland. The couple first studied Marathi at Harnai; then in 1831 they moved back to Bombay, where John established the Ambroli Church for the people. Determined to set up educational institutions for the young in Bombay, John first established an English school in 1832, and added a college in 1836 ‚Äì now called Wilson College, Mumbai. With this School John was able to introduce European education, examinations and textbooks to the people of the city. This would gradually change the way in which schools in Bombay orchestrated themselves. In 1857 John helped to establish the Bombay University, and went on to become its Vice-Chancellor in 1869. Wilson's wife, Margaret, also influenced the education system in Bombay, and aided the female population by establishing schools for girls in 1829. In 1832 she established a boarding school for females, now called St. Columbia High School. This was western India's first boarding school for females. The couple also opened schools in Marathi and Hebrew for the Native Jewish community of the Bene Israel of the Konkan region, teaching Boys as well as girls and translating the Holy Bible especially the Old Testament for their benefit. Wilson was a passionate advocate for the preservation of Indian historical monuments. He was the Honorary President of what was then the Asiatic Society of Bombay. When the Bombay Cave Temple Commission was established in 1848, he was elected the first president. He was an important lobbyist for the establishment in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India.Gordon, 231‚Äì234 Family In 1828 Wilson married Margaret Bayne (died 1835), daughter of the Rev Kenneth Bayne of Greenock. Following Margaret's death her sisters, Anna and Hay Bayne, joined Wilson in India as housekeepers and companions.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church In 1846 he married Isabella Dennistoun. She died in 1867 and he was then joined in India by her niece, Miss Taylor. His eldest son Andrew Wilson (1831‚Äì9.6.1881) was author of \\"The Abode of Snow\\". Writings Wilson was the author of many books. Early in his mission he started a periodical about religion, society, culture and European thought, called The Oriental Christian Spectator, which ran from 1830 to 1862. In 1838 he wrote A Memoir of Mrs. Margret Wilson, and in 1850 a Memoir of the Cave Temples and Monasteries and Ancient Remains in Western India. In 1858 he wrote, India Three Thousand Years Ago. As the years went on he wrote many books, including Parsi Religion (1843), Evangelisation of India (1849), History of the Suppression of Female Infanticide in Western India (1855), Aboriginal Tribes of The Bombay Presidency (1876) and Indian Caste (1877). As an archaeologist, Wilson wrote the 1847 Lands of the Bible: Visited and Described, the 1861 Caves of Karla (on the Karla Caves), and the 1875 Religious Excavations of Western India: Buddhist, Brahamanical and Jaina. He also published a small account about the origins of the Bene Israel Jewish community of the Konkan rigion in 1838.  References David, M. D. John Wilson and his Institution.

His main research included the evolution of flightless birds, the systematics of birds, and the ecology and behaviour of steamer ducks. Early life Livezey was born in Salem, Massachusetts. He grew up in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. His interest in birds started when he was in High School. Livezey earned a Bachelor of Science at Oregon State University in 1976. In 1979 he earned his first Master of Science degree at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in wildlife ecology and in 1984 his second in mathematics at the University of Kansas. In 1985 he completed a Ph.D. with his thesis Systematics and flightlessness of steamer-ducks (Anatidae: Tachyeres) at the University of Kansas. In 1993, he was hired as Associate Curator of Birds at Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh and was awarded full curatorship in 2001. During that time, he served as the museum's first Dean of Science. As Curator of Birds, he oversaw around 195,000 bird specimens, the ninth-largest bird collection in the United States. Research Livezey's research work dealt with controversial areas of bird phylogenetics and taxonomy. While Livezey's colleagues often used DNA analysis to support their research, Livezey demonstrated a more traditional approach, based on exhaustive studies of bone shape and other characteristics. His general interests included phylogenetic relationships of avian families, phylogenetic relationships of waterfowl, evolution of avian flightlessness, comparative osteology of birds, multivariate morphometrics, and avian paleontology. He was generally considered to be the world authority on the osteology‚Äîthe study of skeletons‚Äîof birds. Perhaps his greatest legacy is the Higher-Order Phylogeny of Modern Birds, co-authored over the course of 10 years with associate Richard L. Zusi of the Smithsonian Institution. This research opus analyzes 2,954 bird characters‚Äîtraits such as beak shape, relative wing proportions, and feather characteristics‚Äîto create the most comprehensive bird classification scheme known to science. Brad was also one of the first researchers to embrace the concept that birds shared their evolutionary lineage with dinosaurs.

The S√∂vestad Runestones consist of a Viking Age image stone and memorial runestone found near Krageholm Castle, which is about two kilometers west of S√∂vestad, Sk√•ne County, Sweden. S√∂vestad 1 S√∂vestad 1, which is listed as DR 290 in the Rundata catalog, consists of a depiction of a man holding a cross on a pole. There are no runes carved on this stone. The inscription on the granite stone, which is 1.65 meters in height, was discovered in 1756 on the castle grounds when the stone was turned over. The remains of a sword were also found under the stone. Both of the S√∂vestad 1 and 2 stones are today raised at the castle. Although located in Sweden, both of the S√∂vestad stones were given Danish Rundata designations because Scania was part of the historical Denmark. S√∂vestad 2 The S√∂vestad 2 stone. The inscription on S√∂vestad 2, which is listed as DR 291 in the Rundata catalog, consists of runic text in the younger futhark carved within a serpent that curves to make four text frames and within a separate inner text band. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp, which is the classification for inscriptions with text bands with serpent or beast heads depicted as seen from above. The granite stone, which is 1.5 meters in height, was discovered with the inscription side down in a grove near a lake on the castle grounds in 1757. The runic text indicates that the stone was raised as a memorial to a man named Bramr by his wife Tonna and son Asgotr. Bramr is described as being b√¶ztr bomanna or \\"best of estate-holders\\" and mildastr mata Ä or \\"most generous with food.\\" This description is consistent with generosity with food and feasting being a mark of power and renown in Viking Age Scandinavia. Several other runestones also note persons who are generous with food, including inscription U 739 in G√•di, which similar to DR 291 describes a man as mildr mata Ä or \\"generous with food,\\" Sm 37 in R√∂rbro which uses yndr mata Ä or \\"liberal with food,\\" and Sm 39 in Ryssby, Sm 44 in Ivla, S√∂ 130 in Hagstugan, U 703 in V√§ppeby, and U 805 in Fr√∂slunda, where men are described using a form of matar g√≥√∞an or \\"free with food.\\" p. 422. p. 230. =Inscription= Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters :√ó tuna √ó sati √ó stain √ó √æansi √ó afti Ä √ó bram √ó bunta : sin √ó auk √ó askutr √ó sun Ä √ó hans √ó han √ó ua Ä √ó bastr √ó bumana √ó auk √ó ¬∂ √ó miltastr √ó mata ÄProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk ‚Äì Rundata entry for DR 291.

The Delta Regional Authority serves 252 counties and parishes in parts of eight states: Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. Led by a Federal Co-Chairman appointed by the President and the governors of the eight states, the DRA fosters partnerships throughout the region as it works to improve the Delta economy. DRA funds can be used to leverage other federal and state programs. Under federal law, at least 75 percent of DRA funds must be invested in economically distressed counties and parishes. Half of DRA funds are awarded for transportation and basic infrastructure improvements. About The 1990 report of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission spurred efforts to direct federal economic assistance toward the Lower Mississippi River Valley region. The region, as defined in the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Act of 1988, consisted of 219 counties in Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois and was the poorest in the United States, with a poverty rate of 22% compared to a national rate of 12%. In 1998, President Bill Clinton, an Arkansas native, proposed channeling $26 million in federal aid to the region through the Appalachian Regional Commission, but Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice opposed the plan, fearing it would divert aid from the Appalachian Region, including several counties in northern Mississippi. Instead, Congress funneled the allocation through the Department of Agriculture, but the Department said it was unable to comply with Congress' intent without more specific direction. In 1999, Arkansas Democrats Senator Blanche Lincoln and Representative Marion Berry introduced the Delta Regional Authority Act of 1999HR.2911 and S.1622, neither of which became law. to create the Delta Regional Authority to administer funds allocated to the region. The legislation was co-sponsored by Arkansas Republican Senator Tim Hutchinson, Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Frist, and Tennessee Democratic Representative Harold Ford, Jr.. Clinton announced in December 1999 that he would include $30 million in funding for the Authority in his next budget proposal. Mississippi Republican Senator Thad Cochran become the leading voice against the legislation, opining that the money should be channeled to the Delta Region through existing agencies such as colleges and universities. thumbThe DRA footprint includes 252 counties and parishes across 8 states. Since 2002, DRA has invested in 934 projects represented by the blue and yellow dots with yellow representing FY 2015 projects. Source: dra.gov/sedap In 2000, Congress established the Delta Regional Authority to enhance economic development and improve the quality of life for the residents of the Lower Mississippi River Delta region. The Delta Regional Authority is a regional economic development agency serving 252 counties and parishes in the following eight states: *Alabama *Arkansas *Illinois *Kentucky *Louisiana *Mississippi *Missouri *Tennessee The DRA is led by two presidential appointees, Federal Co-Chairman (FCC) and Alternate Federal Co-Chairman (AFCC), along with a State Co-Chairman and the governor of each participating state, the Delta Regional Authority is designed to remedy severe and chronic economic distress by stimulating economic development and fostering partnerships that will have a positive impact on the region‚Äôs economy. Mission The Delta Regional Authority helps economically distressed communities to leverage other federal and state programs in the four Congressionally mandated priority funding categories: * Basic public infrastructure in distressed counties and isolated areas of distress; * Transportation infrastructure for the purpose of facilitating economic development in the region; * Business development, with emphasis on entrepreneurship; and * Workforce development or employment-related education, with emphasis on use of existing public educational institutions located in the region. Outcomes Since the inception of the DRA Federal Funding Program, known as the States' Economic Development Assistance Program since 2010, the following projected outcomes have been documented: * 11,452 jobs have been created; * 14,766 jobs have been retained; * 64,831 families have received improved water and sewer; and * 7,202 individuals have been trained for jobs. Impact DRA has contributed $138,358,642 to 934 projects in its eight-state region towards a total investment in those projects of $890,612,847. * DRA total project investment includes an additional leverage of $752,254,205 in other federal, state and local funds, which is a ratio of 5.44 to 1. * In addition, private funds invested in these projects total $2,208,673,037, which is a ratio of 15.96 to 1, private dollars to DRA dollars. * Total leveraged investment of $2,960,927,242 including federal, state, local and private funds produced a ratio of 21.4 to 1. Partnerships At the local level, the Delta Regional Authority coordinates efforts with a combination of agencies. Assisting the Delta Regional Authority are local development districts (\\"LDDs\\"), regional entities with a proven track record of helping municipalities, counties and parishes improve basic infrastructure and stimulate growth. DRA partners with USDA's Rural Development (RDA) Program. Through their network of state and local offices, the RDA assists the Delta Regional Authority with the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) program. DRA also partnered with the Economic Development Association (EDA) by conducting community evaluations related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Additionally, the Delta Regional Authority works with each member state's Department of Economic Development, local development districts, Departments of Transportation, governor‚Äôs offices, Department of Health, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, congressional offices and city and county government. Programs and initiatives The Delta Regional Authority is involved in numerous efforts to improve the lives of the people it serves. The following programs are currently under operation throughout the Authority's region: * DRA Growing a Health Workforce in the Delta Initiative (HDI); * Delta Doctors Program (DDP); * BF Smith Foundation ‚Äì Adult Literacy/Workforce Training (BFS); * Information Technology/iDelta (IT); * Delta Development Highway System (DDHS); * Multi-Modal Transportation (MMT); * Delta Green Jobs Initiative (DGJI); * Innovative Readiness Training Program (IRT); * Local Development District (LDD); * Entrepreneurship Training (SIU); * Delta Leadership Institute (DLI).

Giannini. This fund has now grown to $20 million that is used to promote and support research on the economics of California agriculture. Members, which include faculty from various University of California campuses, may apply for grants to conduct research on California's agricultural economy and development. The findings are often reported in numerous publications. Origin of the Foundation Amadeo Peter Giannini, or A.P. as he was known, established the Bank of Italy in 1904 in the North Beach district of San Francisco. He initially made his money as a commission merchant and produce dealer for farms in the Santa Clara Valley, but found banks uninterested in being in business with farms, so he decided to open his own bank. The business continued to grow and more branches were opened in the Central Valley. Giannini sought out customers in agriculture, with a focus on expanding the horticulture industry and small farmers. The bank became extremely profitable in the 1920s prior to the Great Depression. While President of the Bancitaly Corporation, Giannini never received a salary or other compensation.James, M., and B.R. James. Biography of a Bank: The Story of Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. New York NY: Harper and Brothers, 1954. In 1926, Bancitaly‚Äôs directors voted to reimburse Giannini with 5% of the corporation‚Äôs annual net profits, a figure of $1.5 million. However, he refused to accept the money and asked that it be donated to help California‚Äôs farmers.Bonadio, F.A. A.P. Giannini: Banker of America, Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1994. Thus, on February 14, 1928, the Bancitaly Corporation presented a gift of $1.5 million to the Regents of the University of California.Johnston, W.E. and A.F. McCalla. A.P.

The Activities of the Foundation Members of the foundation include faculty and Cooperative Extension specialists in agricultural and resource economics at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Riverside. The Foundation focuses on research in the realm of agriculture and rural development in California. Members and associate members of the Foundation may apply competitively to receive funding for their research. Publications Foundation members and graduate students publish widely on topics relevant to California agriculture. Though much of this research appears in leading peer reviewed journals, the Foundation has its own publication series: *ARE Update- the bimonthly newsletter is published to print topical papers written by members of the Foundation. *Giannini Reporter- provides information on the ongoing research of the Foundation, the extension of that research, and other related activities. *Research Report Series- designed to communicate research results to specific professional audiences interested in applications. *Monograph Series- provides an outlet for reports of research appraised by criteria equivalent to those of leading technical journals in agricultural economics. *Information Series- communicates selected research to a lay audience. *Special Report Series- an outlet for papers worthy of publication, yet not belonging in a regular series. In honor of the 75th anniversary of A.P.'s gift to the University of California, two emeritus members, Warren Johnston and Alex McCalla, published a book entitled \\"A.P. Giannini and the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,\\" which includes paper and panel discussion of the 75th Symposium, annals of the Giannini Foundation, and archival materials of California's agricultural economics. Libraries The Giannini Foundation supports the agricultural and resource economics libraries that are found on the Davis and Berkeley campuses.

He has also designed a number of churches in Copenhagen. He was Royal Building Inspector from 1911 to 1938. Early life and education Thorval J√∏rgen was born in Norsminde outside Aarhus, Denmark. He completed a carpenter's apprenticeship in Aarhus in 1885 and then moved to Copenhagen where he was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts the same year, where he was taught by Hans J√∏rgen Holm, Martin Nyrop, Ferdinand Meldahl and Albert Jensen. He graduated in 1889, won the Academy's large gold medal in 1893 for A church with rectory, and then worked for Hans J√∏rgen Holm on the Overformynderiet institution building in Copenhagen from 1892 to 1893. In 1892 he received the Academy's scholarship and over the next years travelled widely in Europe, particularly in Italy. Career From the turn of the century, he designed a number of churches in and around Copenhagen. His design of Brorson's Church was rewarded with the Eckersberg Medal. In 1905 he won the competition for the design of the new Christiansborg Palace after Christian Frederik Hansen's previous Christiansborg Palace had been destroyed in a fire. Construction started the next year but before the building was completed in 1928 after a prolonged and difficult political process, the design had changed considerable from J√∏rgensen's original winning proposal. It was met with strong criticism. In 1911 J√∏rgensen was appointed Royal Building Inspector. The rest of his works work mainly included churches and public buildings but also a number of villas and country houses. Style With influence from his teachers from the Academy, Holm and Nyrop, J√∏rgen belonged to the Herholdt-Holmske group of Danish Historicist architects which relied on Medieval Danish architecture for inspiration, rather than Ferdinand Meldahl's more internationally inclined followers. Later he turned to Neo-Baroque (Christiansborg Palace) and Neoclassicism (Gentofte Town Hall). Hellerup Church shows influence from Art Nouveau (Jugendstil).

The workers, many of whom were of Irish descent, were unsettled by the discovery and wanted to create a memorial to ensure the grave, which held the coffins of 6,000 Irish immigrants, would not be forgotten. Erected on December 1, 1859, the stone was the first Canadian monument to represent the famine.

While some prisons prepare their own food, many use staff from on-site catering companies. Some prisons support the dietary requirements of specific religions, as well as vegetarianism.Do Prison Inmates Have a Right to Vegetarian Meals?. Vegetarian Journal Mar/Apr 2001. Retrieved 19 August 2015. Prisoners will typically receive a series of standard meals per day from the prison, but in many prisons they can supplement their diets by purchasing additional foods, including snacks and desserts, at the prison commissary with money earned from working in the prison or sent by family and friends. Around the world =North America= United States Inmates' kitchen at the farm of the Federal McNeil Island Corrections Center in Puget Sound, April 6, 1938. 1946 Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary menu Typical menus are designed to be low-sugar, low-salt, and to contain a moderate amount of calories. Dietary, religious, and ethical concerns are taken into consideration to a certain extent. Supreme Court cases in 1987, Turner v. Safley and O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, created a test that balanced the constitutional rights of prisoners to exercise their religion freely against the rights of the prisons to punish inmates and keep the prison in order. Whether or not a prison has breached an inmate's religious dietary rights is now judged from the cases of Turner and O'Lone. While this test is still in use, many other constitutional points come into play, and it is still a widely debated issue. Most prison food in the United States is prepared with the blast-chill method, which allows a large number of meals to be prepared and then reheated at meal times. In the US, this technique was pioneered by the New Jersey correctional system, in January 1982. Inmates may also purchase food at the prison commissary, such as chocolate bars, beef jerky, honey, peanut butter, bread, ramen noodles, coffee, and snack cakes. Often, private civilian contractors are responsible for all aspects of food preparation, including training, adherence to recipes, food safety, theft prevention, and portion control. Jewish prisoners may be issued kosher rations.Are Clark County Jail meal requests kosher? That's one issue facility is facing as spike in special religious diets sends food costs soaring, 2013-01-20 As of October 2, 2016, federal prisons offer their inmates a vegan meal option for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.U.S. Prisons to Begin Offering Vegan Entr√©es in October 2016, 2016-09-26 Although there is a certain amount of self- regulation, most oversight occurs as a result of inmate litigation. Complaints against prison food have been made on the grounds of breach of Constitutional Amendments. In particular, claims of inadequate food may breach the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment, and denial of specific food requirements on religious grounds breach the First Amendment. It was not until 1976, during the Estelle v. Gamble case, that courts began to use the Eighth Amendment for issues involving cruel and unusual punishment against inmates; however, the issues must involve 1.) \\"Whether the injury was objectively, sufficiently serious,\\" and 2.) \\"Whether the prison official was deliberately indifferent to the inmate's needs.\\" This can be interpreted by different courts in various ways. For example, one court may see depriving a disobedient inmate of food as \\"sufficiently serious,\\" therefore going against the Eighth Amendment, while another court may see it as an appropriate measure of punishment, therefore in line with the Eighth Amendment. State prisons often prefer to conduct their own inspections; however, they may opt for accreditation from a nonprofit organization such as the American Correctional Association. Approximately 80% of state departments of corrections are involved with such oversight organizations. =Example of meals= An example of a meal from a state prison is as follows:Waite, Jennifer Prison Food: What Are America's Inmates Eating? *2‚Äì3 ounces of meat or meat byproduct *half a cup of vegetables *three-quarters of a cup of a starch *three-quarters of a cup of salad with dressing There is concern about the change of food preparation practices. There have been several documented examples of mass illness within prisons from the food served.Chris Hedges: Food Behind Bars Isn‚Äôt Fit for Your Dog - Chris Hedges - Truthdig There have been hunger strikes from prisoners protesting being served food that makes them ill after eating. Whistle blowers and reporters have documented mouse droppings and various violations of standards in prison kitchens. It is no longer allowed for family to bring food nor share with loved ones behind bars; rather families can transfer money for a fee to allow inmates to purchase packaged foods such as prepared noodle packages and candy from the prison store. There is thus usually no way for inmates to ever have access to fresh food. Aramark, who has provided the meals to many prisons in the USA since 2004, has been sharply criticized for lowering standards and not providing sufficient quantities of edible food. Prisoners have been known to create prison \\"spreads\\", or privately prepared meals with items purchased from a prison commissary, obtained from government-mandated meals to prisoners, or obtained from a prison kitchen. Spreads can often become communal gatherings of prisoners, with the general expectation that each prisoner contributes one aspect of the meal. Prison spreads are largely a response to inadequate food quality, quantity and/or variety within the meals served by the prison itself. =Europe= United Kingdom In jails in the late 1830s prisoners were issued a spoon, a 2-pint zinc dish for broth, and a 3-gill zinc bowl for milk. During winter, when milk was in short supply, prisoners would occasionally be provided with treacle water. Strict rules governed the quantity of food given to prisoners. For example, a female who was not in condition for work would receive around one and a half pints of broth and six ounces of bread. A male prisoner who was in condition for work would get two pints of broth and twelve ounces of bread. Breakfast, served at 7:30 am, would comprise 5 ounces of oatmeal porridge with 3/4 of a pint of milk. Lunch, served at 12:00 pm, consisted of soup and bread. Each pint of soup was required to contain one ounce of ox head or marrow bones, 1 1/2 ounces of barley, 1/2 ounces of green peas, 1 1/2 ounces of leeks, and various other vegetables. Supper was served at 6:00 pm, and consisted of 5 ounces of oatmeal porridge and 1/2 of a pint of milk.Life in Jail  Prison Life in the 1800s Up until about 2004 (in most prisons), prison meals were prepared by prisoners under the supervision of prison employees. The move towards privatization of meal preparation and rationing resulted in numerous changes from historical practices. In some prisons e.g. HMP Norwich, the prison meals are still prepared by prisoners. Current food The average daily allowance per prisoner is ¬£1.87, and can be as low as ¬£1.20. In some cases, particularly in juvenile institutions, allowances can be as high as ¬£3.45 per day. The total catering expenditure by the HM Prison Service in 2004‚Äì2005 was ¬£94 million, ¬£43 million of which was spent on food, and ¬£32 million was spent on catering staff. Some prisoners work in the kitchens, supervised by catering staff, and this is a popular prison job as it involves working at weekends and therefore attracts higher pay, as well as providing a chance to obtain some skills in cooking. Meals are generally not made from seasonal produce, but instead use convenience foods such as canned goods, frozen vegetables, hamburgers and pies.Serving Time: Prisoner Diet and Exercise Examples of meals Examples of menus in a London prison are as follows:British Prison Food: Today's Prison Meals Lunch: *Vegetarian pasta bake *Chicken & mushroom pie *Halal Jamaican beef patty *Corned beef & pickle roll *Jacket potato & coleslaw Dinner: *Vegetable supreme *Chicken supreme *Halal chicken curry *Grilled gammon *Pork pie salad =Africa= Egypt Regular meals served to prisoners are basic.

Studies show that most of the time death row inmates choose foods that are high in calories and fat such as french fries and hamburgers. In some US states, for example, Texas, last meals were limited to 20 dollars. However, in other states such as Florida and Indiana, last meals are limited to 40 dollars. California allows for up to 50 dollars to be spent on the last meal. Most states require that the last meal be locally available. If the meal exceeds these price limits they will either reduce the portions or make the inmate choose something else. For example, a Texas inmate who asked to be served 24 soft shell tacos was only given 4. It was also found that last meal requests reflected the inmates' nationality. *Nutraloaf ‚Äì Nutraloaf is given to prisoners who misbehave.Can prison food be unconstitutionally bad?Food?

The perpetrator, Ahmad Daqamseh, was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder by a Jordanian medical team. A five-member military tribunal subsequently sentenced him to 20 years in prison with hard labour. Shortly after the attack, King Hussein went to offer condolences to families of the victims; it was seen as a sincere and an unusual act in the history of the Israeli-Arab conflict, which deeply moved the mourning Israeli public and helped improve the relationship between the two countries after the attack. Daqamseh was later called a \\"hero\\" by Jordanian politician Hussein Mjalli, and a petition circulated in the Jordanian parliament in 2013 where MPs alleged that he had finished his sentence. Daqamseh was released on 12 March 2017 after completing his sentence. He expressed pride for his actions, and showed no signs of remorse.House majority call for release of ex-Jordanian soldier, Ammon News 04-04-2013 The attack Memorial to the victims in Naharayim, Israel On Thursday, March 13, 1997, 80 seventh- and eighth-grade schoolgirls from the Fuerst (F√ºrst) School of Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, were on a field trip to the Jordan Valley and the Golan Heights. Part of the trip was to Naharayim, visiting the \\"Island of Peace\\", a joint Israeli-Jordanian tourist resort under Jordanian rule. During the afternoon, the class reached the \\"Island of Peace\\" site and the girls got off the bus. As they were heading towards the observatory, a Jordanian soldier stationed at the site opened fire on the group with an M16 rifle. The perpetrator killed seven schoolgirls and wounded five others and a teacher before his rifle jammed, and Jordanian soldiers rushed to help the victims after seizing him while yelling \\"Madman! Madman!\\". = Fatalities = { * Sivan Fathi, 13, of Tzelafon * Karen Cohen, 14, of Beit Shemesh * Ya'ala Me'iri, 13, of Beit Shemesh * Shiri Badayev, 14, of Beit Shemesh  * Natali Alkalai, 13, of Beit Shemesh * Adi Malka, 13, of Beit Shemesh * Nirit Cohen, 13, of Beit Shemesh } =Memorial= The memorial site was founded by members of neighbouring kibbutz Ashdot Ya'akov. It shows 7 white small hills for every murdered girl with her name \\"written\\" by flowers. On a board a biblical quotation from is written: \\"And he will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaves will not wither.\\" The perpetrator The perpetrator was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who stated that he attacked because he was insulted and angered that the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying. He was born in 1968. Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, \\"I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased god and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.\\"  Aftermath  The attack carried a resemblance to an incident where an Israeli Army clerk fired on a group of Palestinians in the Hebron vegetable market on 1 January 1997, wounding seven. He too was found to be mentally unstable by the Israeli authorities. Other media outlets drew parallels with the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, where an Israeli Army reserve captain killed 29 and injured 125 in a Hebron mosque. There were reports from Amman that hundreds of Jordanian soldiers had lined up to donate blood at the hospital where the girls were taken. = Jordanian reaction = After Daqamseh was captured, the Jordanian army officially announced that Daqamseh was mentally ill. A specialized medical team diagnosed him with antisocial personality disorder. On March 16, 1997, a few days after the attack, King Hussein of Jordan personally apologized for the incident, traveling to Israel to visit and pay respects to the grieving families of the seven murdered girls during the traditional Jewish mourning ceremony known as shiva. King Hussein's visit to the parents of the victims was broadcast live in Israel and Jordan. During the visit, in which King Hussein stood alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he expressed an apology on behalf of the Kingdom of Jordan telling the parents, \\"Your daughter is like my daughter. Your loss is my loss.\\" He added that they were all \\"members of one family\\" and that the shooting was \\"a crime that is a shame for all of us... I feel as if I have lost a child of my own. If there is any purpose in life it will be to make sure that all the children no longer suffer the way our generation did.\\" Afterwards King Hussein also visited the wounded schoolgirls in the hospital, and offered to provide financial compensation to the families affected by the attack. King Hussein's sincere act was an unusual act in the history of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict which deeply moved the mourning Israeli public and helped improve the relationship between the two countries after the attack. Nevertheless, various Jordanian individuals and groups criticized King Hussein's act for prostrating himself before Israel. = Trial and conviction = While the majority of Jordanians disapproved of the attacks and expressed sympathy for the victims, Daqamseh became a hero to some Jordanians who opposed normalization with Israel. Police prevented a pilgrimage to his house, and 200 Jordanian lawyers led by the Jordanian Bar Association competed to represent him. In July 1997, a five-member Jordanian military tribunal found Daqamseh guilty of killing the Israeli schoolgirls and sentenced him to 20 years with hard labour in prison. He could have faced the death penalty but the tribunal spared him because he was determined to be mentally unstable. = Jordan‚Äôs justice minister's call for Daqamseh's release = On February 14, 2011, Jordan‚Äôs new justice minister Hussein Mjalli joined dozens of protesters in demanding the early release of Daqamseh. Mjalli, a long-time oppositionist, was appointed to the position as a result of the 2011 Jordanian protests, part of the larger Arab Spring against the region's established regimes. Mjalli previously served as the defense lawyer of Daqamseh in his 1997 trial. As an Arab nationalist opposed to the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, Mjalli views Daqamseh as a hero who should not be in prison. The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Mjalli‚Äôs comments were received in Israel with \\"revulsion and shock.\\" Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Merav Horsandi said it \\"is difficult for us to comprehend how there are people who support the release of a cold-blooded murderer of young children.\\" To allay Israeli concerns and anger regarding a possible early release, Jordan's foreign ministry issued a statement reassuring that Daqamseh would serve out his life sentence and that Mjalli had just expressed his personal opinion. = Jordanian parliament calls for Daqamseh's release = In April 2013, 110 of 120 Jordanian Members of Parliament signed a petition calling for the release of Daqamseh. The petition called for a special pardon to release him. The cause of the petition is that Daqamseh allegedly finished his sentence. The families of the seven murdered schoolgirls expressed outrage over the petition and vowed to do everything in their power to thwart Daqamseh's release. Nurit Fatihi, mother of Sivan Fatihi, said: \\"I expected [Daqamseh] to rot in jail, but I see I can‚Äôt count on the Jordanian court and authorities to promote justice. We‚Äôve addressed government officials in the past, but it didn‚Äôt really help... Just like I will never see my daughter again, so too he does not deserve to see his family. Every one of the girls would have a family and children by now.\\"Outraged Naharayim families to fight call for Jordanian murderer‚Äôs release, Times of Israel 13-04-2013 On April 15, 2013, during Yom Hazikaron, the families of the victims held a memorial service in front of the Jordanian embassy in Ramat Gan. At the end of the ceremony, the Jordanian ambassador, Walid Khalid Obeidat, invited the parents into the embassy, and assured them that Daqamesh would not be released at the time. Daqamseh's release On 12 March 2017, Daqamseh was released, after completing his prison term of 20 years. \\"We respect the Jordanian judiciary, and now we can only remember the image of King Hussein consoling the families of the victims,\\" commented Alice Wells, then American ambassador to Jordan, when asked about the embassy's opinion on Daqamseh's release.

She was launched on 23 July 1918. The U.S. Shipping Board took control of Argonne and renamed her SS Western Comet, then transferred her to the U.S. Navy on 22 September 1918 for use during World War I. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3569 and commissioned her the same day as USS Western Comet (ID-3569) with Lieutenant Commander Walter Tinn, USNRF, in command. Operational history Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Western Comet got underway on 2 October 1918 for New York City with a cargo of flour.

The coup was engineered by Republican general Claude Fran√ßois de Malet, who had spent time in prison because of his opposition to Napoleon. The coup failed, and the leading conspirators were executed.  The Malet conspiracy  Claude Fran√ßois de Malet was born in 1754, distinguishing himself in the French Revolutionary Wars and slowly becoming disenchanted with Napoleon Bonaparte, opposing the Corsican general's rise to the position of First Consul. Malet, by 1804 a brigadier general, resigned his commission after Napoleon was crowned Emperor of the French. After his resignation, Malet was made governor of Pavia, then of Rome, both of which were under French control. After Napoleon's stepson, Viceroy of Italy Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, accused Malet of conspiring against Napoleon, the governor was removed from his position and incarcerated in France. In 1812, Malet was allowed to retire to a sanatorium, upon the request of his wife. While at the sanatorium, Malet met with several agents of the House of Bourbon, who were working to replace the First Empire with a restored monarchy. Despite these connections, Malet appears to have had strong republican, rather than royalist, leanings. At the sanatorium he began to plan a coup which would topple the emperor. Napoleon was absent from France in 1812, commanding his troops in the invasion of Russia, providing Malet with an ideal opportunity to strike. With several others, he crafted detailed plans for a seizure of power, which was scheduled for late October. Malet and his co-conspirators even planned a provisional government, to be installed after the coup. Lazare Carnot was to be part of this government, serving as interim president.  Coup d'√©tat  = Seizure of power in Paris = At 4a.m. on 23 October 1812, Malet escaped from his captivity, donning a general's uniform. He approached Colonel Gabriel Soulier, who commanded the 10th Cohort of the French National Guard, informing the colonel that Napoleon had died while in Russia. Several forged documents convinced Soulier of the accuracy of Malet's claims, and the colonel, ill and stunned by his own \\"promotion\\" to general, which was among the forged papers, obeyed Malet when told to assemble the cohort. Soulier did not question Malet, even when the latter announced his intention to arrest several top officials, and the cohort followed its commander's example and submitted to the recent prisoner, following him to La Force Prison. At La Force, Malet ordered the release of two imprisoned generals, Victor Lahorie and Maximilian-Joseph Guidal. The guards obeyed him, and the generals, republicans like Malet, were convinced to join the coup. Malet sent Lahorie to arrest the Duke of Rovigo, the Minister of Police, while Guidal, with a company of National Guards, was to seize General Henri Clarke (Duke of Feltre), the Minister of War, and Archchancellor Cambac√©r√®s (Duke of Parma). Guidal, an enemy of Rovigo, insisted that he be allowed to accompany Lahorie. The two generals awoke Rovigo and placed him in La Force, neglecting to arrest the other two officials. Other senior officials, such as the Paris prefect of police √âtienne-Denis Pasquier, were arrested, and Lahorie was given the position of Minister of General Police. As this occurred, Malet confronted General Pierre-Augustin Hulin, the commander of the Paris garrison, in the latter's home. The general listened to the conspirator, who informed him that he (Hulin) had been relieved of his garrison command and that he was to turn over the seal of the 1st Division, which was located in Paris. Hulin demanded to see the official papers that would authorize such actions, whereupon Malet shot him in the jaw. = Suppression of the coup = Malet then proceeded to the military headquarters opposite Hulin's home. There, he met with the senior officer on duty there, Colonel . Doucet was suspicious, however, because the letters presented to him that referenced Napoleon's death stated that the Emperor had died on 7 October. Doucet had knowledge of letters written by Napoleon that had been sent after that date. The colonel also recognized Malet as a sanatorium inmate, and, once he was alone in his office with the general, overpowered him. Malet was placed under arrest, while Doucet ordered the National Guard's 10th Cohort to return to its barracks. He then released Rovigo and other officials imprisoned by the conspirators, and informed the Minister of War, Clarke, of these developments. Clarke, whose ministry was experiencing strained relations with that of Rovigo, sent a detachment of the Imperial Guard to protect the Ministry of Police and set about restoring order to Paris and, at the same time, making an effort to portray Rovigo as incompetent. One of Clarke's first actions was to inform Archchancellor Cambac√©r√®s of the coup, urging the man to bring Empress Marie-Louise and Napoleon's heir, the infant King of Rome, to Saint-Cloud. = Aftermath = Malet, Lahorie, and Guidal were tried before a council of war and were executed by firing squad on 29 October. Others, including Colonel Soulier, who had been tricked into enabling the coup, were shot on 31 October. Colonel , commander of the Paris Guard, which too was fooled into supporting the conspirators, was spared execution. The 10th Cohort was sent to Bremen, and Minister of War Clarke began to investigate all general officers present in Paris on 23 October, suspending from service those who he thought had acted in a way that showed support for Malet. Napoleon, rushing back to Paris from Russia, did not punish Rovigoto the disappointment of his rival, Clarke. Clarke had been spoken poorly of by Napoleon, who wondered why after hearing of his supposed death, the minister did not proclaim Napoleon II as the new Emperor.

Unlike children who acquire a language, adults learning a second language rarely reach the same level of competence as native speakers of that language. Some may stop studying a language before they have fully internalized it, and others may stop improving despite living in a foreign country for many years. It also appears that children are more likely than adults to reach native-like competence in a second language. There have been many studies that have attempted to explain these phenomena. A flurry of studies in the 1970s, often labelled the \\"good language learner studies\\", sought to identify the distinctive factors characteristic of successful learners. Although those studies are now widely regarded as simplistic, they did serve to identify a number of factors affecting language acquisition. More detailed research on many of these specific factors continues today. For this reason, individual variation in second-language acquisition is not generally considered a single area of research. Rather, it is simply a convenient way to categorize studies about language aptitude, age and language learning, strategy use, and affective factors that affect language acquisition. Language aptitude There are two definitions that help explain individual difference variables. The first is predictive, language aptitude is related to a set of cognitive abilities. These cognitive abilities allow one to predict how well an individual can learn a foreign language. These abilities change under limited time and circumstances. The second definition is interactional. It views language aptitude as comprehension abilities during second language learning. Aptitude is or can be subject to change according to an environment. It highlights that no specific instruction works for all second language learners. Therefore, in order for an individual to grasp a second language, there must be an adaption. Where the learner‚Äôs abilities can flourish under different learning conditions. A meta-analysis brought to light that the importance of aptitude is an overestimate when it comes to grammatical capability. In specific conditions, language aptitude is a conscious construct which affects learning results. Language aptitude can be useful in predicting the beginning stages of second language learning, when it comes to grammatical competence, but it is not a reliable way to learning stages. Tests of language aptitude have proven extremely effective in predicting which learners will be successful in learning.Bylund et al., 2012 However, considerable controversy remains about whether language aptitude is properly regarded as a unitary concept, an organic property of the brain, or as a complex of factors including motivation and short-term memory. Research has generally shown that language aptitude is quite distinct from general aptitude or intelligence, as measured by various tests, and is itself fairly consistently measurable by different tests. Language aptitude research is often criticized for being irrelevant to the problems of language learners, who must attempt to learn a language regardless of whether they are gifted for the task or not. This claim is reinforced by research findings that aptitude is largely unchangeable. In addition, traditional language aptitude measures such as the Modern Language Aptitude Test strongly favor decontextualized knowledge of the sort used in taking tests, rather than the sort used in conversation. For this reason little research is carried out on aptitude today. However, operators of selective language programs such as the United States Defense Language Institute continue to use language aptitude testing as part of applicant screening. Age How children acquire native language (L1) and the relevance of this to foreign language (L2) learning has long been debated. Although evidence for L2 learning ability declining with age is controversial, a common notion is that children learn L2s easily and older learners rarely achieve fluency. This assumption stems from ‚Äòcritical period‚Äô (CP) ideas. A CP was popularised by Eric Lenneberg in 1967 for L1 acquisition, but considerable interest now surrounds age effects on second-language acquisition (SLA).. SLA theories explain learning processes and suggest causal factors for a possible CP for SLA, mainly attempting to explain apparent differences in language aptitudes of children and adults by distinct learning routes, and clarifying them through psychological mechanisms. Research explores these ideas and hypotheses, but results are varied: some demonstrate pre-pubescent children acquire language easily, and some that older learners have the advantage, and yet others focus on existence of a CP for SLA. Recent studies have recognised that certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, though others remain intact.. In terms of specific ages, Steven Pinker and colleagues conducted a large-scale internet study aimed at measuring individual‚Äôs age, English proficiency, and amount of time spent practicing English. The findings suggest that the ability to learn a new language with fluency declines after age 18 and must begin by age 10. There are three main factors why our ability to acquire a new language declines after the age of 18. First, significant social changes usually occur at the age of 18. For example, during this period of time individuals may be heading off to college or entering the workforce. As a result, less time is dedicated towards learning a new language. Secondly, an individual‚Äôs primary language may impede the development of a newer language. The grammatical rules of our first language become more readily available in our minds as we are exposed to our first language in larger quantities. Lastly, our brains are still developing. In this case, learning becomes more difficult because the brain is undergoing significant changes during our late teenage years and early-20s. Strategy use The effective use of strategies has been shown to be critical to successful language learning, so much so that Canale and Swain (1980) included \\"strategic competence\\" among the four components of communicative competence.. Research here has also shown significant pedagogical effects. This has given rise to \\"strategies-based instruction.\\" Strategies are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies, although there are other ways of categorizing them. Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning, such as mnemonics or using a dictionary. Learners (and native speakers) use communicative strategies to get meaning across even when they lack access to the correct language: for example, by using pro-forms like \\"thing\\", or non-spoken means such as mime. Communicative strategies may not have any direct bearing on learning, and some strategies such as avoidance (not using a form with which one is uncomfortable) may actually hinder learning. Children use their own strategies of cross reference to learn second languages. A longitudinal study investigated preschool children in an environment where they were exposed to English as a second language. What was noted was that the children applied the knowledge from their first language, using patterns to develop their phonology. It was seen that mere immersion and rehearsal was an effective way for the children to increase their proficiency of their second language. Learners from different cultures use strategies in different ways,. as a research tradition led by Rebecca Oxford has demonstrated. Related to this are differences in strategy use between male and female learners. Numerous studies have shown that female learners typically use strategies more widely and intensively than males; this may be related to the statistical advantage which female learners enjoy in language learning. Different learning strategies have been evaluated and tested to determine the efficacy of their methods. A strategy that was found effective with English speaking Chinese learners was the use of a virtual environment. A virtual environment consists of a digital world in which a person may experience whatever is programmed. A virtual environment was created using the online virtual world known as Second Life, where the users could interact with objects, learning the words and sounds simultaneously. This learning strategy was found to be significantly more effective than traditional methods of displaying solely an image and sound. A similar study was done immersing Chinese learners in a virtual environment and found visualization of the objects increased the learning proficiency and scores on the proficiency test. The results of the two studies suggest an advantage when using a virtual environment juxtaposed to traditional methods among Chinese learners. Affective factors Affective factors relate to the learner's emotional state and attitude toward the target language. Research on affect in language learning is still strongly influenced by Bloom's taxonomy, which describes the affective levels of receiving, responding, valuing, organization, and self-characterization through one's value system. It has also been informed in recent years by research in neurobiology and neurolinguistics. A research study conducted by Ni (2012), was interested in the role that affective factors played in second-language acquisition (SLA).Additionally, she wanted to know how to apply this knowledge to the context of an educational setting. For example, many instructors want to create lessons for students that facilitate the process of learning a new foreign language. The study Ni (2012) conducted sought to find what important skills students could implement in their SLA pursuits. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to 50 students enrolled in the Foreign Language Department at Heze University in China. The questions collected data on participants‚Äô English fluency, affective factors influence in their SLA, and the preferred method of feedback from their instructor. The main findings displayed how affective factors (e.g. motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety) may advance the acquisition of English as a second language. By using this knowledge, teachers can strengthen their students‚Äô emotional states and create a more welcoming class environment. In doing so, students may be able to acquire a second language more effectively. =Affective filter= Furthermore, researchers believe that language learners all possess an affective filter which affects language acquisition. If a student possesses a high filter they are less likely to engage in language learning because of shyness, concern for grammar or other factors. Students possessing a lower affective filter will be more likely to engage in learning because they are less likely to be impeded by other factors. The affective filter is an important component of second- language learning. =Anxiety= Although some continue to propose that a low level of anxiety may be helpful, studies have almost unanimously shown that anxiety damages students' prospects for successful learning. Anxiety is often related to a sense of threat to the learner's self-concept in the learning situation, for example if a learner fears being ridiculed for a mistake. =Personality factors= Second-language acquisition is defined as the learning and adopting of a language that is not the learner's native language. Studies have shown that extroverts acquire a second language better than introverts. One particular study done by Naiman reflected this point. The subjects were 72 Canadian high school students from grades 8, 10 and 12 who were studying French as a second language. Naiman gave them all questionnaires to establish their psychological profiles, which also included a French listening test and imitation test. He found that approximately 70% of the students with the higher grades (B or higher) would consider themselves extroverts. Extroverts will be willing to try to communicate even if they are not sure they will succeed. Two scientists, Kinginger and Farrell, conducted interviews with U.S. students after their study abroad program in France in 2003. They found that many of the students would avoid interaction with the native speakers at all costs, while others jumped at the opportunity to speak the language. Those who avoided interaction were typically quiet, reserved people (i.e., introverts). Logically, anxiety will cause students not to try and advance their skills, especially when they feel they are under pressure. Just the lack of practice will make introverts less likely to fully acquire the second language. =Social effects= The process of language learning can be very stressful, and the impact of positive or negative attitudes from the surrounding society can be critical. One aspect that has received particular attention is the relationship of gender roles to language achievement. Studies across numerous cultures have shown that women, on the whole, enjoy an advantage over men. Some have proposed that this is linked to gender roles. Doman notes in a journal devoted to issues of Cultural effects on SLA, \\"Questions abound about what defines SLA, how far its borders extend, and what the attributions and contributions of its research are. Thus, there is a great amount of heterogeneity in the entire conceptualization of SLA. Some researchers tend to ignore certain aspects of the field, while others scrutinize those same aspects piece by piece.\\". Community attitudes toward the language being learned can also have a profound impact on Second Language Acquisition. Where the community has a broadly negative view of the target language and its speakers, or a negative view of its relation to them, learning is typically much more difficult. This finding has been confirmed by research in numerous contexts. A widely cited example is the difficulty faced by Navajo children in learning English as a second language. Other common social factors include the attitude of parents toward language study, and the nature of group dynamics in the language classroom. Additionally, early attitudes may strengthen motivation and facility with language in general, particularly with early exposure to the language. All these sum up to affect learners' acquisition of the target language and learners' language/ code choice when multiple varieties of a (second) language are involved. =Motivation= The role of motivation in SLA has been the subject of extensive scholarship, closely influenced by work in motivational psychology. Motivation is internally complex, and D√∂rnyei begins his work by stating that \\"strictly speaking, there is no such thing as motivation.\\". There are many different kinds of motivation; these are often divided into types such as integrative or instrumental, intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to the desire to do something for an internal reward. Most studies have shown it to be substantially more effective in long-term language learning than extrinsic motivation, for an external reward such as high grades or praise. Integrative and instrumental orientations refer to the degree that a language is learned \\"for its own sake\\" (integratively) or for instrumental purposes. Studies have not consistently shown either form of motivation to be more effective than the other, and the role of each is probably conditioned by various personality and cultural factors. Some research has shown that motivation correlates strongly with proficiency, indicating both that successful learners are motivated and that success improves motivation. Thus motivation is not fixed, but is strongly affected by feedback from the environment. Accordingly, the study of motivation in SLA has also examined many of the external factors discussed above, such as the effect of instructional techniques on motivation. An accessible summary of this research can be found in D√∂rnyei (2001). In their research on willingness to communicate, MacIntyre et al. have shown that motivation is not the final construct before learners engage in communication. In fact, learners may be highly motivated yet remain unwilling to communicate.. The European Union Lifelong learning programme has funded a project to research and build a set of best practices to motivate adult language learners, called Don't Give Up.

The school cost $2.5 million and built to house a total of 3,000 students.Chicago Tribune - Children Parade In Dedication Of Two New Schools - September 29, 1928 Manley became a senior high school in 1933 when junior high schools were abolished in Chicago on July 12 of that year. Manley housed an elementary school within its building from 1933 until 1943. The U.S. Navy occupied the school building from January 1944 through the end of World War II to develop programs designed for and to aid in the war effort, which resulted in students being transferred to neighboring schools. In September 1946, the school served as a trade school opening as Manley Trade and Vocational School,Chicago Tribune - Manley Trade School Opens In September - August 4, 1946 later becoming known as Cregier Vocational High School. By 1957, the trade school was relocated, and Manley was once again converted into an elementary and middle school. The elementary school was phased out and an extension of Marshall High School was created on the campus, serving at the location for two years: 1969‚Äì71. In June 1973, the Chicago Board of Education designated Manley as a \\"senior high school\\" and approved phasing out the seventh and eighth grade program.

The genitalia are complex and provide the basis for species discrimination in most families and also in family identification. The genitalia are attached onto the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures in the insect groups with a wide variety of complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the ductus bursae in females. The arrangement of genitalia is important in the courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of genitalia of a species led to the use of the morphological study of genitalia as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy. Configurations There are three basic configurations of genitalia in the majority of the Lepidoptera based on how the arrangement in females of openings for copulation, fertilisation and egg-laying has evolved: * Exoporian : Hepialidae and related families have an external groove that carries sperm from the copulatory opening (gonopore) to the (ovipore) and are termed Exoporian. * Monotrysian : Primitive groups have a single genital aperture near the end of the abdomen through which both copulation and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia. * Ditrysian : The remaining groups have an internal duct that carry sperm and form the Ditrysia, with two distinct openings each for copulation and egg-laying. Male Genitalia in male and female of any particular Lepidopteran species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (female) and key (male). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'vinculum'.Scoble (1995). Section Adult abdomen, (pp 98 to 102). They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers, valvae (singular valva), or 'harpes'). The male has a median tubular organ (called aedeagus or phallus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all Lepidopterans; however, the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms. The males of many species of Papilionoidea are furnished with secondary sexual characteristics. These consist of scent-producing organs, brushes, and brands or pouches of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating with a male of the correct species.. Section Introduction, (pp 1 to 35). Female While the layout of internal genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all Lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join together to form a common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina. When copulation takes place, the male butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (referred to as 'spermatophore') in a receptacle of the female (called the 'corpus bursae'). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube (the 'ductus bursae') into a special seminal receptacle (the 'spermatheca'), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore may be at the end of a modified 'ovipositor' or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae. Butterflies of the Parnassinae (Family Papilionidae) and some Acraeini (Family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the sphragis, to the abdomen of the female after copulation preventing her from mating again. The females of some moths have a scent-emitting organ located at the tip of the abdomen.

This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. Description The pediment's center focal point is the figure of allegorical Peace, which is dressed in armor and is depicted protecting Genius. Leaning against Peace's proper right leg, Genius holds a torch that symbolizes immortality in his proper right hand. Peace stands in front of an olive tree. To Peace's proper left is a figure of Agriculture, and next to that figure is a reaper with his assistant, a farmer with his bull, a putti carrying grapes, and a mother with her child who plays with a ram. To the proper right of Peace is Industry, and next to him is a printmaker, an ironworker, a founder, a factory girl and a fisherman. The corners of the pediment have waves, which represent the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The pediment is made of Georgia marble. =Condition= In 1993 Apotheosis of Democracy was surveyed by art conservators from the Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as \\"well maintained.\\" Acquisition, creation and installation The original pediment was commissioned to Erastus Dow Palmer in 1857, however, the work was never completed due to lack of funding. Another competition was held in 1908 and Bartlett was chosen. The figures were modeled in Paris, France and Washington in the years from 1911 to 1914, and were carved by the Piccirilli Brothers from 1914 to 1916. The pediment was dedicated on August 2, 1916. Related works In March, 1963 plaster maquettes of the pediment were given to the U.S. Government by Bartlett's stepdaughter, Armistead Peter III. The works are on display in the Capitol underground hallway that heads to the Rayburn House Office Building. As of 1995 a Study for Apotheosis of Democracy by Bartlett was in the collection of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art. A bronze sculpture (54 x 54.5 x 18) on a wooden base, it depicts Peace and Genius. It was purchased in 1959 and as of 1995 it was surveyed as needing urgent treatment.

As the result of studying with clarinetist Harold Wright while attending the Marlboro Music Festival, Ludewig-Verdehr employs a double-lip embouchure, wherein the upper lip wraps around the top teeth, which are normally in direct contact with the mouthpiece of the clarinet. The effect is to open the mouth and alter the placement of the tongue for a rounder, fuller sound.

A geolocator periodically records ambient light level (solar irradiance) to determine location. History Animal tracking using light level data appears to have been first carried out on elephant seals. Although not described until 1992, the first device to be developed was reportedly in 1989 as an adaptation of a TDR (time-depth recorder) and called a geographic location, time-depth recorder (GLTDR) weighing 196g.Documenting Migrations of Northern Elephant Seals Using Day Length, Delong R.L., Stewart B.S., Hill R.D., Marine Mammal Science 8:155-159, 1992 Also in 1992 was a publication by a different group with a similar design (weight 113g) who called it a global location sensor (GLS) though no field use was mentioned.Estimation of location: global coverage using light intensity, Wilson R.P., Ducamp J., Rees W.G., Culik B.M., Niekamp K., in Wildlife Telemetry: remote monitoring and tracking of animals, Priede I.M., Swift S.M. (eds), Ellis Horward, Chichester, p131-134, 1992 The use of dedicated light level recorders for tracking birds was pioneered in the 1990s by engineer, Vsevolod Afanasyev, and scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) who first developed a device in an attempt to record the movements of juvenile wandering albatross during the many years between fledging and returning to their colony to breed. From albatrosses and other seabirds the use of geolocators has been extended to other migratory species, including waders, wildfowl, raptors and songbirds as designs have become gradually smaller and more energy efficient. Methods Light level geolocators primarily use an electronic light sensor to record light level and may also make other measurements to aid geolocation (e.g. temperature or water immersion). The smallest are archival types that do not use satellite or radio telemetry to offload data and recapture of the bird is necessary to obtain the data. The disadvantage of having to recapture is offset by the miniature size to which archival loggers can be made. By using low power design techniques and data compression they can record data for long periods of time. Recording light levels over time produces data that can be used to calculate latitude and longitude readings of a bird's long-distance movements. The traditionally used 'threshold analysis method' requires only twilight data accurately time- stamped. Typically, daylight length (the time between dawn and dusk) is used to determine latitude, while the mid-time between a dawn and dusk is used to determine longitude. In this way, two position fixes can be obtained daily. Other analysis techniques can include analysis of the dawn and dusk curve (rate of change of light), or use the noon light level to attempt cloud compensation. The location data so derived is not as accurate as that from GPS or PTT (platform transmitter terminal) tracking involving satellites, but the devices can be made considerably lighter and cheaper. Other sensors, such as for recording temperature, or whether the logger is wet or dry, may be used in conjunction with the light-level logging in order to provide further ecological information. The devices may be attached to the bird being tracked by a harness, or to the band on the bird's leg. The weights of geolocators range from 0.3g upwards, with a battery life of 6 months to 5 years. The main accuracy limitation of light level geolocation is due to the uncertainty in the amount of attenuation of the ambient light level at any particular time. Light attenuation can have many causes e.g. cloud, feathers, foliage, topography. Because of this, the quality of the resulting location calculations varies with species, tag attachment technique, habitat and behaviour.

Operational history The 18th Artillery Division was formed by combining the staff and some of the remaining corps troops from the 18th Panzer Division, being disbanded on October 1, with other stray units. This division was the first unit planned as an independent and mobile artillery force; and the planned strength for the division was never achieved. A special element of this division was that it had its own (heavy) infantry element, the Sch√ºtzen-Abteilung 88 (tmot) (also known as Art.-Kampf-Btln. 88 and Art.-Alarm-Abteilung 18). Having the mission of defending the artillery in all dangerous situations this battalion, thoroughly trained in rear guard actions, saved the division from total destruction no less than three times. The division was part of the XXXVIII Army Corps in the 1st Panzer Army. It was in action until late March 1944, when it was encircled in the Kamenets- Podolsky pocket.

Architecture The church is inspired by Byzantine and late Romanesque architecture. The plan is cruciform with a square-shaped central tower, and it is built in red brick with corners and details in granite. A double granite staircase leads up to the main entrance which is located in the south-eastern cross arm. Above its portal, which has a round-arched tympanum, there is a large rose window. Interior and furnishings The vault in the central tower is decorated with lime frescos depicting Christ surrounded by Evangelist symbols and angels. In the three windows of the choir, there are glass paintings by Axel Hou and the walls have blinds with verses by Brorson. The original altarpiece painting (1903) is by Poul Steffensen. The pulpit and the font are carved in granite by A. Bundg√•rd. The 64-armed candle holder was designed by Erik Herl√∏v in 1951.

It is one of the oldest educational institutions in Russia, having been founded in 1709. History In 1705, Peter the Great decreed that Protestant churches could be established in St. Petersburg. The first reference to the school is in 1709, in a letter (now in the Archive of the Russian Navy) by Admiral Cornelius Cruys to the Emperor (Peter) regarding the establishment of a Lutheran church and school at his estate, located on the site of what is now the New Hermitage on Millionnaya Street in St. Petersburg's German settlement. In 1761, the German theologian, geographer, historian, and teacher Anton Friedrich B√ºsching was invited by the Lutheran community of St. Petersburg to be headmaster of the school at the Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The current school building, at numbers 22-24 Nevsky Prospect, was built in the 1760s and rebuilt several times - in 1799, in 1876‚Äì1877, and in 1913‚Äì1915. Among the educators who taught at the school are: *The natural scientist Erik Laxmann (1737‚Äì1796). *The philosopher and Latin scholar Alexander Galich (1783‚Äì1848), who was a teacher of Pushkin. *The writer Ivan Born (1778‚Äì1851), compiler of the first Russian language textbook. *The writer and poet Vasili Popugaev (1778 or 1779‚Äì1816 (probable)). *The philologist and pedagogue Nikolai Gretsch (1787‚Äì1867). *The mathematician Nikolai Brashman (1796‚Äì1866). *The physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804‚Äì1865), discoverer of Lenz's Law. *The phalerist (scholar of medals) Julius Iversen (1823‚Äì1900). *The physicist Orest Khvolson (1852‚Äì1934). War and Revolution In 1912, the school celebrated its 200th anniversary. By this time it had become the largest secondary school in Russia, with more than 1600 students, of whom 25% were Russian. The school at this time enjoyed a stellar reputation for its broad education, particularly the teaching of foreign languages. Under the direction of the church council of the Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, the school's finances were kept on a sound basis, and further expansion and additions to the school buildings were planned. Then came the First World War. With the war came anti-German sentiment. The Imperial Ministry of Education decreed that all classes were to be taught in Russian, and that the school name was to be written in Russian. Teachers who were not fluent in Russian left, and gymnastics instructor Anton Preis, a German national, was expelled by the authorities. Anti-German sentiment led some families to withdraw their children from the school, while senior students left to join the Russian army. After 1918, the school bore the following names: United Soviet Labor School ‚Ññ 4, ‚Ññ 14, ‚Ññ 28, ‚Ññ 41, 222-I and 217-I Schools of the Kuibyshev district of Leningrad.

Biography  He came from an Orthodox family. While he was still a boy, they moved to Danzig, where he grew up. After completing his primary education, he was apprenticed to a carpenter. His parents were strongly opposed to his desires to become an artist but, in 1895, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe. In 1897, he and his friend, Hans Purrmann, went to Munich to open a studio. While there, he continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Nikolaus Gysis then, in 1899, took lessons at the private art school operated by Heinrich Knirr and studied plein aire painting with Heinrich von Z√ºgel. He also became a member of a cultural association known as \\"Sturmfackel\\" (a type of poppy), that met at the Caf√© Stefanie. In the fall of 1903, he went to Paris and established a circle of German-speaking artists who met at Le D√¥me Caf√©. Two years later, he participated in the third exhibition of the Salon d'Automne at the Grand Palais. In 1907, he worked at the newly founded teaching studios of Henri Matisse. Between 1910 and 1913, he made regular trips to the south of France and Tunisia.Klaus und Erika Mann, Das Buch von der Riviera. Reprint from the original edition of 1931, Rowohlt 2004 During the First World War, he volunteered and fought as a German soldier in Artois and Flanders. He was awarded the Iron Cross in 1915. After the war, he returned to Germany and married Eugenie Schindler (1894-1953), a photographer and actress who went by the name Genia Morelli.Deutsche Biographie: Genia Morelli They eventually settled in Berlin and, in 1922, he had his first solo exhibition, arranged by Alfred Flechtheim. From 1924 to 1926, he was back in Paris, serving as Flechtheim's agent. In 1928, he became a member of the Berlin Secession and served on its board of directors. Five years later, due to the increasing persecution of Jews in Germany, he went to Rapallo, Italy, where he stayed with his friend and student, Bob Gesinus-Visser (1898-1978). In 1935, he went to Mallorca. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he went to New York to stay with his friend, the actor Erik Charell. He did not want to stay there, however, and went back to Europe; first to Dubrovnik, then Ischia, where he lived at the artists' colony. He supported himself with occasional painting sales and financial aid from his family, including his now ex-wife, Genia. In 1937, his works were placed on the list of Degenerate Art.Verschollene Werke Rudolf Levy: Missing and/or degenerate After World War II began, his residence permit was cancelled and he had to leave Ischia. Charell worked hard to obtain a visa for him to return to the United States or seek refuge in South America, but to no avail. In 1940, he was able to find a place to stay with friends in Florence.Hans Purrmann, Florenz 1935-1943 After the German Army occupied Italy in 1943, he had to go underground.Zeittafel: Italien 1938 - 1945 In December of that year, he was lured into a trap by SS agents pretending they were art buyers. He was arrested by the Gestapo, briefly imprisoned at Le Murate, then placed on a transport to Auschwitz.

The tell was the site of a small village of , which was first settled in the late 8th millennium BC. The tell was discovered by French customs officers, M Company and Lieutenant Potut. Laurisson Ward visited again in 1939 and collected material from the surface, now in the Peabody Museum. Tell Ramad lay somewhat forgotten until it was rediscovered by W.J. van Liere and Henri de Contenson, the latter leading excavations in 8 seasons between 1963 and 1973. Notable features from the earliest stage include a number of 3‚Äì4 metre diameter, lime-plaster floored, clay lined oval pits with ovens & clay bins that were suggested to have been used as houses. There was nothing to suggest a break in occupation between level I and II of the site. Burial customs appear to have been unchanged between the two periods. Burials were mostly done in communal graves, with small deposits of grave goods. Different flint tools were found at the site in both periods, including sickles and arrowheads. Tell Ramad is notable as one of the few sites fundamental to our understanding of the origin of agriculture with finds including various types of domesticated wheat, barley and flax. Emmer wheat is an important characteristic of Basin sites in this area, where it is thought to have been introduced. Wild plant foods include pistachios, almonds, figs and wild pears. The mammal fauna from level I at Tell Ramad shows that both sheep and goats were fully and simultaneously domesticated at the site, although the sheep-to-goat ratio is more than 3 to 1.

Synopsis Crime After Crime tells the dramatic story of the legal battle to free Debbie Peagler, an incarcerated survivor of domestic violence. She was wrongly convicted of the murder of her abusive boyfriend, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Her story takes an unexpected turn two decades later when two rookie land-use attorneys step forward to take her case. Through their perseverance, they bring to light long-lost witnesses, new testimonies from the men who committed the murder, and proof of perjured evidence. Their investigation ultimately attracts global attention to victims of wrongful incarceration and abuse, and becomes a matter of life and death once more. Production Potash produced Crime After Crime over a five and a half year span, gaining unprecedented access to film in a maximum-security California prison, despite strict rules that barred members of the media from filming interviews with specific inmates. The filmmaker managed to bring his cameras into the prison by becoming the \\"legal videographer\\" for Debbie Peagler, and by producing an entirely separate documentary about the rehabilitative and employment programs available to inmates at the prison.https://www.indiewire.com/2011/06/in-his-own-words-yoav-potash-shares- a-scene-from-crime-after-crime-53462/ Potash wrote about these activities and his motivations for making the film in articles published by The Wall Street Journal and TheWrap. During production, Potash filmed the music group Arrested Development as they visited Debbie Peagler in prison, and sang with Peagler and the inmate gospel choir that she led. Their visit was meant to support Peagler's legal battle for her freedom, and call attention to the plight of other victims of abuse and wrongful incarceration. The band's performance of the Solomon Burke song \\"None of Are Free,\\" with Peagler and the choir accompanying Arrested Development, is excerpted in the film and played in its entirety over the end credits.https://www.indiewire.com/2011/06/in-his- own-words-yoav-potash-shares-a-scene-from-crime-after-crime-53462/ The film was funded by the Sundance Documentary Film Program, the San Francisco Foundation, the Lynn and Jules Kroll Fund for Jewish Documentary Film at the Foundation for Jewish Culture, the Pacific Pioneer Fund, the Bay Area Video Coalition, the Women in Film Foundation Film Finishing Fund supported by Netflix, the Jewish Federation of the Greater East Bay, and Jewish Family and Children's Services of San Francisco.http://crimeaftercrime.com/about-the- film/funders/ Release The film was picked up by the Oprah Winfrey Network for broadcast and home video distribution. OWN gave the film a national television primetime premiere in November 2011. PBS NewsHour also broadcast a nine-minute excerpt of the film as part of its Economist Film Project, as a collaboration with The Economist. The film streamed for two years on Netflix and now streams here on Amazon Prime. Reception \\"Crime After Crime\\" earned strong praise from critics and audiences alike. On Amazon Prime, the film earned a 5-star average rating from user reviews, and the streaming service describes the film as \\"one of the most compelling and highly awarded documentaries of all time.\\" The film received a 91% positive approval score on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". It also holds a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars on Netflix, generated from an average from 104,747 user ratings. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011, and went on to earn a total of 25 major honors including the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, The National Board of Review‚Äôs Freedom of Expression Award, and The Hillman Prize for Broadcast Journalism. The film was a New York Times Critics' Pick. In her review of Crime After Crime, New York Times film critic Jeanette Catsoulis called the film a \\"wrenching documentary\\" and wrote that its portrayal of Debbie Peagler \\"makes it difficult to leave the theater with dry eyes and an untouched heart.\\" She added that filmmaker Yoav Potash's \\"moral outrage is magnificent, swelling from hushed to howling without the help of narration or posturing from the unfailingly dignified Ms. Peagler or her quietly dedicated lawyers.\\" The Washington Post listed the film as an Editors' Pick. The Posts film critic Stephanie Merry began her review with: \\"Some movies prove so eye-opening that a viewer may feel the urge to recount the story, start to finish, to friends and acquaintances. Crime After Crime is that kind of film. The shocking, emotional documentary follows an abused, incarcerated woman whose quest for freedom meets a never-ending series of outlandish obstacles.\\" New York Magazine also listed the film as a Critics' Pick, calling the film \\"riveting and devastating\\", and describing it as a story about \\"a great miscarriage of justice ‚Äî but also one of heroic legal perseverance, with a surprisingly colorful cast of characters.\\" The Los Angeles Times listed the documentary as \\"a must-see film\\" and The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \\"a tremendously moving story, strong in social commitment and deftly woven out of years of footage.\\" Upon its Sundance Film Festival premiere, The Salt Lake Tribune called the film \\"a riveting examination of justice denied through political manipulation and prosecutorial callousness.\\" Among the first honors bestowed upon the film were the Henry Hampton Award for Excellence in Film and Digital Media, presented by the Council on Foundations, and the Pursuit of Justice Award, presented by the California Women's Law Center.

Dunbar opened in 1942 and is operated by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) district. The school is named in honor of the African‚ÄìAmerican poet, novelist, and playwright Paul Laurence Dunbar.\\"Dunbar at a glance\\". Chicago Sun-Times. December 29, 1993. 76. History Opening in September 1942 as a Dunbar Trade School, the school was created to provide skill workers for the war. When the school opened, the school had a student enrollment of 1,500; Mostly all of which were African‚ÄìAmerican. The school was considered as a \\"vocational branch\\" of Wendell Phillips High School, considering both schools were predominately African‚ÄìAmerican. In 1946, the Chicago Public Schools changed the trade school into a public high school, accepting ninth grade students in January of that year. The school's first location was in a former elementary school building located at 4401 South St. Lawrence Avenue. In addition to the school building, twenty‚Äìtwo mobile classroom which served as vocational shops were constructed on the site over the course of several months after its opening. By 1952, Dunbar suffered from issues dealing with overcrowding and aging of the school building. The Chicago Board of Education decided that a new school building was needed for Dunbar. A vacant site about two and a half miles north from the school's location was voted on and selected as the new Dunbar's location in mid‚Äì1954; costing the district a mere $7 million to construct. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new school occurred in April 1955 with Chicago school officials and then newly elected Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, construction began at 3000 South Parkway Avenue (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) shortly thereafter. The new Dunbar Vocational High School building opened for students for the 1956‚Äì57 school year. By the school 20th anniversary in 1962, the school's enrollment was at 2,300; which included students taking night classes and drop-outs enrolled in trade classes. Other information On February 5, 1968, students at the school staged a walk‚Äìout and gathered on the street in front of the school after rumors of the firing of a popular teacher circulated. It was also rumored that day the school would change from a vocational high school to a regular general high school. The walk‚Äìout caused classes to be canceled for four hours. The incident caused the disruption of traffic and damaging of several automobiles; which resulted in three arrests. In December 1968, the school held the \\"Afro‚ÄìAmerican Expo '68\\" which included local politicians, businessmen and activists. On January 9, 2009, five people were shot outside the school after a varsity basketball game against John Hope College Prep had concluded around 8PM. The shooting was considered gang-related. On May 23, 2013, A 16‚Äìyear old female student was pushed down a flight of stairs and assaulted by a male security guard at the school. The incident was filmed via cell phone video by another student. Athletics Dunbar competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). Dunbar sport teams are known as MightyMen/MightyWomen. The Boys' basketball team were Public League champions in the 1955‚Äì56 season and regional champions in 2011‚Äì12.

At the time of its opening, the New York store was the largest in the world. First store in Chicago Siegel- Cooper began as a discount department store on State Street in the Loop. It was founded by Henry Siegel, Frank H. Cooper and Isaac Keim in 1887. Four years later, the store moved into the eight-story Second Leiter Building at State and Van Buren Street, designed by William Le Baron Jenney, where it stayed until 1930, after a 1914-15 reorganization into Associated Dry Goods Corp., but keeping the Siegel-Cooper name in Chicago. The building was then occupied from 1931 to 1986 by Sears, Roebuck & Company. It continues in use, most recently in the 21st century as a college campus. Second store in New York City In September 1896,Abelson, Elaine S. \\"Siegel-Cooper\\" in , p.1182 the company opened a store in New York City, a huge emporium in the Ladies' Mile Shopping District, joining the other major department stores in the neighborhood. Their steel-framed building, the first department store in New York to be so constructed, was the largest store in the world at the time, and was designed in Beaux-Arts style by DeLemos & Cordes, who would go on to design the R. H. Macy's store in Herald Square, which then took the title of largest. The six-story Siegel-Cooper store was located at 616-632 Sixth Avenue between West 18th and 19th Streets, and was built between 1895 and 1897, then expanded in 1899., pp.90-92 The steel-framed construction of the \\"Big Store\\", as it was called at the time, enabled the building to have large interior spaces with uninterrupted selling floors, and allowed for skylit courts. Siegel-Cooper took full advantage of the novelty - to New York City - of steel-framing by advertising the building as \\"the only and absolutely fire- proof and perfectly safe store in New York City.\\" The store offered a wide variety of dry goods in its 18 acres (7 ha.), as well as other amenities such as a grocery department, barber shop, theatre, telegraph office, art gallery, photo studio, bank, dental office, a 350-person restaurant, and a conservatory which sold live plants. The main floor featured a copy of Daniel Chester French's statue The RepublicThe statue is now at Forest Lawn Cemetery. , pp.191-192 inside a marble-enclosed fountain. This was a popular meeting place, giving rise to the phrase \\"Meet me at the fountain,\\" which the store used as a slogan, along with \\"A City in Itself\\" and \\"Everything Under the Sun\\". At its peak, the store employed over 3,000 people, mostly girls and women, and offered its employees an infirmary, a parlor and a gymnasium. The company also published a newspaper for its workers, called Thought and Work. Third store in Boston In 1905, The Henry Siegel Company opened a large store in Boston, at 600 Washington Street. The Boston store was converted into an office building and a movie theater in 1915. The light court on Washington Street was infilled in the 1970s, and the theater closed in the 1990s. The building was further modified to create a new entrance to the MBTA Orange Line Chinatown station in 2004. The building is now home to Commonwealth of Massachusetts offices and small retailers. The fate of the disused theater is undecided. Decline, closing and renewal In 1902, Henry Siegel sold the company to one of his major stockholders, Captain Joseph B. Greenhut and his son Benedict J. Greenhut, who merged the store with B. Altman across the street in New York City, creating a mega-store which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1913‚Äì14 J.P. Morgan was involved in combining the company with other retailers as the Associated Dry Goods Corp. Siegel-Cooper declared bankruptcy in 1915, and the New York store closed in 1917, becoming a military hospital during World War I, pp.191-192 and then a warehouse. The Chicago store closed around 1930, and that building was taken over by Sears, Roebuck as their flagship store in 1931. In the 21st century, it is the Chicago campus of Robert Morris University Illinois.

Jerrold was one of the first manufacturers of cable television equipment and also constructed entire cable systems.See Patrick Parsons, Blue Skies: A History of Cable Television, Temple University Press, 2008, p. 68-69, 113-115, and Brian Lockman and Don Sarvey, Pioneers of Cable Television: The Pennsylvania Founders of an Industry, McFarland, 2005, p. 62-84, for Jerrold's importance to the early history of the cable television industry. Lockman and Sarvey quote Simons' oral history in telling the Milton Shapp/Jerrold story. Simons designed one of the first converters and the two most important pieces of the early test equipment, the Model 704 Field Strength Meter and Model 900 Sweep Frequency Generator. He also authored a seminal technical handbook on cable television systems, and served on national and international engineering standards committees. Fellow cable engineer Archer Taylor stated that Simons was seen as the leading technical expert at Jerrold for over two decades.Archer S. Taylor, History Between Their Ears: Recollections of Pioneer CATV Engineers, The Cable Center, 2000, p. 44. Taylor was the interviewer for Simons' oral history, and his section on Simons, p. 40-46, is largely based on that oral history.  Early years  Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Simons' interest in radio began at an early age, and he obtained his amateur radio license (callsign W3UB) in 1930. Simons started his career as a radio troubleshooter for RCA in 1932 in Camden, and worked for RCA while he attended college. In 1938 he graduated from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania,with distinctionUniversity of Pennsylvania.

His first project was to design a high-to-low frequency converter. He and other Jerrold engineers worked out of Simons' personal laboratory located on the second floor of a stained glass factory in Bryn Athyn, Pa., until a new Jerrold lab was built in Hatboro, Pa., in 1955. Simons characterized his role at Jerrold in his resume: \\"Three of us were primarily responsible for equipment design in the early years. Donald Kirk was talented in coming up with new ideas, my contribution was often in getting a system to work, and Henry Arbeiter took all the bright ideas and made them producible.\\"Simons resume Other engineering colleagues included Eric Winston, Mike Jeffers, Frank Ragone, Caywood Cooley, Vic Nicholson, Len Ecker, and Bill Felsher.Taylor, p. 44. Simons successively became chief engineer, chief test equipment engineer, vice president and director of advanced development.

In February 1992, Simons was interviewed by Archer Taylor covering a broad range of topics from his life in cable television. The Audio and Transcript of the interview are now archived in the oral histories maintained by The Cable Center. Simons had originally patented a directional coupler, U.S. Patent 3,048,798, filed December 24, 1959, that had defined this key component for cable-based distribution of television. Now, 35 years later, he designed another coupler unit, U.S Patent 5,461,349, filed Oct. 17, 1994, a wide-band bidirectional coupler. He expanded on its concept with a proposal for a contemporary bidirectional hybrid copper and optical cable television headend, with a 1 GHz bandwidth and privacy capabilities.Simons K.

However, not only was he a contributor to cable television but he volunteered his unique knowledge to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in developing optical imaging systems for the detection of breast cancer and brain function. This deep knowledge and facile handiwork made possible the perfection of devices that are now the focus of new types of medical devices that make possible non-invasive and highly sensitive detection of brain function, muscle function and cancer detection. Simons will be long remembered for his generous and far-reaching knowledge of electronic circuits.

From the Chronique d'Angleterre of Jean de Wavrin. The Fernandine Wars (from Spanish and Portuguese Guerras Fernandinas) were a series of three conflicts (1369‚Äì70, 1372‚Äì73, 1381‚Äì82) between the Kingdom of Portugal under King Ferdinand I and the Crown of Castile under King Henry II. They were fought over Ferdinand's claim to the Castilian succession after the death of King Peter of Castile in 1369. Treaty of Salvaterra The Treaty of Salvaterra de Magos was an agreement signed in 1383 between Portugal and Castile in order to end a period known in Portugal as the Fernandine Wars (after the name of Fernando I). To celebrate the peace between the two kingdoms, king Fernando I of Portugal agreed on the marriage of his daughter and heir, Beatrice of Portugal, with king John I of Castile. However, to avoid the union of the two countries, this pre-nuptial agreement established the rules to the succession for the two thrones. It was never Fernando's intention to form a union of the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile. Therefore, it was agreed that following his death his wife, queen Leonor Telles de Menezes would assume the regency in Portugal until the son of Beatrice and John would reach 14 years old, when he would become the future king of Portugal. The main clauses of the Treaty of Salvaterra stipulated: *The separation between the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile only could be eliminated with the consent of the Cortes; *The recognition of Beatrice and her husband as kings of Portugal (him, as king consort), if Fernando I would die without any other male heir; *The succession in the throne of Portugal to the offspring of Beatrice and her husband; *The succession in the throne of Portugal to John of Castille and his offspring of the first marriage, if Beatrice would die childless before him, but the Portuguese naturals (property owners) must to receive him as their king; *That queen Leonor Telles de Menezes should remain regent of the kingdom if Fernando I would die without any other heirs and while Beatrice didn't have a 14-year- old son; *And other less important clauses (included in Chronicle of king Fernando I, by Fern√£o Lopes, Chapter CLVII). In the famous Cortes of Coimbra (1385), Jo√£o das Regras, a lawyer supporting John Master of Aviz claims to the throne of Portugal, defended that due to the disrespect to the Treaty of Salvaterra clauses, Beatrice and John I of Castile should be excluded from the throne.

In five matches he struggled with the ball and could only take one wicket at an average of 278 but scored two half centuries. The competition was then suspended due to the war so Watt never got a chance to improve his Shield record.

He was a son of James Samson and his wife Martha (Cooper), a sister of Ann, wife of Edward Tilley. Henry was noted in his father's 1638 will and was bequeathed five pounds.  Life in Leiden  Shortly after their marriage Edward Tilley and his wife went to live in Leiden, Holland. They appear in a 1616 Leiden record where he was reported to be a weaver as with a number of other Leiden Separatists, and future Mayflower passengers. There is an indication that Edward's brother John Tilley was also in Leiden along with Edward's ward Henry Samson. Voyage on the Mayflower Henry Samson, age about sixteen, boarded the ship Mayflower as a nephew of the Edward Tilley family, along with his cousin, one year old Humility Cooper. Why Henry was in the custody of the Tilleys is unknown ‚Äì it is possible he may have been apprenticed out to his uncle Edward Tilley. The reason that Humility and Henry were given over to the care of the Tilleys, apparently in Leiden, has never been fully explained. Henry's parents and siblings remained in Henlow, Bedfordshire.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), pp. 49, 79 Per William Bradford's later recollection of this family: \\"Edward Tillie, and Ann, his wife; and *2* children that were their cossens, Henery Samson and Humility Coper.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30‚àí40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbour at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7-19.

Henry was a volunteer in the Pequot War of 1637, but the war ended before the Colony could get its troops organized. On January 1, 1637/38, Henry and Ann were granted land in Duxbury next to Henry Howland. In April 1640, Henry was granted additional land that had formerly been common land. Starting in the 1640s, Samson began many years of public-service duties. He served on six juries between 1641 and 1663 and twelve petty juries between 1644 and 1670. In 1648 he was an arbiter, a surveyor in 1649 and in 1661, a constable for Duxbury. Between 1638 and 1654 Samson and his wife had nine children and in 1665 and 1667 he was allowed by the Plymouth Court to seek out land for his children. Sometime after 1668, Henry and his wife sold some of their land in Nemasket and would also sell of some of his Dartmouth properties in 1682 and 1684. In 1669 he served on a coroner's jury assembled by John Alden.Sampson, Lilla Briggs, The Sampson Family, (Baltimore, MD.: Williams & Wilkins Co., 1914)Wood, Henry Shepard Jr., Sampson,, Greenville, NC, 1993.

Distribution Pheropsophus aequinoctialis is the most widespread species in the genus Pheropsophus, with a distribution that stretches from Yucat√°n (Mexico) in the north to Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay and Catamarca and Jujuy provinces in Argentina in the south. Description As well as being the most widespread, P. aequinoctialis is also the most variable species in the genus. It has a similar colour pattern to the beetles Phaeoxantha aequinoctialis, P. klugii and Trichognathus marginipennis, and all these species probably form a M√ºllerian mimicry complex. Ecology The larvae of Pheropsophus aequinoctialis eat eggs laid by mole crickets of the genus Scapteriscus (S. vicinus pictured). Pheropsophus aequinoctialis adults are nocturnal, often hiding in groups during the day under stones, logs or clumps of grass, but emerging in the night to run along sandy trails or riverine beaches. In common with other members of the tribe Brachinini, they display a crepitating behaviour, and produce quinones. Adults of P. aequinoctialis sometimes feed on plant matter, such as the fruit of the palm Astrocaryum, but are generally predators, especially of adult mole crickets of the genus Scapteriscus. P. aequinoctialis has therefore been considered as a potential biological control agent to control Scapteriscus species. Three species of Scapteriscus (S. abbreviatus, S. borellii & S. vicinus) are adventive species in Florida, having arrived around 1900 from South America. The mole crickets' burrowing and the feeding by their adults and nymphs larvae cause significant damage to several grass species, including Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon, Eremochloa ophiuroides, Stenotaphrum secundatum, Zoysia spp. and Hemarthria altissima. =Life cycle= Pheropsophus aequinoctialis lays clutches of 25‚Äì60 eggs close to the burrows of mole crickets. The eggs are white and rectangular in outline, with rounded apices. The three instars (larval stages) which follow are white, with a cream head capsule, and darker colouration at the tips of the mouthparts. The first-instar larvae have long legs, and seek out the egg chambers within the mole cricket burrows. The second instar differs markedly from the first ‚Äì a phenomenon known as hypermetamorphosis; they are shorter and wider, with much shorter legs. The larva feeds on the eggs of the mole crickets, and remains in the burrow until it has moulted into the imago (adult state). The pupa is of the typical form in ground beetles. Taxonomic history Pheropsophus aequinoctialis was one of the first ground beetles to be described from the Neotropical realm. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1763 work Centuria Insectorum, under the name Cicindela aequinoctialis. It was also later described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775 as Carabus complanatus and by Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1795 as Carabus planus, both of which are junior synonyms of Pheropsophus aequinoctialis. It was later made the type species of the genus Pheropsophus. References Weed, A.S., Frank, J.H. 2005. Oviposition behavior of Pheropsophus aequinoctialis L.

The Castilian fleet commanded by Don Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar defeated decisively the Portuguese fleet led by Jo√£o Afonso Telo. The result of the battle was the destruction of the naval offensive capability of Portugal, achieving the Castilian naval supremacy in the Atlantic Ocean. Background Following the death of Peter I of Castile, Ferdinand I of Portugal declared war on the Kingdom of Castile for possession of the Castilian throne. This series of conflicts were known as the Ferdinand Wars. In 1381, breaking the Treaty of Santarem (1373) which brought peace to the second war, Ferdinand I retaliated against Castile, thus initiating the Third Ferdinand War.Batista Gonz√°lez. Espa√±a estrat√©gica Vol.6 For this, he signed an alliance with the young Richard II of England. John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, also had claims to the Castilian throne since 1371 and seeing in this deal a means of enforcement of his cause, sent about 2,000 English soldiers under the command of the Earl of Cambridge to Lisbon to support a Portuguese incursion into the Castilian territory. To prevent the English contingent being intercepted at sea by the navy of Castile, the Portuguese monarch planned a naval blockade. In mid-July 1381, a Portuguese fleet under the command of Jo√£o Afonso Teles de Menezes, 6th Count of Barcelos, sailed from Lisbon towards the mouth of the Guadalquivir river to prevent the passage of the Castilian fleet, which was anchored in Seville. At the same time, the fleet of Admiral Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar sailed from its base in Seville, heading out to the Portuguese coasts. On 17 July, sailing in opposite directions, the two fleets sighted each other off the Algarve. Battle of the Saltes Island After assessing the situation, Castilian Admiral Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar considered victory very unlikely under the circumstances and ordered the fleet to tack and return to port. His Portuguese counterpart saw an opportunity to beat the rival, and began pursuit of the Castilian fleet. De Tovar ordered to his men to row at a fast pace, forcing his Portuguese pursuers to match the effort to try to overcome the fleet. The different speeds at which they advanced increased the distance between the Portuguese ships, breaking their formation. After about two hours, exhaustion, thirst and the heat of summer took their toll on the Portuguese rowers, and many of their ships were left behind. Eight of them, the vanguard of the Portuguese fleet, attacked the small island of Salt√©s and destroyed the property of the fishermen in the vicinity. Seeing that the Portuguese had fallen into his trap, de Tovar launched his ships against the enemy in compact formation, and easily captured the Portuguese galleys. The rest of the Portuguese fleet approached in disarray one by one and were captured by the Castilians without difficulty.Fern√°ndez Duro 144‚Äì145 Eventually, only one of the 23 Portuguese galleys avoided capture. Consequences King John I of Castile. John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Admiral Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar entered triumphantly with his 22 galleys captured in the port of Seville, with great joy of its inhabitants. This fact allowed the English to dock in Lisbon without problems. Later, the English men of the Duke of Lancaster, arranged their boats to face off against the fleet of S√°nchez de Tovar, but knowing that he had returned to Seville, the English ships returned to England, leaving in Lisbon to the English land forces. The resounding victory of Don Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar had obvious implications for the Third Ferdinand War. Annulled the naval offensive capability of Portugal, achieving the Castilian naval supremacy in the Atlantic Ocean. That year, the Portuguese could not build more fleets against Castile, who, in turn, did not need to do the same, and the Castilians exercised an effective control of the sea. Therefore, the battle ended the naval Portuguese campaign of 1381. The effects of the Portuguese defeat also felt in the following year, when the Kingdom of Portugal had to face, militarily weaker than usual, a vigorous attack by sea and land from the Crown of Castile. The Castilians came to the gates of Lisbon, forcing the King of Portugal to sign peace in August with John I of Castile, by the Treaty of Elvas.

Description Pleuroncodes planipes is a bright red animal, up to long. It resembles a true lobster, but has a shorter abdomen. Taxonomic history Pleuroncodes planipes was first described by William Stimpson in 1860. In his description, Stimpson noted that P. planipes was very close to P. monodon, the only other species in the genus. Distribution Pleuroncodes planipes lives on the continental shelf west of Mexico. It is usually found only south-west of San Diego, but in warmer years, its range may extend northwards into California. This is usually indicative of an El Ni√±o event. Adults migrate vertically to near the ocean surface and large numbers occasionally wash up on beaches during warm water events. The southern limit of the species' range is in Chile. Life cycle The life cycle of Pleuroncodes planipes appeared for a long time to form a paradox: while an adult population was maintained along the south-western coast of the United States, the planktonic larvae they released were immediately swept by the California Current thousands of miles out to sea. A solution was proposed whereby the larvae use an opposing undercurrent at a lower depth to return to the continental shelf, and this hypothesis was confirmed by sampling different depths of water with a plankton recorder. Ecology Pleuroncodes planipes usually feeds on protists and zooplankton, but will feed by filtering blooms of diatoms. As the most abundant species of micronekton in the California Current, Pleuroncodes planipes fills an important ecological niche converting primary production into energy that larger organisms can use. P. planipes is accordingly an important food item for many species of birds, marine mammals and fish. It is favoured by tuna, leading to one of the species' common names ‚Äì \\"tuna crab\\". Other fish known to feed on P. planipes include billfishes, yellowtail amberjack, sharks and Epinephelus analogus. The diets of gray whales, Bryde's whales, blue whales and sea otters all include P. planipes. The Mexican endemic bat Myotis vivesi also feeds on P. planipes at some times of the year. Off Baja California, the stomachs of some loggerhead sea turtles have been observed to contain only P. planipes. Since P. planipes may be washed ashore in large numbers, it can be a valuable addition to the diets of seabirds such as the herring gull (Larus argentuatus), whose food supply is usually diminished in El Ni√±o years.

They allow software to be understood in terms of those categories. Instead of the particularities of each package. Different classification schemes consider different aspects of software. Computer Software Computer software can be put into categories based on common function, type, or field of use. There are three broad classifications: * Application software is the general designation of computer programs for performing tasks. Application software may be general-purpose (word processing, web browsers, etc.) or have a specific purpose (accounting, truck scheduling, etc.). Application software contrasts with system software. * System software is a generic term referring to the computer programs used to start and run computer systems including diverse application software and networks. * Computer programming tools, such as compilers and linker, are used to translate and combine computer program source code and libraries into executable RAMs (programs that will belong to one of the three said) =Copyright status= The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status: free software, open source software, public domain software, copylefted software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software. Free software Free software is software that comes with permission for anyone to use, copy and distribute, either verbatim or with modifications, either gratis or for a fee. In particular, this means that source code must be available. \\"If it's not the source, it's not software.\\" If a program is free, then it can potentially be included in a free operating system such as GNU, or free versions of the Linux system. Free software in the sense of copyright license (and the GNU project) is a matter of freedom, not price. But proprietary software companies typically use the term \\"free software\\" to refer to price. Sometimes this means a binary copy can be obtained at no charge; sometimes this means a copy is bundled with a computer for sale at no additional charge. Open source software Open-source software is software with its source code made available under a certain license to its licensees. It can be used and disseminated at any point, the source code is open and can be modified as required. The one condition with this type of software is that when changes are made users should make these changes known to others. One of the key characteristics of open source software is that it is the shared intellectual property of all developers and users. The Linux operating system is one of the best-known examples of a collection of open- source software. Copylefted software Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms ensure that all copies of all versions carry more or less the same distribution terms. This means, for instance, that copyleft licenses generally disallows others to add additional requirements to the software (though a limited set of safe added requirements can be allowed) and require making source code available. This shields the program, and its modified versions, from some of the common ways of making a program proprietary. Some copyleft licenses block other means of turning software proprietary. Copyleft is a general concept. Copylefting an actual program requires a specific set of distribution terms. Different copyleft licenses are usually ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù due to varying terms, which makes it illegal to merge the code using one license with the code using the other license. If two pieces of software use the same license, they are generally mergeable. Non-copylefted free software Noncopylefted free software comes from the author with permission to redistribute and modify and to add license restrictions. If a program is free but not copylefted, then some copies or modified versions may not be free. A software company can compile the program, with or without modifications, and distribute the executable file as a proprietary software product. The X Window System illustrates this approach. The X Consortium releases X11 with distribution terms that make it non- copylefted free software. If you wish, you can get a copy that has those distribution terms and is free. However, nonfree versions are available and workstations and PC graphics boards for which nonfree versions are the only ones that work. The developers of X11 made X11 nonfree for a while; they were able to do this because others had contributed their code under the same non- copyleft license. Shareware Shareware is software that comes with permission to redistribute copies but says that anyone who continues to use a copy is required to pay. Shareware is not free software or even semi-free. For most shareware, source code is not available; thus, the program cannot be modified. Shareware does not come with permission to make a copy and install it without paying a license fee, including for nonprofit activity. Freeware Like shareware, freeware is software available for download and distribution without any initial payment. Freeware never has an associated fee. Things like minor program updates and small games are commonly distributed as freeware. Though freeware is cost-free, it is copyrighted, so other people can't market the software as their own. Microsoft TechNet and AIS Software categories This classification has seven major elements. They are: platform and management, education and reference, home and entertainment, content and communication, operations and professional, product manufacturing and service delivery, and line of business. * Platform and management‚ÄîDesktop and network infrastructure and management software that allows users to control the computer operating environment, hardware components and peripherals and infrastructure services and security. * Education and reference‚ÄîEducational software that does not contain resources, such as training or help files for a specific application. * Home and entertainment‚ÄîApplications designed primarily for use in or for the home, or for entertainment. * Content and communications‚ÄîCommon applications for productivity, content creation, and communications.

History  The Aomatsuba Incident was an oppression of the Sabaku party (sabaku ha) that occurred in the Owari Domain from February 13 to 18, 1868. Immediately after returning to the Owari domain on the 13 of the same day, Tokugawa Yoshikatsu (Âæ≥Â∑ùÁæ©Âãù), the 14th lord of the domain, who had been doing political treatment after Taisei Hokan (Â§ßÊîøÂ•âÈÇÑ) at the Kyoto Imperial Palace, received an imperial order with charges of 'adultery' (Âß¶ÂæíË™ÖÈã§), and an oppression order was issued. The subjects were from senior vassals to general feudal retainers, with 14 decapitations and 20 punishments. There are various theories about the background of the imperial decree.https://samurai-world.com/nagoya-castles-aomatsuba-incident/ The name of the incident is derived from the Aomatsuba residence, which was the house of Watanabe Shinzaemon, one of the first to be executed. The residence was located just outside of Nagoya Castle‚Äôs soto-bori outer moat.https://samurai- world.com/nagoya-castles-aomatsuba-incident/ The process of the outbreak The Owari-Tokugawa family (Â∞æÂºµ), the Kishu Tokugawa family (Á¥ÄÂ∑û), and the Mito- Tokugawa family (Ê∞¥Êà∏), the three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family which were called Gosanke (Âæ°‰∏âÂÆ∂), were called Otsukegaro „ÄêÂæ°‰ªòÂÆ∂ËÄÅ„Äë. Otsukegaro was simply the Ometsuke„ÄêÂ§ßÁõÆ‰ªò„Äë of the lord of the domain dispatched from the Shogun (Â∞ÜËªç) family, and in Owari, the family of Naruse Hayato and the Takekoshi Hyobu Shoyu (Á´πËÖ∞ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞ëËºî) family were well known for their chigyo (Áü•Ë°å). The power was strong from the family that the load had to pay attention to, and the domain was naturally divided into the Naruse faction and the Takekoshi faction. Among them, tt was the Takekoshi group who continued to take closer positions to the bakufu government, and in the old days, Tokugawa Muneharu (Âæ≥Â∑ùÂÆóÊò•), the seventh lord, who was rebellious to the bakufu, was forced to retire. At the end of the Edo period, the domain was divided into 'Kintetsu Gumi (ÈáëÈâÑÁµÑ),' which advocated the Sonno-joi policy (Â∞äÁöáÊîòÂ§∑) (reverence for the emperor and the expulsion of barbarians), and 'Fuigo party,' which was a careless position, and the Naruse family was close to the Fuigo party. Incident In the first place, the Owari Tokugawa family was the family style of the retired emperor's family from the time of the domain Tokugawa Yoshinao (Âæ≥Â∑ùÁæ©Áõ¥), and since there was a rebel against the Tokugawa Shogunate family (Âæ≥Â∑ùÂ∞ÜËªçÂÆ∂) once again, Tokugawa Yoshikatsu (Âæ≥Â∑ùÁæ©Âãù), who became the 14th lord of the domain, also took the position of Sonno joi (the descent of the emperor and expelling the barbarians), and especially the Takekoshi family in advance of the reform of the domain administration since the arrival of Matthew C. Perry. They often opposed the Fuigo party. When Yoshikatsu retired due to the suppression of Tairo (Â§ßËÄÅ)Ii Naosuke (‰∫ï‰ºäÁõ¥Âºº), the Kintetsu Gumi fell down, and Takekoshi Hyobu shoyu took over the domain administration under the new lord Mochinaga (ËåÇÂæ≥), and after the Sakuradamon Incident (Ê°úÁî∞ÈñÄÂ§ñ„ÉéÂ§â), Takekoshi Hyobu Shoyu fell out, and Yoshikatsu went to the front of the domain while retiring, and went to the capital frequently with the Kintetsu Gumi to enter the government. Meanwhile, Mochinaga retired and Yoshikatsu's son, Yoshinobu (ÊÖ∂Âñú), became the lord of the domain, and Fuigo party be shelved. After Taisei Hokan, the Bakufu army was defeated in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi (È≥•ÁæΩ‰ºèË¶ã„ÉéÊà¶„ÅÑ) on January 27 and 29, 1868. When the news arrived in Nagoya, the conflict between the Kintetsu Gumi who insisted on the dispatch of troops and the Fuigo party, which was cautious about the dispatch of troops, deepened the conflict. At that time Yoshikatsu, who was in Kyoto, heard the situation from Yoshida Tomoyuki in Owari domain who was an Inspector(Áõ£ÂØü), who came to Kyoto on the way to Kyoto in as the form of Messaging Mamiya Masakazu who was castle owner. The government army, who won the battle of Toba Fushimi, appointed imperial Prince Ninna Ji no Miya ÔºàKomatsu-no-miya AkihitoÔºâ to Seii Taishogun [literally, \\"great general who suppressed the barbarians\\"] on January 28th, and issued an order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu on January 31st, but in the east of Nagoya there were many Bakufu Fudai daimy≈ç (Japanese feudal government headed by a Shogun), and Yoshinobu's counterattack was also considered, So he had been felt uneasy about passing the Army It was. On February 8th, the Imperial Court summoned Yoshikatsu and ordered the return of the imperial court to clean the supporters of the Sabaku party in the Owari domain, which was the key point of transportation, to persuade neighboring in Owari domain feudal lords to come to the imperial court. Yoshikatsu was a member of the Imperial family from early time, but it was in a position to consider the bakufu (as the head of the Tokugawa gosanke (the three privileged family of the Tokugawa clan), and it was natural that there were sabaku party in the domain, however, it was not possible to rebel against imperial order, and in the end of distress, he decided to purge the sabaku party (supporters of the Shogunate), and to Matsudaira Shungaku, {Tencho is a good vassal. Bakufu was his father and son. In the time of national calamity, if the father and the son's father are captured, They shall stand up for the righteousness of their servants..} \\" He said. Yoshikatsu left Kyoto on the order of imperial command, and stayed at Owari-ichinomiya on 12 February, and went to Nagoya Castle on the 13th. On the same day, Chief retainer Shinzaemon Watanabe Aritsuna (Ê∏°Ëæ∫Âú®Á∂±) was arrested. He was executed by beheading on 16 February.https://samurai-world.com/nagoya- castles-aomatsuba-incident/ In addition, 13 persons including Ooban Gashira (Â§ßÁï™È†≠), Sakakibara Kageyu (Ê¶äÂéüÂãòËß£Áî±), Oobangashira, Ishikawa Kuranosuke (Áü≥Â∑ùÂÜÖËîµÂÖÖ) were arrested and beheaded without a public explanation of the reasons. Yoshikatsu left the incident as an internal conflict in the Owari domain, and tried to forbid speaking feudal retainer of the domain. Also, For the reason of 'invite the relatives of emperor to the emperor,' he confirmed to the various domains of countries (Whether Imperial court side or betray the Imperial Court ) in six provinces in the Tomi, Kai, Suruga, Shinano, Mino, Shimotsuke on April 21st. Three chief commissioner of Owari branch under ruling Tokugawa clan were enacted when entering the Ninomaru gate in Nagoya Castle. At the end of Taish≈ç era in 1926, The stele was erected at the enactment point. The execution point is still uncertain, however it have been thought to occur about 100 meters south from the present point of the stele. The stele was reerected after the enactment point had got lost.https://samurai-world.com/nagoya-castles-aomatsuba-incident/ Cause of the incident At the time of the first conquest of the Choshu domain, Yoshikatsu, he was appointed to the post of chief of the expedition in the battle of it. The war was not fought, and the Choshu domain apologized, and three of the senior statesmen of Choshu domain and 11 retainers did Seppuku. After that, the government decided to Expedition, and organized two times. Shame of the Choshu domain, the second insult, and this grudge. In addition, it was the same as the Choshu clan, who was beheaded in the incident of 11 senior vassals and 11 Hanshi (retainers), who happened to committed Seppuku at the time of the first conquest. However, Yoshikatsu was openly opposed to the second conquest of Choshu, and it was not possible to explain how the Choshu domain, who had not been appointed to the three key posts, moved the imperial court only after the restoration.

When Henry II of Castile (Henry of Trastamara) died in 1379, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster claimed their rights of the throne of the Kingdom of Castile, and again found an ally in Ferdinand I of Portugal.Batista Gonz√°lez. Espa√±a estrat√©gica Vol.6 Anglo-Portuguese alliance In 1381, breaking the 1373 Treaty of Santarem, King Ferdinand I of Portugal decided to attack Castile, thus initiating the Third Fernandine War. For this, he signed an alliance with the Kingdom of England, ruled at that time by the young King Richard II of England. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, also had, since 1371, claims to the Castilian throne, and saw in this deal a means of enforcement of this cause. In June, the Duke of Lancaster sent an English army (composed by the famous English archers) under the command of the Earl of Cambridge to Lisbon in support of the Portuguese troops in an incursion into the Castilian territory. Naval Portuguese offensive To prevent the English contingent being intercepted at sea by the navy of Castile, the Portuguese monarch planned a naval offensive against the Castilian fleet, anchored in Seville. In July 1381, from Lisbon, a Portuguese fleet under the command of Jo√£o Afonso Telo, sailed towards the mouth of the Guadalquivir river, to prevent the passage of the Castilian fleet.Pereira p.141 At the same time, the Admiral Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar sailed from its base, heading out to the Portuguese coasts. The Portuguese fleet was decisively defeated by the fleet of Don Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar at the Battle of the Saltes Island, and the Castilian fleet obtained the total control of the Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile, the English troops disembarked in Lisbon without any problem. Castilian offensive of 1382 Fedinand I of Portugal, exhausted by war and by the constant defeats at the hands of the Castilians, began to rethink peace with Castile. In 1382, the Castilians, led by the King John I of Castile and the Admiral Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar, with a great and vigorous offensive by sea and land, came to the gates of Lisbon, finally forcing the King of Portugal to sign a favourable peace by the Castilians in August, with John I, by the Treaty of Elvas of 1382. Consequences King Ferdinand I of Portugal. King John I of Castile. The Castilians were victorious, and the Crown of Castile gained the military supremacy in the Atlantic Ocean. Under the conditions of peace stipulated that Beatrice of Portugal, the heiress of Ferdinand I of Portugal, married King John I of Castile. This union meant de facto annexation of Portugal to the Crown of Castile, but this treaty did not please the Portuguese nobility, and became the main cause of the future important crisis of 1383-1385. On October 22, King Ferdinand died. According to the marriage contract, dowager Queen Leonor Telles de Menezes assumed regency in the name of her daughter Beatrice and son-in-law, John I of Castile. Since diplomatic opposition was no longer possible, the party for independence took more drastic measures, starting the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis.

It is a small slow-moving fish, living in the surf zone of sandy or muddy beaches. Here it is easily caught as bycatch by shrimp fisheries and seine netters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being of \\"least concern\\". Description This species of ray has a near-circular body and a short tail. It grows to approximately long, and wide, with colouration ranging from dark brown to reddish orange. It has irregular rings, sometimes oval in shape. The ventral surface ranges from white to greenish. It has tooth rows that vary in number from 17 to 34 in each jaw. This depends on the size of the specimen. It has two electric organs, elongate in shape, that run from the front of the eyes, down to the rear end of the disc. These organs can generate a peak voltage of about 14 to 37 volts, which they use to stun prey and to defend themselves.

Habitat The lesser electric ray is most commonly found under sand or mud, in intertidal shallow waters, but has been found at depths of up to . Behavior This species is nocturnal. It remains motionless during the daytime, and forages for food in the substrate at night. It is a sluggish swimmer and maintains a territory in the surf zone of the beach.

is a Canadian television film directed by Rodney Gibbons and starring Matt Frewer and Kenneth Welsh. The film is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's 1902 Sherlock Holmes novel of the same name. Production The first of four Holmes adaptations starring Frewer as Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles was followed by The Sign of Four in 2001, then The Royal Scandal (a blend of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" and \\"The Bruce-Partington Plans\\") in 2001, with The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire (an original story) the final film released in 2002. Because of the duo's compatibility, they were asked to stay on for a sequel to the film. At the time of release, this was the sixth adaptation of Conan Doyle's 'Hound of the Baskervilles' story. The film was produced by Montr√©al-based production company Muse Entertainment and although both Frewer and Welsh had not read the original story, that did not deter the producers from hiring them on. The two actors were cast for the roles because of their previous theatre training experience. The film's budget was a generous $4.5 million, making it a step above most TV films. Most of the film's budget went into creating elaborate sets to capture the essence of the book's locations. Production designer Jean-Baptiste Tard had $600,000 to create 221B Baker Street as well as a facade for Baskerville Hall. The film was shot in Quebec, Canada, using the streets of Old Montreal to mimic Holmes' iconic Baker Street residence, and the streets of London, England. The nearby rural town of Harrington, Quebec was used as a stand in for the English moors near Henry Baskerville's home. The \\"hound\\" was a trained German Shepherd augmented with the use of contact lenses and CG.  Cast Matt Frewer as Sherlock Holmes *Kenneth Welsh as Dr. John H. Watson *Jason London as Sir Henry Baskerville *Emma Campbell as Beryl Stapleton *Gordon Masten as Dr. Mortimer *Robin Wilcock as Stapleton Reception Frewer's portrayal of Holmes was largely criticized.The Sherlock Holmes Collection (2000-2002) - DVD ReviewThe Sherlock Holmes CollectionThe Hound of the Baskervilles: A Thumbnail Review He has been described as an actor that is 'normally eccentric and rubber-faced', allowing critics to call his adaptation the 'Ace Ventura version of Sherlock Holmes'. Frewer's \\"manic quirks owe more to Jim Carrey than Basil Rathbone\\" said one critic. Going on, the actor's characterization has been called more gay, this stemming from what the critic called Holmes' \\"subliminal interest in the young and handsome Sir Henry Baskerville\\". In order to make his interpretation of Holmes stand out, Frewer decided to tap deeper into Holmes' genius side. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Frewer commented on his take of the infamous sleuth, saying, \\"I decided Holmes has these literal brainstorms. He can hardly keep up with his own ideas. His brain is working quickly but he's always hot this calm reserve and demeanour. So that's exactly how I decided to play him.\\" References  External links  Films based on The Hound of the Baskervilles 2000 television films 2000 films Canadian television films 2000 in Canadian television English-language films 2000s mystery films Canadian films Sherlock Holmes films ","title":"The Hound of the Baskervilles (2000 film)"},{"id":"30888986","text":"Brendan Moriarty (born 1989) is an American film director and producer.

Pritam Saha is BDO History =Gauda and Pandua= Gauda was once the ‚Äúcapital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.‚Äù During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, ‚Äúthe city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.‚Äù ‚ÄúPandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans‚Äù‚Ä¶ With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi‚Ä¶ the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal,,, Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. =Malda district= With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focussed on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with ‚Äúsome portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts‚Äù. A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Harishchandrapur II block, is located at . Harishchandrapur II CD Block is part of the Tal, one of the three physiographic sub-regions of the district. ‚ÄúThe Tal region gradually slopes down towards the south-west and merges with the Diara sub-region‚Ä¶ (it) is strewn with innumerable marshes, bils and oxbow lakes.‚Äù The sub-region largely remains submerged during the monsoons and during the dry season large sections of it turn into mud banks with many shallow marshes scattered around. With hardly any gradient the rivers crawl through the region. The Kalindri flows along the southern edge of the CD Block. Doulatnagar, Islampur and Bhaluka gram panchayats in Harishchandrapur II CD Block are vulnerable to floods from the adjoining Mahananda and Fulahar rivers.

The decadal growth of population in Harishchandrapur PS or Harishchandrapur I &II; CD Blocks taken together in 1991-2001 was 25.63%. The decadal growth of population in Harishchandrapur PS or Harishchandrapur I &II; CD Blocks taken together in 1981-91 was 29.30% and in 1971-81 was 25.13%.The decadal growth rate of population in Malda district was as follows: 30.33% in 1951-61, 31.98% in 1961-71, 26.00% in 1971-81, 29.78% in 1981-91, 24.78% in 1991-2001 and 21.22% in 2001-11.The decadal growth rate for West Bengal in 2001-11 was 13.93%. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93 in 2001-2011, 17.77% in 1991-2001.24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971-1981. Malda district has the second highest decadal population growth rate, for the decade 2001-2011, in West Bengal with a figure of 21.2% which is much higher than the state average (13.8%).Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal growth rate in the state with 23.2%.Decadal growth rate of population is higher than that of neighbouring Murshidabad district, which has the next highest growth rate. Population density in the district has intensified from 162 persons per km2 in 1901 to 881 in 2001 (i.e., around five times), which is highest amongst the districts of North Bengal. However, unlike the densely populated southern regions of West Bengal, urbanisation remains low in Malda district. North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, ‚ÄúMalda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.‚Äù There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border. Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Harishchandrapur II CD Block was 112,698 (54.34% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 61,732 (57.21% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 50,966 (51.23% of the female population over 6 years).

There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years.The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Muslims numbered 143,803 and formed 72.61% of the population in Harishchandrapur II CD Block. Hindus numbered 53,950 and formed 27.24% of the population. Christians numbered 86 and formed 0.04% of the population. Others numbered 200 and formed 0.11% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference.We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in Harishchandrapur II CD Block was 50.0%. Official surveys have found households living in absolute poverty in Malda district to be around 39%. According to the report, ‚ÄúAn overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Economy =Livelihood= In Harishchandrapur II CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 20,513 and formed 26.05%, agricultural labourers numbered 41,898 and formed 53.20%, household industry workers numbered 1,821 and formed 2.31% and other workers numbered 14,520 and formed 18.44%.

It serves as a transmitter facility for GMA's flagship stations: the main channel's DZBB-TV 7 (digital UHF 15), GMA News TV's DWDB-TV 27, and Barangay FM's DWLS 97.1 MHz.Pres. Aquino switched GMA-7's 'Power Tower, Manila Standard, November 7, 1988 History The Tower of Power was constructed on a huge vacant lot in the 3rd Quarter of 1987, as a new edifice for the network and for the preparation for Rainbow Satellite broadcast to replace an old surplus 50-kilowatt transmitter located at the old RBS building (now known as GMA Network Center) in EDSA, and to clear TV and FM reception. The tower's construction uses 600 tons of steel from a local steel mill, costing PHP 170 Million pesos for the building of this tower. Antennas are also provided to enhance signal strength. After several months of planning, the tower completed in October 1988 and on November 7, 1988, the tower was opened by then- President Corazon Aquino and the GMA Network board of directors. A grand TV special was started after the inauguration. The slogan GMA-7-POWER was used from November 7 to December 1, 1988 as a station ID. In 2005, following its signing of a channel lease agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network's flagship DZOE-TV 11, GMA replaced channel 11's decommissioned 40 kW transmitter in Pasig with a newly purchased 100 kW transmitter system built and installed by GMA. Since channel 7's technical staff is prohibited by law from operating channel 11 due to the fact that both stations are in the same VHF channel band, the Tower of Power site leased portions of its space to Zoe for its own technical team to operate and maintain channel 11's signal. ZOE's 14-year lease in the site ended in mid-2019 following GMA's decision not to renew the agreement amid the company's increasing lease payment obligations to channel 11's owners.  Features  =The tower= The Tower of Power uses its high- gain corner reflector antennas and UHF panel antennas to produce a wide coverage of Analog (VHF TV and UHF TV, using the NTSC format) and Digital (ISDB-T) TV reception in Metro Manila, Region 3 (Central Luzon) and 4-A (Calabarzon). It is including Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Tarlac, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Batangas, Cavite, Quezon, Aurora and Rizal in both grades A and B for the broadcasts of DZBB-TV and DWDB-TV. For FM radio, DWLS's signal strength utilized by a circular bay Jampro FM antenna provides listeners with clear FM reception of 25 kilowatts and to spread out in Metro Manila and nearby provinces as well. It also serves as a repeater of GMA News TV for transmissions in Cebu and Davao to relay Channel 27's programmes. =The transmitter facility= The transmitter facility houses television and FM radio transmitters for DZBB-TV, DWDB-TV and DWLS containing sets of transmitter equipment imported by Harris and RCA of the United States, and JVC of Japan. At the same time, the satellite downlink facility housed all satellite broadcasts directly to the United States and other countries to produce foreign programmes.

The rich biodiversity embraces a wetland, 624 plant species, 41 mammal species (including whales, dolphins and seals), 166 bird species, 30 reptile species and four amphibians. The reserve is one of the few City of Cape Town nature reserves where it is possible to find Mystromys albicaudatus (White-tailed Mouse) and Orycteropus afer (Aardvark). The holotype of Scelotes montispectus (Blaauwberg Dwarf Burrowing Skink) was collected within Blaauwberg Nature Reserve. There is also a population of Mystromys albicaudatus (white-tailed mouse) listed as endangered in the latest Red List of mammals of South Africa, as well as a total of eight Red List fauna species. Within the current 1,445 ha, there is evidence of early human occupation, with shell middens dating back approximately 15,000 years. The reserve also conserves the site of the 1806 Battle of Blaauwberg, when the British took possession of the Cape from the Dutch for the second time and retained ownership until South Africa‚Äôs independence. On Blaauwberg Hill, several buildings were constructed during World War II, including a radar station, a lookout and a mess room. Since the then Blaauwberg Conservation Area‚Äôs (BCA) inception, conservation in the area has progressed rapidly. Simple bollards in the coastal parking areas have stopped 4x4s from accessing and ultimately driving on the beach, and, already, the endangered vegetation has recovered and the Haematopus moquini (African black oystercatcher) has since returned. Illegal vehicles had not only endangered the vegetation and Haematopus moquini, but had destroyed a number of the shell middens. The conservation area is also used for recreational activities such as surfing, hiking, wind surfing, whale watching and picnics.

The toys are made from chenille. Pillow Pets were invented by Jennifer Telfer in 2003. They first gained success when Telfer personally sold the toys close to the Christmas season of that year. They would later become more successful through television advertising, where the company's famous slogan, \\"It's a pillow, it's a pet, it's a Pillow Pet!\\" was featured in every ad. Pillow Pets have been used for charitable fund raising. History In 2003, Jennifer Telfer was living in San Diego with her husband, Clint, and two sons. In an interview with CNBC, Telfer states that she came up with the idea of functional stuffed toys when her oldest son, then seven, flattened out one of his stuffed animals from sleeping with it often. She decided on a combination of a pillow and a stuffed animal as the concept for Pillow Pets. Telfer and her husband proposed a meeting with a plush manufacturer at a tradeshow in Las Vegas, and decided to wholesale the toys themselves through their company, CJ Products (CJ is a combination of their first initials). Following the meeting, the Telfers were prepared to sell the first toys. The first Pillow Pet was \\"Snuggly Puppy\\". In the Christmas season, Jennifer Telfer first sold Pillow Pets at mall kiosks, but failed to sell them all: \\"Every single parent would walk up, and their kids would love them. [The parents would] say, 'No, it's just another stuffed animal.' because they didn't know that it opened up to a pillow.\\" A few weeks later, Telfer discovered that the Pillow Pets were most profitable during the period after Christmas when they were almost sold out at home shows. She later ordered a container of 7,000 Pillow Pets, now in six different animal varieties, and sold all of them in three months. By the end of 2010, CJ Products earned $300,000 in gross sales. In 2009, CJ Products started using television advertising to promote the Pillow Pets. Commercials aired on children's cable channels such as Nickelodeon, and family-oriented networks such as Travel Channel. Partly because of the ads, gross sales of $7,000,000 were recorded at the end of 2009. Telfer recalled: \\"I didn't realize that we were gonna be at this level, or people would love my idea as much as I loved it.\\" In 2012, Dream Lite Pillow Pets were introduced, along with Glow Pets in 2013. Product A \\"Snuggly Puppy\\" dog pillow pet. Shown for reference An ordinary Pillow Pet is made with chenille fabric. Underneath it is a velcro strap. Given that it starts in pillow position, its strap fastens to the other side in order to transform it into a stuffed toy. If the strap is unfastened again, the Pillow Pet can again be used as a pillow. The original release of Pillow Pets included merely six varieties. Now, more than one hundred varieties of Pillow Pets have been sold by CJ Products. Current varieties range from scented to body pillow pets, they even have a North Dakota State University pillow pet available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets. Available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets that exist for MLB, NFL, NHL and NCAA sports teams. There are also themed Pillow Pets based on Disney characters. Stuffed toys based on Thomas the Tank Engine, Scooby-Doo, Dora the Explorer, and SpongeBob SquarePants were produced as well. Aside from different themed Pets, they offer a diverse range of different sized Pets. These different sizes range from 11 inches, 14 inches, 18 inches and even 30 inches. The largest of these pets are from their Jumboz Plush set. Pillow Pets even offer different styles such as BodyPillars which are elongated and Pet Beds. Pet Beds are BPA and Phthalates free. CJ Products has also licensed Pillow Pets for three English Premier League football clubs for release in September. Besides stuffed animals, other products bear the Pillow Pets name, such as blankets, slippers, hats, and print pajamas. Three Pillow Pets books and two board games are also available. In late October 2011, a Pillow Pets video game was released for Nintendo DS. Recently, Pillow Pets World online has been created, featuring interactive, Pillow Pet related games for children to play for free online. Charity work CJ Products are known for their charity work, as they have donated Pillow Pets to many causes. In addition to CJ Products, the public have also donated Pillow Pets to help others. =Indirect= In December 2010, Michele McFarland, a human resources worker for the Baltimore County Department of Social Services, and her family, all from Catonsville, Maryland, started a Pillow Pet drive to help children at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Their initial goal was to donate 200 toys, but they actually donated 250 Pillow Pets to the hospital in time for Christmas Eve. According to McFarland, residents of New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Georgia helped contribute. A year later, it was announced that McFarland aimed to donate even more Pillow Pets to five hospitals, including Johns Hopkins, by Christmas. She became affiliated with the Casey Cares Foundation and ordered 1,400 Pillow Pets to help the hospitals. Jacob McConahay (then seven) and his family accepted donations of Pillow Pets in the Riley Hospital for Children, in Indianapolis, where Jacob was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. An early childhood volunteer mentioned that Jacob's goal was 1,000 Pillow Pets. CJ Products had heard about Jacob's goal, and they committed to matching the number of Pillow Pets that he collected. McConahay's wish to help children in the Riley Hospital inspired students at China Grove Middle School in North Carolina to donate Pillow Pets to patients at the Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital. Jacob died on August 31, 2011. his family has collected over 140,000 Pillow Pets in his name. =Direct= Following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, CJ Products, The Today Show, and the American Red Cross, collaborated to support relief efforts. Pillow Pets announced that they would donate one dollar of every purchase of a Pillow Pet on their website, on March 17 and 18, 2011, to the American Red Cross. They also auctioned five Pillow Pets on the same days, and the money also went to the American Red Cross. Since 2008, Pillow Pets has collaborated with the Family Reach Foundation to help families of children to fight cancer. In September 2011, the foundation received a donation of 6,200 Pillow Pets and was able to generate thousands of dollars in funds. Carla Tardif, the Foundations' director of development and special programs, stated a consideration of initiatives to create more promotion of Family Reach's cause and raise charitable funds for families worldwide. \\"We applaud the tremendous amount of work being done by the Family Reach Foundation on behalf of [the] families,\\" Jennifer Telfer said. Counterfeits Some toy companies have taken advantage of Pillow Pets' popularity by manufacturing and selling counterfeits. CJ Products have been notified many times of impostor Pillow Pets. Telfer said: \\"It is priority one for us to protect our brand and deliver the high quality people have come to expect when they see the My Pillow Pets plush folding stuffed animals authentic tag.\\" In one case, in January 2011, Concord Toys International were accused of selling fake Pillow Pets. Their products were being sold in a warehouse in Queens, New York City and bore the label \\"Made in China.\\" Private detectives hired by CJ Products tracked the toys to the warehouse, where U.S. marshals seized 17,000 counterfeits. An injunction was signed preventing Concord from manufacturing any forgeries, and CJ Products are seeking punitive damages against the company. Awards and accolades Pillow Pets have won several awards for being a child-friendly product. In 2009, Stevanne Auerbach recognized the toy as one of the Best Vacation Toys. Also in 2009, Armin Brott of Mr. Dad awarded the product the Mr. Dad Seal of Approval for Father's Day. Pillow Pets were among toys on Toys R Us's 2010 'Hot Toy' list.

In its original form it consists of nearly six hours of rare archival footage shot over the course of thirty years. Since 1987 this complete version has only been available for viewing at a select few institutions (the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center in New York City and the Smithsonian). In 2008 the first three parts of Dehn's work, totaling two hours, were remastered and released on DVD by Dancetime Publications. Mura Dehn =Background= Dehn grew up in Russia and was trained as a ballet and modern dancer in the style of Isadora Duncan. She was exposed to jazz as a child but didn't think much of it until, at the age of 20, she saw Josephine Baker perform in Paris. She was thrilled with the vitality of the style: \\"Before, European couple dancing was very formal‚Äîtoo pleasing and too relaxed. But life was not like that. We needed something to energize us, to give us abandon. The Charleston gave us the spice of rhythm and syncopation.\\" She began to incorporate it in her work and even put on a jazz concert in Vienna in 1925. In 1930, seeking the homeland of jazz, Dehn immigrated to the United States. =Motivation= Shortly after arriving in New York City, Dehn stumbled upon the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, an influential hotspot of African-American social dance. The dancing she found there was unlike anything she had ever seen‚Äîall of the energy of jazz she had come to love in Europe, with a characteristically American ease of movement. After immersing herself in the scene, Dehn realized what a tremendous waste it would be if such exceptional dancing was not somehow preserved for future generations. This sense of purpose took her away from her own dancing and became her life's work. Looking back on the matter years later, Dehn mused that \\"I sacrificed my career to promote the tidal wave of black jazz, to film the greatest dancers of the Savoy.‚Ä¶ My contribution is to have assembled and preserved these dances as presented by their greatest exponents.\\" Summary =Organization= There are three parts to the publicly available version of the film, with a handful of chapters each. The original editing is preserved: Each chapter is prefaced with a short narration by Dehn to establish the setting and the performers while a list of the dances and styles to be shown is displayed. =Themes= Throughout the entirety of The Spirit Moves, Dehn let her footage of the extraordinary dancing speak for itself. Her brief introductions at the beginning of each chapter do not touch upon any sociocultural analysis or other personal feelings. However, in the biographical short film In a Jazz Way, filmed shortly before her death, Dehn revealed that she was always keenly aware of the dominant feelings in African- American society and their manifestations in dance. > The Savoy dances, the main thing of the dance of that time, of the 1930s, > was hope. They felt triumphant, they felt recognized. They felt that they > could, through dance, through music, earn a position of equality ... Bebop > was just the opposite. They found throughout during their work experience > that nothing was going to be given to them, that they weren't going to be > treated in the same way. Bebop is [them] turning their back on white > influence, breaking up couple dancing, breaking up all the movements. It > represented the broken up, disoriented, lost world in which they could only > rely upon themselves. Later, when questioned about the then-recent development of breaking (which she also documented), Dehn expressed her view that the style and its wild, athletic movements are a response to the pain and discomfort of growing up in the modern world. Contents =Part 1: Jazz dance from the turn of the century to 1950= When Dehn first began her undertaking in the early 1930s, she faced a dilemma. To properly frame the current state of African-American social dance, she needed to record examples of styles from as early as the 1900s. As is true today, social dance progresses quickly and much had changed in the intervening decades. Unable to find the older styles performed in any of the modern venues, Dehn enlisted a group of talented dancers from the Savoy Ballroom to give demonstrations in a studio setting and fill in the gaps. The same format was also used to showcase the modern styles of dance of the 1930s and 1940s. The result is a clean, clear presentation of five decades worth of innovation in social dance that abstracts out everything but the movement of the dancers. Due to the technical limitations of film at the time, a separate soundtrack was added after recording the visuals; It features music of the same style as what was performed to by the dancers, but not necessarily the same songs. Chapter 1 of this section focuses on Ragtime dances such as the Strut and Cakewalk, as well as Jazztime styles like the Charleston of the 1920s and the Jazz steps of the 1930s (e.g. Susie Q, Black Bottom, Shimmy). Chapter 2 is all about the Blues, featuring examples of the Rent Party, Shake Blues, and Gutbucket blues styles. Chapter 3 departs from the studio briefly to home in on practice sessions inside the Savoy: Trunky Doo, Big Apple, and Aerial Lindy are some of the styles demonstrated. =Part 2: Savoy Ballroom of Harlem 1950s= Dehn's familiarity with the Savoy Ballroom gave her the perfect setting to observe and record social dancing in its natural environment. Correspondingly, Part 2 consists of footage of the general public enjoying themselves on the dance floor. By a coincidence that could only have been deliberate, Leon James and Al Minns (two of the best Lindy Hoppers of the era) are in the crowd. Included is a dazzling recording of an aerial Lindy contest in which one of the two dancers is always in the air, with the role frequently switching between the man and woman. =Part 3: Postwar era, 1950s‚Äì1980s= When the Savoy Ballroom closed its doors for the last time in 1958, Dehn choose to depart Harlem as she continued her work. As a result, Part 3 was filmed at Public School 28 in Brooklyn and the Palladium in Manhattan. In it Dehn witnesses a complete revolution in Lindy Hop, from its fall out of popularity in the early 1960s to its revival in the mid-1980s. =Notable performers= Dehn captured performances by some of the most brilliant dancers of the age. The Spirit Moves includes footage of James Berry, Pepsi Bethel, Teddy Brown, Thomas King, Frankie Manning, Al Minns, Willa Mae Ricker, Sandra Gibson, Leon James, Scoby Strohman, and Esther Washington‚Äîamong many others.

Its objective is to connect existing isolated green spaces and create a more hospitable urban environment for pollinators like bees with a system of ecological corridors of flowering plants by using existing urban infrastructure such as curb space and rooftops. Pathways The Columbia Street pollinator pathway segment near downtown Seattle, Washington runs east- west from Nora's Woods to Seattle University. A planned extension connects north to Volunteer Park. Pollinator pathway native flower plot The first pollinator pathway () is located on Seattle, Washington's east-west Columbia Street, and connects Seattle University's campus on 12th Avenue to Nora's Woods on 29th Avenue away, crossing one third of Seattle's width. A second long official pollinator pathway is slated for Seattle's north-south 11th Avenue, connecting Seattle University's campus to Volunteer Park. The first segment of the pathway on Columbia Street, which Bergmann received grants from the City of Seattle, Northwest Horticultural Society, and Awesome Foundation to create, replaced a long, grass strip between the street and sidewalk with plants that could attract pollinators. The pathways are composed of individual plots of perennial native plant species on city-owned property, tended by local volunteers. Bergmann had a related installation, Portal to The Pollinator Pathway, at Seattle Art Museum's Olympic Sculpture Park in 2012. In 2014, she made presentations on the project at Frye Art Museum and Seattle Tilth. Certification Since late 2013, Bergmann has offered a certification program for new pathways to use the trademarked Pollinator Pathway name. Other cities Cities other than Seattle have explored the idea of connecting landscapes for pollinators. In 2008, about the same time the Seattle project was getting under way, the Canadian Pollination Initiative wrote a paper on a \\"pollinator park\\" concept to include \\"...right-of-way passages, including highways, power lines, gas lines and other maintained corridors can be designed in such a way that they serve as pollinator habitats.\\" In 2011, a New York author and artist Aaron Birk wrote an illustrated story, The Pollinator's Corridor, about a pathway connecting the city's landscape. =City‚Äìcitizen discussions= Several cities have used official means to initiate citizen discussions on their own pollinator pathways following Seattle's model, including Redmond, Washington; the Niagara Falls, New York area; and Los Angeles, California via the mayor's blog. Awards In 2012, Bergmann received The Stranger's Genius Award and Seattle Art Museum's Betty Bowen Award for the project. In 2013, she was named one of Seattle's most influential people of the year by Seattle Magazine, along with recipients of the award who had created other Seattle area pollinator conservation projects.

This period commenced with the defeat of Carthage by the Roman Army, assisted by Berber cavalry led by Masinissa at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, and it lasted until the year 40 AD, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Gaius, also known as Caligula (37‚Äì41 AD). During the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC) Rome entered into an alliance with Masinissa, the son of a Berber tribal leader. Masinissa had been driven out of his ancestral realm by a Carthage-backed Berber rival. Following the Roman victory at Zama, Masinissa (r. 202‚Äì148 BC) was celebrated as a \\"friend of the Roman people\\". He became king of Numidia and ruled for over fifty years. For seven generations his line of kings continued its relationship with an increasingly powerful Roman state. During this era, the Berbers ruled over many cities as well as extensive land, and the peoples under their governance prospered. Municipal and civic affairs were organized using a combination of Punic and Berber political traditions. One descendant king, a grandson of Masinissa, Jugurtha (r. 118‚Äì105 BC), successfully attacked his cousin kings, who were also allies of Rome, and in the course of a long struggle he became an enemy of Rome. In the Roman civil wars after the fall of the Roman Republic (44 BC), Berber kings were courted by the contending political factions for their military support. Berber kings continued to reign, but had become merely clients of Imperial Rome. One such Berber king married the daughter of Cleopatra of Egypt. He and his son, the last two Berber kings (reigns: 25 BC‚Äì40 AD), were not accepted by many of their Berber subjects. During this period, Roman settlers were increasingly taking the traditional pasture lands of transhumant Berber tribes for their own use as farms. The commoner Tacfarinas raised a revolt in defense of Berber land rights and became a great tribal chief as a result of his insurgency (17-24 AD) against Rome.For the geography of Tunisia and other background, see History of Tunisia.For reference sources, see the footnoted sections that follow. Rome and the Berber kings In the third and final Punic war (149‚Äì146 BC), Roman forces lay siege to the great city of Carthage. When it fell to the Romans the great city had become mostly a burning ruin, and the long rivalry between the two major powers of the western Mediterranean came to an end. Rome annexed Carthage and its immediate vicinity, but the surrounding territories remained in Berber hands, specifically in those of King Masinissa, an ally of Rome. Subsequent independent Berber kings were courted by Rome. Previously, Carthage had enjoyed fabled wealth through commerce.Theodor Mommsen writes of the ancient city-state: \\"From a financial point of view, Carthage held in every respect the first place among the states of antiquity.... Polybius calls it the wealthiest city in the world.\\" Romische Geschicht (Leipzig 1854‚Äì1856) at Bk. III, Ch. I, [Par. 22]; translated as The History of Rome (London 1864; reprint London: Dent 1911) at II: 17‚Äì18. Accordingly, the Punic city-state had once exerted great economic influence on the surrounding Berber polities and peoples. Yet Carthage directly ruled only an ample territory adjacent to the city and its developed network of trading posts. These Punic enclaves were situated at short intervals along the Mediterranean coast of Africa from Tripolitania westward.Carthage had also directly ruled in various Mediterranean islands and in lands of Hispania, but these were already lost as a result of the Second Punic War. Although within a commercial sphere dominated by Carthage, most Berbers lived in territories outside its direct political control. Berber Kingdoms of Sfax and Gaia, west of Carthage, c. 220 BC, before the Second Punic War. Comparatively little is known of the most ancient Berber peoples since the few surviving writings from Carthage shed little light on this history, although surviving inscriptions and artifacts do offer some clues and hints. Starting with the Punic Wars, Berbers are, however, mentioned in surviving works of classical Greek and Roman authors and these sources provide some details in the descriptions of Berber events.Cf. Abdallah Lauroui, in his L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghreb. An Interpretive Essay (Princeton University 1977), 30. During the three Punic Wars, Rome directly entered into permanent relations with the Berber people. In the third war's aftermath, however, Rome turned its attention to the eastern Mediterranean. The fall of the Roman Republic led to the Roman civil wars, whose intermittent military actions and political strife indirectly amplified the significance of the Berber kings. Amid the oscillating demands and shifting fortunes, Berber alliances were sought by rival Roman factions. Berber relations with Rome became multivalent and fluid, characterized variously as a working alliance, functional ambivalence, partisan hostility, veiled maneuvering, and fruitful intercourse. Nevertheless, during these years of Roman civil conflict the political status of the Berber kings continued to erode. From being independent sovereign (Masinissa), the kings had become long-term allies; later their political alliance was required, and eventually they were reduced to Roman clients.Berber leaders are called \\"princes\\". E.g., Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Paris 1970; Princeton Univ. 1977), 30. When the last of these civil wars came to an end and the long reign of Augustus (31 BC to 14 AD) commenced, Roman-Berber relations were redefined. Berber kings reigned alongside a triumphant Roman dominion which spanned the entire Mediterranean, and later in 40 AD the last allied Berber kingdom was absorbed by the Empire. Thereafter, probably most Berber peoples lived within the political boundaries of the Roman world.Cf. Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971), 30‚Äì36. Nature of the Berber regimes Circa 220 BC, three large Berber kingdoms had arisen. Markedly influenced by Punic civilization, they had nonetheless endured as separate Berber entities, their culture surviving throughout the long reign of Carthage. West to east these kingdoms were: (1) the Mauri (in modern Morocco) under king Baga; (2) the Masaesyli (in northern Algeria) under Syphax, who then controlled two capitals: to the west Siga (near modern Oran) and to the east Cirta (modern Constantine); and (3) the Massyli (south of Cirta, west and south of nearby Carthage), ruled by Gala [Gaia] (the father of Masinissa). Following the Second Punic War, Massyli and eastern Masaesyli were joined to become Numidia, located in historic Tunisia. Here Masinissa ruled and reigned. Both Rome and the Hellenic states gave Masinissa the honors befitting an admired king.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 24‚Äì27 (kingdoms). > \\"Hitherto, the African kingdoms had been temporary tribal coalitions; > Masinissa did not wish to be a tribal chieftain, but a true king, with > settled subjects, with a proper army and a fleet financed by taxes rather > than by irregular and erratic tribal contributions.\\"Susan Raven, Rome in > Africa (London: Evans Brothers 1969; new ed., London: Longman 1984), 47. Many prosperous cities were governed by the Berbers. A bilingual (Punic and Berber) urban inscription has been found that concerns 2nd-century-BC Numidia. It was excavated from the ancient city of Thugga (modern Dougga, Tunisia), located about 100 kilometers inland from Carthage. The inscription indicates a complex city administration, with the Berber title GLD (cognate to modern Berber Agellid, king or paramount tribal chief) designating the ruling municipal officer. This top position apparently rotated among the selected members of the leading Berber families. Since the Numidian titles of the offices mentioned (GLD, MSSKWI, GZBI, GLDGIML) were not translated into Punic but left in a Berber language, it suggests an indigenous development.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 37‚Äì40 (Berber urban offices). These municipal titles were written using letters that represent only the consonant sounds, i.e., without indicating the vowel sounds, a characteristic also of ancient Phoenician and other Semitic scripts, such as Aramaic.Subsequently, Hebrew and Arabic indicate the vowel sounds by the addition of \\"diacritical points\\" usually placed above the letters.

Masinissa and Syphax The Berber king Masinissa (c. 240‚Äì148 BC)Livy (59-A.D.17), Ab urbe condita at XXIV, 48; Books XXI-XXX translated by Aubrey de S√©lincourt, edited by Betty Radice, as The War with Hannibal (Penguin 1965, 1972) at 290. Here the modern edition's footnote makes Masinissa ten years older than his age in Livy's text, giving him a birth date circa 240. was both well known and well regarded in Rome for many decades. He was the first and the most important of the early Berber leaders to establish major relations with the Roman state. His family became, what may be considered, the royal family of Numidia and its vicinity for eight generations: the House of Masinissa.Masinissa is discussed by Mouloud Gaid in his Aguellids et Romains en Berberie (Alger: Sned 1962; 2d ed. Alger: Opu 1985). Gaid (at 24) provides a diagram including the Kings of Numidia, which may also be called the \\"House of Masinissa\\": *Kings of Numidia (with dates of reign) {relation (to Masinissa by default)}, and events [sources] Zilassan {grandfather}, not yet King of Numidia, but a local Sufete [Brett & Fentress (1996), 39] Ga√Ø (died 208) {father}, King of Numidia [Brett & Fentress (1996), 39] Ousalces (died 207) {uncle (brother to Ga√Ø)}, [Brett & Fentress (1996), 289, n70 (text on p. 48)] Capusca (r. 207‚Äì207) {cousin (son of Ousalces)}, [Brett & Fentress (1996), 289, n70 (text on p. 48)] Lacumaces (r. 207‚Äì202) {cousin}, under regency of Mazaetullus, rival to Ga√Ø (mostly ruled by his rival Syphax) [Livy, XXIX, 29‚Äì32] Masinissa (r. 202‚Äì148), King of Massyli & Masaesyli (see Syphax below) [Ilevbare, Carthage, Rome & the Berbers (1980), 175] Micipsa (r. 148‚Äì118) {son}, [Sallust, 5-6] Gulussa (r. 148‚Äìc.140) {son}, died of disease [Sallust, 5‚Äì6] Mastanabel (r. 148‚Äìc.140) {son}, died of disease [Sallust, 5‚Äì6] (Misag√®nes, Masgaba, Stembanos {other sons}; Asdrubal {daughter}) Hasdrubal the Boeotarch (c. 149) {grandson}, commander of Carthage during Roman siege [Scullard (1935, 1991), 311] Adherbal (r. 118‚Äì112) {grandson (by Micipsa)}, killed at Cirta by Jugurtha [Sallust, 5‚Äì6, & 25] Hiempsal I (r. 118‚Äì116) {grandson (by Micipsa)}, killed at Thirmida by Jugurtha [Sallust, 5‚Äì6, & 13] Jugurtha (r. 118‚Äì105) {illegitimate grandson (by Mastanabel)}, [Sallust, 5‚Äì6] Massiva (died 110) {grandson (by Gulussa)}, killed at Rome by Jugurtha, as potential rival [Sallust, 35] Gauda (r. 105) = {grandson (by Mastanabal, half-brother to Jugurtha)} [Sallust, 65] Oxynta Hiempsal II (r. 106‚Äì60) {great-grandson (by Gauda via Mastanabal)}, deposed by Hiarbas (82-80), restored by Pompey (80) [Brett & Fentress (1996), 43] [Ilevbare (1980), 175] Juba I (r. 60‚Äì46) {great-grandson (by Hiempsal II)}, defeated in Roman civil war at Battle of Thapsus in 46, Numidia in 46 being annexed to Rome by Julius Caesar [B&F; (1996), 43] *Kings of Western Massyli and Masaesyli (\\"western Numidia\\") Syphax (deposed 203), circa 205 had annexed Massyli [Ilevbare (1980), 175] (see above: Masinissa; Micipsa, Gulussa, Mastanabel; Adherbal, Hiempsal, Jugurtha) Harba (r. 108‚Äì81) Mastenisa (r. 81‚Äì48) Arabion (r. 80‚Äì40) *Kings of Mauretania (west of Numidia) Baga (during Second Punic War (218‚Äì201)) {evidently not related to Masinissa} [Ilevbare, Carthage, Rome & the Berbers (1980), 175] Bocchus I (circa 105 [118‚Äì81]) {father-in-law to Jugurtha, evidently not related to Masinissa} [Sallust, 81] [B&F; on p. 42] [Ilevbare, 175] Bogud I (80‚Äì50, of western Mauretania) {brother of Bocchus I, evidently not related to Masinissa} [Ilevbare (1980), 175] Bocchus (Sosus) (80‚Äì50, of Eastern Mauretania) {evidently not related to Masinissa} [Ilevbare (1980), 175] Bogud II (50‚Äì38, of Western Mauretania) {evidently not related to Masinissa} [Ilevbare (1980), 175] Bocchus II (50‚Äì33) {evidently not related to Masinissa} died c.33, willed his kingdom to Rome [Brett & Fentress (1996), 43] Juba II (r. 25 BC ‚Äì 23 AD) {great, great great-grandson (by Juba I)} installed by Augustus as client king of Rome [B&F; (1996) 43] Ptolemy (r. 23‚Äì40) {great, great, great great-grandson (by Juba II)} unpopular, killed by Caligula [Brett & Fentress (1996), 43, 47] (Mauretania was annexed by Rome in A.D. 40, and made a Roman Province in 43) A bilingual inscription (in Punic and Libyan) from the city of Thugga, made a few years after his death, commences: > \\"The citizens of Thugga have built this temple to king Masinissa, son of the > king Gaia, son of the sufete Zilasan, in the year ten of Micipsa.\\" Here the > office translated to \\"king\\" was written GLD (cognate with modern Berber > \\"agellid\\" [paramount tribal chief]).

Masinissa served as a young cavalry commander for Carthage in Hispania during the early years of the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC). There, he met discreetly with the Roman general Scipio and eventually sided with Rome. On the death of his father, King Gala [Gaia], Masinissa sailed home to Massyli, where he fought for the throne against usurpers. A neighboring Berber king Syphax invaded the kingdom, but Masinissa escaped to continue his struggle from the outlying farmlands and mountains. When Scipio's armies later landed in Africa, Masinissa and his cavalry joined them. At the Battle of Zama in 202, Masinissa led Numidian and Italian cavalry on the right wing of the Roman forces. During the battle, his cavalry engaged in fighting disappeared from Scipio's view, but at a crucial moment suddenly reappeared, attacking the Punic forces and gaining victory. Hannibal's defeat here ended the long conflict.H. H. Scullard, A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC (London: Methuen 1935, 4th ed. 1980; reprint: Routledge, London 1991), 237. The Roman writer Livy (59 BC ‚Äì 17 AD) in his history of Rome, Ab urbe condita, devotes a half-dozen pages to Masinissa's character and career, both turbulent and admired, eventful and long in duration.Livy, his Ab urbe condita [History of Rome from its Foundation] at XXIX, 29‚Äì34; Books XXI‚ÄìXXX translated as The War with Hannibal (Peguin 1965, 1972), 604‚Äì612 (digression). Livy writes: \\"Since Masinissa was by far the greatest of all the kings of his time and rendered much the most valuable service to Rome, I feel that it is worthwhile to digress a little in order to tell [his] story....\\"Livy, Ab urbe condita at XXIX, 29; translated as The War with Hannibal (Penguin 1965, 1972), p. 604. Livy informs us of Masinissa's early military services to Carthage and of his and Carthage's victory over the Masaesyli led by Syphax. Next in Hispania, Masinissa led cavalry units for Carthage against Rome. Here he switched sides to ally with Rome, after meeting with Scipio Africanus, the celebrated Roman general. There followed the death of his father Gala, King of the Massyli, upon which he returned home to find an usurper taking over his father's kingdom. Masinissa then became a guerilla chief in the mountains of Africa, regaining his kingdom after a persistent struggle. Sooner after, Syphax staged an invasion, defeating Masinissa and seizing the Massyli kingdom with Masinissa escaping into the bush. Later, his forces came upon the army of Scipio, recently landed in Africa. The Romans defeated Carthaginian forces in battle and Syphax was captured. Masinissa sends envoys to Rome who meet with the Senate. Carthage was forced to recall Hannibal from Italy to defend the African capital. Nearby, Hannibal fought the Battle of Zama (202 BC) against Scipio's Roman army, with Masinissa at the head of cavalry on Scipio's right flank. Following victory over Hannibal, Masinissa was restored to his kingdom, Massyli along with surrounding Numidia, where he ends up ruling for fifty years.Livy, The War with Hannibal (Penguin 1965, 1972), 290‚Äì291, 340 (with Carthage against Syphax, and against Rome in Spain), 455 (his nephew captured and released by Scipio), 519, 543‚Äì545 (Masinissa and Scipio), 604‚Äì612 (from his father's death to Scipio's early victory), 632, 640 (Syphax captured, the Roman Senate), 661‚Äì663 (the Battle of Zama). That the Roman author Livy admired Masinissa is clear from his many favorable comments about the Berber king (constantissima fides). A modern Latin scholar summarizes as follows, citing Livy's Ab urbe condita: > \\"Masinissa is in fact a foreigner with almost all the Roman virtues. He is > religious, for he tells Scipio that he was awaiting any chance to [leave > Carthage for Rome] which 'the kindness of the immortal gods offered'. As a > general he shows forethought, but also boldness. At Scipio's command, he > controls his wayward passions by administering poison to Sophoniba [wife of > Syphax]. Above all, his valour is conspicuous; even at age ninety-two, just > before the Third Punic War, he leads his army to defeat the Carthaginians. > Masinissa is one of Livy's great heroes, and throughout the fourth decade > [Livy's books XXX to XL] he is mentioned in speeches as an example to the > peoples of the East of all that a king-ally should be. Hasdrubal is made to > say: 'There is greater talent of nature and mind in Masinissa that in any > previous member of his race.' And Livy calls him 'by far the greatest king > of his day'.\\"P. G. Walsh, Livy. His Historical Aims and Methods (Cambridge > University 1961; reprint: Bristol Classical Press 1989), 87. Regarding Sophoniba, her story provides a perspective on the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia).The ancient names of these two regions may simply refer to the west and the east of Numidia. Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (Oxford: Blackwell 1996), 26. Her story also sheds light on the relationship between Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC ‚Äì 17 AD), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions of what might have happened.Cf. P. G. Walsh, Livy. His Historical Aims and Methods (Cambridge University 1961; reprint: Bristol Classical Press 1989), chapter II \\"The traditions of ancient historiography\\", 20‚Äì45. The Death of Sophonisba, by Giambattista Pittoni. Sophoniba was the young and beautiful daughter of Hasdrubal Gisco, a leading general of Carthage. To secure the allegiance of the Berber kingdom of Massyli, she was pledged to Masinissa, but when he turned to Rome she was given instead to his rival, the Berber king Syphax of neighboring Masaesyli, for a similar purpose. Syphax then invaded Massyli, forcing Masinissa to flee. As the Second Punic War neared its climax (which would be at Zama), Scipio landed his Roman armies in Africa, where Masinissa joined him. Syphax was quickly defeated, with Masinissa triumphant.This occurs before the decisive Battle of Zama, where Scipio with Masinissa will defeat Hannibal. Here Sophoniba's attentions win the affection of Masinissa and his allegiance; he quickly marries her, to present the Romans with a fait accompli. Days later Scipio persuades him that the politics of the Rome‚ÄìCarthage conflict make his marriage to Sophoniba impossible;Here, an oblique reference to Homer's poem the Iliad may be suggested, to the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon over the young woman Briseis. Homer, The Iliad, Book I, in translation by E. V. Rieu (Penguin 1950), 23‚Äì39. she must be taken to Rome. Sophoniba tells Masinissa that the bond between Carthaginian and Berber, both of Africa, is against Rome. Reluctantly accepting that their marriage must end, she pleads with him that she not be humiliated. Masinissa agrees and gives her poison, which she takes.Livy (59 BC ‚Äì 17 AD), his Ab urbe condita [History of Rome from its Foundation] at XXX, 12‚Äì15, also XXIX, 29‚Äì34, and XXX, 8‚Äì16; Books XXI‚ÄìXXX translated as The War with Hannibal (Peguin 1965, 1972), 633‚Äì637, also 604‚Äì612, and 626‚Äì638.Cf. Polybius (c.200‚Äì118), The Histories XIV, 1 & 7, translated in part as The Rise of the Roman Empire (Penguin Books 1979), 452 and 461. Hers may be compared to Dido's suicide 650 years earlier, but there Dido died to avoid marriage to the Mauretani Berber leader Hiarbus. Here, however, Sophoniba married first Syphax, then Masinissa; it was not the Berber husband she refused; she rejected the ordeal of being paraded in a Roman triumph.Cf. Soren, Khadar, Slim, Carthage (1990), 18‚Äì19, 28, 120, 242. A modern historian characterizes Masinissa, noting in particular his \\"tremendous ideal\\" of uniting the Berber peoples, which motivated many of his actions during his long reign: > \\"Masinissa, who was thirty-seven years old at Zama, preserved his vigour > into a ripe old age: at eighty-eight he still commanded his army in battle, > mounting his horse unaided and riding bareback. But he had other outstanding > qualities besides physical vigour. Fearless and unscrupulous, diplomatic and > masterful, he conceived the tremendous ideal of welding the native tribes of > North Africa into a nation. He successfully developed agriculture and > commerce, and encouraged the spread of Punic civilization. His fame soon > exceeded the confines of Africa; he cultivated relations with the Greek > world, and at Delos at least three statues were erected in his honour. > Throughout he remained a faithful ally of Rome....\\"H. H. Scullard, A History > of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC (London: Methuen 1935, 4th ed. 1980; > reprint: Routledge, London 1991), 307. The isle of Delos was long famous as a cultural center of Ancient Greece, where its deities and acclaimed mortals were honored. The three statues of Masinissa at Delos mentioned in the above text were erected on behalf of the kingdom of Bithynia in Anatolia, the isle of Rhodes, and the city of Athens. The Numidian king Masinissa was \\"treated, by the Romans as well as the Carthaginians, with all the honour due to Hellenistic monarchs.\\" \\"He was a hero on a large scale.\\" \\"As an established king, [Masinissa] carefully cultivated the image of the perfect Hellenistic monarch through his coinage and the participation of at least one of his sons in the Panathenaic games.\\"Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (Oxford: Blackwell 1996), 27. After the Battle of Zama (202 BC), Masinissa became famous and was held in high esteem as a friend of the Roman people. For over fifty years he ruled as King of Numidia (lands west of Carthage) until his death in 148 BC.S. A. Handford, \\"Introduction\\", 29, to his translation of Sallust, The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1963).Following Zama (202) Rome allowed Masinissa rule over Numidia, i.e., to take the lands of the defeated Berber king Syphax and to recover any other lands Masinissa or his ancestors had once possessed. H. H. Scullard, A History of the Roman World. 753 to 146 BC (London: Methuen 1935, 4th ed. 1980; reprint: Routledge, London 1991), 307‚Äì308. During his reign farming and trade prospered, and the vital pulse of Berber culture quickened. Government institutions were established, evidently having an independent Berber origin, although informed by Punic civil traditions; indeed, Masinissa encouraged the cultural influence of Carthage. \\"The state, the life of the cites, art, religion, writing‚Äîall underwent a rapid process of Punicization.\\"Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib. An Interpretive Essay (Princeton University 1977), 52. The language used at court was Punic. \\"He successfully developed agriculture and commerce, and encouraged the spread of Punic civilization.\\"Scullard, A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC (1935, 4th ed. 1980; 1991), 307. Constantine (Algeria). Masinissa also cultivated a grand vision of uniting all the Berbero-Libyan peoples from the frontiers of Egypt to the Atlantic. His expansionist actions were directed mainly against the surviving city-state of Carthage. Eventually Masinissa's aggressive actions achieved several major acquisitions of lands previously held by Carthage, not only at the borders of Numidia and Carthage, but extending also well south of Punic territory, and including Mediterranean seaports in Tripolitania to the east of Carthage. Indeed, his last war against Carthage turned out to be a prelude to the Third Punic War (149‚Äì146 BC). Here, Rome intervened and eventually besieged and destroyed Carthage.Jamil M. Abun- Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge University 1971), 28,29.Scullard, A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC (1935, 1980, 1991), 307,308.H. L. Havell, Republican Rome (London: George G. Harrap 1914; reprint: Oracle 1996), 316‚Äì317. A not altogether novel view was that \\"Rome destroyed Carthage to prevent Masinissa from seizing it and becoming a Mediterranean power.\\"Laroui, The History of the Maghrib. An Interpretive Essay (Paris 1970; Princeton University 1977), 54. Confronting with the Roman siege, Carthage entrusted the defense of the city to Hasdrubal, a grandson of Masinissa. Accordingly, suspicions arose among the Romans about the role of the elderly yet still able king, now in his nineties. > \\"Masinissa caused slight anxiety. It was a grandson of his that was > organizing the defense of Carthage, and the king himself, who saw the fruits > of his ambitions now snatched from his grasp, was somewhat cold when asked > for assistance; when later he proffered it, he was told abruptly that the > Romans would let him know when they needed help.\\"Scullard, A History of the > Roman World, 753 to 146 BC (1935, 1980, 1991), 311‚Äì312. The ancient Numidian king died during this Third Punic War. The Greek historian Polybius (c. 200‚Äì118 BC) praised him highly in his Histories, in a text that might be regarded as an obituary for the celebrated Berber leader: > \\"Massanissa, the king of the Numidians in Africa, one of the best and most > fortunate men of our time, reigned for over sixty years, enjoying excellent > health and attaining a great age, for he lived till ninety.... And he could > also continue to ride hard by night and day without feeling any the worse. > [When] he died, he left a son of four years old... besides nine other sons. > Owing to the affectionate terms they were all on he kept his kingdom during > his whole life free from all plots and from any taint of domestic discord. > But his greatest and most godlike achievement was this. While Numidia had > previously been a barren country thought to be naturally incapable of > producing crops, he first and alone proved that it was as capable as any > other country of bearing all kinds of crops.... It is only proper and just > to pay this tribute to his memory on his death.\\"Polybius, The Histories, > XXXVI, 16, a fragment translated in The Histories of Polybius (Loeb > Classical Library 1927), volume VI, 381. Yet Polybius continues: \\"Scipio arrived in Cirta two days after the king's death and set everything in order.\\" This closing remark might be interpreted as a sign of the great affection and care given this long-term friend of Rome, or merely as an important Roman politician-soldier's prudent attention to state interests after the death of an important ally in time of war, or both. Livy gives the Roman view of the king's character when he imagines Hasdrubal saying of the young Numidian: \\"Masinissa was a man of far loftier spirit and far greater ability than had ever been seen in anyone of his nation....he had often given evidence to friends and enemies alike of a valour rare amongst men.\\"Livy, Ab urbe condita, XXIX, 31, translated in part as The War with Hannibal (London: Penguin 1965, 1972), 606. This Hasdrubal was the son of Gisco, the father of Sophoniba, and a military leader in Carthage during the Second Punic War; here he was said to be speaking to the Berber King Syphax, Masinissa's early rival. Micipsa, Jugurtha, Hiempsal Northern Africa during the late Roman Republic. Top map, east to west: initial borders of Africa Province, Numidia, Mauritania, Tingitania. Micipsa, Mastanabal, and Gulussa were Masinissa's three sons, among whom he divided his kingdom of Numidia, but only Micipsa survived; his two brothers soon fell victim to disease. Micipsa's reign lasted thirty years (148-118 BC). He continued the alliance with Rome, during which Numidia enjoyed relative peace and prosperity. His two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, were raised to assume the throne, but when they were still young their older cousin Jugurtha, Mastanabal's illegitimate son, joined the household. Jugurtha's evident talents were a cause of concern to Micipsa, who accordingly sent him to Hispania to serve the Romans in their war against Numantia, which ended in 133 BC. As a warrior Jugurtha performed very well, winning great favor among the Roman commanders, one of whom, Scipio Aemilianus, wrote a favorable letter to Micipsa. Upon his return Micipsa adopted Jugurtha and made him co-heir with his own two young sons. Sallust's rendering of Scipio's letter: > \\"Your nephew Jugurtha has distinguished himself in the Numantine War above > everyone else, which I'm sure will give you pleasure. I hold him in > affection for his services and will do all I can to make him equally > esteemed by the Roman Senate and People. As your friend I congratulate you > personally; you have in him a man worthy of yourself and of his grandfather > Masinissa.\\"Sallust (86‚Äì36), Bellum Iugurthinum (late 40s B.C.E.), 5‚Äì8, > translated as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1963), 39 (Micipsa's two sons and > nephew Jugurtha), 40‚Äì42 (Jugurtha in Hispania), 42 (letter quoted, Jugurtha > adopted and made heir). At Micipsa's death in 118, the three became rulers of adjacent lands carved out of Numidia. Yet Jugurtha's suspicions were soon aroused. He had Hiempsal killed; then defeated Adherbal in battle. Rome intervened and, due to bribes paid by Jugurtha, merely caused the lands to be redivided. Eventually Jugurtha again attacked Adherbal, besieging him in the city of Cirta. Rome again sent its agents to broker a settlement. But in 112 Jugurtha accepted the city's terms of surrender; nonetheless Adherbal was tortured and killed, and Italian traders were slaughtered. Jugurtha then became king of all Numidia.Sallust, Bellum Iugurthinum, 10‚Äì25, translated as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1963), 44‚Äì46 (Micipsa dies, Hiempsal murdered, Adherbal defeated), 47‚Äì53 (Adherbal and Jugurtha at Rome, which splits the lands), 57‚Äì62 (Jugurtha attacks Adherbal at Cirta, who appeals to Rome again), 62 (Adherbal tortured and killed, Italians at Cirta slaughtered). Whether or not he intended to \\"unite all the Berbers in a patriotic war\\" following the vision of Masinissa (see above) is uncertain.Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib. An Interpretive Essay (Princeton University 1977), 30. To the west of Numidia was the Berber Kingdom of Mauretania (in modern Algeria), under the reign of Bocchus I. Jugurtha married his daughter. Farther west, Tingis (modern Tangier) was the capital of another Berber realm comprising western Mauretania, under its king, Bogud, brother of Bocchus I. To the south of Numidia and Mauritania and Africa Province lay the lands of the Berber Gaetulians, who were not politically united. On these lands Berber pastoralist managed their flocks, and in lean years would naturally seek better pasturage. A major advantage sought by Rome in its Numidian alliance was leverage in dealing with these other Berbers, in order to maintain the peace.Theodor Mommsen, R√∂manische Geschichte, volume 5 (Leipzig 1885, 5th ed. 1904), translated as The Provinces of the Roman Empire (London: R. Bentley & Sons 1886; London: Macmillan 1909; reprint: Barnes & Noble 1996), 307. \\"[T]he policy of Rome appears to have been to co-opt the tribal leaders, and through them to control the tribes.\\"Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 50 and et seq.; also 42 (Bocchus I, father-in-law of Jugurtha). Africa Province became the scene of military actions involving key Roman leaders toward the end of the Roman Republic (c.510‚Äì44 BC). Here Numidia played a significant role. That \\"a political and military importance was given to this state, such as no other client-state of Rome ever possessed... is shown by the share of Numidia in the civil wars of Rome.\\"Mommsen, The Provinces of the Roman Empire (1885, 1996), 307. This appears to follow Livy's assessment of Masinissa given above. A modern Maghribi historian puts it differently: \\"The Berber princes let themselves be drawn into alliances with the leaders of the warring Roman factions.\\"Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib.

Jugurtha (r.118‚Äì105 BC), the Berber king of Numidia (to the west of the Province) and grandson of the revered king Masinissa (r. 202‚Äì148 BC), was well known to his Roman allies. In part due to the favors he gave to Roman politicians, Jugurtha had managed to enlarge the scope of his power; yet eventually his dealings resulted in a notorious bribery scandal at Rome. Jugurtha's assassinations of his regal cousins, his military aggression and overreach, and his slaughter of Italian traders at Cirta led to war with Rome.Abun-Nasr describes Numidia then as a Roman protectorate. A History of the Maghrib (1971), 30. The war's prosecution involved the hands-on participation of two controversial Roman political and military leaders. Gaius Marius celebrated his triumph due to his success in finishing Rome's long war against Jugurtha. A wealthy novus homo and populares, Marius was the first Roman general to enlist proletari (landless citizens) into his army; as a politician he was chosen Consul an unprecedented seven times (107, 104‚Äì100, 86), but his career ended badly. On the opposing side politically, the optimate Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, later Consul (88, 80), and Dictator (82‚Äì79), had served as quaestor under Marius in Numidia. In 106 Sulla had persuaded Bocchus I of Mauritania to hand over Jurgurtha, which ended the war. This conflict was later (c. 40 BC) described by the ancient Roman political writer Sallust (86‚Äì35), in his well-known monograph Belum Jugurthinum.Sallust, Belum Iugurthinum, 113, translated as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1964), 147‚Äì148 (Jugurtha captured and then sent in chains to Rome).Abdallah Laroui, in his L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib. An Interpretive Essay (Princeton University 1977), 30, makes this comment: > \\"The history of the long war waged by Roman armies is as much the history of > the inner contradictions of the Roman republic... as of Jugurtha's revolt. > Jugurtha's action may or may not have been a conscious effort to unite all > the Berbers in a patriotic war; Sallust's account offers no proof either > way, since to him Jugurtha was a mere pretext for airing a moral judgment on > Rome and its leaders.\\" . Thereafter Hiempsal II (r. 106‚Äì60), a nephew of Jugurtha, became king of Numidia.Dates of his father's reign are said to start in 106 or 105 and to end the same year, or to end later in 88. Thereafter Hiempsal II became king. Cf. Ilevbare, Carthage, Rome and the Berbers (Ibadan University 1980), 175. During an armed phase of political-economic struggle for Rome between populares led by Marius and optimates under Sulla, Hiempsal II apparently favored the aristocratic Sulla. In 88 BC after Sulla's army entered Rome nearly unopposed, the aging Marius was forced to flee to Africa to seek asylum. King Hiempsal welcomed Marius, but decided to hold his guest prisoner. Marius sensed the danger and effected his escape.Plutarch (c.46‚Äì120), Bioi Paralleloi [Parallel Lives], translated by John Dryden, revised, as Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans (New York: Random House, The Modern Library [no date]), \\"Caius Marius\\", 494‚Äì525, 520‚Äì521. Later Hiempsal lost his crown for several years. The populares being led by Marius and Cinna, allies of Cinna deposed Hiempsal favor of \\"a Numidian pretender named Iarbus\\". But Cinna was killed, and a shift in the Roman struggle favored the optimate Sulla, who emerged victorious in November of 82. Marius committed suicide, and Sulla sent the young Pompey to Numidia to restore Hiempsal to the throne.H. H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero. A history of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68 (London: Methuen 1959; 4th ed. 1976), 72 (Marius flees to Africa), and 80‚Äì81 (Sulla's victory; Hiempsal and Iarbus, Pompey). Juba, Bocchus, Juba, Ptolemy Juba I (85‚Äì46, r.60‚Äì46) of Numidia. Decades later, the Numidian king Juba I (r. 60‚Äì46) played a significant role in Rome's civil wars, contested by arms between Pompey and Julius Caesar. Juba I was king by descent, being in the line of the famous Masinissa (240‚Äì148), per Mastanabal (king 148‚Äì140), via Jugurtha's half- brother Gauda (king, 106‚Äì88), by Gauda's son Hiempsal II (king thereafter, 88‚Äì62), who was the father of Juba I.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 43.Duane W. Roller, The World of Juba II and Kleopatra Selene (New York: Routledge 2003), 265 (\\"Numidian royal line\\"). In 47 BC, Julius Caesar and his forces landed in Africa in pursuit of Pompey's remnant army, which was headquartered at Utica near Carthage. There Caesar's enemies Pompey and Cato enjoyed the support of Juba I. > Juba I had long held a personal animus against Julius Caesar dating back to > an incident when Caesar was praetor (62 BC) in Africa; the story is related > by the ancient Roman writer Suetonius and regarded King Hiempsal II, father > of Juba I.

Cato 'Uticensis', a praetor in 54 and a political leader of Caesar's optimate opponents. was at Utica with Juba I. Cato was widely admired, but also widely mocked.Cato's posthumous title 'Uticensis' refers to the Punic city of Utica, where he died. This Cato was a descendant of the famous Cato the Elder (234‚Äì149, Consul 195). Ironically, it was this elder Cato's fanatic hatred of Carthage that spurred Rome to later destroy the Punic city-state (146 BC). Bowder, ed., Who was Who in the Roman World (Cornell Univ. 1980), 52‚Äì53. Caesar's nearby victory at the Battle of Thapsus almost put an end to this Roman civil war. Cato committed suicide by his sword.H. L. Havel, Republican Rome (London 1914, reprinted 1996), 522‚Äì524. Cato Uticensis was a controversial figure, admired by his political faction as a defender of the ancient Republic, but mocked by his opponents as a defender of aristocratic privilege, whose intransigence pushed Rome into civil war. His claim would be as a martyr of republican liberty. Havel (1914, 1996), 524. Juba I, his kingdom lost, also committed suicide.Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Paris 1970, Princeton University 1977), 30.Havel, Republican Rome (1914, 1996), 523. Juba's end was singular. Retreating to a villa after the battle, he and a Roman army veteran both ate well, then‚Äîescape being hopeless‚Äîchoose to fight each other to the death. Juba won. On his order, a slave then slew him. Ibid. Caesar annexed Numidia for Rome. The Berber kings of Mauretania, Bocchus II of the east (roughly the modern Algerian coast), and his brother Bogud of the west (capital at Tingi, modern Tangier), had both favored Julius Caesar (100‚Äì44 BC), whom Juba I had worked to oppose. Both had significantly aided Caesar's campaigns: Bogud fought with Caesar in the second Hispanic War; in Africa, Bocchus II captured the Numidian capital city of Cirta from Juba I. In the final Roman civil war (c. 34‚Äì30), the contest lay between Octavius and Marcus Antonius. Bocchus II favored Octavius, Julius Caesar's adopted son, later renowned as Augustus, but Bogud inclined to Antonius. The victory of Augustus cost Bogud his kingdom. Bocchus II remained king, yet before he died, Bochus II willed his kingdom to Rome.Theodor Mommsen, R√∂mische Geschichte, band 5 (Leipzig 1885), translated as The Provinces of the Roman Empire (London 1886, reprint New York 1996), 310‚Äì311 [in Chap. XIII \\"The African Provinces\\"]. Juba II, reigned 25 BCE ‚Äì 23 CE. Augustus (imperial rule: 31 BC ‚Äì 14 AD) controlled the Roman state following the civil wars that marked the end of the Republic (c. 510‚Äì44 BC). He established a quasi-constitutional regime known as the Principate, commonly included as the first phase of the Empire. Roman actions in Africa throughout the period of civil war are harshly criticized by a modern Maghribi historian, Abdallah Laroui, who notes the cumulative lands lost by Berbers to Romans, and how the Romans had steadily steered events to their benefit.\\"The Roman senate supervised, intrigued, and fomented internecine wars in order to weaken the Numidian kings and make them into docile clients.\\" Abdallah Laroui, L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synth√®se (Paris: Librairie Fran√ßois Maspero 1970), translated as The History of the Maghrib. An Interpretive Essay (Princeton University 1977), 54. About 26 BC, the emperor Augustus at Rome moved to \\"restore\\" the Berber royal line stemming from Masinissa by installing Juba II (son of the defeated Juba I) on the throne, not as King of Numidia, but of Mauritania (west of Numidia).Numidia had already been annexed by Julius Caesar (see above: Juba I). Captured as a youth by the Romans, Juba II had been raised and educated in proximity to the court of Augustus, who became his personal friend. Juba II was installed in power as a client king of the Empire, an amicus romani (\\"friend of Rome\\"). His domain was \\"an artificial monarchy: imposed by Rome on an area which his family had never governed.\\"Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), quote on p. 45. Ptolemy (r. 23‚Äì40 AD) of Mauretania. Juba II was also \\"a Greek man of letters\\", an able author of books on the culture and history of Africa, including his Libyka (written circa 25‚Äì5 BC) on the Berber peoples, and later a popular book on Arabia. Unfortunately, only scattered pieces of these works remain.Duane W. Roller, The World of Juba II and Kleopatra Selene (New York: Routledge 2003), Libyka, 183‚Äì211, On Arabia, 227‚Äì243. He married well: Cleopatra Selene II, the daughter of Marcus Antonius, consul (44, 34 BC) and triumvir (43‚Äì38, 37‚Äì33 BC), and Cleopatra, the Ptolemaic Queen of Egypt; she also had been raised at Rome. Their new capital of Greco-Roman style, Iol Caesarea, was established on the sea coast. Though intended to serve as a buffer between Roman Africa and Berber tribes (both those settled or long accustomed to transhumance within the province, and those south of the frontier), Juba II was never accepted by the more tribal elements among his kingdom's Gaetulian Berbers; many of them not only resisted taxation but also joined an armed, anti-Roman insurgency. Yet Juba II did enjoy a long reign (r. 25 BC ‚Äì 23 AD) under Roman sponsorship and support.Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (1971), 31.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 43‚Äì46.Theodor Mommsen,R√∂mische Geschichte, band 5 (Leipzig 1885), translated as The Provinces of the Roman Empire (London 1886, 1909; reprint Barnes & Noble 1996) at II: 307-311 (Caesar's African policy), 311‚Äì313 (Juba II). The unpopular reign of his son Ptolemy [Ptolemaeus] (r.23‚Äì40 AD) provoked an increase in Berber support for the rebel forces of Tacfarinas (see below). Ptolemy himself assisted the armies of the Roman governor of Numidia against this wide-scale insurgency (17‚Äì24 AD).Tacitas, The Annals of Imperial Rome (Penguin 1956, rev. 1989), 168‚Äì170 (IV, 24‚Äì27). Later, in 40 AD on a visit to Rome, Ptolemy was assassinated by order of the notorious Emperor Caligula. Following his death, the Gaetulians of Mauritania rebelled, which Rome eventually quelled. Ptolemy's kingdom and other lands to the west were annexed by the Empire as the Provinces of Mauritania Caesaria (approximately the central and western coast of modern Algeria), and Mauritania Tingitana (northern Morocco).H. H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero. A history of Rome from 133BC to AD68 (1959, 4th ed. 1976), 306.Brett and Fentress, The Berbers (1996), 47. Thus ended, in its seventh generation, the royal line of Masinissa. Tacfarinas and the land View of the northern Tunisian plateau at T√©boursouk, near Thugga (site of extensive Roman ruins). The upper Bagradas (modern Medjerda) river valley, was a prime wheat-growing country that supplied grain to Rome. Conflict between new Roman agriculture and the traditional grazing rights of Berber pastoralists led to the insurgency of Tacfarinas. Tacfarinas was not born a king or into a royal or a noble bloodline, but a Berber commoner who fought against the Roman Empire in order to maintain tribal grazing rights to land. As a result, he became the tribal chief of his people, the Musulamii. Eventually he led a large tribal confederacy, with assistance from neighboring Berber kingdoms, which for many years sustained a major conflict against Rome.On Tacfarinas: Marguerite Rachet, Rome et les Berberes (Bruxelles: Latomus Revue d'Etudes Latines 1970), 82‚Äì143. Events of the insurgency of Tacfarinas, which persisted during the years 17 to 24, and of the Roman campaign against him, appear in the well-known Annals of the Roman historian Tacitus (c.55‚Äìc.117).Cornelius Tacitus, Ab excessu divi Augusti (c.105‚Äì117), translated as The Annals of Imperial Rome (London: Penguin 1956, rev. 1989). Tacfarinas appears in five entries spread across Books II, III, IV, totaling close to six pages in the Penguin edition. Parallels have been drawn to a previous Roman campaign in Numidia against the Berber king Jugurtha (r. 118‚Äì105),See above, in this article. recorded by the Roman historian Sallust.Sallust (86‚Äìc.35), Bellum Iugurthinum (c.44‚Äì40), translated as The Jugurthine War (Penguin 1963). It has been long alleged that both historians allow ancient Roman political concerns to distort and obscure the reality of the Berber situation and the Berber leaders.E.g., Abdallah Laroui, The History of the Maghrib (Paris 1970; Princeton University 1977), 31, note 9. Tacfarinas, as a commoner of Numidia, served for a time in the Roman Army occupying its imperial Africa Province, but he later deserted. His loyalty lay with his tribe the Musulamii, pastoralists who practiced transhumance, i.e., wintering their herds in the dryer south, but in summer moving their livestock herds northward to better-watered lands.Tacitus, The Annals of Imperial Rome ([c.AD 117]; Penguin 1956, rev. 1989), 103 (II,50). Throughout the Empire news of the fertile soils of Africa eventually spread, which was an invitation to people looking for agricultural opportunities. Accordingly, many ordinary Italians and various peoples of the Empire immigrated there to work and live; the wealthy sent agents with investment funds to purchase and manage the land; those with political influence might have been similarly favored. Ownership of public land was considered Roman by right of conquest; for local private real estate, citizens had to pay the Roman stipendium tax.A. Mahjoubi and P. Salama, \\"The Roman and post-Roman period in North Africa\\" 261‚Äì285: 270‚Äì272, in G. Mokhtar, editor, General History of Africa, vol. II: Ancient Civilizations of Africa (Paris: UNESCO 1990).See History of Roman era Tunisia, subsection Agricultural lands. Lands of the north, formerly open to summer seasonal grazing, began to be taken and transformed into farms. Hence in late spring tribes of pastoral Berbers arrived at what they considered their customary grazing lands, only to be told that the land was now entirely owned by another, a planter, who refused them permission to graze and water their herds. The new, often large, agricultural operations produced grain for export, which quickly became highly profitable. The two opposing sides were firmly committed to their own interests.H√©di Slim, Ammar Mahjoubi, Khaled Belkhoha, Abdelmajid Ennabli, L'Antiquit√© (Tunis: Sud √âditions 2010), 169‚Äì170 (e.g., Roman colonists, land registration), 192‚Äì195 (agriculture, from Punic variety to Roman monoculture).

In the countryside Tacfarinas raised and led an armed revolt. At first the Romans dismissed him as a bandit. Using Roman methods, Tacfarinas trained the tribal warriors into military formations, and his initial success made him tribal chief. Other Berber tribes from Numidia and Mauretania joined him. The Roman Army, tasked to defeat him, offered battle. Tacfarinas accepted, but was routed. The next year Tacfarinas began attacking and looting the new settlers and villages, as told in the account given by Tacitus. Then the insurgents surrounded a Roman regular battalion, who abandoned its commander yet survived the battle, though disgraced; this battalion was later decimated as punishment by the Roman governor. Grown wealthy with loot, Tacfarinas set up a permanent base, where he was attacked and defeated by the Romans, but he escaped into the desert.Cornelius Tacitus, Ab excessu divi Augusti (c.105‚Äì117), translated as The Annals of Imperial Rome (London: Penguin 1956, rev. 1989), 103 (II,50), 129‚Äì130 (III,19‚Äì21). Tacfarinas raised new forces from the countryside, but also offered to negotiate land for peace. \\"The Numidian leader took up arms to force the all-powerful emperor to recognize his people's right to land.\\"A. Mahjoubi and P. Salama, \\"The Roman and post-Roman period in North Africa\\", 261-285: 261-262 (quote), 269-272, in G. Mokhtar, editor, General History of Africa, vol.

The Emperor Tiberius was furious at this no-account commoner, who by offering terms acted like a king. Instead, the Romans offered pardon to rebels who surrendered and also set up counter-insurgency style operations, with many strategic forts and small armed patrols, which checked the rebels for a while. Tiberius, misperceiving the situation, awarded the Roman commander a victory triumph in the year 22. Nonetheless, Tacfarinas renewed the fight as strong as ever. He led the forces of his tribe, together with allies from Numidia and Mauretania, with additional assistance from the Berber Garamentes. Tacfarinas also spread persuasive anti-Roman propaganda. In the year 24, however, following field intelligence, Roman forces surprised the secret camp of Tacfarinas, who died fighting.Tacitus, The Annals of Imperial Rome ([c.AD 117]; Penguin 1956, rev. 1989), 154-155 (III,72-74), 168-170 (IV,22-25).H√©di Slim, Ammar Mahjoubi, Khaled Belkhoha, Abdelmajid Ennabli, L'Antiquit√© (Tunis: Sud √âditions 2010), 165-167 (Tacfarinas).

Turner is an American ecologist known for her work at Yellowstone National Park since the large fires of 1988. She is currently the Eugene P. Odum Professor of Ecology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.  Life and career  Turner was raised in the suburbs of Long Island just outside New York city. Her father was a self-employed lawyer and her mother was a Girl Scouts executive. Turner obtained her B.S in Biology summa cum laude from Fordham University in 1980. Turner went on to receive her Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of Georgia. After finishing her Ph.D., she stayed at the University of Georgia as a postdoctoral researcher. She worked with Eugene P. Odum to examine the changes in land use in the Georgia landscape, one of the earliest US landscape ecology studies. In 1986, together with Colleague Frank Golley, Turner helped organize the first American meeting for landscape ecology. In 1987, after completion of her postdoctoral research, Turner went on to become a staff scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At Oak Ridge, Turner began a project on the spatial distribution of land use in forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains. Work at Yellowstone During her time at Oak Ridge, her group developed simulations important in modeling key concepts in landscape ecology, including predictions of species movement patterns, spread of disturbance, and the connectivity of habitats across landscapes. In 1988, Turner sought to find a landscape in which to study her model. After rejoining with fellow ecologist Bill Romme, an expert in Yellowstone fire-history, Turner was able to find the landscape she needed in the fire-ridden Yellowstone, in which more than one-third of the park had been burned. That 1988 \\"summer of fire\\" made Yellowstone history. Early blazes, sparked in June by a combination of lightning and human activities, burned for several weeks without raising much concern. As the summer got hotter and drier, though, the situation quickly turned. In July, \\"we had active fires spread, but nothing that we hadn't previously experienced,\\" recalls Roy Renkin, a Yellowstone biologist. \\"But then, here came August. ... Then things started to really pick up and go.\\" Turner also examined the regrowth of lodgepole pine and other dominant tree species in the park. Turner and Romme began working in the park in the summer of 1989. With no funding, they recruited volunteer labor. Friends, former students, and family members pitched in when they could. Even Turner‚Äôs mother spent her two weeks of vacation in the park measuring burned trees. Turner's work at Yellowstone gave insight into vegetation dynamics concerning changing disturbance regimes, vertebrate grazing, and soil-microbe nutrient interactions. After Yellowstone's stand-replacing fire in 2000, Turner found that relatively large amounts of ammonium depletion occurred during the first four years. Turner‚Äôs work at Yellowstone, over a period of 20 years, has provided an insight unto the resiliency of ecosystems after major disturbances.

The organisation has won a number of awards, including The Economist's New Media Award in 2008 at the Index on Censorship Awards and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009. In 2010, the New York Daily News listed WikiLeaks first among websites \\"that could totally change the news\\", and Julian Assange received the Sam Adams Award and was named the Readers' Choice for TIME's Person of the Year in 2010. The UK Information Commissioner has stated that \\"WikiLeaks is part of the phenomenon of the online, empowered citizen\\". In its first days, an Internet petition calling for the cessation of extrajudicial intimidation of WikiLeaks attracted over six hundred thousand signatures. Supporters of WikiLeaks in the media and academia have commended it for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, supporting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. At the same time, several U.S. government officials have criticized WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy. From the perspective of the U.S. security establishment, the issue of concern is not only the publication of sensitive information but also, at a deeper level, the anonymity afforded by the internet. Several human rights organisations requested with respect to earlier document releases that WikiLeaks adequately redact the names of civilians working with international forces, in order to prevent repercussions. Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In response to some of the negative reaction, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed her concern over the \\"cyber war\\" against WikiLeaks, and in a joint statement with the Organization of American States the UN Special Rapporteur has called on states and other actors to keep international legal principles in mind.  Response from governments  = Australia = On 16 March 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority added WikiLeaks to their proposed list of sites that will be blocked for all Australians if the mandatory internet filtering scheme is implemented as planned. The blacklisting had been removed by 29 November 2010. On 2 December 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard made a statement that she 'absolutely condemns' WikiLeaks' actions and that the release of information on the site was 'grossly irresponsible' and 'illegal.' WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is Australian and he responded two days later by accusing his prime minister of betraying him as an Australian citizen. However, on 8 December 2010 ‚Äì after WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic cables in which United States diplomats labelled him a \\"control freak\\", former Australian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister (now resigned) Kevin Rudd said the leak of the US secret cables raised questions about US security. Rudd said, \\"The core responsibility, and therefore legal liability, goes to those individuals responsible for that initial unauthorised release.\\" In an article in The Australian, Assange claimed, \\"The Australian attorney-general is doing everything he can to help a US investigation clearly directed at framing Australian citizens and shipping them to the US.\\" However, Australian officials later said that Assange has done nothing illegal. Since then, representatives of the Australian Federal Government and the major opposition including Craig Emerson the Minister for Trade have come out in support of WikiLeaks and against some violent rhetoric directed against them, stating; \\"We condemn absolutely the threats that have been made by some people in the United States against Julian Assange.\\" = Brazil = President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva expressed his \\"solidarity\\" with Julian Assange following Assange's 2010 arrest in the United Kingdom. Lula went on to state ‚Äì in reference to WikiLeaks disclosure of classified US diplomatic cables in November and December 2010 ‚Äì WikiLeaks had \\"exposed a diplomacy that had appeared unreachable.\\" He further criticised the arrest of Julian Assange as \\"an attack on freedom of expression\\". = China = The WikiLeaks website claims that the government of the People's Republic of China has attempted to block all traffic to websites with \\"wikileaks\\" in the URL since 2007, but that this can be bypassed by encrypted connections or by using one of WikiLeaks' many covert URLs. = Ecuador = In late November 2010, a representative of the government of Ecuador made what was, apparently, an unsolicited public offer to Julian Assange to establish residency in Ecuador. Deputy Foreign Minister Kinto Lucas stated \\"we are going to invite him to come to Ecuador so he can freely present the information he possesses and all the documentation, not just on the Internet, but in various public forums.\\" Lucas went on to state his praise for WikiLeaks and Assange calling them \\"[people] who are constantly investigating and trying to get light out of the dark corners of [state] information.\\" The following day, however, president Rafael Correa distanced his administration from the offer stating that Lucas had been speaking for himself and not on the government's behalf. Correa then criticised Assange for \\"breaking the laws of the United States and leaking this type of information.\\" = France = The French Industry Minister √âric Besson said in a letter to the CGIET technology agency, WikiLeaks \\"violates the secret of diplomatic relations and puts people protected by diplomatic secret in danger.\\" Therefore, it would be 'unacceptable' that the site was hosted on servers based in France. The minister asked for measures to bar WikiLeaks from France. = Germany = The home of Theodor Reppe, registrant of the German WikiLeaks domain name, wikileaks.de, was raided on 24 March 2009 after WikiLeaks released the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) censorship blacklist. The site was not affected.. Mirror available: 24 March 2009 = Iceland = After the release of the 2007 Baghdad airstrikes video and as they prepared to release film of the Granai airstrike, Julian Assange has said that his group of volunteers came under intense surveillance. In an interview and Twitter posts he said that a restaurant in Reykjav√≠k where his group of volunteers met came under surveillance in March; that there was \\"covert following and hidden photography\\" by police and foreign intelligence services; that an apparent British intelligence agent made thinly veiled threats in a Luxembourg car park; and that one of the volunteers was detained by police for 21 hours. Another volunteer posted that computers were seized, saying \\"If anything happens to us, you know why... and you know who is responsible.\\" According to the Columbia Journalism Review, \\"the Icelandic press took a look at Assange's charges of being surveilled in Iceland [...] and, at best, have found nothing to substantiate them.\\" In August 2009, Kaupthing Bank secured a court order preventing Iceland's national broadcaster, R√öV, from broadcasting a risk analysis report showing the bank's substantial exposure to debt default risk. This information had been leaked to WikiLeaks and remained available on the WikiLeaks website; faced with an injunction minutes before broadcast, the channel aired a screen-shot of the WikiLeaks site instead of the scheduled piece on the bank. Citizens of Iceland were reported to be outraged that R√öV was prevented from broadcasting news of relevance. Therefore, WikiLeaks has been credited with inspiring the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, a bill meant to reclaim Iceland's 2007 Reporters Without Borders (Reporters sans fronti√®res) ranking as first in the world for free speech. It aims to enact a range of protections for sources, journalists, and publishers. Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir, a former WikiLeaks volunteer and member of the Icelandic parliament, is the chief sponsor of the proposal. = India = In identical statements to both Houses of Parliament on 18 March 2011, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rejected all allegations against his government revealed by the United States diplomatic cables leak, including allegations of bribery during the 2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence. Singh told Parliament, \\"The Government of India cannot confirm the veracity, contents or even the existence of such communications. I may point out that many of the persons referred to in those reports have stoutly denied the veracity of the contents. An issue was raised that the offence of bribery was committed in India. Government rejects that allegation absolutely and firmly.\\"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-manmohan-singh-rejects- wikileakss-charges-of-bribery-1521439 In an interview with Times Now, Julian Assange labelled the Indian government's response as \\"one of the worst in the world\\" and a \\"clear attempt to mislead the nation on what the cables were\\". Assange stated, \\"The response by the government left a lot to be desired. Before it was clear to me that Prime Minister Mr. Singh was deliberately attempting to mislead the Indian people on what type of material this was. People tell me that he is not personally corrupt, I do not know myself as I don't have information on that. But, his reaction left a lot to be desired. It wasn't to fully and frankly investigate what was going on and then provide finding to the parliament. Rather, it was attempt to spin the issue and I suspect that has come from experience in dealing with similar scandals in the past.\\" = Iran = The President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, also criticised WikiLeaks following the release of United States diplomatic cables. Ahmadinejad claimed that the release of cables purporting to show concern with Iran by Arab states was a planned leak by the United States to discredit his government, though he did not indicate whether he believed WikiLeaks was in collusion with the United States or was simply an unwitting facilitator. = Libya = Muammar Gaddafi blamed WikiLeaks for the Tunisian revolution \\"[Do not be fooled by] WikiLeaks which publishes information written by lying ambassadors in order to create chaos.\\" = Philippines = President Benigno Aquino III condemned WikiLeaks and leaked documents related to the country, saying that it can lead to massive cases of miscommunication. = Russia = In December 2010, the office of the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev issued a statement calling on non-governmental organisations to consider \\"nominating [Julian] Assange as a Nobel Prize laureate.\\" The announcement followed commentary by Russian ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin who stated that Julian Assange's earlier arrest on Swedish charges demonstrated that there was \\"no media freedom\\" in the west. = Thailand = The Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES) is currently censoring the WikiLeaks website in Thailand and more than 40,000 other websites because of the emergency decree declared in Thailand at the beginning of April 2010 as a result of political instabilities. = Turkey= The Turkish government blocked access to Wikileaks on 20 July 2016 after it released nearly 300,000 emails involving the ruling Justice and Development Party. The email releases were in response to the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt. = Venezuela = Hugo Ch√°vez, president of Venezuela, stated his support for WikiLeaks following the release of US diplomatic cables in November 2010 that showed the United States had tried to rally support from regional governments to isolate Venezuela. \\"I have to congratulate the people of WikiLeaks for their bravery and courage,\\" Ch√°vez commented in televised remarks. = United Nations = In December 2010 United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression Frank LaRue stated he agreed with the idea that Julian Assange was a \\"martyr for free speech.\\" LaRue went on to say Assange or other WikiLeaks staff should not face legal accountability for any information they disseminated, noting that, \\"if there is a responsibility by leaking information it is of, exclusively of the person that made the leak and not of the media that publish it. And this is the way that transparency works and that corruption has been confronted in many cases.\\" High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, subsequently voiced concern at the revelation that private companies were being pressured by states to sever their relationships with WikiLeaks. = United States = On 17 July 2010, Jacob Appelbaum spoke on behalf of WikiLeaks at the Hackers on Planet Earth conference in New York City, replacing Assange because of the presence of federal agents at the conference. He announced that the WikiLeaks submission system was again operating, after it had been suspended temporarily. Assange was a surprise speaker at a TED conference on 19 July 2010 in Oxford, England, and confirmed that the site had begun accepting submissions again. Upon returning to the US from the Netherlands, on 29 July, Appelbaum was detained for three hours at the airport by US agents, according to anonymous sources. The sources told CNET that Appelbaum's bag was searched, receipts from his bag were photocopied, and his laptop computer was inspected, although in what manner was unknown. Appelbaum reportedly refused to answer questions without a lawyer present, and was not allowed to make a telephone call. His three mobile telephones were reportedly taken and not returned. On 31 July, he spoke at a Defcon conference and mentioned his telephone being \\"seized\\". After speaking, he was approached by two FBI agents and questioned. Access to WikiLeaks is currently blocked in the United States Library of Congress. On 3 December 2010 the White House Office of Management and Budget sent a memorandum forbidding all unauthorised federal government employees and contractors from accessing classified documents publicly available on WikiLeaks and other websites. The U.S. Army, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Justice Department are considering criminally prosecuting WikiLeaks and Assange \\"on grounds they encouraged the theft of government property\\", although former prosecutors say doing so would be difficult. According to a report on the website Daily Beast, the Obama administration asked the UK, Germany, and Australia among others to also consider bringing criminal charges against Assange for the Afghan war leaks and to help limit Assange's travels across international borders. Columbia University students have been warned by their Office of Career Services that the U.S. State Department had contacted the office in an email saying that the diplomatic cables which were released by WikiLeaks were \\"still considered classified\\" and that \\"online discourse about the documents 'would call into question your ability to deal with confidential information'\\". All U.S. federal government staff have been blocked from viewing WikiLeaks. As for individual responses, government officials had mixed feelings. Although Hillary Clinton refused to comment on specific reports, she claimed that the leaks \\"put people's lives in danger\\" and \\"threatens national security\\". Former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates commented, \\"Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.\\" Following the November 2010 release of United States diplomatic cables, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced the group saying, \\"this disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests, it is an attack on the international community.\\" Peter King, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee of the United States House of Representatives has stated his support of Clinton's position for listing WikiLeaks as a \\"foreign terrorist organisation\\" explaining that \\"WikiLeaks presents a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States.\\" In a contrary statement, secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said that concerns about the disclosures were \\"over-wrought\\" in terms of their likely adverse impact on ordinary diplomatic activities. Philip J. Crowley, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, stated on 2 December 2010 that the US State Department does not regard WikiLeaks as a media organisation. \\"WikiLeaks is not a media organisation. That is our view.\\" Crowley said and with regard to Assange;\\"Well, his ‚Äì I mean he could be considered a political actor. I think he's an anarchist, but he's not a journalist.\\" US Senator Joe Lieberman called on Amazon.com to shut down a WikiLeaks web-site, praised the company for doing so, and called for other companies to follow suit. He also proposed new legislation targeting similar cases ‚Äì Securing Human Intelligence and Enforcing Lawful Dissemination Act (SHIELD Act). Lieberman later said that also The New York Times and other news organisations publishing the US embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws. After these statements the US Ambassador to Australia assured the Australian government and people that \\"The concerns we have do not centre on Julian Assange and they never should have\\" U.S. Secretary of State and former CIA Director Mike Pompeo has held mixed views on WikiLeaks, citing leaked e-mails from Hillary Clinton, campaign chair John Podesta, and former Democratic National Committee chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz even using his Twitter as a platform to call attention to the \\"newly released emails of Hillary Clinton and her cronies,\\" before a FOX appearance on the same topic. In April 2017, as CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks \\"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\\" In April 2017, AG Jeff Sessions stated that arresting Julian Assange of Wikileaks was a priority: \\"We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We've already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail.\\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/20/politics/julian-assange-wikileaks-us- charges/  Response from media  = People's Republic of China = Chinese journalist Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, in 2005 after publicising an email from Chinese officials about the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. An article in The New Yorker said: Assange responded to the suggestion that eavesdropping on Chinese hackers played a crucial part in the early days of WikiLeaks by saying \\"the imputation is incorrect. The facts concern a 2006 investigation into Chinese espionage one of our contacts was involved in. Somewhere between none and handful of those documents were ever released on WikiLeaks. Non-government targets of the Chinese espionage, such as Tibetan associations were informed (by us)\\". = Russian Federation = Russian investigative reporter Andrei Soldatov has criticised WikiLeaks for disclosing documents \\"without checking of the facts, without putting them in context, and without analysing them.\\" Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is \\"filling the gap\\" left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting.  Response from corporations  = U.S. diplomatic cables leak responses = According to The Times (London), WikiLeaks and its members have complained about continuing harassment and surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence organisations, including extended detention, seizure of computers, veiled threats, \\"covert following and hidden photography.\\" Two lawyers for Julian Assange in the United Kingdom told The Guardian that they believed they were being watched by the security services after the U.S. cables leak, which started on 28 November 2010. Furthermore, several companies ended association with WikiLeaks. After providing 24-hour notification, American-owned EveryDNS deleted WikiLeaks from its entries on 2 December 2010, citing DDoS attacks that \\"threatened the stability of its infrastructure\\". The website's 'info' DNS lookup remained operational at alternative addresses for direct access respectively to the WikiLeaks and Cablegate websites. On the same day, Amazon.com severed its association with WikiLeaks, to which it was providing infrastructure services, after an intervention by an aide of U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman. Amazon denied acting under political pressure, citing a violation of its terms of service. Citing indirect pressure from the U.S. Government, Tableau Software also deleted WikiLeaks' data from its website for people to use for data visualisation. During the days following, hundreds of (and eventually more than a thousand) mirror websites of the WikiLeaks website were established, and the Anonymous group of Internet activists asked sympathizers to attack the websites of companies which opposed WikiLeaks, under the banner of Operation Payback, previously directed at anti-piracy organisations. AFP reported that attempts to deactivate the wikileaks.org address had resulted in the website surviving via the so-called Streisand effect, whereby attempts to censor information online causes it to be replicated in many places. On 3 December, PayPal, the payment processor owned by eBay, permanently ended the account of the Wau Holland Foundation that had been redirecting donations to WikiLeaks. PayPal alleged that the account violated its \\"Acceptable Use Policy\\", specifically that the account was used for \\"activities that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity.\\" The Vice President of PayPal stated later that they stopped accepting payments after the \\"State Department told us these were illegal activities. It was straightforward.\\" Later the same day, he said that his previous statement was incorrect, and that it was in fact based on a letter from the State Department to WikiLeaks. On 8 December 2010, the Wau Holland Foundation released a press statement, saying it has filed a legal action against PayPal for blocking its account used for WikiLeaks payments and for libel due to PayPal's allegations of \\"illegal activity\\". On 6 December, the Swiss bank PostFinance announced that it had frozen the assets of Assange that it holds, totalling ‚Ç¨31,000. In a statement on its website, it stated that this was because Assange \\"provided false information regarding his place of residence\\" when opening the account. WikiLeaks released a statement saying this was because Assange, \\"as a homeless refugee attempting to gain residency in Switzerland, had used his lawyer's address in Geneva for the bank's correspondence\\". On the same day, MasterCard announced that it was \\"taking action to ensure that WikiLeaks can no longer accept MasterCard-branded products\\", adding \\"MasterCard rules prohibit customers from directly or indirectly engaging in or facilitating any action that is illegal.\\" The next day, Visa Inc. announced it was suspending payments to WikiLeaks, pending \\"further investigations\\". In a move of support for WikiLeaks, the organization XIPWIRE established a way to donate to WikiLeaks, and waived their fees. Datacell, the Iceland-based IT company controlled by Swiss investors that enabled WikiLeaks to accept credit card donations, announced that it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard, in order to resume allowing payments to the website. On 7 December 2010, The Guardian stated that people could donate to WikiLeaks via Commerzbank in Kassel, Germany, or Landsbanki in Iceland, or by post to a post office box at the University of Melbourne or at the wikileaks.ch domain. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that Visa, MasterCard, and Amazon may be \\"violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression\\" by withdrawing their services. On 21 December, media reported that Apple Inc. had removed an application from its App Store, which provided access to the embassy cable leaks. As part of its 'Initial Assessments Pursuant to... WikiLeaks', the US Presidential Executive Office has issued a memorandum to the heads of Executive Departments and Agencies asking whether they have an 'insider threat program'. On 14 July 2011, WikiLeaks and DataCell ehf. of Iceland filed a complaint against the international card companies, VISA Europe and MasterCard Europe, for infringement of the antitrust rules of the EU, in response to their withdrawal of financial services to the organisation. In a joint press release, the organisations stated: \\"The closure by VISA Europe and MasterCard of Datcell's access to the payment card networks in order to stop donations to WikiLeaks violates the competition rules of the European Community.\\" DataCell filed a complaint with the European Commission on 14 July 2011. = Response from the financial industry = Since the publications of CableGate, WikiLeaks has experienced an unprecedented global financial blockade by major finance companies including MasterCard, Visa and PayPal although there has been no legal accusation of any wrongdoing. In October 2010, it was reported that the organization Moneybookers, which collected donations for WikiLeaks, had ended its relationship with the website. Moneybookers stated that its decision had been made \\"to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities, agencies or commissions.\\" On 18 December 2010, Bank of America announced it would \\"not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for Wikileaks,\\" citing \\"Wikileaks might be engaged in activities... inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments\\". WikiLeaks responded in a tweet by encouraging their sympathizers who were BoA customers to close their accounts. Bank of America has long been believed to be the target of WikiLeaks' next major release. Late in 2010, Bank of America communicated with the law company Hunton & Williams to stop WikiLeaks. Hunton & Williams assembled a group of security specialists, HBGary Federal, Palantir Technologies, and Berico Technologies. During 5 and 6 February 2011, the group Anonymous hacked HBGary's website, copied tens of thousands of documents from HBGary, posted tens of thousands of company emails online, and usurped Barr's Twitter account in revenge. Some of the documents taken by Anonymous show HBGary Federal was working on behalf of Bank of America to respond to WikiLeaks' planned release of the bank's internal documents. Emails detailed a supposed business proposal by HBGary to assist Bank of America's law company, Hunton & Williams, and revealed that the companies were willing to violate the law to damage WikiLeaks and Anonymous. In October 2011, Julian Assange said the financial blockade had destroyed 95% of WikiLeaks' revenues and announced that it was suspending publishing operations in order to concentrate on fighting the blockade and raising new funds., Esther Addley and Jason Deans, The Guardian, 24 October 2011 On 18 July 2012, WikiLeaks, shunned by the financial industry and almost insolvent, announced that it had found a new method to accept donations. Accordingly, the Fund for the Defense of Net Neutrality (FDNN) had agreed to channel contributions via Carte Bleue, and WikiLeaks claimed that contractual obligation would prevent Visa and MasterCard blocking participation with such transactions. On 24 January 2014, WikiLeaks announced via Twitter that the majority of its donations came from (the cryptocurrencies) Litecoin and Bitcoin. WikiLeaks massive returns from early investment into Bitcoin cryptocurrency has helped the organisation to survive various legal and financial hardships. In December 2017, after five years of processing donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, Freedom of the Press Foundation's board unanimously found that the financial blockade of WikiLeaks by major payment processors was no longer in effect, and severed ties with WikiLeaks as of 8 January 2018. Support Daniel Ellsberg (2006) has made numerous media interviews supporting WikiLeaks. In July 2010 Veterans for Peace president Mike Ferner editorialised on the group's website \\"neither Wikileaks nor the soldier or soldiers who divulged the documents should be prosecuted for revealing this information. We should give them a medal.\\" Documentary filmmaker John Pilger wrote an August 2010 editorial in the Australian publication Green Left titled \\"Wikileaks must be defended.\\" In it, Pilger said WikiLeaks represented the interests of \\"public accountability\\" and a new form of journalism at odds with \\"the dominant section ... devoted merely to taking down what cynical and malign power tells it.\\" Daniel Ellsberg, the man who released the Pentagon Papers in 1971, has been a frequent defender of WikiLeaks. Following the November 2010 release of U.S. diplomatic cables, Ellsberg rejected criticism that the site was endangering the lives of U.S. military personnel and intelligence assets stating \\"not one single soldier or informant has been in danger from any of the WikiLeaks releases. That risk has been largely overblown.\\" Ellsberg went on to note that government claims to the contrary were \\"a script that they roll out every time there's a leak of any sort.\\" Following the US diplomatic cable release, which a number of media reports sought to differentiate from Ellsberg's whistleblowing, Ellsberg claimed, \\"EVERY attack now made on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange was made against me and the release of the Pentagon Papers at the time.\\" On 3 December 2010 Republican Congressman of Texas, Ron Paul, spoke out publicly during a Fox Business interview in support of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange; \\"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth,\\" Paul said. \\"In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble.\\" Paul went on to state, \\"Why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\\" In another speech at US House of Representatives Paul again defended WikiLeaks against criticism for revealing the truth and warned the US administration that \\"lying is not patriotic\\". Fellow Republican congressman Connie Mack IV of Florida also praised WikiLeaks, stating that Americans have a right to know the contents of the leaks, \\"no matter how we acquire that knowledge.\\" Australia's most senior and high-profile media professionals expressed their support for WikiLeaks in a letter to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The letter was initiated by the Walkley Foundation, who present the yearly Walkley Awards for Excellence in Journalism. The letter was signed by \\"the ten members of the Walkley Advisory Board as well as editors of major Australian newspapers and news websites and the news directors of the country's three commercial TV networks and two public broadcasters.\\" Their position (an extract from the letter) is summarised as follows: Following the November 2010 leak of United States diplomatic cables The Atlantic, in a staff editorial, opined \\"Wikileaks is a powerful new way for reporters and human rights advocates to leverage global information technology systems to break the heavy veil of government and corporate secrecy that is slowly suffocating the American press.\\" Calling legal and physical threats against WikiLeaks volunteers \\"shameful\\" the magazine went on to state, \\"Not since President Richard Nixon directed his minions to go after Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg and New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan ... has a working journalist and his source been subjected to the kind of official intimidation and threats that have been directed at Assange and Manning by high-ranking members of the Obama Administration.\\" On 4 December 2010, Reporters Without Borders condemned the \\"blocking, cyber-attacks and political pressure\\" being directed at WikiLeaks. The organisation is also concerned by some of the extreme comments made by American authorities concerning WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. On 21 December the organisation announced it will host a mirror website for the leaked US diplomatic cables being published by WikiLeaks. In an article titled \\"Only WikiLeaks can save US policy\\" published on the online foreign affairs magazine The Diplomat, former long-time CIA counter-terrorism expert Michael Scheuer said the source of interest in WikiLeaks revelations was in the inherent dishonesty of recent U.S. administrations. \\"In recent years, the US public has had to hear its leaders repeatedly tell Americans that black was white,\\" Scheuer wrote, referencing the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Evan Hughes, editor-in-chief of wired.com published his support for WikiLeaks in an online editorial titled \\"Why WikiLeaks is Good for America.\\" Despite an often contentious relationship between Wired and WikiLeaks, with the former having been accused by the latter of complicity in the identification and arrest of Chelsea Manning, Hughes argued that \\"WikiLeaks stands to improve our democracy, not weaken it.\\" He went on to note that \\"The greatest threat we face right now from WikiLeaks is not the information it has spilled and may spill in the future, but the reactionary response to it that's building in the United States that promises to repudiate the rule of law and our free speech traditions, if left unchecked.\\" A December 2010 rally in Australia protesting the Australian government's treatment of Julian Assange The New York Times reported that over 200 WikiLeaks mirror sites sprang up after some hosting companies cut their services to the company. On 5 December, a group of activists and hackers known as \\"Anonymous\\" called upon supporters to attack sites of companies that oppose WikiLeaks as part of Operation Avenge Assange. PayPal has been targeted following their decision to stop processing donations for WikiLeaks. Gregg Housh, who previously worked on other projects with Anonymous, said that he had noticed an organised attempt taking place to attack companies that have not supported WikiLeaks. In reference to the support being shown for WikiLeaks, Mr. Housh said; \\"The reason is amazingly simple, we all believe that information should be free, and the Internet should be free.\\" On 8 December 2010, the PayPal website was victim of a denial-of-service attack by Anonymous. Later that day, PayPal announced in their blog that they will release all remaining funds in the account to the foundation that was raising funds for WikiLeaks. On the same day, the websites of Visa and MasterCard were attacked by WikiLeaks supporters. By then over 1,200 mirror sites had been set up for hosting content no longer accessible at WikiLeaks.com. Anonymous also issued a fresh statement; \\"While we don't have much of an affiliation with WikiLeaks, we fight for the same reasons. We want transparency, and we counter censorship ... This is why we intend to utilise our resources to raise awareness, attack those against, and support those who are helping lead our world to freedom and democracy.\\" In December 2010, the Internet Society stated that despite the international concern about the content released by WikiLeaks, \\"we nevertheless believe it must be subject to the same laws and policies of availability as all Internet sites\\" and that \\"free expression should not be restricted by governmental or private controls over computer hardware or software, telecommunications infrastructure, or other essential components of the Internet\\". ISOC also called for appropriate action to \\"pursue and prosecute entities (if any) that acted maliciously to take it [WikiLeaks] off the air\\" because suppressing communication would merely serve to \\"undermine the integrity of the global Internet and its operation\\". On 8 December 2010 a petition was launched on Avaaz in support of WikiLeaks, which was signed by over 250 thousand people within the first few hours, the total number went up to 600 thousand by 15 December 2010. In early December 2010, Noam Chomsky offered his support to protesters across Australia planning to take to the streets in defence of WikiLeaks. In an interview for Democracy Now!, Chomsky criticized the government response, saying, \\"perhaps the most dramatic revelation ... is the bitter hatred of democracy that is revealed both by the U.S. Government ‚Äì Hillary Clinton, others ‚Äì and also by the diplomatic service.\\" In 2015, Randy Credico made news for being handcuffed and thrown out of the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner for supporting Assange.https://sputniknews.com/us/201805011064045655-randy-credico-thrown- out-white-house-press-dinner/ Randy appeared in an interview with Jimmy Dore after and described the experience, \\"I'm really feeling guilty about Julian Assange, being in that room, and everybody here about to be celebrated, CNN... and so I walked into the middle of the room[...] and I went up there before the program actually started. I just couldnt hold back because I didn't want to interrupt the comedian. So i started yelling out to the stage, 'We should be celebrating and supporting Julian Assange. He's the greatest journalist, god bless...\\" and so i went to about three different spots, as loud as I possibly could bellow out those words, 'We, CNN, all of the news organisations, should be celebrating, and we should be commending Julian Assange. 100% accuracy! he's sacrificing his liberty!'https://web.archive.org/web/20180502060506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaB0WM96NN4 =Awards and nominations= In 2008, Index on Censorship presented WikiLeaks with their inaugural Economist New Media Award.

In 2014 the Kazakhstan Union of Journalists Top Prize. Additionally, Wikileaks was nominated for awards but did not win: 1 February 2011, Norwegian politician and musician Snorre Valen nominated WikiLeaks for the Nobel Peace Prize, totaling six nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in consecutive years (2010-2015) for the organization 2015 Wikileaks received a nomination for the UN Mandela Prize. six nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in consecutive years (2010-2015) Criticisms WikiLeaks has attracted criticism from a variety of sources. In 2007 John Young, operator of Cryptome, left his position on the WikiLeaks Board of Directors accusing the group of being a \\"CIA conduit\\". Young subsequently retreated from his assertion but has continued to be critical of the site. In a 2010 interview with CNET.com Young accused the group of a lack of transparency regarding their fundraising and financial management. He went on to state his belief that WikiLeaks could not guarantee whistleblowers the anonymity or confidentiality they claimed and that he \\"would not trust them with information if it had any value, or if it put me at risk or anyone that I cared about at risk.\\" When asked to join their initial advisory board, Steven Aftergood declined and told TIME that \\"they have a very idealistic view of the nature of leaking and its impact. They seem to think that most leakers are crusading do-gooders who are single-handedly battling one evil empire or another.\\" Citing the leaking of the sorority rituals of Alpha Sigma Tau, Steven Aftergood has opined that WikiLeaks \\"does not respect the rule of law nor does it honor the rights of individuals.\\" Aftergood went on to state that WikiLeaks engages in unrestrained disclosure of non-governmental secrets without compelling public policy reasons and that many anti-corruption activists were opposed to the site's activities. In 2010, Amnesty International joined several other human rights groups in strongly requesting that WikiLeaks redact the names of Afghan civilians working as U.S. military informants from files they had released, in order to protect them from repercussions. Julian Assange responded by offering Amnesty International the opportunity to assist in the tedious document vetting process. When Amnesty International appeared to express reservations in accepting the offer, Assange stated that he had \\"no time to deal with people who prefer to do nothing but cover their asses.\\" Other groups that joined Amnesty International in criticising WikiLeaks subsequently noted that, despite their displeasure over the issue of civilian name redaction, they generally appreciated WikiLeaks' work. In an August 2010 open letter, the non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders praised WikiLeaks' past usefulness in exposing \\"serious violations of human rights and civil liberties\\" but criticised the group over a perceived absence of editorial control, stating \\"indiscriminately publishing 92,000 classified reports reflects a real problem of methodology and, therefore, of credibility. Journalistic work involves the selection of information. The argument with which you defend yourself, namely that WikiLeaks is not made up of journalists, is not convincing.\\" The group subsequently clarified their statement as a criticism of WikiLeaks release procedure and not the organisation itself, stating \\"we reaffirm our support for Wikileaks, its work and its founding principles.\\" On 30 November 2010, former Canadian government adviser Tom Flanagan, while appearing on the CBC television program \\"Power & Politics\\", called for Julian Assange to be killed. \\"I think Assange should be assassinated,\\" Flanagan stated, before noting to host Evan Solomon, \\"I'm feeling pretty manly today.\\" Flanagan subsequently retracted his call for the death of Assange while reiterating his opposition to WikiLeaks. Dimitri Soudas, spokesman to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, decried Flanagan's comments and said the former Tory strategist's remarks are \\"simply not acceptable.\\" Ralph Goodale, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons, called Flanagan's remarks \\"clearly contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\\" Public opinion: A UMR Research December 2010 poll showed that the majority of Australians are against the official government position on WikiLeaks. The findings which were done on 1,000 individuals show 59% support WikiLeaks' action in making the cables public and 25% oppose it. This was asked a few weeks after the initial release of the cables. The poll also looked at issues in relation to Julian Assange, with the results showing a positive opinion on him. *: According to a telephone survey of 1,004 German residents age 18 and older, which was conducted end of November for the German public broadcaster ARD, a majority of 53% disapprove of WikiLeaks, while 43% are generally in favour of the platform. Asked about the specific release of US diplomatic cables, almost two-Thirds (65%) believe that these documents should not be published, compared to 31% that agree that they are being released to the public. *: A December 2010 a Gallup poll found that 52% of Pakistanis believe that \\"America herself has published the documents on purpose to create unrest,\\" while 24% believe that this is not the case and 24% did not respond. *: A CNN poll of 2,010 British adults conducted in December 2010 revealed that more people agree than disagree that WikiLeaks was right to release the cables, by 42% to 33%. The remaining 25% did not have a position. According to the same poll 41% of Britons believe that Assange should not be prosecuted for releasing the secret diplomatic cables, while 30% do want him prosecuted. Almost half of the respondents (44%) also believe that the sex charges against Assange are \\"an excuse\\" to keep him in custody so that the U.S. government can prosecute him for releasing secret diplomatic cables, while only 13% disagree. Nevertheless, almost half of Britons stated that their government should send Assange to Sweden for questioning. Older people were significantly more likely to oppose WikiLeaks. While 42% of persons 65 and older say Assange should be prosecuted for releasing the secret diplomatic cables, this view is only held by 21% of those between 25 and 34. *: According to a telephone survey of 1,029 US residents age 18 and older, conducted by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in December 2010, 70% of American respondents ‚Äì particularly Republicans and older people ‚Äì think the leaks are doing more harm than good by allowing enemies of the United States government to see confidential and secret information about U.S. foreign policy. Approximately 22% ‚Äì especially young liberals ‚Äì think the leaks are doing more good than harm by making the U.S. government more transparent and accountable. A majority of 59% also want to see the people behind WikiLeaks prosecuted, while 31% said the publication of secrets is protected under the First Amendment guarantee of a free press.

It is located in the Maloti Mountains in Leribe District, and is part of the larger Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area. This Lesotho northern park protects a high-altitude, patch of rugged wilderness, including one of Lesotho‚Äôs only stands of indigenous forest with a number of rare undergrowth plants that are unique to this woodland habitat. The name \\"Ts'ehlanyane\\" is the local common name for the berg bamboo (Thamnocalamus tessellatus), from which the river and park take their name. It is fitting that the park should bear the name of this Drakensberg endemic plant, as it may be the most important refuge for this plant in the entire Maloti- Drakensberg mountain range.  History  This proclaimed protected pristine area lies at the junction of the Ts'ehlanyane and the Holomo rivers. It owes its origin to the access road to the \\"Mamohale tunnel\\" (May 1991), which was the first adit drive for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. This adit covers from the source at Katse Dam to the As River outfall near Clarens, Free State.  Terrain  This Lesotho northern park protects a high-altitude, patch of rugged wilderness, including one of Lesotho's few stands of indigenous forest with a number of rare undergrowth plants that are unique to this woodland habitat. Here indigenous \\"ouhout\\" (Leucosidea) trees of significant size are preserved. The park has an altitude ranging from and is considered mostly sub- alpine. The diversity of habitat types is exceptionally wide and derived from the large altitudinal range that the park has.  Biota Avifauna: Species of interest include the There are also the alpine endemics, such as the *Fauna: Indigenous mammals include Snakes include the berg adder. *Flora: On the banks of the rivers and streams are stands of berg bamboo which are of significant cultural significance to the Basotho people. Berg bamboo is the host plant for an endangered butterfly species, the bamboo sylph Metisella syrinx. The reserve also encompasses a reasonable proportion of very rare mountain \\"fynbos\\" that do not occur anywhere else in the world. Also recorded are in excess of 220 flowing plant species. Lesotho's national plant is the spiral aloe, among other varied and abundant alpine flora, including over 180 flowering species.

These appointments were as follows: Between April 2003 and May 2004, Buchanan served as chair of Attorney General John Ashcroft's Advisory Committee of United States Attorneys. This committee counsels the Attorney General on law enforcement issues and plays an integral role in setting Justice Department policy. From February 2002 to 2004, she served on the Advisory Committee to the United States Sentencing Commission, which was established to study the effectiveness of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. From June 2004 until June 2005, Buchanan served as Director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. This Washington, D.C.-based office provides administrative support to the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices nationwide. Buchanan held this post at the start of the period that relates to the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. Buchanan hired Monica Goodling to work in the executive office. From November 2006 through December 2007, Buchanan served as the Acting Director of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. This office, based in Washington, DC, administers financial and technical assistance to communities nationwide that are creating programs, policies, and practices aimed at ending domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and provides leadership in developing the nation's capacity to reduce violence against women through implementation of the Violence Against Women Act. Controversial cases =United States vs. Tommy Chong (2003)= Buchanan oversaw Operation Pipe Dreams, which was a $12 million law enforcement operation targeted at individuals conducting online sales of water pipes and other devices that could be considered drug paraphernalia. The investigation resulted in 55 individuals being charged, most notably comedian and actor Tommy Chong, who was charged for his role in the financing and promoting of Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son, Paris Chong. Chong's case never went through a federal trial; instead he came to a settlement with Buchanan's office in which he admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes via the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company named for one of his movies. Of the 55 individuals charged through the investigation, Tommy Chong was the only individual without a prior criminal history who received jail time. Chong's jail time, the tactics utilized by the DEA agents during the investigation, and the investigation's focus on Tommy rather than Paris Chong (the company's CEO), raised concern among critics of selective prosecution. When asked why the government had focused on Tommy Chong instead of the company's CEO, Paris, Buchanan responded that \\"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\\" When questioned on the disparity between sentences/fines that the other 54 individuals received compared to Tommy Chong, Buchanan stated, \\"He [Tommy Chong] wasn't the biggest supplier. He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.\\" Chong was released from federal prison after nine months. He has been an avid critic of the prosecution in his case. In 2006, Chong wrote a book about his experiences in jail and his interest in meditation, called The I Chong: Meditations From The Joint. In addition, the documentary a/k/a Tommy Chong chronicles the Drug Enforcement Administration raid on his house and his subsequent jail sentence for trafficking in illegal drug paraphernalia. Tommy Chong has stated publicly that he has no ownership in the film. On May 7, 2008, federal agents raided Spectrum Labs on an investigation related to Spectrum Labs' detoxification products. The raid, one of nine during the day, was part of Operation True Test, an investigation being led by Buchanan. The investigation targeted companies that sell \\"masking products\\" that are supposed to help drug-users pass employer drug tests. Of the nine search warrants issued, none were for businesses within Buchanan's district, the Western District of Pennsylvania. In executing their search warrant, the federal agents supposedly seized over 10,000 copies of the documentary a/k/a Tommy Chong, which had yet to be released, though this was later retracted. Chong speculated that the initially alleged seizure may rest with prohibitions against one benefiting financially from a crime; however, Chong has not stated publicly that he has been charged with such an offense. In a statement released to the press, he stated \\"It's [i.e., the seizure of the DVDs] a way to punish the distributor financially. There's no way to get the DVDs back until the investigation is over.\\" Chong also stated that he has no ownership in the film. =United States vs. Karen Fletcher (2006)= Karen Fletcher of suburban Donora, Pennsylvania was indicted on six charges of distributing obscene materials over the Internet. The fictional texts featured detailed stories about the molesting, torture and sometimes gruesome murders of children under the age of 10, mostly girls. Unlike typical obscenity cases, though, Karen Fletcher was charged with violating the law through simple writing, and not with pictures or movies. Fletcher ran what was known as the \\"Red Rose\\" Web site, where she posted her fictional stories. In order to prevent minors and others from accessing the site improperly, Fletcher charged members a $10 monthly fee to have access to the site. At the time of the indictment, there were only 29 members to the site. No other member to the site was charged within the indictment. In affidavits, Fletcher wrote that she has almost no memory of her childhood up until the age of 14. She explained that her writing started out just for her and was cathartic because she had been sexually abused as a child. \\"At first I would capture a particular feeling of dread and try to weave it into a scenario that explained the feeling\\", she wrote. Fletcher described what she called her \\"monsters\\": > I have always been afraid of monsters. The monsters in my life had always > been real; for too long they were always there with unlimited access to me, > and I was helpless to do anything about it. In my stories, I have created > new monsters. [They] rise above the horror of the real life monsters. > Somehow, making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better, and makes > my life seem more bearable. I may still be afraid of the monsters, but at > least in the stories, they prey on someone else, not me. Fletcher's lawyers argued in pretrial court proceedings that their client was not guilty of the charges. Their arguments were based on a viewpoint that the stories written by Fletcher did not meet the legal definition of obscenity. The legal definition of obscenity embraces both \\"description\\", as in text, and \\"depiction\\", as in images, stated one of Fletcher's lawyers. In one of their briefs, the defense argued that Fletcher's stories, however lurid, were comparable to many scenes found in literature and television. The novel A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess, and episodes of the television cartoon South Park were cited as such examples. The defense also cited a scene in the novel The Apprentice by I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, in which a 10-year-old girl is placed in a cage with a bear who forces himself upon her sexually to habituate her to sexual submission. The lawyers argued that Fletcher's stories were no more lurid than the novel by Mr. Libby. Additionally, Fletcher's lawyers argued that she ran the web site for cathartic (medical) reasons in an attempt to help herself and others move past issues of childhood exploitation. The fact that Fletcher charged a membership fee was utilized to argue that Fletcher was not attempting to distribute the materials. Since the case was one of the handful of obscenity cases in the previous twenty years and it involved only text without visual images, First Amendment activists joined in the defense. In response to the criticism that she received from those activists, Buchanan stated, \\"It (Fletcher's stories) is some of the most disturbing, disgusting and vile material that I've ever viewed.\\" Later within another press statement, Buchanan stated that, \\"Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment, and the law is clear on that.\\" \\"This is extremely egregious and is as patently offensive as material possibly could be. I cannot imagine material more offensive than the material in the case of Karen Fletcher.\\" While pornography by itself is not illegal, it can be prosecuted as obscenity if it fits the definition laid out by the Supreme Court more than 30 years ago. Under that ruling, Miller v. California, a work may be deemed obscene if, taken as a whole, it lacks artistic, literary or scientific merit, depicts certain conduct in a patently offensive manner, and violates contemporary community standards. This standard was the one that was to determine the jury's calculus of guilt in the case of US vs. Karen Fletcher. In the end, the case did not go to trial. Fletcher, a recluse living on disability payments, opted to accept a plea bargain. One of her lawyers, Lawrence Walters, stated that his client, who has agoraphobia, a fear of public places, is not capable of sitting through what likely would be a week-long trial. Under the proposed plea agreement, Fletcher would avoid prison and be sentenced to a term of home detention. In the view of some legal scholars, Fletcher's guilty plea will not set any precedent related to text-only obscenity prosecutions because she is entering the plea voluntarily. On August 7, 2008, Karen Fletcher was sentenced to five years of probation, including six months of home detention, and forfeiture of her computer after pleading guilty to obscenity charges for running a Web site that featured fictional text stories that were sexual and violent in nature. =Daniel Zehr (2004)= The case focuses on an Amish man, Daniel Zehr, who is seeking an exception to a law which requires that a photo be taken for one to receive legal residence in the United States. A lawsuit filed by the Amish is highly unusual in nature since the Amish hold a steadfast view that they should be non-confrontational. The lawsuit relates to a first amendment argument centered on freedom of religion. Zehr is a Canadian citizen. He is a member of an Old Order Amish sect that takes literally the Bible's prohibition of graven images, which is why he has refused to consent to an immigration photo. In June 2001, Zehr entered the United States and married his wife, Ruth Anne. He has since lived in Licking Township in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, about northeast of Pittsburgh, where he has raised two children. In December 2003, Zehr traveled back to Canada to visit his father, who had suffered a heart attack. On his return to the United States in January 2004, Zehr was stopped at the border and told that he had \\"self-deported\\" and could not return to the United States because he did not have a photo ID. As Zehr's religious beliefs prohibited photo images being taken, he stated he was willing to be fingerprinted and his lawyers argued that fingerprints are a better way to confirm a person's identity. Federal prosecutors refused the request and released a statement noting that a photo is crucial to Department of Homeland Security officials who do background checks of anyone seeking alien status or citizenship and denied such a request. In response to the denial, Zehr filed a lawsuit that argues that the photo requirement violates their religious freedom. Through filing his lawsuit against the photo requirement, Zehr risks being excommunicated from his Amish Sect for violation of their belief in nonresistance. The case is still pending. =United States vs. John Eastman and United States vs. Albert McKelvey= In November 2005, federal prosecutors charged two veterans with falsifying their rank and award recognition. John Eastman was accused of wearing a major's insignia at a Veterans Day function on November 4, 2004. Albert McKelvey was accused of wearing a colonel's uniform at a military function on Memorial Day 2004. While both men had military experience, neither had achieved these ranks. In Buchanan's statement to the press, she stated: \\"To have individuals simply impersonate officers is an offense we have to address to preserve the integrity of the military service.\\" The cases were filed during the high point of the debate concerning the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. Specific new provisions in the Act included granting more authority to federal law enforcement officers, extending the scope of enforcement beyond the Medal of Honor, broadening the law to cover false claims whereas previously an overt act had to be committed, covering mailing and shipping of medals, and protecting the reputation and meaning of military heroism medals. Neither individual received jail time. Eastman pleaded guilty to the charge of impersonating an officer and received two years probation and a $500 fine. McKelvey was ordered to pay a $2,500 fine. =United States vs. Dr. Cyril H. Wecht (2008)= Dr. Cyril Wecht, a former Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner and medical examiner, is a prominent Democrat in the Pittsburgh area. In January 2006, Wecht was indicted by Buchanan on 84 counts of fraud and theft relating to using his public office for private gain. Wecht's lawyers argued that some of these charges involved $3.96 worth of faxes, and $1,778.55 worth of gasoline and mileage bills charged to the state. Buchanan was known for her high-profile prosecutions and investigations of prominent Democrats such as Sheriff Pete DeFazio, the mayor Tom Murphy, and a county judge, Joseph Jaffe. Before Wecht's trial, the prosecution moved to dismiss 43 of the 84 counts without prejudice. The judge rejected the motion and dismissed the 43 charges with prejudice, which permanently bars the revival of the charges. Wecht's defense counsel argued that his prosecution was politically motivated. The initial indictment was announced in early 2006, before the November 2006 elections. During the trial, the judge barred the defense from arguing that the case was politically motivated. Although discussions about possible political motivations were not allowed during the trial, the jury foreman told reporters after the trial that some jurors began to see the prosecution as \\"political\\". \\"I don't know if politically motivated or not, but it seemed to me that the motivations were certainly less than pure. There was something behind it other than seeking justice.\\" At trial, Wecht's defense team put forth no witnesses and focused solely on cross-examining the prosecution witnesses. Wecht's criminal court case ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to agree on a verdict on all 41 remaining counts. The prosecution immediately moved to retry Wecht, and the second trial was scheduled by the trial judge less than two months later, on May 27, 2008. However, on May 8 a three judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued an indefinite stay in the trial proceedings. University of Pittsburgh law professor, John Burkoff characterized Buchanan's decision to attempt a re-trial as one that required perspective: \\"It's getting beyond embarrassing. We're nearing humiliation.\\" The controversial charges resulted in Former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's testimony before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee investigating the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys. Thornburgh acted as a defense lawyer for Dr. Cyril Wecht, and testified that Wecht, \\"would qualify as an ideal target for a Republican U.S. attorney (Buchanan) trying to curry favor with a department which demonstrated that if you play by its rules, you will advance.\\" As a result of Thornburgh's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee, and the public speculation as to the merits of the case, the committee opened an investigation to review the Wecht case, in addition to the review of Governor Don Siegelman's trial. On May 5, 2008, the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) revealed that it initiated an investigation into the Wecht prosecution due to claims that the case was a \\"selective prosecution\\". On June 26, 2008, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law issued a subpoena for all documents related to the case of Dr. Wecht. The Subcommittee issued the subpoena in conjunction with a request for similar documents in the case of Governor Siegelman under the heading \\"Selective Prosecution\\". In the end, Buchanan was forced to forgo a new trial and dismiss the remaining charges against Wecht due to the new judge overseeing the case tossing the majority of the government's evidence against Wecht. In deciding to exclude the evidence, the judge referenced Fourth Amendment violations committed by Buchanan's office in the improper execution of the government's initial warrant to search Wecht's office. Through the government's voluntary decision to dismiss all charges, Wecht has been effectively cleared of all charges initially brought against him within the government's indictment. Alleged involvement in U.S. Attorney dismissal controversy Buchanan was allegedly involved in the firing of the U.S. Attorneys for not embarking on politically motivated prosecutions. The congressional committee investigation has focused on whether nine U.S. attorneys were fired by the Justice Department because they had prosecuted Republicans or did not press charges against Democrats. The controversy is known as the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. In April 2007, Kyle Sampson, the former Gonzales aide, mentioned Buchanan's name to judiciary committee investigators during his April testimony. Sampson said that Buchanan was among the DOJ officials he consulted about which of the U.S. attorneys should be asked to resign. In May 2007, Monica Goodling told committee members that she knew Buchanan had discussed the firings with Sampson. Before Goodling joined the White House, Goodling was hired by Buchanan to work in the executive office. In addition to having Goodling and Sampson allege she was involved in the firing decisions, critics of Buchanan have claimed that she has embarked on several high-profile public corruption cases that exclusively targeted Democratic politicians such as former Sheriff Pete DeFazio, former Mayor Tom Murphy and former Allegheny County Medical Examiner Cyril Wecht. One critic, Allegheny County Democratic Chairman Jim Burn, said that \\"Her record speaks for itself. I've seen a long line of Democrats and mistakes aren't made based on party affiliation but I haven't seen anybody from the other side going through that system.\\" Burn pointed to the fact that Buchanan's Office refused to investigate former Republican Senator Rick Santorum, who got a tuition reimbursement for his children by claiming a Penn Hills, Pennsylvania residency while his family spent most of its time in Virginia, as an example of an alleged double standard. \\"You have to ask yourself the misrepresentations of a Republican such as Rick Santorum made about his alleged residency in Penn Hills were significant,\\" said Burn. After learning this information, the House Judiciary Committee requested an interview with Buchanan in June 2006. Committee staff members privately questioned Buchanan. She had served as director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys in 2004 and 2005 when discussions were held within the Justice Department concerning which of the country's 93 top federal prosecutors should be dismissed. Buchanan has denied any involvement in the firings. Buchanan has also denied that the prosecutions of key Democratic politicians in the Western PA area was driven by political factors. Since the interview, the Judiciary Committee has continued its investigation. On April 17, 2008, the Judiciary Committee released a report which provided some of the details into the investigation into the US Attorney firings. The report stated it was impossible to know if Wecht's prosecution was politically motivated because the Justice Department has not turned over certain documents to committee investigators, and U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Schwab has refused to hold a hearing on Wecht's claim of selective prosecution. Congressional campaign Buchanan announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district in 2010. She faced attorney and former Homeland Security Department official Keith Rothfus in the Republican primary for the right to challenge incumbent Democratic Congressman Jason Altmire. In opposition, two of her former targets for prosecution, Tommy Chong and Cyril Wecht, appeared together at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Hall in Pittsburgh for a comic fundraiser for the Allegheny County Democratic Committee.Chong and Wecht form an unlikely alliance against Buchanan In the May 18 primary, Buchanan was defeated by Rothfus, losing by a margin of 67% to 33%.Rothfus trounces Buchanan in 4th Congressional See also United States v.

This contrasts with an analog signal, which represents continuous values; at any given time it represents a real number within a continuous range of values. Simple digital signals represent information in discrete bands of analog levels. All levels within a band of values represent the same information state. In most digital circuits, the signal can have two possible valid values; this is called a binary signal or logic signal. They are represented by two voltage bands: one near a reference value (typically termed as ground or zero volts), and the other a value near the supply voltage. These correspond to the two values \\"zero\\" and \\"one\\" (or \\"false\\" and \\"true\\") of the Boolean domain, so at any given time a binary signal represents one binary digit (bit). Because of this discretization, relatively small changes to the analog signal levels do not leave the discrete envelope, and as a result are ignored by signal state sensing circuitry. As a result, digital signals have noise immunity; electronic noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect digital circuits, whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog signals to some degree. Digital signals having more than two states are occasionally used; circuitry using such signals is called multivalued logic. For example, signals that can assume three possible states are called three-valued logic. In a digital signal, the physical quantity representing the information may be a variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or polarization of an optical or other electromagnetic field, acoustic pressure, the magnetization of a magnetic storage media, etcetera. Digital signals are used in all digital electronics, notably computing equipment and data transmission. A received digital signal may be impaired by noise and distortions without necessarily affecting the digits Definitions The term digital signal has related definitions in different contexts. =In digital electronics= PAM digital signal In digital electronics, a digital signal is a pulse train (a pulse amplitude modulated signal), i.e. a sequence of fixed-width square wave electrical pulses or light pulses, each occupying one of a discrete number of levels of amplitude. A special case is a logic signal or a binary signal, which varies between a low and a high signal level. The pulse trains in digital circuits are typically generated by metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field- effect transistor (MOSFET) devices, due to their rapid on‚Äìoff electronic switching speed and large-scale integration (LSI) capability. In contrast, BJT transistors more slowly generate analog signals resembling sine waves. =In signal processing= In signal processing, a digital signal is an abstraction that is discrete in time and amplitude, meaning it only exists at certain time instants. In digital signal processing, a digital signal is a representation of a physical signal that is a sampled and quantized. A digital signal is an abstraction that is discrete in time and amplitude. The signal's value only exists at regular time intervals, since only the values of the corresponding physical signal at those sampled moments are significant for further digital processing. The digital signal is a sequence of codes drawn from a finite set of values.Vinod Kumar Khanna, Digital Signal Processing , 2009: A digital signal is a special form of discrete-time signal which is discrete in both time and amplitude, obtained by permitting each value (sample) of a discrete- time signal to acquire a finite set of values (quantization), assigning it a numerical symbol according to a code ... A digital signal is a sequence or list of numbers drawn from a finite set. The digital signal may be stored, processed or transmitted physically as a pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal. =In communications= A frequency shift keying (FSK) signal is alternating between two waveforms and allows passband transmission. It is considered a means of digital data transmission. AMI coded digital signal used in baseband transmission (line coding) In digital communications, a digital signal is a continuous-time physical signal, alternating between a discrete number of waveforms, Analogue and Digital Communication Techniques : \\"A digital signal is a complex waveform and can be defined as a discrete waveform having a finite set of levels\\" representing a bitstream. The shape of the waveform depends the transmission scheme, which may be either a line coding scheme allowing baseband transmission; or a digital modulation scheme, allowing passband transmission over long wires or over a limited radio frequency band. Such a carrier-modulated sine wave is considered a digital signal in literature on digital communications and data transmission,J.S.Chitode, Communication Systems, 2008: \\"When a digital signal is transmitted over a long distance, it needs CW modulation.\\" but considered as a bitstream converted to an analog signal in electronics and computer networking.Fred Halsall, Computer Networking and the Internet: \\"In order to transmit a digital signal over an analog subscriber line, modulated transmission must be used; thas is the electrical signal that represents the binary bit stream of the source (digital) output must first be converted to an analog signal that is compatible with a (telephony) speech signal.\\" In communications, sources of interference are usually present, and noise is frequently a significant problem. The effects of interference are typically minimized by filtering off interfering signals as much as possible and by using data redundancy. The main advantages of digital signals for communications are often considered to be the noise immunity to noise capability, and the ability, in many cases such as with audio and video data, to use data compression to greatly decrease the bandwidth that is required on the communication media. Logic voltage levels A logic signal waveform: (1) low level, (2) high level, (3) rising edge, and (4) falling edge. A waveform that switches representing the two states of a Boolean value (0 and 1, or low and high, or false and true) is referred to as a digital signal or logic signal or binary signal when it is interpreted in terms of only two possible digits. The two states are usually represented by some measurement of an electrical property: Voltage is the most common, but current is used in some logic families. Two ranges of voltages are typically defined for each logic family, which are frequently not directly adjacent. The signal is low when in the low range and high when in the high range, and in between the two ranges the behaviour can vary between different types of gates. The clock signal is a special digital signal that is used to synchronize many digital circuits. The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal. Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge. The rising edge is the transition from a low voltage (level 1 in the diagram) to a high voltage (level 2). The falling edge is the transition from a high voltage to a low one. Although in a highly simplified and idealized model of a digital circuit, we may wish for these transitions to occur instantaneously, no real world circuit is purely resistive and therefore no circuit can instantly change voltage levels. This means that during a short, finite transition time the output may not properly reflect the input, and will not correspond to either a logically high or low voltage. Modulation To create a digital signal, an analog signal must be modulated with a control signal to produce it. The simplest modulation, a type of unipolar encoding, is simply to switch on and off a DC signal so that high voltages represent a '1' and low voltages are '0'. In digital radio schemes one or more carrier waves are amplitude, frequency or phase modulated by the control signal to produce a digital signal suitable for transmission. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) over telephone wires, does not primarily use binary logic; the digital signals for individual carriers are modulated with different valued logics, depending on the Shannon capacity of the individual channel. Clocking Clocking digital signals through a clocked flip-flop Digital signals may be sampled by a clock signal at regular intervals by passing the signal through a flip-flop. When this is done, the input is measured at the clock edge, and the signal from that time. The signal is then held steady until the next clock. This process is the basis of synchronous logic.

It was formerly known as Run153 or described as \\"wastelands of the Crown\\". In June 1857, Wrey and Herbert Seymour relocated 2500 sheep on the ship Taranaki from Nelson, New Zealand to stock Run153. This was the start of Wreys Bush. Walter ended up building a sod and a thatch hut (site of the future Annandale homestead), and he lived there for about two weeks; he died at the infant settlement of Invercargill. Pioneer diaries described Wreys Bush as \\"desolate bush\\" and \\"spurs more holey than righteous\\". William Johnston ended up being the owner of Annadale in 1869. Wreys Bush was a popular stopover for wagoners, drovers and gold miners; they usually stayed at one of the Wreys Bush hotels. Annadale eventually got split up into farms which were owned by Irish farmers; most of them were Catholic. In 1899 St Peter's Convent School was opened and was run by the Sisters of Mercy. Before 1899 there was Wreys Bush Public School; after the opening of the convent school, the public school only had one non-Catholic student; they had no choice but to close down the school. It is unknown where the public school used to stand; however, the convent still stands today (now used as a home), but the school itself doesn't stand today. In 1901 there was a population of 289 according to the 1901 census, there were two pubs, two stores, a blacksmith, a saddler, a bootmaker and other services. There was a church, but there is very little information known. The church is not standing today, but the priest's house still is. The church was demolished because the people of Wreys Bush did not want it to turn into a hay-barn. When coal was discovered in Nightcaps, the sisters opened a new school, St Patricks (it is still a school today), in Nightcaps in 1917. In 1936 St Peter's closed (Wreys Bush). They also had a convent in Nightcaps; this convent is now a bed & breakfast in Te Anau, New Zealand. Wreys Bush stopped and was forgotten because of the discovery of coal. Today in Wreys Bush the Wreys Bush Pub is still in business known as \\"The Bush\\" (the other pub is gone with the blacksmith, bootmaker two stores, saddler and the church); there is also a gun club and a car service garage.

History Mother Mary Aikenhead, who had founded the Religious Sisters of Charity in 1815 in Dublin, Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was requested by John Bede Polding, O.S.B., the first Catholic bishop in Australia, to send some Sisters to help the many female convicts who had been transported to Australia as penalty for their crimes. Arriving in New South Wales, then still a colony of the British Empire, on the Francis Spaight on 31 December 1838 the Sisters who had volunteered to go to Australia from Ireland were the first Religious Sisters to set foot on the Australian continent. The Sisters of Charity of Australia have operated independently of the congregation in Ireland since 1842. St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, was founded by the Sisters in 1857. In 1925, the Sisters of Charity ventured to Queensland, Australia to open a school, Mt St Michael's College - originally known as Grantuly until 1941 - in Ashgrove. The spirituality of the Sisters of Charity derives from the life of St. Vincent de Paul and the vision of Mary Aikenhead, their foundress. In addition to the three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, the Sisters of Charity take a fourth vow, of service to the poor. For the Sisters of Charity, \\"Service of the Poor\\" denotes not only the alleviation of a present affliction by immediate action, but also includes having a \\"preferential option for the poor\\". Services The ministries of the Sisters of Charity of Australia have been varied in nature from the time of their founding. From ministering in prisons to managing hospitals and acting to conserve environments, they have been quick to \\"read the signs of the times\\" and move to where they have been most needed, in the greatest service to the poor. One of their most prominent ministries was the establishment of St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857. St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne was opened in 1893. The health care ministries of St Vincent's Health Australia are now under the stewardship of Mary Aikenhead Ministries. In 1957, the Sisters opened Mt Olivet Hospital as a hospice in Brisbane. It now provides a wider range of hospital services and has been renamed St Vincent's Private Hospital.

The title wijnmeester was reserved for sons of members, and he was the son of Jan Collaert I and Anna van der Heijden. He married Justa Galle, the daughter of the man he worked for, Philip Galle. He also worked for Gerard de Jode (where he made prints after Maerten de Vos), Eduard Hoeswinckel and Hans van Luyck. After having learnt the principles of the art in his own country, he visited Italy for improvement, where he passed some years. On his return to Flanders, he engraved a great number of plates, executed in a neatly finished style, but with a certain degree of dryness. He died at Antwerp in 1618. His drawing is correct, and his heads expressive. He sometimes marked his plates with a cipher. From 1593-94 he took on pupils and from 1589 he worked for Plantijn Moretus.

Qureshi was accompanied by his driver, Rustam Khan, and two senior members of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Khalid Khawaja and Colonel Imam during his trip. All four were abducted; Khawaja was killed and his body was found a month later in Mir Ali with an attached note accusing him of spying for the United States and being responsible for killing people during the Siege of Lal Masjid. Qureshi and his driver were released in September 2010 through family negotiations after 165 days of captivity. Colonel Imam was executed in January 2011. Qureshi's release was a rare occurrence as the Pakistani Taliban have been known to execute most of their victims. Qureshi has British Pakistani origins. He has a reputation as an experienced filmmaker, and prior to being detained, he had been based in Pakistan for over five years. It was not his first visit to Waziristan. In 2009 he made \\"The Battle of Swat Valley\\" for the BBC's Panorama, charting the army action taken in Swat against the Taliban. In April 2011 his film Defusing Human Bombs was screened in Pakistan; it shows the rehabilitation of children kidnapped by the Taliban and trained to be suicide bombers. He had started the film in September 2009 and the project was put on hold when he was kidnapped. He then continued the project after his release. Usman Punjabi, who planned the kidnap, was killed two weeks before Qureshi's release and Sabir Mehsud, the leader of the Asian Tigers, was himself kidnapped by Hakimullah Mehsud.

In 2009 the national Comprehensive Rural Development Programme (CRDP) identified Muyexe as one of the poorest villages in South Africa, noting that it lacked basic services such as water, electricity, proper roads, or adequate housing. The CRDP promised to help the local farmers farm more productively by providing tractors and other agricultural equipment. The Minister for Rural Development and Land Reform, Gugile Nkwinti, his Deputy, Dr Joe Phaahla, and the Limpopo Premier, Cassel Mathale, promised to visit the village from time to time to supervise the work and make sure that community members were getting better services. In 2011, the CRDP declared the project at Muyexe to be a success, with the majority of the needs of the 900 households in the village having been met. However, as of 2011 adequate water remained a serious problem as there was no permanent water supply, no tractor yet had been supplied, and jobs remained scarce. By 2013, despite equipping boreholes with pumps and installing a water purification plant,The water from the boreholes was high in nitrates, way in excessive of drinking water standards, and the levels of fluoride, magnesium and chloride also exceeded those standards. residents still did not have access to piped water, and poverty and unemployment remained major problems.

He was known for his uprightness and fearlessness while carrying out his duties in the face of political opposition. He was brought to trial for supposed insubordination and heavy-handedness but was cleared of these charges. He is still hailed as a hero of the middle-class Indian. Early life He was born in the family of a farmer on 14 April 1942, in the village named Pimpalgaon (wakhari) taluka Deola district Nashik. He had twin elder brothers who tended to the family farming while his father became a middle man for local produce. Khairnar graduated from Bhikusa Yamasa Kshatriya College of Commerce, Nasik, Maharashtra studying in Marathi medium, which later led to difficulties with English. He graduated with honours and was awarded \\"ideal student\\" award from the college. While at the college he also participated in National Cadet Corps. Career In 1964 he joined the state services in Maharashtra as Upper Division Clerk. =With BMC= In 1974, he joined the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation BMC) as accounts officer. In 1985, as a ward officer he took on then chief minister Vasantdada Patil when he demolished \\"Step In\\", a hotel run by the CM's son Chandrakant. In 1988, he became a Deputy Commissioner in BMC. In 1993, he took on the then Chief Minister Sharad Pawar calling him corrupt and unethical. In 1994, he was suspended after an inquiry committee headed by a High Court judge found him guilty of various charges including overstepping of authority and specifically of making \\"willful mistatements\\". In 1995, the Bhartiya Janta Party and Shiv- Sena combined to take up Khairnar's cause in the run up to elections and managed to wipe out the Congress. While the suspension was being contested in court, Khairnar was variously harassed; he was even asked to vacate his house of 15 years to make way for a swimming pool superintendent. Eventually, the High Court passed judgement ordering the reinstation of Khairnar, but the new government refused to comply. In 1995, he joined hands with Anna Hazare to fight for his cause. In 1997, he won a case against BMC alleging that he had been unjustly suspended due to political pressure. Despite this he was not fully awarded the court's mandate until 2000 when he was reinstated as the Deputy Commissioner. From 2000 to 2002, Khairnar once again lived up to the title of \\"One Man Demolition Army\\" by fighting back land mafias and clearing public land of encroachments, even suffering injuries in doing so. In 2002, the then Municipal Commissioner V. Ranganathan did not extend the retirement age of Khairnar and he had to retire. The popular opinion was that the then Mayor Hareshwar Patil of the Shiv Sena was against the continuation of Khairnar's services. In an ironic turn of events, upon his retirement, his position of Deputy Commissioner (Special ‚Äì Demolitions) was temporarily handed to Chandrashekhar Rokde, the IPS officer who had served him eviction notice during his suspension. Then his successor, Kalam Patil, was allegedly caught by the Anti Corruption Bureau(ACB) accepting an INR 250,000 bribe and while under investigation, was appointed by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation(MSRDC) as their Commercial Officer as well as Public Relations Officer(PRO). He was acquitted by the court subsequently. He is serving collector of Sangli District. =Post BMC= During his suspension from BMC, he wrote his autobiography Ekaki Zunj (The Lonely Fight) in Marathi in 1995. Although he first followed Anna Hazare for guidance in social work, he later found Hazare to be too politically aligned for his liking and set off independently. Khairnar was known for rescuing minor girls from human trafficking and prostitution. He used eunuchs to rescue minor girls from Kamathipura, a red light district in Mumbai. This was an innovative spin on the practice of loan collection agents to send eunuchs to debtors' homes to embarrass them into repaying debts. Khairnar later took up living in Bibipura village in Sabarkhata District, 70 km from Ahmedabad, working on a few development projects in rural Gujarat, funded by a US-based non-governmental organisation. While in Gujarat his health suffered a setback due to his experiments with naturopathy and thereby lacking essential salts in his body.

A princely-priest by profession at the court of the raja of Khurda, Rajaguru revolted against the British Raj in the province. Whilst collaborating with the Marathas to recapture the British- occupied province, a Maratha messenger was caught by the British army and Rajaguru's secret strategies got exposed. Upon failure of his removal from the king's court, the British force attacked the fort of Khurda and captured Rajaguru. He was later sentenced to death by tying his legs to the branches of a banyan tree in Baghitota, Midnapore.  Early life  Jayi Rajaguru was born on 29 October 1739 (occasion of Anla nabami as per the Odia calendar) in Biraharekrushnapur, near Puri, Odisha to father Chandra Rajaguru and mother Haramani Debi. He was the Royal Priest, Commander-in-Chief and the real administrative representative of the king of Khurda, Gajapati Mukunda Deva-II. He is supposedly known, in written history, as first martyr of India against the British. However, this is disputed because he was mainly fighting against the threat imposed by the British towards the seizure of his feudal lands, rather than for the independence of either Odisha or India. However, later, the Paika Rebellion, under Bakshi Jagabandhu, is thought to be the first rebellion among Odias against the British. Royal responsibilities Being an excellent scholar in Sanskrit like his grandfather Gadadhara Rajaguru and a great Tantra Sadhaka, he was appointed as the Chief Minister-cum-Rajaguru of Gajapati Dibyasingha Deva in the year 1780 at the age of 41. He was a lifelong bachelor. He was also the royal priest of Gajapati Mukunda Dev-II. In 1779, during the war between the Khurda King and Januji Bhonsala at Badamba Gada, Narasingha Rajaguru was killed who was handling the army. In this precarious condition Jayi Rajaguru was appointed as the head of the administration and the chief of Army of Khurda and carried out his duties till his death. Revolt against the intruders = Burgis = Taking advantage of the weak administration during the battles, the attack of Burgis was become intensified on the people of Khurda. This was intolerable to the patriot Rajaguru. He personally moved from village to village to encourage the moral strength of the Paiks (soldiers). He organized village youths and trained them in military practices and making arms and ammunition. He developed a five-point programme (Panchasutri Yojana) to fight against the Burgis. =British= However, the main trouble started in 1757 when the British won the battle of plassey and occupied the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Medinapur in Odisha. In 1765 they occupied a vast region of Andhra Pradesh from the Parsis and the Nizam of Hyderabad. They built a fort in Ganjam south to Khurda. For the purpose of transportation between Ganjam and Medinapur, they attacked Khurda in 1798 with the help of Shyamsundara Deva, the treacherous brother of the king of Khurda. Even with the sudden death of Khurda King Gajapati Dibyasingha Dev at that particular time, Rajaguru did not let them to succeed in their effort. Rajaguru Supported Mukunda Dev-II and made him the king of Khurda. The District Magistrate of Ganjam Col. Harcourt made an agreement with the king of Khurda for the communication of Ganjam and Balasore. It was agreed that the British would pay one lakh Rupees ( 1, 00,000) towards compensation to the king and to return the four Praganas which were under the control of the Marathas since 1760 A.D. But, they cheated in both the ways. Rajaguru tried his best to get the both, but was unsuccessful. In 1803‚Äì04, he marched with two thousand armed Paiks to Cuttack to collect the money but was only paid 40,000 and was refused to get the Praganas. Fight Filled with rage Rajaguru rearranged his army and occupied the four Praganas on his own with an intention to drive the British out of his state, his country. But, the British tried to capture Khurda by force. As a result, in September 1804 the King of Khurda was deprived of the traditional rights of Jagannatha Temple which was a serious shock to the King and the people of Odisha. Consequently, in October 1804 a group of armed Paikas attacked the British at Pipili. This event alarmed the British force. In the meantime, Rajaguru requested all the Kings of the State to join hands for a common cause against the British. The Kings of Kujanga, Kanika, Harishapura, Marichipura and others made an alliance with the King of Khurda and prepared themselves for the battle. Finally, the historical fight occurred between the military of Khurda and the British. Fight continued for a long period and Rajaguru was arrested from the Khurdha fort and was taken to Barabati fort. He made his all out effort to keep his king safe but finally, Mukunda Deva-II was arrested on 3 January 1805. Then Rajaguru and the King were sent to Midnapore Jail from Cuttack, fearing further violence in the State. Trial and execution Considering the petition submitted by the king from the prison, the British counsels released Mukunda Deva-II and sent him to Puri for settlement. The trial of Rajaguru was conducted at Baghitota in Medinapur. He was declared guilty for waging a war \\"against the lawfully established Govt. of the land\\". He was ordered to be hanged till death; but was brutally killed on 6 December 1806 in a procedure in which executioners tied his legs to the opposite branches of a tree and the branches were let off splitting his body in to two parts.

Opened in 1968, it is named after a former Minister of Transport Ben Schoeman, and is undoubtedly the busiest road in South Africa. Route The Ben Schoeman Highway begins under the designation of the M1, just north of the Corlett Drive exit, where the M1 is no longer under the maintenance of the Johannesburg Roads Agency. The M1 ends at the Buccleuch interchange with the N3 and N1 highways. The highway then becomes the N1 and passes through Midrand and Centurion. Here, the N1 splits from the Ben Schoeman Highway at the Brakfontein interchange - heading to the eastern suburbs of Pretoria and to Polokwane. From the Buccleuch Interchange to the Brakfontein Interchange the Ben Schoeman Highway is a toll road, part of the Gauteng e-toll system. From Brakfontein Interchange the Ben Schoeman Highway continues northwards, directly into Pretoria, ending as it becomes Potgieter Street. Here it is under the designation of N14. The highway was in fact opened in the reverse order, beginning in 1968 with the section from Potgieter Street to just south of Brakfontein. The second section to be opened ran from Brakfontein to just south of the then Halfway House. The final section linked up the highway to the Buccleuch Interchange and Old Pretoria Main Road. The Section of the road designated as the N1 Road, Between Buccleuch and Brakfontein is part of the famed Cape to Cairo Road. Maintenance and upgrades The Ben Schoeman Highway is maintained from just north of the Corlett Drive (M30) exit before Sandton until the N14/N1 split at the Brakfontein Interchange in Centurion by SANRAL. However, only the portion between the Buccleuch and Brakfontein interchanges is tolled. From Brakfontein Interchange to Potgieter Street in Pretoria, the highway is maintained by the Gauteng Provincial Government. Two major upgrades have been done on the Ben Schoeman Highway, which was initially 2 lanes in each direction from Potgieter Street to Corlett Drive. a)The first upgrade in the late 1980s saw the section between Buccleuch and Brakfontein Interchanges upgraded to a minimum of 3 lanes in each direction. The highway was completely rebuilt using concrete. New interchanges were added at the New Road and Samrand Avenue. b)The second major upgrade of the highway, also from Buccleuch interchange to the Brakfontein Interchange was part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project. The highway was upgraded from 3 lanes to 4 - 5 lanes in each direction, although between the Buccleuch Interchange and the M39 Alandale Interchange this has been increased to 6 lanes. Although concrete underlies some of the lanes for heavy/slow traffic, the road surface is now tar for the entire length of the Ben Schoeman Highway. To fund this second upgrade, there are two electronic tolling gantries in each direction of the highway. The Highway has also been upgraded between Corlett Drive and the Buccleuch Interchange, although this section is not tolled, and consists of 3/4 lanes in each direction. Lighting is found along the highway from Brakfontein Interchange to Corlett Drive. The Highway now includes upgraded overhead signage as well as electronic signage. The northern section of the highway between Brakfontein Interchange and Potgieter Street has not been upgraded, although the road has been resurfaced at times. It remains 2 lanes in each direction, does not have central lighting, and does not have any overhead signage. As a result of the Gautrain route, the diamond interchange at Trichardt Street was changed, and so north bound traffic now exits to Sunderland Road and no longer Trichardt Street. Major interchanges The two main interchanges on the Ben Schoeman highway are the Buccleuch Interchange (with the N3 Eastern Bypass and N1 Western Bypass), where the Ben Schoeman Highway changes from M1 to N1 designation, and the Brakfontein Interchange (with the N1 Danie Joubert Freeway - Pretoria Eastern Bypass - and N14 to Krugersdorp), where the Highway changes from N1 to N14 designation. The interchange between the N1 and M39 (formerly the R561), known as the Allandale Interchange, was completely redesigned as part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project and is the only other free flowing interchange on the Ben Schoeman Highway.
