The population was 2,162 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. History The water tower in Pequot Lakes is decorated like a fishing bobber. Pequot Lakes was platted in March 1900. It was named by a postal official for the first Indian-sounding name he thought of, which is the name of a former tribe of Algonquian Indians in eastern Connecticut. A post office was established at Pequot Lakes in 1896. According to the Pequot Lakes Heritage Preservation Commission, the city once called Sibley and Frogtown was renamed as Pequot. In 1900, Walter and Flora Brown filed their plat for the E 1/2 of the SW 1/4 section 10 in T136N-R29W under the title Pequot. The Pequot Indians are a tribe that used to dominate southeastern New England before the English colonists arrived. While no Pequot tribe members lived in Minnesota, they spoke an Algonquian language related to that of the local Chippewa (Ojibwe) tribes. Author Herman Melville named his lead ship in his novel Moby-Dick as the Pequod. Two possible explanations for the town's name arise: ''' 1\\\\. The local historian Carl Zapffe suggests that a variation of the Chippewa word for arrow (bikwas), as listed by Father Barroga in his Chippewa dictionary, gave rise to the word Pequot. 2\\\\. In a 1936 interview, Laurence Anderson, who moved to the town in the mid-1890s, gave the following explanation. \\"A daughter of 'Waubanaquot,' Chief of the White Earth tribe, was named 'O-Pequot' and lived north of the town on the north end of Sibley Lake. She graciously allowed her dugout home to be used as a school and a church for the early settlers of the town. When she died, she was buried in the town cemetery.\\" Because there was already a town named Sibley in southwest Minnesota, the U.S. Post Office said the second Sibley had to take a new name. In any event, the town officially became Pequot in 1902. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city lies on the south bank of the Minnesota River, upstream from its confluence with the Mississippi River. Burnsville and nearby suburbs form the southern portion of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, the fifteenth largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.6 million residents. According Burnsville has many attractions, including its regional mall, Burnsville Center. The city is also a recreational attraction with Alimagnet Dog Park, a section of Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve and vertical ski peak Buck Hill. Minnesota River wildlife is protected by the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Originally a rural Irish farming community, Burnsville became the tenth largest city in Minnesota in the 2000 Census following the construction of Interstate 35. Currently the ninth largest suburb in the metro area and a bedroom community of both Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the city was fully built by the late 2000s. Burnsville's downtown area is called Heart of the City with urban-style retail and condominiums. The Burnsville Transit Station serves as the hub and headquarters of the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority, providing regional bus service to five other suburbs. The name Burnsville is attributed to an early Irish settler and land owner, William Byrne. His surname was recorded as \\"Burns\\" and was never corrected. History The Mdewakanton Dakota were the earliest inhabitants who came through the Minnesota River, following water fowl and game animals. As part of the greater migration of the Mdewakanton from their ancestral area around Mille Lacs Lake to the river confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, Chief Black Dog, around 1750, established his band at a permanent village at the isthmus between Black Dog Lake (from which is named after him) and the Minnesota River, near the present site of the Black Dog Power Plant. The permanent camp was reported by early settlers as being inhabited by over 250 Dakota. At the south end of Burnsville, Crystal Lake, recorded as \\"Minne Elk\\" was utilized for abundant fish, leisure and burial. It was also a gathering spot where Dakota watched deer or bucks drink at the lake from the top of Buck Hill, in which was named by early settlers who witnessed this activity. Three large burial mounds were discovered after European settlement. Horses baling straw circa 1900.The Dakota nation ceded land in 1851 and many relocated to Chief Shakopee's village‚Äîthe current Shakopee- Mdewakanton Indian Reservation in nearby Prior Lake. The first European settlers were Irish, Scottish and Norwegian farmers who came upriver from Saint Paul. One of these Irish settlers was William Byrne, who had immigrated in 1840 from County Kilkenny, Ireland to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. In 1855, he settled at the present day junction of County Road 34 and Judicial Road near the Scott County line, just southeast of old downtown Savage. He subsequently donated land there for a church, school, and a cemetery as well as serving Town Chairman. In 1858, the Dakota County Board authorized Byrnsville Township in the north by the Minnesota River, east by Eagan and Apple Valley, south by Lakeville, and west by Scott County. There is some ambiguity of if the name actually derived from William Byrne since there were people with the surname \\"Burns\\" living in the area (a Scottish variant). The Town Clerk recorded variations between \\"Burns\\" and \\"Byrnes\\" but at the 1960s city incorporation, the \\"Burnsville\\" spelling prevailed. The school district was organized during this time as well. Burnsville originally comprised the present-day downtown of Savage (then known as Hamilton) until county border revisions by the legislature. The Irish and Scottish settlers of this time left their names on many area roads and parks and their religion in Presbyterian, Protestant, and Catholic churches. Crystal Lake in 1880. The resort included boats for rent. In the 19th century, Burnsville was considered a long distance from downtown Minneapolis. Rail access came in 1864 and Burnsville became a resort town, with cottages along Crystal Lake as well as Orchard Lake and Marion Lake in nearby Lakeville. The Bloomington Ferry provided river crossings until 1889 when the original Bloomington Ferry Bridge was built. By 1920, the Lyndale Avenue Drawbridge opened next to Black Dog Lake, extending Minneapolis' first north south highway to the rural communities of southern Minnesota. Later the bridge, upgraded several times, would be replaced by the I-35W Minnesota River bridge. In 1950, just before the World War II postwar housing boom, Burnsville was still a quiet township with a population of 583 people. School was taught in a one-room schoolhouse containing eight grades. After the arrival of Interstate 35W in 1960, the next two decades saw the largest boom in population when post-war pressures forced the community to develop at rapid pace. Byrnesville Township was officially incorporated in 1964 after defeating an annexation attempt by the city of Bloomington. and Mass housing development followed and a former mayor, Connie Morrison said city managers had foresight in producing shopping nodes in walking distance of most homes. The city became a regional pull when Burnsville Center opened in 1977 and produced the heavily traveled retail strip on County Road 42. The next decades leading to the 21st century dealt with managing Burnsville's increasing population and growth which led to providing alternative transportation options, diverse housing projects, and ultimately the \\"Heart of the City\\" project. The city approached build-out in the late 1990s and changed focus from new development to redevelopment and rehabilitation of existing structures. Descendants of the Byrne family still remain in greater Minnesota with the original spelling in their surname. A relative who dedicated William Byrne Elementary in the 1960s considered petitioning to correct the spelling but most of the family had moved away for several decades. Geography Fed by receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz 12,000 years ago, the Glacial River Warren carved today's Minnesota River valley. On the northern border of Burnsville, the Minnesota River winds through marshland and flood plains toward its confluence with the Mississippi.

Demographics The earliest settlers were roughly 250 Mdewakanton Dakota who lived permanently at Black Dog camp. Starting in the 1850s, Old stock Americans from the east coast and French Canadians moved into eastern Dakota County near Saint Paul. A decade later, major European immigration began with settlers from Ireland, Scotland, and Great Britain. By the 1900s there were a few Scandinavians from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark but these ethnic groups were mostly concentrated towards Lakeville. Those from Germany and Eastern Europe would gradually join the minority from the packing jobs in nearby South St. Paul. Irish descendants maintained the majority through the early 1950s owing to the town's origin, overall land ownership, and the practice of marrying within ethnic clans. The early 20th century's permanent population remained very low as the Minnesota River's lack of bridges and streetcar connection isolated the area from development, preventing people from moving south of the river. The lake-side houses around Crystal Lake and Orchard Lake however attracted several various immigrant and first-generation wealthier individuals to temporarily settle or own land in the town limits. In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau recorded the population of Byrnesville Township at 2,716 people and soon after, the postwar growth was instantaneous, filling the city with second to third generation European descendants from Minneapolis; more American than ethnic. From 1960 to 1970, the total population accelerated to nearly 20,000 people and by the year 2000, the population arrived at roughly 60,000 people. =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 60,306 people, 24,283 households, and 15,656 families residing in the city.

Government consists of an elected City Council of one executive mayor and four council members. All four council members are elected at-large to serve four-year terms. The Mayorship term was changed from two to four years in 2000. Administrative duties including employment of the city are in charge of the City Manager. As one of many Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan municipalities, the city is required to regularly submit a Comprehensive Plan detailing infrastructure and development progress to the Metropolitan Council. Elizabeth B. Kautz has been mayor since 1995, elected after serving a two years on the Burnsville City Council where she replaced Ken Wolf (R) who was elected to the State House of Representatives in District 41B. Having been re- elected eight times, she has served for over 23 years. Kautz's framework of progressive activity and financial management has been studied and may explain her consecutive re-elections, or it could be that she always seems to run unopposed. She cites in her biography, that she has reduced Burnsville's debt, increased infrastructure improvement, maintained the property tax scheduled decrease, established a new youth center, and oversaw the establishment of the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority. One of her major redevelopment projects has been the Burnsville Heart of the City, identified through community visioning as the intersecting commercial areas near Burnsville Parkway and Nicollet Avenue. In her winning 2008 re-election, the 1,000 seat regional performing arts center component was cited by her opponent as misuse of public funds toward arts.

It is a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, approximately south of both downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul. Lakeville is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Twin Cities area. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated its population to be 67,317 in 2019. Lakeville lies along Interstate Highway 35. Lakeville first became notable in 1910 when Marion Savage built the Dan Patch Railroad Line to service his Antlers Amusement Park. It later became a flourishing milling center; its agriculture industry is still in operation. While many of Lakeville's workers commute northward to Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and more central suburbs like Bloomington, Lakeville has had major industry since the 1960s‚Äîincluding the Airlake Industrial Park, which is served by Airlake Airport, a regional reliever airport. History The Sioux people ceded most of southern Minnesota in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851. A military road was constructed between Fort Snelling and the southern forts. In 1855, J.J. Brackett, a Saint Paul lumber baron and mail carrier using the road, decided to plat a site halfway between Saint Paul and Saint Peter on a lake he named Prairie Lake. The village was established as Lakeville Township in 1858. Notoriety came when Colonel Marion Savage expanded his entertainment business into constructing Antlers Amusement Park in 1910. Riding on fame from his success with the Dan Patch racing horse and the popularity of the park, the lake was renamed Lake Marion, and the rail line servicing the park named the Dan Patch Railroad Line.A Glimpse of Lakeville's' Past Lakeville Area Historical Society With the mostly rural landscape, early settlers were farmers and this owed to a high percentage of Scandinavians. The other group included Irish, Scots, and English who had spread out from Hamilton Landing and Burnsville. In Karen Miller's diary from 1840 to 1895, Danes reportedly outnumbered Norwegians and travel to Minneapolis was not uncommon for the rural township. Enggren's Grocery was a downtown staple since 1900 until it closed in 2006. The later 20th century followed typically for the outer-ring suburban Twin Cities with official incorporation as the City of Lakeville in 1967. The agriculture industry continued to sustain itself as postwar development did not immediately absorb Lakeville (as well as Interstate 35's later completion date). In the early 21st century, housing and population increases were due to rising land costs in the metropolitan area, causing Lakeville to become a boomtown. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Lakeville includes the Argonne Farms post-World War I settlement project which failed in the early 20th century and was redeveloped in the 21st century into typical suburban retail. Since it was a semi-autonomous village within Lakeville Township before the city's incorporation, it continues to appear today on maps as Argonne. A branch of the Vermillion River flows through Lakeville. Its headwaters are just west of the city limits in Credit River Township, and it flows eastward across Dakota County until it empties into the Mississippi River at the Wisconsin border. Much of Lakeville drains into the Vermillion River watershed. North Creek, a major tributary of the Vermillion, begins its flow in northern Lakeville and flows eastward to meet the Vermillion near downtown Farmington just east of Lakeville. The Vermillion River has been designated as a trout stream by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. =Climate= Lakeville's climate is classified as warm- summer humid continental with features of a hot-summer humid continental (K√∂ppen Dfa).  Lakes  As its name implies, Lakeville contains several lakes as well as smaller ponds and wetlands within its borders. The two largest lakes are Lake Marion and Orchard Lake, which are used heavily for recreation such as fishing, boating, and swimming. Smaller named natural lakes include East Lake, Kingsley Lake, Lee Lake and Raven Lake. Valley Lake is a small man-made lake in the northern part of the city.

Education South St. Paul's public school system contains two elementary schools, one secondary school (6-12), and a community-learning center. South St. Paul schools were established in 1853. At that time, the schools operated under the name Kaposia School District, serving the sons and daughters of local residents, missionaries, and the Kaposia Village Native American chiefs. Initially under the jurisdiction of Dakota County, the district included sections of West St. Paul, Sunfish Lake and Inver Grove Heights. In 1887, the county turned over the administration of schools to the newly incorporated cities and their councils. South Saint Paul Special School District #6 was officially designated a school district in 1890, when voters established an independent Board of Education. Rapid growth in the city, and its schools, continued in the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the 1970s when more than 6,000 students attended six elementary schools, a high school, and a junior high school. However, in the 1980s, enrollments in the South St. Paul schools began to decline and the community was forced to make the difficult decision to consolidate school buildings. During the same period, advances in technology required the school district to be networked to keep up with the next generation of learners. In 1999, the South St. Paul community passed a technology referendum to maintain the quality of education in South St. Paul Schools. Currently, The South St. Paul School District serves approximately 3,500 students in two elementary schools, one secondary school (grades 7-12), and an alternative learning center. South St. Paul is also home to two private schools, Holy Trinity Catholic School, & St. John Vianney Catholic School. =Holy Trinity Catholic School= Holy Trinity School opened on September 7, 1954 with an enrollment of 243 students. The building consisted of 8 classrooms and a cafeteria in the basement. The school offered grades Pre-K through 8. After September 7, 1954, the size of the student body expanded at a rapid rate. By the beginning of the 1963-64 school year, the enrollment exceeded 600 students. After a drop in enrollment, attendance bottomed out at 80-plus students during the 1984-85 school year. In this same year, a half-day kindergarten was added to the regular 1-8 grade program. The following year, an all-day everyday kindergarten was established. A preschool was then added in 1988. It has since grown, and now has several more classrooms and athletic programs. =St. John Vianney Catholic School= In 1956, SJV school opened its doors with 109 students in grades one through four. By 1958, the school offered grades one through eight. In 1974, a preschool and kindergarten program were added. The fall of 1992 saw the establishment of a full day kindergarten program, as well as an extended day program. At this time, SJV offered academic programs for preschool, kindergarten and grades 1 through 6, as well as an extended day program. St. John Vianney Catholic School was closed in 2010 by the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis when it was merged with Saint Michael Catholic School of West Saint Paul. The newly merged school/s operate at Saint Michael Catholic School campus as the Community of Saints Regional Catholic School. Saint John Vianney Church now rents out their space to a charter school. Religion =Grace Lutheran Church= Grace Lutheran Church Grace Lutheran Church is a member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) in South St. Paul. =Clark Memorial United Church of Christ= Established on October 25, 1887, CMUCC was founded by Charles W. Clark. The church has gone through many remodels and building changes throughout the years. CMUCC has even been struck by fire, but the faithful parish rebuilt the church. The mission of the church is to support the local, state, national and global interest of the congregation. CMUCC also supports the ministry of the United Church of Christ, as programs and needs arise. The church also participates in citywide events such as Kaposia Days and On the Road Again Days.http://www.clarkmemorialucc.org =St. Stefan Romanian Orthodox Church= St. Stefan Romanian Orthodox Parish was founded in 1923 by Romanian emigrants; but the physical church's construction was finished in 1924. On June 27, 1924, the parish was officially incorporated as a religious non-profit organization. In 1935 the church was blessed by Policarp Morusca, the first Romanian Orthodox Bishop in America. =St Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church= St. Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church of Minnesota originated in the early 1960s, at the urging of Bishop Samuel, who annually visited Coptic student groups at various American universities. At that time, approximately ten Coptic graduate students, some with families at the University of Minnesota, met for Christian worship.http://www.stmarymn.org =Holy Trinity Catholic Parish (Holy Trinity and Saint Augustine Catholic Churches)= The Church of the Holy Trinity was established by Bishop John Ireland in November 1917; but it was not until June 1940 that the first resident pastor, J. F. Siegienski, was assigned. Holy Trinity was originally a Polish parish. The first Mass was held on June 30, 1940. The church building and the rectory were built by 1942 and the church was blessed by Archbishop John Murray in 1942. http://www.staugustine-holytrinity.org St. Augustine parish was established on June 11, 1896. Fr. Joseph T. Busch organized this new parish, served as its first pastor, and oversaw the building of the church. On August 30, 1896, Archbishop Ireland dedicated the original church, which stood on the southeast corner of Fourth Avenue and Grand Avenue, where the Greystone Apartment building now stands. After being remodeled, expanded, and reinforced with brick on March 31, 1923, the church burned to the ground. Doing their best to replicate structures of the old church wherever possible, builders were able to construct the current church structure for a Christmas Day 1924 opening. The parish still hosts The Argument of the Month.http://www.aotmclub.com/ Though originally separate, these two churches were merged into one in 2010, as part of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul-Minneapolis' strategic plan and reorganization of parishes. =St. John Vianney Catholic Church= Because of the population increase of South St. Paul following World War II, St. John Vianney Parish was established on July 5, 1946 as the third Catholic parish in South St. Paul, under the direction of Father Harold Whittet. Because no church or school had yet been built at the time of establishment, the parish rented the pavilion at Kaposia Park and held its first Mass there on July 28, 1946. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place on August 5, 1946 and the original makeshift church was constructed from two Army barracks. The church opened for its first Mass on the Easter Vigil, April 5, 1947. Shortly after, a roller- skating rink was built in the basement of the church to raise money. Almost eight years later in 1954, SJV school (originally named Providence School) opened with 109 students in grades one through four. The Sisters of St. Casimir, a Chicago-based Order, formed the school's first teaching staff. By 1958, the school contained grades one through eight. Construction was completed on the rectory and parish offices in 1960. The original makeshift church building of two army barracks was razed and the worship space was moved to the lower level of the school building (its current location). In 1974, a preschool and kindergarten program were added to the school. From that time until 1989, the school was staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The fall of 1992 saw the establishment of a full day kindergarten program as well as an extended day program. During the 1996-1997 school year, the St. John Vianney Little Learners Preschool became fully accredited with the kindergarten through sixth grade program. In May 2000, SJV expanded its facilities with the addition of the Parish Life and Community Center, which includes a gymnasium, kitchen and cafeteria, meeting rooms, and an extended gathering space. The addition was completed in March and dedicated on May 19, 2001. The current priest is Terry Beeson.

City government City government is simple: there are no city employees and no direct city services. Consultants provides the necessary professional services. Contractual arrangements with neighboring cities cover police and fire protection. Roads are maintained by independent contractors. All but a few properties have water wells and individual septic systems. Deer problem Sunfish Lake is said to have over 50 deer contained within its area. Deer are known to be a nuisance especially in causing traffic problems, but can also cause damage to private property by consuming natural and planted vegetation around homes. Bucks also use small trees and saplings to rub their antlers on in order to remove a velvet like material that covers them. This damages the bark and can eventually completely kill the tree. The City Council enacted a deer culling program in 2009 in an attempt to decrease the population. The hunting was limited to Musser Park but produced only 10 total deer kills. In 2010, the City Council expanded the range of the hunting to willing private owners' land. A team of bowhunters was invited to participate in the deer eradication. This is an opportunity to help the city and also train themselves as bowhunters.

A previous City of West St. Paul, incorporated in the late 19th century, was situated in what is now called St. Paul's Lower West Side. According to the West 7th/Fort Road foundation, St. Paul annexed the West Side, and was incorporated for two reasons: \\"to aid law enforcement‚Äîcriminals could escape St. Paul authorities by crossing to the West Side and Dakota County‚Äîand to eliminate the Wabasha Street Bridge tolls which were inhibiting development on the West Side.\\" The current West St. Paul split from the western half of South St. Paul, and was incorporated in 1889, just south of the city of St. Paul. The population was 19,540 at the 2010 census, growing by 135 since 2000. West Saint Paul is known for its 2.5-mile retail strip along Robert Street.

Approximately 15 miles west of Rochester, the population of Dodge Center was 2,670 at the 2010 census. Dodge Center is part of the Rochester, MN Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Dodge Center, 1800s Early 1900s - Dodge Center Dodge Center, Minnesota Palmerlee's Place - Dodge Center - 1911 Bridge over Zumbro River in Dodge Center - 1917 The Dodge Center area was first settled by pioneers in the 1850s. The town was created by the railroad system and named for its central location within Dodge County, Minnesota, which was named for Henry Dodge, twice the governor of Wisconsin. The first train to reach Dodge Center arrived on July 13, 1866. Shortly after, D.L. Tyler moved to Dodge Center from Ashland (which had no railroad) and built its first general store in 1867. Tyler also became the town's first postmaster. Dodge Center's site was officially platted in 1867 and recorded in July 1869. In January 1870, the legislature passed a bill changing the town's name to Silas. The bill was reconsidered the next day and no further action was taken. The town remained Dodge Center and was incorporated in February 1872 by special act of the legislature. Early Dodge Center was a farming community known for growing grain. Grain wagons lined up and down Main Street and into the surrounding countryside waiting their turn at either of two grain elevators. By 1870, Dodge Center's population had grown to 400‚Äì500. The two grain elevators, a gun shop, Tyler's general store and The Kinney House (a hotel widely known in the region and later burned) had become established businesses. The Chicago and North Western Railroad depot had also been completed. Also by 1870, the one-room schoolhouse, in which a Mrs. Rice taught, had become too small. Realizing the importance of education, the people of Dodge Center built a wooden, L-shaped, two-story schoolhouse, costing about $15,000. The first high school commencement exercises were held in 1885.[2] When that school was also outgrown, a new brick building was constructed in 1898. The 1870 school was cut in half and converted. One half became an opera house (where the Assembly of God church now stands) and the other half became apartments directly across the street. The opera house was one of the grandest in southeastern Minnesota, with a large stage, balcony and opera seats. The opera house eventually became a church and was destroyed by fire in 1948. The apartments were demolished in the 1980s. The 1898 building, at the corner of 1st Ave NW and 3rd Street NW, was used until 1972. A gymnasium, auditorium and two classrooms were added in 1936, part of President Franklin Roosevelt's WPA program. An addition containing a library and home- economics room was added in 1950 and an elementary school building was constructed in 1958. Of the 1890s portion of the building (demolished in 1972), one stairwell and a classroom still exist. The small 1898 portion and the 1936, 1950 and 1958 additions remain standing and are owned by a private entity (as of August 2007); they house apartments with several small businesses. A new high school was erected on the western edge of town in 1972 and is still in use. Dodge Center's first newspaper, the Dodge Center Press, began publication in 1874. The Dodge Center Star was established in 1890 by Edgar Stivers. The two papers merged in 1936 to become the Dodge Center Star- Record. Along with the Kinney House, the Windsor Hotel developed a fine reputation throughout the region. A third hotel, the Hartley House, was built just south of the Chicago Great Western station. It burned one night, killing a traveling female teacher. Dodge Center's first permanent doctor was Steven W. Ranson, who began practicing there in June 1870. He also opened a drug store in 1872. In 1875 Dr. James A. Garver, of Ohio, moved from Wasioja to Dodge Center, where he continued to live and practice the rest of his life. The Joseph Garrison post of the Grand Army of the Republic was established with 22 charter members in 1885. Garrison was the second man from Dodge County to lose his life in the American Civil War. He died in Libby Prison of wounds suffered in the Battle of Bull Run. A large three-story roller mill was built in 1887. It had a national reputation for the fine quality of its flour and won first prize at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The mill and its brand were later sold. It was later destroyed by fire. The Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad came to Dodge Center in 1885, the name being changed to Chicago Great Western in 1892. The track ran from Minneapolis, MN to Oelwein, IA. The last section of track to be completed was the long trestle across the Zumbro River, north of Dodge Center. Religion had an early start in Dodge Center. The Seventh Day Baptists organized in 1859 and the settlers erected a building in 1865. They moved it into the village of Dodge Center and dedicated it in 1873. Today, Dodge Center continues this seventh day tradition with the modern Dodge Center Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Sunday Baptists built a church in 1874 in the southern part of the village. A tornado demolished the building in 1880. The Methodist Church was constructed in 1878 and was used by the congregation until 1958 when it moved into the current building. The Congregational Church community began to move to Dodge Center from Wasioja, MN in 1875.

It was fought on four fronts: # In the south, Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at Mobile, Alabama, with allied Indians on both sides. The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, and destroying the network of Spanish missions in Florida. # In New England, English colonists fought against French colonists and Indian forces in Acadia and Canada. Quebec City was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the Acadian capital Port Royal was captured in 1710. The French colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart British expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine.William Williamson.

They executed raids in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (including Maine), most famously the Raid on Deerfield in 1704. # In Newfoundland, English colonists based at St. John's disputed control of the island with the French colonists of Plaisance. Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids on settlements. The French colonists successfully captured St. John's in 1709, but the British colonists quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it. # French privateers based in Acadia and Placentia captured many ships from New England's fishing and shipping industries. Privateers took 102 prizes into Placentia, second only to Martinique in France's American colonies. The naval conflict ended with the capture of Acadia (Nova Scotia).Donald F.

France ceded the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain while retaining Cape Breton Island and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some terms were ambiguous in the treaty, and the concerns of various Indian tribes were not included, thereby setting the stage for future conflicts. Background Philip of Anjou proclaimed as the King of Spain in November 1700. A dispute over his succession led to war between the Grand Alliance and the Bourbon alliance. When war broke out in Europe in 1701 following the death of King Charles II concerning who should succeed him to the Spanish throne, it was initially restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France.Thomas, pp. 405‚Äì407 Both the British and French wanted to keep their American colonies neutral, but they did not reach an agreement.Evarts Boutell Greene, Provincial America, 1690‚Äì1740 (1905) pp 140‚Äì41. But the American colonists had their own tensions which had been growing along the borders separating the French and English colonies, especially concerning boundaries and governing authority in the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies, which stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay.Stone, pp. 161, 165 The total population of the English colonies was about 250,000, with Virginia and New England dominating.Craven, p. 288 The residents were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the Appalachian Mountains.See Winsor, p. 341, showing a 1687 map of the southeastern colonies Colonists knew little of the interior of the continent to the west of the Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes. This area was dominated by Indian tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated it. Spanish missionaries in La Florida had established a network of missions to convert the Indians to Roman Catholicism.Weber, pp. 100‚Äì107 The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population to whom they ministered has been estimated at 20,000.Cooper and Terrill, p. 22 French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River, and they established a small colonial presence at Fort Maurepas near Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699.Weber, p. 158 From there, they began to build trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw, a large tribe whose enemies included the British-allied Chickasaw.Crane, p. 385 All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of infectious diseases such as smallpox by early explorers and traders.Waselkov and Hatley, p. 104 The arrival of French colonists in the south threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended Nine Years' War.Weber, pp. 158‚Äì159 Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic colonists of New Spain and the Protestant colonists along the coast.Arnade, p. 32 To the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes. Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at St. John's and a French colony at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe.Drake, p. 115 These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.Pope, pp. 202‚Äì203Drake, p. 115,203 The borders and boundaries remained uncertain between Acadia and New England despite battles along the border throughout King William's War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay near Castine, Maine, which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William's War.Drake, p. 36 The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indians, primarily Abenaki and Iroquois, and the Hudson River‚ÄìLake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.Drake, p. 150 The Hudson Bay territories (also known as Prince Rupert's Land) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709.Newman, pp. 87,109‚Äì124Bryce, p. 58 The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied for their return in the negotiations that ended this war.Newman, pp. 127‚Äì128 Technology and organization Military technology used in America was not as developed as in Europe. Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications at the start of the war, such as St. Augustine, Florida, Boston, Quebec City, and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, although Port Royal's fortifications were completed early in the war.Shurtleff, p. 492; MacVicar, p. 45; Arnade, p. 32; Prowse, pp. 211,223 Some villages and settlements were protected by wooden palisades, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with gun ports through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below.Leckie, p. 231 Europeans and colonists were typically armed with smooth-bore muskets that had a maximum range of about but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indian warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive tomahawks and bows. A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery which were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses.Peckham, p. 26 Port Royal, Acadia, 1702. Few settlements had stone fortification at the start of the war. English colonists were generally organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland.Prowse, p. 223 The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the troupes de la marine. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France numbering between 500 and 1,200. They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers.Peckham, p. 27 Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and not to provide them with weapons. Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indians before the war, but this was reduced to 200 after English colonist raids made early in the war.Wright, p. 65 Course of the war =Carolina and Florida= Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville sought to establish a relationship with natives in the Mississippi watershed as a result of the last war with England. Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade, and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other's activities. French Canadian explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville had developed a \\"Project sur la Caroline\\" in the aftermath of the previous war which called for establishing relationships with Indians in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English colonists off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas. In pursuit of this grand strategy, he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by La Salle in 1670) and established Fort Maurepas in 1699. From this base and Fort Louis de la Mobile (founded in 1702),Peckham, p. 58 he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez, and other tribes.Waselkov and Hatley, pp. 105‚Äì137 English colonial traders and explorers from Carolina had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi.Crane, p. 382 Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.Crane, p. 380 Iberville had approached the Spanish in January 1702 before the war broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola, Florida in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense at the head of the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force with some 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.Oatis, pp. 49‚Äì50 Carolina's Governor Moore received notification concerning the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida.Arnade, p. 33 500 English colonial soldiers and militia and 300 Indians captured and burned the town of St. Augustine, Florida in the Siege of St. Augustine (1702).Winsor, p. 318 The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana.Winsor, p. 319 The Apalachee and Timucua of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the Apalachee Massacre of 1704.Arnade, pp. 35‚Äì36 Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the Savannah River where they were confined to reservations. Raids continued in the following years consisting of large Indian forces, sometimes including a small number of white men;Arnade, p. 36 this included major expeditions directed at Pensacola in 1707 and Mobile in 1709.Crane, p. 390Higginbotham, pp. 308‚Äì312,383‚Äì385 The Muscogee (Creek), Yamasee, and Chickasaw were armed and led by English colonists, and they dominated these conflicts at the expense of the Choctaw, Timucua, and Apalachee.Covington, p. 340 =Acadia and New England= New French raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts in February, 1704 Throughout the war, New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy thwarted New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. In 1703, Michel Leneuf de la Valli√®re de Beaubassin commanded a few French Canadians and 500 Indians of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and they led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth (Portland, Maine) in the Northeast Coast Campaign.Peckham, p. 62 They killed or captured more than 300 settlers. In February 1704, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga Indians and 50 French Canadians in a raid on Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and destroyed the settlement, killing and capturing many colonists. More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where most of the children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man.Peckham, p. 64 There was an active slave trade of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity. New England colonists were unable to effectively combat these raids, so they retaliated by launching an expedition against Acadia led by the famous American Indian fighter Benjamin Church. The expedition raided Grand Pr√©, Chignecto, and other settlements. French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia's capital of Port Royal, but Church's account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack.Drake, p. 202 raided the settlement of Grand-Pr√©, defended by the Acadian and Mi'kmaq militia. Father S√©bastien Rale was widely suspected of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. In the winter of 1705, Massachusetts dispatched 275 militiamen under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church. French and Wabanaki Confederacy continued making raids in northern Massachusetts in 1705, against which the New England colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while leaders from New France and New England negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success.Peckham, p. 65 Raids by Indians persisted until the end of the war, sometimes with French participation.See e.g. Drake, pp. 286‚Äì287 In May 1707, Governor Dudley organized an expedition to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed.Peckham, p. 67 In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead.Drake, pp. 238‚Äì247 In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported that two-thirds of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.Eccles, p. 139 captured the settlement. The fall of Port Royal ended French control over the eastern peninsula of Acadia. In October 1710, 3,600 British and colonial forces led by Francis Nicholson finally captured Port Royal after a siege of one week. This ended official French control of the peninsular portion of Acadia (present-day mainland Nova Scotia),Peckham, p. 71 although resistance continued until the end of the war.Parkman (1892), p. 184 Resistance by the Wabanaki Confederation continued in the 1711 Battle of Bloody Creek and raids along the Maine frontier. The remainder of Acadia (present-day eastern Maine and New Brunswick) remained disputed territory between New England and New France. =New France= The French in New France's heartland of Canada opposed attacking the Province of New York. They were reluctant to arouse the Iroquois, whom they feared more than they did the British colonists and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France because it would interrupt the lucrative Indian fur trade, much of which came through New France.Parkman (1892), pp. 8‚Äì14 The Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict, despite Peter Schuyler's efforts to interest them in the war.Parkman (1892), p. 14 (Schuyler was Albany's commissioner of Indians.) Hendrick Tejonihokarawa, a Mohawk chief, was successful in gaining support from Anne, Queen of Great Britain, to launch an expedition to take Quebec City. Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical support from the queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec.Peckham, p. 69 (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710.Peckham, p. 70 With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711. The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its execution was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships of the line and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town's population and greatly straining the colony's ability to provide necessary provisions.Rodger, p. 129 The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog. More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition.Peckham, p. 72 In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker's disaster, and he also turned back.Drake, p. 281 In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict.Eccles, p. 136 =Newfoundland= In 1705, Daniel d'Auger de Subercase, the Governor of Plaisance, led a French and Mi'kmaq expedition against English settlements in Newfoundland. Newfoundland's coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe.Prowse, pp. 277‚Äì280 Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John's on Conception Bay.Prowse, pp. 223, 276 During King William's War, d'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696‚Äì97,Prowse, p. 229 and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance.Prowse, p. 235 During the winter of 1705, Plaisance's French governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John's. The French and their Indian allies continued to harass the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at ¬£188,000.Prowse, pp. 242‚Äì246 The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island's northern coasts.Prowse, pp. 246‚Äì248 In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi'kmaq volunteers captured St. John's and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709. (The same French expedition also tried to take Ferryland, but it successfully resisted.)Prowse, p. 249 English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 but did not make them, the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.Prowse, pp. 235‚Äì236 Peace Map of European colonies in North America. Areas in purple were territories France ceded to England in the Treaty of Utrecht, the peace treaty that concluded the war. In 1712, Britain and France declared an armistice, and a final peace agreement was signed the following year. Under terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed Nova Scotia), sovereignty over Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois and agreed that commerce with American Indians farther inland would be open to all nations.Marshall, p. 1155 It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including Cape Breton Island, and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland.Prowse, p. 258 By the later years of the war, many Abenakis had tired of the conflict despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders.Morrison, pp. 161‚Äì162 Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River and the establishment of government-run trading posts in their territory.Morrison, pp. 162‚Äì163 The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory.Calloway, pp. 107‚Äì110 Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726.Reid, pp. 97‚Äì98 Consequences =Acadia and Newfoundland= Shortly after the war, the French established the Fortress of Louisbourg. The fortified settlement was located to the north of the ceded Acadian territory, on Cape Breton Island. The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island. French were resettled there from Newfoundland, creating the colony of √éle-Royale, and France constructed the Fortress of Louisbourg in the following years.Peckham, p. 74 This presence plus the rights to use the Newfoundland shore resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests, which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century.Prowse, p. 282 The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland, with the fishing fleets significantly reduced.Prowse, p. 251 The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized,Prowse, p. 274 and they attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters, as they previously had. However, many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English straw owners to evade British controls.Prowse, p. 277 The British capture of Acadia had long-term consequences for the Acadians and Mi'kmaq living there. Britain's hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous, a situation on which French and Mi'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized.Plank, pp. 57‚Äì61 British relations with the Mi'kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion in Nova Scotia and also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties. Neither the Abenakis nor the Mi'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht, and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories, so the Mi'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands. This conflict was increased by French intriguers such as S√©bastien Rale, and eventually they developed into Father Rale's War (1722‚Äì1727).Plank, pp. 71‚Äì79 The Battle of Norridgewock during Dummer's War, August 1724. After portions of Acadia were ceded, the British faced resistance from Abenaki and Mi'kmaq tribes. British relations were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to √éle-Royale and √éle-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French leaders such as Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia. Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders. The boundaries were unclear as laid out by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula was included in the treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick.Peckham, p. 84 The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George's War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years' War.See e.g. Parkman (1897) for the later history of British-Acadian conflict. =New England= Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war, yet the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown's military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition.Craven, pp. 307‚Äì309 =Southern colonies= Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war,Weber, pp. 144‚Äì145 and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years' War.Weber, p. 199 Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability.Weber, p. 166 The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina.Weber, p. 180 James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.Peckham, p. 75 The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests.Craven, pp. 301‚Äì302 South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations. =Trade= The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico,Weber, p. 184 renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish.Peckham, p. 82 Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out.Parkman (1897), pp. 133‚Äì150 Notes Sources      Greene, Evarts Boutell.

His body of work encompasses poetry, children's books, television scripts, novels, short fiction, computer texts, and sound poetry. His love of language and writing, evident in his many accomplishments, continues to be carried forward by many. Work Nichol was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. Though his early writing consisted of fiction and lyrical poems, he first received international recognition in the 1960s for concrete poetry. The first major publications included Journeying & the returns (1967), a purple box containing visual & lyrical poems and Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer (1969) a book of concrete poetry. He won the 1970 Governor General's Award for poetry with not one but four publications: the prose booklet The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid a collection of lyrical poems, Beach Head, the boxed concrete sequence, Still Water and The Cosmic Chef, a boxed anthology of concrete and visual poetry. His best known work, The Martyrology (1972-1992) is an open-ended, lifelong poem that investigates language. The 'saints' are drawn from 'st' words (storm becomes St. Orm) and their spiritual quest provides a springboard from which linguistic issues of textuality, reading and writing are explored. One of Nichol's strengths was his ability to collaborate with other artists. The work of the sound poetry group, The Four Horsemen (Nichol, Rafael Barreto-Rivera, Paul Dutton and Steve McCaffery) has been documented in Volcano Theatre's stage performances of The Four Horsemen Project (Dora Mavor Moore Award 2007 & 2015). He collaborated with Steve McCaffrey to form The Toronto Research Group (TRG), with Barbara Caruso, visual artist, with R. Murray Schafer, Howard Gerhard and John Beckwith, composers. Nichol's zest for publishing other writers was reflected in founding Ganglia Press with David Aylward in 1964 and grOnk in 1967 with bill bissett and David UU ( David W. Harris). He was a volunteer editor at Coach House Books from 1975 to his death. In 1977, he was one of the collective that established Underwhich Editions which edited, designed, published and distributed the works of worthy writers. During the 1970s and 80s, bp was a contributing editor of Open Letter, a literary magazine. Nichol also had a large presence on screens of various sizes. In the mid-1980s, he became a writer for the children's television show, Fraggle Rock, created by Jim Henson. Soon, scriptwriting for other children's television shows followed: The Raccoons, Under the Umbrella Tree, Care Bears and Babar. Several films include bp and his work, starting with Michael Ondaatje's short film, Sons of Captain Poetry; Ron Mann's Poetry in Motion followed by full-length features bp: pushing the boundaries, directed by Elizabeth Yake and Brian Nash and more recently, Justin Stephenson's award- winning film, The Complete Works. He died in Toronto, Ontario, five days shy of his 44th birthday. Since his death, there has been an upsurge of interest in First Screenings, Nichol's 1984 computer poem (updated by Jim Andrews and his team ) which has been part of electronic exhibitions from Mexico to Oakville. Commemoration A / LAKE / A / LANE / A / LINE / A / LONE - bpNichol The bpNichol Chapbook Award, a prize for poetry publications between 10-48 pages, was established in 1986 by Phoenix Community Works Foundation. This annual award for excellence in Canadian Poetry in English is now administered by Meet the Presses collective.

History In the year 1853, Peter Peterson Haslerud purchased and platted the village site of Peterson and was the major force behind its early growth and development. The community was named after him. After buying the land and platting the town, he was elected to the Minnesota State Legislature, served in several appointed positions and in 1856 was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota as Immigration officer for the 14th District of Minnesota. Peter was instrumental in bringing the railroad through Rushford Township in 1867 and he gave the railroad company fifteen acres of land and along with other citizens contributed $800. to secure a station and warehouse at Peterson. Peter began buying wheat from local farmers and shipping it back to the eastern part of the U.S. In 1870, a post office was established in Peterson and Even A. Hjelie was appointed first postmaster. In 1871, Peter Peterson Haslerud developed a \\"trout farm\\" on his property outside Peterson and continued to expand the boundaries of the town. In 1873, Ole Ensberg started a blacksmith shop and in 1874 an additional quarter section of land was laid out into lots and added to the village of Peterson. In 1875, two general stores, a hardware store, and a drug store were established. In 1875, the telegraph was installed at the railroad station and G.P. Haslerud (Peter Peterson Haslerud's oldest son) was appointed agent. Also in that year fifteen additional acres were platted and Prospect Park, Mill, Centennial, Fillmore, Church, and Myrtle Streets were named. In 1876, a mill was built with farmers living in the surrounding areas subscribing most of the stock. A livery barn, a steam mill, the Peterson Hotel, the Northwestern Bar and other small businesses opened for business. In 1882, the Minnesota and Dakota Gazetteer, gave a contemporary description of Peterson: \\"An unincorporated village of 100 inhabitants in Rushford Township, northeastern part of Fillmore County, and a station on the Southern Minnesota Railroad, 25 miles from Preston and 120 miles from Minneapolis. It is situated on the Root Rover which furnishes power to a flour mill at this point. A steam flour mill is also in operation in the village and there is a Lutheran church and district school. The exports are flour and wheat. Modes of communication are: Western Union Telegraph, American Express, two stages semi-weekly from Pilot Mound to Peterson via Arendahl and daily mail service.\\" Peterson was organized as a village in 1909.

The early settlers gave Rushford its name on Christmas Day in 1854, during a chicken supper hosted by Capt. Dyer. The name stems from the nearby Rush Creek, which had tall Rushes growing along its banks. The area was once referred to as ‚ÄúTrail City‚Äù because seven Indian trails met at the creek.

It is the county seat. Its population was 18,016 at the 2010 census. The city is at the junction of Interstates 35 and 90, about south of the Twin Cities. It is on the shores of Fountain Lake, Pickerel Lake, Albert Lea Lake, Goose Lake, School Lake, and Lake Chapeau. Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake are part of the Shell Rock River flowage. The city's early growth was based on agriculture, farming support services and manufacturing, and it was a significant rail center. At one time it was the site of Cargill's headquarters. Other manufacturing included Edwards Manufacturing (barn equipment), Scotsman Ice Machines, Streater Store fixtures, and Universal Milking Machines. As in many U.S. cities, Albert Lea's manufacturing base has substantially diminished. A major employer was the Wilson & Company meatpacking plant, later known as Farmstead and Farmland. This facility was destroyed by fire in July 2001. History Albert Miller Lea The city is named after Albert Miller Lea, a topographer with the United States Dragoons, who surveyed southern Minnesota and northern Iowa in 1835, including the current site of Albert Lea. Captain Nathan Boone, a son of Daniel Boone, was the scout for Lea's unit. Albert Lea became the county seat after a horse race against Glenville, MN. The city received national attention in 1959 after Local 6 of the United Packinghouse Workers of America went on strike against Wilson & Co. (one of the Big Four meatpacking plants at the time) over issues involving mandatory overtime requirements.Register, Cheri (2001) Packinghouse Daughter, HarperCollins. When Wilson & Co. attempted to operate the plant with replacement workers, violence erupted and split the town. During the 109-day strike, Governor Orville Freeman acted to quell the violence by closing the plant, calling in the Minnesota National Guard, and (on December 11) declaring martial law.\\"Martial Law Ordered in Meat Strike\\", Oakland Tribune, December 11, 1959, p1 A federal district court in Minneapolis ruled against Freeman on December 23, and the plant turned back to Wilson & Co. just days later.Frost, Richard T.

Its climate type is typical for inland northern United States locations, but due to its southern position in the state, its summers and winters have higher temperatures than other, more northerly regions of the state. An exception to this rule is the urban core of Minneapolis - St. Paul, which sees higher temperatures typical of an urban heat island, but Albert Lea is significantly warmer than locations such as Duluth.

Its name is derived from the Dutch for eel (aal) and lake (meer). Aalsmeer is bordered by the Westeinderplassen lake, the largest open water of the Randstad, and the Ringvaart Canal. The town is located 13 km (8 mi) southwest of Amsterdam. The town is sometimes referred to as the flower capital of the world, as the largest flower auction in the world is based in Aalsmeer, along with numerous nurseries and an experimental station for floriculture. Population centres The municipality of Aalsmeer consists of the following cities, towns, and villages: Aalsmeer, Kudelstaart, Oosteinde, as well as the hamlet Calslagen. Geology Aalsmeer is located on the border of the former Haarlem Lake. The older portion of town is built on peat, and is surrounded by polders. The polders consist of loamy soil and are below sea level. History Aalsmeer in 1866. Aalsmeer is first referenced in a document from 1133 in which it is called \\"Alsmar\\" and is granted to the Abbey of Rijnsburg. Diederik VII van Kleef confirmed this grant in an act in 1199. The area was then a wilderness with alders and willow forests. In its surroundings, large tracts of land were dug up for peat, creating large lakes and ponds such as Oosteinderpoel (East End Pool), Schinkelpoel (Schinkel Pool), Stommeer (Stom Lake), Hornmeer (Horn Lake), Legmeer (Leg Lake), and the Westeinderplassen (West End Ponds). This left little land for agriculture, causing Aalsmeer's inhabitants to switch to fishery. The land was cultivated intensely, mostly for tree nurseries. Topographic map of Aalsmeer, June 2015 The lack of dry land was countered by reclaiming some of the lakes, starting with Stom Lake in 1650, and followed by Horn Lake in 1674. In 1852, the large Haarlem Lake, bordering on Aalsmeer, was made into a polder. Then followed Schinkelpoel, Oosteinderpoel, and Legmeer. Peat was no longer dug up and the fishing business declined. Yet horticulture increased, especially strawberry cultivation, which peaked between 1850 and 1885. The strawberry became the symbol for the flag of Aalsmeer: red (fruit), green (leaf), and black (soil). The cultivation of flowers began circa 1880, first with roses in greenhouses. The growers would sell their strawberries and flowers to distributors who would bring them with barges to the market in Amsterdam. But the trade shifted to Aalsmeer where auctions began to be held in local caf√©s. In 1912 two auction businesses were established: Centrale Aalsmeerse Veiling (Central Aalsmeer Auction) in the town's centre and Bloemenlust in Aalsmeer East. =World War II= During World War 2, Aalsmeer gained a reputation for its Nazi support, mostly because of its fanatical National Socialistic mayor and a handful of fascist supporters. The highest supreme commander of the German Wehrmacht in the Netherlands, Friedrich Christiansen, was a regular visitor. Following the war, more than a hundred court cases were held against Nazi supporters from Aalsmeer. =Post war= In 1950 Aalsmeer had 12,500 inhabitants. In 1968 the two auction businesses merged and formed the Verenigde Bloemenveilingen Aalsmeer (United Flower Auctions Aalsmeer). In 1972 a new large auction building was completed in South Aalsmeer and expanded in 1999. Local government Aalsmeer Town Hall The municipal council of Aalsmeer consists of 23 seats, which since 2018 are divided as follows: * Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) ‚Äì 8 seats * People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) ‚Äì 6 seats * Absoluut Aalsmeer (AA) ‚Äì 4 seats * Democrats 66 (D66) ‚Äì 2 seats * GreenLeft (GL) ‚Äì 2 seats * Labour Party (PvdA) ‚Äì 1 seat The executive board consists of CDA, VVD and D66.

The flowers that are grown and sold here are carnations, roses, lilacs, freesias, chrysanthemums, cyclamens, and begonias. The Endemol television studios are located in the former Central Auction building. The Bloemenlust building is nowadays a sports, event, and congress centre.

The Beemster is the first so-called polder in the Netherlands that was reclaimed from a lake, the water being extracted from the lake by windmills. The Beemster Polder was dried during the period 1609 through 1612. It has preserved intact its well-ordered landscape of fields, roads, canals, dykes and settlements, laid out in accordance with classical and Renaissance planning principles. A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The grids are offset: the larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometer from the larger roads.  Population centres  The municipality of Beemster consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: =Topography= 475px Topographic map of the municipality of Beemster, June 2015.  History  Around 800 AD the area of the modern municipality of Beemster was covered in peat. The name \\"Beemster\\" has been derived from \\"Bamestra\\" (see Groenedijk, 2000), the name of a small river in the area. In the period 1150-1250 peat-digging by people, and storm floods, enlarged that small river into an inland sea, a lake in open connection with the Zuiderzee. Around 1605 private investors started to drain the Beemster lake. In 1610, this was almost complete, but the lake re-filled because of a break in the Zuiderzee dikes. It was decided to make the ring-dike a meter high above the surrounding country. In 1612 the polder was dry and the country was divided among the investors. In the earlier days of the polder, farmers occupied its lands for growing the crops necessary for long sea journeys by the VOC to the East Indies. It turned out that the farmland was so good that the project was considered then to be an economic success, in contrast to e.g. the Heerhugowaard. Since 1999 the entire Beemster polder has been on the UNESCO world heritage list. The Beemster polder is home to CONO Kaasmakers, maker of the Beemster brand of cheeses. This co-op was formed in 1901 to create cheese made from milk that comes from the Beemster polder. Today Beemster Cheesewww.beemstercheese.us is sold in Europe, as well as the U.S., Canada, Japan, and China. World Heritage Site Because of its historical relevance, and because the original structure of the area is still largely intact, the Beemster was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1999. Justification for Inscription is as follows: *Criterion (i): The Beemster Polder is a masterpiece of creative planning, in which the ideals of antiquity and the Renaissance were applied to the design of a reclaimed landscape. *Criterion (ii): The innovative and intellectually imaginative landscape of the Beemster Polder had a profound and lasting impact on reclamation projects in Europe and beyond. *Criterion (iv): The creation of the Beemster Polder marks a major step forward in the interrelationship between humankind and water at a crucial period of social and economic expansion. In addition in the Beemster Polder there are five fortresses as part of the Stelling van Amsterdam, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Beemster Polder combines two UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The town is located about northwest of Amsterdam in the Randstad metropolitan area, north of the North Sea Canal very close to the North Sea coast. A railway tunnel and two motorway tunnels cross the canal between Beverwijk and the nearby city of Haarlem on the south bank. Around 1640, a town called Beverwyck was founded in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. That town's modern name is Albany, New York.  Population centres  The municipality of Beverwijk consists of two cores, Beverwijk proper and Wijk aan Zee, to the west, right on the coast. History Engraving from 1601 by Jan Saenredam of a beached whale on the coast near Beverwijk The name Beverwijk comes from Bedevaartswijk, meaning \\"pilgrimage neighbourhood\\". The town formed at the Saint Agatha Church which was a pilgrimage location in the Middle Ages. Allegedly Agatha of Sicily appeared there in the 9th century to a virgin from Velsen who was fleeing from the Count of Kennemerland. In 1276 Beverwijk was granted market rights by Floris V, and in 1298 it was granted city rights by John I, both Counts of Holland. During the 17th century wealthy merchants from Amsterdam built their estates, such as Huize Akerendam, Huize Westerhout, and Huize Scheijbeeck, in the scenic dunes surrounding Beverwijk. Prior to the reclamation of the IJ Bay, the narrowest point in the North Holland peninsula was at Beverwijk. Therefore, a defensive line was built there in 1800 following the Battle of Castricum in 1799. In 1944, during the Second World War, the Germans conducted a house-to-house raid in Beverwijk and Velsen-Noord, seizing nearly 500 persons as hostages to force the murderers of three collaborators to surrender themselves. In all, 63 of them never returned. Around 1977, the first furniture stores opened along the Parallel Road, forming the first \\"furniture boulevard\\" in the Netherlands. By 1981, 10 businesses had been established there. South of the furniture boulevard, the Bazaar was introduced in 1980. On March 23, 1997, Beverwijk was the location of a clash of two football firms. Supporters of the Dutch football team AFC Ajax met with Feyenoord supporters in what has come to be known as the \\"Battle of Beverwijk\\". During this incident, one Ajax supporter was beaten to death. Since 1997, Special Needs Judo Foundation has organised its annual OBG (Open Beverwijk G-judo) tournament in Sporthal De Walvis, featuring over 1000 special needs judoka from all over the world. The tournament takes place every year in April.

In this time, Bussum was a large heathland with many small farms, sheep pens and forests as is shown on old maps. Since Bussum is situated near the fortified town Naarden it was governed by Naarden from 1369 onward. In 1470 Bussum was inhabited by about 250 people, which made it the smallest village in Het Gooi. Bussum became independent from Naarden in 1817, yet it was not until the arrival of a railway line in 1874 that Bussum began to flourish. Two train stations were built in the town, that still exist today: Naarden-Bussum and Bussum Zuid (Dutch for Bussum South), both on the connection between Amsterdam and Hilversum. The stations and the road network fostered the town's status as a satellite town of Amsterdam, allowing for reverse commute also to Hilversum.

The (non- elected) mayor of Heemskerk is currently Mieke Baltus (CDA). History It is not certain where the name of Heemskerk comes from. The town was already known during the Middle Ages. In an official deed from the year of 1063, the town was known as Hemezen Kyrica, Latinized Frisian meaning Church of Hemezen, a Frisian nun who lived in a religious house there. Heemskerk knows many historical monuments, among them the Huldtoneel (lit. the \\"Inaugurate Stage\\"), an artificial hill located near the current Rijksstraatweg, where once the Counts of Holland were inaugurated. According to tradition, the Huldtoneel was used before the Roman Era as a Germanic sanctuary. In the nineteenth century Jonkheer Gevers finally made the Huldtoneel a monument - as it is known today - and ordered passers-by to honour the monument. Many battles have been fought in Heemskerk. Two castles - Castle Oud Haerlem and Castle Heemskerk - were built in the twelfth and thirteenth century respectively to protect the County of Holland against the West Frisians. In the fifteenth century the residents of Heemskerk fought each other during the Hook and Cod wars, in which both castles were destroyed. The Oud Haerlem castle was never rebuilt, Castle Heemskerk however was. In 1492 a rebellion by the people of Kennemerland was brutally beaten down by the Austrian conquerors, on the place where today the cemetery of the Hervormde Kerk (Reformed Church) is located. Dutch Topographic map of Heemskerk, June 2015 Castle Heemskerk circa 1630. In 1610 the Castle Heemskerk was renamed to Castle Marquette and was at first the residence for many nobles and later inhabited by patricians. The last noble family that lived there were the House of Gevers. Today Castle Marquette is owned by the Spanish hotelgroup NH Hoteles and is the site of many weddings, conferences, and company courses, while the estate grounds are favoured for wedding photos. Located on the eastside of Heemskerk is Castle Assumburg, built from the remains of Kasteel Oud Haerlem in 1546. The Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) at the Nielenplein and Kerkplein is built in 1628, but it has a tower from the Middle Ages. In the graveyard around the church is a copy of a monument dedicated to the father of painter Maarten van Heemskerck. The original is located inside the church. =Agricultural village= The old village around 1915-30.J. Van Venetien (1968). Hart van Kennemerland: Album van het leven en werken in Midden-Kennemerland door de eeuwen heen. p.212. After the time of knights and nobles, Heemskerk remained a small, quiet village near the dunes. Its residents, who mainly worked in agriculture and keeping cattle, had good, but also some very bad times. From the time that products - mainly strawberries for the neighbouring town Beverwijk, where the fruits were sold - were brought to the market with donkeys, people from Heemskerk got the name of Donkey as a nickname and symbol. The former town hall was built in 1911 after a design by Jan Stuyt and was raised with an additional floor in 1949. Today this is the building where Janssen's notary office is located. The Roman Catholic Laurentiuskerk, designed by architect J.H. Tonnaer, was completed in 1891 and is a rare example of a Catholic church in Holland in a neo-renaissance style. There is nothing left of other historical monuments, like Castle Oud Haerlem.

History  Heemstede formed around the Castle Heemstede that was built overlooking the Spaarne River around 1286. Before 1296, Floris V, Count of Holland, granted Heemstede as a fiefdom to Reinier of Holy. During the 14th century, a village formed near the castle, which was destroyed and rebuilt several times in this period. A resident of this castle was Adriaan Pauw, who bought it in 1620. In 1653, Bennebroek split off from Heemstede, becoming a separate fiefdom. Growth was slow, and in 1787 Heemstede counted 196 families. Even at that early date Heemstede had already gained the reputation it has today, of being primarily a \\"bedroom community\\" for the cities of Haarlem and Amsterdam. Wealthy city families left the cities in the summer, escaping \\"canal fever\\" which caused illness from the putrid canals. As a result, many estates were built in the 17th and 18th centuries, some of which (partially) remain until today such as Oud-Berkenroede, Berkenrode, Ipenrode, Huis te Manpad, Hartekamp, Bosbeek, Meer en Bosch, Meer en Berg, and Gliphoeve. In 1857, the municipality Berkenrode was merged with Heemstede. In 1927, the northern portion of Heemstede, including a large part of the Haarlem Forest, was in turn added to the city of Haarlem.  Monuments and parks  *Groenendaal park: Designed by John Hope, it was formed by merging several country estates into one. *Vrijheidsbeeld (Freedom Statue), statue by Mari Andriessen to celebrate freedom and commemorate Heemstede victims of the Dutch Revolt. Located on the Vrijheidsdreef in Groenendaal park. *Slot Heemstede: The site of the Heemstede castle. *Hartekamp: Heemstede summer home of George Clifford, who hired Linnaeus to write his 'Hortus Cliffortianus', a detailed catalogue of the plant specimens in the herbarium and gardens of Hartecamp. George Clifford's house is closed to the public, but the surrounding gardens are used as a campus and are open to visitors. *Linnaeusbos (Linnaeus Forest): Originally a part of Hartekamp that was planted by George Clifford and documented by Linnaeus. In 2007, Heemstede celebrated Linnaeus's 300th birthday. *De Naald: The 'needle' is a monument placed by D.J. van Lennep to honor Witte van Haemstede, the savior of Haarlem at a battle which on April 26, 1304 and to honor the wounded of another battle fought against the Spanish on July 8, 1573. Both battles supposedly took place right at the corner of David Jacob van Lennep's house Huis te Manpad, where the monument stands.

In the late Middle Ages, after a miracle, a Marian shrine came into being for Our Lady to Need (Onze Lieve Vrouwe ter Nood). The chapel was destroyed during the Reformation, however the pilgrimage started to flourish again when in the seventeenth century a source with miraculous water started to sprout. The Marian sanctuary, situated outside the village in a so-called procession park, is one of the major pilgrimage destinations in the Netherlands, attracting pilgrims mainly from the diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam.

The name \\"Huizen\\" is Dutch for \\"houses\\" and this usage has been linked to the belief that the first stone houses, instead of the more common sod houses at the time, in the region appeared here. Huizen is part of the metropolitan area of Amsterdam. History Huizen was originally an agricultural village, about 2 kilometres from the sea. During wintertime the farmers went fishing, which started the development from an agricultural village to a coastal village with a thriving fishing industry, which was stimulated by building the harbour around 1850. After the damming of the Zuider Zee by the Afsluitdijk in 1932, the old sea was degraded to a mere freshwater lake, and economical activities shifted towards industry and commerce. In the 1960s the town was designated to build substantially large residential areas, to overcome the housing shortage in the region. From then on, the village took on an influx of people and grew rapidly. Where the Phohi- flat now stands in Huizen was, before World War II, the site of a large transmitter intended for contacting the Dutch East Indies, some 12.000 km away. A post mill that stood in Huizen was dismantled in 1916. It was re- erected in 1919 at the Netherlands Open Air Museum, Arnhem, Gelderland. Topography Huizen is part of the area 'Het Gooi'.

It lies immediately south of the polder and former municipality of Wieringermeer.  History  Medemblik was a prosperous trading town, when in 1282, Floris V, Count of Holland, successfully invaded West Friesland. He built several fortresses to control the region, one of which was Kasteel Radboud in Medemblik, and awarded Medemblik city rights in 1289. After Floris V was murdered in 1296, the local Frisian besieged the castle, but in 1297 an army from Holland thwarted their efforts to starve out the inhabitants, which included Medemblik citizens.Ben Dijkhuis The Castle at Medemblik Several more attacks took place in the following centuries. The most notorious of these happened in June 1517, when Medemblik was attacked from mainland Frisia by about 4000 pirates known as the Arumer Zwarte Hoop, led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama. Many citizens fled to the castle, which the pirates unsuccessfully besieged. Eventually, they took out their fury on the town, which burned to the ground. After this the band continued their marauding path on land throughout present day North Holland.Ben Dijkhuis Grote Pier en de Zwarte Hoop in 1517 (in Dutch) After Medemblik town walls were constructed in 1572, the castle lost its role as a refuge for the citizens, which led to its partially dismantling in 1578. Over the centuries the castle fell into decay, but in 1889 it became property of the crown and was restored to be used as a courthouse, which function it served until 1934. Anticipating the German invasion, the Rijksmuseum in September 1939 chose the castle as the initial hiding place of Rembrandt's Night Watch. On January 1, 2007, Medemblik merged with the municipalities of Noorder-Koggenland and Wognum, yet retained its own name in the surviving municipality, even though it was the smallest of the three in population. Again on January 1, 2011, Medemblik merged with Andijk and Wervershoof into the municipality Medemblik. The new city hall is the former office building of the DSB Bank in Wognum.

Muiden () is a city and former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It lies at the mouth of the Vecht and is in an area called the Vechtstreek. Since 2016, Muiden has been part of the new municipality of Gooise Meren. History The first known reference to Muiden is from 953 when Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, granted the settlement and its toll rights to Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht. It was called Amuda, meaning \\"mouth of the (river) A\\". \\"A\\" was the old name for the Vecht river. In 1122 Muiden was, together with Utrecht, granted some city rights by Emperor Henry V. After the lands around Muiden were given to Count Floris V, he began building Muider Castle at the mouth of the Vecht river. Muiden once again received city rights in 1296. The first defensive works date from the first half of the 15th century. In 1590 the walls are replaced with earthen mounds with bastions after a design by Adriaen Anthonisz. Muiden was the northern end of the Dutch Water Line. In 1673 the sea lock in the Vecht river was relocated from Fort Hinderdam to Muiden and in 1676 it was expanded with a sea wall along the Vecht mouth to prevent flooding. Developments in warfare during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 prompted another round of upgrades and the construction of forts part of the Stelling van Amsterdam, which includes the Muizenfort, the barracks on the Vestingplein, and the casemates in the ravelins. The layout of the fortification wall was revised. Fort Pampus Island, part of the former municipality of Muiden, was built from 1887 to 1897. Together with the lighthouse island near Durgerdam and the artillery battery at the Diemer seawall, it was meant to protect the entrance of the IJ Bay and the harbour of Amsterdam.

Various regional walking and cycling routes pass Muiden. Gunpowder factory In 1702 the hazardous production of gunpowder was removed from the city of Amsterdam. The vroedschap of Muiden granted a permit to Reinier van Cuyk of Amsterdam to build a gunpowder mill just west of Muiden that same year. The factory flourished during the First World War, was liquidated in 1919, and was restarted in 1922. During the 20th century its production steadily increased and the town grew towards the factory. In 1972 it was renamed \\"Muiden Chemie\\". In the 1980s, it was accused of illegal shipments to Iran. In 1990 Muiden Chemie went bankrupt and was taken over by the British company Royal Ordnance, part of British Aerospace. After a fire in 2001 and ongoing concerns over safety, it was decided to close the factory permanently. Explosions since 1883: * January 9, 1883: explosion on the factory premises, resulting in 13 deaths and much damage to the factory and Muiden. * 1886: explosion, 2 deaths.

Naarden hosts the bi-annual Naarden Photo Festival and, on Good Friday, a performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in the local church, which is called the Great Church or St. Vitus Church. The Great Church The Great Church (Grote Kerk) is situated on the Markstraat and dates from the 15th century. Prior to the Protestant Reformation it was named for St. Vitus. It is one of the oldest surviving churches in The Netherlands, having had the good fortune to survive the Spanish invasion of 1572 and the subsequent burning of the town. The church has numerous wooden vaults that are painted with scenes from the Old and New Testaments. These were hidden for many years and were only rediscovered in a recent restoration. The church is the venue for a number of cultural activities such as organ music nights and the bi-annual Naarden Photo festival. The Spanish House, with design commemorating the massacre of 1572 The Spanish House (Spaanse Huis), situated at Turfpoortstraat 27, was originally a church building converted to house migrants. In 1572 Spanish troops conducted a massacre of some 700 inhabitants who had gathered to hear a peace proposal. The Spanish then fired on the assembled citizens, and went on to set fire to the town. A plaque above the lintel of the door and below the eaves commemorates the massacre. In 1615, after the population had reestablished itself, they built the city hall on the site. Part of the building was given over to De Waag (The Scales House), the municipal office entrusted with the verification of weights and measures. The building later served a French garrison as a bakery, turning out over 1000 loaves per day. From 1967 until 1992 it served as the Comenius museum. Today, the historic building serves as the Weegschaal Museum. Naarden is also the place where John Amos Comenius is buried in a mausoleum on Klooster straat. This place receives many visitors from Czechia, where he was born. Comenius is known as the inventor of our school system with grades and different classes.

The population was 23,089 at the 2010 census. Champlin is a northern suburb of Minneapolis. U.S. Highway 169 and Hennepin County Road 12 (CR 12) are two of the main routes in Champlin. Geography Champlin lies along the Mississippi River, surrounded by the cities of Anoka, Dayton, Brooklyn Park, Maple Grove and Coon Rapids, northwest of Minneapolis. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The average elevation is above sea level, and the Mississippi River is approximately one-eighth of a mile wide throughout Champlin. History The Champlin area was first settled when Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan priest from whom Hennepin County gets its name, Michael Accult, and Peter Dulay were captured by Lakota Indians. An Indian trading post was later established in the area. Charles Miles created the first permanent settlement in what came to be named Marshall Township. In 1859, it was split into two towns, Champlin and Dayton. Champlin's name came from U.S. Navy Commodore Stephen Champlin. He was active in the war against England and Canada in 1812, and in the establishment of the Canadian‚ÄìUnited States boundary. He died in 1870 in Buffalo, New York. On August 30, 1853, Stephen Champlin's daughter, Eliza Ellen Champlin, married John B. Cook, a partner of Minnesota's Alexander Ramsey. Although Cook was never a resident of Champlin, he was involved in real estate transactions there, and in its incorporation. In 1947, part of the former Champlin Township was incorporated to form the village of Champlin, and on January 2, 1971, as the result of a petitioned order from the Minnesota Municipal Commission, Champlin Township and the village of Champlin consolidated to form the city of Champlin. Education The Champlin area is served by Anoka-Hennepin School District 11, with four primary schools, Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Oxbow Creek Elementary, Jackson Middle School and Champlin Park High School. All the schools are clustered in a neighborhood near the intersection of 109th Avenue North and Douglas Avenue North. Oxbow Creek Elementary School is in Brooklyn Park. Champlin Elementary School was built in 1938 to serve the primary educational needs of Champlin's schoolchildren. It served approximately 350 students in the 1st through 5th grades each year ‚Äî about 1/3 as many as the newer Oxbow Creek Elementary, approximately away. Champlin Elementary School received students directly from the Park View Early Childhood Center (converted to the Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science in 2011). It closed in summer 2010, due to financial cuts in the district, and has been put up for sale by the city. It merged with Riverview Elementary School to make the Champlin‚ÄìBrooklyn Academy of Math and Environmental Science. Students began attending the new school during the 2010‚Äì11 school year.http://www.parentsunited.org/1004178.html Champlin Park High School is one of the largest high schools in the state, with approximately 2,975 students in 9th through 12th grades. It is in the Northwest Suburban Conference with large athletic and music programs. Champlin Park High receives students directly from Jackson Middle School. Jackson Middle School was expanded in 2001 to become one of the largest junior high schools in the state of Minnesota. This was accomplished by the building of a completely new campus for Oxbow Creek Elementary about two blocks southwest of the existing campus. Jackson Middle School then expanded into the former Oxbow Creek Elementary building. In 2006, Jackson Middle School built an observatory, which hosts public viewing nights and provides astronomy education to both its and other Anoka‚ÄìHennepin students. Jackson Middle School is home to approximately 2,356 students in 6th through 8th grades. It receives students directly from Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Dayton Elementary School, Oxbow Creek Elementary, and Monroe Elementary. Oxbow Creek Elementary's new facility opened in 2001. It is an exact match to Andover Elementary School, as the school district used the same blueprints to build the two at the same time. Oxbow Creek Elementary provides educational services to 1,090 students in kindergarten through 5th grades. Champlin‚ÄìBrooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, formerly Park View Kindergarten, provides kindergarten through 5th grade math and environmental science education.

It is located west-southwest of downtown Minneapolis. The population was 3,642 as of the 2010 Census, down from 3,853 as of the 2000 census. History Hotel Saint Louis circa 1885 Deephaven was settled in 1876 by Saint Louis attorney Charles Gibson. Gibson built a summer house in an area known as \\"Northome\\" and began promoting the area as a vacation destination for Southerners. In 1879 he advocated for the construction of the 150-room Hotel Saint Louis, the area's first grand hotel. The community was connected to the Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railway to serve both the hotel and local cottagers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFV7MKeEwQI The Minnetonka Yacht Club was founded in Deephaven in 1882 and incorporated in 1889.https://www.minnetonkayachtclub.org/AboutUs One of the club's co- founders, Hazen Burton, built a home named \\"Chimo\\" in Deephaven in 1890. A train depot was built near the property so that the Burtons could commute to their department store in Minneapolis. The name \\"Deephaven\\" can be traced back to the name of this depot. Minnetonka Yacht Club circa 1894 In 1893 Burton commissioned local boat builder Arthur Dyer to develop a new kind of sailboat called a racing scow. When the Onawa debuted in 1893, it was disqualified for winning nearly every regatta it entered. The rules were eventually modified, however, and racing scows became popular within the sailing community worldwide.https://www.steamboatminnehaha.org/history.html The Onawa is currently displayed at the Excelsior-Lake Minnetonka Historical Society Museum in nearby Excelsior. Lake Minnetonka fell out of favor as a vacation destination in the 1890s. The Hotel Saint Louis suffered financially and was eventually demolished in 1907. In its place, Walter Donald Douglas of the Quaker Oats fortune and his wife Mahala built a twenty-seven room estate named \\"Walden.\\" Walter Douglas perished in the Titanic disaster in 1912, however, Mahala and her French maid Berthe Leroy were survivors. Mahala returned to Deephaven as a widow and lived there until her death in 1945. Deephaven's historic Cottagewood General Store, opened in 1895 by Ralph M. Chapman, served as a grocer to tourists along the shores of Lake Minnetonka. The store is one of Deephaven's most notable attractions today.

The municipality of Schermer included not only the Schermer polder, but also the polders Oterleek, Mijzenpolder, and Eilandspolder.  History  Around 800 AD, the area that was the municipality of Schermer was covered in peat, and a small river called the Schermer flowed through it. Because of peat-digging by man, and storm floods, this small river had by 1250 developed into an inland lake with an open connection with the Zuyderzee. In the 17th century private investors started draining the largest part of the lake, leaving the southern part, the Alkmaardermeer, intact.

It is the largest and most populated island of the West Frisian Islands in the Wadden Sea. The island is situated north of Den Helder, northeast of Noorderhaaks, and southwest of Vlieland.  Name  The name Texel is Frisian, but because of historical sound-changes in Dutch, where all -x- sounds have been replaced with -s- sounds (compare for instance English fox, Frisian fokse, German Fuchs with Dutch vos), the name is typically pronounced Tessel in Dutch. History The All Saints' Flood (1170) created the islands of Texel and Wieringen from North Holland. In the 13th century Ada, Countess of Holland was held prisoner on Texel by her uncle William. Texel received city rights in 1415. Texel was involved in the Battle of Scheveningen (1653) during the First Anglo-Dutch War and the Battle of Texel (1673) during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Dutch ships in the roadstead of Texel, 1671 HMS Hero wrecked at Haak Sands near Texel December 25, 1811 During the American Revolution, Texel was used as a haven port by John Paul Jones after the Battle of Flamborough Head off the Yorkshire coast in September 1779. In that action, Jones defeated and captured the British ship HMS Serapis, which he sailed to Texel for desperately needed repairs. This event further complicated Anglo-Dutch relations. Texel is famous in military history as the only place where a navy was defeated on horseback. Occupying Holland in January 1795, the French continental army learned that the Dutch navy had been frozen into the ice around Texel, so Commandant Louis Joseph Lahure and 128 men rode up to it and demanded surrender. No shots were fired. In 1797, Texel was involved in the Battle of Camperdown during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1799, HMS Lutine, a British frigate loaded with British gold, sank along the Texel coast in a storm. Her wreck shifted in the sands; despite several intensive, well financed searches, only a few treasures have been found. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mystery-of-the-sinking-of- hms-lutine-f0279pwqn A beaker made from a silver bar is displayed in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Her bell was recovered and is now in the headquarters of Lloyds of London, where it is tolled before announcing important news.https://medium.com/markelmarine/the-story-of-the-lutine-bell- ceb3e9c03e09 During the First World War in 1914, the Battle off Texel took place off the coast of Texel. On the night of 31 August 1940, the sea to the northwest of Texel was the scene of the sinking of two British destroyers and the severe damage of a third by German mines in what is known as the Texel Disaster. At the end of Second World War in 1945, the Georgian uprising on Texel took place on the island. Geography  2014 map of Texel The municipality is located at north of the mainland of the province of North Holland and west of the mainland of the province of Friesland. The island of Texel is situated north of the city of Den Helder, northeast of the uninhabited island of Noorderhaaks, which is part of the municipality, and southwest of the island of Vlieland. The island includes the seven villages: and the small townships of The island of Texel was originally made up of two islands, Texel proper to the south and Eierland to the northeast, which were connected by shoals. In the early seventeenth century, the islands were connected by a dyke to keep the North Sea from ravaging the coastal areas of Texel proper. In the mid-nineteenth century a polder completed the northern half of the island. Today, Texel forms the largest natural barrier between the North Sea and the Wadden Sea. The dune landscape along the western coast of the island is protected as Dunes of Texel National Park. = Landscape = The dune landscape on Texel is a unique habitat for wildlife. Notable areas include De Slufter, where the tide comes in and meets the dunes, forming a marshy environment rich in both fauna and flora. Texel is known for its wildlife, particularly in winter, when birds of prey and geese take up residence. About one third of Texel is a protected nature reserve.

Edina began as a small farming and milling community in the 1860s. The population was 47,941, . History Minnehaha Grange Hall Ruins of Edina Mill next to Minnehaha Creek Edina Cinema, a theater in downtown Edina that opened in 1934.Edina Cinema. cinematreasures.org. Retrieved October 9, 2017. =Settlement= Edina began as part of Richfield Township, Minnesota. By the 1870s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the Great Famine of Ireland, had come to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township. They were followed by settlers from New England and Germany, who claimed additional land near Minnehaha Creek. The Baird and Grimes neighborhoods (which are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and the Country Club District (then known as Waterville Mills) in the northeast part of Edina were among the first areas to be established. The area then known as the Cahill Settlement, at West 70th Street and Cahill Road, was also an early community center and the home of Cahill School. In 1888, the residents of the township held a meeting to consider founding a new village, thus separating themselves from Richfield Township. The idea was favorably accepted by those within the community and a committee was established to oversee the transition. = Naming = After the decision was made to form a new village, a debate ensued regarding the naming of the new village. Several town meetings were held in the Minnehaha Grange Hall, during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield and Edina were suggested. Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the Edina Mill, are summarized as follows: At the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against. There has been a prevailing myth about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities‚Äîthe Irish Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community‚Äîfought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina). The 1860 census, however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888). =Morningside= The first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village. As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character. As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village. In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina. =Early settlement= Edina was not the first settlement in its location. According to historian Deborah Morse-Kahn, the Quaker village that existed where Edina would be built included African American families of Civil War veterans and freed slaves \\"became very involved in community life‚Äîespecially as farmland owners, civic and cultural leaders.\\" At the November 1898 general election, J. Frank Wheaton, a Republican African American, was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives representing District 42, which included all of Edina. Wheaton beat his white Democratic opponent in every Minneapolis city ward and in every village within the legislative district, including Edina, even though the legislative district had only approximately 100 African American residents out of a total of 40,000 residents.William D. Green, Degrees of Freedom, The Origins of Civil Rights in Minnesota, 1865-1912, Univ. of Minn. Press, 2015, p. 235-243 =Early development= In the early 20th century suburban development brought discriminatory policies that led to nearly all of the African Americans who had been living in Edina to move away. James W. Loewen described the suburb as a sundown town. Researchers point in particular to Samuel Thorpe's development of the Country Club Historic District, which used deed restrictions as means to exclude non-whites, stating explicitly that: Other developments, like that built by N. P. Dodge Corporation just a mile away, followed suit in attempting to protect land values through racial policies. Though the Supreme Court ruled these kinds of discriminatory housing clauses unenforceable in its Shelley v. Kraemer decision of 1948, reports of discrimination persisted through the 1950s and 1960s. According to the Edina Historical Society's story about the first black family in Morningside (then a separate village) in 1960, attempts to keep them out included tactics like trying \\"to get [their] lot condemned for drainage.\\" In response, then-mayor Ken Joyce wrote a note dismissing the drainage concern and challenging citizens \\"to live the Golden Rule\\". Shortly thereafter the village voted in favor of inclusion. Jewish residents were also affected by exclusionary deed covenants. In the 1960s, some residents boasted that Edina had \\"Not one Negro and not one Jew.\\" Geography Many major highways run through or are close to Edina, making it readily accessible to those within the metropolitan area. Minnesota State Highways 62 and 100 divide the City into four sections. U.S. Highway 169 and Minnesota State Highway 100 extend north and south.

Transportation Highways 62, 100, and 169 as well as Interstate 494 go through or on the border of Edina. Before streetcar service was abandoned in 1954, the Twin City Rapid Transit Company's Lake Minnetonka Line went through Edina paralleling 44th Street on dedicated right-of-way. After streetcar service was abandoned, the right-of-way was developed as single family housing. The Dan Patch Line and successor Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway operated interurban service through Edina until 1942. Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35 mph the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the Dan Patch Corridor proposal commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades to the rail corridor. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that while ridership would be high there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line. In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line. The conclusion was to not pursue passenger rail at this time (as of 2018).

Population centres  The municipality of Uithoorn consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: De Kwakel and Uithoorn. 460px Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Uithoorn, June 2015  History  The name De Uithoorn (or also De Uythoorn) was used at the end of the Middle Ages for the location of the lower courts of the deanery of Saint John. The village formed around its courthouse. People depended on agriculture and animal husbandry. Agriculture became increasingly more difficult due to the steady soil subsidence. From c. 1600 on, peat extraction became important and resulted in the formation of large ponds, which in turn would be made into polders later on. During the Franco-Dutch War in the \\"disaster year\\" of 1672, Uithoorn was on the front lines and fortifications were built. During the Batavian Republic period, the neighbouring village of Thamen was merged with Uithoorn. Its economy was limited but improved in the middle of the 19th century when some industries (including chemical) were established in the area. The reclamation of a few large ponds provided extra agricultural land at the end of the same century. A sulphuric acid plant was established on the banks of the Amstel in 1863, it closed in the early 1900s; the site was subsequently (1922) used for a coal tar processor, Teerbedrijf Uithoorn, later known as Cindu Chemicals. A subsidiary company Nevcin Polymers also operated on the site: both companies were major employers in the town, and also polluters of the air and water bodies. In 1992 a reactor at the Nevcin site exploded, causing three deaths and several injuries. As of 2012 both plants remain in operation. Circa 1885, several fortifications were built around Uithoorn as part of the Stelling van Amsterdam. In 1915 the railway was built through town. After World War II, Uithoorn developed quickly: in 1948 the Thamerdal neighbourhood was built, followed by Zijdelwaard in 1960, Legmeer in 1972, Meerwijk-West and Meerwijk-Oost from 1985 on. In 1991 a new shopping centre was built in the town centre, at the expense of many original buildings.

Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Minnesota State Highway 55 serves as the main road in the city. Greenfield is located along the Crow River, which flows through the Downtown River District and divides Hennepin County and Wright County. Nearby towns include Loretto, Rockford, Corcoran, Hanover, Buffalo, and Maple Grove. History Before Greenfield was a town, the area was originally known as Greenwood Township.

The school district includes an elementary school (preschool to 4th grade), a middle school (grades 5th through 8th), and a high school (grades 9th through 12th). The elementary focuses mainly on an arts program, while the middle and high schools put more of an emphasis on technology. Originally, the Rockford School District was established by the Wright County commissioners on September 6, 1856, and the first school house was constructed by 1860. During the 1960s, the school underwent redistricting that gave its current designation as Independent School District #883. Although the Rockford school district serves Rockford and most of Greenfield, a small portion of Greenfield is designated to the Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose (BHM) School District #877.

It had a population of in . It lies on the river Vecht and next to the Amsterdam‚ÄìRhine Canal in an area called the Vechtstreek. Weesp is part of the Amsterdam metropolitan area even if the city is surrounded by open grassland and lakes. On 1 June 2019 the civil service offices of the municipality of Weesp merged with those of the municipality of Amsterdam in preparation of the merger of the two municipalities, which is supposed to happen on 24 March 2022.  History  Topographic map of Weesp, July 2013 Until the early Middle Ages the region around Weesp was an uninhabited peat bog. Weesp (Wesopa in Latin documents) was granted city rights in 1355 and celebrated its 650th anniversary as a town in 2005. From the late Middle Ages, the river Vecht was a defensive line for the County of Holland and it remained a military defensive line until the Second World War. Weesp was strongly fortified, more than its size would justify; for most of its history it had a few thousand inhabitants. The defensive lines consisted of inundation zones, which would be flooded in wartime (the Hollandic Water Line). Behind them were fortified towns, forts, barracks and other military structures. The most comprehensive was the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Stelling van Amsterdam), a circular inundation zone around Amsterdam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Defence line of Amsterdam on the UNESCO website After the Second World War, new housing was built in the west and an industrial zone with a harbour at the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal was constructed. In the 1970s a suburb was built on the south. Another suburb was built in the north which recently expanded with plans for further expansion. Before the reformation the church was dedicated to Saint Laurens. It is still in use for Protestant services. In the tower it has a famous carillon by Pieter Hemony cast in 1671. Following the 19th Century emancipation of Dutch Catholics, a Catholic church was erected in Weesp.  Population centres  The municipality of Weesp consists of three towns: De Horn, Uitermeer, and Weesp. The north of the town of Weesp is known for its Hogewey dementia village.  Economy  Amsterdam‚ÄìRhine Canal The most famed product of Weesp is Van Houten chocolate. Before cocoa production, the local economy had been based on beer breweries, jenever distilleries, production of Weesper porcelain, and trade, due to its location on a branch point of waterways. In the 21st century, the economy is very diverse. There were large facilities of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, until February 2010 when Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, Illinois acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals. At this site there is a chemical plant which manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredient for Abbott brands Duphalac and Duphaston and a biologic plant which manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredient for Abbott's flu vaccine Influvac. The local specialty is the Weesper Mop cookie, which is based on mashed almond.  Tourism  Weesp is a popular stop for tourists. It has a protected historical center with canals and many buildings dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Weesp has three full-size historical windmills. It features a bastion and fortifications that are part of the Defense line of Amsterdam and the Dutch Water Line. These structures have never been attacked, though. The scenic river Vecht and the small roads that line it attract yachters and cyclists. The Naardermeer area, the first nature reserve in the Netherlands, is at 15 minutes cycling distance from Weesp; it protects the Gooi landscape. The Weesp local museum is located in the town's city hall.  Local government  The municipal council of Weesp consists of 17 seats, which are divided as follows:  Transport  Weesp has one railway station, Weesp. It serves as a transfer station for passengers on local trains on the Amsterdam‚ÄìAmersfoort (Oosterspoorweg) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol‚ÄìAlmere (Schiphollijn and Flevolijn) lines, which bundle up just before Weesp and diverge right after. Weesp therefore benefits from 16 departures per hour, serving many destinations including Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Hilversum, Amersfoort Centraal and Utrecht Centraal four times per hour. In front of the railway station there is a small bus station with services to neighbouring towns and villages such as Muiden, Muiderberg, and Nigtevecht and to Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA station.

It is a former municipality in this province, with its name appearing in records of the late 9th and early 10th century. From 1200 it was known as an island, also named Wieringen, which was separated by water from the mainland during one of the disastrous storm floods towards the end of the late Middle Ages that changed the coastline. By draining, dikes and landfill from 1924 to 1932, the island was rejoined to the mainland. In the 21st century, the local governments proposed a project to restore the insular status of Wieringen by construction of a recreational lake to be called the Wieringerrandmeer. The project was cancelled in 2010 for financial reasons. Population centres The former municipality of Wieringen consisted of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Dam, De Haukes, De Hoelm, Den Oever, Hippolytushoef, Hollebalg, Noordburen, Oosterklief, Oosterland, Smerp, Stroe, Vatrop, Westerklief and Westerland.  History  The landscape of Wieringen is not all flat: it is characterised by dam ramparts of boulder clay, which were formed during the Saale Ice Age. The name Wieringen has nothing to do with \\"wier\\" (seaweed in Dutch), but this connection was often made in former days. Probably the name came from Old Frisian w√Ær = \\"height\\". = Earliest references = The first known written references to Wieringen are as \\"Wiron\\" or \\"pagus Wirense\\" in Latin in a list of property owned by the monastery at Fulda, dated late 8th century or early 9th century AD. In that list, the entries that mention Wieringen are:- :Ego Gebi tradidi ad monasterium sancti Bonifacii in pago Wirense curtilem unam cum omnibus que ad eam pertinent, terris et mancipiis, domibus et mancipiis. := \\"I, Gebi, have transferred to the monastery of St. Bonifacius in the area Wieringen one mansion with all that goes with it, land with the serfs and dwellings with the serfs.\\". :Ego Gerwic de Fresia trado sancto Bonifacio ad Fuldense monasterium terram iuris mei iuxta fluvium Maresdeop et quicquid proprietatis habui sive in agris vel pratis, silvis, domibus vel mancipiis. := \\"I, Gerwic of Friesland, transfer to St. Bonifacius of the monastery of Fulda the land that is under my jurisdiction near the river Marsdiep, and all I had in possession either fields or meadows, forests, houses or serfs.\\". ::It describes the Marsdiep as \\"fluvium Maresdeop\\": fluvium is Latin for \\"river\\"; it seems that in that time Texel and Wieringen were much bigger and spread across what is now the western end of the Waddenzee and perhaps also other areas which are now sea or have been re-empoldered since. Wieringen and Texel may have met as opposite banks of the Maresdeop (which name may mean \\"morass deep\\"), which was then an ordinary river with banks of permanent land (but perhaps a large river, as it is called a \\"deep\\"). :Ego Geltrud tradidi ad monasterium sancti Bonifacii omnem proprietatem meam in agris, silvis et de pratis ad XX carradas feni, in loco nuncupato Wictulfingafurt in pago Wironi. = \\"I, Geltrud, have transferred to the monastery of St. Bonifacius all my property in fields, forests and from the meadows to [= \\"enough land to produce\\"?] 20 cart-loads of hay, in the place named Wictulfingafurt, in the area Wieringen ...\\". Wictulfingafurt means \\"the ford of the sons or people of a man called Wictulf\\". :Ego in Dei nomine Isanbalt et uxor mea Sigibirn de Fresia tradimus ad sanctum Bonifacium in villa que dicitur Brochenlar, in pago Wirah, quicquid proprietatis habuimus, hoc est de terra arabili quantum XI modus conseri potest. = \\"In God's name I, Isanbalt and my wife Sigibirn from Friesland, transfer to St. Bonifacius in the manor which is named Brochenlar, in the area [named] Wieringen, all we had in property, that is of ploughland as much as can be sowed with 11 measures [of seed].\\" ::The places Wictulfingafurt and Brochenlar cannot now be found, and their sites are likeliest now under the sea, or under some polder which has been made since. :Ego Hunbertus tradidi ad sanctum Bonifacium quicquid mihi in regione Fr√©sionum in pago Wirah mei reliquere parentes in hereditatem, cunctamque meam possessionem, hoc est in terris, agris, pratis, pascuis, silvis, aquis, domibus ac familiis. = \\"I, Hunbertus, have transferred to St. Bonifacius whatever in the region of the Frisians in the area Wieringen my parents left me in inheritance, and my complete possessions, that it in fields, meadows, grassland, forests, waters, dwellings, and all the families [= \\"inhabitants of that estate\\"]\\". ::These gifts are all dated between 800AD and 820AD and include 5 manors. A possessions list of the St. Martin's church in Utrecht, dated 948, lists a church domain with 12 farms at Alvitlo (= De Elft), and 72 [probably mostly small] farms at Strude (= Stroe). Both these places still exist and are in Wieringen. The amount of property in land in these two lists composed an area larger than the modern (up to 1924) island of Wieringen. = Later history = In 1996 silver treasure was found in a pasture at the hamlet of Westerklief. It has been dated to the 9th century and is attributed to Vikings, who likely had an operating base there. The treasure is approx. 1.7 kilograms of silver coins and jewels, and small silver ingots. It now can be seen in the Rijksmuseum voor Oudheden in Leiden. Some years later smaller silver treasures from the same period were found in this area, confirming the theories of origin. Wieringen became an island around 1200 as a result of successive storm floods that surrounded it with water. This status lasted for more than 700 years. The All Saints' Flood (1170) created the islands of Wieringen and Texel from North Holland. The larger area was inhabited and controlled by Frisians, until the Dutch count Floris V made the Wieringers subject in 1284. Afterwards the area was unquiet for a time. Since 1297 it was directly under the county of Holland, for it fell under Westfriesland, for a time under Frisian rule. In 1299 the county of Holland retook Holland and Westfriesland. Wieringen was included in the district of Westfriesland. In 1432 all the island of Wieringen officially was designated as one township and received city rights. But as more of Holland and Westfriesland were developed and became more habitable, the importance of Wieringen decreased. An 1849 map of the island Wieringen A 1909 map of the island Wieringen In 1798 when the Batavian Republic formed, the province of Holland and West Friesland was divided differently: it fell under the d√©partement of Texel (from the Vlie to the Rhine). In 1807 under Napoleon, the province was subdivided into two separate provinces; Amstelland and Maasland, but this organization ended in 1814. In 1815 Holland with Westfriesland became a province of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. To reduce the dominance of the province of Holland, in 1840 under King Willem I, it was split into the provinces of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland. Since then Wieringen has been within the province of Noord- Holland. In the early 20th century, Wieringen was known as the place of exile of German crown prince Wilhelm, who received political asylum after fleeing with his father Wilhelm II from Flanders to the Netherlands in November 1918 during the German Revolution. Wilhelm II went into exile in Doorn. The crown prince settled on the island on 22 November 1918, where he stayed until his return to Germany on 10 November 1923. During this time he learned how to forge horseshoes at the blacksmithy in Hippolytushoef. On 31 July 1924 the Amsteldiep was closed by a short dam called the Amsteldiepdijk. In 1930 the Eastern Wieringermeerdijk was completed in the Zuiderzee, and with it the adjacent polder the Wieringermeer. The closing of the Zuiderzee was completed in 1932 by the Afsluitdijk, a large dike which connects Wieringen with Friesland, making it part of the mainland again. This dike starts at Den Oever.

Hassan was located along the south bank of the Crow River and bisected by Interstate 94, approximately northwest of downtown Minneapolis. The City of Rogers lay entirely within the original township. Hassan's rolling landscape was composed of farmsteads, cultivated fields, scattered homes and subdivisions separated by wetlands, woodlands, and drainageways. Settlement in 1854 by European immigrants brought about major changes in the landscape of what is now Hassan Township. Originally, as part of the \\"Big Woods\\", the areas was heavily timbered with oak, elm, basswood, ash, and maple. Large areas of marshland also existed. As settlers arrived, the woods were cleared and the land was tilled for farmstead construction and crop production. Early on, small trade centers, known as hamlets, emerged in Hassan Township to serve the needs of the settlers. The hamlet of Hassan was first settled in 1854 and then organized in 1860 along Territorial Road in Section 21. Between 1854 and 1881, Hassan contained a clustering of houses, a post office, St. John's Episcopal Church, a school and a town hall. Today, an altered school, a church and town hall remain. Today, a few businesses still thrive in Hassan, including Hassan Sand and Gravel, Minuteman Services, and Town and Country Landscaping, among others. Although not the earliest settlement, Fletcher, originally named St. Walburga by German immigrants, has become the most notable. It stands at the intersection of Territorial Road and County Road 116 (Fletcher Lane) in Hassan Township. Fletcher is considered to be the \\"finest example of a traditional crossroads hamlet in Hennepin County\\" and is eligible to become a historic district by the Minnesota Historical Society. Territorial Road crosses over a series of ridges, including a section that includes the highest point in Hennepin County. It was authorized by the Territorial Legislature in 1855 and identified as the \\"first legitimate outlet\\" for this section of Hennepin County. Through the years, it became a major transportation route for Hassan Township and surrounding communities \\"because it was maintained and it provided relatively easy access to Minneapolis markets.\\" (Hennepin History Museum; 1995).

Since 2012 Wieringermeer has been a part of the new municipality of Hollands Kroon.  Population centres  The former municipality of Wieringermeer consisted of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Kreileroord, Middenmeer, Slootdorp, Wieringerwerf.  History  Around the year 1000 AD, this area was land. However, several storms after 1100 flooded the land, turning it into a flood plain. Wieringmeer means \\"Wieringen Lake\\", the name of an inland lake that filled the area in the early medieval period. The Wieringmeerpolder is a polder, newly created land, and part of the Zuiderzee Works developed in the 20th century. The creation of this polder started in 1927. Originally the polder was planned to have been created after the completion of the Afsluitdijk. As there was a severe lack of agricultural ground, the dikes for the polder had to be built in the Zuiderzee, a sea. The dikes had to be tougher and ready to withstand the force of the sea. Draining of the polder was finished on 21 August 1930. After the completion of the Afsluitdijk in 1932, the lake IJsselmeer was formed from the waters. The huge Lely pumping station lies at the southern end of Wieringermeer near Medemblik and functions to keep the polder dry. After desalinization, the new land became usable in 1934. Four villages (Slootdorp (1931), Middenmeer (1933), Wieringerwerf (1936) and Kreileroord (1957)) eventually were developed in the polder. Since 1 July 1941, the Wieringermeer had been an independent municipality. During the Second World War, the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany. On 17 April 1945, a vengeful German command ordered the dike of the Wieringermeer to be blown up: the area was inundated. No one was killed as the polder slowly submerged again (the inhabitants had been warned), but the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. The floodwater was fresh water, so the land did not have to be desalinated again. Reconstruction followed quickly; by the end of 1945, the polder was declared drained again. Rebuilding of roads and bridges, houses and farms, was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time.

Wognum received city rights in 1392 but lost them in 1426. In 2007 it merged with the municipalities of Medemblik and Noorder- Koggenland into the surviving municipality of Medemblik.  Population centres  The former municipality of Wognum consisted of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Nibbixwoud, Wognum, Zwaagdijk-West, and the hamlet of Wijzend. History Wognum is an ancient place. The place was formed around 900, which is confirmed by archaeological finds. In addition, there seems to be proof, that the area was already inhabited around the Bronze Age. Hand axes and arrowheads from that period were found in the area between the current streets of Oosterwijzend and Dorpsstraat in Wognum. In 980 the city was first mentioned in a church list of the Abbey of Echternach. The place was named as Wokgunge. In 1063 the city came known as Woggunghem in a charter. There was a chapel where now stands the Reformed Church of Wognum. This chapel belonged to the abbey of Heiloo. Later spellings included Wognem (1083), Woghenem (1156) and Woggenum (1544). The place could refer to the place of the person or family Wok or Wokke. In addition to the West Frisian name Woggem and Woggelum the name was sometimes even (incorrectly) written Wochnum analogous to Wochmar and the old Dutch Wochmeer (Wogmeer). Wognum is located on the shore of an ancient stream. The shore is composed of sandy soil. Just outside the residential center it is located between Oude Gouw - Kerkstraat and the old peat streams at Baarsdorpermeer / Lekermeer. This is a remnant of the reclamation period from the early Middle Ages. This includes the Kromme Leek, a stream which starts at the Baarsdorpermeer meandering along Wognum through Zwaagdijk and ends at Medemblik. The winding course is preserved as much as possible at the time of the later land consolidation between Wognum and Medemblik. In the 15th century, fishing was the main source of income. Wognum benefited in the 17th century greatly from the shipping industry of the nearby city of Hoorn. Despite the fact that Wognum had an agricultural character in the 19th century, when in 1979 a new coats of arms for the newly amalgamated municipality Wognum was created, the three basses from the amalgamated municipality of Nibixwoud appeared on the coat of arms. In both Wognum as well as Nibbixwoud there are thousands of fruit trees. Fruit was an important part of the agricultural sector. The layout of Wognum is a combination of agricultural buildings and more urban development in the center. Museum / Railway connections Wognum is one of the stops of the historical railway between Hoorn and Medemblik.

Zandvoort is known to exist in 1100, called Sandevoerde (a combination of \\"sand\\" and \\"voorde\\", meaning ford; compare English Sandford). Until 1722 the area was under the control of the Lords of Brederode. The village was dependent on fishing for many centuries until the 19th century when it started to transform itself into a seaside resort, following the pattern set by similar towns in the United Kingdom. In 1828 the first resort was inaugurated. Thereafter many notable persons would visit Zandvoort, including Elisabeth of Bavaria in 1884 and 1885. In the middle of the same century, potato cultivation started in the dunes. In 1881 the railway station near the coast opened, followed by tram connection to Haarlem in 1899, which greatly increased the beach tourism. In 1905 one of the earliest Dutch fictional films was shot in the town, De m√©saventure van een Fransch heertje zonder pantalon aan het strand te Zandvoort. During World War II, Zandvoort was heavily damaged. On May 23, 1942, beach access was no longer permitted and several months later the town was almost completely vacated. Resorts and avenues were demolished to make way for the coastal fortifications of the Atlantic Wall. After the war, the town's growth accelerated, matching the growth in tourism. In 1948, Circuit Zandvoort was built, hosting the Dutch Grand Prix for several decades, until 1985. The Dutch GP will return in 2021, in the 2021 Formula One World Championship. Zandvoort continues to be a major Dutch resort location, where nearly half of all employment is related to tourism.

The population was 1,768 at the 2010 census.  History  The first settlers arrived in Long Lake in early spring, 1855. This early contact in Long Lake did not result in settlement but rather this group of Nova Scotians came down Watertown Road, walked to the lake, looked across the lake and settled on the north side of the lake in what is now Orono. The first permanent settlement was established in May 1855 with the arrival of the Flemings and the George Knettles from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. This first settlement was named Cumberland Town and consisted of a saw mill, general store and schoolhouse. The platted area Cumberland Addition can trace its roots to this early period. The Knettle's house became a favorite stop for travelers between 1855 and 1860 and is the location of the first public religious service in the community. The first post office was established in 1856, which was named Tamarack in recognition of the Tamarack swamps in the western part of the country. A significant aspect of the early settlement of Long Lake was the relationship between the Dakota, the Chippewa and the settlers. The origin of the Union Cemetery is found in this tripartite relationship. The area where the cemetery is located was called Teepee Hill in these early years. It served as an encampment for the Chippewa in 1859‚Äì1860. The Dakota were informed of the location of the Chippewa through two settlers in the area. This information prompted many of the Dakota to be in and around Long Lake. Although there was no fighting and the actual intentions of the Dakota are not clear, their presence in the area forced the Chippewa to vacate Teepee Hill. This area was acquired by Bradford Wakefield, most probably through squatter's rights, and purchased by Union Cemetery Association in 1861. There was concern among the settlers that the Chippewa would return, so by establishing a cemetery (hallowed ground) it was unlikely that any Native American people would choose that site as an encampment, thus assuring the safety of the surrounding area. During the middle to late 19th century, Long Lake developed like many other towns. A sawmill was erected (1866), the railroad reached Long Lake (1868), a school district was organized (1869), a general store was started (1870), the Freethinkers Hall was organized (1874), a flour mill was established (1875), and a hotel was added (1875). These institutions were all-important elements to early town development in the Upper Midwest. The late 1890s ‚Äì early 1900s became known as the berry years in Long Lake. The Minnesota Fruit Growers Association was established in Long Lake in 1898 to focus on promoting strawberry and raspberry production. These products became a regional specialty with shipments going as far as Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota. The catalyst for the expansion of the city limits was a desire by Long Lake's neighbors to take advantage of the city's decision to install a sewer system. Those areas that wanted to be connected to city sewer were annexed by the city. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. West Wayzata Boulevard (Old Highway 12), now Hennepin County Road 112, and U.S. Highway 12 both serve as the main routes in the community.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 2,430, and in 2018 the estimated population was 2,757. It is said that \\"Osseo\\" is derived from the Ojibwe name waaseyaa meaning \\"there is light\\", although more commonly known as \\"Son of the Evening Star\\". Henry W. Longfellow mentions Osseo in his poem The Song of Hiawatha. It is claimed that Longfellow visited Osseo while in St. Anthony. History Osseo in 1869 The area that is now Osseo was settled before organized local government. It was on what Pierre Bottineau named \\"Bottineau Prairie\\" in 1852, and the community was called Palestine. In 1856 part of the town was platted as Osseo and another part as \\"City of Attraction\\". Official Minnesota Territory surveys placed the settlement on the border of two townships. When Brooklyn Township and Maple Grove Township organized, Osseo (and City of Attraction, which later merged) was governed by those two governments. Osseo incorporated on March 17, 1875. The ethnic groups that moved in after Native tribes were removed were mostly French Canadians, New Englanders, Swiss and Germans. The pioneers' businesses included blacksmiths, wagonmakers, general merchandise stores, boots & shoemakers, harness makers, tin shops, cordwood suppliers, teamsters, saloons, and hotels (Niggler Hotel 1867, International Hotel 1874, Great Northern Hotel, 1907). There was also a Catholic church (1858), a physician, school, post office, and calaboose (jail). Methodist and Lutheran pioneers were served in their homes until the 20th century. In 1882 the Great Northern Railroad \\"came steaming through town\\", and in 1893 a telephone station appeared. A town hall was built in 1901. The city water system and fire department began in 1915. The original Indian trail‚Äîextending from St. Paul to St. Cloud‚Äîwas the town's main street, and was paved in 1918 (Territorial Road). The Osseo Lutheran Church was built approximately 1915; the Methodist Church was built in 1922. The first Osseo High School was built in 1924. 1928 was the peak when \\"Osseo had one of the largest potato markets in the Northwest.\\" \\"The Father of Osseo\\" was described in a newspaper article written at the death of John Hechtman, and informs the reader of Osseo's opportunities and social organizations of his time.Minneapolis Tribune, October 22, 1902. Opposite today's City Hall are memorials to US military veterans from Osseo. In 1937 a large granite monument was erected in memory of Civil War soldiers. On Memorial Day 1945 another Honor Roll was constructed of granite with a bronze plate engraved with names of those who served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I and World War II. In 1957 the memorial area was named Father Boerboom Park, after a pastor of St. Vincent Rectory and the principal of its parochial school who had served since 1917. The Osseo Water Tower, built in 1915, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

It took place primarily in the British provinces of New York, Massachusetts Bay (which included Maine as well as Massachusetts at the time), New Hampshire (which included Vermont at the time), and Nova Scotia.

Causes The War of Jenkins' Ear (named for a 1731 incident in which a Spanish commander sliced off the ear of British merchant captain Robert Jenkins and told him to take it to his king, George II) broke out in 1739 between Spain and Great Britain, but was restrained to the Caribbean Sea and conflict between Spanish Florida and the neighboring British Province of Georgia. The War of the Austrian Succession, nominally a struggle over the legitimacy of the accession of Maria Theresa to the Austrian throne, began in 1740, but at first did not involve either Britain or Spain militarily. Britain was drawn diplomatically into that conflict in 1742 as an ally of Austria and an opponent of France and Prussia, but open hostilities between them did not take place until 1743 at Dettingen. War was not formally declared between Britain and France until March 1744. Massachusetts did not declare war against Quebec and France until June 2. Course of the war Acadia in 1743, the year before King George's War had begun. Major battles of the war are marked on the map. News of war declarations reached the French fortress at Louisbourg first, on May 3, 1744, and the forces there wasted little time in beginning hostilities. Concerned about their overland supply lines to Quebec, they raided the British fishing port of Canso on May 23, and then organized an attack on Annapolis Royal, the capital of Nova Scotia. But French forces were delayed in departing Louisbourg, and their Mi'kmaq and Maliseet First Nations allies, together with Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, decided to attack on their own at Fort Anne in early July. Annapolis had received news of the war declaration, and the British forces were somewhat prepared when the First Nations warriors began besieging Fort Anne. Lacking heavy weapons, the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet withdrew after a few days. Then, in mid-August, a larger French force arrived at Fort Anne, but it was also unable to mount an effective attack or siege against the garrison. The fort had received supplies and reinforcements from Massachusetts. In 1745, British colonial forces captured Fortress Louisbourg after a siege of six weeks. In retaliation, the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia launched the Northeast Coast Campaign (1745) against the British settlements on the border of Acadia in northeast Maine. France launched a major expedition to recover Louisbourg in 1746. Beset by storms, disease, and finally the death of its commander, the Duc d'Anville, the expedition's survivors returned to France in tatters without reaching its objective. captured the Fortress of Louisbourg in July 1745. The war was also fought on the frontiers between the northern British colonies and New France. Each side had allies among the Native Americans, and outlying villages were raided and captives taken for ransom, or sometimes adoption by Native American tribes who had suffered losses to disease or warfare. As a result of the frequent raiding on the northern frontier, Governor William Shirley ordered the construction of a chain of frontier outposts stretching west to its border with New York. On November 28, 1745, the French with their Indian allies raided and destroyed the village of Saratoga, New York, killing or capturing more than one hundred of its inhabitants. After this, the British abandoned their settlements in New York north of Albany, a major trading city. In July 1746 an Iroquois and intercolonial force assembled in northern New York for a retaliatory attack against Canadian forces. When the expected British regulars never arrived, the attack was called off. A large (1,000+ man) French and First Nations force mustered to raid in the upper Hudson River valley in 1746 instead raided in the Hoosac River valley, including an attack on Fort Massachusetts (at present-day North Adams, Massachusetts). This was in retaliation for the slaying of an Indian leader in an earlier skirmish. Other raids included the 1747 French and Mi'kmaq raid on Grand Pr√©, Nova Scotia; and a raid in 1748 by Indian allies of the French against Schenectady, New York. Aftermath Halifax in 1749. Fighting in Nova Scotia between the British, and the Acadian and Mi'kmaq militias continued even after the signing of the peace treaty. The war took a heavy toll, especially in the northern British colonies. The losses of Massachusetts men alone in 1745‚Äì46 have been estimated as 8% of that colony's adult male population. According to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louisbourg was returned to France three years later, in exchange for the city of Madras in India, which had been captured by the French from the British. This decision outraged New Englanders, particularly Massachusetts colonists who had contributed the most to the expedition (in terms of funding and personnel). The British government eventually acknowledged Massachusetts' effort with a payment of ¬£180,000 after the war. The province used this money to retire its devalued paper currency. The peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes. Tensions remained in both North America and Europe. They broke out again in 1754, with the start of the French and Indian War in North America, which spread to Europe two years later as the Seven Years' War. Between 1749 and 1755 in Acadia and Nova Scotia, the fighting continued in Father Le Loutre's War.

The population was 580 at the 2010 census. Hokah is located near the confluence of the Root River and the Mississippi River, opposite La Crosse, Wisconsin, and is part of the La Crosse metropolitan area. History Welcome sign along state highway 16 Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area that is now the city of Hokah was a Native American settlement of the Dakota people. The city's name, which is said to be a Native American word meaning gar fishhttp://www.cityofhokah- mn.gov/documents/History-of-Hokah.pdf or the Dakota name for the nearby Root River, derives from the chief of the settlement, Chief Wecheschatope Hokah. There were, at one time, more than thirty Indian mounds throughout the area including several effigy mounds, though most have been lost.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dgarvey/Mounds/Hokah_Effigy_Mounds.html The first recorded European settler in Hokah was Edward Thompson, who arrived in 1851 with his wife and family and constructed a flour mill and dam on Thompson Creek, a tributary of the Root River that runs through the city and now bears his name.http://genealogytrails.com/minn/houston/twphistory_hokah.htm The first town meeting was held in 1858, and the town was officially incorporated into a village by the state of Minnesota on March 2, 1871. By 1875, Hokah had several major industries including four flour mills, cooper shops and a railroad depot, driven by the city's location on the navigable Root River near where it empties into the Mississippi River as well as the Root River Valley Railroad which ran through the north end of the village from nearby La Crescent to Rochester, Minnesota. The railroad depot was equipped for all types of railroad work, including the construction of railroad locomotives and coaches. The depot employed as many as 500 workers and constructed as many as 300 coaches in one year.http://lacrossetribune.com/houstonconews/news/local/hokah- railroad-shops-had-huge-impact-on- area/article_d6037d5f-2f05-55f8-8626-53f0e3619d4f.html As of 1880, Hokah also had a plow factory, a furniture factory, three blacksmith shops, a shoe shop, two drug stores, and six general stores. In 1876, a railroad bridge was constructed across the Mississippi River from La Crosse, connecting the Root River Valley Railroad to the railroads across the river in La Crosse. In 1880, the Root River Valley Railroad was purchased by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the railroad depot in Hokah was razed in favor of other facilities elsewhere, leaving several hundred workers without employment and causing many people to leave the area. Hokah's other industries suffered from this loss of population and many of the other local businesses eventually closed. Hokah city hall, built in 1938 On April 23, 1923, the village was reincorporated as a city. Hokah City Hall, built by the Works Progress Administration in 1938, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.http://lacrossetribune.com/houstonconews/news/local/a-different-kind- of-registration-for-historic-hokah-city- hall/article_acacb6b8-9910-547c-9e90-93c5a4cfb0cf.html On August 19, 2007, 15.10 inches of rain fell in Hokah over a 24-hour period, breaking the previous 24-hour rainfall record for the state of Minnesota of 10.84 inches set on July 22, 1972 in Fort Ripley, Minnesota.http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/24hour_rain_record.html This rainfall was part of the weather system that caused the 2007 Midwest flooding and caused widespread damage throughout Hokah and surrounding communities including landslides, damaged and destroyed homes, and washed-out roads. Hokah also holds the record for the most rainfall in any month for the state of Minnesota at 23.86 inches, also set in August, 2007. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Modern-day Como Falls Hokah's location in the Driftless Area of southeastern Minnesota gives it a hilly landscape dominated by high bluffs and low river valleys known as coulees. The city's downtown is set on a small bluff between the Root River valley and the Thompson Creek valley. At the east end of downtown is Thompson Bluff, also known as Mt. Tom, a bluff that rises more than 400 feet above downtown. Like Thompson Creek, Thompson Bluff is named for Edward Thompson. Postcard depicting Lake Como circa 1909 Hokah was home to Como Falls, a waterfall on Thompson Creek. From 1858 until the 1930s Hokah was also home to Lake Como, a 90-acre, 20-foot deep man-made lake created by building a dam on Thompson Creek at Como Falls. Lake Como was a popular vacation spot in its heyday, drawing visitors from La Crosse and the surrounding area with lakeside cabins and boat rentals. The dam that created Lake Como failed during a flood in 1909 and allowed the lake to drain but was rebuilt in 1922. By the late 1930s, soil erosion from nearby farms prior to the widespread local use of contour plowing caused the lake bed to fill in, bringing about the end of Lake Como. Until August 2018, the site of Lake Como was used as a community park, pool, and baseball field. A severe storm in late August 2018 dumped almost 8 inches of rain in the area in less than 24 hours, causing massive damage to the park and rerouting the path of water around the rock formation that made up Como Falls, basically destroying the falls. Transportation Hokah is located approximately six miles west- southwest of downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin, or about nine miles by automobile via the Mississippi River Bridge in La Crescent. Minnesota State Highway 44 passes directly through downtown Hokah and has its northern terminus at an intersection with Minnesota State Highway 16 northeast of downtown. Minnesota State Highway 16 passes just north of downtown. Minnesota State Highway 26, which follows the Mississippi River and serves as part of the Great River Road, passes just to the east of Hokah. Two nearby motor vehicle bridges span the Mississippi River and connect the southeastern corner of Minnesota to the La Crosse area in Wisconsin: six miles north of Hokah, the Mississippi River Bridge carries U.S. Route 14 and U.S. Route 61 and connects downtown La Crescent, Minnesota to downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin, and eight miles north of Hokah, the I-90 Mississippi River Bridge in Dresbach, Minnesota carries Interstate 90 across the Mississippi River to northern La Crosse and Onalaska, Wisconsin. South of Hokah, the nearest place for vehicles to cross the Mississippi River is at the Black Hawk Bridge, thirty miles away in Lansing, Iowa. The nearby La Crosse Amtrak station provides daily service for the Empire Builder Amtrak route, and the La Crosse Regional Airport provides daily service to Chicago and Minneapolis via American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

Its North Sea beaches make it a popular destination for tourists. In 2001, the municipality was formed from a merger of the former municipalities of Egmond, Schoorl, and the smaller community of Bergen proper that had existed since 1811. Since about 1900, Bergen has been the home of many painters, writers and architects. Some of the work of this \\"Bergen School\\" is on exhibit at Museum Kranenburgh. The neighbourhood of Park Meerwijk, constructed in 1915, is made up entirely of villas in Amsterdam School style. There are regular art fairs in Bergen, as well as an annual music festival (the Holland Music Sessions in August) and arts festival (the Kunsttiendaagse in October). North of the town of Bergen are the Schoorlse Duinen, a nature area with the highest and widest dunes of the Netherlands, which reach about 59m (195 ft) above sea level, and are more than wide in some places. Other points of interest in the municipality include the aquarium in the seaside village of Bergen aan Zee, the Auto Union Museum in Bergen with a collection of classic cars, and the historical museums Het Sterkenhuis (Bergen) and Museum van Egmond (Egmond aan Zee). The town of Bergen is home to the European School, Bergen. Population centres Topographic map of Bergen (North Holland), June 2015 The municipality of Bergen consists of the following towns, villages and/or districts: Bergen, Aagtdorp, Bergen aan Zee, Bregtdorp, Camperduin, Catrijp, Egmond aan den Hoef, Egmond aan Zee, Egmond- Binnen, Groet, Hargen, Rinnegom, Schoorl, Schoorldam (partly), Wimmenum. History The Ruinekerk church The Egmond Abbey, founded in the 10th century, became the most important cultural center of medieval Holland. The abbey was protected by the House of Egmond, which eventually became a powerful noble family. The three towns of Egmond have been mentioned since the 10th century as well. Both the Egmond Abbey and Egmond Castle in Egmond aan den Hoef were destroyed in 1573 on order of William the Silent during the Dutch Revolt. The town of Bergen developed around a chapel and is mentioned as far back as the tenth century as well. An old local legend is the \\"Miracle of Bergen\\", which is said to have occurred during the St. Elisabeth's Flood of 1421. The story goes that the schout (sheriff) of Bergen found a chest containing hosts (the thin wafers used in Holy Communion) from the church of Petten which had floated to Bergen during the flood. The seawater that penetrated the chest had turned into blood. There is also a second miracle story, thought to have occurred in 1422, whereby hosts turned into blood. On the site where the miracle of Bergen is said to have happened, a chapel was erected. Bergen became a place of pilgrimage, and Roman-Catholic processions were held at the site for centuries and are still ongoing today. In the fifteenth century, the Ru√Ønekerk (\\"Ruined Church\\") was built on the site of the chapel and at the time was the largest of its kind in the province of North Holland. In 1574, during the Eighty Years War against Spain, the church was looted and burned down by Dutch Protestants, but was later rebuilt to its current state. In 1797, the Battle of Camperdown, a major naval action between the British and Batavian (Dutch) fleets, was fought off the coast of Camperduin, part of the municipality of Bergen. It was the most significant action between British and Dutch forces during the French Revolutionary Wars and resulted in a complete victory for the British, who captured 11 Dutch ships without losing any of their own. And in 1799, a British-Russian army invaded North-Holland. At Bergen, a battle with the French-Batavian armies took place on 19 September. The Russisch Monument in Bergen commemorates this Battle of Bergen. Bergen was one of the main stations on the narrow-gauge railway between Alkmaar and Bergen aan Zee, which ran between 1905 and 1955. One of the locomotives which operated on this line, 'Bello' stood for many years in the town centre as a memorial, and is now preserved at the Museumstoomtram Hoorn - Medemblik.

Culture Wawina has the distinction of having America's smallest telephone company. Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota (Area Code 218-488) serves fewer than 40 subscribers. It gained brief fame as the last place in the continental United States to use a trunking system (inter-office circuits) that was called \\"N2 Carrier\\", an analog system that utilized Multi-Frequency (MF) tones and the infamous 2600 Hz control tone for answer supervision and idle trunk condition. This system was much loved by phone phreaks as it was the same system which the now infamous John Draper made famous. The era ended in June 2006, when the privately owned exchange switched to a digital trunk. Phone hacking attempts from across the nation had placed a large burden on the extremely small telephone company serving the township.http://www.phworld.org/sounds/wawina References Category:Townships in Itasca County, Minnesota Category:Townships in Minnesota ","title":"Wawina Township, Itasca County, Minnesota"},{"id":"120360","text":"Wildwood Township is a township in Itasca County, Minnesota, United States.

Bishop Freking was one of 19 children of his father (by two wives), and the Bishop's brothers' and sisters' descendants, through blood and marriage, include a very large percentage of the inhabitants of the town. Many descendants of the Bishop's father have distinguished themselves outside the area, including Blake Freking, who has finished (but not won) the Iditarod dog-sled race at least twice. Walter Mondale, Vice-President of the United States under Jimmy Carter (1977‚Äì1981) and the Democratic Party's nominee for President in 1984, attended Heron Lake Public High School and lived in the Methodist Episcopal Church parsonage, since moved, for three years prior to 1946. His father was minister at the church during that time. At that time, Protestants were vigorously discriminated against by the majority of Catholics, including frequent 'boys- will-be-boys' raids against the parsonage where Mondale lived. The local voters, unlike the rest of Minnesota, voted overwhelmingly against Mondale in the 1984 election. The election statistics can easily be found online. Inkpaduta, a Sioux Indian leader in the area from the 1850s until his departure to join Sitting Bull's band in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, camped at the south end of the lake that gives the town its name both before and after his participation in the Spirit Lake massacre of 1857, and the Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux uprising.History of the Spirit Lake Massacre and Captivity of Miss Abbie Gardner, Des Moines: Iowa Printing Co 1885. Local oral history, not known to have been published, records that Inkpaduta camped at the \\"lone oak\\" adjacent to the lake, and that the same site became the pioneer home of the Peter (sometimes 'Peters') family, still to this day the most- ancient still-surviving European-American family identified with the town of Heron Lake. Walter Abel, an actor of some success in the first half of the twentieth century, lived in the town for some part of his formative years. His earliest and probably best-known role was as D'Artagnan in 1935 version of The Three Musketeers. Much of his reputation was built on his ability to die dramatically (such as by falling off a building) when shot on film. No one extant in the town in 2017 even knows anyone who ever met him, based on the ambient knowledge of a local person. Several residents at the time claimed to have seen Al Capone in the town at one point during Prohibition. The town was on the route from the Twin Cities to Sioux City at the time, so the reports are intriguingly plausible if not substantiated. This is based on a report by two of the elder Freking brothers recounted by a third-generation Freking in the 1970s.

A post office has been in operation at Okabena since 1880. =Bank Robbery= abandoned hideout On May 19, 1933, the Okabena Bank was robbed by Bonnie and Clyde. After leaving the bank, the outlaws' car sped through Okabena, spraying the town with machine-gun fire. Schoolchildren ducked behind trees and bullets sliced through walls and shattered windows. They escaped on a country road with approximately $2500 (approximately $44,000 in 2013 dollars). \\"Fugitives: The Story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker\\" as told to Emma Parker Kruse and Nellie Barrow Cowan p. 163 Three other people (Tony, Floyd and Mildred Strain) were sent to prison for the crime, and it was not recognized for many years that the real robbers were the infamous Bonnie and Clyde Gang. Investigation & Trial Parker's playful pose with a cigar branded her in the press as a \\"cigar-smoking gun moll\\" when police found the undeveloped film in the Joplin hideoutIn 1933 alone, 32 banks were robbed in Minnesota. The FBI did not investigate bank robberies until 1934, so the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the Jackson County Sheriff were responsible for solving the crime. Agent William Conly of the Minnesota BCA was provided with eyewitness descriptions matching the appearances of Tony and Floyd Strain. The description of the incident also described a woman involved as the get away driver, who was presumed to be Mildred Strain and later matched by eyewitnesses. They were local criminals who were suspected in a number of other local bank heists. After two quick trials, they were convicted by Jackson County juries, and Tony and Floyd were sentenced to 10-80 years and Mildred was sentenced to 5-40 years, as she was only the getaway driver, a less serious offence. The trio were also suspected of robbing banks in the Minnesota towns of Chandler, Ihlen, Madison, Russell and Westbrook and the South Dakota towns of Canova, Vermillion, Kaylor and Huron. However, events in later years made clear that the trio could not have been responsible for those other bank robberies. Mildred insisted she was framed for the Okabena robbery until she was released from Shakopee Women's Prison in 1942 and two officers of the Sioux City, Iowa police department at that time were watching her at her residence on the day of the robbery. Tony and Floyd also maintained their innocence until they were released from Stillwater Penitentiary in 1946. Later Evidence Years after Bonnie and Clyde had died, a book was ghost-written by Bonnie's mother and Clyde's sister, claiming that Bonnie and Clyde had robbed the bank in Okabena, along with Clyde's brother Buck Barrow and Buck's wife Blanche Barrow. Another book written by Blanch Barrow made the same claim.\\"My Life with Bonnie and Clyde\\" by Blanche Caldwell Barrow, Esther L. Weiser Shortly before the Okabena robbery, police in Joplin, Missouri raided a house used by Bonnie and Clyde as a hide-out. In the house they found undeveloped rolls of film of Bonnie and Clyde brandishing pistols and machine guns, along with several poems of their exploits written by Bonnie. The poems and the photos were later published in newspapers, making the pair famous,Jeff Guinn, \\"Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde\\"(New York: Simon and Schuster, 2009),162-176 but by this time, the Strains had been convicted. The Strain trio maintained their innocence, right up to their deaths, Tony in 1970, Mildred in 1974, and Floyd in 1994. The town of Okabena now recognizes the real robbers, and re-enacts the bank heist every year as part of their Fourth of July festival. According to Professor Brad Chislom, historian at St. Cloud State University, ‚ÄúBonnie and Clyde, along with Buck and Blanche Barrow, robbed the bank at Okabena. The residents of Jackson County who helped convict the Strains no doubt acted in good faith; vital information had been concealed from them. Bank robberies were occurring at an alarming rate in 1933. At Okabena, over-zealous, dishonest investigators placed a higher value on clearing the rash of cases than on getting at the truth, and the Strains paid the price. Only history can clear their names now.‚Äù Okabena: A Bank Robbery Revisited by Brad Chisholm Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Originally, the community was called \\"Mud Creek\\" after the creek that flows through the community and that the railroad tracks crossed; the Ojibwe population in the area, though, called the creek Basa'igani-ziibiwishenh (\\"Creek to square Cedar Timbers\\"), thus calling the community Basa'igani-ziibiwishenying (\\"By the Creek to Square Cedar Timbers\\"). When the depot was built, the name was changed to \\"Quamba,\\" which according to the railway officials was derived from an Indian word for \\"mudhole\\"; most likely the name derives from the Ottawa word: zhash _kwiimbaa_ kmigaa (fully vocalized as azhashki-wiimbaakamigaa: \\"be a muddy hole in the ground\\").
