Purpose and Content  In approximately 963 CE, Bishop √Üthelwold of Winchester required the monks of New Minster, under threat of eviction, to adopt Benedictine rule. This decision was made with the approval of King Edgar, who reigned in England from 959 until his death in 975. The charter was officially created as a codex to compile and present the royal grants which established the new laws of the New Minster, later to become Hyde Abbey. It is one of 34 surviving documents from the pre-Conquest archive of the New Minster, and stands out as an authentic document among numerous forgeries of its time. The text consists of 22 short chapters which outline the creation and fall of both angels and man, and also articulates Edgar's desire to do the will of God. It additionally explains why Edgar made the change from secular clerics to Benedictine monks, and references the relationship between the king and the abbey as a cycle of protection from spiritual and physical threats. There are an unknown number of missing leaves from the manuscript, the contents of which can merely be speculated.  Style  Although the use of gold lettering was uncommon in England, every page of the New Minster Charter is written in gold, making it one of a kind. The insular style of lettering is present in the charter, which is written mainly in round Style I Anglo-Caroline script, with large capital letters marking the beginning of different sections of text. Aside from these stylized letters, the majority of the written pages have no other type of illumination. The only true exceptions are found near the beginning of the charter. One page presents the name of King Edgar, with blue wash and gold border. The king's name, presented as 'Eadgar rex', is written in square capitals, with the remainder of the page written in uncials. The facing page contains a large chi-rho (also referred to as a chrismon) decorated in green and gold, and also framed in gold. The text of the page is written entirely in square capitals. preceding these pages is an elaborate frontispiece, the only fully illuminated page of the charter. Also noteworthy are the crosses adorning the witness list, some filled with gold and others merely outlined in brown or red. The significance of the different style of crosses is speculated to correlate somehow to the importance of each witness, but is not entirely known. Another stylistic feature that was unusual for its time is the presence of ten rhyming sentences of prose in chapter II.  Frontispiece  The frontispiece of the New Minster Charter depicts King Edgar, situated between the virgin Mary and Saint Peter, presenting the very charter the image adorns to Christ for blessing. Although Edgar appears to be kneeling, the use of gold on his feet and the edge of his cloak may have been applied with the intention of having the king standing and facing forward. The use of a rare purple tone associates the piece with imperial Byzantium, and the image reflects, in part, the royal Carolingian manuscript style of pieces such as the Prayer Book of Charles the Bald. However, it more specifically displays the trademarks of the Winchester style of the tenth century with its wide use of gold as well as the presence of a border of wild acanthus leaves. The New Minster Charter is the first datable manuscript in the Winchester style although the Benedictional of St. √Üthelwold is a more well-known example from the 10th century.

Background Journalist Ahmet S. Yayla stated that the operation by Turkey may have been carried out to relocate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda elements from Idlib in light of the demilitarization agreement between Russia and Turkey. Salih Muslim, the former co-chairman of the Democratic Union Party, stated that Russia and Turkey were plotting to send jihadists to fight against the YPG as part of the agreement. On 30 October 2018, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said to a public gathering prior to the operation, \\"The plan is to remove the YPG, collect their heavy weaponry and finally allow the real Manbij people to be in full control of their city.\\" Clashes Locations of clashes marked within hatched circles The Turkish military reported that four Kurdish militiamen were killed and another six were injured in the shelling of YPG positions. The Syrian Democratic Forces states that the attack had temporarily halted operations against ISIL near the Iraqi border. The Syrian Democratic Forces also stated that Turkish strikes were not limited to Kobani, but surrounding areas along the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border held by Rojava. On 30 October 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan vowed to clear the Eastern Euphrates region of Kurdish militias, while on 29 October Turkish forces had targeted YPG positions along the Euphrates river. In response to the attack, the SDF redeployed multiple units from the Deir Ez Zor region to confront the Turkish forces. In retaliation, the YPG stated that it destroyed a Turkish vehicle and released a video of the attack;https://twitter.com/defenseunits/status/1057598043598606336?s=21 however, the statement has not been acknowledged by the Turkish government. A Turkish military vehicle fired at the border station in the town of Tell Abyad, leaving one dead from the SDF's Self-Defense Forces. With the US holding positive relations with both Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces, an American military delegation reportedly arrived in Tell Abyad to attempt to mediate between the two parties to attempt to resolve the conflict. On 1 November 2018, the Turkish military targeted Kobani with helicopters as well as howitzers in preparation for an offensive and coordinated plans for an offensive with allied opposition groups based in Afrin. Clashes continued with sporadic shelling and on 6 November Turkey targeted the town of Ras al-Ayn, a YPG supply point. Aftermath On 21 November, United States Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced the U.S. will set up new observation posts along the Turkish border in northern Syria in order to reduce similar incidences between Turkish forces and Kurdish militants in the region. The endeavor is seen as a way of easing tensions between the two NATO allies and doesn't require additional U.S. troops to be deployed to Syria. The move is controversial due to U.S. lawmakers voicing concerns over mission creep in Syria in recent weeks and months. A total of three observation posts were to be set up in Tal Abyad and two in Kobani. The first Tal Abyad post was completed on 27 November. Three total observation posts were established by 12 December. \\"The positions were clearly marked and any force attacking them would definitely know they are attacking the United States\\", said a US official. On 12 December 2018, the Turkish government announced it would begin operations against Rojava \\"in a few days\\" in an apparent rebuke of US efforts at ensuring Turkish border security in the area. In response, the Pentagon said that any unilateral military action taken in northern Syria, where US forces are operating, would be \\"unacceptable.\\" However, several days later the US announced the withdrawal of their troops from Syria, after which Turkey postponed the planned attack. On 25 December, the SDF handed over the town of Arima west of Manbij to troops of the Syrian government. Through 27-28 December, the Manbij Military Council had invited Syrian troops to enter Manbij in order to ward off a future Turkish advance. Syrian forces gradually deployed to the surrounding countryside as American troops continued to patrol inside the city and along the contact lines with the Syrian National Army, whose units continued to deploy and mobilize along the Manbij frontier. Following criticism of the planned withdrawal of their troops, on 6 January the US imposed the security of their Kurdish-led allies as a condition for the withdrawal.

Education and career Eberlin is the daughter of Marcos Nogueira Eberlin, a Brazilian chemist at the University of Campinas. She was born in Campinas, and was a student at the University of Campinas herself; she earned her bachelor's degree there in 2007. During her undergraduate program, she did summer research in chemistry at Purdue University, where her father also had research ties. She continued at Purdue for her doctorate, and completed it in 2012; her dissertation, Developments in ambient mass spectrometry imaging and its applications in biomedical research and cancer diagnosis, was supervised by R. Graham Cooks. After postdoctoral research at Stanford University with Richard Zare, she joined the chemistry faculty at the University of Texas at Austin in 2012. Research In her research, she developed a pen-like device, called the \\"MasSpec Pen\\" or \\"The Cancer Pen\\", that she claims can detect cancerous tissue by touching it during surgery, freezing and slicing it, and examining the slices under a microscope. The pen allows surgeons to achieve a better understanding of which tissues are deemed harmful and should be removed. As a co-principal investigator, at the University of Texas at Austin, Eberlin has developed a way to detect thyroid cancer, in hours, without surgery. This test uses the same technique as her ‚ÄúMasSpecPen‚Äù, mass spectroscopy. It is two-thirds more accurate than the test already in use, fine-needle aspiration. As well as her work on cancer diagnosis, Eberlin has also worked with Cooks and her father on the use of mass spectrometry to quickly detect counterfeit money. Eberlin is concerned about the representation of women and diversity in science. In interviews, she has stressed the importance of women in higher levels of academia as well as leadership. Recognition Eberlin was named a Forbes \\"30 Under 30\\" in 2015. She won the Marion Milligan Mason Award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2017. The award is given every two years to promising young female researchers in chemistry. She won a MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T.

Additionally, she is the director of the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW). She has made several breakthroughs in the captive breeding of Sumatran rhinoceroses, a critically endangered species with fewer than 300 left. Early life Terri Roth grew up on a small farm in California; she stated that even from a young age, she enjoyed playing with snakes, toads, and lizards, \\"whatever I could catch.\\" She attended the University of California, Davis, initially majoring in genetics but then switching emphasis to focus on reproductive physiology. She received both her bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of California. She then attended Louisiana State University, earning a PhD in animal reproductive physiology with a minor in immunology. She was then a postdoc at the National Zoo. Work =Rhinoceroses= Terri Roth has worked with rhinoceroses since 1995. In 1996, she joined CREW. Prior to that, she had worked at the National Zoo at its Center for Research and Conservation as a gamete biologist. Roth has been an integral part of the Sumatran rhinoceros captive breeding program. Roth is credited with turning the program around: she began using operant conditioning to train captive Sumatran rhinos at the Cincinnati Zoo to tolerate rectal ultrasounds, which allowed the zoo's scientists to observe changes in the ovaries. Roth was able to determine that Sumatran rhinos are induced ovulators, meaning that the female will not release an egg unless she is around a male. After determining how to induce ovulation, the captive breeding program experienced several more setbacks after the female rhino miscarried multiple times. After another pregnancy, Roth decided to supplement the female's diet with the hormone progesterone to attempt to sustain the pregnancy, which was successful. The first Sumatran rhino born from the captive breeding program was born 13 September 2001. Since all remaining Sumatran rhinos have since been transferred back to their native range, Roth has traveled to Indonesia several times to share the assisted reproductive technology developed at the Cincinnati Zoo with local veterinarians. Her breakthroughs in Sumatran rhino breeding were the subject of a 2007 children's book, Emi and the Rhino Scientist. She has also been a board member of the International Rhino Foundation since 2002. =Other species= Terri Roth has authored or coauthored several papers relating to artificial reproductive technology in animals. Subjects of her research include cheetahs, clouded leopards, and the scimitar oryx. She has also worked with polar bears, including conducting assessments of fertility, artificial insemination, and creating a polar bear sperm bank. Awards and honors In 2004, Terri Roth received the Chevron Texaco Conservation Award for her work with Sumatran rhinos. In 2012, Roth was a nominee for the Indianapolis Prize.

It was until 1781 mostly owned by the intermarried Rosenkrantz and Juul families. The three-winged main building and the three- winged home farm (avlsg√•rden) were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1950. The two-storey main wing is from 1849 and was designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll but some of the other buildings date from the 17th century. Rosendal is now owned by the Hong Kong-based Danish shipping Jebsen family. History =The Rosenkrantz and Juul families= Mette Rosenkrantz The estate was originally called Totterupholm and was created when Ide Munk, the widow of Oluf Rosenkrantz, merged the farms in the village of Totterup into a single manor circa 1560. Oluf Rosenkrantz had been the wealthiest man in the country. Their daughter Mette Rosenkrantz took over the estate after her mother's death in 1586. She had been married first to Steen Rosensparre and then to Peder Oxe but had become a widow for the second time with her second husband's death in 1575. This had left her the wealthiest woman in the country. After her death, in 1588, Totterupholm was endowed to her granddaughter, Jytte Gyldenstierne, who had been married first to Peder Juel of Gjorslev (died 1612) and then Christian Grubbe of Lystrup (died f√∏r 1642). Her son, Peder Grubbe, sold the estate to Edel Rosenkrantz in 1644. She married Knud Ulfeldt who was killed in the Scanian War in 1657. Edel Rosenkrantz died in 1684. One of her daughters, Margrethe Ylfeldt, was married to admiral Niels Juel, who bought out the other hairs. Niels Juel died in 1797. The estate was then passed on to his son-in-law, Niels Krag. His widow, Sophie Krag (Niels Juel's daughter), then owned it until her death in 1731. =Barony of Rosenlund= Niels and Sophie Krag's eldest daughter daughter, Anna Margretha Krag, the widow of Christian Pedersen Juel, married Holger Rosenkrantz in 1731. In 1748, Totterupholm was elevated to a barony under the name Rosenlund. The Barony of Rosenlund could, however, due to its relatively small size, not benefit from the Tax exemptions that normally applied for tenant farms under a barony. Rosenkrantz managed Rosenlund with great skill and increased the quarrying of limestone at Faxe. Prior to his death in 1785, Rosenkrantz had chosen his nephew Iver Rosenkrantz as his heir. He had also granted him permission to sell Rosenlund on condition that he would create a fideikommis for future generations of the family. =Rosendal, 1788‚Äìpresent= Iver Rosenkrantz sold Rosenlund to Haagen Christian Astrup in 1788 on the condition that its name would be changed back to Totterupholm. Haagen Christian Astrup was, how ever, a few months later, granted permission instead to rename it Rosendal. In 1801, Astrup sold Rosendal to Lauridz Moss Hofgaard and Carl Adolph Stampe. In 1803, he sold it to Lauridz Moss Hofgaard. Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e acquired the estate in 1806. His widow, Johanne Henriette Valentine Danneskiold-Sams√∏e, sold Rosendal to their son-in-law Gustav Christian Holck-Winterfeldt in 1837. He constructed a new main building in 1847‚Äì49. Holck-Winterfeldt died on the estate on 22 November 1885. Rosendal was then taken over by his son, Flemming Holck-Winterfeldt. He left Rosendal to his nephew, Helge Ernest Knuth, who had already managed it for his uncle for some time. He modernized the operations. Helge Ernest Knuth died unmarried and without children in 1941. Rosendal was therefore passed on to his brother Flemming Knuth but he already died the following year. He left Rosendal to his nephew, Kjeld Gustav Knuth-Winterfeldt, who ceded it to his son Ditlev Helge Knuth-Winterfeldt in 1980.

Prior to his appointment at the University of Bern, he was employed at the Faculty of Law of Maastricht University (1992-2016), where he was senior lecturer from 1993-2001, and Professor of International economic law from 2001-2016.

Early life Nicholas was born in the 1300s as the son of Nicholas I V√°s√°ri, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1319 to 1320, and an unidentified lady from the Telegdi family, which originated from the gens (clan) Csan√°d. Nicholas had three brothers and two sisters.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (V√°s√°ri 1. Rupol√∫jv√°ri) V√°s√°ri's origin is confirmed by a letter of Pope John XXII on 2 July 1320, when called him \\"Nicolao nato dilecti filii nobilis viri Nicolai Comitis Viceducis Transsilvani\\". Former historiographical works incorrectly referred him Monoszl√≥i or Frank√≥i. Nicholas' grandfather was Roland Sz√ºgyi, who possessed Sz√ºgy, N√≥gr√°d County in 1255, but sometimes later moved to Bihar County, where became the owner of V√°s√°ri (present-day a depopulated area). His sons took their surname after the village. Nicholas' maternal uncle was Csan√°d Telegdi, the Archbishop of Esztergom from 1330 to 1349. The influential prelate became Nicholas's mentor and supporter in his ecclesiastical career. When his uncle functioned as provost of V√°rad (present- day Oradea Mare, Romania), V√°s√°ri had an opportunity to study in the local collegiate school. Upon Telegdi's request, V√°s√°ri was appointed a canon of the cathedral chapter of V√°rad by Pope John XXII, issuing the aforementioned papal document on 2 July 1320. When Csan√°d Telegdi was consecrated as Bishop of Eger in January 1323, V√°s√°ri followed his uncle to the diocese. He was made a canon, then archdeacon of Borsova (still referred with this title in 1332). It is possible that V√°s√°ri attended a foreign (presumably Italian) universitas thereafter, as Pope Clement VI referred to him as iuris peritus (\\"learned in the law\\"). His uncle Csan√°d Telegdi became Archbishop of Esztergom in September 1330. He sent his nephew and Benedictine friar Anselm to the papal court of Avignon for his pallium, receiving it on 5 January 1331. When Charles I of Hungary visited his uncle, Robert, in Naples in July 1333, Telegdi and V√°s√°ri were among the dignitaries, who escorted the king. There Charles' second son, Andrew, was betrothed to Robert's granddaughter and eventual successor, Joanna I. V√°s√°ri was made canon of V√°rad again on 2 October 1333. Pope Benedict XII appointed him grand provost of Esztergom on 17 January 1339, becoming effectively his uncle's deputy in the archdiocese. He replaced Charles' illegitimate son, Coloman in that position. Since the late 1330s, V√°s√°ri resided in the royal court and became a faithful confidant of the royal family, even after Louis I of Hungary ascended the Hungarian throne in July 1342. The queen mother, Elizabeth, visited Naples in the summer of 1343 to promote the interests of her son Andrew. Subsequently, he traveled further to Avignon as a member of the Hungarian delegation, led by Vid Vasv√°ri, the Bishop of Nyitra. Pope Clement was the overlord of the Kingdom of Naples; they were only able to persuade him to promise that Andrew would be crowned as Joanna's husband. There, V√°s√°ri also requested the contribution of the pope in personal affairs: he requested the forgiveness of sins for himself and his living relatives, including his mother, for the time of their death; in February 1344, he asked Clement to permit him and his brothers, John, Thomas and Beke, to pilgrimage to the Holy Land with the accompaniment of each 10 persons. V√°s√°ri also requested the pope to grant the right of indulgence to the parish church in their residence V√°s√°ri, dedicated to Martin of Tours. According to the charges, the Hungarian delegation tried to bribe the officers of the papal court in order to a favorable decision, but without the permission of the royal family. This led to the discretization of Vid Vasv√°ri, but it did not affect V√°s√°ri's career, who was described as \\"useful workforce\\" by Louis I in the same time. Prelate Vid Vasv√°ri, the Bishop of Nyitra died in February 1347. Upon Louis' request, V√°s√°ri, who still resided in the papal court, was consecrated as his successor by Pope Clement on 23 May 1347. Louis I launched his first Neapolitan campaign in the same year. The king sent small expeditions one after one to Italy at the beginning of his war against Joanna; his first troops departed under the command of Nicholas V√°s√°ri, who went ahead to L'Aquila. V√°s√°ri cooperated with Hungarian lord Nicholas Kont in the upcoming months, they successfully persuaded several nobles in the countryside around L'Aquila to support Louis' efforts against his sister-in- law. Returning home for a brief time, V√°s√°ri reported on the new allies and joined the Hungarian royal army, which entered the Kingdom of Naples on 24 December at the city, which had yielded to Louis. After Louis adopted the traditional titles of the kings of Naples, V√°s√°ri again traveled to the papal court in February 1349, alongside George Bebek, to gain the support and confirmation of Pope Clement. There V√°s√°ri expressed his intention to visit the Holy Sepulchre with twelve persons. Meanwhile, Nicholas V√°s√°ri was nominated to the position of Bishop of Zagreb on 26 March 1349. A single charter issued on 2 September mentioned him in this capacity, but the episcopal see became vacant again by December, because V√°s√°ri was elected Archbishop of Kalocsa during that time. He was still styled as archbishop- elect on 11 January 1350, when he was transferred to the archiepiscopal see of Esztergom, succeeding his uncle, Csan√°d Telegdi, who died in the second half of the previous year. 19th-century historiographical works, including Antal P√≥r's studies, claimed that V√°s√°ri simultaneously held the office of chancellor in the royal court during his archiepiscopate. Thus P√≥r connected that unnamed Hungarian chancellor to the person of V√°r√°si, who led diplomatic missions to the Italian peninsula, including Padua in 1356, according to Italian chronicles. Later historians, for instance Imre Szentp√©tery and Bern√°t L. Kumorovitz refused P√≥r's allegation. V√°s√°ri held an ecclesiastical synod in Esztergom in 1353. He participated in Louis' military campaign against Serbia in the next year, when Hungarian troops invaded the empire, forcing Stefan Du≈°an to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. He was one of the key draftsmen of the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358, in which the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and Durazzo in favor of Louis. V√°s√°ri was last referred as a living person on 26 May. He died by 23 August. Codices His two legal codices (Bonifacius papa VIII. Liber sextus Decretalium and Clemens papa V. Constitutiones), which represent the same art style of Bolognese trecento as the Anjou Legendarium, were preserved in the Capitulary Library of the Padua Cathedral. While the completion of the first codex is uncertain, the second one was finished in 1343. Both of them were dedicated to Nicholas, who was still grand provost of Esztergom during that time. He presumably ordered the preparation of two works, when resided on the Italian Peninsula as a member of the Hungarian diplomatic mission. Fellow Hungarian John Uzsai served as rector of the ultramontanes (i.e. foreign students) at the University of Bologna in that year, who maintained liaison with Hungarian prelate and the local painters. The codices were later owned by Jacopo Zeno, the Bishop of Padua in the second half of the 15th century. The coats-of-arms of Pietro Ruiz de Coreglia, protonotary apostolic of Valence also appear in both codices. The Bonifacius papa VIII. Liber sextus Decretalium contains the hagiography Life of Saint Stephen, King of Hungary (this part is missing from the Anjou Legendarium). Its miniatures, which are the earliest chronicle representations of the king, depicts St. Stephen as a saintly and converter monarch (with the insignia of church model), while the later chronicles, for instance, the Illuminated Chronicle, exclusively portray him as founder of the state and warlord. This is also the only known depiction, where Stephen's parents G√©za and Sarolt are shown together. Ornament line between pictures also portrays individually St. Stephen, St. Emeric, St. Ladislaus and possibly St. Gerard or St. Nicholas, in addition to the customer Nicholas V√°s√°ri himself. The second codex,Clemens papa V. Constitutiones is less remarkable from the point of view of art history, it depicts the legend of Catherine of Alexandria in the usual contemporary way.

She was born in West Virginia in 1855 and began teaching at the age of seventeen. Dowd taught for more than three decades before retiring in 1926, having had experience in almost all phases of the work, including district school substitute, evening school, private school, high school, college, and Sunday school. Besides numerous uncollected poems, she published a volume entitled Vacation Verses in 1890. In 1906, she published Our Common Wild Flowers. With her sister, Luella Dowd Smith, she co-authored another book of poetry, Along the Way, in 1938. Dowd was an occasional contributor to papers, and at one time, a regular contributor to the magazine edition of Pasadena News. Early years and education Alice Mary Dowd (or Mary Alice Dowd) was born in Frankford, West Virginia, December 16, 1855 to Emily (n√©e Curtiss) and Almeron (sometimes spelled Almeson) Dowd. Her parents were school-teachers of Puritan descent, their ancestors having landed in New England about the year 1630. In both families were found officers and privates of the Revolutionary army. On her father's side, she was related to the family of Field and the old English family of Dudley. She was the youngest of four children, though only she and her sister Luella survived childhood. Her other siblings were Curtis Field and Emily Virginia. Dowd's early home was among the Berkshires, whence her parents removed to Westfield, Massachusetts, a town noted for its schools. Dowd was a delicate child, and her parents hoped she would reach adulthood. Shy and reserved, at a young age, she showed a great love of nature and a deep appreciation of all natural beauty. Dowd was educated at home and in the public schools of Westfield. She was graduated first rank from the English and classical departments of the high school, taking the two courses simultaneously. In the State Normal School (now Westfield State University, she studied optionals with the prescribed branches, composed a class hymn sung at her graduation, and was the class poet. She took several courses in the Sauveur Summer School of Languages, which included foreign study and travel, and especially fitted herself to give instruction in German. Career After graduation, she was constantly employed as a teacher. For more than a decade she held the position of first assistant in the high school of Stamford, Connecticut. Of scholarly attainments, she helped many young men to prepare for college. She published a volume of verse, Vacation Verses (Buffalo, New York, 1891). In 1904, she left Stamford to take a post as a German teacher at Pomona College, a member of the Claremont Colleges consortium in Los Angeles County. Two years later, she published a text book, Our Common Wild Flowers, which received mixed reviews from critics. Dowd returned east and between 1912 and 1914 taught at Philmont High School in Philmont, New York. She joined the Women's Political Union of New York writing articles in support of women's suffrage. In 1915, she was hired as the assistant principal of Madalin High School in Madalin. She taught German at the high school in Trumansburg from 1918 through 1921, when she went to teach mathematics and history at the high school in Fort Plain. Dowd was hired in 1923 to teach history and mathematics at the Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake High School, where she remained until her retirement in June 1926. For many years, she also taught in Sunday schools. Dowd and her sister Luella, at that time known as Mrs. James W. Smith, left their homes in Hudson, New York upon her retirement and made a tour of western states with plans to permanently settle in California; however, they returned to Hudson and for several years lived there and wintered in Fort Myers, Florida. The sisters co- authored a book of verses, Along the Way in 1938. Personal life Dowd was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and an associate member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She enjoyed bicycle riding and photography. In religion, Dowd was a Universalist. She survived her sister, Luella, who died July 7, 1941. In early 1943, while living in Hudson, New York, she received a gift of Florida oranges from her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rivenburg. Dowd died at her home in Hudson, on July 2, 1943, at the age of eighty-seven, and is buried at Pine Hill Cemetery, in Westfield.

It is the sequel to the original GunForce and one of the last arcade games, if not the last to be released by the company before ceasing development of video games in the same year, after which a group of employees from the gaming division of Irem would go on to form Nazca Corporation due to being tired of the company's inactivity. In GunForce II, players take control of Max and Lei through multiple stages battling against enemy soldiers and aliens, while rescuing POWs and collecting medals. It is considered a spiritual predecessor to the Metal Slug franchise by SNK, as the first title in the series bears many similarities with this game and it is also sometimes referred to as \\"Metal Slug Zero\\".  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. GunForce II is a run and gun game where players take control of the soldiers Max (P1) and Lei (P2) across five stages that take place in a futuristic post-apocalyptic setting, battling against an army of enemy soldiers, mutants, aliens, among other types of enemies to fight, while rescuing female POWs and collecting medals along the way to increase their score at the end of each level. One of the unique features of the game is that the player's character are dual wielding two weapons at the same time that can be aimed in any given direction and at a slightly different angle each one, while different weapons scattered on the level are available to be collected, but only one can be upgraded as the other one keeps the default weapon. As with the original GunForce, players may find a vehicle scattered in the current level they are in and there are eleven in total to be found through the course of the game, which the players can ride and use against the enemy forces and they tend to vary from level to level, however some of them do not provide any kind of protection for the player against enemy attacks. If the players lose all of their lives, the game is over unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to continue playing. Once all the stages are cleared, players are sent back to the beginning of the first level, as the game loops infinitely.  Development and release  GunForce II shares many similarities with other previously released titles by Irem during the 1990s such as Air Duel, Armed Police Unit Gallop, Undercover Cops, In the Hunt and Superior Soldiers, due to being developed by most of the same personnel that would go on to form Nazca Corporation. The game was first showcased to the public at the 1994 AOU Show. On October 18, 2014, PlatinumGames producer Atsushi Kurooka revealed to a Twitter user that he worked on both GunForce II and Metal Slug (credited as A. Kurooka in the first title of the series), though Kurooka did not specify which role he was involved during the game's development.

The album was released on by Mack Avenue label, her fourth release for the label. References Hank Shteamer of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"The most radical thing a jazz singer could do in 2018 is stick to the basics. One might expect C√©cile McLorin Salvant, who picked up Best Jazz Vocal Album Grammys for each of her past two albums and is riding a wave of mainstream acclaim, to team with a buzzy producer or attempt some other kind of savvy crossover. But on The Window, the wise, virtuosic and subtly subversive 29-year-old singer opts for a setting so stark it can almost seem abstract...\\" Pitchfork review by Stephen M. Deusner noted, \\"Among Salvant‚Äôs most distinguishing artistic traits is how she makes those tonal shifts not just exciting but meaningful. Her craft is undeniable, but built into her craft is the freshness of encountering each tune as though for the first time, figuring it out in the moment from one note to the next. She sings in conversation with every song, its lyrics, and its historical context. Salvant accomplishes that not only by using her voice to comment on lyrics while she delivers them but also by developing a diverse, daring repertoire. On The Window, she sings French cabaret, American showtunes, pop standards, and deep soul and blues cuts.\\" Chris Willman of Variety observed, \\"This one is an album-length vocal/piano duet. But ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù isn‚Äôt a word that will come to mind: Fortner is agreeably insane enough as a player that he doesn‚Äôt just sound like a full band, he sounds like two bands playing at once. And the frontwoman is the very farthest thing from a musical shrinking violet. There are quiet moments in ‚ÄúThe Window,‚Äù but they‚Äôre outweighed by the frantic ones, so if the stripped-down format suggests something polite, think again: McLorin Salvant and her accompanist are majestic and unhinged in equal measure.\\" References Category:2018 albums Category:Jazz albums by American artists Category:Albums recorded at the Village Vanguard ","title":"The Window (C√©cile McLorin Salvant album)"},{"id":"58657986","text":"Gryllotalpa septemdecimchromosomica is a species of mole cricket, in the G. gryllotalpa species group, found in Spain and France: where it may be known as le courtilli√®re Proven√ßale.

Since then, Bryan has become impotent. Cassie goes out for a run, and falls down and injures her ankle. She flags down a passing truck, and an Italian named Federico stops and helps her. He gives her a ride back, and then offers to give them a ride to town the next day. They agree, and spend an awkward ride there the next day. Bryan accuses Cassie of not being able to see how Federico looks at her with lust; disgusted, Cassie leaves to go back to the house. Bryan gets drunk at a bar, Federico joins him. Federico invites two ladies to help Bryan back to a hotel. Bryan and the two ladies end up having sex. Bryan, due to Federico surreptitiously drugging his drink at the bar, has no memory of this and takes a taxi home. It is shown that Federico has secret cameras all over their house, and is secretly watching them. Federico starts showing up when Bryan is not around, and Bryan discovers that Federico is not their neighbor, despite his claims. He threatens to tell Cassie this, Federico threatens him back by telling him that he will tell Cassie that he slept with the two ladies while drunk. Bryan denies this, and eventually tells Cassie that Federico is not who he says he is and to not let him visit. Cassie thinks that Federico is nothing but nice, until Federico cooks them rabbit stew and creepily tells them how much he likes to hunt. Federico sees through his cameras Bryan and Cassie making up and planning to have sex; disgusted, he traps Bryan in the cellar and leaves a note for Cassie to put on a blindfold. Cassie, thinking the note was from Bryan, does so. Federico kisses and gropes her while taping himself doing so, and then, hearing Bryan escaping, sets a video to play it. At the same time, he leaves Bryan's phone near Cassie so she can pick it up. Cassie sees a video of Bryan and the two ladies having sex in the hotel. Upset, she gets dressed and goes to Bryan, and they have a fight, each accusing the other of infidelity. Cassie throws her phone at Bryan, it misses him and hits a mirror, revealing a hidden camera. They realize that Federico is watching them secretly and panic. Federico, watching, sees that they have realized and comes over. They plead to be let go, but Federico attacks Bryan with a knife. They wrestle, and Cassie grabs a cane and hits Federico. Stunned, he falls and she keeps hitting him until he dies. Bryan stops her and says that she will go down for murder but he'll help her. A car pulls up and Bryan tells her to wipe up the blood and he'll hide the body. The visitor turns out to be Eduardo, the owner of the house that Bryan called earlier to complain about Federico. Bryan tells him that everything was all right now, and Eduardo asks to check the house. Eduardo goes to check and Bryan and Cassie panic, wondering what to do. They decide to sneak up on Eduardo and kill him too. Meanwhile, Eduardo goes to check the computers where the cameras were feeding from, revealing himself to be an accomplice of Federico's. He rewinds the tapes and sees Cassie killing Federico, and goes and asks her to confess. She denies it while Bryan sneaks up. Suddenly, Eduardo turns and aims a gun at Bryan, accusing them of murder. They deny it, and Cassie stabs Eduardo. He falls and Bryan hits him with a cane. Then he takes the gun and shoots Eduardo. Later, it is shown Bryan and Cassie burying the bodies and burning them, and then Bryan discovering the computers and taking down the cameras. He doesn't discover all of them, however.

It was first published by Quirk Books on September 19, 2017 in print and ebook. An audiobook release by Blackstone Audio followed on January 9, 2018. In March 2018 Paperbacks from Hell won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Non-Fiction. Valancourt Books later announced that they would re-publish select horror novels as part of a limited series, chosen by Hendrix and Will Errickson. Synopsis Paperbacks from Hell examines paperback horror novels of the 70s and 80s. Hendrix pays attention to trends and events that increased horror's readership and popularity and how the 1988 release of The Silence of the Lambs prompted publishers to shift their focus from horror to thrillers and techno-thrillers. He also cites a glut of product paired with less quality control and an increase in misogynistic content as contributing to this decrease in popularity, noting that it was a variety of factors that led to this. The book also examines authors such as V. C. Andrews and R. L. Stine, as well as cover artwork, which he states publishers knew would be vital to appealing to readers. Also covered are various sub-genres of the horror genre, such as Native American curses or pregnancy sub-genres. Development Hendrix came up with the idea of writing a book on paperback horror novels from the 70s and 80s while purchasing a copy of The Little People by John Christopher, which he describes as \\"a book about a castle in Ireland being turned into a B&B;, and the big problem is Nazi leprechauns in the basement\\". He read an average of four books a day for a three month period and focused his efforts by reading books from the same sub-genre at a time, as this helped him recognize literary tropes and benchmarks specific to those novels. Reception Critical reception for Paperbacks from Hell has been positive, with Locus praising the book for its use of cover art images to back up Hendrix's historical assessment of horror fiction. The AV Club and New York Times also praised the work, with the latter additionally citing the presence of \\"potted histories of authors for whom full histories are likely not forthcoming\\" as a highlight. Tor.com wrote a favorable review, stating \\"It‚Äôs a gorgeous, lurid deep-dive into horror‚Äôs heyday and a must-read for any self-respecting horror fan.\\" Writing for the Washington Post, Ernest Hilbert wrote that the book is \\"as funny as it is engaging, assuring us that whatever else may be said of these paperbacks, most long since disappeared into landfills and yard sale boxes, \\"they will not bore you.\\"\\" References External links * Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction books about horror Category:Books by Grady Hendrix ","title":"Paperbacks from Hell"},{"id":"58658029","text":"Bystry Istok () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Bystroistoksky District of Altai Krai, Russia.

They installed a Canadian maple wooden floor, and opened the building as the Erne Palais Ballroom on Thursday 10 October 1963 with the band the Mighty Avons playing. After a number of years as a successful ballroom, the building was sold in 1979 and became the Palais Community Centre. As a community centre it still played host to local dances.

This task force of military policemen and paratroopers replaced the Tjakrabirawa Regiment after the failed 1965 coup. This task force was liquidated in 1976 and is one of the predecessors of the present day Paspampres.  History  In accordance with Decree PRIN.75/III/1966 dated March 23, 1966 from the office of the Minister/Commander of the Army, Provost Marshal of Military Police Brigadier General (TNI) Sudirgo was appointed to take responsibility for head of state protection. Soon after the transfer, the Provost Marshal issued Decree Kep-011/AIII/1966 dated March 25, 1966, which formally established the Satuan Tugas Polisi Militer Angkatan Darat (Satgas POMAD) under the Military Police Command, and appointed Lieutenant Colonel (CPM) Norman Sasono as its commandant. The Satgas Pomad Para task force operated under the office of the Provost Marshal of Military Police. It consisted of 2 Batalyon Pomad Para (English: Pomad Para Battalions) each as the core units, supported by the Denkav Serbu, 1st Capital Combat Engineers Detachment and the Presidential Band from Kodam V/Jakarta Raya (Army), the Indonesian Air Force's 2nd Battalion, PGT (Pasukan Gerak Tjepat) (English: Rapid Action Force), the Indonesian National Police's Mobile Brigade (BRIMOB), and also from the Army, the 531st Infantry Battalion/Para Raiders which later was replaced with the 519th Infantry Battalion/Para Raiders from Kodam VIII/Brawijaya. The 1st Pomad Para Battalion was located at Jalan Tanah Abang II Central Jakarta, at the former garrison of the Tjakrabirawa Regiment. The 1st Battalion was assigned for protecting and escorting the President and Vice President and their families, and high-ranked foreign head of state-level guests, and guarding Merdeka Utara Palace, Merdeka Selatan Palace, and the President and Vice President's official residences. The 2nd Pomad Para Battalion was located at Ciluer, Bogor, was assigned for guarding Bogor Palace, Cipanas Palace, and as a force multiplier to assist in the functions of the 1st Battalion. Eventually, Kodam V Jaya's Assault Cavalry Squadron was assigned to the task force as the armored element, while the 531st Infantry Battalion was later reassigned to Kodam VIII/Brawijaya. In accordance with the development of the Indonesian Army, the 2nd Pomad Para Battalion was dissolved, leaving the 1st Battalion in active service. On June 10, 1967, General (TNI) Soeharto issued Decree No. KEP-681/VI/1967, transferring control of the task force to the Minister/Commander of the Army from the Provost Marshal.

The development process of the walls can be separated into three stages; the first dates to the first century AD, and the second dates to the reign of the Roman Emperor Aurelian in the third century. The third was an improvement of the Aurelian walls commissioned by emperor Diocletian in the fourth century. The pre-Aurelian walls did not encircle the whole city and were not designed to protect it from conquest, but to provide protection from marauders. The Aurelian and Diocletian walls, although surrounding a smaller area, provided a higher degree of protection as they tightly enclosed the city. History =The first century walls= These walls were constructed in the first century AD, but they did not form a circuit around Palmyra. They did not include protective towers, and not only surrounded the residential areas, but also the gardens of the oasis which allowed Palmyra to exist. Many areas where natural formations provided protection were not fortified; for example, the western side of the city, naturally protected by the slopes of the Palmyrene mountains, was not protected by those walls. These early fortifications provided the city and its garden with protection against the sands of the Syrian Desert, kept the Bedouin bandits outside, and enabled the city to control the commercial activities. =The walls of Aurelian= Overview of the Aurelian wall, called Diocletian wall Well preserved, the walls commonly known as the walls of Diocletian and attributed to his reign, were more likely built by emperor Aurelian following his sack of the city in 273. The notion that Diocletian built those walls stem from the fact that his governor Sossianus Hierocles built the principia (headquarter of a Roman fort) of Palmyra. However, epigraphic and archaeological evidence suggest that Aurelian stationed the Legio I Illyricorum in the city, and it is implausible that the emperor left the city without protection. The walls of Sossianus Hierocles‚Äô structures are clearly attached to the city‚Äôs walls and were not an original part of them; hence, the traditionally called ‚ÄúDiocletian walls‚Äù date to an era earlier than that emperor‚Äôs reign. The Aurelian walls left the southern parts of the city outside their limits. They encircled the area which they were meant to protect and included square towers. =The improvements of Diocletian= U-shaped towers, of different materials and construction techniques, can be attributed to the reign of Diocletian. Earlier twentieth century historians, such as Henri Seyrig and Denis Van Berchem, attributed those towers to the reign of emperor Justinian in the sixth century, based on the writings of the historian Procopius, who stated that Justinian strengthened the city‚Äôs defences. However, the majority of other Roman U-shaped towers in the region date to the fourth century. Comparative analysis of the Palmyrene U-shaped towers and similar structures from the region that are firmly dated to the fourth century suggests strongly that those defences are the work of Diocletian rather than Justinian. The statement of Procopius might be an exaggeration; this does not mean that Justinian did not restore the city‚Äôs walls, but it does not indicate the construction of new ramparts.

She advocates for visibility of people of color in the cosmetic industry. She has partnered with Anastasia Beverly Hills, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Too Faced, Sephora and Sigma Beauty.  Early career  Jackie Aina was born to an African- American mother and a Nigerian father of Yoruba descent. After two years of college, Aina joined the United States Army Reserve. While she was stationed in Hawaii, she found that she had a knack as a makeup artist and was hired by MAC Cosmetics. According to Entrepreneur, Aina \\"kept getting told at makeup counters that the trends she wanted to try wouldn't work for her complexion\\", and so she started creating videos \\"about the products and looks she loved that could work for anyone\\".  Advocacy  As a champion for diversity within the makeup industry, Aina argues that people of color are poorly represented and often ignored in the beauty industry, and has criticized makeup shade ranges for not being inclusive. She has continuously pointed out the lack of darker shade ranges for foundations within lines. She told Bustle in 2018, \\"We all come from so many different backgrounds and we also come in different shades and varieties, and what may be something that I'd be willing to overlook may not be the case for someone else.\\" In addition to foundation shades, Aina said that eye shadow, blush and lipstick colors aren't universal for skin tones. While Aina's criticism of cosmetics companies has compromised relations that she had with several of them, she asserts that her intention is never to disparage them. Several cosmetics companies accepted her criticism, which led to successful partnerships between them and Aina. Aina disapproved of people who claim that they \\"don't see color\\", saying that they ignore racial issues and discourage her from discussing them. In a YouTube video demonstration, she did an ordinary makeup tutorial in black-and-white, and subsequently revealed that she had put on makeup of the wrong color. After IT Cosmetics co-founder and CEO Jamie Kern Lima criticized the beauty industry for non-inclusive and unrealistic depictions of women in advertising, Aina, who had previously criticized IT Cosmetics, confronted her and the rest of the industry about excluding people of color and accepting critiques from a white woman.  Collaborations  In July 2016, Aina teamed up with e.l.f. Cosmetics to create an eye shadow palette. Bustle reported that the palette \\"includes five jewel-tone and metallic shades with both shimmery and matte finishes\\" and described the colors as \\"nude-ish mauve, copper taupe, dark burgundy, glistening gold, [and] deep teal\\". This would be the first of Aina's collaborations to sell out within a short time frame. In March 2017, Sigma Beauty released a set of five \\" Must Have\\" brushes created by Aina. In December 2017, Aina announced that she would launch two rose gold powder highlighters, La Bronze and La Peach, with Artist Couture. A known champion for dark-skinned women and men, Aina expressed her opinion that a foundation product by cosmetics brand Too Faced did not feature enough shades, Too Faced announced a collaboration with her to expand the shade range of its Born This Way foundation. By June 2018, the shade range had been expanded from 24 to 35 shades. Nine of the eleven new shades were formulated by Aina, where several had sold out. She said that she listened to perspectives of her online followers and other influencers of color. Aina said that the collaboration wasn't a result of the effect that Fenty Beauty had on the cosmetic industry after it launched a foundation in 40 shades in 2017, and that she and Too Faced had not known about it. She also said that the brand had reached out to her in efforts to diversify their products long before she had such a large online following. Aina told Bustle in 2018 that she would create a cosmetics line by 2019. In August 2019, Aina released an eyeshadow palette in collaboration with Anastasia Beverly Hills. On the included shades, Aina said, \\"the palette is for everyone but my priority was making sure I chose shades that would specifically work for dark and deep-dark complexions.\\"  Forvr Mood  On July 13, 2020, Aina announced the release of her home goods line, Forvr Mood, which will sell candles, skin-care products, and fragrances.  Awards  At the 49th NAACP Image Awards on January 15, 2018, Aina won the NAACP Image Award for \\"YouTuber of the Year\\". The NAACP introduced the award category in partnership with Google, in 2018.

It prevents a chemical reaction between lead arsenate and lime sulphur. When used to make mold cores from sand, it results in a very hard surface after baking, however the sand can absorb moisture if the core is not used soon after being prepared. Use of Goulac allows the cores to be baked at a lower temperature compared to other types of binders. Glutrin was used in road paving in the early 20th century.

In 1790, with the impact of French Revolution still uncertain and Emperor Joseph II's campaign against monastic establishments under way, Father Charles Neale, the nuns' Maryland-born chaplain, offered Mathews farmland in Port Tobacco, Maryland, where she could build a convent. The new residence was dedicated on October 15, 1790. A convent for contemplatives, it was the first convent for Catholic women established in the United States.

It features both released and unreleased material, spanning from 1985 to 2010. Background and release Masin self-released the album Wind on his own The Bear on the Moon label in 1986, to very little acclaim or popularity. After the release of the album The Wind Collector in 1991, Masin stopped making music following disappointment with the music scene. Wind later became a sought-after record by crate diggers. Jamie Tiller of the reissue label Music from Memory discovered Masin's 1986 album Wind while researching Italian electronic music. Tiller got in contact with Masin and received \\"some 80 tracks\\", which spanned from the early 80s until recently. Tiller, along with label co-founders Abel Nagengast and Tako Reyenga, spent \\"literally months\\" compiling the album from the archival material. The release of the compilation resulted in a resurgence of Masin's career, which had been stagnant for most of the '90s and '00s. Following the release, Masin started touring internationally and releasing new music after increased interest in his work. The compilation was later released on CD with six additional tracks; one from Wind and the rest unreleased. Reception Paul Simpson of AllMusic gave the album 3¬Ω stars.

History Northern Tool was founded by Don Kotula when he began selling log splitters out of his garage. He originally worked in heavy equipment sales at Ziegler, but left when the business began slumping during the 1981-82 recession. In addition to log splitters, Kotula sold cylinders, valves, and hydraulics with his family members assisting in the sales and order fulfillment. The company's first brick and mortar store was opened in Burnsville, Minnesota in 1981. Northern Tool began its own manufacturing business in 1991 with the launch of its NorthStar brand. It manufactured tools such as log splitters, generators, pressure washers, and air compressors. NorthStar brand makes up for 20 percent of Northern Tool's product line. The company launched a website and mail order catalogue in 2008 called Kotula's, named after the founder. In December 2017, Northern Tool opened its 100th store and reached $1 billion in sales. Subsidiaries In addition to tool sales and manufacturing, Northern Tool owns The Golf Warehouse and The Sportsman's Guide. =The Golf Warehouse / The Sportsman's Guide= Northern Tool purchased both The Golf Warehouse and The Sportsman's Guide from Redcats in 2012. The operation of both companies were combined, but continue to operate as standalone online retailers.

He worked in a wide variety of jobs before joining the staff of The Gentlewoman newspaper. He worked in its publishing, advertising and editorial departments, before moving into engineering. During the First World War he was a conscientious objector, an absolutist, and imprisoned from June 1917 to October 1918.https://search.livesofthefirstworldwar.org/record?id=gbm%2fconsobj%2f6298 Stamp joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and became a close friend of Ramsay MacDonald, serving as his election agent. At the 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections, he stood for the Labour Party in Winchester, taking second place on each occasion, but not coming close to election. He opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the Labour Party in 1931, and joined Frank Wise's National ILP Affiliation Committee, which soon became part of the Socialist League. In 1934, Stamp was elected to the London County Council (LCC) representing Bethnal Green South West, and he thereafter devoted most of his time to the body, becoming an alderman, and still later serving as a representative of Islington South West. At the 1945 United Kingdom general election he stood for Stockport, but was again unsuccessful. On the LCC, Stamp sat on most committees at some time, but he made his greatest impact as chair of the Town Planning Committee; during this period, the council signed many town expansion agreements. In 1963, he was elected as chair of the LCC, but after a few months, leader of the opposition Percy Rugg was passed potentially incriminating letters dating from Stamp's time on the Town Planning Committee. Stamp denied that the letters showed any improper behaviour, but he resigned from the council and retired from politics. The Director of Public Prosecutions conducted an investigation, and concluded that Stamp was innocent of any criminal activity. Stamp was described by The Observer as a \\"debonair\\" figure, and he usually wore a carnation buttonhole.

Early life  Queen Supayagyi next to Queen Supayalat and King Thibaw Supayagyi, born in 1854 as Hteiksu Phayagyi (), was the eldest of three daughters between King Mindon and Hsinbyumashin. She was a full-blooded sister of Supayalat and Supayagalay. She received the appanage of Mong Nawng and was hence known as the Princess of Mong Nawng, with the royal title Susƒ´riratanama·πÖgaladevƒ´.  Coronation  The ambitious Hsinbyumashin, after placing Thibaw on the throne, offered her oldest daughter Hteik Supayagyi, to be his queen. During the royal aggamahesi coronation, Supayalat pushed in next to her sister to be anointed queen at the same time, breaking ancient custom. Her sister's marriage was never consummated, and Supayalat was said to have forced monogamy on a Burmese king for the first and the last time in history, even though Thibaw also subsequently married her youngest sister Hteik Supayalay, Princess of Yamethin.  Exile  The brick palace in Ratnagiri that Supayagyi and the royal family was exiled to The royal family's reign lasted just seven years when Thibaw Min was defeated in the Third Anglo-Burmese War and forced to abdicate by the British in 1885. On 25 November 1885 they were taken away in a covered carriage, leaving Mandalay Palace by the southern gate of the walled city along the streets lined by British soldiers and their wailing subjects, to the River Irrawaddy where a steamboat called Thuriya (Sun) awaited. Supayagyi and the queen mother were sent to Tavoy (now Dawei). She died with buddhist num life on 25 February 1912 in Mingun after her mother, who died in 1900.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The boat was designed in reaction to the deaths of four young sailors in the capsize of a Star on Lake Union in 1927. Geary was determined to design a safer boat for youth sail training. The boat was originally named the 18' Development Class Flattie, but it was usually called simply the Flattie, due to its flat-bottomed hull shape. In 1961, the year after the designer's death, the class association renamed the design the Geary 18, in his honor. Production The design was initially built by the Blanchard Boat Company for the Seattle Yacht Club and by members of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club and others, including the Clark Boat Company in the United States. Since then many professional and amateur builders have completed examples of the design. A total of 1500 boats have been built. Design Conceived as a youth boat, the Geary 18's design goals were \\"ease of construction, low cost, safety, speed, smartness, and value in training beginning sailors\\". The resulting boat is a small, unsinkable, recreational keelboat, initially built predominantly of wood, later versions were produced in fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with a full-roach mainsail, a nearly plumb stem a vertical transom, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard keel. It displaces and can accommodate one to four crew members. Flotation bags are installed under the decks to ensure the boat will not sink. The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. Both the centerboard and the rudder can be trimmed fore and aft to optimize the boat‚Äôs performance. As the centerboard is light, the boat relies on its beam to aid stability. The class rules allow the use of a single crew trapeze, but no spinnaker. A whisker pole can be used to hold the jib out downwind instead. The design will plane. The design has been constructed by many different boat-building companies and also by many amateur-builders, so the materials and construction techniques vary considerably. Most earlier boats have straight-sawn frames, with flat hull sides and bottoms, with flat decks, all made from wooden planking. Later wooden boats are mostly built from plywood. Some centerboards have been made from aluminum. Starting in about the 1960s, many of the boats were built using fiberglass for the hull construction, but wooden hulls are still sailed. The 1996 championships in Ashland, Oregon were won by a wooden boat. In more recent years there has been a trend back to new boats being built of plywood, in place of fiberglass. Operational history The first ten boats were built by the Blanchard Boat Company for the Seattle Yacht Club, while another ten boats were amateur-built by members of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club in 1928, forming racing fleets at those clubs. The Blanchard-built boats sold for US$150 when new. Fleets were quickly initiated in Oregon, Lake Arrowhead, California, and Acapulco, Mexico, the latter two by the designer himself. In the 1938 the design was named the official boat of the Sea Scouts. Geary continued to promote the class after the Second World War, stating that he aspired to keep \\"the Flattie class ...as a racing yacht that anyone with little or no boating experience can build and race; to develop faster sailors, not faster boats; to keep the boat in a low- cost bracket, changing the specifications only when a definite saving can be shown.\\" In the 1990s the class was being widely sailed on the North American Pacific coast, with more than 1,500 completed in total. The 1995 championships were held on Mission Bay, at San Diego, California, with 21 boats racing. The 1996 championships were held in Ashland, Oregon with 23 boats competing. The 1997 championships were sailed on Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Boats on display *The Center for Wooden Boats, Seattle, Washington, United States.

It was built from 1804 to 1870 by Lewis Jones and James Vincent. It is also known as Dight's Farm. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous and early colonial occupation= The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. =Dight's Farm/Mountain View= John Dight (1772 - 1837) with his wife Hannah (1781 - 1862) and baby daughter Sarah arrived in the colony on 12 June 1801 as free settlers on board the \\"Earl Cornwallis\\". They received a grant on 31 March 1802 of 155 acres from Governor King at Mulgrave Place - later called Richmond - the grant to be known as \\"Durham Bowes\\". This grant was on the eastern bank of the Hawkesbury River, downhill and slightly north of the location of the later Dight's Farm/ today's Mountain View. Richard Rouse and his sons (of Rouse Hill House and farm) had various grants on the opposite, western bank of the Hawkesbury River. Surveyor James Meehan laid out the grants in the area. Various disputes arose among grantees about access to the nearby towns. Settlers fenced off access routes across their grants. The Hawkesbury River was in flood three times during 1806 causing the destruction of the Dight's four roomed brick dwelling on their lowlands grant. This induced them to purchase 9 acres on the highlands to safely accommodate their growing family. It was on the south-west corner of Edward Luttrell's 1804 grant and became known as Dight's Hill. The farm was advertised to be let in 1808 when John Dight was Superintendent of Carpenters at the Commissariat Store in Parramatta during Richard Rouse's absence from that position. In 1810, Governor Lachlan Macquarie established the five Macquarie Towns in the Hawkesbury region, including Richmond. The settlement thus became more permanent, with streets, a town square and public buildings. In March 1812 John Dight contracted with Lewis Jones - who together with carpenter James Vincent were described in the Bigge report of 1820 as \\"two of the best builders in this part of the colony\\" to erect a dwelling house of two storeys for the sum of twenty six pounds. This building was next to, but independent of the original dwelling and consisted of one room on each storey. The contract was witnessed by Margaret Catchpole, the esteemed convict nurse. Governor Macquarie wrote to Earl Bathurst in 1817 and expressed indignation at the obstinacy of the Hawkesbury settlers, continuing to reside on lands subject to flooding. In 1819 Richmond's populace petitioned Macquarie with many disputes over access to the towns (around other grants). Surveyor James Meehan's recommendations were disregarded. William Cox Jnr. of Hobartville fenced off the road to Dight's Farm, meaning that John Dight had to go the long way around his land daily to reach his lowland farm.R.Sharpe, 1/2010 John and Hannah Dight's family increased to thirteen children with the birth of their eighth daughter Sophia in November 1823. Two years later Elizabeth their second daughter married Hamilton Hume the explorer, following his return from discovering a route to Port Phillip. During the 1820s and 1830s the sons of John and Hannah Dight were establishing themselves as pastoral pioneers in areas they had helped discover - Hunter River, Liverpool Plains, Namoi River and Macintyre River, Hume (Murray) River and the Yarra River, where John the younger and his brother Charles built the river's first (water-powered) flour mill at what became known as Dights Falls. The building remains little-altered from the 1870s when the link section was constructed, the south-west and south-east elevations were stucco-ed and the shingle roof was replaced with corrugated iron. A 1920s photograph from the Dight family showed the homestead complex in a fairly open grassed landscape with few trees. In the 1970s an internal brick wall was removed in the original cottage and a brick wall on the north-east elevation was rebuilt. 9 acres of the former highland farm was subdivided, alienating the surviving outbuildings and landscape features. By 1978 the barn, hayshed, coach house, servants' sheds and horse mill were all demolished.  Description  Mountain View is a well sited homestead on Dight's Hill overlooking the Richmond Lowlands and is an integral part of the historic escarpment. The nine acre highland farm was subdivided in the 1970s alienating the surviving outbuildings and landscape features. The barn, hayshed, coach house, servants sheds and horse mill were all demolished by 1978. =Homestead= The building is an early Colonial Georgian homestead, comprising several elements. The original two-roomed sandstock brick cottage with mud/shell mortar and plaster has a corrugated iron roof, central chimney and original joinery and dates from . The original kitchen with a large fireplace and a bread oven was added pre 1812. This single storey section has brick floors covered by concrete. The 1812 and 1820s two storey additions are sandstock brick with mud/shell mortar and plaster with a hipped corrugated iron roof and an asymmetrical single-storey verandah with iron roof supported by tapered hardwood octagonal columns over Marulan stone flagging. Internal joinery includes a built -in cupboard (1812), cedar chimney pieces and hardwood flooring with handmade nails survive. Unusual features include a mock chimney on the west end to achieve Georgian symmetry and nine pane sliding sash windows in the upper storey. It survives remarkably intact. =Garden= Post and rail fence A post and rail fence still bounds the front of the property facing Inall's Lane. A low-key driveway leads into the eastern side of the front garden to an open carport beside the main homestead and beside the southern end of the original cottage. A pedestrian path winds from a separate central southern gate to the front door. The front garden is now a semi-woodland planted partly to screen development south of Inalls Lane and adjacent on both sides - with trees including silver elm (Ulmus minor 'Variegata'), various English oaks (Quercus robur), Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), silky oak (Grevillea robusta), pepper(corn) tree (Schinus molle), desert ash (Fraxinus oxycarpa), pin oak (Quercus palustris), crab apple (Malus sp./cv.), crepe myrtles (Lagerstroemia indica), Japanese maple (Acer palmatum), paperbark (Melaleuca sp.) and the scented flowering shrub Viburnum carlesii. The eastern side of the garden is notable for a number of tall trees providing screening and privacy to the neighbours, including smooth barked/coastal apple/Sydney red gum (Angophora costata), pepper(corn) tree, white cedar (Melia azedarach var.australasica), white barked gums (possibly Eucalyptus rossii/Corymbia citriodora), a plane tree to the rear (Platanus √ó acerifolia), paperbark and an Illawarra plum/brown pine (Podocarpus elatus). The western side of the garden includes Chinese elm trees, a manna /flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus), Queensland black bean (Castanospermum australe), tsugi/Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), forest oaks (Allocasuarina torulosa), lily pilly (Syzygium australe), silky oaks. The rear (northern) garden has open areas of grass fringed and spotted with trees, some large and mature, for privacy. A former central hedge running north-south is now overgrown with climbers (Pandorea species and others). Trees include jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), pepper(corn)s, box elder (Acer negundo), southern nettle (Celtis australis), mulberry (Morus sp.), white cedars, holly (Ilex aquifolium), variegated laurustinus (Viburnum tinus 'Variegata'). = Modifications and dates = * two roomed sandstock brick cottage with mud-/shell mortar and plaster and shingle roof. * 1812 and 1820s two storey additions in sandstock brick with shingle roof. * 1812 built-in cupboard, chimney pieces and hardwood flooring all survive * 1870s: Brick two storey link section between original cottage and 1812 addition.

It is a substantially intact example of early building materials and techniques. It is a harmonious feature of the landscape which provides evidence of having set the example to establish the safe accommodation on the highlands out of reach of the flood waters of the Hawkesbury River. Documentary records and physical evidence support the educational and research potential of Dights Hill and the archaeological resource of an early farm complex. Well documented associations with exploration, pastoralism and prominent historical figures have attracted both local and overseas visitors with an interest in early Australian history to the site. These outstanding factors contribute to the exceptionally high significance of this item of National heritage. Mountain View was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The item is historically significant because John Dight was one of the early Colony's most respected free settlers. The establishment of his farm complex on the highlands pre-dated Governor Macquaries edict of 1810 which required the settlers to provide flood free accommodation for themselves and their stock etc. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The item is significant because of its association with John Dight, one of the colony's most respected free settlers. Dight's example in relocating his homestead to the high ground above the floodplain had a significant influence on later settlement patterns. Dight was a free settler, and for a time, Superintendent of Carpenters at the Commissariat Store in Parramatta during Richard Rouse's absence from that position. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The item is aesthetically significant because of its harmonious relationship with the landscape. Its setting on the floodbank escarpment overlooking the lowland farms is an integral part of an historic landscape. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance is demonstrated in the continuing interest of professionals, students and the general public because of the items association with prominent historic figures and the age of the building. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item is a well documented resource of the building materials and techniques from the beginning of the 19th century together with a well documented social history. The existence of the 1812 building contract between John Dight and Lewis Jones which relates to the intact building is exceptional. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item is an important survivor from the first quarter of the colony.

Winfield worked for the Battersea Vestry and he became a leading figure in the Vestry Employees' Union, working with John Piper to build the branch up to 200 members. However, they became unhappy with the union leadership, and broke away in 1894, forming the Battersea Vestry Employees' Labour Union. In 1900, the Battersea Vestry Employees merged into the London- wide Municipal Employees' Association (MEA), and Winfield was appointed as one of the union's first full-time organisers. Two years later, he worked with Richard Davies and Peter Tevenan, touring the country in order to recruit members outside London. He also became the chair of the union's executive committee. In 1907, general secretary Albin Taylor was dismissed by the committee, and it proposed either Tevenan or Winfield as his replacement. Winfield decided to stand aside, and was instead appointed as secretary of the union's London district. For many years, Winfield was active on Battersea Trades Council, and he served as its president from 1912 until 1917. In 1909, Winfield was elected to Battersea Council on behalf of the Labour Party. He remained on the council for the rest of his life, pioneering a scheme in which 1,000 poor children from the borough were taken on a day out at the seaside. He unsuccessfully contested Battersea South at the 1922, 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections.

She was born Princess Supayagale c. 1821, the daughter of King Bagyidaw and his consort Nanmadaw Me Nu. She was wedded to Mindon Min, the penultimate king, who made her the high-ranking \\"Queen of the Central Palace\\" (). Her full regnal title upon ascending the throne was Sƒ´ripavaratiloka MahƒÅrƒÅjindƒÅdhipati PadumaratanƒÅdevƒ´ (·Äû·ÄÆ·Äõ·Ä≠·Äï·Äù·Äõ·Äê·Ä≠·Äú·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ ·Äô·Äü·Ä¨·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá·Ä≠·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Ä¨·Äì·Ä≠·Äï·Äê·Ä≠ ·Äï·Äí·ÄØ·Äô·Äõ·Äê·Äî·Ä¨·Äí·Ä±·Äù·ÄÆ). On 25 November 1877, she received the title Hsinbyumashin, which translates to \\"mistress of the white elephants,\\" upon receiving a white elephant named Sƒ´rimahƒÅsubhatta from King Mindon. Hsinbyumashin dominated the last days of King Mindon. She orchestrated the massacre of upward of 100 members of the royal family, it was an edict by Hsinbyumashin that ordered almost all possible heirs to the throne be killed, so that her daughter Supayalat and son-in-law Thibaw Min would become queen and king. The ambitious Hsinbyumashin, after placing Thibaw on the throne, offered her oldest daughter Supayagyi, to be his queen. During the royal aggamahesi coronation, Supayalat pushed in next to her sister to be anointed queen at the same time, breaking ancient custom. The female lineage of Hsinphyumashin, her mother Nanmadaw Me Nu, and her daughter Supayalat in the male dominated Burmese monarchy is a very interesting one regarding the end of Independence and the monarchy.yi  Exile  The Konbaung dynasty reign lasted just seven years when Thibaw Min was defeated in the Third Anglo-Burmese War and forced to abdicate by the British in 1885. On 25 November 1885, the royal family were taken away in a covered carriage, leaving Mandalay Palace by the southern gate of the walled city along the streets lined by British soldiers and their wailing subjects, to the River Irrawaddy where a steamboat called Thuriya (Sun) awaited. Hsinbyumashin and her daughter, Supayagyi, were sent to Tavoy (now Dawei). She died in Rangoon, British Burma on 26 February 1900.

He was born in Granada, Spain in the 15th century A.D. and died in T√©touan on an unknown date between 1515 and 1541. Early life in al-Andalus According to different sources, al-Mandri comes from a noble family. Historian Gozalbes Busto believes that his family comes from Bedmar y Garc√≠ez in the region of Jaen. During the Spanish Reconquista, al-Mandri belonged to the side of Boabdil, the last king of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. When the Granada War started in 1482, he was holding the mayoralty of the fortress of Pi√±ar, north east of Granada. According to 16th century Spanish chronicler Luis del M√°rmol Carvajal, al-Mandri was a captain of the troops loyal to Boabdil, a firm defender of the castle of Pi√±ar until 1485 when it succumbed, either abandoned or surrendered,Historians do not agree whether abandoned or surrendered after the siege and conquest of the fortresses of Cambil and Alhabar. Portuguese historian David Lopes says of him that in Spain, \\"...it seems, [he] had played an important role in the struggles with the Christians of the Iberian Peninsula.\\" Portuguese chronicles, those of Bernardo Rodriguez, Dami√£o de G√≥is and Rui de Pina, situate him as a historical figure although the name of Almendarim refers both to him and to his grandson (or nephew), Sidi al-Mandri II. Al-Mandri was married to Fatima, a noblewoman, niece of Aben Comixa and a relative of King Boabdil. When she was sent to celebrate her wedding with him in Tetouan, she was captured by Alonso de C√°rdenas while trying to cross the river Genil. Conducted to Pinos Puente, where the Count of Tendilla awaited her arrest. She was kept in captivity in Alcal√° la Real until she got released by mediation. After the fall of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, he took refuge in the North of Morocco with an objective of avenging the loss of his native city Granada in al-Andalus and waiting for a quick return to the lost kingdom; something that would never happen. As re-founder of Tetouan The city of Tetouan had just suffered major destructions in separate occasions during the 15th century. In 1399, Castilians burned down the city and enslaved its population in retaliation for piracy activities. An attack by the Portuguese, who had already captured Ceuta to the north, followed in 1436. He is considered as the refounder of the city of Tetouan, a city already in ruins after its destruction. It is there where he took refuge with his troops and 400 members of the 32 noble Granadine families in the 1491 fleeing the Christian advance in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. He later wrote to the founder and governor of the neighboring newly founded city of Chefchaouen, Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami asking him to send competent people to build a wall of protection for Tetouan. In exchange he put himself at the service of Ali Ibn Rashid, then lord of northern Morocco, who was in constant struggle with the Portuguese garrisons based in Ceuta. He later found himself facing the tribe of Beni Hozmar who wanted to impede the continuation of the works. To further strengthen and foment unity against the Iberians, al-Mandri married Ali Ibn Rashid's daughter, known as Sayyida al-Hurra. She soon became a de facto vice-governor with her husband entrusting her the reins of power each trip he made outside the city. When the latter died in 1515, the population, who had become accustomed to seeing her exercise power, accepted her as a governor of T√©touan, giving her the title of al-Hurra.

Career  N√∫√±ez was well-known as local radio host for her daily news program \\"Red Noticias\\" with La Perferida Estero station in Pitalito. She also worked for the local Pitalito Channel 6, Naci√≥n TV out of Neiva and La Naci√≥n newspaper. She had received death threats throughout her career, and one of the most notable was in 2015 after she reported on an animal abuse incident. Before her murder, she had posted several controversial reports on her social media accounts including comments from a Catholic bishop on corruption and images of a local gang.  Death  Flor Alba N√∫√±ez Vargas was murdered around noon on September 10, 2015. She was shot in the back of the head while unlocking the door to the radio station she worked at in Pitalito, Colombia. The murder was caught by a surveillance camera. The government offered a reward for information regarding the murder. The reward offered was 55 million peso, which is equivalent to about $18,000. The gunman was identified as Juan Camilo Ortiz, who was arrested on September 26, 2015, in Palmiros. Ortiz was already a known criminal with a history of trouble before the murder of N√∫√±ez. He had been accused of attempted murder before, and he previously served over two years in prison for illegally possessing firearms. He was found guilty on August 11, 2017, and received the sentence of 47 years and 6 months. Jaumeth Albeiro Fl√≥rez (a.k.a. Chory) was identified as the motorcycle driver.  Context  N√∫√±ez was known for her reporting about arrests and drug traffickers. She received threats over some of her coverage, although she never officially reported any threats. According to Fundaci√≥n para la Libertad de Prensa, there are three main speculations as to why N√∫√±ez was murdered. The first speculation involves coverage over a recent gang robbery. N√∫√±ez received death threats for this coverage. The second possible reason for the murder revolves around her local election coverage, which also produced threats. The third reason involves pictures and an interview of men who hanged a dog after it attacked them.  Impact  In 2015, the Foundation for Press Freedom reported an increase in attacks numbering 150, which amounted to the largest number of attacks in 6 years, and over 70 journalists experienced threats. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Flor Alba N√∫√±ez Vargas was the third journalist, along with Luis Carlos Peralta Cuellar and Edgar Quintero, all killed in Colombia in 2015.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, ‚ÄúI condemn the killing of Flor Alba N√∫√±ez Vargas. A free press and a free society go hand in hand, attacks on the one weaken the other, so I urge the authorities to do everything to investigate this crime and bring those responsible for it to justice.‚Äù There had been many previous murders of unprotected journalists who reported about corruption, violence, and drugs. In Colombia, in 2015, after the murder of N√∫√±ez Vargas, there had been 84 filed violations of press freedom with 126 victims. These high numbers made officials call out for and urge the safety of journalists unlike they have previously. Flor Alba Nunez Vargas's death was tragic, but it serves as another step towards protecting journalists in Colombia.

He was among the most powerful political figures in Zhejiang throughout much of his career. In order to maintain and expand his influence over the province, Xia opportunistically played out different Chinese warlord factions against each other. Plotting to gain Zhejiang's independence from the warlord regime of Sun Chuanfang, Xia launched a rebellion in 1926, but was captured and summarily executed.  Biography  = Early life = Born at Qingtian County, Zhejiang, in 1881 or 1882, Xia joined the Tongmenghui and took part in the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1911. Along with his fellow revolutionary Gu Naibin, he planned to burn down the manor of Qing Minister of Communications Sheng Xuanhuai. At some point, Xia joined Zhejiang's provincial military, trained in Japan, and eventually graduated from the Zhejiang Military Academy in Hangzhou. He subsequently joined several officer associations, namely the Wubei Clique, the Kung-huo Tang, and the \\"Ten Brothers\\". Membership in these associations helped him to garner influence and allies in Zhejiang. = Police chief of Zhejiang = Zhejiang (red) in the Republic of China By the time China's first president Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor in 1916, Xia had risen to chief of the provincial and metropolitan police in Zhejiang. Many military and civilian leaders around China were opposed to Yuan's monarchism, resulting in rebellions against the Chinese government that culminated in the National Protection War. Xia sympathized with the republicans, and consequently started to conspire with Tong Baoxuan, commander of the Zhejiang New Army's 2nd Battalion, to overthrow Zhejiang's pro-Yuan provincial government. The two plotted to capture and murder Zhejiang's governor Zhu Rui, but the governor fled on 11 April 1916 before they could carry out their plan. Shortly thereafter, Yuan Shikai died, resulting in the collapse of the monarchist movement. With the end of Yuan's regime, Lu Gongwang was appointed as new military governor of Zhejiang, while Shen Dingyi became president of the province's provincial assembly. Thereafter, however, Zhejiang descended into civil strife between the Wubei Clique led by Xia and a rival association, the Baoding Clique led by governor Lu. As governor, Lu initially had the upper hand in the power struggle, and started to undermine Xia by abolishing the provincial police. Alienating many leading Zhejiang officials through his high-handed policies, Lu finally drove Xia into open opposition when the latter learned that he was supposed to be replaced as metropolitan police chief by Lu's follower Fu Qiyong. It is likely that Xia was extremely opposed to Fu's accession not just because he wanted to maintain his power, but also due to his fear that his misappropriation of funds could be uncovered. By fall 1916, Xia plotted with his fellow officer and \\"Ten Brothers\\" associate, Zhou Fengqi, to overthrow Lu. In case of success, the two planned to share power, with Zhou becoming military and Xia civil governor. Lu learned of the conspiracy, however, and ordered the police chief removed from power. When Fu Qiyong was supposed to be appointed as the next chief on 26 December, Xia's followers struck by seizing and publicly beating Fu during his inauguration. The other policemen did not intervene, leaving Fu humiliated and in no position to succeed Xia. Meanwhile, Hangzhou's police went on strike in support of their old chief, while Xia himself took \\"many\\" chests of money (possibly embezzled funds) from the police headquarters to the local Bank of China. He also ordered the regional newspapers to censor their reports, and tried to bribe Fu and Lu into accepting their deposition. Lu refused, however, and the tensions quickly increased. Neither Lu nor Xia were ready to back down and their followers prepared for open civil war. Though the intervention of assembly president Shen Dingyi prevented bloodshed, the deteriorating political situation in Zhejiang caused the new central government in Beijing to appoint Yang Shande as military governor. Though the officials in the province widely condemned the appointment of a non-native such as Yang as governor, they could not prevent his military-backed accession in January 1917. Xia became the prot√©g√© of Qi Yaoshan (pictured) from 1917 Xia tried to come to good terms with the new provincial government which in turn attempted to reach an understanding with local officials. He won the attention of military governor Yang by having his wife visiting Yang's wife, and also managed to become the prot√©g√© of Qi Yaoshan, the new civil governor. In contrast, his rival Lu left the province and joined the Kuomintang in Guangdong. In the following decade, Zhejiang came to be dominated by the Anhui clique while China was divided among hostile warlords during the so-called Warlord Era. Throughout this time, Xia continued to serve as police chief. After Yang died in 1919, he sided with the Anhui clique against his local rivals, and helped to establish Anhui associate Lu Yongxiang as the new military governor of Zhejiang. By backing Yang and Lu, Xia did not just maintain his own power, but also managed to make himself irreplaceable as middleman between the military governors and the provincial natives. He also became an important figure in the Jin-Qu-Yu-Chu association (JQYC), a lobby group for the interests of Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, and Chuzhou. = Civil governor under Sun Chuanfang = In 1924, Xia and other Zhejiang officials cooperated with Zhili clique leaders Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang to overthrow Lu. They probably believed that the Zhili clique would have a weaker grip on the province than the Anhui clique, thereby strengthening their own position. Sun appointed Xia civil governor of Zhejiang for his cooperation in the takeover. When a Kuomintang-sympathetic rebellion erupted in Ningbo in September 1924 against Xia and his allies, Sun helped them to suppress it. In turn, the Zhejiang officials aided Sun in repelling an invasion by the Anhui clique and its new ally, the Fengtian clique, in 1925. Nevertheless, the warlord had grown wary of the local officials' power, and used this conflict to keep them in check. Xia was required to act as Sun's vice-commander during the fighting, removing him from his power base, while the warlord placed a garrison loyal to himself in Hangzhou. Sun Chuanfang, Xia's superior from 1924 Unhappy with this development, Xia and the local gentry rallied against Sun, declared their province's autonomy and adopted a new constitution. Sun answered by sending his subordinate Lu Xiangting to Hangzhou on 25 January 1926, appointing him as Zhejiang's \\"military commander-in-chief\\" (de facto military governor), and positioning his army at routes into the province. The secession was thus quelled before it could start. Knowing that further resistance was futile, Xia made a political turnaround. He welcomed Lu upon his arrival, threw an \\"impressive\\" party for him, and even declared an official holiday in his honor, ensuring that the newly-appointed military commander-in-chief accepted Xia's submission and kept him in his position. Despite this, Xia continued to plot against Sun, knowing that the warlord's rule was widely resented in Zhejiang. As result, Xia started to build up police and security forces for a rebellion; his private army grew to at least 5,000 by 1925. The opportunity for an uprising came in late 1926. Poor harvests in 1925‚Äì26 had resulted in an economic crisis in Zhejiang which was exacerbated by Sun's taxes, so that the province's population was restive. Furthermore, the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army (NRA) under Zhejiang native Chiang Kai-shek had launched the Northern Expedition to reunify China. After the NRA invaded Sun's territories, Xia was contacted by Kuomintang officials from Zhejiang. Secret negotiations began, which resulted in Xia reaching an agreement with Chiang Kai-shek. The civil governor promised to defect if the NRA managed to defeat Wu Peifu at Wuchang (which they did on 10 October), while regional Kuomintang representative Niu Yongjian assured him that an uprising would break out in Shanghai to support him against Sun. Though Xia continued to pretend to be neutral during summer 1926, he began to prepare his bid for autonomy from Sun. He cut the railway from Zhejiang to Shanghai (Sun's center of power) and dispersed the garrison of Hangzhou to weaken Sun's grip on the province. = Rebellion and death = On 16 October, Xia publicly declared independence for Zhejiang with the support of several local commanders and civilian officials, and called upon all soldiers from Zhejiang to return to their home. Many followed this call, and he quickly amassed an army of about 10,000 fighters. These troops were not well trained or armed. Xia was also appointed \\"provisional chairman\\" of the province by the Kuomintang and commander of the 18th Corps by the NRA. Following his defection, Xia launched an attack on Sun-controlled Shanghai with 2,500 troops. Even though Sun had detected Xia's plans days earlier, he had few troops to spare in the defense of Shanghai and thus ordered the railway to the city from Hangzhou torn up. By late 17 October, Xia's force was just 5 kilometres of the city. At this point, Sun received reinforcements to defend the city, whereupon Xia's advance was blocked. Nevertheless, the promised uprising in Shanghai failed to materialize, as the local Communist Party and Kuomintang leaders still debated about the course and chances of success for a rebellion in the city. Though several Communists urged action, Niu Yongjian refused, reasoning that the Shanghai insurgents lacked sufficient arms. Xia was consequently forced to retreat, and attempted to salvage the situation before his former superior launched a counter-attack. He sent a message to Sun's subordinates, claiming that he had been deceived into defecting to the Kuomintang, whereupon the warlord pretended to accept this explanation. In truth, however, Sun's army marched into Zhejiang on 20 October and ambushed the rebel force near Jiaxing during the night. Though Xia managed to escape, 6,000 of his barely trained soldiers were captured after a short battle. Hundreds of them were then machine-gunned for taking part in the rebellion. Sun's army captured Jiaxing on 21st and Hangzhou on 23rd, marking Xia's final defeat. The warlord soldiers were let loose on Xia's provisional capital, looting the city while carrying out a \\"terrible massacre\\" among its civilian population. Attempting to flee into Zhejiang's hills in his car, Xia was captured soon after, and promptly shot on the streets of a nearby town. His severed head was then brought to Nanjing and put on a spike as warning to others. Sun appointed Chen Yi as new governor of Zhejiang, but Chen promptly declared independence as well, this time with more success. Meanwhile, Niu Yongjian had ordered the launch of the rebellion in Shanghai on 23 October. It remains unknown why the Shanghai uprising began on the same day when their potential ally Xia was defeated, though it has been speculated that the insurgent leadership was misinformed about the outcome of the fighting in Zhejiang and believed that Xia had won.

A Republican, he served most of the Douglas community area, including much of the African-American neighborhood of Bronzeville. He was a prominent ally of mayor William Hale Thompson, and served as his floor leader throughout the 1920s. Early life Born on April 17, 1870, in Petersburg, Virginia, Anderson moved to Washington, D.C., in 1889 to work in journalism as an exchange reader, and journalist. At some point he was employed by the newspaperman Major Moses P. Handy; when Handy was appointed promoter general of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1892, he would follow him to Chicago as his assistant. After working as Handy's assistant Anderson worked as a secretary for Buffalo Bill,Michaeli p. 17 following the showman's Wild West Show to its ranch in North Platte, Nebraska. Unsatisfied with prairie life he returned to Chicago and attended the Chicago-Kent College of Law. After graduating in 1897 he befriended Robert S. Abbott, threatening a printer with the loss of city contracts unless it employed Abbott, and became a contributing editor of Abbott's Chicago Defender. He then became an attorney, serving as a county attorney and assistant corporation counsel under Mayor Fred Busse. He was the victim of an attempted robbery at 29th Street and Wabash Avenue on March 1, 1905. He was not intimidated and was armed. He shot one of the two assailants through his overcoat, the bullet passing through his lung, mortally wounding him. Political career A Republican, Anderson was elected to represent Chicago's 2nd ward in 1917, becoming Chicago's second African-American alderman after his predecessor Oscar Stanton De Priest. De Priest had resigned in scandal after being indicted of accepting a bribe from a gambling establishment, of which he would eventually be acquitted. Anderson was one of four African-American candidates for the office and was backed by City Hall and De Priest supporters. His main opponent in the race was William Rudolph Cowan, an African-American real-estate broker who had the backing of reformers. He won the contest, joining fellow Republican Hugh Norris in representing the 2nd ward on the City Council. De Priest attempted to retake his seat in 1918 but narrowly fell in the Republican primary to Major Robert R. Jackson, who would go on to win the general election. Throughout the 1920s he was a prominent ally of mayor William Hale Thompson and served as his floor leader in the Council. \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson had previously been alderman of the 2nd ward from 1900 to 1902 and was immensely popular with the city's African- American community.Schottenhamel p. 43 In 1921, when R. E. Parker of the Chicago Advocate confronted Thompson with the problems of 20,000 unemployed African-Americans and charged that the 2nd ward was full of graft and corruption, Anderson defended the mayor, calling Parker a \\"trouble maker among his own people\\", denying allegations of racism in Thompson's layoff practices, and responding to the charges of graft thus: In 1922 he had the architects Michaelsen & Rognstad, build him a house at 3800 S. Calumet, the surrounding area would take on the name of this house Bronzeville. Also in 1922 Anderson served on a committee looking into the Ku Klux Klan's alleged activities in the City's affairs, he and two other aldermen announced to the press that they had received death threats. In 1923 Chicago's wards were increased from 35 to 50, while the number of aldermen per ward was decreased from two to one. Jackson was redistricted to the new 3rd ward, while Anderson kept his 2nd ward seat. In 1923 he was implicated in collecting more than $15,000 in protection money in the span of twenty months from a black and tan resort. In light of a related grand jury investigation, an illness, and the fact that Thompson declined to seek re-election that year, it was rumored that he would step down as alderman as well. He still contested the election and won with a majority of 1,037 votes, defeating eight opponents to avoid a runoff. Democrat William Emmett Dever was elected mayor in 1923; Anderson opposed his 1924 budget, claiming that his proposed reclassification of hundreds of civil service jobs was meant to eliminate the current civil service workers. In that same year he served as a delegate to the 1924 Republican National Convention. Upon Thompson's return to the mayoral office following the 1927 election rumor had it that Anderson was likely to receive the \\"prize plum\\" of the chairmanship of the Council's finance committee, but Council Democrats worked to keep him off the committee and it seemed likely that the position would go instead to 30th ward alderman John Clark. In the 1931 election he initially had five opponents, but rulings by the board of election commissioners invalidated the nominating petitions for all of them, leaving him unopposed. In that year's mayoral election he abandoned Thompson,Schottenhamel p. 47 whose popularity had plummeted due to crime and the Great Depression and who would be decisively defeated in the contest by Democrat Anton Cermak.Schottenhamel p. 48 Nevertheless, the 2nd ward was one of five in the city that voted Thompson, and having campaigned expressly against Anderson Cermak removed him from the finance committee. Later in the year he considered running for the United States House of Representatives against De Priest, then the only African- American in Congress. The Chicago Review, despite its dislike for De Priest, suggested that such a course of action was ill-advised, a conclusion also reached by The New York Age. He did not run for re-election in 1933, and was succeeded in office by William L. Dawson, who had the backing of the De Priest organization. In 1936 he ran for the Republican nomination for Illinois's 1st congressional district, falling to De Priest. De Priest would in turn lose to Democrat Arthur Wergs Mitchell. Personal life Anderson was a partner of Chicago-based Anderson-Watkins Film Co., which in 1913 produced and distributed a three-reel film known as A Day at Tuskegee. Anderson was married to Julia E. Anderson prior to her death in 1931. He would elope with Oneita Starks in 1933, remaining married to her until his death. Having been ill since Christmas, he died in his Chicago home on May 28, 1946, of bronchial pneumonia. Services were held in St. Thomas' Episcopal Church on June 1.

It was proclaimed by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810 and surveyed by James Meehan in 1811. The historic pavilion was designed by George Matcham Pitt Jr. in 1882 and built by Samuel Boughton in 1883‚Äì84. The park is owned by Hawkesbury City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010.  History  Before any European colonisation of the Richmond area, the Hawkesbury region was once inhabited by the Dharug people. The riparian area along the Hawkesbury River had been a food source for the local Aboriginal people for over 50,000 years and, with relatively frequent floods that spread enriched alluvium throughout the surrounding land, the region was known to be an abundant and reliable resource for food.LandArc, Draft Plan of Management, 2009 Following European colonisation, the new colonists quickly recognised the agricultural potential of the banks of the Hawkesbury River. This led to intensive farming of the area to supply food to the developing colony that was experiencing severe shortages in the early years. However, following flooding in 1799, 1800, 1806 and 1809, life for the colonists farming the flats of the Hawkesbury River was a hard one, fraught with potential devastation with any inundation of the riverMorris, Jack & Britton, CMP, 2003 As one of the first tasks following his appointment as the Governor of New South Wales in 1810, Lachlan Macquarie was instructed by the British Government to survey and select five flood-free sites along the Hawkesbury River to determine which were best suited for new townships. To protect the future prosperity of the colony, the development of the selected towns was intended to expand food production and promote progress, self-sufficiency and sustainability amongst the settlers. Macquarie had intended to encourage the farming communities, established in the high- risk flood plains, to relocate and settle in the new townships, thus providing refuge and security for the farmers themselves as well as their livestock and crops.Morris, Jack & Britton, 2003Godden Mackay, 1996Trustees of NSW Library, 1956Broadbent & Hughes, 1992Higginbotham, 1997 The five towns, personally and specifically selected by Governor Macquarie, were to become Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce. Of these new sites, Richmond was the first to be chosen by Macquarie, officially defined in December 1810 and laid out by the Government Surveyor, James Meehan, on 10 January 1811. Originally, ten acres (four hectares) of land in the centre of the town was reserved by Macquarie as the location of \\"the great square\\", now Richmond Park.Morris, Jack & Britton, CMP, 2003, p7 Located between two principal thoroughfares running from east to west, the position of this open space was conceived as a central marketplace for the new town and as a suitable site for the activities of the local community. Originally established when the town pattern was laid out in 1811, the size of the \\"Market Place\\" was reduced to its present size (3.2 hectares) after 1821 when the western strip of land, boarded by West Market Street, was reallocated for purposes of law and order.Register of the National Estate, 1981 In 1811 the Government surveyor, James Meehan, established the grid pattern of streets including the \\"Market Square\\", bounded by Windsor and March Streets, East Market and West Market Streets. The reserved open space was reduced after 1821 to an area of 7 acres 3 roods 37 perches (i.e. the present area of 3.23 ha). The remaining portion of Crown reserve, between the \\"square\\" and West Market Street, was set aside for other purposes including building a watch house and later the Court House, post office, Masonic Lodge, School of Arts and public school. Although the \\"square\\" may have been used initially as a marketplace, as shown on the 1827 plan of Richmond, it appears that this parcel of public open space had become a popular venue for cricket and football (possibly rugby union), were played in latter years, cricket has remained the major sporting activity for over 160 years.Morris, Jack & Britton, 2003, quoted in LandArc, 2009, 32 Despite the reduction in size, the marketplace, at least in the 1820s and 1830s, was used for buying and selling stock and crops. In the 1840s however, the land was largely cleared of vegetation and the site underwent a change in use from a marketplace to an area for more active recreational purposes, particularly for athletics ('foot races') and cricket. By the 1840s almost all of the square's native vegetation of River Flat Eucalypt Forest (Alluvial Woodland) had been cleared with only a few original trees standing. The clearing of vegetation resulted in the ground becoming uneven and boggy after rain, strewn with fallen logs, tree stumps and noxious weeds. Up until the park was fenced in 1864, cattle and horses (a common feature of the Richmond streetscape) would graze untethered and without approval, leading to further degradation of the park grounds. The few remaining (original) trees disappeared over the years as successive improvements and overlays of planting of generic native and exotic trees, shrubs and borders were introduced. The aging River oaks (Casuarina cunninghamiana), swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta) and river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) have all been introduced during later park embellishments. None of the original native vegetation survives today. Although the poor condition of the park was not an immediate issue for Richmond, in 1864 the town became more closely linked to Sydney with the construction of the Richmond railway line. With this line, came prosperity and an increasing public interest in developing and improving the town. Made up of local community members, the Improvement Committee was established around this time to focus on enhancing the appearance of the square and the facilities available to the public. With the help of the local community, this involved levelling the degraded parkland, laying turf to improve the quality of the cricket pitch, planting both native and exotic species of trees ('river oak, myall and red cedar and exotics English oak, conifers, beech (Fagus sp.), poplar, cork (Quercus suber) and Judas (Cercis siliquastrum) trees') and installing wooden seats for the comfort of the park users.LandArc, 2009, 33Botanic names added by Stuart Read, 18 March 2010 With the renewed community effort to improve this area of public open space, the status of the square was changing and, in 1868, the site was officially gazetted for public recreation. It was also around this same time that the site became first known as Richmond Park. In 1872 Richmond became a borough and in 1873 the newly elected Richmond Municipal Council was appointed as trustee of the park by the Department of Lands. This provided the catalyst for a new phase of coordinated development. In its newly improved state and with the official change in status, a board of trustees made up of local community members was appointed to take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the Park. The local trustees were William Bowman (a local politician and grazier), Stephen Field (property owner) and Edward Powell (a farmer and Justice of the Peace). In an effort to further develop the park's design and collection of plantations, the trustees wrote in 1870 to Charles Moore, the Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, to request suitable trees (both exotics and Australian sub-tropical rainforest species) for planting around the boundary. A similar request to the Botanic Gardens was made again in 1873, this time from the Municipal Council who took over vested interest in the park from the local trustees in 1873, on behalf of the CrownLandArc, 2009, 34 The plants supplied by the Sydney Botanic Gardens, as well as Australian natives, included a mix of species commonly found in public places of Britain and Europe (including exotics such as poplars (Populus spp., planes (Platanus sp.), mixed conifers (Pinus and Cupressus spp.) and Australian sub-tropical rainforest species such as hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), red cedar (Toona ciliata), white cedar (Melia azedarach var. australasica), silky oak (Grevillea robusta), swamp mahogany and brush box (Lophostemon confertus). The African olive (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) on the Windsor Street frontage is believed to be one of the earliest plantings in the park. Other early introductions included the informal row of river oaks, a local native species (Casuarina cunninghamiana) along the western boundary. These were intermixed with local rainforest species (Araucaria, Toona and Melia spp.) and other introduced evergreen and deciduous ornamentals such as the Cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense) and hackberry/nettle tree (Celtis occidentalis). Swamp mahogany specimens remain on two sides of the park. Many of these trees continue to define the park's historic landscape character and visual integrity. An 1879 photographSH1662 Government Printing OfficeMitchell Library clearly shows fenced plantations (the outer perimeter fence (i.e. painted hardwood post and double rail) was installed during this period and the boundary plantation was protected with a second double rail fence) around the park within the foreground trees from 2‚Äì6 m tall including hoop pines, silky oaks, Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra \\"Italica\\", big cone pine (Pinus coulteri), Mediterranean cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens) and other species. The large mature trees (some of which remain from at least the 1870s) include tall, dominant include four hoop pines (two on the western edge, two in the north-eastern corner), river oaks (two large trees on the western edge), a deliberate specimen planting of river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis)(several in the south-western corner), Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis) in the north-eastern corner, a red cedar (Toona ciliata) and silky oaks (Grevillea robusta). The inner park plantations were typically defined by an eclectic mix of botanical specimens.LandArc, 2007, quoted in LandArc, 2009, 34 The park's boundary plantations of emergent hoop and Bunya pines with their dark, glossy foliage, distinctive symmetrical forms, towering dimensions and massive scale, were used for dramatic impact. 13 Bunya pines were planted possibly as early as the 1860s, but were later removed in 1946 due to the potential danger to the public from massive cones falling from their tops. The hoop pines were retained. Most of Sydney's 19th-century parks reflect this layout and palette pioneered by Charles Moore (director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney 1848‚Äì96) and that of Joseph Henry Maiden, Moore's successor as director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney (1896‚Äì1924). Their influence had a profound impact on Sydney's public parks and gardens. They provided Sydney with a lasting legacy of great 19th- and early 20th-century landscapes including the Botanic Gardens, Domain, Moore Park and Centennial Parklands.LandArc, 2007, 19, quoted in LandArc, 2009, 35 Creation of public parks in a common design was a global practice in the late nineteenth century and one that intended to provide an enjoyable pleasant environment for the community as well as, in Australia, reflect the picturesque and idealized landscape of Europe. During this period, the Park's collection of plantations grew increasingly complex and eclectic. Nursery suppliers and local people contributed to the collection - although some species added were not suited to the environment and ultimately failed, many flourished. By 1883, more than 143 trees were recorded in Richmond Park. The provision of these types of parks also had a scientific role in the community as arboretums. Diverse collections of plantations, many individually identified with plaques on trees bearing botanical and common names, was typical of early municipal parks. Some plaques remain today and these indicate that the educational purpose of Richmond Park continued well into the twentieth century (inter-war and post-war periods).Morris, Jack & Britton, 2003, 50 To beautify the [ark, the 1880s saw a more elaborate design layout implemented by the Council. Three distinct areas of the Park were created - the \\"Outer Park\\" including the border plantations; the \\"Inner Park\\" including designed flower beds, shrubs and public seating that were interconnected by encircling pathways; and the \\"Central Area\\" with the large grassed oval that was increasingly being used for organised sporting activities. The \\"inner park\\" of 1879 consisted of exotic shrubs and border planting. This early garden layout is typical of the Gardenesque Style ( 1835‚Äì1890) which reflected the classical, formal influences of the Victorian, Georgian, Regency, Classical and Italianate architectural styles of the period. The park's design featured an elaborate layout of fenced triangular planting beds which were interconnected by a rigid geometric pattern of formal gravel pathways. The \\"inner park\\" gardens lay between the cricket oval (open space) and the outer perimeter tree plantation creating, for the first time, a multi-layered effect. In 1882 the park's oval boundary was formalised with a painted post and single-top Arris rail fence. Both the oval and outer boundary fences were later replaced with a timber post, tubular steel top rail and wire-mesh fence. This structural layout of the park established three separate and inter-related components - a defined central sporting space (cricket ground), surrounded by perimeter pathways and gardens and an outer wooded park boundary. Seating and public amenities were added and the park gained broad recognition for its quality. It was featured in the 1886 County of Cumberland Year Book.LandArc, 2009, 35-6 Further embellishment saw the incorporation of built elements. In 1882, the lack of any permanent buildings was recognised and it was decided that a pavilion, overlooking the sports field, should be constructed to add necessary distinction and amenity. The design was opened to a general competition that invited architects to design a structure that would seat about 300 people but cost no more than ¬£300. It was also to be built of timber on brick piers, have a small room for the use of athletes and cricketers and be facing east across the oval. The competition generated much interest and, in March 1882, the entry named \\"Energy\\", designed by George Matcham Pitt junior was selected despite its cost, estimated to be 360 pounds. To build it there was only one tender. Samuel Boughton, a popular member of the local community, was given the job and, despite the \\"Erected 1883\\" inscription on one of the stone piers, construction was completed in early 1884. This pavilion has remained a dominant built feature since the 1880s and, although severely damaged by fire in 1980 and restored by 1994, it continues to bring a historic nineteenth- century resonance to the Park (. During the period that the pavilion was being constructed, work was also undertaken on improving the cricket ground. In 1882, at a price of over ¬£120, the ground and pavilion were enclosed with a fence and a concrete wicket was laid on the oval. The request for these improvement works had come from the Richmond Cricket Club and, with the support of Mayor Holborow (a strong cricket supporter himself), the park was becoming an increasingly popular place for local and visiting teams (including a touring English team in 1887) to play cricket (LandArc, 2009 The park was also used, although to a much smaller extent, as a football ground. An application to install goal posts (presumably for rugby union) was received by Council in 1882, but approval was only granted with careful supervision to ensure the cricket oval was not affected. However, after being recognised as a safety concern for the football players, it was decided that the concrete pitch would be turfed in winter and exposed in spring and summer. Despite its use as a football ground, cricket has been the most popular sport played in the park throughout its history and the long-term community support for the sport is reflected in its continued dominance today. In 1892, with the opening of the Richmond Waterworks by the invited Governor Lord Jersey and his wife, Council decided to install a water fountain to commemorate the event. Initial plans indicate the fountain was to be placed in front of the pavilion but, in the days leading up to the event, the position was changed to the Windsor Street frontage. At a cost of 30 pounds, the modest but handsome statue was designed with three iron statues of a winged cherub with a mermaid's tail, anchored on a stone base plinth. Although the fountain remains today, the cherub statues have been stolen but bolt holes do indicate where they were once positioned on the fountain. The fountain also, for a significant period of time, has been dry and inactive, now surrounded by a garden bed. The fountain was a three-tiered iron fountain, which may well have been manufactured by Coalbrookdale and imported from England (grant application, 2011). Successive phases of park upgrades and embellishment, including tree planting were implemented throughout the early 20th century, albeit interrupted by two world wars and a depression. A large proportion of the park's trees (particularly along the eastern and southern boundaries) were introduced during the inter-war period (c.1915-40) and post-war period (c. 1940s‚Äì60s). Many of the park's evergreen and deciduous exotics such as camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), English oaks (Quercus robur), elms (Ulmus spp.), plane trees (Platanus spp.), hackberry/nettle trees (Celtis sp.), poplars, cypress (Cupressus sp.), California fan palms (Washingtonia robusta), 2 Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis) were planted during these two eras. They remain important visual and structural elements.LandArc, 2009, 36 The park's elms (Ulmus √ó hollandica) are believed to be a hybrid (Ulmus glabra x Ulmus minor) rather than a mix of Ulmus procera (English), Ulmus carpinifolia and Ulmus glabra (Scotch or wych).Morris, Jack & Britton, 2003, 45 The massive big cone pine (Pinus coulteri) is an uncommon exotic planting in Sydney and likely dates from this latter phase of planting. Other mature trees include Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia), pin oaks (Quercus palustris), Photinia glabra, blue Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica 'Glauca'), brush box, Brazilian pepper trees (Schinus molle var.areira) and kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 23/11/09, updated 18 March 2010 The inter-war period ushered in a period of significant change for Richmond Park with construction of the Richmond‚ÄìKurrajong railway line extension in 1924. A line from Richmond to Kurrajong (a significant producer of citrus, vegetables and firewood), was considered desirable for the town and given approval. Despite not being economically viable, with earnings not expected to cover the costs of running and maintaining the line, construction did proceed. The chosen route ran along March Street and cut across (and required excision of) the south-east corner of the Park, which resulted in the loss of landscape and a number of mature trees. There was a significant public outcry about placement of the line and its likely impact on the Park but, despite public meetings and lobbying, the trees were felled and the line was opened in 1924. The rail line typically carried one goods train, one passenger train and one mixed goods and passenger train each weekday. Although running at a loss for many years, in 1952, a flood near the North Richmond Bridge caused enough damage to the line to warrant a call to end all services. The Commissioner of Railways could not justify the cost to repair the damage and so the rails were removed and Richmond Park was restored to its original size and shape. Around the new plantings in this area of the Park, signage and a curvaceous brick pathway, although not accurately reflective of the former positioning of the rails, was installed in the s to interpret this period of the Park's history. The work was done by Windsor Municipal Council, Richmond Council having amalgamated with it in 1948. In the 1950s there was a proposal for shops to be built on park land facing Windsor Street. This did not happen, but the park did fall into disrepair at this time, according to Geyer.Michaelis, 1994, 5 A war memorial, a common feature of Australian parks, has also been a part of the site, on the East Market Street frontage, since the early twentieth century. This monument now commemorates not only the two world wars, but also the efforts of the local soldiers in Vietnam and the early twenty-first century' \\"International Campaign Against Terror\\". The memorial was once fenced but, with the discovery and excavation of two 1855 cannons buried near the pavilion, the fencing was removed and the canons installed, flanking the monument. It appears that, after significant degradation, they were buried in the Inter-war period but, following their rediscovery in 1985, were unearthed and restored by the No. 2 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Richmond before being returned to Council in 1988. There was some debate about whether Council should donate the cannons to the RAAF or the Powerhouse Museum but it was decided to install the cannons alongside the memorial. About 1992 a mature Californian fan palm (Washingtonia robusta) was transplanted to the northern side of the war memorial. It was one of a row which began in the park (with no. 70) and continued along the side of the railway. When the line was electrified, State Rail paid to relocate the palm to the war memorial site. The new palm (no.69) at about 30m tall, is almost half as tall again as its companion.Michaelis, 1994, 7LandArc, 2009, 37 The children's playground was replaced and upgraded with new structures and soft fall areas. A sinuous brick pathway was built in 1988 to represent the railway extension in the park's south-east. In 1977 the Crown reserve was revoked and ownership of the park was invested with Windsor Municipal Council. In 1980 Council merged with Colo Shire Council to become Hawkesbury Shire Council (and Hawkesbury City Council in 1989). The park experienced considerable development throughout the last two decades of the 20th century. Many of these additions, however, have been somewhat unsympathetic towards the park's heritage values. As a result of increasing public concern and pressure, an interim conservation order was placed on the park by the Heritage Council in 1985. This lapsed in 1987Morris, Jack & Britton, 2003, 20 during a time of intense pressure to create job opportunities and projects during the lead-up to the Bicentennial celebrations in 1988. A number of capital works projects were subsequently initiated. For the Bicentenary some re-landscaping of the war memorial and south-eastern corners was done. A consultant, Jim Hutchinson, now Manager of City Parks for Sydney City Council, redesigned the war memorial area, removing a wire fence and shrub or annual beds and recommending planting of plane trees along East Market Street. Six specimens of planes (Platanus x hybrida) were planted at four-meter intervals.Michaelis, 1994, 5-6 Further development occurred in the Park around the late twentieth and the early years of the twenty-first century. The pavilion (which had been damaged by fire in 1980) was restored in 1993‚Äì94. Public amenities and a maintenance/storage building were built in \\"Federation style\\" near the pavilion. A similar style of rotunda was added to the north-west corner of the Park in 2002, across an early pathway alignment. Flower beds and additional seating were introduced. A public artwork initiative was partially implemented. Although Richmond Park has undergone consistent change over the two centuries since Governor Macquarie designated the area as open space for the community, the site continues to be a distinguishing element in the townscape and one that is an important asset to the community. The focus and layout may have changed but the popularity and value of Richmond Park remains. =Comparisons with similar parks= In 1810, when Lachlan Macquarie was appointed as Governor of NSW, he personally selected five sites along the Hawkesbury River on which new townships were developed. At this time, the town planning instigated by Macquarie often included a designated central park that was open space to be used by the community. Of these five townships, three did contain reserved open public space. Along with Richmond, there are also parks in both Windsor and Wilberforce. In Windsor, the McQuade Park has been a public reserve used for recreation and activities for some 200 years. The Park is a significant asset to the local community who continue to use the site for recreation, celebrations, events and commemoration. The site also contains a war memorial and sporting oval (not unlike Richmond Park). The Wilberforce Park is another example of Macquarie's town planning. The site, like the others, is in a central location that provides an open space for the community in an urban environment. This park also has a war memorial and is used by the community for recreation and commemoration. The Wilberforce Park, however, is unique in that it remains the same size today that was originally designated by Governor Macquarie in 1810. Although not one of the five personally selected towns along the Hawkesbury River, Bigge Park in Liverpool was also public open space defined by Macquarie in 1810 and surveyed by James Meehan (the same surveyor for Richmond Park). The provision of public open space was a recurring feature in the town planning of Governor Macquarie and these parks, along with Richmond Park, are rare examples surviving in NSW today.  Description  Richmond Park sits on 3.2 hectares in a central location in the town, bounded by Windsor, March and East Market Streets. On the western boundary, the Park is neighboured by the Richmond School of Arts, the RSL, an apartment block, Neighbourhood Centre, Early Childhood Centre/Country Women's Association, Court House and former Richmond Post Office. The soil of the park is unusual for Western Sydney, being basaltic in origin.Geyer, interview, 6 October 1994 It is rich and deep and, the water table being fairly close to the surface, lack of moisture is usually not a problem. It is probably due to this soil that a number of English and European species have flourished in the park, although the climate of Richmond is more extreme than is ideal for these species, being drier than coastal Sydney, with more extreme temperatures, frosts and temperatures over 38 degrees each year. The open green space of the Park is an important element in the townscape and it is one that, although modified over the past two centuries, continues to be a valued space in the Richmond community. As a designed landscape, Richmond Park is clearly discernable into three separate but inter-related areas: * \\"Outer Park\\" - border tree plantations * \\"Inner Park\\" - shrubs, flower beds, public seating and pathways * \\"Central area\\" - grassed oval for sporting activities The design of the Park intended to create an attractive public open space that would suit passive recreation and the needs of the community, as well as coexist harmoniously with the increasing use of the space for sporting activities. This intended design, although modified, is still extant today. The vegetation has changed, it is no longer native, but the presence of large mature trees in the \\"Outer Park\\" still reflect the original intention of using border plantations to frame the Park within the townscape. The aging River oaks (Casuarina cunninghamiana), swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta) and river red gums (E.camaldulensis) have all been introduced during later park embellishments. None of the original native vegetation survives today. The inner park plantations were typically defined by an eclectic mix of botanical specimens. The park's boundary plantations of emergent hoop and Bunya pines with their dark, glossy foliage, distinctive symmetrical forms, towering dimensions and massive scale, were used for dramatic impact. 13 Bunya pines were planted possibly as early as the 1860s, but were later removed in 1946 due to the potential danger to the public from massive cones falling from their tops. The hoop pines were retained. In the north-western corner is a playground, dominated by a massive plane treePlatanus x hybrida, no. 12 whose seasonal sun and shade are much appreciated. The northeastern corner is shady, especially in summer when planes and elms are in full foliage, and provides alternative seating. This corner has a skyline dominated by the hoop pines and the slash pine (no.29).Michaelis, 1994, 8-9 Other tree species in the park include white cedar (Melia azederach var.australasica), Cape chestnut (Calodendron capense), Queensland pittosporum (P.rhombifolium), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), manna gum (Eucalyptus nichollii), sweet pittosporum (P.undulatum), African olive (Olea europaea var.africana), silky oak (Grevillea robusta), Mediterranean cypress/pencil pine (Cupressus sempervirens), trident maple (Acer buegerianum), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Wheatley elm (Ulmus carpinifolia), Scotch elm (U.glabra), brown pine or Illawarra plum (Podocarpus elatus), camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua cv.), Bhutan cypress (Cupressus torulosa), rough barked cypress (C.glabra), juniper (Juniperus communis 'Stricta'), peach (Prunus persica cv.), red cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera 'Nigra'), tallow wood (Eucalyptus microcorys), white poplar (Populus alba) and coral tree (Erythrina indica).Michaelis, 1994, 12-14 Shrub species in the park include flowering/Japanese quince (Chaenoemeles speciosa cv.), apple blossom (Abelia x grandiflora), rose of Sharon (Hibiscus rosa- syriacus cv.), may bush (Spiraea cantonensis 'Lanceata'), Camellia japonica as a feature of a small shrub bed (no. 132) along with more flowering quince (2)(133). By having fewer trees in the \\"Inner Park\\", the design also prevents limitations to the views across the open space. Within the \\"Inner Park\\", the layout includes garden beds, public seating, pathways and some built structures that provide for the community's use of the Park. =Built structures= A rotunda in a \\"Federation style\\" resembling the nineteenth- century pavilion, was installed in the north-west corner in 2002. This adjoins a modern children's playground. On the Windsor Street frontage, a modest iron fountain, although not in its original form, remains extant. The original fountain, installed in 1892, was designed with three statues of a winged cherub with a mermaid's tail on a stone base plinth. The fountain remains extant today but these statues are no longer part of the structure. A sign on the base explains what the fountain once looked like as well as outlining that the cherub statues had been stolen. There are visible bolt holes though, that do indicate where the statues were once positioned on the fountain. Today, this fountain is dry and has not contained water for many years. A flower bed, encircling the fountain, has since been installed. Along this northern boundary, there is also a small plinth with a sundial. A mounted plaque states \\"In appreciation of 49 years of continuous service to the Hawkesbury community by Rozzoli Family Jewellers, 1946‚Äì1995. Erected by: Richmond Chamber of Commerce\\". At the corner of Windsor and East Market Streets, a large \\"RICHMOND\\" sign has also been installed in the Park. There is a plaque on this sign stating that it is in memory of Samuel Boughton, a popular local personality and builder of the Park's 1884 Pavilion. Along the East Market Street frontage, is a war memorial in the form of an obelisk commemorating the war efforts of the local soldiers. Around the main World War I monument, are four smaller pillars, commemorating the effort and losses in World War II, Vietnam and the \\"International Campaign Against Terror\\". Following excavation and restoration, two 1855 canons (discovered at the site in 1985) have been installed. These canons now flank the war memorial. At the south-east corner of the Park, a brick pathway and interpretative signage was installed (in 1988) to highlight the former presence of the Richmond to Kurrajong railway line across this section of the Park. This curvaceous pathway, although intended to represent the rail line (removed in 1952), is largely inaccurate and misrepresentative of this episode in the Park's history. As a landscape, Richmond Park is dominated by the grassed cricket oval in the centre. Physically, this oval is a major component in the Park and it is where the organised sporting activities, particularly cricket, have been played throughout the Park's history. Since the late nineteenth century, the oval has been fenced and overlooked by the pavilion, the dominant built structure in the Park. As originally intended, the attractive timber and iron structure provides an amenity as well as bringing historical character to the Park. The current Pavilion was severely damaged by fire in 1980 but was comprehensively restored by 1994. This restoration was not entirely faithful to the detailing of the original building but the Pavilion that stands today does continue to display the historical character of the site, as well as being a focal point in Richmond Park. Since 1999, the Pavilion or grandstand has been named Rod McConville Stand. A plaque mounted on one of the brick piers explains that the naming was in memory of Rod McConville \\"for his outstanding service to the local community to sport especially cricket\\". Another plaque, on the second brick pier, notes the conservation works undertaken to restore the Pavilion in the early 1990s, following the 1980 fire. = Condition = The condition of Richmond Park, as a whole, is very good. Although not original, the extant plantations contribute to the amenity of the Park and coexist harmoniously with the built structures and sports field. The built features, namely the pavilion, rotunda, war memorial and fountain, are also in good condition. After a fire in 1980, the pavilion was comprehensively restored to reflect the original design. The rotunda, built in 2002, was also built to reflect the historic style of the neighbouring Pavilion. The fountain, although in reasonable condition, is missing the three cherub statues (having been apparently stolen). The war memorial is in good condition. Some of the mature native pines (Araucaria species) are showing dieback at their tops and outer branches, which may be due to ground compaction, dryness or air pollution.Stuart Read, 10/2001 Although the current plantations may not be original and the layout may have been altered from the historic design, Richmond Park retains its integrity. Essentially, Governor Macquarie's intention for a public open space in a central location remains extant. The three distinct sections, the \\"Outer Park\\" (border plantations), \\"Inner Park\\" (flower beds and pathways) and Central area (grassed sporting oval), remain clear as well. The pavilion, even though not in its original state having been comprehensively restored following a fire in 1980, retains and contributes a historic resonance to Richmond Park. Being a nineteenth-century park, there has been some modern development that has intruded on the integrity of the site. The construction of the rotunda (built in 2002 but in a similar style to the 1884 pavilion), the playground and the small car park in the south-west corner are also fairly intrusive. However, the modern constructions do reflect the continuity of use of Richmond Park and its continued popularity and use by the community. Even though the different elements of the Park have undergone various changes, when viewed together they do reflect the original design of the landscape, thus contributing to the integrity of Richmond Park. = Modifications and dates = As a landscape, Richmond Park has undergone various changes over its 200-year history. From early documentation and photographs, it would appear the landscape design and plantations have changed somewhat but, as a cohesive environment, the Park retains its value within the Richmond townscape. Plantings over time in the \\"Outer\\" park have evolved. An 1879 photograph clearly shows fenced plantations around the park within the foreground trees from 2-6m tall including hoop pines (Araucaria cunninhamii), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra \\"Italica\\", stone pines (Pinus pinea), Mediterranean cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens) and other species. Silky oaks and hoop pines remain dominant species in the canopy of trees around the park today.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 23/11/09 Despite successive phases of improvements and embellishments throughout its history, Richmond Park retains the important visual and structural elements that contribute to the significance of the site to both the local community and the State. The pavilion, arguably the most dominant built structure within the Park, was built in 1882 but, following a fire in 1980, the Pavilion was severely damaged. After being comprehensively restored by 1994, although not entirely faithful to the original detailing of the building, the pavilion continues to be an important element in the historic character of the Park. The Inter-war period bought further change to Richmond Park with the introduction of the Richmond to Kurrajong railway line across the south-east corner of the Park in 1924. When the rail lines were installed, trees were felled and vegetation removed but after the line was closed in 1952, the rails were removed and this corner of the Park reinstated and revegetated. In the late 1980s, an interpretative brick pathway and informative signage was installed in the same corner of the Park to be a permanent reminder of this point in the history of Richmond Park. The late twentieth and early twenty- first centuries also bought considerable development to Richmond Park and not all of this was sympathetic to it heritage values. A rotunda was constructed in the north-west corner in 2002, in a style resembling that of the adjacent pavilion. With a neighbouring modern playground, these additions have, in some form, diminished the integrity of the Park. The war memorial has also undergone some change, with the installation of two 1855 canons in the s.  Heritage listing  Richmond Park is of State significance as a rare surviving example of the town planning of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Richmond was the first of five towns along the Hawkesbury River, personally selected by Governor Macquarie in 1810. When laying out the township in 1811, Macquarie reserved a central location for the development of this open green space for the community. Richmond Park has retained its original intention as an open public green space and continues to be a legible example of one of the key elements of Macquarie's town plan for Richmond. Its central location within the urban environment has contributed to the continuity of use of Richmond Park by the community for 200 years. The cohesive landscape design, surviving from the mid-nineteenth century, is representative of early municipal parks in NSW and today, it retains precisely the association with the layout of central Richmond envisaged by Macquarie in 1810. Richmond Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Historically, Richmond Park has State significance as a public park that was specifically reserved by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810 for the new township of Richmond. The Park continues to demonstrate its original use as a marketplace, where the community could trade stock and crops, as well as its later use for more recreational activities (particularly as a cricket ground). Richmond Park also continues to demonstrate the early community efforts to beautify the Park (s) that resulted in the designed layout taking form. Although Richmond Park has undergone various changes over the two centuries since the land was first marked out in 1810, this open greenspace continues to reflect Macquarie's original intention and it retains its significance as a distinguishing element in the townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Richmond Park has State significance for its association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Following his appointment as Governor of NSW in 1810, Macquarie was instructed by the British Government to select five sites best suited for new townships along the Hawkesbury River. Richmond was the first to be chosen and when laid out, a 10-acre (4-hectare) plot of land in the centre of the town was reserved for the creation of a public park. This dedication of Crown land for public use was common with Macquarie's town planning practices, and the reserved park was to become a central marketplace for the new town and a site for the activities of the community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Richmond Park has local significance for its aesthetic values. As an open green space in the centre of town, the Park has always been a public landscape within an urban environment. The collection of plantations and cohesive design was intended to provide an attractive and pleasant environment for community recreation and, although the strength of the landscape design may have diminished since its inception, the Park retains its ability to provide an open green landscape for the enjoyment of the community. Its location and collection of fauna also continues to make the Park a distinguishing element in the Richmond townscape. The cultural features of the Park, namely the pavilion and war memorial, also contribute to the aesthetic value of the site. The pavilion, although comprehensively restored in 1994, is a dominant built structure in the Park and continues to reflect the nineteenth-century character of the site. The war memorial, an important element of many municipal parks in NSW, is also an attractive and socially valuable feature of Richmond Park. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Richmond Park has local significance for its social value to the community. Originally reserved as a market square for the people of the new township, Richmond Park has been an important asset to the community and one that has been consistently used over two centuries. With a grassed oval for active recreation (particularly cricket) and available seating within an attractive landscape for passive enjoyment, the Park has been a valued space for the community and an attractive element of the Richmond townscape for 200 years. By combining both active and passive recreation, commemoration and public sentiment, Richmond Park has been an open space well used by the local community. The types of use may have changed but its continuity of use has remained consistent. The presence of a war memorial at the Park is also a significant feature that enables the community to commemorate the effort and loss of local soldiers in active service. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Richmond Park has been a greenspace site since European settlement and has undergone much change over the two centuries since its creation. As such, archaeological potential is likely to be low. The interpretative pathway and signage that indicates the positioning of the Richmond to Kurrajong railway line (that ran across the south-east corner of the Park from 1934 to 1952) is, in its current state, largely inaccurate and misleading. There is potential, therefore, to investigate this site for the original alignment of this railway line. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Richmond Park has State significance for its rarity value in NSW. When Governor Macquarie was appointed in 1810, he was instructed by the British Government to select and survey five suitable sites along the Hawkesbury River for new townships. Of these five sites, Richmond was the first to be laid out in January 1811. Originally conceived as a central marketplace for the new township, the survival of Richmond Park makes it a rare example of the town plan envisaged by Macquarie in 1810. The Park also retains its original intended use, being an open green space for the use of the community, which also contributes to its rarity value. (See Comparisons in History for other surviving public parks reserved by Governor Macquarie) The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Richmond Park has State significance as a representative example of a municipal park that has retained and expanded its use and community value over 200 years. Dedicating Crown land for public purposes was a common element in early town planning, both in NSW and around the world, and Richmond Park is a good example of how a Park can evolve to suit the needs of the local community. Positioned in the centre of Richmond, the Park has remained an open space for the activities of the local community throughout this time and, like many early parks, it has had a long history of cricket being played at the ground. Like many other parks in NSW, Richmond Park is a representative example of the simple and well-used landscape design of encircling a grassed cricket ground with a low fenced boundary and surrounding vegetation. The inclusion of a war memorial is also a common feature in Australian parks. A place for commemoration to honour the war effort of local soldiers is a significant aspect of many parks and Richmond Park is a good example of how this feature continues to be important to the community (the Park now includes a pillar honouring the efforts in the current (2009) \\"International Campaign Against Terror\\"). Richmond Park is also representative of the landscape design and layout of a nineteenth-century public park in NSW. Plant species were provided to the Park by the Sydney Botanic Gardens in 1870 and 1873 and, at this time, most parks in NSW were heavily influenced by the style pioneered by Charles Moore, the Director of the Botanic Gardens, and his successor, Joseph Henry Maiden. With the collection of plants becoming increasingly complex, Richmond Park also took on the role of an arboretum which was typical of early municipal parks in NSW.

Her first book, The Story of Owen: Dragon Slayer of Trondheim, was published in 2014, and is set in an alternate present-day Ontario where dragons are both real and a menace. The review in The New York Times called the book \\"a clever first step in the career of a novelist who [...] has many more songs to sing\\", it was nominated for the William C. Morris Award in 2015. A sequel, Prairie Fire, followed in 2015. Johnston's third book was A Thousand Nights, a retelling of One Thousand and One Nights. C.S. Lewis's descriptions of the desert in The Horse and His Boy inspired Johnston in writing her own novel set in the desert. A companion book, Spindle, followed in 2016, which was a reinterpretation of Sleeping Beauty. Her fifth novel, Exit, Pursued By A Bear, was published in 2016. Inspired by Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, it tells the story of cheer- leading captain Hermione Winters, who discovers she is pregnant after being sexually assaulted at a camp party. It was written partially as a challenge, and partially as a response to Stephen Woodworth's 2013 bill to re-criminalise abortion. It was named a \\"Book of the Year\\" by several organisations, including NPR, Publishers Weekly, and the New York Public Library. It won the Canadian Children's Book Centre's Amy Mathers Teen Book Award in 2017. A Star Wars fan, Johnston was asked to write a book on the character Ahsoka Tano. Published in October 2016, Ahsoka fills in the gap between her appearances in The Clone Wars and Rebels. Her second Star Wars novel, Queen's Shadow, was released in March 2019. Featuring Padme Amidala, Queen's Shadow is set in the years between the events of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.

When the Caldwell Historic District was surveyed in 1982, many brick historic buildings adjacent to the district were not included. The district includes Romanesque Revival and modest commercial architecture, although some facades have been altered since construction. The 1982 site survey noted 14 buildings, and the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) July 19, 1982. With Original inventory * Saratoga Hotel (1904), 624 Main Street. The Saratoga was a 3-story, Ch√¢teau style hotel and featured a Mansard roof with hipped dormers and corner turrets. Owner Ralph V. Sebree named the hotel after the Saratoga Hotel in Chicago, managed by his uncle. A 1923 renovation by Tourtellotte & Hummel removed the French details and expanded the hotel to four stories. The building was demolished after it burned in a fire on December 19, 1990. * Commercial Building (1904), 702, 704 Main Street and 103, 105, 107 7th Ave. The 2-story Caldwell Commercial Bank, also known as the Caldwell Bank and Trust Building, was designed by Tourtellotte & Co. and featured Romanesque Revival architecture. An early and longtime tenant was the Agustus Greenlund drugstore, 1904-1975. The building was renovated by Tourtellotte & Hummel in 1928, and the style was altered toward Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. * Steunenberg Block (1906), 706, 708 Main Street. The 2-story, Romanesque Revival style brick and sandstone building opened in August, 1906. Early tenants were the Herr Clothing Company and Boyes Hardware. Albert K. Steunenberg (September 11, 1863 - March 17, 1907) helped to organize the Caldwell Commercial Bank and the Caldwell Bank and Trust Co. He was also one of the owners of the Lowell-Steunenberg Building and the Lowell-Jackson-Steunenberg Building included below in the inventory. * Egleston Block (1906), 710 Main Street. The 2-story Egleston building was designed by Tourtellotte & Co. and features sand colored brick. The Exchange Saloon, one of Caldwell's oldest buildings, was demolished to make room for the Egleston Block. Early tenants were a branch of Alexander, a men's clothing store owned by Moses Alexander, and the Baker & Harris Grocery Co. * Roberts Building (1894); 712 Main Street. The 2-story Roberts Building is the earliest brick building in the district, and the facade incorporates Romanesque Revival features. The building replaced an earlier, wood frame structure at the same address which housed the Caldwell Butchering Company, begun in 1885 by owners Charles Picard and Mike Roberts. The Roberts Building later housed the Roberts Meat Market. In 1910 the Fraternal Order of Eagles leased the second floor of the building. * Creative Printing (1911); 714 Main Street. The 2-story building was constructed between 1908 and 1911, and the 1911 Sanborn Map indicates that the building functioned as a grocery store. At that time, the address was 716 Main Street, and the Roberts Building address was 714 Main Street. The Egleston Block occupied 710-712 Main Street, not 710 Main Street as current listings indicate. In 1920 Oakes Brothers, an adjacent business, converted the building to a storeroom. * Oakes Brothers Store (1906); 720 Main Street. The 1-story Oakes Brothers Store, more recently known as Maddy's Plaza, is a brick building constructed as retail space for Oakes Bros., a dry goods and shoe store. In 1890 G. C. Oakes, R. W. Oakes, A. M. Oakes, and C. A. Oakes opened a dry goods store in Caldwell's new Masonic building. The partnership was dissolved in 1891 when A. M. Oakes retired, but the remaining brothers continued in business, and in 1906 they moved into a larger building in what became the Caldwell Historic District. The store was constructed on what had been the site of Mohrs Boarding House and the Haskell House Hotel. * Harmon Building (1896); 722, 724 Main Street and 104 South Kimball Avenue. The 2-story Harmon Building was originally named the Lucas Block when the 1-story, brick building opened in 1896, and it replaced the wood frame Lucas Harness Shop at the same address. Features of the new building included an \\"elegant modern style with plate glass windows and colored skylights.\\" Lucas reopened his harness shop on the Kimball side of the building, and grocer L. E. Hay was an early tenant as was dry goods merchant T. K. Little. Little bought the building in 1899, and in 1906 he and architect Thomas H. Soule added a second floor with a corner turret. In 1920 L. A. Harmon became part owner and moved the Harmon Drug Store into the building. * Ballantyne Building (1910); 803 Main Street and 104 North Kimball Avenue. The 1-story brick and stone Ballantyne Building, also known as the Phoenix Building, was designed by Caldwell architect Thomas H. Soule for Alec Ballantyne of Ballantyne Mercantile Co., formerly The Ballantyne-Dee Mercantile Co. Beside Ballantyne Bros., early tenants of the building included Keeney & Cazier clothing and dry goods and the Owl Drug Store. Later, the Star Cigar Store and the Home Electric Bakery rented space. * Western Building (1903); 105-111 South Kimball Avenue; 802 Main Street. The 2-story Western Building, also known as the Froman-Davis Building and as the Baker Brothers Building, featured brick construction with a corner turret when it was built in 1903 for George Froman and Charles Davis. Unusual for Caldwell at the time, Froman and Davis included a 12-foot wide cement sidewalk in front of the building on Main Street and on Kimball Avenue. By 1910 Caldwell would have in progress 300 miles of paved sidewalks. Early tenants of the Froman-Davis building were Baker Brothers Grocery, the Idaho Abstract Co., and Dorothy Stewart's Millinery Parlour. The building was remodeled in 1906 when the Western National Bank replaced Baker Brothers Grocery as the building's main tenant. In 1926 Alexander's menswear became the main tenant, and the company remodeled the building in 1932, installing larger windows and removing the corner turret. * Union Block (1907); 113-123 South Kimball Avenue. The 2-story, brick and stone Union Block was designed by Caldwell architect Thomas H. Soule, with commercial space on the ground floor and offices above. Soon after construction, the second floor of the building became Caldwell's first major hospital, with 18 rooms and four attending physicians. Other early tenants were Barnes' Grocery, C. C. Smith Harness Shop, the Royal Cafe, and Cook & Over grocery. In 1908 J. T. Smith & Co. purchased Barnes' Grocery, and in the same year P. R. Getter bought J. T. Smith and opened the Union Grocery at the original Barnes location in the Union Block. When Cook & Over relocated in 1910, their storefront at the Union Block was replaced by the expanding Royal Cafe. Another eatery in the building as early as 1909 was the Fern Restaurant. The Union Block was saved from destruction by firefighters in 1907 when a fire destroyed the adjacent Commercial Hotel, also known as the Sisson Hotel, but the building eventually was demolished sometime after completion of the NRHP site survey of 1982. * Caldwell News (1903); 114 7th Avenue South. The 1-story Caldwell News building was a brick and stone structure that served the publishing needs of a local newspaper. In 1907 while F. G. Burroughs was publisher, fire damage caused a $4000 loss to the paper. J. Walter Johnson succeeded Burroughs as publisher in 1911, but in that year John C. Rice succeeded Johnson. In 1928, the Caldwell News merged with The Caldwell Tribune to become the Caldwell News-Tribune. The building was demolished sometime after a fire burned the adjacent Saratoga Hotel in 1990. * Rice Building (1906); 113-117 7th Avenue South. Named for John C. Rice, the stone and brick Rice Building, also known either as the Lowell-Steunenberg Building or as the Steunenberg and Lowell Block, may have been designed by architect C. L. Lee. Informally known as the Post Office Block, the building included the Caldwell Post Office as an early tenant. The Bell Telephone exchange office and E. H. Adams Stationery were other early tenants. After a 1910 renovation, tenants included the Caldwell News and grocers Cook & Over. Cook & Over soon was purchased by grocers Van Hyming and Manning, and the Caldwell News was purchased by John C. Rice. Rice bought the building and the adjacent Lowell Building in 1909. * Lowell Building (1907); 701, 705 Arthur Street and 121, 123 7th Avenue South. The 2-story brick and stone Lowell Building, also known as either the Lowell-Jackson building or the Lowell-Jackson-Steunenberg building, was designed by Boise architect C. L. Lee. The Caldwell Commercial Club leased the second floor, and other early tenants included the San Francisco, Idaho & Montana Railroad, Steunenberg Bros. Shoes, F. H. Bowen Jewelry, A. M. DeFrance & Co. Pool & Billiard Hall, and Sloan & Merritt Grocery. Owners included J. H. Lowell, a partner in the real estate firm of Lowell & Madden and an officer of the Caldwell Banking & Trust Co., A. K. Steunenberg, cashier of the bank, and T. S. Jackson, a partner in the legal firm of Jackson & Walters. In 1909 John C. Rice purchased the building and the adjacent Lowell-Steunenberg Building, and by that time the buildings together were known as the Lowell-Jackson building., although in 1909 The Caldwell News referenced the Rice and Lowell Block. Street names A Sanborn Map of the Caldwell Historic District and vicinity in 1911. Caldwell street names evolved from the names assigned in the original plat of 1883, and Kimball Avenue, named for Union Pacific ticket agent Thomas L. Kimball, is the only street in the Caldwell Historic District to keep its original name. In 1891 Front Street was changed to Main Street, Market Street became 1st Avenue South, and Canyon Avenue became 1st Avenue West. In 1907 an ordinance proposed by city councilor Herbert R. Cleaver reassigned 1st Avenue South as Arthur Street and 1st Avenue West as 7th Avenue. By that time, 1st Avenue West may have become known informally as Bank Street. References See also * Thomas K.

She is noted as being the first great female painter of post-independence Greece.  Biography  Eleni was born on the Greek island of Spetses in 1821. She was the daughter of Yannis Boukouras, a wealthy aristocrat and entertainer who had opened one of the first theaters in Athens following the Greek War of Independence. Eleni developed an interest in art from a young age. Seeing this, her father hired Italian artist Raffaello Ceccoli as a tutor for his daughter. She continued her studies, and at the age of 27 left for Naples with a letter of recommendation from Ceccoli to begin her education as an artist. While studying in Naples and Florence, she dressed as a man in order to attend art classes. While studying in Italy, Eleni began a relationship with Italian painter Francesco Saverio Altamura, with whom she had three children. She later converted to Catholicism and married Altamura to legitimize the relationship, though her husband would eventually leave Eleni for his mistress, British painter Jane Benham Hay. Eleni and two of her children (her youngest son, Alexander, remained in the custody of her estranged husband) relocated to Athens, where Eleni made a living through painting and teaching art lessons. In 1872 she and her daughter Sophia moved to her family home on Spetses when Sophia contracted tuberculosis. Sophia died of the disease before the end of the year at the age of 18, and so Eleni returned to Athens. In 1876 her son Ioannis, himself a noted seascape painter, finished his studies in Copenhagen and returned to live with his mother in Athens. Just as with his sister before him, Ioannis contracted tuberculosis, succumbing to the disease in 1878. His death cause Eleni to suffer a nervous breakdown; she burned some of her son's paintings along with many of her own works, and retreated from society. At some point she returned to Spetses, where she died in relative obscurity in 1900. = Legacy = Eleni Boukoura is considered one of first great female artists of Modern Greece. The tragedies she experienced in her life were the subject of Greek author Rhea Galanaki's novel Eleni, or, Nobody, which was later adapted into a play.Bien, P. (2004).

A graduate in journalism from the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, she worked in the field of advertising. She lives with her husband and three children in the 7th Congressional District of Virginia. She began and continues to be the administrator of the Facebook page for LWCC, co-ordinating the group's many meetings and events even while undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Chesterfield County, where the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County group of activists is centered, is a populous suburb of the City of Richmond. Since the LWCC group is in the 7th Congressional District, a rural-suburban mix that stretches from Culpeper County to Nottoway County, and since the group membership grew to over 4000 people including some outside the district, it is sometimes called \\"Liberal Women of Chesterfield County - and Beyond.\\" LWCC engages in community volunteerism beyond politics. LWCC members have stocked the high school food go-home pantries of needy teens of Chesterfield County and teamed up with local organization \\"Sylvia Sisters\\" to ensure that needy girls get feminine hygiene products both locally and in Uganda. LWCC advocacy groups ensure that members are given needed supplies, and they volunteer hours to public schools. They also participated in a highway clean-up project,\\"Adopt a Highway\\". The organization Liberal Women of Chesterfield County is creating a national guide, Liberal Women United, a website for branches of similarly- minded women around the United States. Contest between Spanberger and Brat For the mid-term 2018 elections, LWCC focused on the race between Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative, and Rep. Dave Brat (R) which became one of the most competitive in the nation. Committees independent of the candidates lavished \\"$2.2 million on TV and social media ads in the 7th Congressional District, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.\\" An incident of fake signs purporting to be for Spanberger and another incident of the U.S. Post Office sending information that should not have been released occurred in relation to the Spanberger-Brat contest. Brat's campaign issued a defamatory ad against Spanberger calling a school where she briefly taught English \\"Terror High.\\" The Washington Post reported that the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), aired the anti-Spanberger ad that centered on her brief work as a substitute teacher at an Islamic school in Alexandria, Virginia. Post card campaign LWCC members met frequently to write and mail post cards to voters in the 7th Congressional District of Virginia in support of favored candidates throughout the Commonwealth. In 2018's mid-term elections, candidates supported by this program were Scott Miles, Democrat running for Chesterfield County Commonwealth's Attorney; Democratic Senator, Tim Kaine running for re- election; and Abigail Spanberger, Democrat and former CIA officer, opposing in her first run for political office incumbent Dave Brat, U.S. Representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district since 2014, when he defeated Eric Cantor in the Republican primary. The energetic post card campaign, along with door-to-door canvassing, proved successful. Scott Miles, Abigail Spanberger, and Tim Kaine were all elected. ERA After Donald Trump's election in 2016, a group of liberal women in Chesterfield County, Virginia, a traditionally conservative part of the Commonwealth of Virginia, joined together as activists to work for change. CNN's Bill Weir reported on their progress. Members of LWCC support many other active liberal progressive groups addressing issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment. LWCC is not a voting bloc, and efforts are underway to consider and promote the ERA as a non- partisan issue. Candidates Some current and past local and national candidates supported by LWCC members include Abigail Spanberger, Jenefer Hughes, Scott Miles, Wayne Powell, Jack Trammell, Ralph Northam, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Mark Herring, Barack Obama, and Tim Kaine. Democrat Jenefer Hughes challenged incumbent Republican Timothy McPeters in a special election to be Chesterfield Commissioner of Revenue and won by 55% of the vote. ‚ÄúChesterfield County has changed. Chesterfield County is very balanced between Democrats and Republicans. And my election actually reflects that,‚Äù Hughes said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first step to getting fair representation to 2019, when all the local offices come up for election.‚Äù Debates One of the catalysts of activism was Brat complaining that the women were \\"in his grill\\" at public appearances. Abigail Spanberger and Dave Brat debated on October 15, 2018, a debate marked by the fact that Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi 21 times.

United States military occupation of territory comprising today's U.S. state of California came soon after the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846 (the Baja California Peninsula was not occupied until 1847). Occupation replaced the previous system of government under Mexico with a \\"Law of war\\" system centralizing and combining military command and civil governance under a series of military commanders/governors. Existing local government structure, however, was largely left in place. The extent of the governed territory expanded along with US military occupation. Today's state boundaries had not yet been established except for the northern border, set at 42 degrees north latitude by the 1819 Adams-Onis Treaty. Most of the northern and inland areas of today's state were still known only to the indigenous peoples who had lived there for millennia. The military-Mexican hybrid government system was, in turn, replaced in November 1849 by a California Constitution and the first fully elected civilian government. The 1849 constitutional government anticipated that California would soon be accepted as a state into the union of United States of America. However, although the last military governor resigned on December 20 in favor of the first elected governor, California remained a de facto independent state for the next eight-plus months, awaiting acceptance of the statehood petition by the U.S. Congress. The interim government period ended when the Congress approved the California Statehood Act as part of the Compromise of 1850, making California the 31st state on September 9, 1850. Interim governors There were six different military governors during the interim period from 1846 to 1849, followed by one elected civilian governor in 1849-50. * 1846, July 7‚Äì23. United States Navy Commodore John D. Sloat, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. * 1846, July 23. US Navy Commodore Robert F. Stockton arrived to succeed Sloat. * 1847, January 16 ‚Äì March 28. Captain John C. Fr√©mont (de facto, appointed by Stockton) * 1847, March 1. US Army General Stephen Kearny succeeded Stockton, immediately removing Stockton's appointeesincluding Fr√©mont. Kearny ordered his second- in-command, Colonel Richard Barnes Mason, to relieve Fr√©mont, which happened on March 28. * 1847, May 31. Kearny appointed Mason to succeed him as commander/governor. * 1849, February 28. General Percifor F. Smith arrived in San Francisco to assume military command in the Pacific Division, which included California. Smith did not, however, replace Mason as military governor. * 1849, April 13. Brevet Brigadier General Bennett Riley arrived to succeed Mason as military governor. * 1849, December 20. Riley ceded the California governorship to Peter H. Burnett, California's first elected civilian governor. Burnett remained as governor into statehood. Local government On the local level, the military governors left much of the existing Mexican system in place. The top municipal office remained that of alcalde, which combined judicial and administrative functions. The ayuntamiento was an elected advisory body. The juez de pais (justice of the peace) handled minor judicial matters and law enforcement in the towns, and the juez de campo (judge of the countryside) settled rural matters of cattle ownership, branding, etc. For some of the larger settlements, the military governor assigned a lieutenant or non-commissioned officer to be prefecto (similar to a prefect in modern France), as his direct representative. In addition to his appointment of Captain Fr√©mont to be governor, Commodore Stockton appointed a civilian, William H. Russell, as Secretary of State. He also appointed (January 18) a 7-man civilian legislative assembly, which was ordered to convene in Los Angeles on March 1, 1846. Appointees were: Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, David Spence, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Thomas O. Larkin, Eliab Grimes, Santiago Arguello, and Juan Bandini. With Stockton's departure, however, the council idea was dropped and the council never met.Grivas p.93-94 Stockton left no doubt, however, about who was in command. On August 17, he issued a proclamation, stating that \\"...military law will prevail, and the commander in chief will be the governor...\\". He also proclaimed that elections would be held on September 15 for local officials, but he replaced/appointed many prior to that date. All of Stockton's appointees were confirmed by election. Stockton went so far as to write a state constitution, which he sent to Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft for approval, but never proclaimed or published it in California. He was presumably waiting for approval from Washington, which never came because Kearny had already been chosen to take over command. Another Stockton move, in September, was to divide the occupied territory into three military districts. District commanders were assigned, each having authority within their defined geographical areas. Commanders appointed were Captain John B. Montgomery (north); Lt. William A. T. Maddox (central); Captain Archibald H. Gillespie (south).Grivas p.92-93 American alcaldes were confirmed, or new ones appointed, to replace local officials left from Mexican governance whose loyalty to the occupation forces was questioned. Alcaldes appointed by Stockton included: Jonathan Temple and Alexander Bell (Los Angeles); Thomas M. Robbins (Santa Barbara); Antoine Robidoux (San Bernardino); Jos√© Francisco Ortega (a Californio) and John Finch (San Diego); George Hyde (San Jose); Lt. Washington Allon Bartlett and Jos√© de Jes√∫s No√© (Yerba Buena); Walter Colton (Monterey).Grivas p.92-93 Kearny succeeds Stockton On February 8, 1847, Kearny and his troops arrived in Monterey by ship from San Diego. There, Kearny met Stockton's recently-arrived replacement, Commodore William Branford Shubrick. After reading Kearny's orders, Shubrick recognized him as commanding officer on land in California, with Shubrick replacing Stockton as commander of naval forces. Shubrick's authority also included administration of customs and tariffs at ports of entry. Shubrick and Kearny issued a joint circular on March 1, describing this new division of authority.Grivas, p.101 Kearny also found in Monterey some much-needed army reinforcements. An artillery unit (Battery F, 3rd U.S. Artillery) had arrived from New York by sea, shortly after Shubrick. Among its officers were Lt. William T. Sherman, Lt. Henry W. Halleck, and Lt. Edward Ord, who all became important subordinates to Kearny and his army successors.Sherman, volume 1: chapter 2 On the same day, March 1, 1847, General Kearny issued a \\"Proclamation to the People of California\\". Despite its conciliatory tone, it declared, his intention to \\"take charge of the civil government\\".Kearny, p.22 Like his predecessors, Kearny remained a military commander who ran the government of the occupied territory through direct orders, not through civil government processes. Like Stockton, Kearny left local matters largely to locally elected officials operating in the pre- existing Mexican system. Fr√©mont interlude One of the most controversial episodes of this period, occurring immediately after Kearny took command, was the disputed Fr√©mont governorship. Due to a combination of slow communications, overlapping command authority, and the egos of Kearny, Stockton and Fr√©mont, the situation remained unresolved for months. Although Stockton appointed Fr√©mont to be governor on January 16, 1847, the appointment was soon rescinded when Kearny succeeded Stockton in February. Fr√©mont met with Kearny on March 26, and agreed to give up the governorship, but then returned to his Los Angeles headquarters. Only after repeated refusals to meet with his successor Colonel Mason (sent by Kearny to take over military command of the area), which resulted in a near-duel, did Fr√©mont finally give up his office to Mason.Grivas p.77. Details of this incident are from Kearny's testimony during the Fr√©mont court-martial Kearny, angry at the insubordination, later had Fr√©mont arrested and court-martialed. He was found not guilty of mutiny - the most serious charge - but was convicted on several lesser charges related to insubordination, and received a dishonorable discharge from the army. Fr√©mont's career was saved, however, by President James K. Polk. Though stopping short of pardoning Fr√©mont, Polk commuted the sentence and reversed the discharge. Historians remain divided in their opinions of the principals in this episode. Fr√©mont biographer Allan Nevins faulted Fr√©mont for his insubordinate behavior, but contended that Kearny's heavy-handed style was mainly to blame.Nevins (1992 edition), p.314-325 Others see a combination of factors. Fr√©mont was, in fact, convicted of insubordination in a court-martial, by a panel of army officers not involved in the California affair. That much is not in dispute. Historian Theodore Grivas wrote that \\"It does not seem quite clear how Fr√©mont, an army officer, could have imagined that a naval officer [Stockton] could have protected him from a charge of insubordination toward his superior officer [Kearny]\\". Grivas goes on to say, however, that \\"This conflict between Kearny, Stockton and Fr√©mont perhaps could have been averted had methods of communication been what they are today.\\"Grivas p.74-75 Mary Lee Spence and Donald Jackson, editors of a large collection of letters by Fremont and others dating from this period, closely studied these events (including the court-martial), concluding that \\"...in the California episode, Fr√©mont was as often right as wrong. And even a cursory investigation of the court-martial record produces one undeniable conclusion: neither side in the controversy acquitted itself with distinction.\\" Kearny and Mason Recognizing the need for communication with the native Californian peoples, on April 6 Kearny appointed Mariano G. Vallejo and John A. Sutter as Indian sub-agents to treat directly with the indigenes on behalf of the United States. In April 1847, the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, arrived as US Army reinforcements, also replacing the Mormon Battalion, whose members were nearing the end of their one-year enlistments (July 15).Stevenson, p.>29 Kearny split the regiment into three parts - two assigned as district garrisons, and the third assigned to newly occupied territory in the Baja California peninsula. The New York volunteers, under their regular-Army officers, replaced Stockton's departing Navy and Marine detachments. Regimental commander Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson, at Los Angeles, became the southern district commander. Regimental second-in-command Major James A. Hardie, at Sonoma, became the northern district commander. Third-in-command Lt. Col. Henry S. Burton went to Baja California. On May 31, Kearny appointed Colonel Mason to succeed him as military governor, and returned overland to St. Louis, ordering Fr√©mont to accompany him as far as Fort Leavenworth, along with 19 of the remaining 60 regular army soldiers who had accompanied Fr√©mont's third surveying expedition, which had first arrived in California in 1845. At Fort Leavenworth, Kearny had Fr√©mont arrested and ordered to report for court-martial in Washington.Grivas, p.109 One of Mason's first local-government actions demonstrated the absolute authority of the military governor over civil affairs. In June 1847, Mason had to deal with a situation not resolved before Kearny's departure. Kearny had ordered that a locally elected alcalde at Sonoma, John H. Nash, be replaced by Kearny's choice, Lilburn W. Boggs (previously governor of Missouri). Nash and the Sonomans refused, challenging the military governor's authority over local civilian officials. Back at Headquarters in Monterey, Lt. William T. Sherman volunteered to go to Sonoma and bring Nash back to Monterey, so that Mason could explain the situation. This he successfully accomplished, Nash resigned in favor of Boggs, and no further military action was required.Sherman, vol. 1, chapter 2 Soon after, to provide administrative help in California civil affairs, Mason appointed Lt. Sherman as Assistant Adjutant General, and Lt. Henry W. Halleck as Secretary of Statespecializing in legal and land matters. During this time, when the limits of U.S. government authority on the Pacific coast were still unclear, Halleck became an expert in international and maritime law, writing an authoritative book on the subject. California becomes part of the U.S. On February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed (but not announced in California until August 7), officially ending the war. Previously occupied territory under the rules of war, California's legal status changed as part of the lands ceded to the U.S. by the terms of the treaty. As a result of becoming an official part of the US, laws promulgated by the military government in California had to conform to the Constitution. National laws such as tariffs were automatically extended to California, but local municipal laws remained in effect. Another effect of the peace treaty was that most of the soldiers in California, being volunteers, were discharged under the terms of their enlistments, leaving only two companies of regulars in all of California (at some point, a second regular army company had arrived in California, probably detached (as was the first) from Kearny's regiment at Santa Fe). In a letter dated August 18, 1848, military commander/governor Mason stated that his total non-volunteer forces consisted of \\"two companies of regulars...\\".Grivas, p.127 The first volunteer unit to arrive, The Mormon Battalion had already left, as had many members of Fr√©mont's California Battalion, and only the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers remained close to full-strength at war's end. Maintenance of order became even more difficult with the beginning of the California Gold Rush. By the summer of 1848, news of the discovery had reached most of California, and desertion began to be a problem even in the regular military. Colonel Mason conducted an inspection of the gold fields, and sent a report to his superiors in Washington. The publication of Mason's report, on August 17, 1848, announced the discovery to the world, which kicked the California Gold Rush into high gear. With diminishing numbers of troops available to deal with a rapidly increasing population of treasure-hunting immigrants, the New York volunteer regiment's regular Army commander, Colonel Stevenson, attempted to recruit a volunteer militia in Los Angeles to replace some of his departed New York volunteers.Grivas, p.128 State government before statehood By the time Brevet Brigadier General Bennett Riley arrived to succeed Mason (April 13, 1849), who had asked months earlier to be relieved, several of the larger settlements had held un-sanctioned elections, and the gold-rush-induced population growth made the need for statewide law and civilian governance ever more critical. In booming San Francisco, competing groups claimed elected legitimacy, leading Riley, on May 6, to suspend the San Francisco alcalde Thaddeus Leavenworth, who was charged by a newly created and elected \\"Legislative Assembly\\" with maladministration. To help Americans understand the Mexican system of local governance (still in effect), Riley commissioned an English translation of the Mexican laws in effect prior to the warTranslation Learning that Congress had again adjourned for the summer of 1849 without action on California, Riley‚Äîon his own authority‚Äîissued a proclamation calling for a Constitutional Convention. The proclamation outlined the procedures to be followed. Delegates were elected on August 1; a Constitutional Convention was convened in Monterey on September 3; and elections approved the new constitution, a civilian executive, and legislators on November 13.Grivas, p.145 General Riley ceded the California governorship to Peter H. Burnett in his final proclamation on December 20: \\"A new executive having been elected and installed into office, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the State, the undersigned hereby resigns his power as governor of California...\\".Grivas, p.219 With Riley's proclamation, California had a state constitution, a state government, and a state governor, but was not yet a state. During the next nearly eight-plus months of quasi-statehood, the elected government tried to act like a state. Despite previous rumors of brewing revolt against military rule, the elections seem to have largely quashed sentiments to have California remain an independent republic, as Texas had briefly been. Governor Burnett stated that: \\"There was not the slightest ground for the charge that the people of California desired to establish an independent government.\\"Grivas, p.197 In 1850, Congress finally approved California statehood, as part of what became known as the \\"Compromise of 1850.\\" President Millard Fillmore signed the bill into law on September 9, 1850.

The series is narrated by David Attenborough and produced by Silverback Films, led by Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, who also created BBC documentary series Planet Earth, Frozen Planet and The Blue Planet, in collaboration with the conservation charity World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The series addresses issues of conservation while featuring these disparate animals in their respective home regions, and has been noted for its greater focus on humans' impact on the environment than traditional nature documentaries, centering around how climate change impacts all living creatures. It is the first nature documentary Netflix has ever made. All episodes were released on 5 April 2019. A behind-the-scenes documentary was released onto Netflix on 2 August 2019. Netflix reported that 25 million households were expected to watch the series during its first month of release. Production On 15 April 2015, it was announced that the team behind the BBC nature series Planet Earth would produce an eight-part nature docu-series for Netflix that would be released in 2019. It was four years in the making and was filmed in 50 countries, and over 600 crew members took part in the production. The series focuses on the breadth of the diversity of habitats around the world, including the Arctic wilderness, the deep sea, the vast landscapes of Africa and the diverse jungles of South America. In November 2018, David Attenborough was announced as the narrator, with the release date of 5 April 2019 also announced. Promotion The series premiere was held on 4 April 2019, at the Natural History Museum in London. Guests at the premiere included Prince Charles and his two sons Prince William and Prince Harry, Charlie Brooker, David Beckham and his son Brooklyn Beckham, Ellie Goulding and the series narrator David Attenborough, who attended the event to underline their support for action against climate change. In his speech, Prince Charles said he hoped ‚ÄúOur Planet‚Äù would educate hundreds of millions of people around the world about what action was required, while David Attenborough called on the world to \\"be responsible careful citizens of this planet which is our only home, and for the creatures that live in it.\\" The first teaser trailer for \\"Our Planet\\" was released on 8 November 2018. Three months later, on 4 February 2019, the second teaser trailer was released. On 19 March 2019, the official trailer for the documentary was released. Episodes A 1 hour long bonus episode \\"Our Planet - Behind The Scenes\\" about the project is accessible under Additional Videos on Netflix. Reception Keith Scholey discussing Our Planet at the TIFF Bell Lightbox. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93% based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 8.33/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A cornucopia of visual wonder and environmental advocacy, Our Planets breathtaking cinematography explores more of this beautiful, blue marble while presenting an urgent call to action to its inhabitants\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Lucy Mangen of The Guardian gives out 4 out of 5 stars to Our Planet, saying \\"it places clearer emphasis on the fragility and interconnectedness of all the species and eco-systems on display, and on the huge impact humanity has had on them in so short a time. Bryan Resnick of Vox praises the series as \\"can‚Äôt really describe the scale of what‚Äôs missing\\" stating \\"It reminds us we‚Äôre living in an age of staggering wildlife loss due to human development, over- fishing, deforestation, and climate change. This series doesn‚Äôt let us forget that. Humans have caused staggering amounts of wildlife loss. Our Planet doesn‚Äôt hide from it.\\" Ben Travers of Indie Wire give out an overall B+ for the series, and claims that the series ruthlessly contrasts the world's natural wonders with the environmental crisis killing them off, he wrote \\"Their deaths are a warning for the darkness underlying all of Our Planet, a nature docuseries no longer content with passive commentary. It also offers all the stunning imagery you‚Äôve come to expect from these documentarians, but its attitude may surprise you. Individual entries feel a little less memorable because of it. The light, comic touches that made for lovely little moments in Planet Earth are overshadowed, if not spoiled entirely, by the traumatic lessons put front and centre.\\" Will Gompertz of BBC also hands out a 4 out of 5 stars for the series, stating it \\"gives us some of the most dazzling images you are ever likely to view on TV. When necessary, they are embellished with Attenborough's commentary, which is never obtrusive and always written with brevity and wit...It has been created by masters of their craft with an exceptional narrator, I do wonder, though, if the experienced executive producers at BBC would have sharpened up the first episode a little.\\" Stuart McGurk of British GQ said \\"It‚Äôs hard not to see this as a direct rebuke of the BBC‚Äôs nature documentaries: take one well-worn spectacular of the natural world, shoot it even more spectacularly than the BBC ever did and structure your whole opening episode around the idea that, without taking things like global warming seriously ‚Äì without putting it front and centre about any show you‚Äôre making about the natural world, because how could you not ‚Äì then pretty soon they‚Äôll be nothing left to film so beautifully.\\" Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant concluded the series as \\"stunningly ambitious\\", he wrote \\"Where Our Planet excels [Planet Earth and Blue Planet], though, is in its presentation. It‚Äôs not trying to convince anyone of anything ‚Äî the time for doing that is long past. It‚Äôs simply stating this information as fact, in as straightforward a manner as possible. Not that it‚Äôs particularly difficult considering the evidence the series has on hand.\\" However, Ed Power of The Telegraph criticized the documentary series as \\"visually dazzling but very familiar.\\" and gave it a 3 out of 5 stars, writing \\"It is clich√©d in its portrayal of life on earth as a slow motion ballet of tooth and claw....In short, the innovations that made Attenborough‚Äôs previous series so sensational are conspicuously absent. It‚Äôs a haunting vision. More of this and Our Planet might have been a meaningful addition to the canon of natural history series. Instead, it prioritises cinematic grandeur to an almost oppressive degree.\\" Writing in The Independent, Lucy Jones says the most important aspect of the series, which sets it apart from other nature documentaries of its type, is that the harsh realities of global warming, mass species extinction and environmental degradation are woven into the narration that accompanies the breathtaking scenes and imagery, but argues it does not go far enough, and should have been more radical given current ecological crises. In particular, she says the program should have called out those responsible for this ecocide. When Attenburough's narration tells the audience \\"We have destroyed half the forests on earth\\", she retorts \\"But, who is we? As well as the fossil fuel industry, where is the fishing industry? Agriculture? The plastics industry? The vested interests that keep the planet burning? Yes, we are all complicit ‚Äì those of us in affluent societies with high-consumption lifestyles more so than anyone ‚Äì but there are greater powers at work. Describing the scale of the challenge is necessary but I wanted the series to go further, to peer under the hood.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack was released with a compilation of the incidental music specially commissioned for Our Planet. The theme song \\"In This Together\\", which is a collaboration with English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding, is also included. Broadcast Starting from 20 June 2020, the series was aired on Indonesian television network TVRI as a part of Belajar dari Rumah (Study from Home) programming block, made possible by a partnership between the Ministry of Education and Culture and Netflix. The broadcast marked the first Netflix original documentary series ever aired on conventional television, alongside a collection of Netflix documentaries included in the partnership.

The plot revolves around Carmen Eguiluz (Angely Gaviria), a witch and slave from 1646, and is set both in the 17th-century and present-day Cartagena, Colombia. It was ordered direct-to- series, and the first full season premiered on Netflix streaming on January 1, 2019. It was renewed by Netflix for a second season, which aired worldwide on February 28, 2020. The show is dubbed in English for English speakers. Premise In Always a Witch, Carmen Eguiluz (Angely Gaviria) is accused of witchcraft and is set to burn at the stake, according to the way of the Inquisition in 1646 colonial Colombia. While imprisoned and waiting for her execution, Carmen makes a deal with the wizard Aldemar, which makes her able to time-travel to 2019 in exchange for a favor. She won't be able to use magic there though, since it would make Lucien, a powerful but evil wizard, aware of her presence. Reception The series has received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised the show for having a strong black female lead character, others have criticized the slave/slave master romance, and the lead character's willingness to return to the 1600s, thus returning to being a slave, just to be with her white slave master's son.

Over 1,000 people were provided clothing, food and coal. As a result, Battle worked with other local leaders to create United Charities. The organization struggled to secure funding to hire an executive director. Therefore, Battle quit her job teaching in 1886 and served as the nonprofit's secretary-general, a position she would hold until her death in 1924. During her work with United Charities, Battle created a daycare program for the children of working parents. She rented a room in a neighborhood in North Nashville, located near cotton mills that employed women mill workers. Physicians and other professionals provided pro bono services to the growing number of children in the program. Eventually, the program was named the Addison Avenue Day Home, the first daycare in Nashville. Today, it is named the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children. In 1900, Battle created a summer camp for low-income mothers and their children. Located in Craggie Hope, it was named the Fresh Air Camp. Sixteen years later, Battle created a fundraising campaign for the Day Home, during which carolers would perform during the Christmas holiday.  Death and legacy  Battle died in September 1924. Memorial services were held at McKendree United Methodist Church. She was buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery. After Battle's death, the Addison Avenue Day Home was renamed the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children. In 1947, Battle's service in the Confederate Army was memorialized with a plaque at the Confederate Museum. The archives of Battle, and a portrait of her, are held in the Nashville Public Library.

The six-part series was released on 20 March 2020. Premise In the 1870s, football in Great Britain was a sport for the wealthy. A working- class star and his upper-class counterpart come together to change the game forever.

Birgitte St√¶rmose and Tim Fywell are directing, Rory Aitken, Eleanor Moran and Ben Pugh of 42 are executive producing, and Ben Vanstone is co-executive producing. The cast was announced in May 2019 as production began in England, mostly in the North. The first season epilogue reads: \\"In 1885 the FA changed their rules to allow professional players. An amateur team never won the FA Cup again. Arthur Kinnaird became President of the FA, serving 33 years until his death in 1923. Fergus Suter and Jimmy Love are recognised as pioneers of the modern game, which now has over four billion fans across the world.\\" Historical accuracy =Football= After the first couple of episodes the exact dates of events is not explicitly mentioned, though it is suggested that the entire series takes place over just over one season, with Suter winning the cup with Blackburn the year after he joined Darwen. In fact Suter did not win the FA Cup until his sixth season in Lancashire. At the time, Blackburn had two teams: Blackburn Olympic and Blackburn Rovers. The English Game appears to merge the two sides, with the club only ever referred to as \\"Blackburn Football Club\\" or just \\"Blackburn\\" and shown playing in maroon shirts - both Blackburn Olympic and Blackburn Rovers instead played in a combination of blue and white. The maroon colour may have been chosen to differentiate Blackburn from the Old Etonians, who are always shown wearing Eton blue shirts. Blackburn Olympic were the first club of working-class background to win the FA Cup, triumphing in the 1882‚Äì83 season. Of the two teams, Suter in fact joined Blackburn Rovers, with whom he lost the 1882 FA Cup Final 2‚Äì1 against the Old Etonians before winning the cup three times in succession later in the decade. The matches depicted in the show most closely resemble Blackburn Olympic's 1883 victory. Old Etonians' and Blackburn Olympics' matches in the quarter-finals, semis and the final are all referenced accurately except for Old Etonians' quarter-final where they in fact played Hendon, though their stated opponents in the show (Notts County) did make the quarter-finals that season. Darwen are shown as being eliminated from the competition by Derby St Luke's but the Derby club did not actually participate in the FA Cup until the 1884‚Äì85 season, and the two sides never met in a competitive fixture. The first episode depicts Darwen playing just one replay against the Old Etonians in the 1878‚Äì79 FA Cup and losing. In fact, Darwen took the Old Etonians to two replays ‚Äì after the first match was drawn 5‚Äì5, the first replay finished 2‚Äì2 before Old Etonians finally beat them at the third attempt by a score of 6‚Äì2. =Personal= Fergus \\"Fergie\\" Suter and James \\"Jimmy\\" Love joined Darwen separately, with the former joining second in 1878 - Suter was a stonemason, not a mill worker, and would not have come to Darwen to work in a mill. Jimmy Love did not join Darwen to be a paid player, but in fact fled his home in Glasgow when a warrant was put out for his arrest over debts he owed. There is no evidence that he ever joined a Blackburn team permanently, though he did appear for Blackburn Rovers in a friendly against Darwen in 1879. His footballing career was ended in 1880, though not because of a bad tackle but instead as he was recruited into the Royal Marines. Three years later he died of enteric fever while garrisoned with them in Egypt. A recurring storyline in the series is Arthur Kinnaird's failure to have a child and the resulting effects that it has, particularly on his wife who sees child-raising as her raison d'√™tre. In reality, Arthur and his wife had no such problems. They had their first child in 1876, several years before the start of the show, and went on to have another six children over the following quarter of a century, most of whom survived childhood. Alma Kinnaird is shown as having a miscarriage in the second episode, which - though not specified - must have taken place in late 1879. This could not have happened as Alma in fact gave birth to the couple's second child in August of that year. Release A trailer was released on 5 March 2020. Reception On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

It premiered on Netflix on October 12, 2018. The show consists of six episodes and was produced by Netflix, Wilshire Studios and The Henson Alternative, an arm of The Jim Henson Company. The series was not renewed for a second season. Premise The show centers around Christine McConnell, an artist and baker who lives in a mansion full of monsters and ghosts. Accompanied by Rose, Rankle, and Edgar, McConnell loves to create morbid looking desserts like gingerbread haunted houses, caramel spiders and bones made of pretzel sticks, peanut butter and white chocolate. A combination of a DIY show and scripted reality, the show deals with annoying neighbors, relatives, and what to wear on a first date with someone you just met at the cemetery. Characters * Christine McConnell (portrayed by herself) ‚Äì A baker and artist. She feeds and cares for the creatures that live with her. Christine is a kind and warm person, however she lets the creatures plot against the neighbors and each other. * Rose (performed by Colleen Smith) ‚Äì A raccoon who was crushed to death in the back of a garbage truck, but reanimated by Christine. * Rankle (performed by Michael Oosterom) ‚Äì The mummy of an ancient Egyptian cat. Christine found him in an antique store, and read the spell on his burial plate to bring him back to life. * Edgar (body-performed by Mick Ignis, face-performed and voiced by Drew Massey) ‚Äì A werewolf that was left on Christine's doorstep for her to find, and now lives with her. * Bernard (performed by Tim Lagasse) ‚Äì A monster that lives in the basement. Rose confides in him for advice and guidance. * Milly ‚Äì The creature that lives in the refrigerator. Only its tentacles are seen when assisting Christine by passing her items. * Vivienne (portrayed by Dita Von Teese) ‚Äì The ghost of a woman who has been shot by her supposed lover. She lives in the mirror and gives Christine advice on fashion. In the final episode, that takes place during Halloween, Vivienne takes corporal form and goes out on a date with her lover. Viv is shown having various gunshot wounds to her back, while her date has a gunshot wound to the temple, implying their deaths are the result of a murder-suicide committed by the lover. * Cousin Evie (portrayed by Colleen Smith) ‚Äì Christine's insane cousin who is a widowed duchess. She discovers her parents' wills left everything to Christine, and plots to kill her so that she can inherit. * Norman (portrayed by Adam Mayfield) ‚Äì Christine's lover who she meets at the graveyard while visiting her grandmother. He is a serial killer and comes to dinner regularly. * Mr. Ketcham (portrayed by Steven Porter) ‚Äì Christine's grumpy neighbor. He dislikes Christine and often complains about the creatures she lives with. Production Netflix had expressed interest in a goth-inspired series for a long time. McConnell, who already had a large following on Reddit and Instagram, pitched the show to Netflix and Brian Henson. Following the success of Julie's Greenroom, which had been released in early 2017, Netflix expressly wanted the Jim Henson company to produce the show. The company claimed that it was coordinating many other projects, however, Henson Alternative picked up the show. Filming began in early 2017, and the series was released on October 12, 2018. McConnell was principally responsible for editing and post- production. She shot and edited many of the promotional posters herself, and recorded her own voiceovers for the baking segments of each episode. Episodes Reception The show received critical praise for the mixture of retro styling and Gothic aesthetic, use of puppetry, and quirky charm of the series, while pointing out that lack of directions, unfamiliarity with some of the specialist materials used, and the elaborate construction of the creations would mean making them was beyond most home cooks. The New Yorker commented that \\"As cooking lessons, McConnell's demos are almost entirely useless\\", but the show, \\"like her Instagram, is beautiful, morbid, bizarre, and raunchy [and] becomes a wonderfully fantastical take on the classic dump- and-stir cooking show\\". Emma Stefansky of Thrillist also posted a positive review, calling it \\"a perfectly creepy cooking show\\". The Washington Post labelled her creations \\"elaborate dishes that are simultaneously delicious and disturbing\\". The Daily Dot described the series as \\"silly, sly, and utterly charming\\". USA Today listed it as one of their \\"top five best baking TV shows to binge-watch this weekend\\".

In September 2018 she began a lawsuit against her former boyfriend and his employer‚Äîprincipal dancer Chase Finlay and New York City Ballet‚Äîand several other parties, alleging that the individuals named shared sexually explicit images and videos of Waterbury without her consent, and that the institutions named were co-liable.  Early life  Waterbury is from Old Forge, New York. She trained at the School of American Ballet (SAB) in New York City from 2013 to 2016.  Lawsuit against NYCB  In September 2018 Waterbury began a civil action in New York County Supreme Court against NYCB principal dancers Chase Finlay, Amar Ramasar and Zachary Catazaro; NYCB patron Jared Longhitano; New York City Ballet; and SAB. Her lawsuit claimed harm by Finlay for allegedly taking and sharing sexually explicit photos and videos of Waterbury without her knowledge or consent, and by Ramasar, Catazaro, Longhitano, NYCB and SAB for allegedly contributing to that harm in various ways. All defendants disputed key factual allegations made in the complaint as well as their liability as a matter of law; they all filed motions to dismiss. The case is currently pending disposition. Waterbury's lawsuit led to Finlay's resignation and the firing of Ramasar and Catazaro. In April 2019 an arbitrator ordered Ramasar and Catazaro reinstated; Catazaro decided not to rejoin the company. On September 25, 2020, Waterbury's lawsuit was dismissed.

Produced by Fulwell 73 (named as a homage to Sunderland A.F.C. by its founders), the series documents the events around English football club Sunderland A.F.C.. Released on 14 December 2018, the first series documents Sunderland's 2017‚Äì18 season which saw the club playing in the EFL Championship having been relegated from the Premier League the season prior. As a result of the first series success a second series was produced documenting the following season in 2018-19, which coincided with the club's first season under the ownership of Stewart Donald; this was released on 1 April 2020. No plans are currently in place for a third series, though the show's producers have not ruled out the possibility of one in the future.https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/sunderland-til-i-die- season-3-new-series-netflix-documentary-producer-2524898 Overall the show has received positive reviews from critics and fans. Background Sunderland chairman Ellis Short originally agreed to extensive, behind-the-scenes filming in the summer of 2017 on the basis it would attract potential investors. Sunderland had already been the focus of previous fly on the wall documentaries, including the 1998 Premier Passions (which also documented a relegation season) and its 1999 follow-up Premier Pressures. Production company Fulwell 73 (who had previously produced the acclaimed football documentary The Class of '92) had allegedly expressed interest in buying Sunderland in June 2017 shortly before the commencement of filming, but withdrew, citing the demands of their production business. Promoting Sunderland 'til I Die on The Totally Football League Show in December 2018, Pearlman and Turner cast doubt on the veracity of these reports, suggesting there had been: \\"a lot of two plus two equals five going on\\". Speaking on the Roker Report podcast prior to the release of the series, Pearlman and Turner, both Sunderland fans, revealed that they had been trying to produce material for the club for a while and had even offered to produce an end-of-season DVD for free. Filming commenced in June 2017 with the expectation that Sunderland would be challenging for promotion back to the Premier League. Manager Chris Coleman admitted to being uncomfortable with the filming arrangements, which were already in place when he replaced Simon Grayson as manager part way through the season. Coleman described the constant attention as being 'unnatural'. The series does not include a repeat of the memorable, expletive- laden dressing room scenes from Premier Passions, as Coleman explained: \\"The only thing I really dug my heels in about was that I didn't want any filming in my dressing room. That‚Äôs been kept separate.\\" The series culminates with the takeover of the club by Stewart Donald following relegation. A premiere of the first episode took place at the Sunderland Empire Theatre on 5 December 2018. The production company were joined by local media, Sunderland players and staff, and a group of 200 season ticket holders who had been selected from a draw. After the premiere, attendees were shown a trailer for a second series. The opening titles were created by Alchemy Studio, and feature icons from Sunderland's industrial past, with the song \\"Shipyards\\" from the Sunderland-based band The Lake Poets. Filming continued during the 2018-19 season, with a view to producing a second series. Speaking to BBC Sport in February 2019, Turner said that they had received greater access since the change of ownership. Regarding the possibility of a third series, co-producer Leo Pearlman has stated that there are no plans currently in place for one and filming didn't take place during the 2019‚Äì20 season. However, he didn't rule out the possibility of a third series sometime in the future.https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/sunderland-til-i-die-season-3-new- series-netflix-documentary-producer-2524898 Episodes =Season 1 (2018)= =Season 2 (2020) =  Critical reception  Critical response to the series has been positive. Reviewing the series for Sports Illustrated, Luis Miguel Echegaray compared it to All or Nothing: Manchester City and wrote: \\"The project perfectly encapsulates the cultural significance of the city‚Äôs relationship with its proud, working-class supporters. As a result, Sunderland 'Til I Die, despite the club's plight, is a cut above the rest.\\" Writing for The Independent, Alex Hess again drew comparisons to All or Nothing, suggesting that, unlike the \\"weirdly bland affair\\" which followed Manchester City's unrelenting success, the dismal failure of Sunderland's season made for \\"triumphant TV\\". The Newcastle-based Evening Chronicle gave the series a positive five-star review describing it as \\"so much more than just a tale of woe\\" and praising the show's focus on the fans. Writing for The Guardian, Barry Glendenning described it as a \\"wonderful series\\" which: \\"simultaneously showcases everything that is right and wrong with English football.\\" Jack Fox in the Metro states \\"at times it‚Äôs more gory than Game of Thrones but it is a series well worth binging on.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it four out of five stars, and described it as an \\"uplifting story\\", while The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"superb\\". Writing a review for the Sunderland Echo (the local newspaper for the Sunderland area), Phil Smith expressed disappointment at the lack of anything revelatory or explosive in the series, and considered the setup of Sunderland as an area of post-industrial poverty a little forced in the opening episodes. Nevertheless he described it as \\"a beautiful and fundamentally true piece of work\\".

It is endemic to the forest streams of Western Ghats of India. Description and habitat It is a large dragonfly with bottle-green eyes. Its thorax is black, marked with bright yellow. Sides are greenish-yellow traversed by two closely parallel black stripes. Abdomen is black, marked with bright yellow. Fraser described this dragonfly as a race or subspecies of Merogomphus longistigma in 1931. He differentiated it from M. longistigma longistigma by the colour of the occiput and abdominal markings, as well as by its smaller size. The occiput entirely black here whereas greenish yellow in M. longistigrna longistigma. The mid-dorsal spot on segment 3 is isolated, and entirely absent on segments 4 to 6. There is a narrow mid-dorsal stripe in segment 3 to 6 in M. longistigrna longistigma. There is a mid-dorsal tiny diamond-shaped spot on the base of Segment 8. Segments 9 and 10 usually unmarked; but sometimes marked with a fine mid-dorsal streak on 9 and a tiny mid-dorsal apical point of yellow on 10. As advised by D. E. Kimmins, Fraser revised this species in 1953. He figured out that the anal appendages differ rather widely from those of M. longistigma. The anal appendages of M. longistigma are decidedly depressed for the distal half and the apices turn sharply upwards. In M. tamaracherriensis, the base slopes sharply away on the inner side so that the fenestra is diamond-shaped.

Today it is one of the oldest fire stations in Wisconsin. It looks much like it did in 1870 - a gable-roofed building with a hose-drying tower. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History Sauk City's volunteer fire department was established in 1854, after a fire in November destroyed two stores, a tin shop, a house, a cooper shop, a barn and four horses. After this disaster for the small town, a meeting was called to organize a fire department. Charles Spiehr of the German Free Congregation was elected first president, and the fire department was organized into an engine company under J.J. Heller, a hook and ladder company under Charles Deininger, a bucket company under F. Franzel, and a rescue and protection company under Henry Hantzsch. They met at Schneider-Schreiber's Hall, drilled, and resolved that the minutes from that early phase be written in German. By 1859, the department's equipment consisted of a wagon, ladders, J.J. Heller's homemade pump, a large hook for pulling down burning buildings, a small hook, 60 feet of rope, a box to hold the rope, two dozen tin pails, lanterns, five speaking horns, and a record book. With . In 1861 the small fire company heard of a good fire engine available from Milwaukee for $200. They had 80 cents in the treasury at that point, but they ordered it, and proceeded to raise money. (One of the fundraisers was at Stinglehamer's beer hall.) Once the engine arrived, it needed a shed, and some of the firemen proposed another fundraiser on the Fourth of July, but Vice-captain Halasz threatened to resign over that date. (There was a lot of contention in those early years.) Eventually the village provided a half lot and $200, and a brick fire station was built, 11 feet wide by 36 feet deep, with a simple gable roof and no tower. Sections of that 1862 brick station are still present as the south bay of the current building. Also in 1862, a number of members who belonged to Sauk City's rifle company left to fight in the Civil War. This reduced the fire company to the point where it considered disbanding, but the remaining men voted 15 to 12 to continue. In 1870 Sauk City's fire company bought another hand-pumped engine, called \\"the large engine,\\" from the city of Madison. This required more storage space and it was probably at this point that the 1862 brick station was expanded from one bay to two by tearing out the north wall, building a new north wall to expand the hall from 11 feet wide to 28 feet, building a new roof over the old one, and adding the hose-drying tower on the ridge of the new roof. The result probably looked very much like the station looks today, except that the front doors were smaller, topped with segmental brick arches. The square tower stands 15 feet above the roof, including a belfry which holds the station's alarm bell. A shallow dome once topped the belfry, but that has been removed. One of the worst fires in Sauk City's history came shortly after, when the Siebel Bakery on Water Street burned. The Pioneer Press was proud of the work of the fire company: > ...Only the action of the unfailing large fire engine and the brave men who > worked at the pump and water pails with all their strength...we have these > to thank for keeping the fire in control. A light wind from the northeast > turned to the east and blew coals and shingles for a block and one lit the > cupola of the Meyer refrigerator building.... The roof of the Ninman > dwelling was spared but the heat was great. Even against the wind the heat > approached the cottage of Mrs. Ottilie Meyer and they had to keep spraying > it with water and chemical spray. The window broke and the woodwork was > scorched. They carried much of the furniture out of it. ...The family Siebel > lived in the upper part of the building. The youngest child couldn't sleep > and kept Mrs. Seibel awake.

If you look at the > buildings the way they were standing tightly against each other you have to > be surprised the fire could even be brought under control. The large fire > engine was not even, through a misunderstanding, very quick to come to the > place and when they did come, they brought the wrong hose. Still from that > time on until the first stream was placed over the fire you could see there > was no hope in saving it. For three hours the large engine was used without > stopping.

Now that people see > what great danger we stand in with our old-fashioned and impractical water > works, there is talk again about a new water works system. Now let us keep > the ball rolling and vote on it...\\" By 1900 the fire station was expanded again by moving a wooden building up against its back end. Around that time, the station contained two iron cages that served as the village jail. The village had no other municipal buildings for years, so that rear section was used for meetings of the village board, for other meetings, and as a polling place until 1937 when the village made the Curtis Hotel into a city hall with help from the Works Progress Administration. The little station bought its first motorized truck in 1924, a Grass-Premier truck built right in Sauk City. This truck is probably what forced them to enlarge the north door. They bought a second Grass-Premier truck in 1928. In 1954 the new fire station was built on Madison Street, and the old station stood idle for a decade. In 1963 the building was renovated a bit and converted to a community museum. In 1994 the Sauk Prairie Area Historical Society leased the building, tore down the sagging rear addition, and raised money to repair the roof and tower. The building now houses a museum displaying historic firefighting equipment.

Career He was born in Southport, Connecticut on March 24, 1802. He was the son of Barnabas Lothrop Sturges (1769‚Äì1831) and Mary (n√©e Sturges) Sturges (1771‚Äì1840). His older sister, Mary Ann Sturges, was the wife of William Lockwood and his brother, Lothrop Sturges, was the husband of Jane Freeman Corry. His paternal uncle and grandfather, Lewis Burr Sturges and Jonathan Sturges, were both U.S. Representatives from Connecticut, and his maternal grandparents were Hezekiah Sturges and Abigail (n√©e Dimon) Sturges. Career Kindred Spirits, commissioned by Sturges as a gift for William Cullen Bryant in gratitude for the nature poet's eulogy to Thomas Cole. Sturges' father had a failed business (he built a vessel which was captured by the French on its first voyage), so, after receiving a \\"liberal education\\", in 1821, Jonathan went to New York City and worked as a clerk in Luman Reed's grocery business at 125 Front Street. Eventually, in 1828, became a one-third partner in the reorganized firm of Reed, Hemstead Sturges, followed by senior partner upon the death of Reed in June 1836. Reed was Sturges' introduction to arts patronage. Sturges retired from \\"mercantile pursuits\\" in 1868 and left the business in the hands of Benjamin G. Arnold, the founding president of the Coffee Exchange in the 1880s. With the success of his mercantile business, he moved into other enterprises. He was a founder and director of the Bank of Commerce of New York, a founder and director of the Illinois Central Railroad, and a shareholder in the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He helped found the Union League Club of New York and became its second president in 1863. =Arts patronage= A View of the Mountain Pass Called the Notch of the White Mountains, by Thomas Cole, 1839. Sturges became an important American patron of the arts, acquiring Luman Reed's collection with a group following Reed's death in 1836. He commissioned numerous paintings from American artists, such as Kindred Spirits, a tribute to Thomas Cole by Asher Brown Durand; Durand also made portraits of the Sturges family. The group created the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts for Reed's collection, which eventually went to the New York Historical Society. Sturges patronized other American artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, Henry Inman, William Sidney Mount, John Gadsby Chapman, Henry Kirke Brown, Henry Peters Gray, Charles C. Ingham, and Robert W. Weir. In Henry Tuckerman's 1867 Book of the Artists, Sturges' art collection was included as one of the ten most significant private art collections in New York City. Personal life Sturges House in Fairfield, Connecticut. The late Jonathan Sturges, a celebrated merchant and citizen of New York, 1861- On October 25, 1828, Sturges was married to Mary Pemberton Cady (1806‚Äì1894), the daughter of Ebenezer Pemberton Cady (a grandson of Ebenezer Pemberton) and Elizabeth Smith Cady. Together, they had a house in New York City and a summer residence on Mill Plain Road in Fairfield, a Gothic Revival home designed in 1840 by English architect Joseph Collins Wells, today known as the Jonathan Sturges House (the property remains in the family). Mary and Jonathan were the parents of five children, including: * Virginia Reed Sturges (1830‚Äì1902), who married railroad executive William H.

Biography  = Early life = David Musuguri was born on 4 January 1920 in Butiama, Tanganyika. In 1938, he underwent bhakisero, a traditional rite of passage for Zanaki males involving the filing of the top incisors into triangular shapes. = Military career = In 1942, Musugiri enlisted in the King's African Rifles (KAR), beginning as a private. He later served with the KAR in Madagascar. By 1947 he was a sergeant and acted as an instructor at Kahawa Barracks in Nairobi, Kenya. While there he met future Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who was a pupil of his. In 1957, the British administration introduced the rank of effendi into the KAR, which was awarded to high performing African non-commissioned officers and warrant officers (it was not a true officer classification). Musuguri was given the rank. In December 1961, Tanganyika became a sovereign state and several units of the KAR was transferred to the newly formed Tanganyika Rifles. The rank of effendi was shortly thereafter abandoned, and, by 1962, Musuguri had been promoted to lieutenant. During the Tanganyika Rifles mutiny of January 1964, Musuguri was stationed in Tabora. Rebellious troops, attempting to remove and replace their British officers, declared him a major. Though reportedly illiterate, Musuguri eventually rose to the rank of brigadier by 1978. In early 1979, he was promoted to major general and given command of the Tanzanian People's Defence Force (TPDF)'s 20th Division, a force that had been assembled to invade Uganda following the outbreak of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War in 1978. During the war, he garnered the nom de guerre \\"General Mutukula\\", and successfully commanded his forces during the battles of Simba Hills, Masaka, and Lukaya, as well as Operation Dada Idi. In 1980, Musuguri was appointed Chief of the TPDF. On 30 December, President Julius Nyerere promoted him to lieutenant general. On 7 February 1981, Ugandan President Milton Obote gave Musuguri two spears in honor of \\"his gallant action in the Battle of Lukaya\\". During his tenure, he was accused of encouraging ethnic favoritism in the armed forces. He was opposed to withdrawing Tanzanian troops from Uganda in 1981 on the grounds that the country had not yet built a reliable armed force, but Nyerere overruled him. His retirement was announced on 31 August 1988. = Later life = Following his retirement, Musuguri moved to Butiama. In 2002, he endorsed the creation of an East African federation between Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. In 2014, he was awarded the Order of the Union Third Class by President Jakaya Kikwete. On 4 January 2020, he celebrated his 100th birthday.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. John Bowman (1763-1825) arrived in NSW in 1798 and settled at Richmond, farming the property \\"Archerfield\\" which he received as a grant of 100 acres on 8 April 1799. He came from England as a free settler under certain encouraging conditions.Baker et al, 1967, 51 Bowman quickly identified himself with the cause of free settlers on the Hawkesbury, opposing the monopolistic practices of the New South Wales Corps and supporting stable government as administered by Governors William Bligh and Lachlan Macquarie. The settlers submitted various petitions and addresses from time to time to the Governors, particularly to Bligh, and even wrote to Viscount Castlereagh, Colonial Secretary in England, plainly stating their case against the military faction. Their efforts were rewarded by the instructions given to Macquarie to give help and encouragement to the smaller settlers, and by the decline of the influence of the military during his governorship. After Bligh was deposed by the Rum Rebellion, the Hawkesbury settlers still persisted in supporting the deposed Governor and stating their claims, and fourteen of them, including Bowman, sent off the 1809 memorial to Viscount Castlereagh stating that they had no hand in the rebellion.Baker et al, 1967, 52 Under Macquarie, who replaced Bligh from 1 January 1810, the colony prospered. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. In December 1810, he proclaimed the five Macquarie Towns in the Hawkesbury Region, including Richmond. As a result, the locality became more permanent, with streets, public buildings, and a town square (Richmond Park). When Macquarie had brought stability to the colony, and regained respect for the administration, Bowman concentrated on farming pursuits. John Bowman was promised land (the site that would become Toxana) by Macquarie.Kass, 2008, 3 In 1821 he commenced building a house on Richmond's main street, now 367 Windsor Street. He died on 16 December 1825, and left his house to his son, George Bowman, who lived until 1878 and concerned himself with farming and grazing stock on the Hunter River, as well as with public affairs, being elected to the new Parliament of New South Wales in 1851. John and Honor Bowman had four children and their son William is listed in the 1828 census as having 300 acres at Richmond, with 137 of these cleared and 130 cultivated. He also had four horses and two horned cattle at this time. In the 1830s William Bowman (the fourth and youngest child of John) became interested in the promotion of free immigration to the colony. He left for a two-year visit to England in 1836, and married Elizabeth Arthur there. In 1837, to sponsor immigrants, he signed an agreement with John Marshall, captain of the ship City of Edinburgh, to pay for the passage of twelve married couples from London to Sydney. William Bowman was granted the site of Toxana, in Windsor Street, Richmond between Market and Toxana Streets, 1830s. H. F. White's 1836 survey of Richmond shows six buildings on Bowman's land, all of which pre-date Toxana. A garden and a series of sheds were shown on the future site of Toxana.Kass, 2008, 3-4 Toxana's construction dates are the subject of conflicting sources, but the building's heritage listing notes that recent research suggests its construction dates were probably 1843-4. There is some dispute as to the identify of Toxana's builder, some claiming it was (carpenter) George Marlin and others asserting brick layer James Melville was the builder. Sam Boughton writing under pseudonym of \\"Cooramil\\" in the early 20th century claimed that George Marlin built it after coming under contract from England with his family. Marlin and family settled in Richmond afterwards. George C Johston writing under pseudonym \\"Cooyal\\" disputed whether it was built by Marlin and claimed the builder was James Melville. Johnston had heard from Melville himself that he had done the brickwork on Toxana and seen Melville's receipts for sand and other materials for the work. \\"Cooramil\\" replied agreeing Melville completed the brickwork, and remembered him working there. It appears that about 1842, James Melville and George Martin/Marlin (who had done the carpenter's and joiner's work with his three sons George Jr., Phil and Jack) erected Toxana for Bowman.Kass, 2008, 5-6, altering Baker, 1967, 54 William Bowman, along with his older brother George, played a major role in the development of the district, involved in pastoralism and farming and prominent in public affairs. He also owned several properties in the Bathurst district and was involved in wine-growing. Toxana was a substantial town house erected at the height of the 1840s boom before depression meant straitened circumstances for many of the pastoral elite of the colony. It represents an expression of optimism in a time of boom. William Bowman died at Richmond on 11 December 1874 and is buried in St Peter's graveyard. The property was left to his wife Elizabeth, who lived there until her death on 25 November 1885. It passed to Ann Catherine Cadell, widow of Thomas Cadell. On 5 January 1881 Cadell (of Mullanmuddy, near Mudgee) mortgaged her life estate under Bowman's will to Thomas Forster Knox of Sydney and Henry Edward Augustus Allan, merchant of Sydney for 3 years. This included various land parcels, but not Toxana. There were doubts whether it did include Toxana in some later legal transactions. Eliza Sophia Cameron, n√©e Bowman, wife of Rev. James Cameron died on 27 January 1886. In that year Ann Cadell agreed to sell Toxana and 8 acres of land in Windsor Street to Rev. Cameron for 5000 pounds if she could get the agreement of all the children affected. This was done and she signed a conveyance of the land on 17 June 1886. The land consisted of two lots: the first 4 acres 3 roods 24 perches on which Toxana sat and the second was part of lot 2 section 11.Kass, 2008, 7-8 Toxana became the property of the Rev. James Cameron (bought in 1886, releasing the mortgage from Cadell). He was later Moderator-General of the Presbyterian Church in Australia. Photographs from 1888 show the front of Toxana obscured by a large jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) tree on the eastern side and an even larger pair of trees on the western side - these appear to be a silky oak (Grevillea robusta) and a Southern nettle tree/ hackberry (Celtis australis). The front fence at this time was a low masonry wall, with stone pillared gate posts; a wrought iron and \\"crinkle wire\\" gate; and low wrought iron balustrade (possibly infilled with wire mesh) atop the masonry wall - the whole below 1m high. In 1891 it was leased by the newly set up Hawkesbury Agricultural College to provide temporary accommodation for its students, who (25 students originally) took up occupation on 10 March 1891. The College was officially opened on 16 March 1891, a photoHawkesbury Agricultural College Gazette, 31 October 1907, 203 shows the Ministerial party and others on Toxana's front steps.Kass, 2008, 8 An 1891 photo showing the view up Windsor Street from Toxana's upper verandah showed some details of its timber picket, apparently white fence, and what appear to be two Mediterranean cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens) in the front western-half garden. Meals were served in the basement and lectures held in the eastern front verandah room. The rest of Toxana was used for student accommodation. In 1892 meals were taken at Toxana (soon known as the No. 1 College) in the large double first floor room, whilst the front half of that room was used as the first lecture room. The college's work horses were housed in the stables behind Toxana. The College's Ayrshire bull was kept in the \\"Toxana paddock\\" and a rough dairy operated in old sheds behind Toxana, where primitive conditions hampered production, halted the manufacture of cheese most of the time and blighted students with fleas. In October 1891 some students moved out of Toxana into Towns' house known as No. 2 College). In 1896 all students moved into the purpose-built college erected on the College site in Ham Common (south-east of the town).Kass, 2008, 9 The College gave scientific and practical training to aspiring young farmers, and had acquired land just out of Richmond. A heavy wind was recorded as having blown down the upper verandah of No. 1 College (Toxana) on 16 August 1892. When a water supply was turned on for Richmond on 27 October 1892 Toxana began to receive a piped water supply replacing the earlier supply from tanks on its roof. Early in 1893 a bee farm was established in the walled-in garden behind Toxana and remained there until moved in 1894. A photoR.N.Dart, Hawkesbury Agricultural College: History and Reminiscences, 12 shows staff and students on Toxana's front steps in 1894. Cameron applied to bring Toxana's land under Torrens Title on 6 October 1893. He noted that it was leased to the Department of Mines and Agriculture and used as an agricultural college. A certificate of title was issued to him for 7 acres 3 roods 9 perches on 22 January 1894. It was replaced on 24 April 1899 by a new certificate of title for 7 acres 3 roods 22 perches to take account of the amended area after the new survey.DP 59196Kass, 2008, 11-12 A draft conservation plan for Toxana prepared by Graham Edds & Associates provided a series of historic photographs over the life of the building which reveal change in the landscaping of the forecourt since 1842. The earliest photograph located to date appeared in the Hawkesbury Agricultural College Journal of 1907. A photo from the 1890s or 1900s from the Woodhill collectionHawkesbury Ccl. Local Studies Collection, image 7088 shows a masonry low balustrade and iron picket fence, with masonry pillars had replaced the earlier timber pickets. This photo also clearly shows the large jacaranda and silky oak trees part-obscuring the house's street front. Cameron died on 8 September 1905. Toxana was then leased to \\"Head Quarters 3rd Australian Infantry Regiment\\" at 75 pounds per annum, and estimated to be worth 2000 pounds including the land value according to valuer C.S.Guest. Richmond was the headquarters of the 3rd Australian Infantry Regiment and Guest, who happened to be the unit's commander, as Lt. Col. Charles Septimus Guest. He was Mayor of Richmond from 1906-07.Kass, 2008, 13 Title passed to the Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. as executor of Cameron's will on 24 February 1906. E. H. Cowdery surveyed the land for auction sale in 10/1906. Auction of the Toxana Estate, with its surrounding land divided into 25 lots was held on 3 November 1906. Toxana stood on a triple lot (Lot 7) aside three lots to its east facing WIndsor Street. Toxana's lot 7, plus lots 6 (immediately to its north) and 10 (the south-eastern corner lot facing Windsor Street) were transferred to George Edward Woodhill of Richmond, store keeper, with the certificate of title issued to him on 18 April 1907. The property was converted into and leased as flats, though the date of conversion is unknown.Kass, 2008, 15; Baker., 1967, 55 On 8 January 1920 part of lot 7 (15.75 perches) at the corner of Windsor and East Market Street was sold to James Timmins Jr., of Richmond, butcher and a new certificate of title was issued to George Woodhill, then living at Coogee, store keeper, for lot 10 DP 4906 and lot 6 and part of lot 7 (containing Toxana).Kass, 2008, 16 On 15 April 1921 Lot 6 and part lot 7 (containing Toxana) DP 4906 totalling 3 roods 6.75 perches were transferred to John Mulvena of Richmond, chemist and a new certificate of title was issued to him on 14 September 1921. A mortgage of 15 April 1921 to George Woodhill of Coogee, store keeper was discharged on 17 March 1923. A survey of the land for subdivision dated show of 23 October 1934ed no detail of buildings. After two parcels of land, part of that property, were transferred in 12/1934 a new certificate of title was issued on 22 February 1935 to Mulvena, who was then living in Marrickville. On 7 May 1942 during the World War II the combined ministers of Richmond requested that the Army lease Toxana for a service club to be operated by the combined churches.Kass, 2008, 16-17 When the property was examined on 8 May, it was occupied by \\"Kellie\\". The owner was Chandos Scouller of Glamis Park, North Richmond. The upper flat was occupied by Leading Aircraftsman Stocks of the RAAF and his wife. RAAF headquarters requested that Stocks be allowed to remain due to the rapid expansion of Richmond air base and the difficulty of obtaining accommodation. Stock's flat had a separate entrance so the lower floor could be used as a club. The lease was never implemented. After the death of Scouller, the property passed to the Perpetual Trustee Co. on 31 May 1960, who transferred it to Isabel Valentine Scouller of North Richmond, spinster on 24 August 1971.Kass, 2008, 19 In 1978 Toxana was bought by Windsor Municipal Council for $75,000 and restored at a cost of $179.500 with assistance from the Commonwealth Government grants program. The formal transfer to the Council was signed on 29 November 1978 and it was mortgaged to Isabel Scouller until discharged on 29 November 1979. A series of photographs from before 1978 are held at the Hawkesbury City Library's local studies collection and document the state of the building before conservation work commenced. Another series of photographs held in HCL's local studies collection document the 1978 restoration works to the building.Kass, 2008, 20 Fisher Lucas Architects were engaged by Council to prepare documentation for the building and forecourt restoration. Council staff supervised the works. The former forecourt planting was removed and replaced as part of these works. Some of the original front fence was removed/relocated during works. A jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) tree in the eastern portion of the forecourt was retained. Photographs show another jacaranda on the west of the house. A March 1979 garden plan and fence details prepared by Fisher Lucas confirms that the subject sweet bay/ bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) were planted as part of the replacement forecourt garden. With the exception of the Queensland. black bean (Castanospermum australe) and date palm (Phoenix sp.) still within the rear yard, none of the former mature trees indicated on that plan (figure 1-4) or noted on the detail drawing (figure 1-5) below are extant in 2013.Edds, 2013, 3-5 Toxana was given a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage Act on 23 July 1979 and entered on the Register of the National Estate on 21 October 1980. On 2 April 1999 it was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. By 29 November 1979 the property was leased to the Commonwealth of Australia. A lease of rooms 1, 3-5 and 7 of the ground floor to the Commonwealth of Australia followed on 9 October 1981. On 18 June 1988 the basement was leased to Paul James Clarke, Malcolm James Dahmes and Graham Allen Paull. Unspecified works were undertaken by Council in the 1990s, apparently in the roof space.Kass, 2008, 28  Description  Toxana is on a lot facing Richmond's main street, near its main intersection and Richmond Park. The site has a set back from the street with a front garden, behind a masonry pier and iron palisade fence. At the rear is a driveway and car parking area. Toxana has outstanding Regency and Georgian detailing. It is a substantial two storey house with iron-work balustrading and open iron columns on the first floor, while the ground storey has tapered round timber columns.

He is the founder of three golf schools, and is now the senior director of instruction for Trump Golf Properties. Wiren is a member of both the PGA Hall of Fame and the World Golf Teachers' Hall of Fame. As an author, he has written fourteen books, and Wiren is also the founder of Golf Around the World. Education and early life Born in 1935, Wiren became an all-state golfer in high school while playing in Omaha, Nebraska. He then attended Huron University in South Dakota, where he played quarterback for the football team and was named an All-American. He also played golf for the college, winning the conference championship. He then received his master's degree in Sport Science from the University of Michigan, and his PhD from the University of Oregon. In 1962, during the completion of his doctorate, he began teaching golf at a local community course. He later received an honorary doctorate from Ferris State University in Michigan. Golf playing career Wiren competed in the 1994 U.S. Senior Open, and in two additional events on the Senior PGA Tour. He has also competed in professional long-ball driving tournaments from the 1970s into the 2010s, and regional PGA championships. His titles have included the South Florida PGA Seniors title and the South Florida long-driving championship. Golf instruction career Wiren was the chairman of the Pacific Northwest PGA in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1972, he relocated to Florida, becoming the Director of Education, Learning, and Research for the PGA of America, a position he held for fourteen years, leaving in 1985. He also founded The Five Star Golf School at the Boca Raton Hotel and Club, The PGA Jr. National Academy, and Golf Discovery Schools for the PGA of America. In 1976, Wiren introduced the \\"Laws, Principles, and Preferences\\" of teaching a full golf swing, as a member of a group of instructors working with the National Golf Foundation. The \\"laws\\" in the model refer to how physics affect the connection of the club face and the ball. The five factors included are clubhead path, clubface position, clubhead speed, angle of approach, and centeredness of contact. The \\"principles and preferences\\" refer to how the individual golfer swings the club in order to strike the ball‚Äîincluding choices in the swing regarding physical and emotional states, as well as where the ball is intended to go. His \\"principles\\" are separated into \\"pre-swing principles\\" (the grip, aim and alignment, and setup) and \\"in-swing principles\\" (swing plane, width of arc, length of arc, position of target arm and wrist, lever system, timing, release, dynamic balance, swing center, connection, and impact). \\"Preferences\\" are developed based upon the individual golfer during instruction. Wiren added to the ball flight laws by contributing the concept of centeredness of contact. Following his time with the PGA, Wiren continued instructing for private companies as a PGA Master Professional instructor. He also spent several years hosting a golf instruction television show in Japan, and spent seventeen years as head of the Mizuno Golf Schools in that country. He has also appeared in segments on ESPN and The Golf Channel. In the 1990s, he became the senior director of instruction for all Trump Golf Properties, operating out of Trump International in West Palm Beach, Florida. It is estimated that he has taught more than a quarter-million students over his career, in 32 countries. Businesses Wiren is the founder of Golf Around the World, which is a business that tests and sells golf teaching and training aids, and issues reviews and recommendations on each. He is also the developer of the \\"Impact Bag\\" golf training aid, which measures the feel of the moment of impact.

Kepler 1625b I, a possible moon of exoplanet Kepler-1625b, may be the first exomoon ever discovered (pending confirmation), and was first indicated after preliminary observations by the Kepler Space Telescope. A more thorough observing campaign by the Hubble Space Telescope took place in October 2017, ultimately leading to a discovery paper published in \\"Science Advances\\" in early October 2018. Studies related to the discovery of this moon suggest that the host exoplanet is up to several Jupiter masses in size, and the moon is thought to be approximately the mass of Neptune. There is a possibility that the large exomoon may have a moon itself, called a subsatellite. Kepler-1625b I may be habitable, considering the host planet has an equilibrium temperature of . The original paper presented two independent lines of evidence for the exomoon, a transit timing variation indicating a Neptune-mass moon, and a photometric dip indicating a Neptune-radius moon. An independent re-analysis of the observations published in February 2019 recovered both but suggested that an inclined and hidden hot-Jupiter could also be responsible, which could be tested with future Doppler spectroscopy radial velocity observations. A third study analyzing this data set recovered the transit timing variation signature but not the photometric dip, and thus questioned the exomoon hypothesis. The original discovery team later addressed this paper, finding that their re-reduction exhibits higher systematics that may explain their differing conclusions.

It is believed that this was the first instance in NSW of the use of this material for such load carrying purposes. = Modifications and dates = Substantially as designed, but with an increase in height of the crest of with post tensioning anchors undertaken in 1989 as part of interim flood mitigation works.  Heritage listing  As at 22 March 2001, Megarritys Bridge is considered to be of high significance as it serves the function of carrying the major Warragamba pipeline across Megarritys Creek. It is historically associated with the Warragamba Emergency Scheme, and at the time of construction, was one of the largest concrete arch bridges to be built in NSW. It is a unique item of engineering heritage as its design is based on an innovative \\"bow string\\" arch design rather than the more common \\"decked\\" arch design. Megarritys Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare statewide.

Fong (; 1930 ‚Äì October 3, 2018) was a Chinese-American historian of East Asian art. He was the Edwards S. Sanford Professor of Art History at Princeton University, where he taught Chinese art history for 45 years. In 1959 he co-founded the first doctoral program in Chinese art and archaeology in the United States, which was later expanded to include Japan. He served as chairman of Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, and as consultative chairman for Asian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  Early life and education  Fong was born in Shanghai in 1930. As a child he studied under the calligrapher Li Jian (; 1881‚Äì1956). Fong held his personal calligraphy exhibition at the age of 10 and was acclaimed as a prodigy. He enrolled at Shanghai Jiao Tong University before moving to the United States to study at Princeton University in 1948. At Princeton Fong studied under Kurt Weitzmann and George Rowley, and earned his B.A. in European history and M.F.A. in medieval art history. In 1954, he joined the faculty of Princeton while still studying for his Ph.D., which he received in 1958. His Ph.D. dissertation on the history of Chinese art was published by the Freer Gallery of Art as The Lohans and a Bridge to Heaven (1958).  Career  In 1959, Wen Fong and Frederick W. Mote co-founded the first doctoral program in Chinese art and archaeology in the United States, which was expanded to include Japan in 1962. From 1970 to 1973, he served as Chair of Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology. He was a curator at the Art Museum of Princeton University for Asian art, and helped build the John B. Elliott Collection of Chinese Calligraphy, considered one of the best outside of China. In 1971, he was named Edwards S. Sanford Professor of Art History. He retired from Princeton in 1999, after a 45-year career. He subsequently taught at Tsinghua University from 2004 to 2007 and Zhejiang University from 2009 to 2012. From 1971 to 2000, Fong also served as a special consultant, and later consultative chairman, for Asian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the Met, he had an influential debate with art historian James Cahill over the authenticity of The Riverbank, a famous 10th-century painting attributed to the Southern Tang master Dong Yuan. It was purchased and donated to the museum by the financier Oscar Tang, Fong's brother-in-law. Cahill made an explosive argument that the painting was a fake created by the 20th-century master painter and forger Zhang Daqian, while Fong disagreed with his finding. The dispute remains unresolved. Despite their disagreement, Cahill made a presentation praising Fong's scholarship and friendship at a 2006 Princeton symposium held in Fong's honor. Fong also served as Corresponding Research Fellow at the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica in Taiwan and was elected as an academician of Academia Sinica in 1992.  Personal life  In the 1950s, Fong married Constance Tang Fong (), whom he had met at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. They had three children: Laurence, Peter, and Serena. Peter suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and killed a sushi chef in San Francisco in 2009. He pleaded guilty for murder, and was sentenced in 2013 to life in a mental hospital. On October 3, 2018, Fong died in Princeton, New Jersey, of leukemia, aged 88.

It was formed on 5 November 1973 by the amalgamation of the Westmead Teachers' College, which had opened in 1969, and the under-construction Kingswood College of Advanced Education, which had only been incorporated that March. It had two campuses: one at Kingswood and one at Westmead, the latter divided into two sites 500 metres apart. It initially operated from the Westmead campus while construction continued on the Kingswood campus, which eventually opened in February 1977. It expanded beyond its original teaching offerings, introducing a School of Business in 1976, and offering its first degree qualification, a Bachelor of Business, in 1977; a diploma of visual and performing arts was also introduced by 1980. A co-operative program in applied science, conducted in partnership with the New South Wales Institute of Technology, was established in the 1980s. By 1984, it had four divisions: the School of Business, School of Teacher Education, School of the Arts and Centre for Applied Science, and a student population of about 2,100, rising to 2,900 in 1986. A School of Nursing opened in 1984. The college acquired the former St Vincent's Boys' Home at Westmead in 1985; thereafter the previous Westmead campus became \\"Westmead South\\" and the new buildings \\"Westmead North\\". In 1986, the college purchased additional land at Westmead from the Marist Brothers, after which it sold the original (\\"Westmead South\\") campus, which was now in a deteriorating state, to the Department of Education. In the years prior to its amalgamation, it faced conflict over various merger proposals and problems caused by rapidly rising demand in Western Sydney for its courses met with inadequate funding. A shortage of campus space had forced it to lease commercial premises to accommodate 100 visual arts students. By its final year, 1988, it was being threatened with losing its Australian Society of Accountants accreditation due to severe staff shortages. In 1985, Premier Neville Wran initiated a Higher Education Board inquiry into higher education in Western Sydney, headed by Ron Parry. The report recommended the amalgamation of the Nepean College of Advanced Education and the Hawkesbury Agricultural College to form a new university. The state government gave effect to the report's recommendations in the University of Western Sydney Act 1988, and the college formally amalgamated into the new University of Western Sydney from 1 January 1989. It thereafter became the university's Nepean campus in UWS' federal structure.

Discovery The sword was discovered on 9 April 1976 by nine-year-old Gary Fridd on the north side of Gilling Beck, in Gilling West, North Yorkshire. At the Coroner's inquisition for treasure trove, held in September of the same year, a police officer identified the find spot as \\"33 feet east of a bridge and two feet from the water's edge\\". He also identified that a mechanical extractor had recently been working in the area where the sword was found, offering a reason for its unusual discovery. The sword was not declared treasure and became the property of the finder. The finder appeared on the children's television programme Blue Peter to talk about his discovery and both he and the sword were awarded Blue Peter badges. The sword was purchased at auction by the Yorkshire Museum in 1977. Description Detail of the decoration on the hilt The whole sword measures in length, with a maximum width of across the guard. The sword blade is bifacial (double edged) and the hilt is decorated in silver with a combination of geometric and floriate (depicting flowers, leaves and foliage) designs. The blade itself measures in length from the guard. It tapers gradually from the guard, where it measures wide. The blade has a shallow fuller along its length and traces of pattern-welding are visible on its surface. The pommel is decorated with strips of silver and five matching strips are visible across the grip. Significance The form and decoration of the Gilling sword places it within a group of late Anglo-Saxon swords classified as 'type L'; regarded as typical Anglo-Saxon swords of the Viking period and it has been compared to a similar example from Fiskerton, Lincolnshire. The sword may originally have derived from a grave, which had been disturbed by the mechanical excavator mentioned in the Coroner's report. Public display The Gilling sword on display in the Yorkshire Museum in 2010 The sword is in the collection of the Yorkshire Museum. It appeared in the exhibition \\"The Vikings in England\\", which was opened by the Prince of Wales on 30 March 1982 and was seen by over 235,000 visitors before it closed in October of the same year. This exhibition was awarded the European Museum of the Year Special Exhibition Award as a result of the presentation of the exhibition in the Museum and for additional educational projects organised by the curator Elizabeth Hartley. When the Museum was closed in 2010 for a major refurbishment, the Gilling sword (along with the other key objects from the Museum) were displayed at the British Museum. It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for the new exhibition opening on 1 August 2010. In 2013 it was included in the permanent medieval exhibition \\"Capital of the North\\". From 2017 it formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the Vale of York Hoard and the Cuerdale Hoard, with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum and subsequently including Atkinson Art Gallery and Library in Southport, Norwich Castle Museum, and the University of Nottingham. The sword went back on display at the Yorkshire Museum in September 2019.

Right off of the main street Jalan Malioboro, Beringharjo Market is officially located on Jalan Margo Mulyo No. 16, Yogyakarta. The word beringharjo literally means \\"banyan tree forest\\", a reference to the former trees that occupied the land, as well as to the notion that the market was expected to provide welfare for Yogyakarta residents. The stalls at Beringharjo Market sell a variety of goods, including batik, clothing, souvenirs, fast food, jajanan pasar (market snacks) (id), basic ingredients, household items, jamu (traditional herbal medicine), and antiques. History The Beringharjo area was originally a banyan forest. Not long after the establishment of the Kraton in 1758, the area began to be used for transactions by residents of Yogyakarta and the surrounding areas. On 24 March 1925, the Keraton tasked the Nederlandsch Indisch Beton Maatschappij (Dutch East Indies Concrete Company) with building market stalls, and by the end of August 1925, eleven had been installed, with and others soon following. By the end of March 1926, the construction of an Art Deco architectural market was complete, and began to be used a month after that. The market was originally known as Pasar Gedhe (Javanese: \\"[The] Large Market\\"), so called as it was the biggest in Yogyakarta at that time, as well as the only one on the main road area stretching from the Kraton to the Tugu (id).

The property is owned by Water NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  One of the first places in the Gundungurra traditional homelands that most appealed to the Anglo-Celt settlers were the river flats of the Burragorang Valley (now flooded under Warragamba Dam). Even before the valley was officially surveyed in 1827-8, many early settlers were already squatting on blocks that they planned to officially occupy following the issue of freehold title grants. From the Burragorang Valley and using Aboriginal pathways, other valleys to the west were occupied and developed by the settlers with construction of outstations and stock routes. These cattle entrepreneurs were then followed by cedar-wood extractors and miners. The Gundungurra traditional owners resisted the taking of their lands, and, relying on various laws of the colony at the time, continually applied for official ownership. Although their individual claims failed, in some kind of recognition of the significance of the designated tracts of land claimed, six Aboriginal reserves (under the control of the NSW Aborigines Protection Board) were formally declared in the Burragorang Valley. Even after these reserves were revoked, many of the traditional owners remained, quietly refusing to leave their traditional homelands. Finally pushed into the \\"Gully\\", a fringe development in West Katoomba from about 1894, the Gully community stayed together for more than 60 years until dispossessed of the Gully by the then Blue Mountains Shire Council so a group of local businessmen could develop a speedway that became known as the Catalina Race Track. The Gully people kept talking about areas of land they had walked in as children - the nearby Megalong and Kanimbla Valleys and the Burragorang Valley. They knew of the profound significance of these valleys for their parents and grandparents.Johnson, 2009, 4. =Warragamba Dam= Warragamba Dam was constructed from 1947-1960, along with adjacent Warragamba township, by the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board; with its own forces with various items being let on contract. Constructed of mass concrete in block sections, a total of of concrete was used to construct the straight gravity wall which featured a height of from foundation to crest. During the 1960s the public facilities and picnic areas were developed and finalised. Haviland Park was formed out of the original dam construction site and platforms on the eastern bank of the dam, with development, part of the beautification program, essentially undertaken in the early 1960s. Haviland Park was officially opened by the President of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, E.J.Walder, in December 1965. The name commemorates the role of President Haviland, Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Sydney who was consulted on the design of the parks at Warragamba. Part of these beautification works involved the removal of much of the Dam's construction and plant equipment and establishment of a planned landscape feature for use by the general public. In a design sense, Haviland Park is the most formal of the parks at Warragamba. Generally, landscaping as part of public facilities was provided at Cataract, Cordeaux and Avon, Nepean and Wornora dams and the Prospect Reservoir. They all contained similar features, e.g., the provision of picnic areas with hot water, barbeques and wood provided, seats and tables, lawns, shade trees, shelters, rubbish disposal points, and toilet facilities. The landscaping tended to mirror the construction phase of the Dam. Haviland Park for instance contains numerous archaeological, architectural and engineering remains, which show evidence of various construction phases. It is believed that several of the exotic species (Japonica, Weeping Wisteria, and Bauhinias) were transplanted from the maintenance area at the main weir because they were highly valued by the workers. The park area was once again used as a construction site, during the 1998-2004 construction of the auxiliary spillway to reduce the impacts of flooding, the required location and configuration of which has resulted in the reduction of the size of Haviland Park by about a third. The precinct has been closed since 1997 due to major construction works at the site - construction of the auxiliary spillway. The provision of picnic areas, hot water, barbecues, seats and tables, lawns, shade trees, rubbish disposal points and toilet facilities was similar to that provided by the Board at other dam sites in New South Wales. Some of picnic grounds were landscaped to include visitor facilities such as an oval, running tracks, tennis courts, picnic shelters, electric BBQs, boiling water outlets, group shelters and a kiosk. On completion the area, located to the south of the dam wall, consisted of a ridge between Lavender Creek and Folly Creek divided by a series of roadways and car parks which provided viewing access to the dam and a recreational park for visitors. The principle feature of the park was a double avenue of sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) trees along the access of the ridge punctuated by cross roads and featuring a weather shelter and a fountain design by Spooner. Around the perimeter of the park several buildings and facilities original to the dam construction were retained. In June 2016 the NSW Government announced that it would allocate $58m to raise the dam wall by to prevent flooding disaster to downstream towns.Nicholls, 17/6/16  Description  Wraragamba Dam is located in a narrow gorge within the Warragamba River, approximately south-west of Sydney and south of Penrith. The south-eastern corner of the site connects to the Warragamba township established as part of the Warragamba Supply Scheme. The northern side of the dam is adjacent to the Blue Mountains National Park. East if the dam is a large Entry Precinct and Picnic Grounds, and Haviland Park is between this Precinct and the dam itself and spillways. Haviland Park is to the dam's east and covers contains plantings and built features which are substantially intact from the time of establishment in the 1960s. There is remnant evidence of the construction apparatus, including rail tracks, building footings, concrete anchors, former aggregate conveyor tunnel, existing terraced road alignments, cableway and associated machinery. The existing timber and fibro systems office (former engineers office) and information centre (former staff mess) which constitute the only two remaining buildings from the original construction site. Haviland Park now comprises two open, relatively level grassed areas bounded by native and introduced trees and shrubs. The most prominent are two rows of sweet gums (Liquidambar styraciflua) planted during the 1960s. The areas are bounded by access roads with newly formed car parking areas and kerbs also provided. The precinct is the major open space recreation area of the dam but has been closed since 1997 due to construction works at the site.Sydney Catchment Authority, 2007, 1. Haviland Park covers an area of 10 acres contains plantings and built features which are substantially intact from the time of establishment. There is remnant evidence of the construction apparatus, including rail tracks, building footings, concrete anchors, former aggregate conveyor tunnel, existing terraced road alignments, 19 ton cableway and associated machinery. The tree lined avenue of exotic and indigenous plantings includes; coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sabiferum), brush box (Lophostemon confertus), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), paperbark (Melaleuca sp.), Jacaranda, camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), plus major species of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), Eucalypt, and she-oak (Casuarina sp.). The site is surrounded by a dry packed stone retaining wall. A landscaped exotic garden and steps adjacent to the existing picnic shelter to the north. This garden contains significant plantings, in this instance of Cacti, Agave, succulents, and Yuccas. Access is provided to the Folly Creek area. The facilities available for public use include, parking areas, viewing points, picnic areas with tables and seats, barbeque fireplaces, with wood provided, boiling water installations, children's playgrounds, shelter sheds, public toilets, and drinking fountains. The existing timber and fibro systems office (former engineers office) and information centre (former staff mess) which constitute the only two remaining buildings from the original construction site. = Modifications and dates = *1947-60: construction of Warragamba Dam and village, support & work facilities for dam workers. *1965: beautification works - Haviland Park was established, including avenue of trees, fountain and weather shelter. Haviland Park (4 ha) is a landscaped area located on the site of much of the dam's original construction plant and equipment.

The park was closed to the public during construction and has since undergone rehabilitation in accordance with the Master plan. This has involved re-alignment and replacement of many of the roads at the northern end. At the site of the proposed visitors centre only the landform survives, now with a sheer sandstone cutting overlooking the new spillway. A public platform and lookout was built on the eastern side of the gorge downstream of the dam with access from the Warragamba township. *2001: bushfires destroyed several buildings including the weather shelter in Haviland Park, the community relations office, the works depot area and sheds, suspension bridge, theatrette and vegetation throughout the site. *2002‚Äìpresent (2008): a Master Plan for Warragamba Dam's redevelopment was proposed and is being progressively implemented.

It represents the pinnacle of quality visitor facilities provided by the Board at Dam sites. It contains numerous archaeological, architectural and engineering remnants from the dam's construction. The Park displays a high degree of formality and planning and is rich in both exotic and native botanical species which contribute to the landscape significance of the park. It commemorates the role of Haviland, without whom the numerous landscaped parks and reserves of the Dams would not have been established, nor executed with such high regard for design and formalism. It is highly valued by the community of New South Wales as a place for passive recreation, leisure activities and sightseeing pursuits. Sydney Water continues the role of maintaining Haviland Park and providing visitor facilities.

It is one of the Rams group of card games characterised by allowing players to drop out of the current game if they think they will be unable to win any tricks or a minimum number of tricks.Card Games: Rams Group at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 16 October 2018  Background  Historically, Lampeln was banned in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1904 as a game of chance usually played for money; this ban was confirmed by the Austrian government in 1933.Regulation of Banned Games dated 2 January 1933 on the basis of Article III of the Act of 15 June 1920, the ST. G. Bl. No. 286. Today, Lampeln is still played in the Austrian states of Salzburg and Upper Austria as well as in Old Bavaria, Germany (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate). In 2017, volunteer firemen at the fire station in Sch√§flohe claimed to be the only ones in the province of Upper Palatinate who played Lampeln.Nur in Sch√§flohe wird gelampelt at www.onetz.de. Retrieved 18 October 2018 The name is derived from ' () which means lambing, because players who fail to take the minimum two tricks are called 'lambs'.  Aim  To take as many tricks as possible, but in any case a minimum of two to avoid a penalty.  Cards  The game is usually played with 32 cards from a 36-card William Tell pattern pack (in Austria) or Schafkopf pack (in Bavaria). The Seven of Bells is permanently the second highest trump and is nicknamed the Beankei (pronounced \\"beh ank-eye\\"), which means \\"a reward\\" or \\"rewarding\\" (from beanken, \\"to reward\\"), or the Belli.  Playing  = Austrian variant = The Austrian variant is more complicated that its Bavarian counterpart. Its distinguishing feature is 'hop and jump', whereby the role of dealer may switch to another player as a result of the cut and further contributions are paid to build up the pot more rapidly, which gives this variant more of a gambling flavour. In this respect it resembles Kratzen and Zwicken.  Dealing and cutting  The first dealer of a session is the youngest player. Thereafter the role of dealer rotates clockwise. The hand begins with the dealer paying 40 euro cents to the pot (Stock or Kassa) and shuffling the pack. Rearhand (on the dealer's right) cuts. He looks at the bottom card of the top packet without revealing it. Unless the card is a Sow, the 7 or 8, the dealer proceeds to deal the cards as described below. If, however, the bottom card is one of the aforementioned cards then a new deal is initiated as follows: * Sow - if it is a Sow, the bottom card of the bottom packet is exposed:  if it is not another Sow, the role of dealer passes to forehand (on the dealer's left) who pays 40 cents to the pot and shuffles the cards for a new hand.  if it is a second Sow, the whole pack is 'loaded' (geladen). Forehand and rearhand pay 40 cents to the pot and middlehand (opposite the dealer) takes over as dealer. * 8 - if it is the 8 (Katzengeist), then forehand becomes the new dealer (as in the case of a single Sow above) * 7 - if it is the 7 (Belli), everyone pays 40 cents to the pot and the same dealer reshuffles. The Sow, 7 and 8 must always be shown to the other players. The dealer now deals 8 cards, clockwise, to each player in packets of 3, 2 and 3. The dealer's fifth card is flipped to determine the trump suit. If it happens to be the 7, the dealer may choose any suit as trumps before looking at his hand. Beginning with forehand, the players announce, in clockwise order, whether they will 'play' (mitgehen) or 'stay at home' (daheimbleiben = 'pass') i.e. will drop out of the current deal. The dealer always has to play. If all three players 'stay at home', the dealer wins all 8 tricks automatically. If there is only 40 cents (or less) left in the pot at the beginning of a deal, it is an 'empty game' (leeres Spiel) and no-one is allowed to 'stay at home'.  Trick-taking  Forehand leads to the first trick. Thereafter the winner of the trick leads to the next. Players must follow suit, or trump if unable, and must win the trick if they can (i.e. Farbzwang, Trumpfzwang and Stechzwang apply). If a player cannot follow suit or trump, they may discard any card.  Scoring  Players win 1/8 of the pot for each trick taken. However, any player who takes fewer than two tricks is a 'lamb' (German: Lamm, Bavarian: lambbe) and has to pay penalty into the pot equivalent to the money remaining once the payments for tricks have been made. If there are two or three 'lambs', then each one has to pay the full amount. For example, supposing the players pay 20 cents each to the pot in each deal and the pot has built up to 160 cents. If one player wins five tricks and the rest win 1 trick each; the winner receives 50 cents and the others 10 cents each, leaving 80 cents in the pot. The three players who failed to take the minimum two tricks must each pay 80 cents into the pot (i.e. the equivalent of what was left in the pot after the payouts). = Bavarian variant = This is simpler than the Austrian variant, primarily because it omits the 'hop and jump' feature and makes it more suitable as a social, rather than a gambling, game.  Dealing  Dealer shuffles and rearhand cuts. The bottom card of the top stack is placed face up and determines the trump suit. Dealer now looks at the bottom 3 cards including the trump (which he would get anyway from the deal) and decides whether to play or not, depending on whether he has further trumps in addition to the single trump card. If not, the cards are thrown in and the next player deals, all the players paying e.g. 16c to the stock. If the dealer decides to 'play' then 2 √ó 4 cards are dealt in clockwise order beginning with forehand. Now the other players decide whether to play or pass, based on the number of trumps and Aces they hold. A game is viable if at least 2 players offer to 'play'.  Trick-taking  Players must follow suit, or trump if unable, and must win the trick if they can (i.e. Farbzwang, Trumpfzwang and Stechzwang apply). If a player cannot follow suit or trump, they may discard any card.  Scoring  To score, a player now has to win at least 2 tricks. The money in the stock, which must always be divisible by 8, is distributed among the trick winners. A player who wins no tricks or only one trick is 'sunk' (untergegangen) and has to pay a full stake into the stock. Once the stock is used up, a new game is started. Everyone pays the stake in again. This is called a Hudere. If one or more players 'sink', the stock gets replenished from the penalty payments.

He is associate professor of English Literature at Linnaeus University and Director of the Linnaeus University Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies. He received an MA from Brown University, Rhode Island in 1994, and a PhD from Uppsala University, Sweden, in 1997. He is best known for his work on the relationship between American gothic narratives and the long history of US imperialism, and on the Military First-Person Shooter. He has also written about Animal Horror Cinema, Nordic Gothic, British Invasion literature before WWI, and on the turn-of-the- century British author Richard Marsh. He has cooperated with Gothic scholar Justin D. Edwards and Indian writer and scholar Tabish Khair. He currently lives in Kalmar, Sweden.  The pre-WWI invasion narrative and Richard Marsh  H√∂glund's doctoral dissertation Mobilizing the Novel: The Literature of Imperialism and the First World War focuses on pre-WWI British military and gothic invasion narratives such as William Le Queux's The Invasion of 1910 (1906), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) and Richard Marsh's The Beetle. Since 2005, H√∂glund's work on British turn-of-the-century writing has mostly concerned the fiction of Richard Marsh and its discussion of race, innate criminality and eugenics.  Military Computer Games  H√∂glund has written about the connection between military digital games, US neo-colonialism and the Military industrial entertainment complex. H√∂glund has claimed that the Military First Person Shooter normalizes US military invasions of foreign, predominately Middle-Eastern nations.Electronic Empire: Orientalism Revisited in the Military Shooter‚Äù Game Studies. 8:1, 2008. (http://gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hoeglund) H√∂glund has also studied how the history of WWII and the ideology of Nazism is represented in the Call of Duty franchise.  American Empire  Building on Patrick's Brantlinger's observation in Rule of Darkness, British Literature and Imperialism, 1830-1914 that the late nineteenth century gothic novel was a vehicle of imperial sentiment, H√∂glund argues that American Gothic has been imperial since its inception in the late eighteenth century. In his book The American Imperial Gothic: Popular Culture, Empire Violence, H√∂glund traces this development from the publication of Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly in 1799, to the early years of the Barack Obama presidency. H√∂glund's research claims that Gothic and horror have played an important part during the expansion of the US Empire, especially during moments of imperial crisis.

It is also known as the Maid of Australia Inn, It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original Bird in Hand Inn was built opposite the current location in Bathurst Street in 1825. It was originally known as the Bird in the Hand, with Daniel Smallwood as the first licensee. George Buckridge took over the license soon after but following his death in 1843, the license went to Elizabeth. The 1827 and later 1841 detailed surveys of Pitt Town show the present site of the inn as vacant land, evidencing that the present building was constructed sometime after 1841 and likely in the late 1840s. Buckridge was succeeded by Richard Mawson in the 1850s. Mawson renamed the inn the Maid of Australia in the same era. It retained the Maid of Australia name until its closure in 1896 when it became a general store. It was restored in 1986 and by 1987, works were complete. It reopened as a hotel under its original name that same year. Most recently, a gaming room was added to the eastern end of the hotel in 2020. Description The Bird in Hand Inn is a very important Colonial Georgian inn prominently located in the centre of the village at Pitt Town. It is a two-storey four bay sandstock brick building with one angled corner wall, having a distinctive steeply pitched hipped iron roof. The walls of the inn are rendered and coursed in ashlar. The front wall of the inn has been extended in each direction as a single storey parapet. A seven bay skillion verandah runs the full length of the facade and along parapet side walls, timber posts rest on a flagstone floor. Replacement ground floor windows match the original upper storey windows. A two-storey wing, mimicking the scale and form of the original is located to the rear (northeast) of the original block and connected two it by a narrower two storey link. The building was restored throughout in the late 1980s, with obtrusive accretions removed and a large two-storey addition with beer garden and skillion verandah. The Pitt Town Village shopping complex is located adjacent: this is a Georgian-styled part single and part two-storey commercial development which is in keeping with the architectural language of the original inn. Significance The Bird in Hand Inn is of high historical significance as the earliest inn in Pitt Town. The inn is important for its association with Daniel Smallwood, a prominent pioneer of the town, who built the inn in 1825 and operated it until 1840. It is an important surviving example of a Georgian Colonial inn. While there are similar buildings surviving such as 265 George Street and the former Bell Inn, this style of building is becoming increasingly rare. The location of the Bird in Hand at the centre of the village of Pitt Town and on the prominent corner of Bathurst Street and Eldon Street makes it an important landmark in the village. Its steeply pitched roof makes it a landmark in the approach to the town. Its importance has been underlined by the construction of the commercial precinct of the village adjacent. The importance of the inn as a centre for social activity in the town has been continued in the recent years by its reuse as part of the commercial centre of the village. As the oldest inn in Pitt Town, the former Bird in Hand clearly has some archaeological potential.  Heritage listing  Bird In The Hand Inn was listed on the former Register of the National Estate on 14 May 1991 and on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was played on October 2, with Tampa Bay advancing to the American League Division Series to face the Houston Astros. The game was televised nationally by ESPN, and was sponsored by Hankook Tire for the second straight year. An alternate telecast, featuring Statcast analytics and sponsored by Amazon Web Services, aired on ESPN2. The game set the record for the highest attendance at a wild card game with an attendance of 54,005. For the third straight year, Major League Baseball sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series; as with the 2019 NL Wild Card Game, this wild-card game was again presented by sponsor Hankook Tire and officially known as the 2019 American League Wild Card Game presented by Hankook Tire. Background Oakland entered the game with a 97‚Äì65 record, while Tampa Bay was 96‚Äì66. They met seven times during the regular season, with Oakland winning the season series 4‚Äì3. The Oakland Athletics secured a berth in the Wild Card Game on September 27. The Athletics finished second in the American League West, behind the Houston Astros. Oakland secured home field advantage on September 28. This was Oakland's third postseason appearance as a wild card team. They previously appeared in the 2014 and 2018 Wild Card Games, losing both. The Tampa Bay Rays also secured a Wild Card berth on September 27. They finished second in the American League East, behind the New York Yankees. This was Tampa Bay's third postseason appearance as a wild card team. They previously appeared in one Wild Card Game, a win in 2013. Game results =Line score= Charlie Morton, with the 2018 Astros The Rays took an early lead in the first inning courtesy of a leadoff home run by Yandy D√≠az off Oakland starter Sean Manaea. Manaea gave up a single to Matt Duffy to begin the second inning, and Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a promptly homered to extend Tampa Bay's lead to 3‚Äì0. When Manaea gave up another home run to D√≠az in the third inning, he was lifted in favor of Yusmeiro Petit. The Athletics scored their lone run of the game in the bottom of the third, when a throwing error by Mike Brosseau allowed Marcus Semien to reach third base and Ram√≥n Laureano drove him in with a sacrifice fly. However, Tommy Pham's fifth inning home run off Petit again gave the Rays a four-run lead. Charlie Morton was relieved after the bottom of the fifth by Diego Castillo, Nick Anderson, and Emilio Pag√°n, who combined for four scoreless innings to seal the victory for Tampa Bay.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The Norman church had a west tower added in 1636, replacing a previous wooden tower. Part of the nave was added by John Soane in 1802. The parish is part of the benefice of Sherfield on Loddon, Stratfield Saye and Hartley Wespall with Stratfield Turgis, Bramley and Little London within the Diocese of Winchester. Architecture The flint building has stone dressings and a tiled roof. The walls are supported by buttresses. The south porch and three-stage tower are of red brickwork. Some of the windows in the north wall remain from the original Norman structure. The interior includes a 13th century piscina while the screen, benches, pulpit and communion rail are from the 16th to 18th centuries. Wall paintings Wall painting on the south wall depicting the martyrdom of Thomas Becket In the 1870s, Charles Eddy, vicar of the church, uncovered a large number of wall paintings and painted scriptural texts dating to the 13th through 16th centuries which had been whitewashed over in 1550‚Äì1551 during the Reformation. The earliest paintings are on the south wall, and depict a series of martyrdoms, the best preserved being a depiction of the murder of Thomas Becket by four knights in 1170. On the north wall is 16th-century depiction of St Christopher which bears a remarkable likeness to contemporary portraits of King Henry VIII. The north wall also has paintings of scriptural texts (John 3:5, Psalm 26 verse 6, and Psalm 95), as well as two consecration crosses. There are also elaborate decorative painted designs in the chancel, around the north and south windows, and on the east wall, with paintings of saints on either side of the east window.

Model I The car, also known as the Type I, was a total redesign and given the new 12-4 name. It featured a longer six-light body based on the Vauxhall 10 but with a monocoque hull with independent torsion-bar front suspension and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Lockheed hydraulic drum brakes were fitted all round to the same design as the 10-4 and featured a split circuit to prevent complete loss of braking in the event of a fluid leak. The engine was a 4-cylinder 1.4-litre (1442 cc) with overhead valves enlarged from the 10-4 by increasing the bore from 63.5mm to 69.5mm and keeping the same 95mm stroke. A Zenith carburettor was fitted. For UK taxation purposes it was rated at 11.98hp. The actual output was at 3800 r.p.m. The gearbox was the 3-speed, with synchromesh on second and top, that was used in the 10-4. Two versions of the saloon body were available, a Standard and a De-luxe, the latter featuring a sliding sunroof. The Standard version was dropped for the 1940 year. The Autocar magazine tested a de-luxe saloon in 1938 and found it would reach and accelerate from 0-50 mph (80 km/h) in 22 seconds.

According to the Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory he was \\"one of the most prominent figures in the South Yorkshire coal mining industry\\". He held significant posts in the mining, gas and coke industries both in South Yorkshire and nationally. Between 1934 and 1937 he was one of the assessors in the Gresford disaster inquiry and, along with the other assessor, published dissenting reports to the main inquiry.  Background  Brass' father Thomas Francis Brass OBE, JP, MA(Durham) was born in 1858, the son of a blacksmith in Sherburn Hill, County Durham. TF Brass rose from colliery clerk through colliery cashier, to become a Surface Manager and eventually the Under Manager for Kimblesworth Colliery. By 1921 he was the agent (responsible for the general laying out and supervision of the workings) for Charlaw & Sacriston Collieries Co Ltd. In 1903 he was one of the team of rescuers who entered the flooded Sacriston pit. For this he was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society. TF Brass retired in 1934 and died in 1937.  Early life  Brass was born 1879 in Wingate, County Durham. He was the eldest son of Thomas Francis Brass, the agent for Charlaw & Sacriston Collieries Co Ltd. Brass attended the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1894 he started work at Charlaw & Sacriston Collieries in County Durham. In 1902 he gained his Manager's certificate (number 2,098) and in 1903 became the manager or Primrose Colliery. In that year he was one of the rescuers who entered Sacriston Colliery along with his father, but unlike his father he was not awarded a RHS medal. By 1909 he was a member of the Institute of Mining Engineers. First World War During the First World War he was Acting Major, 13th York and Lancaster Service Battalion. Later in the war Brass was appointed Divisional Commander of Special Police for the Staincross Division of Yorkshire and became a Military Representative on Tribunals. Colliery Manager In 1923 Brass was Director and General Manager of Houghton Main Colliery Co Ltd. Between 1923 and 1925 he was the President of the Midland Institute of Mining Engineers during which time he also became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1929 Brass was a member of the committee which examined the issues surrounding the replacement of rail mounted tubs with conveyor belts. In 1935 he was awarded the Medal of the Institution of Mining Engineers \\"in recognition of distinguished services to the mining profession and industry over a period of many years\\". He was also awarded the Peake Gold Medal by the Midland Institute of Mining Engineers.  Gresford inquiry  On Saturday 22 September 1934 at 2:08 a.m. a violent explosion ripped through the Dennis section of Gresford Colliery. An inquiry into the Gresford disaster was ordered on 11 October 1934 and sat intermittently from 25 October 1934 to 13 December 1936. The report was laid before Parliament and debated on 23 February 1937. The inquiry sat with a commissioner and two assessors, one of whom was Brass. The outcome was unusual for all three men arrived at different conclusions with the assessors' reports being presented as appendices to the main report. The official finding, as presented by the commissioner Sir Henry Walker, viewed with suspicion shot firing activities. The other assessor, Mr Joseph Jones, was concerned about a possible firedamp build up on one of the faces which was ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or from a spark from a mechanised coalcutter. Brass however was concerned about the telephones which were not of an approved type. He surmised that the explosion could have been caused by a gas build on one of the main access tunnels which was ignited by the telephone being called.

Portrayed by Lorenzo James Henrie, he is the teenage son of Travis Manawa and Liza Ortiz. Christopher was shown to be a normal teenager before the apocalypse occurred, though he did appear to be extremely angered at his father for leaving and seemed to hold this against him for the rest of his life. Chris slowly adapted to the apocalypse in the beginning and retained his kind side, though after the death of his mother, he is shown to be even more angered and traumatized. Character biography At first, Chris seems to get along well with the Clarks, however, as the zombie apocalypse goes on, Chris's relationship with them worsens. =Season 1= Nick Clark, Madison Clark, and Travis Manawa choose to flee to the desert, and they want Alicia Clark, Liza Ortiz, and Chris to follow. The group returns to Madison's home to gather supplies. Chris‚Äô bus is trapped in a traffic jam caused by a zombie shooting by the police. He films the event and joins in a protest against that and other recent fatal police shootings, when Travis and Liza meet up with him. A riot erupts after police shoot down another zombie, but the three Manawas find refuge with the Salazars in their gated barbershop-home. Travis tells Madison to take the kids to the desert without him; he will catch up. The group inside the barbershop remains trapped, while the riot outside intensifies. While a riot rages outside, a mob sets fire to the store adjoining the barbershop, forcing the Salazars and Manawas to flee. The group reaches Travis' truck and escapes, but not before Griselda is injured by a collapsing scaffold. Unable to reach a hospital, the group drives to Madison's house, where Nick, Madison, and Alicia temporarily flee. Nick leads Madison and Alicia to the Trans' house next door, where they take a shotgun. Travis arrives and is attacked by Mr. Dawson, who is shot and killed by Daniel Salazar. All three families decide to stay the night and evacuate in the morning. The next morning, as the Clarks and Manawas start driving away, the National Guard arrives and quarantines the block. While Travis says, \\"It's going to get better,\\" Daniel laments that it's, \\"too late,\\" as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house. Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to live normally. Tensions build under the military rule. Chris shows a video to Travis and Madison of a light signaling from the Dead Zone. Soldiers take Griselda and Nick to a hospital, but Nick's family protests his departure. Liza agrees to go to assist the medical team, despite not wanting to leave her son. Travis retreats to the roof and sees the signal from the Dead Zone. Seconds later, he sees and hears gunfire, followed by darkness. Chris is devastated that Liza left voluntarily to help at the hospital, but Travis promises to bring her back. Alicia and Chris get drunk in and vandalize the abandoned home of a wealthy family. After Nick and Strand was recused from the base, Strand brings the group to his house. Liza reveals to Madison that she had been bitten during the escape. Liza pleads with Madison and Travis to euthanize her before she turns. Travis promises to protect Chris before shooting Liza out of mercy. =Season 2= Shortly after the death of his mother that night, Chris along with his father, and Madison are on the beach due to the infected coming in while explosions are heard with the sky in orange. Chris kneels next Liza's corpse mourning her. Travis yells at Chris to go towards the water, but Chris says he's not leaving her, but as the infected starts coming towards them they go to the zodiac where Nick's at, Travis picks up Liza's corpse and Chris gets on the zodiac with the group and head towards Strand's yacht The Abigail reuniting with the rest of the group. Chris along with the group freeze in silence as they see from afar the military bombing Los Angeles, engulfing the city in flames. The next morning, Chris is seen looking at his dead mother's corpse. He kisses her on the forehead and covers up the rest of her body. Chris goes fishing with Daniel, they empathize due to their loss. At Liza's funeral after Travis' speech on Chris being the best thing he and Liza did, Chris slowly walks over and angrily throws Liza overboard. Development and reception Chris Manawa is portrayed by Lorenzo James Henrie (pictured) The second-season episode \\"Wrath\\" features the death of Chris Manawa. In a joint-episode review along with the second-season finale, Matt Fowler of IGN gave \\"Wrath\\" and \\"North\\" an 8.5/10.0 rating together, the highest rating of the season, stating; \\"Fear the Walking Dead finishes its shaky second season on a satisfying note with some nice, sinister surprises and big, brutal moments. Travis' extended beatdown and murder of Derek and Brandon was excellently done, as were the consequences of those actions (which accidentally took an innocent life). Over on Nick's side of the story, we all knew Alejandro would be exposed as a fraud at some point, but everything was handled well and Nick got to save the day (well... until the very end) without having to rush in and physically protect people like an action hero.\\" References Category:Characters created by Robert Kirkman Category:Fear the Walking Dead Category:Fictional characters from California Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Fictional MƒÅori people Category:Fictional Hispanic and Latino American people ","title":"Chris Manawa"},{"id":"58662353","text":"Claremont Cottage is a heritage-listed residence at Claremont Crescent, Windsor, City of Hawkesbury, New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1807 to 1822. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1796, John Pugh and Charles Thomas were granted adjoining farms, though the official deed was not issued until 1802, and commenced to clear their land. Pugh's grant of 25 acres became known as \\"Pugh's Farm\\", while Thomas' grant of 20 acres became \\"Thomas Farm\\". In 1804, Pugh received a grant of 190 acres at what was known as \\"Mulgrave Farm\\". By 1806, Pugh was a substantial landholder, with 22 acres in grain, 193 acres of pasture and for horses and 11 pigs. However, in 1811, he sold his farm to John Jones and went to live in Windsor, selling a remaining landholding to Henry Kable in 1812. In 1822, John Jones conveyed a significant landholding to William Cox, including Pugh's Farm, 10 acres of Thomas' Farm, and 24.5 acres of other land. Cox was succeeded as owner Alfred Cox. Though William Cox is listed as an owner of Claremont Cottage, he had actually settled at Clarendon - a few miles west of Windsor - and is not believed to have lived at Claremont. The nucleus of the present Claremont Cottage stood on the land by the time William Cox became owner in 1822. The main body of the brick cottage was completed at the same time as the nearby St Matthew's Anglican Church (1820), but the kitchen has been ascribed to the first owner of the property, John Pugh. It is doubtful that the outbuildings which form part of the rear of Claremont were built by Pugh in 1796. However it seems that they were extant by 1822. It also appears from various evidence that a building occupied by Pugh stood on that site in 1807. It is possible that the building he occupied in 1807 was a brick cottage that now forms part of the rear section of Claremont.Kass, 1996, 12 From 1828 the cottage was occupied by Francis Beddeck, solicitor, who was married to Elizabeth Blachford, sister to Mrs William Cox.Kass, 1996,4 Upon Blachford's marriage to Beddeck, Governor Darling gave her two square miles of land as a marriage portion.Baker, 1967; Kingston, 1990 It was later owned by James Chaseling from 1870 to 1906 and prominent dairy farming figure Sir Philip Belmont Charley from 1936 to 1976.  Description  The original Claremont Cottage was a Colonial Georgian cottage built of stuccoed brick with wide verandahs all contained under a low pitched hipped roof. It had double French doors opening onto the verandah, other windows being twelve pane type with louvered shutters and flat stone lintels. It retained some original joinery. The front rooms were connected to the older rear kitchen section by a covered breezeway, typical of an early homestead.Baker, 1967 It was substantially destroyed by fire 1970s-80s, resulting in the property becoming temporarily abandoned. The oldest building remains and some small remnant parts of the 1820s section, together with other old sections (not dated). The major part of 1820s section had to be rebuilt. A mature Moreton Bay fig tree (Ficus macrophylla) was removed in 2010. The garden is much changed. There is a good view west from the house across a dam to adjoining ploughed paddocks. Behind the oldest building is a circular garden bed which contains a large grave headstone (loose). There is a driveway lined with Nile lilies (Agapanthus orientalis) from the gates down to the back of the building complex. An earlier drive came through on an upper level on the eastern side of the buildings ending in a carriage building (no longer existing). In the early 2000s the property was sold and the current owners have rebuilt.  Heritage listing  One of the oldest remaining houses in the Windsor district having associations with many distinguished Hawkesbury families dating back to 1796 including William Cox from 1822 to 1849; Francis Beddeck, the lawyer, from 1850 to 1853; James Chaseling from 1870 to 1906; and Philip Charley form 1936 to 1976. Claremont Cottage has kept its colonial atmosphere, thanks to sympathetic additions and alterations over time, and is a good example from the early Colonial period.Sheedy 1976 Claremont Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Claremont Cottage is one of the oldest buildings in the Hawkesbury region, dating back to 1796 as indicated by a plaque on its wall listing all of its previous owners. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The ownership of Claremont Cottage is a long list of distinguished Hawkesbury families dating back to 1796. In particular, William Cox from 1822 to 1849, and Francis Beddeck from 1850 to 1853. Though William Cox is listed as an owner, it is doubtful that he ever lived in this house. Cox had originally arrived in Australia in 1800 as paymaster in the NSW Corps, and returned to Australia once more after a trip to England in 1807, when he is known to have settled at Clarendon, west of Windsor, where he ran a large and efficient estate. Cox is best remembered for the 101 miles of road that he built across the Blue Mountains with the aid of twenty convicts and eight soldiers between July 1814 and January 1815. He also built houses and public buildings, conducted minor explorations and was appointed Magistrate by Governor Macquarie. William Cox is also known for his humanitarianism with regard to his treatment of convict servants. Beddeck arrived in the colony in 1827 and took up residence in Claremont Cottage in 1828. Along with William Cox Jr., he was among those nominated by Governor George Gipps to form the first Windsor District Council.Baker, 1967; Barkley & Nichols, 1994 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Claremont Cottage, with its low eaves and wide verandahs opening out onto gently sloping green lawns, with its cellars and its rambling interior, the front rooms connected to the older rear kitchen section by a covered breezeway, is still a typical early homestead. All additions over time have been made in a logical and sympathetic way, allowing the house to keep its colonial atmosphere which dates back to 1796.Barker, 1967 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Claremont Cottage was owned and occupied since 1796 by a long list of distinguished Hawkesbury identities including William Cox and Francis Beddeck. These identities are an integral part of the growth and development of both Windsor and the Hawkesbury district including its first proclaimed local council in 1824. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Dating back to 1796, Claremont Cottage is representative of the typical Colonial building and construction style. The architectural style of the house together the visible changes that have been made to its original structure over time, also reflects the evolution of society and culture from Colonial times to the present.

Biography  Margit Rupp was born in Budapest. She studied at the Fodor Conservatorium and at the Budapest Music Academy where she was taught by Arturo de Sanctis. She made her debut in Budapest. After her marriage to logistics entrepreneur Gottfried Schenker-Angerer in 1919 she joined her husband in Vienna, where their daughter Maria was born in 1922.Marcel Prawy, The Vienna Opera (New York 1970), Angerer quickly made herself a reputation in the Lieder genre through performances in Vienna. In 1928 she gave the world premier of \\"Three sings for singer and piano Opus 22\\" by Korngold, accompanied by the composer himself as pianist. She made her Vienna opera debut in 1926 as Leonora in Verdi's La forza del destino. Chronik der Wiener Staatsoper 1869 bis 2009, hg. von Wiener Staatsoper, zusammengestellt von Andreas L√°ng und Oliver L√°ng (Wien 2009) . Part 2: K√ºnstlerverzeichnis. Marcel Prawy wrote of her debut: ::Margit Schenker- Angerer, a prominent figure of Viennese society, was also extremely good- looking, with the smile and the figure of a Botticelli nymph...Her friends and acquaintances were just waiting for the merchant's wife to come a cropper and disgrace the entire opera as well as herself. Was it not a clear case of a stage-struck amateur aspiring to make a career as a singer with her husband's money and position behind her? But as the premiere took its course it became increasingly obvious that 'Manzi' was a professional to her finger-tips, and as Leonora she went from strength to strength, while the face of the friends and acquaintances grew redder and redder\\"Marcel Prawy, The Vienna Opera (New York 1970), In 1927 she signed a contract with the Vienna State Opera, where she appeared more than 160 times in solo roles until 1935. Abroad, she used the stage names Margit von Rupp and Margit Schenker-Angerer. Angerer also worked outside of Vienna, notably at the Salzburg Festival where she appeared in 1930, 1933 and 1935 as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier. She regularly played Octavian in Vienna, too: it appears to have been the role for which she was best known. In May 1929 Hugo von Hofmannsthal wrote to Richard Strauss: \\"Angerer's Octavian is charming and ever better; absolutely the best in the history of the opera\\".Hugo von Hofmannsthal, \\"Brief-Chronik\\", edited Hauser, Perrig, Bornand, Schmid et al, (Universit√§tsverlag Winter GmbH Heidelberg, 2003), letter dated 7 May 1929, column 2855 Other frequent stage portrayals included Elsa in Lohengrin and Dorota in Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper. In Salzburg, she made her first appearance during the 1930 Festspiele in the title role in Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Aulide. Three years later, she appeared there as Aithra in Die √§gyptische Helena, a less well known product of the long professional partnership between Richard Strauss and his librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Her role as \\"the concert singer\\" in Gustav Fr√∂hlich's Rakoczy-Marsch (1933) is her only known appearance in film. Angerer stopped working at the Vienna State Opera in 1935, although sources indicate that she continued to appear as a Lieder singer. There are indications that her retirement from the opera house may have resulted from her having been identified as a political dissident, critical of the authoritarian regime that had come to power in 1934. In November 1946, she applied for and was given membership in the Association of Political Prisoners. In her application she stated that in October 1944, while still living in Vienna, she and her daughter had been imprisoned by the Gestapo. It does in any case appear that by 1946 she was in London. In 1949 she married Stephan Karpeles-Schenker at Westminster in England. Her various recordings were issued as individual 78rpm discs (one aria/duet per each of the two sides, as was standard practice at the time) and later collected on (first) a 33rpm black disc album and (later) as a CD. She made recordings with Alfred Piccaver between 1928 and 1930.

It was possibly designed by Albert Bond and built in 1892. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The stables group was built about 1892 for Samuel Hordern, grandson of the founder of the firm and the builder of the Palace Emporium, Brickfield Hill, Sydney. Although there is no definite evidence on hand, the architect for the stables group could have been Albert Bond, the Hordern family architect during the period 1876-1910. Wilton Park became one of the leading horse breeding studs in Australia, contributing significantly to the quality of horses in the colony and producing many winners. After Samuel Horden's death in 1909, Wilton Park remained in the Hordern family, until sold in 1927.LEP, 1991.  Description  Sited on gently sloping ground in a formal composition around a central quadrangle. Central to the group is a grassed quadrangle, originally raked gravel. The buildings facing onto the quadrangle are fine examples of rural architecture from a time when stock breeding was an important and developing industry.RNE, 1980. The stables group consists of stables, a building containing a coach- house and harness room, underground water tanks, stallion boxes, a covered yard and a quadrangle. The present house built in 1955 is not included in the heritage-listed estate. Three buildings of the group enclose a quadrangle which was originally of raked gravel (now grass). The stables building, which faces north and which contains twelve loose boxes, is long and narrow in plan, built of sandstock brick, with a gable roof finished with iron ventilators and decorative fretwork barge boards. Floors vary from perforated plank floors over brick urine drains, to brick paving. In the centre, a gabled opening gives access to paddocks and rolling hills beyond. Another similar building, facing east, contains the coach house and harness room with a fine original harness cupboard as well as the grooms' room and feed room. The north side of the quadrangle is formed by two underground water tanks roofed with low hipped roofs and capped with iron ventilators. The original water tank and windmill have been removed. Two detached stallion boxes, with details similar to the stables face away from the quadrangle. The covered round year is constructed of posts set in the earth to form a ring about in diameter, lined internally with two layers of boarding. Encircling the post tops is a continuous, circular laminated wall plate to form a \\"parasol\\", perforated at its apex by an iron ventilator. The collar ties radiate like spokes of a wheel from a central hub and four suspension rods link the hub and the apex. The roof of mitred corrugated iron is fixed to concentric rings of roof battens. room The buildings are in good condition and were restored in sympathy with the original design in the late 1970s.  Heritage listing  As at 27 March 2012, the Wilton Park stables group which remains much as it was when retailer Samuel Hordern established his thoroughbred horse stud there, has historic significance because it forms a record of a significant part of the activities of a man who was a successful leader in Australian stud stockbreeding as well as a wealthy and successful businessman. The stables were built at a time when the horse was at its peak in Australian agriculture and stockbreeding was a developing skill and these buildings are fine examples of the rural architecture which developed in response to the needs of the bloodstock industry. The stables group also has aesthetic significance derived from the fact that the individual buildings relate well to each other and to their environment. Their siting on gently rising ground in a formal composition around a central quadrangle creates an impressive vista when seen from the original main eastern approach and from the Wilton Road. Individual buildings are themselves fine examples of rural architecture. In particular, the covered round yard is of rare architectural quality and an excellent example of highly skilled timber craftsmanship. It may have been the model for the brick round yard at Retford Park, Bowral, another former Hordern family property. It also forms an interesting contrast, both visually and in form and materials, with the brick buildings of the group. Of historic, architectural and aesthetic value. Sited on gently sloping ground in a formal composition around a central quadrangle, the buildings are fine examples of rural architecture from a time when stock breeding was an important and developing Industry.

Name  The party's name is taken from an Armenian heroic epic poem Daredevils of Sassoun (Sasna Tsrer in Armenian). Organization The party is led by a seven member secretariat: Garegin Chugaszyan, Alexander Yenikomshian, Gevorg Safaryan, Vahagn Avagyan, Arek Kyureghyan, Ruzan Yeghnukyan and Varuzhan Avetisyan. History Sasna Tsrer was previously a radical opposition to the pro-Russian rule of Serzh Sargsyan and his Republican Party of Armenia, whose activities culminated in the 2016 Yerevan hostage crisis. The party later renounced violence. Jirair Sefilian, a veteran of the Nagorno-Karabakh war, is one of the party's key figures. Sasna Tsrer participated in the 2018 parliamentary elections, but received only 1.82% of the votes. As this was lower than the 5% minimum threshold required, the party failed to gain any representation in the National Assembly. Despite not gaining any seats, the party has remained active in Armenian politics and currently acts as an extra-parliamentary force. Following the 2018 elections, the party initially supported newly elected Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and endorsed Pashinyan's new government; Sefilian had stated that he had a constructive relationship with Pashinyan. However, the party eventually became dissatisfied with Pashinyan and his performance. Sasna Tsrer voiced support for the creation of an alliance of Pro-Western political forces, namely with the European Party of Armenia. Tigran Khzmalyan, leader of the European Party of Armenia also headed the call by stating, \\"We are in a situation where radical opposition and democratic forces must unite and demand a strategy of joining Armenia with Western powers.\\" In May 2020, Jirair Sefilian signed a declaration along with two-dozen other political figures calling on the Pashinyan government to hold snap parliamentary elections. The party has also announced its intentions to set up a sister party in the Republic of Artsakh. Ideology At times, Sasna Tser has been portrayed as extreme nationalists. De-facto party leader Jirair Sefilyan supports the creation of a United Armenia. They explicitly call for unification of the Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) with Armenia. Sasna Tser staunchly opposed Armenia's former ruling party, the Republican Party. The strategic goal of the party is to unite Armenians in Armenia and abroad, ensure the sustainability of the Armenian nation and it's global influence. The parties foreign policy is strongly anti-Russian, with its manifesto calling for the ‚Äúliberation of Armenia from Russian colonial rule‚Äù and the withdrawal from Russian-led organizations including the Eurasian Economic Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the CIS. The party calls for the immediate withdrawal of Russian soldiers from Armenia and the closure of the Russian 102nd Military Base in Gyumri. Despite the party's anti-Russian views, the party is also opposed of Armenia joining NATO. The party advocates for establishing strategic alliances with the United States and Iran and building closer cooperation with the European Union, Ukraine, Georgia, China and India.

The main and auxiliary buildings are part of the historical building ensemble of the old town.  Stollbergstra√üe  Stollbergstra√üe is a street named in 1968 after Georg Stollberg (1853-1926), director of the Schauspielhaus on Maximilianstra√üe (today's M√ºnchner Kammerspiele) and long-time director of the Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz. The road leads from Herrnstra√üe to Maximilianstra√üe. It was formerly the northwestern section of the Kanalstra√üe, which was separated by the Altstadtring (section Thomas-Wimmer-Ring) from the still old name bearing eastern part and was disconnected at the southern end to Herrnstra√üe. Like its northern continuation beyond the Maximilianstra√üe, the Herzog-Rudolph-Stra√üe, its course corresponds to the moat on the outside of the former wall fortification from the first half of the 17th century.  History  The original three-storey residential building on a square floor plan was built in 1856 on behalf of Julius Grubert, Managing Director of Palmsche Hofbuchhandlung, it was designed by Matthias Berger and supervised by Friedrich B√ºrklein. The original fa√ßade tiling, signed by Berger and B√ºrklein, shows a sparing division in the Maximilian style, with Gothic elements on the flat center-piece crowned with a pointed helmet. On the courtyard side, the construction was higher due to an additional lower level. The foundation of the building was partly built on the remains of the former wall fortification of the city center. In 1890, architect Emil Ludwig led an expansion of the lower levels on the courtyard side. On the street side, the house was increased by three rooms. The Neo-Renaissance layout of the fa√ßade likely dates to the same period, but it was later simplified. In the middle of the back of the house, a floor expansion was added (kitchen extension) in 1900, south of which in 1905 an altane was added by Heilmann and Littmann. In the historic garden is a small teahouse from the 19th century. The original ceiling painting depicts flying birds and leaves.  Renovation and today's use  In 2013, the building was acquired by a private investment company owned by Peter L√∂w and re-developed according to the specifications of the historical building protection regulations. Historic features were preserved, including original door frames and windows, as well as stucco and wooden floors from the late 18th century. Due to the redevelopment, it was removed from the historical building list on 22 December 2014.

Significantly the building was constructed for the ANZACs of World War I nearly 20 years after the end of the war. The clinic subsequently supported the wellbeing of veterans of World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War. The Australian veteran community consider it a sacred place due to the connection to the suffering of veterans returned from those wars. Post-World War I In 1936 the Repatriation Commission took control of a parcel of land on the corner of St Kilda Rd and Coventry St from the Department of Defence to construct a facility to address the needs of the large population of World War I veterans. 'The out-patient clinic, which is at present within the Branch Office on St. Kilda-road, Melbourne, is so congested that no longer can the conditions be allowed to remain, and plans have been prepared for the erection of an out-patient clinic on a site made available by the Defence Department.

'With increasing numbers requiring out-patient treatment, the accommodation at the Branch Office in St. Kilda-road was inadequate. Men suffering from all types of disabilities, many of them accompanied by their wives and children, had to sit in a basement waiting room. Another inconvenience through lack of space was the necessity for accommodating two medical examiners in each of the small cubicles built as examination rooms. These disabilities, together with other factors, made it imperative that better conditions should be provided. It was decided to erect a new out-patient clinic, the building embodying the latest facilities, including air conditioning, single rooms for medical examining officers, and a large general waiting room.', It was decided to erect a new out-patient clinic, the building embodying the latest facilities, including air conditioning, single rooms for medical examining officers, and a large general waiting room. On this site the Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic was built adjacent to Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, it was opened on 15 November 1937,, THE new building will re-place the present obsolete clinic in the basement of the Department's central ad-ministrative building.

Post-World War II Up to 250 veterans visited the clinic each day with as many as 200 at a time waiting to see one of the six doctors available. As early as 1946 complaints emerged that the clinic was too small and understaffed for the large number of veterans attending each day. The delays and inability to see a doctor after hours caused veterans to loose earnings leading to increased calls to see their own doctors in the suburban consulting rooms. These calls where rejected., For months the organisations have complained that the Repatriation Department's Clinic in St. Kilda Road Is small and under staffed., Every week hundreds who served in World Wars One and Two are coming away from the Out-Patients' Clinic in St. Kilda Road, feeling that they have been thrown a bone from a charity institution. An extension was added to the building in 1950 for a war neurosis clinic, designed by D. B. Windebank. Based on the success of the addition of the neurosis clinic the Minister for Repatriation, Senator Sir Walter Cooper (Queensland politician) M.B.E. (Mil), and the Repatriation Department, planned to establish outpatient clinics for psychiatric treatment in all capital cities. Since the clinic was opened the Australian Red Cross maintained a canteen where tea, coffee and biscuits were provided. As many as 25 volunteers ran the canteen on a non-profit basis to support and comfort the veterans waiting for their appointments. Between 200 and 250 where served by the Red Cross on a daily basis between 10am and 4pm. One veteran reported to have served in the Sudan War was affectionately called 'Keep Smiling' for his happy disposition. The Repatriation Clinic ceased operations in 1980 and was handed back to the Department of Defence. From this point it was used as the Maintenance Engineering Agency (MEA), now the Land Engineering Agency (LEA), until December 1995. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works considered a proposal in 1993 to repurpose the building into its original purpose as the Defence Health Care Centre (DHCC) at a cost of $1.3million, which was not approved., 310 St Kilda Road now resembles a 'rabbit warren' which could be converted to its original function. The former Repatriation Clinic has been reportedly vacant since 1999 while the MEA newsletter (Maintenance News) No's. 66 (Sep 1995) and 67 (Dec 1995) indicates the last organisation to occupy the Repatriation Clinic moved out in 1995. On 15 November 2017, the 80th anniversary of the opening of the Repatriation Clinic, Senator Derryn Hinch moved motion no.563 in the Senate to acknowledge the event and the significance of the clinic to the wellbeing of the veteran community while Victorian Member of Parliament, Tim McCurdy, acknowledged the milestone in the Parliament of Victoria., Today is the 80th anniversary of the opening of the former Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic at St Kilda Road. The clinic's future After the clinic had been sitting vacant for nearly two decades, the Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, David Feeney, delivered an adjournment speech, A proposal ... which I find myself passionate about, is to turn this unused building back to its original glory and once again help aid in repatriating our returned soldiers back into the community through the use of art rehabilitation developed by the ANVAM initiative, a national tribute to military veterans and families. to the Australian House of Representatives on 26 March 2015 expressing his support for the proposal raised by the ex-service organisation and veterans charity, the Australian National Veterans Arts Museum (ANVAM) to turn the \\"unused building back to its original glory and once again help aid in repatriating our returned soldiers back into the community through the use of art rehabilitation\\". Within two months, on 6 May 2015, the Department of Defence added the Repatriation Clinic to its Disposal Program. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) released a policy, The building will be remediated and restored by the Department of Defence, before being returned to its original purpose as a centre caring for veterans. on 17 June 2016 to turn the clinic into an Australian National Veterans Arts Centre (ANVAC) following lobbying by ANVAM. In the same year the Department of Defence indicated the former Repatriation Clinic would be sold that attracted some political, An opportunity has gone missing for the Turnbull Government to help veterans as Defence confirm the sale of 310 St. Kilda road at Victoria Barracks. and media attention., ...its proposed sale has been greeted with fury by a small band of veterans who, for three years, have quietly lobbied the department to turn it into an art gallery for returned service men and women. Later the Department of Defence indicated negotiations were underway to transfer the property to the State Government of Victoria. A nomination, The Former Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic also reflects the social impacts of war and the notable requirement for a wide range of services to support injured soldiers with recovery and reintegration into civilian life. was submitted to Heritage Victoria for the listing of the Repatriation Clinic on the Victorian Heritage Register. A report (Ref: 200349) was prepared for the Victorian Heritage Council in May 2017 noting that \\"The Former Repatriation Outpatients Clinic has a special association with returned service personnel from conflicts since World War I. For present day returned personnel, the place provides a strong emotional connection to past veterans and their experiences of war trauma and disability\\". The report was not considered by the Council pending the outcome of the sale process. A Change.org petition undertaken by ANVAM during 2017 to \\"Save the WW1 Heritage Building at 310 St Kilda Rd to Help Veterans\\" attracted over 13,600 signatures supporting ANVAM's proposal to return it to the veteran community as a cultural centre for veterans wellbeing. Amanda Rishworth, Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, restated the Australian Labor Party's commitment to dedicating the property for veterans arts in April 2017., Labor has long advocated for this project. As part of its community engagement program, ANVAM worked with RMIT interior design students in 2017 to envision potential designs for the clinic as a cultural institution with some projects presented online., The first phase of this project involved analyzing and learning about museum spaces in relation to preservation, restoration, and reuse. The future of the property was first raised in Senate Estimates by Senator Derryn Hinch on 1 March 2017, I am aware of ANVAMs interest and engagement, yes. and further discussed or raised through questions on notice (QoN) on the following dates: *29 May 2017 Senator Alex Gallacher, So 310 St Kilda Road has not been used by the Department of Defence for some considerable time. *25 Nov 2017 Senator Alex Gallacher, The ball is very much in the court of the Victorian government. We have been working with them for some months now. *28 Feb 2018 Senator Kimberley Kitching, We are awaiting a response from the Victorian government in relation to their position. *30 May 2018 Senator Alex Gallacher and Senator Kimberley Kitching, The situation at 310 St Kilda Road is unchanged since we last met. The situation is that the Victorian government in February last year expressed renewed interest in acquiring 310 St Kilda Road. We are assisting the Victorian government with their due diligence. They have not yet got to the point where they have made an offer to the department. So we are still awaiting that offer. *24 Nov 2018 Senator Alex Gallacher, Q.Is Defence aware of how much it will cost to remediate the site? If yes, how much?. A.Defence has considered the condition of the building in obtaining a sale valuation for the site. Defence does not publicly disclose its valuations, or contributing cost assumptions, ahead of achieving a divestment outcome. *23 Nov 2019 Senator David Van QoN, Q.What is Defence doing to rectify the (disrepair) issues of the site?. A.The site has not been occupied in over 20 years and would require significant refurbishment works to address building safety hazards and building code compliance to enable occupancy. *23 Nov 2019 Senator Kimberley Kitching QON, Q.Can the department provide a status update in relation to the Defence property at 310 St Kilda Road, Melbourne?. A.Defence is currently working with the Council to explore this (off-market sale) opportunity, including interest by the (Melbourne City) Council in exploring the feasibility of an outcome to support a range of veteran‚Äôs wellbeing services. In its response to Questions on Notice from the 30 May 2018 Senate Estimates, Defence indicated the sale is progressing in accordance with the Commonwealth Property Disposal Policy (CPDP). Defence also indicated the site was surplus to Defence requirements. On 20 March 2019 the Assistant Minister for Defence, Senator David Fawcett, instructed the Department of Defence to progress the sale of property. When asked by Jon Faine on ABC Radio Melbourne on 25 March 2019, Darren Chester, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, indicated he was supportive of the initiative to establish a cultural institution for veterans wellbeing but unaware of the decision to sell the property despite his ministerial appointment. Senator Fawcett reversed the decision on 28 March 2019 prior to caretaker period for the 2019 Federal Election commencing on 10 April 2019. As an expression of tri-party support the three primary candidates for the Division of Macnamara in the 2019 Federal election, Josh Burns (ALP), Kate Ashmor (Liberal) and Steph Hodgins-May (Greens), publicly endorsed the initiative to create a cultural institution for veterans wellbeing during a community forum on 16 April 2019., \\"It‚Äôs a worthy project\\", Josh Burns said. \\"I see the vision and it touches on some of the desperate health challenges that veterans are facing and it does it in a way that is admirable and is worthy of support.\\" Amanda Rishworth released the Australian Labor Party's 2019 election veterans policy re-stating that \\"it is a site of significance for many in the veterans' and ex-serving community\\" and committing to its future for the benefit of the veteran community on 10 May 2019.

Lesbians have historically faced challenges relating to the sexual discrimination against women as well as the homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities, although Sri Lanka itself is often considered a leader for women's rights in South Asia.  Human Rights and Legalities  = Penal Code = The sections 365 and 365A proscribe that any unnatural offences or acts of gross indecency between persons should be punished with \\"rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and not exceeding twenty years with a fine and compensation\\". = Vagrants Ordinance = The section 07 of 1841 criminalizes soliciting and acts of indecency in public places, with a punishment of no more than six months and a fine of 100 rupees.  History  During a proposal to decriminalize homosexual sex between males, the parliament decided to criminalize lesbian sex. This perspective was extended to the media when the press council refused to penalize a newspaper that had published letters attacking lesbians. No lesbians were convicted under this law. The IGLHRC found from a two-year long research project that female \\"LBT people faced this frequent violence and daily discrimination without any protection from the state\\". Reuters cited how a 'formerly friendly neighbours threatened two women with rape after discovering they were a lesbian couple.' Some lesbians on sports teams lost their places once they came out.WSG Sri Lanka  Culture  The majority of lesbians communicate and socialize through the internet. Younger lesbians organize parties and gatherings through media such as Facebook and Whatsapp. Various online communities serve as a means for lesbians to find romantic partners.9% of LGBT in Sri Lanka reported they were in a homosexual relationship with another female.Gay Happiness Monitor 2015 Few cultural pursuits are available. Bars and clubs exist that cater exclusively to sexual minorities, including lesbians, but they are far outnumbered by mainstream establishments. A handful of media productions have been made about lesbians. Grass Rooted has created several theatre productions showing lesbians in a positive light. Women are expected to wear a sari. Nonconformity is frowned, although most organizations do not have documented dress codes. Some nationalist movements promoting Sinhlaese ethnolingustic groups attacked the lesbian community, protesting at major events celebrating homosexuality. The influential Buddhist Asgiriya Chapter supports equality for sexual minorities. = Social issues = Reports suggest that lesbians feel unable to openly complain about discrimination due to social stigma. This allows them to be open to abuse from the police despite human rights lawyers and judicial officials stating, \\"police do not have any right to interfere in adults personal sexual choices\\". Another concern is the financial and personal consequences of coming out as a lesbian, fearing that they will be shunned by their family and lose their jobs. The government stated that anti- discrimination laws apply to sexuality. Lesbians generally face a worse climate of ill-treatment at home due to the lower status of women in Sri Lankan society, in particular on unmarried women in rural areas, due to the culture of remaining at home until marriage.SOGIE CPIN 3.0  See also  * Sexual minorities in Sri Lanka References Category:Sexuality in Sri Lanka Category:LGBT in Sri Lanka ","title":"Lesbianism in Sri Lanka"},{"id":"58662681","text":"Lawrence Neil-Smith (born 1 June 1999) is an Australian cricketer.

She was the eldest of seven children. Her education was at Carrig national school before going to secondary school with the Sisters of Mercy in Birr where she then worked as a monitor from October 1884. At the time this was a way to gain a teacher qualification. She completed her training by correspondence and sat the final examination in 1890. She taught for a short time in Tulla Convent in County Clare. Most of her teaching life was spent in Tipperary ‚Äì at Nenagh convent and as principal of Glenculloo. Mahon was principal from September 1891 to April 1892 in a small school with thirty pupils in Glenculloo before moving on to be principal of Carrig national school. Irish National Teachers Organisation Mahon was a member of both the Gaelic League and the Irish Women's Franchise League. While she was a non militant member she expressed support in The Irish Citizen. In 1906 Mahon began her involvement with the teachers trade union and joined the Birr Association and made a speech about equal pay at the Irish National Teachers Organisation annual congress. She then pointed out the lack of women on the INTO executive. Arguing the point she put herself forward for consideration for the position of Vice-President of the association in March 1907 and, although she wasn't elected, the question was so public that the INTO created new positions on the executive for women and offered one to Mahon. In the first years of her involvement Mahon was successful in a number of her goals, she increased recruitment and prevented women teachers being forced to cover Laundry and Cookery as subjects. When the Birrell grant was adopted in the summer of 1908 Mahon pointed out that the principal of equal pay had been established, as the grant was distributed to all teachers. Thus she claimed the precedent was made. In April 1911 she was elected to the position of Vice- President unopposed. That year her goal was to prevent teachers on maternity leave to be required to provide their substitute at their own expense. In 1912 Mahon was elected the first woman president of the INTO. Almost immediately there was a crisis with the dismissal of the vice president Edmond Mansfield and issues between the INTO and the board of education. Mahon was sent to London to request the chief secretary Augustine Birrell to hold an inquiry. Although the secretary was biased against her position, he admitted her statement presented the case well and the Dill commission was set up. Mahon was re-elected in 1913 despite he usual one term assumption. The teachers‚Äô paper, Irish School Weekly in 14 December 1912 claimed \\"the general who has in every encounter routed the enemy's cavalry, must be retained at the head of the forces.\\" This allowed her to give evidence as president to the Dill Commission which went on to vindicate the teachers and recommend changes but refused to recommend the reinstatement of Mansfield. As a result, the following year she resigned from the executive. She stepped down Easter 1916. She was questioned for her vocal support of the Easter rising. An issue which arose in her final year on the executive was the War bonus, which granted men double the pay of women. Mahon protested this and declared success in November 1916. In 1919 she criticized the Education bill by Ian MacPherson and called the INTO executive British apologists. She made similar accusations against INTO's president and the general secretary T. J. O'Connell. As a result in 1920 she was charged with libel. Mahon refused to accept the British court's jurisdiction but once she was silenced the INTO dropped the case. She stayed out of public life on a national level from then on. Another woman was not elected to be president of the INTO until Kathleen Clarke in 1945. Later life Mahon was president of the Tipperary Cottage Tenants‚Äô Association. She was also a member of Fianna F√°il from its foundation. She retired at the end of the school year in July 1934 and went on to be the first woman elected to the county council in North Tipperary where she remained for three years before resigning. After that Mahon moved to Dublin where she lived with her mother and two widowed sisters in Balbriggan from 1937. There she was involved with the local Red Cross. It was there she died and was buried.

The city of the Kingdom of Naples was then defeated and taken by the so-called Sanfedisti, led by cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, after a battle on the city walls. After being defeated, most Altamurans managed to flee from Porta Bari, one of Altamura's main gates. In February 1799, the news that the king had fled to Palermo arrived in Altamura. Altamura population then reorganized and embraced the ideals propagated by the French Revolution. The Liberty Tree was also planted in what it was then called piazza del mercato (today it's called piazza Duomo). In the meantime, the Sanfedisti, led by the cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, were getting closer and closer, determined to restore the Kingdom of Naples and the Bourbons dynasty. The Sanfedisti left Matera and arrived at the gates of Altamura on 9 May 1799. Altamura had already fixed everything before the battle, by closing the secondary city gates, fusing the church bells in order to make new cannons and preparing ammunition. On 9 May, the battle took place, but soon Altamurans ran off of ammunition and they started to shoot coins. This let the enemy realize that the situation inside the city was critical and that they wouldn't last for long. On the night of 9 May 1799, most Altamurans managed to escape from porta Bari (perhaps accidentally or thanks to Ruffo unbeknown to his troops). On the morning of 10 May, Sanfedisti entered Altamura, sacking and slaughtering an unknown number of Altamurans who had remained there. The stay of the Sanfedisti and Ruffo inside the city lasted 14 days, during which Altamurans gradually returned and some of them were killed or imprisoned. By the end of May 1799, the situation had already normalized and Altamura had returned under the full control of the Kingdom of Naples. The number of deaths among Sanfedisti has been estimated at around 1,400 people, but it is not clear how many Altamurans were killed. Some historians estimated the losses among Altamurans from about forty to a hundred people, while other historians suggested that many Altamurans and Neapolitan Jacobin people from other cities may have been counted as Sanfedisti. In this case, the death toll among Altamurans and Parthenopean Republicans would be much higher.

It is a Grade I listed building. The present building is a 1690s remodelling of an earlier building dating from the 16th century. It was later upgraded by the architect William Eden Nesfield, who in 1875 added a new west facing entrance front and a service wing and refaced the east front. The hall is built in brick in 3 storeys with some terracotta detail and slate roofs. The west entrance frontage has 5 bays with a 4-storey projecting porch. The side elevations have 9 bays (arranged 2-1-3-1-2), the south front looking over a parterre. Some of the garden features and outbuildings are also listed. The house and gardens may be visited by the public. History Bodrhyddan traditionally belonged to the Conway family, descending in the male line until the death of the last male heir, Sir John Conway, 2nd Baronet, in 1721. Bodrhyddan then passed via his daughter Penelope to the Stapletons and eventually by marriage to Rev. William Davies Shipley, Dean of St Asaph. The dean's eldest son was killed in a shooting accident and so the Hall passed to his grandson William, who adopted the surname Shipley-Conwy. Captain William Shipley-Conwy never married, and on his death the estate passed to his sister Charlotte, who was married to Richard Thomas Rowley, the second son of Baron Langford of Somerhill, County Meath. It then descended in that family, renamed Rowley-Conwy, to Rafe Grenville Rowley Conwy, who died unmarried in 1951, leaving the estate to his nephew the 9th Baron Langford. Lord Langford died at Bodrhyddan in 2017 at the age of 105 and was succeeded by his son Hon. Owain Grenville Rowley-Conwy.

The viaduct was designed by New South Wales Government Railways and built in 1919. It is also known as Bargo River Railway Viaduct. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  By the early 1900s much of the original single track railways in New South Wales had become inadequate for railway operations, particularly the busy Main Lines (South, West and North) through the Great Dividing Range. Plans were made to duplicate the tracks and at the same time ease the original steep grades and sharp curves, usually all achieved by deviation works. It was a major programme beginning in 1910 and continuing to 1923. The dominant bridge building material was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at Homebush and mostly in the form of brick arches. This was due to (a) a general lack of expensive imported steel and (b) a long standing government policy to see local materials used as much as possible. Even for short spans, , where a simple steel plate web girder would have been the norm, brick arches were built. The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous so the period 1910-23 could be aptly described as the \\"era of brick arch construction\\". Thereafter, locally produced steel, from Newcastle and Port Kembla, displaced the use of bricks for superstructures, but large quantities of bricks continued to be used for piers, abutments and wings walls. In the duplication programme, that of the Main South was the largest. It had been duplicated to Picton by 1892, then from 1913 to 1922 duplication was extended to Cootamundra, a distance of , in sections but not always sequentially. For example the first section from Picton to Bowral was one of the last completed in 1919 whereas the section, Bowral to Goulburn, had been completed in 1915. A design policy of the duplication work was to eliminate level crossings, consequently there are as many underbridges and overbridges for roads as there are underbridges for waterways. Fast, safe, through running was to be the new standard for goods and passenger trains.  Description  A large brick arch viaduct consisting of five spans over the Bargo River. = Condition = As at 16 March 2006, the physical condition is good. The bridge retains its original fabric and structure.  Heritage listing  As at 16 March 2006, the bridge has significance because it is part of the major duplication of the Main South Railway, the use of brick construction complements the natural environment, the duplication work contributed significantly to the continued development of South Western New South Wales, commercially through freight trains and socially through faster, better passenger trains and in the \\"era of brick arch construction\\", 1910‚Äì23, there were around 90 railway sites where brick arches singly and in multiples, for clear spans from were built. But this viaduct has a set of larger brick arches at clear spans. The bridge retains its original fabric and structure. Bargo Railway Viaduct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The bridge is part of the major duplication of the Main South Railway. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge is readily accessible from the Old Hume Highway set in a natural environment. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The duplication work contributed significantly to the continued development of South Western New South Wales, commercially through freight trains and socially through faster, better passenger trains. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. In the \\"era of brick arch construction\\", 1910‚Äì23, there were around 90 railway sites where brick arches singly and in multiples, for clear spans from were built. These structures depend on the bricklayers skills. But this viaduct is one of only a few with larger clear spans of or more. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. A good representative example of brick arch construction.

As a Jew, she was forced to leave Austria following the country's annexation into Nazi Germany in the Anschluss and went to work with the noted geneticist Francis Crew at the Institute of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. She worked at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary during the Second World War and subsequently joined the pharmacology department of the University of Edinburgh and worked as a lecturer in chemistry. Towards the end of her career she worked in obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1973 she received the Golden Honorary Diploma, an honorary degree of the University of Vienna, which was presented to her by Austrian biochemist Hans Tuppy. Early life Regina Kapeller was born on 28 June 1900 in Stanislau (now Ivano-Frankivsk), Galicia, Austria-Hungary. Her father, Moritz Kapeller, was employed by the Canadian Pacific and Royal Mail Lines. Her early education was at a school in Brody, Lviv. In 1928, Regina Kapeller married Dr Ernst Adler (1899‚Äì1970) and they had a daughter, Liselotte Adler (later Mrs Kastner) in 1934. Career University of Vienna, c. 1900 Former buildings of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Kapeller-Adler obtained her doctorate in chemistry from the University of Vienna in 1923 and became a demonstrator at the Institute for Medical Chemistry of the University of Vienna in 1926. She was discouraged from pursuing a habilitation because she was a woman and Jewish, and worked unpaid. In 1934, she developed an innovative chemical test for early pregnancy using the detection of histidine excretion in urine that gained her international recognition. Kapeller-Adler began to study for a medical degree at the University of Vienna in 1934 while working part-time at the Biochemical Laboratory of the Health Insurance Fund from 1935 to 1936. Between 1936 and 1937, she was head of the Laboratory for Clinical and Medical-Chemical Diagnostics of the Sanatoriums Hera in Vienna. After the Anschluss in 1938, during which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Kapeller-Adler and her husband lost their jobs due to being Jewish, and were unable to complete their studies at the university. In 1939, she moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, on the invitation of the English geneticist Francis Crew to work at the Institute of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh, then the only pregnancy diagnosis centre in the United Kingdom. Her husband travelled with her and was briefly interned as an \\"enemy alien\\" before being released and starting a medical practice in Edinburgh in 1943. Kapeller-Adler was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Edinburgh in 1941. She worked at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary from 1940 to 1944. Subsequently, she joined the pharmacology department of the University of Edinburgh and worked as a lecturer in chemistry from 1951 to 1964. Starting in 1968, she worked locally in obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1973 she received the Golden Honorary Diploma, an honorary degree from the University of Vienna, presented to her by Austrian biochemist Hans Tuppy.

Location  Located just two kilometres from the Gaocun exit of the Jingjintang Expressway, Taitou offers excellent transportation links to Beijing and Tianjin. Taitou is a vibrant community of relocated farmers surrounded by agricultural land and thousands of vacant new buildings. Many of the empty buildings in the surrounding area were constructed during a speculative real estate bubble in the early 2010s. While occupancy rates in Taitou are very high, occupancy rates of housing and shopping malls in the surrounding area are still extremely low. The surrounding area could be described as a Chinese ghost city. In late 2018, house prices dropped from 15,384 Chinese yuan per square metre to 11,771 Chinese yuan per square metre in just two months.

Only SF Express, JD.com and China Post deliver mail to addresses in Taitou. Other couriers usually deposit Taitou-addressed mail at Hexiwu (11 km away), Gaocun (3 km away) or Haileybury International School (1.25 km away) and notify the intended recipient of the item's location by SMS. JD.com has a near monopoly for online groceries because it is the only online grocery company willing to ship to Taitou. JD.com's grocery products (which include cabbages, eggs, electronic items and frozen fish) are available for same-day or next-day delivery to Taitou.  Map  Annotated map of Taitou residential compound  Air quality  The air quality as measured by the air quality index (AQI) in nearby Langfang varies from excellent to severely polluted. In summer months, the AQI is usually around 100, while in winter months, AQI of 300+ is common. In May 2017, the AQI of Langfang and other cities in the Jingjinji area exceeded an extremely hazardous 1000 points. Green: lowest AQI each month; blue: average AQI each month; maroon: highest AQI each month. Higher numbers indicate more polluted air.The lack of an extremely polluted winter in 2017/18 is owed to policies from the central Chinese government that placed severe restrictions on heavily-polluting manufacturing plants and coal furnaces used for heating.  Renovation process of 2016-17  Black waterproof layer has been applied to the exterior walls of all 21 buildings at Taitou residential compound. Walls are now ready for stencilling with masking tape and beige paint.Major renovation works were carried out at Taitou residential compound from 2016-17Shortly after construction of the Taitou residential compound was completed, and after residents had moved in, major renovation works were carried out on the exterior walls of all 21 buildings at Taitou. The process included: # Chipping away the existing stone cladding # Removing the old Rockwool insulation material from the external walls # Installing new, upgraded Rockwool insulation material to the external walls # Painting the exterior walls white # Painting the exterior walls black # Covering every face of every building with masking tape in a brickwork pattern # Painting the buildings beige then peeling off the masking tape to reveal a brickwork pattern The exterior wall renovation process took nearly 12 months to complete, during which, the compound was littered with dust, rubble and debris. After the exterior wall insulation was finished, workers planted hundreds of trees and bushes around the residential compound. Haileybury International School used some of the Taitou debris as material for its elective handicraft activity.

Mutange Dam is 42 km by road from Gokwe and 49 km from Empress, 117 km from Kadoma and 146 km from Kwekwe via Empress (147 km via Zhombe Joel). It is owned and operated by the Ministry of Water Resources and Development. Background Mutange Dam was constructed mainly to augment fossil borehole water supply to Gokwe Centre. It has a capacity of 4.950 million m¬≥. Initially, the estimated cost of construction of the dam was $8,224,504.00 (2010-2014), but because of economic constraints faced by Zimbabwe contraction which took too long to complete, it cost over $130 million due to inflation and other economic and political challenges. The dam construction was finally completed in 2016. Mutange Dam in Gokwe East, Chisina Village, Zimbabwe Operations The Mapfungautsi Plateau's Masoro Descent in Gokwe is the main drainage basin for surface runoff into the source tributaries of the Mutange River, the escapement southwest of the Mutange Dam. Mutange River has its source right up the plateau just about 1.5 km east of the Kwekwe-Gokwe Highway (). Mutange River is a tributary of the Sanyati River, which drains into the Zambezi River. Beneficiaries Mutange dam provides drinking water for both livestock and human beings. Apart from the villagers affected by the dam construction, who had to be resettled elsewhere by the government at about US$1.9 million, the rest of the community welcomed its long term benefits. =Mutange Dam Hydro Power Station= Electric pumps powered from the up-to-33 kV Mutange Hydro Power Station are set at Mutange Dam to drive raw water for over 30 km to Gokwe town, the dam's chief beneficiary. Locally, the power station drives water to Mutange Irrigation Scheme, Chisina Township and the surrounding rural villages. =Mutange Irrigation Scheme= Mutange Dam is in Zimbabwe's Agro-Ecological Region, where the average annual rainfall is 550 mm. Irrigation is therefore a critical investment in the area. Mutange Dam's immediate major beneficiary is the Mutange Irrigation Scheme. Pumping and conveyance systems at Mutange Dam connects the irrigation scheme by a pipeline running 1,500 m to the field edge of the scheme's 134 hectares of arable land. =Chisina Township= Chisina Township, named after the Chisina chieftain, 750 m east of Mtange Dam, depends on the dam for water supply. () The township is in Mapfungautsi Parliamentary Constituency, Gokwe South District. Modern houses, including Chief Chisina's court hall, have been built in the village. The building of the court hall might be government approval of the Chisina chieftaincy which has been in limbo for almost 70 years in conflict with the neighbouring Njelele chieftaincy. Originally Gumbero, alias Chisina, had been chief of the better part of the Mapfungautsi area, then Sebungwe East, the area bounded by Ngondoma and Munyati rivers in the east and southeast. These two major natural boundaries separate Gokwe East district from Mashonaland West Province in the east and Kwekwe District of the Midlands Province in the southeast Chief Chisina's original area of jurisdiction. The Chisina (Gumbero) chieftaincy is traceable as far back to the early 18th century when Chihwechematanda founded it on his arrival from Buhera in the now Mashonaland East Province. The second Chief Gumbero was Mataruka, the third was Makuvidziri, the fourth was Chinengwere and the fifth was Mudyachawaona who was downgraded to a headman under Chief Njelele by the Rhodesian government in the 1940s. The 6th Chief Gumbero, the first to be nicknamed Chief Chisina, was Tendaupenyu. When the then government asked him to identify his boundaries which Chief Njelele had crossed, he claimed, \\"Ndave nechigaro CHISINA chinhu,\\" meaning, \\"My throne is left with nothing\\". From thence he was mocked CHISINA, and he accepted the mock as a way of protest. The Zimbabwean government is yet to amicably solve the Chief Njelele-Chief Chisina conflict.
