The work is more than four meters tall, and shows some of the horror of the wartime destruction visited on the Island of Chios in the Chios massacre. A frieze-like display of suffering characters, military might, ornate and colourful costumes, terror, disease and death is shown in front of a scene of widespread desolation. Unusual for a painting of civil ruin during this period, The Massacre at Chios has no heroic figure to counterbalance the crushed victims, and there is little to suggest hope among the ruin and despair. The vigour with which the aggressor is painted, contrasted with the dismal rendition of the victims has drawn comment since the work was first hung, and some critics have charged that Delacroix might have tried to show some sympathy with the brutal occupiers.Delacroix, Lee Johnson, W.W.Norton & Company, Inc., New York, 1963. Page 19. The painting was completed and displayed at the Salon of 1824 and presently hangs at the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris.Mus√©e du Louvre Massacre A military attack on the inhabitants of Chios by Ottoman forces commenced on 11 April 1822 and was prosecuted for several months into the summer of the same year. The campaign resulted in the deaths of twenty thousand citizens, and the forced deportation into slavery of almost all the surviving seventy thousand inhabitants.Haskell, Francis. \\"Chios, the Massacres, and Delacroix\\".

(See The Paintings of Eug√®ne Delacroix: A Critical Catalogue, 1816‚Äì1831, Volume One, Lee Johnson, Oxford University Press, 1981. Page 86.) Composition Delacroix had been greatly impressed by his fellow Parisien Th√©odore G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa, a painting for which he himself modeled as the young man at the front with the outstretched arm. The pyramidal arrangement that governs G√©ricault's painting is similarly seen with the figures in the foreground of The Massacre at Chios.Delacroix, Rene Huyghe (translated by Jonathan Griffin), Thames and Hudson, London, 1963. Pages 120, 121. On this unlikely layout of characters, Delacroix commented, \\"One must fill up; if it is less natural, it will be more beautiful and f√©cond. Would that everything should hold together!\\"Journal de Eug√®ne Delacroix, Tome I, 1822‚Äì1852, Andr√© Joubin, Librairie Plon, 8 rue Garanci√®re, Paris, 1932, entry for 9 May 1824. Page 96. The dense assembly of characters at the front is in marked contrast to the open and dispersed spaces behind them. Land and sea, light and shade run appear as bands of drifting colours listlessly running into each other, and Delacroix appears to abandon the laws of perspective altogether with his rendering of clouds. The complete effect of this background is to suggest a constant opening out, dissolution and centrelessness. Aesthetician Heinrich W√∂lfflin identified this technique, and classified it a tectonic form.Delacroix, Rene Huyghe (translated by Jonathan Griffin), Thames and Hudson, London, 1963. Pages 128, 129. Compositional structure of two human pyramids The thirteen civilians‚Äîmen, women and children‚Äìhave been rounded up for slaughter or enslavement. They are harshly presented to the viewer in an almost flat plane; slumped, disordered, and unevenly distributed. Their arrangement principally comprises two human pyramids‚Äìone pyramid to the left of the canvas culminating in the man with the red fez, and the other to the right culminating in the mounted soldier. The area between the two pyramids contains two soldiers in shadow, and two more Greek victims‚Äìa young man embraced by a young woman. The two men in the pyramid to the left are injured. The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them. This seeming detachment, coupled with the vacant stare of the dying man lend to this group an air of despondent resignation. Figure of the old woman at the foot of the painting Detail from Delacroix's study Head of a Woman, 1823. In contrast, the human pyramid to the right has a vigorous vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But at the foot of the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant. Of the rear, Elisabeth A. Fraser notes that \\"[t]he background cuts through the centre of the composition and drops inexplicably out and back from the cluster of [foreground] figures.\\" This dramatic arrangement breaks the picture apart into fragments, with clumps of tangled bodies, scattered glances and other details competing for the viewers attention.Interpreting Delacroix in the 1820s: Readings in the art criticism and politics of Restoration France, Elisabeth A. Fraser, Yale University, 1993, Chapter Three, Delacroix's Massacres of Chios: Convenance, Violence, and the viewer in 1824\\\\. Page 65\\\\. See also Elisabeth Fraser, Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France (Cambridge University Press, 2004). In the middle distance, another m√™l√©e of humanitarian disaster unfolds, and the background is an uneven display of sacked, burning settlements and scorched earth. Most of the Mediterranean horizon is painted with bleak earth colours, and it is punctuated only by smoke, the mane of the rearing horse and the head of the soldier. Figures Delacroix reveals over a number of weeks' entries in his Journal a desire to try to get away from the academically sound and muscular figures of his previous work Dante and Virgil in Hell.Delacroix, Lee Johnson, W.W.Norton & Company, Inc., New York, 1963. Page 20.Journal de Eug√®ne Delacroix, Tome I, 1822‚Äì1852, Andr√© Joubin, Librairie Plon, 8 rue Garanci√®re, Paris, 1932, entry for 11 April 1824.

Two studies Delacroix worked on at this time, Head of a Woman and Girl Seated in a Cemetery, show the combination of unexaggerated modelling and accented contour he was striving to incorporate into his larger work. The final treatment of figures in the Massacre is however less consistent than these two studies. The flesh of the dead (or dying) man at the front is for instance strongly colouristically rendered, contrasting with the more tonal modelling of the nude to the right, and the Veronese-like schematic modelling of the baby.The Paintings of Eug√®ne Delacroix, A Critical Catalogue, 1816‚Äì1831, Volume One, Lee Johnson, Oxford University Press, 1981. Page 87. History On 15 September 1821, Delacroix wrote to his friend Raymond Soulier that he wanted to make a reputation for himself by painting a scene from the war between the Ottomans and the Greeks, and have this painting displayed at the Salon. At this time Delacroix was not famous, and had yet to paint a canvas that was to be hung for public display. In the event, he decided to paint his Dante and Virgil in Hell, but even as this painting was revealed to the public in April 1822, the atrocities at Chios were being meted out in full force. In May 1823, Delacroix committed to paint a picture about the massacre. When the Salon of 1824 opened on 25 August‚Äîan unusually late date for this institution‚ÄîDelacroix's picture was shown there as exhibit no. 450 and entitled Sc√®nes des massacres de Scio; familles grecques attendent la mort ou l'esclavage, etc. (English:Scenes of massacres at Chios; Greek families awaiting death or slavery, etc..) The painting was hung in the same room that housed Ingres' The Vow of Louis XIII. This display of two works exemplifying such different approaches to the expression of form marked the beginning of the public rivalry between the two artists. Delacroix thought this was the moment the academy began to regard him as an \\"object of antipathy\\".Piron, Eug√®ne Delacroix, sa vie et ses ≈ìuvres, Claye, Paris, 1865. (see The Paintings of Eug√®ne Delacroix, A Critical Catalogue, 1816‚Äì1831, Volume One, Lee Johnson, Oxford University Press, 1981. Page 87.) Alexandre Dumas reported that \\"there is always a group in front of the picture ..., painters of every school engaged in heated discussion\\". Both Dumas and Stendhal remarked that they thought the picture was a depiction of a plague, which in part it was. Gros, from whose Plague of Jaffa Delacroix had noticeably borrowed, called it \\"the massacre of painting\\".The Massacre of Chios, Delacroix, A Gallery of Masterpieces, with an essay by Paul-Henry Michel, Assistant Keeper at the Biblioth√®que Magazine, Max Parrish & Co.

Ingres said the painting exemplified the 'fever and epilepsy' of modern art.Histoire des artistes vivant, T. Silvestre, 1855, with reprints the same year under different titles. (see The Paintings of Eug√®ne Delacroix, A Critical Catalogue, 1816‚Äì1831, Volume One, Lee Johnson, Oxford University Press, 1981. Page 88.) Critics Girodet and Thiers were, however, more flattering, and the painting was sufficiently well regarded for the state to purchase it the same year for the Mus√©e du Luxembourg for 6000 francs. The purchase provoked internal conflicts in the Restoration arts administration, however, when the Comte de Forbin, director of the royal museums, bought the painting without the King's official approval, an irregular and politically risky procedure.Elisabeth Fraser, \\"Uncivil Alliances: Delacroix, the Private Collector, and the Public,\\" Oxford Art Journal 21: 1 (1998): 87‚Äì103.

In Greece Naturally, Delacroix's painting aroused considerable attention in Greece. A draft of this painting, created under the supervision of Delacroix in his lab by one of his students, is in display in the Athens War Museum. In 2009, a copy of the painting was displayed in the local Byzantine museum on Chios. It was withdrawn from the museum on November 2009 in a \\"good faith initiative\\" for the improvement of Greek-Turkish relations. However, the Greek press protested its removal.Chios Complete Guide . The copy is now back on display in the museum.

This huge volcano has produced two of the world‚Äôs most violent eruptions in geologically recent times. The Taupo Volcano forms part of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, a region of volcanic activity that extends from Ruapehu in the South, through the Taupo and Rotorua districts, to White Island, in the Bay of Plenty region. Taupo began erupting about 300,000 years ago, but the main eruptions that still affect the surrounding landscape are the Oruanui eruption, about 26,500 years ago, which is responsible for the shape of the modern caldera, and the Hatepe eruption, dated 232 ¬± 5 CE. However, there have been many more eruptions, with major ones every thousand years or so (see timeline of last 10,000 years of eruptions).A continent on the move: New Zealand geoscience into the 21st century.

Some volcanoes within the Taupo Volcanic Zone have erupted far more recently, however, notably a violent VEI-5 eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886, and frequent activity of Whakaari/White Island, which erupted most recently in December 2019.

If the magma does not contain much gas, rhyolite tends to just form a lava dome. However, when mixed with gas or steam, rhyolitic eruptions can be extremely violent. The magma froths to form pumice and ash, which is thrown out with great force. If the volcano creates a stable plume, high in the atmosphere, the pumice and ash is blown sideways, and eventually falls to the ground, draping the landscape like snow. If the material thrown out cools too rapidly, and becomes denser than the air, it cannot rise as high, and suddenly collapses back to the ground, forming a pyroclastic flow, hitting the surface like water from a waterfall, and spreading sideways across the land at enormous speed. When the pumice and ash settles, it is sufficiently hot to stick together as a rock called ignimbrite. Pyroclastic flows can travel hundreds of kilometres an hour.  Earlier eruptions  Earlier ignimbrite eruptions occurred further north than Taupo. Some of these were enormous, and two eruptions around 1.25 and 1.0 million years ago were big enough to generate an ignimbrite sheet that covered the North Island from Auckland to Napier. While Taupo has been active for 300,000 years, explosive eruptions became more common 65,000 years ago.  Oruanui eruption  A large eruption column during the Oruanui eruption as it may have appeared from space The Oruanui eruption of the Taupo Volcano was the world's largest known eruption in the past 70,000 years, with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8. It occurred around 26,500 years ago and generated approximately 430 km¬≥ of pyroclastic fall deposits, 320 km¬≥ of pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits (mostly ignimbrite) and 420 km¬≥ of primary intracaldera material, equivalent to 530 km¬≥ of magma. Modern Lake Taupo partly fills the caldera generated during this eruption. Tephra from the eruption covered much of the central North Island with ignimbrite up to 200 metres deep. Most of New Zealand was affected by ashfall, with even an 18 cm ash layer left on the Chatham Islands, 1,000 km away. Later erosion and sedimentation had long-lasting effects on the landscape, and caused the Waikato River to shift from the Hauraki Plains to its current course through the Waikato to the Tasman Sea.  Hatepe eruption  The Taupo eruption's three main vents ran parallel to Lake Taupo's current southeastern shore. The Taupo eruption (also known as the Hatepe eruption) represents the most recent major eruption of the Taupo Volcano, and occurred about 1,800 years ago. It represents the most violent eruption in the world in the last 5,000 years.\\"Taupo the eruption\\" (a single sheet pamphlet), C.J.N. Wilson and B.F. Houghton, Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences, c2004.Wilson, C.J.N. and Walker, G.P.L., 1985. The Taup≈ç eruption, New Zealand I. General aspects. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, A314: 199-228. =Stages of eruption= The eruption went through several stages. *A minor eruption occurred beneath the ancestral Lake Taupo. *A dramatic increase in activity produced a high eruption column from a second vent, and pumice was deposited over a wide area. *Water entered the first vent, and mixed with the magma, producing a white ash-rich pumice fall. *A new vent formed, and produced a dark ash- and obsidian-rich fall deposit. *A larger eruption ensued, producing pumice over a huge area, and a small ignimbrite deposit. *The most destructive part of the eruption then occurred. Part of the vent area collapsed, unleashing about 30 km¬≥ of material, that formed a fast moving (600‚Äì900 km/h) pyroclastic flow. * Rhyolitic lava domes were extruded some years later, forming the Horomatangi reefs and Waitahanui bank.Houghton, B.F. (2007). Field Guide - Taupo Volcanic Zone. The main pyroclastic flow devastated the surrounding area, climbing over 1500 metres (5000 ft) to overtop the nearby Kaimanawa Ranges and Mount Tongariro, and covering the land within with ignimbrite from Rotorua to Waiouru. Only Ruapehu was high enough to divert the flow. The power of the pyroclastic flow was so strong that in some places it eroded more material off the ground surface than it replaced with ignimbrite. Valleys were filled with ignimbrite, evening out the shape of the land. All vegetation within the area was flattened. Loose pumice and ash deposits formed lahars down all the main rivers. The eruption further expanded the lake, which had formed after the much larger Oruanui eruption. The previous outlet was blocked, raising the lake 35 metres above its present level until it broke out in a huge flood, flowing for more than a week at roughly 200 times the Waikato River's current rate. =Dating the Taupo eruption= Many dates have been given for the Taupo eruption. One estimated date is 181 CE from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica.Lake Taupo Official Site It is possible that the meteorological phenomena described by Fan Ye in China and by Herodian in Rome were due to this eruption, which would give a date of exactly 186. However, ash from volcanic activity does not normally cross hemispheres,Iridium: tracking down the extraterrestrial element in sedimentary clays and recent radiocarbon dating by R. Sparks has put the date at 233 CE +/- 13 (95% confidence). There was no local population at this time, so the nearest humans would have been those in Australia, more than 2000 km to the west.

The extensive military scenes are commemorating his military victories,Time-Life Books, 1993. p. 28, (28-29). and the hieroglyphic text explains the specifics of the events. Above the clasped Libyan fighter is one column of text, (out of a series of about 15 columns, variable in height), describing the \\"victory-buildings\\", the strongholds that the captives will be confined in. The text explains that Ramses and the Egyptian army went after three groups of rebels, and then confined them. \\"Smiting Libyan\\" portion of extensive military relief section, Great Temple of Abu Simbel.

It straddles the border between the village of Kiyokawa, town of Aikawa and the former town of Tsukui (now part of the city of Sagamihara). History The potential of the Sagami River for hydroelectric power development began to be developed in the 1930s, with the growth of industry and electrical consumption in the Yokohama-Kanagawa industrial belt. Work on the Sagami Dam, the first dam on the main stream of the Sagami River began in 1938; however, lack of funding and the advent of World War II delayed completion until after the end of the war. Work on the Shiroyama Dam was completed in 1965. The growth in population of nearby Atsugi and increased need for industrial and drinking water spurred plans for additional dams on the Sagami River's tributaries. Plans for the Miyagase Dam were finalized in 1969 with work commencing in 1971. Due to the huge size of the dam, and the need relocate some 300 households from the area flooded by the dam, construction was not completed until the year 2000. Design The Miyagase Dam is a hollow-core concrete gravity dam. It was designed and built by a consortium of the Kajima Construction, Obayashi Corp. and the Toda Corporation. The dam was designed as a multi-purpose dam. In addition to providing flood control, it provides 90% of the tap water to two-thirds of the population of Kanagawa Prefecture, including the cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama and Yokosuka. It also provides water to the associated Aikawa Hydroelectric Power Plant, which has a rated capacity of 24,000 KW of power. The tall dam is the second tallest in the Kant≈ç region. Miyagase Dam is the highest and the largest roller-compacted concrete dam in Japan. The reservoir created by the dam, is a popular recreation spot in Kanagawa Prefecture.

Available via Google Books For most of modern history the Preakness Range remained a wilderness providing recreation to the inhabitants of surrounding towns. Only the southern section of the range was particularly built up, with William Paterson University acting as buffer to hold back development from encroaching northward across the main ridge of Preakness Mountain. In the 1980s, when development began to threaten the remaining wilderness of the range, a push by local citizens to preserve the Preakness Range for the public interest was begun, ultimately resulting in the creation of High Mountain Park Preserve.North Jersey Record Obituaries ‚Äì Ethel Kauffman, open space activist. Note: Ethel Kauffman organized a group which blocked residential development on High Mountain. Geology The Preakness Range formed as molten rock extruded onto the surface 200 million years ago. At that time the range occupied the northern section of an active rift valley running through northern and central New Jersey and part of Pennsylvania. After the rift failed in the early Jurassic, the range was elevated as erosion removed the sandstone and shale surrounding the basalt lava flows of Preakness Mountain and Packanack Mountain.U.S. Geological Survey - NYC Regional Geology, Mesozoic Basins An interesting trait of the Preakness Range is its alternating north- south valleys. These valleys, which form two major divisions, are a result of three separate eruptive events which laid down three closely spaced basalt ridges which combine to form the main section of the Preakness Range on the northern end of Second Watchung Mountain.USGS Mineral Resources On-Line Spatial Data ‚Äì Preakness Basalt These ridges decrease in height from east to west, which mirrors the order in which the ridges, really successive sheets of lava, were formed.

See Page 24 Watchung Traps ‚Äì Succession of Sheets. Available via Google Books Ecology The Preakness Range may be the most environmentally sensitive section of the Watchungs, hosting a variety of ecologically diverse areas of wilderness. The New Jersey National Heritage Program has given the Preakness Range a rating of B2, meaning it has priority as a site with very high biodiversity significance. Nine different ecological communities have been cited in the Preakness Range, including globally imperiled trap rock glade communities and increasingly rare hickory-ash red cedar woodlands. Seven state-listed endangered plant species call the Preakness Range home, including a globally endangered species, Torrey's mountain mint (Pycnanthemum torrei). Twelve other rare plants survive in forested uplands and the range's perched wetlands. Some of the rare plants are reasoned to take root in the range due to the calcareous secondary minerals in the range's trap rock which may serve to increase soil alkalinity relative to the surrounding acidic soils of the piedmont region. The mountains of the Preakness Range also provide significant habitat to wildlife. In particular, sixty species of birds are thought to breed in the range's various environs.

A report was subsequently published, drawing attention to the issues of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human trafficking among women in South-East Asia. Co-sponsors As well as the UNDP the event was sponsored by: Asian Women‚Äôs Human Rights Council (AWHRC); the Indonesian NGO, Yakeba; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM); United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking (UNIAP); and Asia Pacific Network of people living with HIV (APN +), with financial support from the Japanese Government. The event was arranged in coordination with the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP), which opened on 9 August, also on Bali.  Structure  The event took the form of a \\"symbolic court\\", in which a panel (\\"jury\\") of six experts in the field of legal and human rights heard first-hand testimonies from 22 South-East Asian women who described how they had undergone trafficking, violence and exploitation. There were also presentations of data and analysis on the extent of violation of dignity and human rights experienced by South East Asian women. Those attending included political leaders as well as individuals and groups working to empower women and reduce their vulnerability to trafficking and HIV in the region. Sessions included: human rights of vulnerable communities; public health impact of anti- trafficking legislation; and responses from communities. Conclusion Following the proceedings the Jury issued a statement to the effect that \\"the vulnerabilities of women to trafficking and HIV are rooted in the disproportionate human insecurity, poverty, illiteracy and disempowerment that they face in their daily lives\\". They added that some women who are trafficked are treated as illegal migrants, prosecuted as criminals, or denied their rights. The event resulted in a report, \\"The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement\\", published by the UNDP the following January, with the aim of promoting further discussion and action on issues relating to HIV and human trafficking among women in South-East Asia.

Ann Hui adapted another Eileen Chang novel thirteen years later in Eighteen Springs. Plot The film is set in 1940s Shanghai and Hong Kong. Bai Liu-Su (Cora Miao) is an introverted divorc√©e who has her fair share of misery after breaking up with her good-for-nothing husband. Her large, extended family feels she has shamed them through divorce. Her situation at home has become unbearable. A charming Malayan businessman based in Hong Kong, Fan Liu-yuan (Chow Yun-Fat), who is always surrounded by women, happens to visit Shanghai and becomes interested in Bai after chancing on her through mutual friends. Fan sees in Bai what many others don't and tries his best to make her fall in love again. A middle-aged couple tries to matchmake the two. Bai takes a gamble and decides to visit Hong Kong with the Japanese invasion of China looming, willing to risk all just to get out of her awkward family situation; even though she falls for Fan, future is uncertain.

Though unremarkable at first and virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the litter, Pretzel soon grew to be extraordinarily long, much longer than his brothers and sisters. He grew to be the longest dachshund in the world, earning a blue ribbon at a dog show. Pretzel was so long that he could in fact twist his body into the shape of his namesake.Brief summary and reader reviews at Librarything.com His length and physical prowess drew attention and praise from humans and dogs alike, save for one female dachshund named Greta. Pretzel was smitten by Greta who lived just across the street and who was unimpressed by Pretzel's length; she claimed that she \\"didn't like long dogs.\\" Brief summary at Castlemerebooks.com Despite Pretzel's efforts to woo her with gifts, she continued to snub his affections. While watching Greta from afar, Pretzel witnessed Greta's accidental fall into a dry water well. The well was too deep for Greta to escape on her own, but not so deep that Pretzel couldn't hook onto the rim of the well with his hindquarters, lower his body into the well and extract her with his teeth via the scruff of her neck.

The majority of the museum's exhibitions are devoted to the archaeology of Syria, with most of the finds coming from archaeological sites of the northern part of the country. History of the museum In 1931, under the decision of the Syrian authorities, a small Ottoman palace was designated to become the National Museum in the city of Aleppo. After three decades, the building became too small to host the growing number of exhibited items. Therefore, it was decided in 1966 to demolish the old palace building and replace it with a larger, more modern structure. Construction of the new building commenced after Yugoslav architects Zdravko Bregovac and Vjenceslav Richter's project proposal won first price for their competition entry.Martina Munivrana, Vesna Me≈°triƒá (ed): Richter - Rebel With a Wision, Zagreb, 2017., p. 90 In July 2016 the museum was hit by numerous missiles and mortar shells fired by rebel forces.

History =Sylvan Grove Church and Cemetery= Located north of Kylertown on Church Hill Road off of State Route 1011, Sylvan Grove Church and Cemetery remains today as a testament of the faith of the earliest settlers in this area. The church, originally constructed in 1870 for $2010.00, was built on land owned by John and Wealthy Johnson Hoover, and deeded to the Trustees of the Methodist-Episcopal Church. At that time the Trustees were Robert Daugherty, George Hess, David Aldrich, Samuel Hoover, and John Hoover. This building was dedicated on June 25, 1871. This was actually the second church built in this area. The first church was a log building made in 1850, making it the very first church in what was to become Cooper Township. It was across the road from where the current church stands today. The log building church was constructed on land purchased by two of the Hoover brothers, Samuel and John, from Edward and David Gratz. The Hoover brothers then deeded an acre of this land as the building site to the Morris Township School District and the log building was used for both school and church purposes. The founding fathers of the original log church were all four of the Hoover brothers (John and Samuel, George and Jerimiah) as well as Robert Daugherty and George Hess.

The hospital is located at 15521 Russell Avenue, White Rock, British Columbia, Canada, and it's catchment area includes South Surrey. History After World War II, Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster began limiting access to residents from the growing suburban communities such as the then-District of Surrey which included the future (established in 1957) City of White Rock. In 1948, the White Rock Hospital Society formed to fundraise and advocate for government support for creation of a local hospital, while residents of North Surrey and Cloverdale advocated for a hospital in the northern part of the district, which ended up being Surrey Memorial Hospital. The society's fundraising goal was $150,000, one-third of the construction costs as required by the provincial government. Photograph displayed in Peace Arch Hospital of the 1951 sod-turning Construction began in 1951 on land donated by a nearby resident. The 45-bed White Rock District Hospital opened on August 25, 1954. The hospital's name was changed to Peace Arch Hospital. It also eventually was merged into the South Fraser Health Region (SFHR) which also administered health care in Delta, Surrey and Langley. In 2001, PAH came under management of Fraser Health when SFHR was merged with its neighbouring health regions to create a new regional health authority. In 2009, then Minister of Education Margaret MacDiarmid was rushed to PAH for emergency treatment for what was diagnosed as pneumococcal meningitis. MacDiarmid recovered and later was appointed Minister of Health. Fraser Health and the Peach Arch Hospital & Community Health Foundation partnered to complete Peace Arch Hospital Master Concept Plan in 2012. It identified four priority projects: a redeveloped and expanded emergency department, new surgical procedure rooms, a new 200-bed residential care building, and the new 15 bed Peace Arch Hospice. In 2013, Health Minister MacDiarmid announced $3 million in government funding to expand the hospice.

Moral relativism  In 2010, then Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI published a letter (in German and then translated into English) in which he provided a unified perspective on several issues that, together, he believes contributed to the sexual abuse scandal. One of the chief reasons put forth by the Pope was the push by several prominent theologians for a relativistic perspective on morality where \\"there could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; (there could be) only relative value judgments.\\" Seminary training/admissions Clergy themselves have suggested their seminary training offered little to prepare them for a lifetime of celibate sexuality. A report submitted to the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome in 1971, called The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood by Dr. Conrad Baars, a Roman Catholic psychiatrist, and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that some clergy had \\"psychosexual\\" problems. Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, no implementation of the report's detailed recommendations followed. One of those most active in the Synod at the time was Cardinal Wojty≈Ça, who on October 16, 1978 was elected Pope John Paul II. Impact of psychology from previous decades Some bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the practice of returning pedophile priests to their position in the clergy may have been due to the prevailing psychological theories of the time, which suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling.Steinfels, A People Adrift (2003). pp. 40‚Äì6 Thomas G. Plante of Stanford University and Santa Clara University wrote: \\"Almost all the cases coming to light today are cases from 30 and 40 years ago. We did not know much about paedophilia and sexual abuse in general back then. In fact, the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn't emerge until the early 1980s. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake.\\"Plante, Thomas: A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse, San Jose Mercury News, March 24, 2002 (updated online version) Robert S. Bennett, the Washington attorney who headed the National Review Board's research committee, named \\"too much faith in psychiatrists\\" as one of the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases. About 40% of the abusive priests had received counseling before being reassigned. Declining standards in the prevailing culture Some Catholics, such as correspondent John Daniel Davidson, have claimed that the sexual revolution and a rise in moral relativism contributed to the problem of child abuse. Others have argued that child abuse in the Catholic church predates these changes. A report done as part of the Australian government's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that \\"the most notorious cases of sexual abuse in the Australian church occurred in institutional settings in the 1940s‚Äì60s by men (and sometimes women) who were thoroughly trained in the strict morality and rigorous piety of the pre- Vatican II church,\\" noting that \\"the ranks of abusers cuts right across the lines of conservatives and liberals, with both sides having their fair share of abusive clergy.\\" Supply and demand theory It has been argued that the shortage of priests in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient numbers were available to serve the congregation despite serious allegations that these priests were unfit for duty.Catholic Priests in India 'Outsourced' to Meet Clergy Shortage in West ‚Äì 2004-06-11 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n15_v34/ai_20324598 retrieved on July 6, 2007Catholic Priests in India 'Outsourced' to Meet Clergy Shortage in West - 2004-06-11 Pedophilia and ephebophilia Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention (Cimbolic & Cartor, 2006) noted that because of the large share of post-pubescent male minors among cleric victims there is need to further study the differential variables related to ephebophile versus pedophile offenders.Cimbolic & Cartor (2006). Looking at ephebophilia through the lens of priest sexual abuse. Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention, 13(4), 347‚Äì359. Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of the cleric offenders in the John Jay Report are pedophiles; 32 percent ephebophiles, 15 percent 11 & 12 year olds only (both male and female), 20 percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate. They also found distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They reported that there may be ‚Äúanother group of offenders who are more indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a distinct offender category‚Äù and suggested further research to determine ‚Äúspecific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders‚Äù so as to improve the identification and treatment of both offenders and victims.Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008). Differentiating Pedophilia from Ephebophilia in Cleric Offenders. Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity, Volume 15, Issue 4, pages 311 - 319. Gay priests and homosexuality Rome's Congregation for Catholic Education issued an official document, the Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders (2005). The document has attracted criticism based on an interpretation that the document implies that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia and ephebophilia.\\"Statement From The Board Of Directors and Staff of the National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries\\" November 29, 2005. Accessed June 18, 2007 In a statement, read out by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi in 2009, the Holy See stated that the majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as pedophiles, but as homosexuals.22 September 2009 statement, read out by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi on behalf of the Holy See The statement said that rather than pedophilia, \\"it would be more correct to speak of ephebophilia, being a homosexual attraction to adolescent males.\\" The move angered many gay rights organizations and sex abuse victims groups, who claimed it was an attempt by the Vatican to redefine the Church's past problems with pedophilia as problems with homosexuality. According to the John Jay Report 80.9% of the alleged abuse victims in the United States were male.John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The Nature and Scope of the Problem of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests and Deaconsin the United States: 4.3 Characteristics of children who alleged sexual abuse by Catholic priests. p. 69 This fact led Catholic League's William Donohue, to opine: \\"The conventional wisdom maintains there is a pedophilia crisis in the Catholic Church; I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along.\\" Margaret Smith, a John Jay College criminologist who worked on the report, pointed out that it is ‚Äúan unwarranted conclusion‚Äù to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though ‚Äúthe majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature [...] participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man.‚Äù She further stated that \\"the idea of sexual identity [should] be separated from the problem of sexual abuse. ...[A]t this point, we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now.‚Äù All victims in the John Jay report were minors, the \\"vast majority\\" age 13 or younger, considered prepubescent by the American Psychiatric Association. Research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual. Additionally the John Jay report noted that \\"the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church.\\" Another researcher, Louis Schlesinger, argued that the main problem was pedophilia or ephebophilia, not sexual orientation and claimed that some men who are married to adult women are attracted to adolescent males. ‚ÄúIt's important to separate the sexual identity and the behavior,‚Äù said Karen Terry, a second researcher. ‚ÄúSomeone can commit sexual acts that might be of a homosexual nature but not have a homosexual identity.‚Äù Terry said factors such as greater access to boys is one reason for the skewed ratio. Smith also raised the analogy of prison populations where homosexual behavior is common even though the prisoners are not necessarily homosexuals, or cultures where men are rigidly segregated from women until adulthood, and homosexual activity is accepted and then ceases after marriage. Analyzing a number of studies, Gregory M. Herek, a psychology professor at the University of California at Davis, concluded: ‚ÄúThe empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so. ...Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.‚Äù In an interview with CNN, James Cantor, Editor-in-Chief of Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment said, \\"It's quite solidly shown in the scientific literature that there is absolutely no association between being a gay man and being a pedophile.\\" Clerical celibacy Roman Catholic tradition for the last 1000 years, though not before,Barstow, Anne Llewellyn. Married Priests and the Reforming Papacy. NY: Edwin Mellen Press, 1982, p. 45 dictates that only unmarried men can be ordained into the Catholic priesthood, a practice known as clerical celibacy. In modern parlance, celibacy has come to be associated with the very specific practice of abstaining from sexuality. According to modern church teachings, clergy are expected to adhere to both these practices. Exceptions to this rule are sometimes made in very specific instances, such as married converts.Such exceptions are typically applied in the case of Protestant clergy who later convert to Catholicism, see Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church) A 2005 article in the Western People, a conservative Irish newspaper, proposed that celibacy itself had contributed to the abuse problem. There is a suggestion that the institution of celibacy has created a \\"morally superior\\" status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests. According to this paper, \\"The Irish Church‚Äôs prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society.\\"Western People, 2 Nov. 2005 Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church.. Most observers of the current situation who work in everyday parish settings agree that there is abundant anecdotal evidence that suggests there is a direct causative relationship between celibacy and/or homosexuality and the sexual victimization of children in the Church, even as it is vehemently denied by the hierarchy and their \\"expert\\" consultants. Abuse is almost certainly been a problem during the first thousand years of church history as well as the second. The higher one observes church leadership the louder and shrill is the denial of such an obvious example of cause and effect. Most information available involves male adolescents of the age of 11 years and older which is the age group most frequently abused. It has been asserted that for some priests the development of their sexual feelings stopped changing when they entered celibacy, so they act as if they were adolescents themselves. An Australian public inquiry panel claimed that priests being celibate may have also contributed to abuse. =Advocacy for mandatory celibacy= Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry. Supporters of clerical celibacy suggest, then, that there is some other factor at work. In the Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church, married men may become priests. Because priestly celibacy is a discipline, and not a doctrine of the Church, the discipline of celibacy within the Latin Rite may be lifted in the future, although that is currently unlikely. In the Latin Rite now, only a dispensation from the Vatican can allow clergy within the Latin Rite to marry, and such occasions are rare. The reintroduction of a permanent diaconate means that married men may become deacons in the Western rite but not become priests. =Revelations of widespread heterosexual sex among clergy= On February 19, 2019, the Vatican acknowledged that some clergy maintained their clerical state after violating their vow of celibacy and engaging in heterosexual sex. Some of these clergy had also fathered children.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/vatican-reveals-secret- rules-for-priests-who-father-childrenhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-of- catholic-priests-vatican-confirms-secret-catholic-church-guidelines-for- priests-who-father-children/ During the course of history, the Vatican also adopted rules to protect these clergy as well. Male culture of the church Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia wrote in L'Osservatore Romano that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place however due to its nature of religious values women are limited in its influence so this is only a theory.

He served as State Superintendent of the Missouri Writer's Project, producing Missouri: The WPA Guide to the \\"Show Me\\" State in 1941. He served as director of the Missouri Historical Society from 1946‚Äì1962, and as president of the American Alliance of Museums from 1961‚Äì1962. From 1966‚Äì1976, van Ravenswaay served as director of the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum and Gardens.  Personal life and education  Born in Boonville, Missouri, van Ravenswaay attended Washington University in St. Louis graduating with an A.B. in 1933 and MA in 1934. He received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Maryville College of the Sacred Heart, St. Louis in 1968 and an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the University of Missouri in 1980. In addition to his written and political career, Ravenswaay spent a bit of his youth serving in World War II. As a Navy commander in the Pacific, he met many different people from different cultures. In particular, he wrote home to his friends and family that he was fascinated with the customs of the aboriginal Australians. Throughout his life, Ravenswaay spent much time studying the history and tradition of the St. Louis area. His hobbies for learning about the history and botany began early on in his life. From a very young age, he studied the architecture and decoration within many of the prominent historic buildings. He befriended many of families who were the descendants of many St. Louis prominent families, and listened to their oral traditions and stories from the past. Likewise, Ravenswaay was very passionate about botany and landscape, and so many of his works includes his reflections on his point of view on such activities. In one of his travels, he took the time of identified the flowers, garden crops, and grape varieties that have been brought over from Germany to the vicinity of Hermann, Missouri. He even said that he believed it to be possible to develop historic gardens and grape arbors based on the plants that he identified in the early 1800s German community.  Written Work  Van Ravenswaay has published four books: The Arts and Architecture of German Settlements in Missouri: A Survey of a Vanishing Culture (University of Missouri Press, 1977); A Nineteenth Century Garden (Main Street Press/Universe Books, 1977); Drawn from Nature. The Botanical Art of Joseph Prestele and His Sons (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1984); and St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865 (Missouri Historical Society Press, 1991). In addition, he co- authored the book A Guide to the Show Me State in 1941. Each has been recognized in its own right for its historical acumen and depictions. Though perhaps not having reach the national notierity that some of their competitors did, each of Ravenswaay's books contain a lifetime of study and passion. His books Drawn from Nature and the history of apple cultivation (currently in the works of publishing by the Winterthur Museum) were the result of Ravenswaay's great passion for gardening and botany while his passion for historical buildings and decorative arts led to his writing of The Arts and Architecture of German Settlements in Missouri.

She was one of the last surviving members of the Croatian-Hungarian Zrinski/Zr√≠nyi noble family. She was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, the niece of both Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi and Fran Krsto Frankopan and the wife of Francis R√°k√≥czi I and Imre Th√∂k√∂ly, as well as the mother of Francis R√°k√≥czi II. She is remembered in history for her Defense of Palanok Castle against the Imperial army in 1685-1688, an act for which she was regarded a heroine in Hungary. Life =Early years and family= Ilona was born Jelena Zrinska in Ozalj, Croatia. She was the eldest child of Croatian Ban, Petar Zrinski, and his wife Katarina Zrinska n√©e Frankopan, a Croatian poet. Later her parents had two daughters, Judita Petronila (1652-1699), and Aurora Veronika (1658-1735), as well as a son, Ivan Antun (1651-1703). Ilona and her siblings were the last generation of descendants of the once-powerful Zrinski family. From her childhood, she was known for her beauty and good education. There is little information on her schooling; it is known though that she acquired a high level of knowledge within her family, not only from her father and mother, Croatian writers and erudite persons but from her uncle Nikola VII Zrinski as well. =Marriages= On 1 March 1666, she married Francis R√°k√≥czi, with whom she had three children: Gy√∂rgy, born in 1667, who died in infancy; Julianna, born in 1672; and Ferenc (commonly known as Francis R√°k√≥czi II), born in 1676. On June 8, 1676, not long after Francis II's birth, the elder Francis died. The widowed Ilona requested guardianship of her children and was granted it, against the advice of Emperor Leopold I's advisers and against Francis I's will. In this way she also retained control over the vast R√°k√≥czi estates, which included among them the castles of Reg√©c, S√°rospatak, Makovica, and Munk√°cs. In 1682 she married Imre Th√∂k√∂ly and became an active partner in her second husband's Kuruc uprising against the Habsburgs. =Defense of Palanok Castle= After their defeat at the 1683 Battle of Vienna, both the Ottoman forces and Th√∂k√∂ly's allied Kuruc fighters had no choice but to retreat, and Th√∂k√∂ly quickly lost one R√°k√≥czi castle after another. At the end of 1685, the Imperial army surrounded the last remaining stronghold, Palanok Castle in Munk√°cs. Ilona Zr√≠nyi alone defended the castle for three years (1685‚Äì1688) against the forces of General Antonio Caraffa. =Internment, exile and death= After the recapture of Buda, the situation became untenable, and on 17 January 1688, Ilona had no choice but to surrender the castle, with the understanding that the defenders would receive amnesty from the Emperor, and that the R√°k√≥czi estates would remain in her children's name. Under this agreement, she and her children traveled immediately to Vienna, where in violation of the pact the children were taken from her. Ilona lived until 1691 in the convent of the Ursulines, where her daughter Julianna was also raised. Her son Francis was immediately taken to the Jesuit school in Neuhaus. At the time, her husband, Th√∂k√∂ly, was still fighting with his Kuruc rebels against the Habsburg army in Upper Hungary. When Habsburg General Heisler was captured by Th√∂k√∂ly, a prisoner exchange was arranged, and Ilona joined her husband in Transylvania. In 1699, however, after the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed, both spouses, having found themselves on the losing side, had to go into exile in the Ottoman Empire. The countess lived in Galata, district of Constantinople, and later in Izmit, where she died on 18 February 1703. She was buried in the French church of Saint Benoit in Galata. =Descendants= From her first marriage with Francis R√°k√≥czi, Ilona had three children: *Gy√∂rgy (1667‚Äì1667) *Julianna Borb√°la (September 1672 ‚Äì 1717) *Francis II (27 March 1676 ‚Äì 8 April 1735) From her second marriage with Imre Th√∂k√∂ly, Ilona had three children, all of whom died at a young age (including one she was pregnant with during the siege of Munk√°cs). Legacy Ilona Zr√≠nyi is celebrated in Croatia and Hungary as one of the greatest national heroines, patriots and fighters for freedom, who opposed, although unsuccessfully, the autocracy and absolutism aspirations of the Habsburgs. Her even more famous son Francis II R√°k√≥czi continued the struggle for the independence of Hungary (1703‚Äì1711). In October 1906 the remains of the Croatian countess were reinterred with her son's in the St Elisabeth Cathedral in present-day Ko≈°ice, Slovakia.

Parnell (born 13 August 1951, London, England) is an English rock drummer. Notable for his work in the band Atomic Rooster, he is probably best known for his role as the ill-fated drummer Mick Shrimpton in the film This is Spinal Tap. Career Parnell has a long family history of musical ambition. His grandfather Russ Carr was a music hall artist and his father Jack Parnell was a jazz drummer and bandleader. He has two brothers, Will and Marc Parnell, who are also drummers. His two sisters decided not to enter the music business. In 1970 he was a member of the short-lived hard rock band Horse, who recorded one album before breaking up.Joynson, Vernon (1995). The Tapestry of Delights . London: Borderline Books. Shortly after, he briefly joined the progressive rock band Atomic Rooster, leaving after just two months with the band. By the end of 1971 he had been invited to rejoin Atomic Rooster, this time staying long enough to play on the band's last two albums. After Atomic Rooster folded, Parnell (using his nickname \\"Spyder\\") joined with the Italian group Tritons, who had a hit in Italy with their re-arranged version of the Rolling Stones song \\"Satisfaction\\" in 1973. They quickly issued an album also titled Satisfaction that same year. Several members of Tritons were more interested in performing music of a more serious nature; these members (including Parnell) left Tritons and helped co-found the Italian prog- rock group Ibis. Parnell was the drummer and co-lyricist on their 1974 album, Sun Supreme. The group continued for one further album after Parnell left. In 1975, Parnell was a member of the more pop/rock oriented group Stars, which issued one self-titled album before breaking up. That was followed by a two- album stint as drummer for Italian/British jazz fusion group Nova in 1977 and 1978. After leaving Nova, Parnell continued to play for various other bands and artists throughout the 1970s and 1980s including Michael Des Barres and Lisa Dal Bello, as well as providing the drums for the Toni Basil hit \\"Mickey\\" among other contributions. At one time, Steve Perry offered him a spot in Journey, but Parnell declined as he was preoccupied with his studio band at the time Zoo Drive, a decision he later regretted. Parnell's big break came in 1984 when he played the role of Mick Shrimpton in the mockumentary This is Spinal Tap. His character was one of a long line of unfortunate drummers who all perish from freak accidents, his own fate being spontaneous combustion. > \\"The first question they asked was, 'What do you think about a movie that's > going to tear your career apart?' I said, 'You should have made this movie > about 10 years ago.' They then asked me what other bands I'd been in, and I > said, 'Well, I was in a band called Atomic Rooster.' They looked at each > other and said, 'Yep, that's it, you're our man.' \\" Spinal Tap became a working band, recording a soundtrack album and promoting the film with live shows and a 1984 appearance on Saturday Night Live. The character of Mick Shrimpton having died in This Is Spinal Tap, Parnell assumed the role of his \\"twin brother\\" drummer Ric Shrimpton for the group's appearances subsequent to the film. This continued through the band's 1992 reunion album Break Like the Wind and the associated concert tour. Parnell has not been a part of more recent Spinal Tap activity. Recently, Parnell was living in Missoula, Montana where he co-hosted an 8-midnight radio program (which is aptly titled \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\") on KDTR Trail 103.3 FM. Parnell is an avid golfer and frequently plays golf when he is not employed playing the drums.

It was founded in , and closed on June 30th 2020. It provided a cloud computing service, which used ten data centres; in the United Kingdom (two sites), Netherlands, United States (four sites), Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Company ElasticHosts was privately held and competed with other public cloud-infrastructure providers such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Rackspace Cloud. According to CEO Richard Davies, the company aimed to provide servers that were set up as similar as possible to how one would provision dedicated hosting, with the exception that the customer can self-serve at any time. ElasticHosts' EU hosting data centres are in the UK and not Ireland. It is the first public cloud service built on Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (rather than Xen), and it has an API that has been given a good review from a REST perspective. It charges for resources (CPU, memory, disk and network) as separate entities, allowing customers to build virtual machines with widely different characteristics instead of simply categorized ones, such as small, medium and large instances. ElasticHosts (and therefore licensees) are supported directly by BoxGrinder included in Fedora 15 as of May 2011. Services * Cloud Servers are virtualized on-demand servers, designed to behave like physical servers. Cloud Servers can be managed via their web control panel or API. * Containers * Managed Cloud Servers take care of the set up and management of servers. Management is offered by a partner company called Cloudways. * Cloud Websites provide redundant, scalable hosting for websites. This is offered by partner company Hybrid Sites. * Reseller and referrer programs offered by Elastichosts, include one called White-Label. The White-Label Reseller Program allows companies to rebrand Elastichosts cloud hosting platform and resell it. * Elasticstack is the underlying software to provide cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This is available as a licensed product, and several other companies around the world use the same infrastructure, licensed from ElasticHosts Ltd, to provide their own branded IaaS cloud to their customers. ElasticHosts Cloud Servers are available from ten data centres; San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Maidenhead (UK), Portsmouth (UK), Amsterdam, Toronto, Hong Kong and Sydney. = Storage = ElasticHosts only has persistent storage, based on local host store. However, in 2012 it announced solid-state drives (SSD) for all instance sizes. It does not use a storage area network, but instead has directly attached RAID arrays, with iSCSI interconnects between hosts. In 2011 the CEO predicted a greater demand for storage. =Elastic IP addresses= ElasticHosts has two types of IPv4 addresses - static and dynamic. Both are allocated from the same pools of addresses, but static addresses are kept by the account, and can be allocated to any account's server at any time. Dynamic ones are randomly allocated for any server that has not been specifically allocated a static IP address. These are not guaranteed to remain the same, though remain for the lifespan of the instance. A shutdown of the virtual machine may or may not reallocate the IP address. ElasticHosts does not lock a static IP to a server instance - they can be reallocated from the control panel. Reverse DNS is managed by the customer from the control panel. =Elastic Containers= Elastichosts announced on 14 April 2014 that in addition to maintaining their traditional cloud VM business, they were releasing an alternate type of server, based on linux running within containers. This implementation, similar to chroot or BSD jails uses the more advanced Linux kernel Control Groups feature, which the company deemed mature enough to use as the basis for a new type of cloud server, launched under the name \\"Elastic Containers\\". Claiming this as a world first in terms of virtualization, the company currently offers versions of Debian, Ubuntu and Centos - though because of the nature of the containers, all run with the host's Linux kernel. Containers in and of themselves are not a new technology, with the cgroups features first begun being added to the Linux kernel in 2007; and other companies such as Docker Inc. producing software that uses them to virtualize applications; this is claimed as the first time an IaaS provider has used the technology for full operating system use. Various press articles focused on the newly released pay as you go billing option, whereby the container can optionally be billed for actual usage, as opposed to some fixed instance size, in 15 minute increments; where the common industry standard is 1 hour time blocks for cloud server rentals. In particular the CEO's claim that customers could save up to 50% on traditional costs using the service. Some analysts expressed confidence that container based systems had to be the future for cloud providers; \\"Given the fiercely competitive nature of cloud pricing these days, it‚Äôs hard to see how containers won‚Äôt become a dominant mechanism for delivering cloud services.\\" though others wondered whether this would actually pull customers from the dominating players in the market - Owen Rogers, senior analyst for digital economics at 451 Research, noted that though the ‚Äúinteresting and unique‚Äù model did give Elastichosts an advantage, with the \\"... rest of the market ... still based on virtual machines, and I can¬πt see this changing overnight‚Äù; but wondered whether \\"... consumers really care about ElasticHosts‚Äô more detailed ‚Äì and arguably fairer ‚Äì method of pricing, when its bigger competitors are slashing prices\\" = Sale = ElasticHosts was acquired by Paragon Internet Group in April 2016. Paragon itself was acquired by Host Europe Group in late 2015. Host Europe Group was acquired by GoDaddy in December 2016, meaning that ElasticHosts was ultimately a subsidiary of GoDaddy prior to Godaddy's decision to close the brand effective June 30th 2020 (see reference 3).

From 1939 until 1943 he was head of an antisemitic propaganda publication service and news agency called Welt-Dienst / World-Service / Service Mondial. Life and work Schirmer attended a Gymnasium in Celle and studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule Hannover. After 1929, he worked as a foreman at the Prussian Hochbauamt in Torgau. From 1930 to 1933 he was a research assistant at the Hanover University in Hanover and from the winter semester 1935/36 on he served there as a political education lecturer. Political Activism In May 1929 he joined the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB) and in February 1930 the NSDAP at Hanover. From July 1933 he acted within the party as Gauschulungsleiter and Gaukulturwart in South Hanover Brunswick. In July 1934 he became a member of the Reichstag for the constituency of Schirmer 6 (Pomerania). For most of his career Schirmer was a functionary in the Amt Rosenberg (Rosenberg Bureau), a collection of offices under the direction of Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg. Beginning on 1 November 1935 he went to work in the Welt-Dienst organization, overseeing its American Section. When Rosenberg reorganized antisemitic propaganda operations in 1939, wresting full control of the Welt-Dienst / World-Service / Service Mondial news service from its founder Ulrich Fleischhauer, Schirmer became its head in July 1939. Shortly afterwards he announced the relocation of the offices to Frankfurt am Main, where all anti-Jewish 'research establishments' under Alfred Rosenberg's direction were concentrated. In addition, Schirmer continued to be involved in Nazi cultural plunder activities for the vast Amt Rosenberg operation once World War II began. Schirmer was Oberreichsleiter (general director) of the Netherlands Task Force (AG Niederlande; later HAG) from September 1940 until May 1941. Schirmer resigned from Welt-Dienst in August 1943, at which time it was published in 18 languages. His replacement as editor of World-Service in September 1943 occurred after Schirmer came under suspicion of fraud because he had allegedly taken a valuable postage stamp collection seized in Paris from Jewish owners for his own private purposes rather than those of the German state. Schirmer died 30 October 1948 in the St. Josef-Stift hospital in Celle and is buried there in the city cemetery.

Azzaro's current handicap is 6 goals, but he held the sport's highest handicap of 10 goals for over ten years.World Polo Tour Rankings: Mike Azzaro Azzaro was awarded Polo Magazine's Polo Excellence Award for Young Player of the Year in 1987 and 1990, and the award for Player of the Year in 1994.Polo Excellence Awards Retrieved April 29, 2018. Known for his aggressive forward style of play, he has always been a crowd favorite. Playing with five-time Player of the Year winner Memo Gracida, they formed one of the most powerful duos in polo. Azzaro and Gracida both reside in Wellington, Florida. Biography Azzaro was first awarded the highest handicap in 1994 after reaching the finals of every high goal tournament in the Palm Beach season as well as winning the U.S. Open in California. In 1995 he was lowered back to 9 after the 1994 season and U.S. Open in which teams he was on did not perform well. In 1996 after having a great season he was raised to 10 goals, a rating he held until the mid-2000s. In 2009, he was to captain the U.S. Team against Mexico in the Camacho Cup. However he had an injury that ended his Florida season. He bounced back in the summer by captaining the Luchese team to one of the three finals of the Santa Barbara season. Among his many accomplishments and recognitions is the standing ovation he received while playing the Palermo Open in Argentina with the La Mariana team (Sebastian Merlos, Pite Merlos, Milo Fernandez-Araujo) in 1995. While the team lost it further cemented Azzaro as a prominent figure in Polo. Teams he has played for include the Black Bears, Maple Leafs, Michelob, Tarahumara, Gehache (U.S. Open Winner), Outback (U.S. Open Winner), Isla Carroll (U.S. Open Winner), Pegasus, Templeton, Old Pueblo, Luchese, Evergaldes, Grants Farm Manor (U.S Open Winner), Hanalie Bay, Ellerstina, White Birch, Retama II (U.S. Open Winners), Les Liones, BTA, Red Legs, Zacara, Klentner Ranch. It had been confirmed that in 2012 Mike Azzaro would form part of the Crab Orchard Polo team. His role on the team will be that of the lynch pin third player on a team that includes Adolfo Cambiaso, David \\"Pelon\\" Stirling and team captain George Rawlings. In what ultimately disbanded the team and ended up terminating Cambiaso's relationship with Crab Orchard, Mike Azzaro was dropped from the team's lineup. Many believing Cambiaso was not interested in playing with Azzaro. That year saw Azzaro join the Zacara squad that ended up winning the US Open and him winning the MVP. The following year, in a final against Cambia's Valiente team, Mike Azzaro and Zacara (Lyndon Lea, Facundo Pieres and Magoo Laprida) once again won the US Open, further cementing Mike Azzaro's place in high goal polo. In 2011, despite a strong team and high expectations, the Crab Orchard squad of Cambiaso, Rawlings, Hilario Ulloa and South African Nachi du Plesis, failed to be the powerhouse everyone in the polo community expected. In March 2017 he participated at the Iglehart Cup where his team, La Indiana, won 11-4. On October 16, 2017, he was named most valuable player after winning the US Trust Cup at the Buenos Aires Field of the Sundayat Santa Rita Polo Farm and then a week later he was named MVP again for winning 9-8 at the United States Polo Association Fall Classic.

ARR calculates the return, generated from net income of the proposed capital investment. The ARR is a percentage return. Say, if ARR = 7%, then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested (yearly). If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return, the project is acceptable. If it is less than the desired rate, it should be rejected. When comparing investments, the higher the ARR, the more attractive the investment. More than half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects.Arnold, G. (2007). Essentials of corporate financial management. London: Pearson Education, Ltd. The key advantage of ARR is that it is easy to compute and understand. The main disadvantage of ARR is that it disregards the time factor in terms of time value of money or risks for long term investments. The ARR is built on evaluation of profits and it can be easily manipulated with changes in depreciation methods. The ARR can give misleading information when evaluating investments of different size. Basic formulas : \\\\text{ARR} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Average return during period}}{\\\\text{Average investment}} where: : \\\\text{Average investment} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life}}{\\\\text{2}} : \\\\mbox{Average return during period} = {\\\\mbox{Incremental revenue} -\\\\mbox{ Incremental expenses (including depreciation)}\\\\over \\\\mbox{Initial investment}} : \\\\mbox{Average profit} = {\\\\mbox{Profit after tax}\\\\over \\\\mbox{Life of investment}}  Pitfalls  # This technique is based on profits rather than cash flow. It ignores cash flow from investment. Therefore, it can be affected by non-cash items such as bad debts and depreciation when calculating profits. The change of methods for depreciation can be manipulated and lead to higher profits. # This technique does not adjust for the risk to long term forecasts. # ARR doesn't take into account the time value of money.

An erudite theologian and Hebraist, he is best remembered as the author of De Legibus Hebraeorum, a pioneer work of comparative religion, in which he advanced the thesis that Judaism was not the earliest of mankind's religions.Margaret T. Hodgen, Early Anthropology in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1971), p. 330. Life He was a native of Bocton, near Blean, Kent, where he was baptised on 31 October 1630. He was educated at the King's School, Canterbury, became king's scholar there, and was admitted to a scholarship of Archbishop Parker's foundation in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 25 March 1645. He graduated B.A. in 1648, M.A. in 1652, B.D. in 1659, and D.D. in 1665. He was chosen a fellow of his college about 1655. After taking holy orders he became a university preacher, served the cures first of St Giles and then of St Benedict, Cambridge, and on 23 July 1667 was instituted to the rectory of Landbeach, Cambridgeshire, which he resigned in 1683 in favour of his nephew and curate, William Spencer. On 3 August 1667 he was unanimously elected master of Corpus Christi College, a post he held for 26 years. He was appointed a prebendary in the first stall at Ely in February 1671‚Äì72, and served the office of vice-chancellor of the university in the academic year 1673-4, during which he delivered a speech addressed to the Duke of Monmouth on his installation as chancellor of the university. He was admitted, on the presentation of the king, to the archdeaconry of Sudbury in the church of Norwich on 5 September 1667; and was instituted to the deanery of Ely on 9 September 1677. He died on 27 May 1693, and was buried in the college chapel, where a monument with a Latin inscription was erected to his memory. He was a major benefactor to the college. Works In 1669 he published a Dissertatio de Urin. et Thummin (Cambridge, 8vo), in which he referred those mystic emblems to an Egyptian origin. (See Urim and Thummim.) The tract was republished in the following year, and afterwards, in 1744, by Blasius Ugolinus in Thesaurus Antiquitatum. He contributed verses to the Cambridge University Collection on the death of Henrietta Maria, queen dowager, 1669. In 1685 appeared Spencer's major work, his De Legibus Hebraeorum, Ritualibus et earum Rationibus libri tres (Cambridge, 1685; The Hague, 1686). In this work Spencer derived nearly all his data from classical writers of Greece and Rome, the Church Fathers, the works of Josephus, or from the Bible itself. Among his adverse critics were Hermann Witsius in his Aegyptiaca in 1683, Joannes Wigersma, Ibertus Fennema, Andreas Kempfer and Joannes Meyer, John Edwards (1637‚Äì1716), and John Woodward. Later writers hostile to Spencer's thesis were William Jones of Nayland, and Archbishop Magee, who rebuked William Warburton for defending Spencer against Witsius. Later works on comparative religion, such as Julius Wellhausen's History of Israel (1878) and Cornelis Petrus Tiele's Histoire Compar√©e des Anciennes Religions de l'Egypte et des Peuples S√©mitiques, developed the lines of thought in Spencer. A second edition of Spencer's work appeared at Cambridge in 1727, (revised by Leonard Chappelow), and another at T√ºbingen, 1732. Given the religious views at the time, it was indexed in The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature: K.Q (by William Thomas Lowndes, published by W. Pickering, 1834, see p. 1722) as \\"a very learned but dangerous work, the great object of which is to show that the Hebrew ritual was almost entirely borrowed from the Egyptians.\\" Spencer also wrote A Discourse concerning Prodigies, wherein the vanity of Presages by them is reprehended, and their true and proper Ends asserted and vindicated, London, 1663; 2nd edit., to which is added a short Treatise concerning Vulgar Prophecies, London, 1665. The former edition was read by Samuel Pepys, who called it \\"most ingeniously writ, both for matter and style.\\"Diary, 1 June 1664. Jan Assmann suggests that Spencer was influenced by Maimonides and that Karl Leonhard Reinhold took the same approach.Jan Assmann, \\"Moses as Go- Between: John Spencer's Theory of Religious Translation\\", in: Andreas H√∂fele, Werner von Koppenfels (eds.), Renaissance Go-betweens: cultural exchange in early modern Europe, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, . Family He married Hannah, daughter of Isaac Puller of Hertford, and sister of Timothy Puller. She died in 1674, having had one daughter (Elizabeth) and one son (John). In 1667, while Spencer was Master, his daughter was entertaining a young undergraduate when her father interrupted them. She hid the student in a wardrobe (which college records state only opened from the outside) where he was left for a long time and asphyxiated. Elizabeth, in a fit of grief, committed suicide.

The Catholic Church's response to the scandal can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at all three levels in parallel with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. Diocesan responses to the problem For the most part, responding to allegations of sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the bishop or archbishop. Many of the accused priests were forced to resign or were laicized. In addition, several bishops who had participated in the cover-up were also forced to resign or retire. It was revealed that some bishops had facilitated compensation payments to alleged victims on condition that the allegations remained secret. In addition, rather than being dismissed, the accused were often instructed to undergo psychological counseling and, on completion of counseling, reassigned to other parishes where, in some cases, they continued to abuse minors. The dioceses in which abuse was committed or in which abuse allegations were settled out of court found it necessary to make financial settlements with the victims totaling over $1.5 billion as of March 2006. The number and size of these settlements made it necessary for the dioceses to reduce their ordinary operating expenses by closing churches and schools. In many instances, dioceses were forced to declare bankruptcy as a result of the settlements. Response of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops Before The Boston Globes coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, handling of sexual abuse allegations was largely left up to the discretion of individual bishops. After the number of allegations exploded following the Globe's series of articles, U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. As the breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United States, the USCCB declared that a joint response was warranted at the episcopal conference level. John F. Allen Jr. characterized the reaction of the USCCB as calling for ‚Äúswift, sure and final punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct.‚Äù In contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican's primary concern as wanting to make sure ‚Äúthat everyone‚Äôs rights are respected, including the rights of accused clergy\\" and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to \\"remedy the injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or may not be guilty.‚Äù =Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People= In June 2002, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) unanimously approved a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People that pledged the Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a \\"safe environment\\" for all children in Church-sponsored activities. To accomplish this, the U.S. bishops made a commitment to develop uniform procedures for handling sex-abuse allegations against lay teachers in Catholic schools, parish staff members, coaches and other people who represent the Church to young people. The thrust of the charter was the adoption of a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy for sexual abuse. retrieved February 14, 2009 retrieved February 14, 2009 The USCCB instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees. They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. The Charter also created a National Review Board, which was assigned responsibility to commission a descriptive study on the nature and scope of the abuse problem. =Essential norms= At the June 2002 conference, to ensure that each diocese/eparchy in the United States had procedures in place to respond promptly to allegations of sexual abuse of minors, the Bishops also decreed Essential Norms for Diocesan/Eparchial Policies Dealing with Allegations of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Priest or Deacons. =Prevention efforts= In 2002, the U.S. church claimed to adopt a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy for sexual abuse. By 2008, the U.S. church had trained 5.8 million children to recognize and report abuse. It had run criminal checks on 1.53 million volunteers and employees, 162,700 educators, 51,000 clerics and 4,955 candidates for ordination. It had trained 1.8 million clergy, employees and volunteers in creating a safe environment for children. Response from the Holy See =Initial response= Although the Vatican did not respond immediately to the series of articles published by The Boston Globe in 2002, it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the situation in the U.S. closely. Over time, it became more apparent that the problem warranted greater Vatican involvement. On April 30, 2001, John Paul II, issued a letter stating that \\"a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or 'delictum gravius.'\\" =Crimen Sollicitationis controversy= In 2003 the existence of the \\"Crimen sollicitationis\\" secret document was revealed and some interpretations of the document concluded that it contains instructions to cover up abuse cases. =2003 Vatican Conference on Sexual Abuse= In April 2003, the Pontifical Academy for Life organized a three-day conference, entitled \\"Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious\\", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. =Papal apologies= In 2003, Pope John Paul II stated that \\"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\\".Walsh, John Paul II: A Light for the World (2003), p. 62 =New rules regarding ordination= Because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, the Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees and issued new rules disallowing ordination of men with \\"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\\". =The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors= The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors () was instituted by Pope Francis on 22 March 2014 for the safeguarding of minors.

According to Andrea Tornielli, these: Law No. CCXCVII requiries Vatican City officials, including those in the Roman Curia, and diplomatic personnel of the Holy See, such as the Apostolic Nuncios, to report sex abuse.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope- francis-sexual-abuse-new-laws-require-reporting-vatican-holy- see-29-03-2019/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/03/29/Pope- Francis-announces-new-law-to-protect-Vatican-City-children/6001553860208/ Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros (about $5,600) or, in the case of a Vatican gendarme, up to six months in prison.https://abc7chicago.com/religion/pope-demands-sex-abuse-claims-be- reported-in-vatican-city/5224228/ In addition, all crimes related to child abuse, including mistreatment, are persecutable ‚Äúex officio‚Äù, even when the purported victim does not file an official report. The law also extends the statute of limitations to 20-year prescription that, in the case of and offence against a minor, begin to count from on his or her eighteenth birthday. In addition, the Governorate of the Vatican City State is required to set up, within the Vatican Department of Health and Welfare, service to support and assist the victims of abuse, providing them with medical and psychological assistance and informing them of their rights and of how to enforce them. The motu proprio extends the application of the Vatican law to the Roman Curia and its personnel. It requires that, when recruiting staff, the candidate's suitability to interact with minors must be ascertained. The Guidelines for the Vicariate of Vatican City are addressed to the canons, parish priests and coadjutors of the two parishes located within the Vatican, as well as to the priests, deacons and educators of the Saint Pius X Pre- Seminary, to all the religious men and women who reside in the Vatican, and to all those who work within the ecclesiastical community of the Vicariate of Vatican City. The guidelines require that, in the course of pastoral activities, those persons must always be visible to others when they are in the presence of minors, and that it is strictly forbidden to establish a preferential relationship with a single minor, to address a minor in an offensive way or to engage in inappropriate or sexually allusive conduct, to ask a minor to keep a secret, to photograph or to film a minor without the written consent of his parents. The Vicar of Vatican City has also the obligation to report to the Promoter of Justice any news of abuse that is not manifestly unfounded, and to remove the alleged perpetrator of the abuse from pastoral activities as a precautionary measure. =The Motu Proprio Vos estis lux mundi= On May 9, 2019, Pope Francis issued the Motu Proprio Vos estis lux mundi requiring both clerics and religious brothers and sisters, including Bishops, throughout the world to report sex abuse cases and sex abuse cover-ups by their superiors. Under the new Motu Proprio, all Catholic dioceses throughout the world are required to establish stable mechanisms or systems through which people may submit reports of abuse or its cover-up by June 2020. All metropolitan Archdioceses are also required to send reports to the Holy See on the progress of the investigation, whether in their Archdiocese or suffragan dioceses, every 30 days and to complete the investigation within 90 days unless granted an extension. The law is effective for a 3-year experimental period with a vacatio legis of 1 June 2019. According to Canon law professor Kurt Martens: = The Rescript \\"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\\" = On December 17, 2019 Pope Francis issued canon law instruction \\"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\\" lifting the \\"pontifical secret\\" in the cases relating to: violence or abuse of authority in forcing sexual acts, sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable persons, crimes of paedophilia involving children under 18 years of age or with incapacitated subjects and the concealment of those conducts from ecclesiastical or civil inquiries.https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2019/12/17/1011/02062.html Under this provisions, are excluded from the pontifical secret all the stages of the canonical trials, from the denunciation, to the phase of the preliminary investigations, to the phase of the proper debate, and up to the final decision, as well as any witness statements and documents produced in trial. It concerns both the procedures that take place at the local level, and those that take place in Rome, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2019/12/17/191217f.html The instruction provides however that the information obtain in a canonical trial be treated in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and confidentiality with a view to protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved. Moreover, the Instruction does not in any way counter the absolute duty of the Priest to observe the sacramental seal nor the duty of observe the confidentiality of information acquired outside of confession within the whole forum called \\"extra-sacramental\\". At the same time, the professional secrecy of those involved in a canonical trial should not constitute an obstacle to ‚Äúthe fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by the laws of the State, including any reporting obligations [of possible news of a crime], and the execution of the enforcement requests of the civil courts‚Äù which, naturally, could oblige the delivery of documentary material to the civil courts. According to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that: Criticism of bishops for parish transfers Some bishops have been heavily criticized for moving offending priests from parish to parish, where they still had personal contact with children, rather than seeking to have them permanently removed from the priesthood by laicization. The Church was widely criticized when it was discovered that some bishops knew about some of the alleged crimes committed, but reassigned the accused instead of seeking to have them permanently removed from the priesthood.Bruni, A Gospel of Shame (2002), p. 336Steinfels, A People Adrift (2003). pp. 40-6 Resignations, retirements and laicizations Many of the accused priests were forced to resign or were laicized. In addition, several bishops who had participated in the cover up were also forced to resign or retire. Bernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston, Massachusetts, United States resigned after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese. December 13, 2002 Pope John Paul II accepted Law's resignation as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the Roman Curia naming him archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Law presided at one of the Pope's funeral masses. Law's successor, Bishop S√©an P. O'Malley a Capuchin friar found it necessary to sell substantial real estate properties and close a number of churches in order to pay the $120 million in claims against the archdiocese. Two bishops of Palm Beach, Florida, resigned due to child abuse allegations, resigned bishop Joseph Keith Symons was replaced by Anthony O'Connell, who later also resigned in 2002.

Falcon was the son of Michael Falcon of Hotstead House, Norwich and his wife Isabella (n√©e Mordy) from Workington in Cumberland. He was educated at Harrow School and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. and LL.B. in 1910, and was called to the bar in 1911 at the Inner Temple. During World War I he was a captain in the Territorial Force from 1915 to 1918. He was elected at the 1918 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Norfolk, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1923 general election. He was mainly associated with Cambridge University Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), of which he was a member. He played Minor Counties cricket with Norfolk County Cricket Club from 1906 to 1946, and captained the team from 1912 to 1946.Wisden 1977, p. 1040. He made 89 appearances in first-class matches, but never played in the County Championship CricketArchive. Retrieved on 8 August 2009. In 1921 AC MacLaren said Falcon was the best fast bowler in England and regretted that he was not selected for the Ashes that summer. He played in MacLaren's England XI in August 1921 which beat the previously undefeated Australians at Eastbourne, distinguishing himself by taking 6/67 in Australia's first innings.  Personal life  Falcon was married in 1930 to Kathleen Gascoigne, the daughter of Captain G. C. O. Gascoigne. They had five children, Mary, Sybil, Anne, Michael and Rachel. His brother, Harry, was also a first-class cricketer.

Extent of media coverage According to a study conducted jointly by the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, both of which belong to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C.: * In 2002, when a Boston Globe series began a critical mass of news reports, the coverage mostly emanated from the United States. In 2010, however, much of the reporting focused on child abuse in Europe, with English- language European newspapers publishing three times as many articles on the scandal as U.S. papers. * The sheer amount of coverage this year came close but fell slightly short of 2002. (\\"A Nexis keyword search of 90 media outlets found 1,559 stories mentioning the scandal in the first four months of 2010, just 77 fewer articles than in a similar four-month period in mid-2002.)\\" * From mid-March (when the pope's role in a decades-old abuse case in Germany came under scrutiny) through late April, clergy sexual abuse was the eighth biggest story in the mainstream media, beating out coverage of nuclear weapons policy and the Tea Party movement. * The scandal found little traction in new media, however. Across the millions of blogs and Twitter posts tracked in PEJ's weekly monitoring, the clergy abuse scandal registered as a leading topic in only one of the six weeks analyzed. * Pope Benedict XVI was by far the biggest news maker, featured in 51.6% of the stories about the scandal in the mainstream U.S. media (including print, radio, network television, cable TV and online news sources) during the six-week period from March 12 through April 27. * All other individual figures combined, including cardinals, bishops and priests, appeared as lead newsmakers in just 12% of the stories. * An examination of three Catholic news outlets reveals wide differences in their approaches. The National Catholic Reporter, an independent weekly, devoted fully two-thirds (66.7%) of its Vatican coverage to the scandal. Two Catholic news services, on the other hand, devoted considerably less of their Vatican coverage to the story. Catholic News Service gave it 44.8%, and the Catholic News Agency gave it 33.3%. * Among the religion blogs published by high-circulation U.S. newspapers, those operated by USA Today and The Washington Post contained the most entries on the clergy abuse scandal - a total of 12 each during the six weeks studied. =Boston Globe coverage= However, it was not until early 2002 that the Boston Globe coverage of a series of criminal prosecutions of five Roman Catholic priests thrust the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight on an ongoing basis. retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 retrieved March 21, 2009 The coverage of these cases encouraged other victims to come forward with their allegations of abuse resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.Bruni, A Gospel of Shame (2002), p. 336 In a May 2002 interview with the Italian Catholic publication, 30 Giorni, Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga claimed that Jews influenced the Boston Globe to exploit the recent controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.ADL Outraged by Honduran Cardinal's Jewish Conspiracy Theory This provoked outrage from the Anti-Defamation League, especially since Maradiaga had a reputation as a moderate and was regarded as a papabile. Before the Boston Globe coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, handling of sexual abuse allegations was largely left up to the discretion of individual bishops. After the number of allegations exploded following the Globe's series of articles, U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. In addition to matters regarding priests, the Boston Globe also reported in 2002 on matters with church staff, including a pastoral care and CCD worker, Paul Merullo, and a teenager, in Woburn, Massachusetts, which had occurred in 2000 but only made public in 2001. Merullo was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.Carroll, Matt, \\"Church worker is sentenced\\", Boston Globe, March 12, 2002 In 2003, the series of articles in the Boston Globe received a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The Globe was honored, according to the Pulitzer website, \\"for its courageous, comprehensive coverage ... an effort that pierced secrecy, stirred local, national and international reaction and produced changes in the Roman Catholic Church.\\" Criticisms of media coverage = United States = On March 24, 2010, a report by The New York Times cited the Fr. Murphy case to accuse Pope Benedict XVI of a cover-up while he was head of the CDF in 1996. However, Father Thomas Brundage, judicial vicar who presided at the Church's internal discipline trial of the case stated that even though his name and comments had been liberally and often inaccurately quoted in The New York Times and more than 100 other newspapers and on-line periodicals, he had never once been contacted by any news organization for comment. He added that \\"Pope Benedict XVI has done more than any other pope or bishop in history to rid the Catholic Church of the scourge of child sexual abuse and provide for those who have been injured...on the day that Father Murphy died, he was still the defendant in a church criminal trial.\\" It was also claimed that The New York Times article used an incorrect translation of the document on which it based its claims. Paolo Rodari of the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, wrote: \\"The computer- generated English version would support the NYT's allegations against Bertone and Ratzinger, but that same conclusion is not possible if a correct review of the sources is done.\\" He added that in the official Italian text written by the CDF, it is explained that either Fr. Murphy gives ‚Äòclear signs of repentance‚Äô or the canonical process will go to the end, including his dismissal from the clerical state. But in the English version used by the NYT, not only were some passages omitted, but frequently the contrary was said. Director of Apologetics and Evangelization for Catholic Answers, Jimmy Akin, also pointed out, \\"Back in 1996 the CDF did not have a mandate to handle cases of sexual abuse by priests... The reason that Weakland notified the CDF was not because the abuse of minors was involved but because the abuse of the sacrament of confession was involved.\\" In April 2010, there were reports of a letter signed by Cardinal Ratzinger in 1985, in which he allegedly dismissed a request to laicize a Father Stephen Kiesle, a California priest accused of molesting boys. The Vatican responded that \\"...the letter followed a request from the priest himself for laicization, supported by the bishop. As such it was not a punishment, or part of a canonical process or the civil trial. At this stage, Father Kiesle was already dismissed from pastoral duties during the investigation, and he had no contact with any parishioners or children.\\" The Pope's involvement with the 1985 letter has been covered in a two-part feature by the BBC. The Australian transport planning academic Paul Mees wrote, \\"Why did Ratzinger need to consider the request, Dawkins asks? And why didn‚Äôt he report Kiesle to the police? The answer is that Kiesle had already been reported to the police, convicted and sentenced. After completing his sentence, Kiesle left the priesthood and wrote to the CDF asking to be formally defrocked. Every year, some of the church's 410,000 priests quit.\\" Law professor John Coverdale, in a letter to The New York Times, wrote, \\"The [Laurie Goodstein] story is so wrong that it is hard to believe it is not animated by the anti-Catholic animus that the New York Times and other media outlets deny harboring... My complaint here is not that the article misuses the word \\"defrock\\" but rather that by so doing it strongly suggests to readers that Cardinal Ratzinger delayed the priest's removal from the ministry. Delaying laicization had nothing to do with allowing him to continue exercising the ministry, from which he had already been suspended. Not only does the article fail to make these distinctions, it positively misstate the facts. Its title is \\"Pope Put off Move to Punish Abusive Priest.\\"\\" = United Kingdom = A documentary entitled Sex Crimes and the Vatican, produced by a victim of clerical sex abuse for the BBC in 2006, included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that \\"a secret church decree called Crimen sollicitationis ... imposes the strictest oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation, and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the Catholic Church - excommunication.\\" However, John L. Allen, Jr. noted that three points had been established about Crimen sollicitationis since the airing of Worcester Telegram and Gazette in July 2003: * The document was exceedingly obscure. Most canon lawyers and bishops had never heard of it prior to the controversy in 2003, so to suggest it played a crucial role in shaping the church's response to the crisis is an exaggeration. *As an \\"instruction\\", the document's legal force expired in 1983 with the revision of the Code of Canon Law. Canon 1395,¬ß2 explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime \\"to be punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state if the case so warrants\\". * The document, written explicitly for solicitation in relation to confession, was concerned only with secrecy in internal ecclesiastical procedures. There was nothing in it, nor anywhere else in church law, that would have prevented a bishop (or anyone else) from reporting a crime of sexual abuse to the local police or a prosecuting attorney. Canon lawyers also told National Catholic Reporter that the high degree of secrecy in Crimen Sollicitationis was related to the fact that it dealt with the confessional. Secrecy in canonical cases serves three purposes: # It is designed to allow witnesses and other parties to speak freely, knowing that their responses will be confidential. # It allows the accused party to protect his good name until guilt is established. # It allows victims to come forward without exposing themselves to publicity. Coverage in literature and films =Books= A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns including Andrew Madden in Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse, Carolyn Lehman's Strong at the Heart: How it feels to heal from sexual abuse and the bestselling Kathy's Story by Kathy O'Beirne, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland. Ed West of The Daily Telegraph claimed Kathy Beirne's story was \\"largely invented\\", according to a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry-born Irish Daily Mail journalist and former editor of The Irish Catholic.\\"Mis lit: Is this the end for the misery memoir?\\", Daily Telegraph, 5 March 2008.

One of the CMC's primary functions is to authorize defense and munitions spending and product orders, and to determine how natural resources and products from military-controlled production units are earmarked and distributed domestically and for sale abroad. According to the WPK Charter, the CMC directs WPK activities in the KPA and is chaired by the WPK Chairman. The CMC relies on a number of organizations to carry out its mandate, including the KPA General Political Department, the WPK Military Department, and the WPK Machine-Building Department. The CMC also uses the WPK Military Affairs Department to transmit guidance and indoctrination of North Korea's reserve military training units. History The Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea was established at the 5th plenary meeting of the 4th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held on 10‚Äì14 December 1962. During its establishment, it was a committee subordinate to the WPK Central Committee under the full name Military Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. The committee was organized to its present form at the 6th plenary meeting of the 6th WPK Central Committee held on 29‚Äì31 August 1982. An amendment to the WPK charter in 1982 is believed to have made the CMC equal to the Central Committee, enabling it (among other things) to elect the WPK leader. The last public listing of the CMC was at the 21st Plenary Session of the 6th Central Committee in December 1993. By the 3rd Conference, seven of its nineteen 1993 members remained; the other twelve had either died, retired or were purged. The CMC was revitalized at the 3rd Conference, with Kim Jong- un and Ri Yong-ho elected as deputy chairmen. Except for his Central Committee membership, this was Kim Jong-un's only title at this time; in many ways, the CMC enabled him to develop a patronage network. New members included Vice Marshal Kim Yong-chun (Minister of People's Armed Forces), General Kim Myong- ruk (Chief of the Operation Bureau of the General Staff), General Yi Pyong- chol (Commander of the Korean People's Air Force), Admiral Jong Myong-do (Commander of the Korean People's Navy), Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol, Colonel General Choe Kyong-song (heads of the KPA's special forces) General Choe Pu-il and Colonel General Choe Sang-ryo (members of the General Staff). Civilians, such as Jang Song-thaek (head of the Administrative Department), also had seats on the commission. At the 4th Conference, Choe Ryong-hae was appointed CMC deputy chairman; Vice Marshal Hyon Chol-hae, General Ri Myong-su and Kim Rak-gyom were elected to the commission.  Organization  The Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea is headed by the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea as its chairman, and includes a number of members. The 3rd WPK Conference in September 2010 created the position of vice chairman. It was later abolished by at the 7th WPK Congress in May 2016.

Henderson stated in an interview that a young lad motivated him to play. He said that his name is Lewis. While Robbie wasn't the best football player he took inspiration from Lewis. Lewis was the best young football player he as ever seen. Henderson started his career on the books of Leeds United, before making his way to Scotland to sign for Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock. He never made an appearance for the Killie first team, partly due to a fractured eye socket at the hands of one of his team-mates, but was sent out on loan to Raith Rovers,and Queen of the South where he managed a few appearances at each club. When he was released by Kilmarnock, he signed for Greenock Morton in the Scottish Football League Second Division as part of Peter Cormack and Dave McPherson's quickly put together side that were relegated to the bottom division. However, under John McCormack, Henderson won a championship medal for the third division. After around 18 months at Morton, Henderson moved on to Stenhousemuir before leaving the senior game in 2007 to sign for Junior side Pollok after a deal with Berwick Rangers fell through after one appearance, then on to Bo'ness United until he was transfer listed in July 2008.

Specifically, the royal psalms deal with the spiritual role of kings in the worship of Yahweh. Aside from that single qualification, there is nothing else which specifically links the ten psalms. Each of the psalms make explicit references to their subject, the king. However, it has been posited that other psalms, which do not mention the king directly, may have been written for royalty (e.g. Psalm 22). Brevard Childs has raised the possibility that the royal psalms are strategically scattered throughout the psalter. According to Childs, these psalms are often paired with other psalms that give the royal psalms an eschatological and messianic sense.

It is thought to be involved in the antiaddictive effects of ibogaine-containing plant extracts, such as Tabernanthe iboga. Pharmacology Noribogaine is a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but does not affect the reuptake of dopamine. Unlike ibogaine, noribogaine does not bind to the sigma-2 receptor. Similarly to ibogaine, noribogaine acts as a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and binds to opioid receptors. It has greater affinity for each of the opioid receptors than does ibogaine. Noribogaine is a hERG inhibitor and appears at least as potent as ibogaine. The inhibition of the hERG potassium channel delays the repolarization of cardiac action potentials, resulting in QT interval prolongation and, subsequently, in arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. =Œ∫-Opioid receptor= Recently, noribogaine has been determined to act as a biased agonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR). It activates the G protein (GDP-GTP exchange) signaling pathway with 75% the efficacy of dynorphin A (EC50 = 9 ŒºM), but it is only 12% as efficacious at activating the Œ≤-arrestin pathway. Moreover, due to its very low efficacy on the Œ≤-arrestin pathway, noribogaine blocked dynorphin A activation of the pathway (IC50 = 1 ŒºM) and hence functioned as an antagonist of it. The Œ≤-arrestin pathway is thought to be responsible for the dysphoric and aversive effects of KOR activation, and its lack of activation by noribogaine may be the reason for the lack of dysphoric effects of the drug. This biased agonist/antagonist action of noribogaine at the KOR is unique to it relative to other iboga alkaloids and related compounds such as ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC). Moreover, it has been hypothesized that it may give noribogaine unique properties such that it may have the analgesic and antiaddictive effects of KOR agonists without the anxiogenic, dysphoric, or anhedonic effects that are typical of them.

They are in the subfamily Tydeinae of the family Tydeidae. Commonly found on the foliage of citrus trees around the world, Lorryia formosa also associates with a variety of other plant types. The life cycle includes six discrete stages of development, and the lifespan averages about 37 days. The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male, a process called thelytoky. Taxonomy Lorryia formosa, originally found in Morocco, was first described by Cooreman in 1958. In his 1980 revision of the family Tydeidae, H.M. Andr√© synonymized the genus Lorryia with Tydeus, and Lorryia formosa became Tydeus formosus. Andr√© based his revision on the similarities of the chaetotaxy, especially on the legs, but ignored body ornamentation, which is a major character used by other authors. In 1998, Kazmierski revised the Tydeinae subfamily, this time using ornamentation and other features, and reestablished the genus Lorryia. Description In Lorryia formosa, like all Acariformes mites, the capitulum is the head segment and the idiosoma is the body segment. The idiosoma is further subdivided into the propodosoma, metapodosoma, and opisthosoma. The Tydeinae subfamily, to which Lorryia formosa belongs, is characterized by having three pairs of lyrifissures (grooves that encircle the surface of an appendage) and a pair of primitive eyes (oculi) which commonly occur laterally on the propodosoma, the middle body segment to which the first two pairs of legs are attached. The genital region includes a progenital aperture flanked by setae. Specimens are generally less than 250 ¬µm long. Life cycle Scanning electron micrography of L. formosa, front view of the capitulum Life cycles of Lorryia formosa are characterized by six distinct developmental stages: egg, larva, nymph stages (protonymph, deutonymph, and tritonymph), and adult. The average lifetime is 37 days, of which 60% is considered adulthood. The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male; this type of parthenogenesis, where females are produced from unfertilized eggs, is called thelytoky. It is not known whether the intracellular endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia is responsible for the alteration in reproductive capability. Wolbachia, a genus of inherited bacteria common in insects, are known to alter the sex ratio in arthropods and mites. The sex ratio is also greatly influenced by the host plant: one study found that on citrus, 30% of the population were males, compared to 62% males when reared on grapefruit. Reared on rubber trees, the percentage of males in the population drops to very low, or nothing. Habitat and distribution Lorryia formosa has been found associated with chayote squash (Sechium edule), citrus, dahlia, pear, papaya, mango, Cola acuminata, and the parana pine (Araucaria angustifolia) in Brazil. In Portugal, it has been collected from Prunus domestica, P. persica, P. armeniaca, apple (Malus domestica), bell peppers (Capsicum annuum). It has also been reported from Hibiscus species collected in Guadeloupe, French Antilles. L. formosa is also found on citrus plants throughout the world. For example, it has been found in the Mediterranean region, as well as Algeria, Italy, Libya, Morocco, Portugal and Spain. It is common and widespread on Florida citrus. Lorryia formosa is the only species of Tydeinae thought to be a pest of citrus.

Glenelg unfortunately lost the 1990 SANFL Grand Final to Port Adelaide by 15 points. Adelaide signed him up as their oldest recruit for their inaugural AFL season in 1991 and he was one of their best performers in the midfield, averaging 24 disposals a game from his 15 appearances. He had a particularly strong debut in the club's inaugural game against Hawthorn at Football Park, with two goals and 29 disposals to earn two Brownlow votes as the Crows thumped the eventual season's premiers by 86 points.

It has two sequels: Soldier of Arete (1989) and Soldier of Sidon (2006). Soldier of the Mist and Soldier of Arete have been collected as Latro in the Mist.  Setting  Soldier of the Mist and the sequel Soldier of Arete by Gene Wolfe follow the adventures of a foreign mercenary named Latro through Ancient Greece in 479 B.C. As the result of a head injury, he suffers from both retrograde (the inability to recall past memories) and anterograde (the inability to create new memories) amnesia. He comes from the north, yet has no memory of events prior to the beginning of the novel. The narrative follows his struggle to find his home and his friends. Latro writes down the events he experiences, along with references to the various people, demigods and gods he encounter along the way, onto a scroll every day (or so we assume, however there sometimes appear to be temporal gaps in the narrative). He writes in his native tongue, a language no one he encounters seems to understand. Latro's ability to ‚Äúsee and talk with the gods and their companions‚Äù and to ‚Äúpenetrate at will the veil of the supernatural‚Äù is the compensation for his amnesia. He has in fact been cursed with this amnesia by the Great Mother (being both Demeter and Gaia), for an unknown insult, which is revealed later. Throughout the narrative, it becomes clear that the Great Mother and the Triple Goddess (Artemis / Hekate / Selene) are fighting, and both hope to use Latro as a pawn. Full Synopsis = Part I = Latro is given the scroll by a healer who hopes that it will help him combat his daily memory loss. Within the first few pages, Latro writes all that he knows, he has been injured fighting for the Great King (Xerxes I of Persia), in the Battle of Clay (Plataea), in which the Great King's army was defeated by Thought (Athens) and Rope (Sparta). He soon loses the people who were taking care of him and ends up in the company of the black man (who it is much later revealed is called Seven Lions) by a river where he sees his first god, a River God (Asopus). He offers his sword, Falcata, in sacrifice but the river-man returns her re-tempered with new strength. Latro is taken to a temple of the Shining God (Apollo) in Hill (Thebes), where the priests argue about a prophecy carved in the walls which makes reference to Latro. While the priests listen to the prophetess, Apollo appears to Latro. Apollo cannot cure Latro but tells him that he must go to a shrine of the Earth Mother (Demeter). She took his memory in punishment for some offense, which Latro has forgotten, and he must beg forgiveness. Only when Latro has been forgiven can he be cured, and only when he is furthest from his home may he find it again. The slave girl from the temple, named Io, claims that the prophetess told her to be Latro's slave, and to accompany him everywhere, yet it later turns out that she ran away of her own accord. Latro gained another companion, Pindaros, who is a poet who was designated by the priests of Hill (Thebes) to take Latro to the shrine of the Earth Goddess. They are all caught up in the revels of the Kid (Dionysus), also known as the God in the Tree and the King from Nysa. Latro wakes up beside a woman, and he covers her before going to wash in the river, and he sees a woman on the opposite bank bathed in moonlight (we later find out this was Artemis). The woman he slept with was named Hilaeria, who asks to accompany them on their pilgrimage. Latro, along with Io, the black man, Pindaros and Hilaeria are taken captive by the Rope Makers (Spartans). Latro discovers that if he touches a god, people can then see the god. He nudges a sleeping man who turns out to be the King of Nysa (Silenus, as opposed to Dionysus, who is the King from Nysa). Silenus asks Latro to sing to his accompaniment on the flute, and in doing so, Latro fulfills part of the prophecy from Hill (Thebes). Latro sees a snake-woman, who seems to be invisible to all others, she asks him to give her a human. One of the Rope Makers‚Äô slaves asks Latro to help them seek aid from the Great Mother (Demeter) in a planned uprising. Latro believes that it would be unsafe to refuse. = Part II = Latro wakes in Tower Hill (Corinth) to find himself slave to a merchant from Thought (Athens), Hypereides, who owned three ships and had fought in the Battle of Peace (Salamis). Although a prisoner, Latro travels untied in Hypereides‚Äô largest ship, the Europa, as is the black man, although their friends, Pindaros, Hilaeria and Io are tied as they are from Cowland (Boeotia, ruled by Thebes). Latro meets a man named Oior, who is one of the People of Scoloti. They agree to meet later in the evening. Meanwhile, Latro is approached by a woman with a snake skin wrapped around her waist, implying the despite the changes she is the same snake woman as before. She asks to be given Io as she does not eat normal food, she seems to be some form of vampire. She claims to be a servant of the Dark Goddess (Hecate). Oior tells Latro the story of his people. He claims that one of the oarsmen on Hyperides‚Äô ship is a cannibal sorcerer who means them harm. Latro agrees to help Oior kill the sorcerer, but someone tries to kill him first. Oior saves him and they swear to be blood brothers. Looking back, Latro sees Oior's face change to that of a ‚Äúscholar of the worst kind‚Äù (p. 84), one who is corrupt. A body washes up on shore, and is cremated. Latro meets a tall luminous figure (Hades), who raises the dead man from the burned out funeral pyre, and is accompanied by a dead bowman. This bowman killed the other dead man. Hades tells Latro that his wife (Persephone) would soon be sent to speak with Latro on behalf of her mother (Demeter). Latro then meets Europa, who was depicted on the figurehead and sails of Hyperides‚Äô ship. Because he admired her, she promises to speak to the Great Mother on his behalf. They put in at Peace to pick up some passengers or refugees to take them back to Thought (Athens), among whom are Kalleos, a madame, and her courtesans. Kalleos buys Latro from Hyperides to help rebuild her house and to serve as a bouncer. Kalleos throws a party for Pindaros, Hyperides and Eurykles of Miletos, a necromancer, as well as a couple others. After games and drinking, Eurykles claims he can raise spirits from their graves. The men take a bet on it and venture to a burial ground close by with Latro as a guard. It was a trick set up by Kalleos and Eurykles. However they find a grave which has been dug up and the coffin smashed open, which scares away the girl Kalleos sent with them. Eurykles performs a ritual over the corpse, but to his surprise Latro touches the corpse and it does in fact comes to life. Along with Pindaros, Io and Hilaeria, Latro visits the Hall of the Great Mother in Advent (a small city near Athens). Hilaeria hopes to be initiated to the mysteries of the Grain Goddess (another aspect of Great Mother). Latro buys a bull to sacrifice. After the sacrifice, the priest notices that the statue of the goddess has moved, he tells Latro to spend the night in the temple. = Part III = The cooks talk about some Rope Makers (Spartans) they've heard of, who are making the rounds of the houses of Thought asking what people had for breakfast the previous day, clearly looking for a man with daily memory loss. While Latro sweeps Kalleos‚Äô house, a woman surprises him and takes him to bed. She tells him that he will remember her as she is ‚Äúfar lovelier than Kore, the Maiden‚Äù. She is Aphrodite, and she tells him the story of Myrrah, mother of Adonis, and of how Kore (Persephone) stole Adonis from her. She leaves Latro confused, and Kalleos takes him to bed with her. Rope Makers (Spartans) led by a man named Eutakos, knock at the door and ask Latro who sold him. When they find he doesn't know they ask if he has a book and Io shows it to them. Eurykles appears offering a tip about Latro, hoping to get rewarded, but as the Rope Makers had already found Latro they refuse to tip him, and instead take him prisoner. The Rope Makers leave Thought (Athens), taking Latro, Io and Eurykles with them. Basias, a soldier is assigned as their guard. Latro leaves the campfire to talk to a woman he saw who introduces herself as Enodia, the Dark Mother (Hecate), also variously known as the Triple Goddess, Auge, the Huntress and Queen of the Neurians. She gives him a small snake and tells him to place it in a cup of wine, and give the cup to the man who has dedicated himself to her. Latro meets Eurykles (although he does not remember him and refers to him as the Milesian), and find out that he has been dedicated to the Triple Goddess since he was a child. Latro gives him the cup of wine with the snake. The Rope Makers (Spartans) stop off in a village, where Eurykles wants a drink. Latro goes along and agrees to a wrestling match with Basias. A big man with a club (Hercules) appears while he's wrestling and gives him a couple tips, although he ultimately tells Latro to let Basias win. Latro has a flash-back to the Battle of Clay (Plataea). He wakes up to a wet cloth on his forehead. A tall, ugly woman introduces herself as Eurykles. Io tells Latro that Eurykles is actually a man who wears a purple cloak. Eurykles writes a chapter, as Eutakos thinks that writing in the scroll is disordering Latro's mind. Euryklyes writes a bit about himself. Eurykles relates a dream Latro has about the god Aesculapius. Eurykles says that they are camped in Megara and that the following day they will be handed to the regent, Prince Pausanias, uncle of one of Sparta's two kings, King Pleistarchos. A runner, Pasicrates, arrives with a message from the regent. Pasicrates turns out to be the regent's protege. A tall woman in a purple cloak returns Latro his scroll, this woman is Eurykles, but now talks Latro about changing her name. They reach the Rope Makers‚Äô encampment and are brought to the regent, Pausanias. Pausanias had dreamed of Latro, Kore (Persephone) and Nike. Pausanias accuses Eurykles of being a spy. She gets angry, and bites Basias, his hand immediately begins to swell and go grey. News arrives of a combined victory for Thought and Rope at the Battle of Mycale. A healer claims Basias was bitten by a viper. Latro and Io find out that they are headed to Rope and the to Acheron to consult the dead. Latro asks Eurykles why people call her by a man's name, and she avoids the question by deciding to change her name to Drakaina. In a village in the SIlent Country (Laconia) Latro encounters Cerdon again. Cerdon reminds Latro of his promise to help the slave uprising. Drakaina takes Latro to bed, and like the snake- woman from Part I, Drakaina has a snake skin tied around her waist. She claims a memory of sitting with Latro on a hillside. Cerdon comes to fetch Latro but is bitten by a viper, and so Latro goes on alone. On his way he sees a lion and hears the singing of children. He sees a young girl sacrificed although he tried to save her. He does not release the Great Mother (Demeter) despite his promise, and suddenly the Rope Makers are there with Drakaina. The slaves disappear into the trees, regroup and attack the Rope Makers (Spartans). The blood from the battle revives the goddess, and she confronts Latro flanked by her lion and wolf. Latro touches her to make her visible and she asks one of her worshippers to sacrifice his privates to her in return for her aid to Pausanias. Once in Rope, Latro, Io and Drakaina visit a temple dedicated to the Huntress (under the name of Orthia), where they meet Gorgo, a priestess who is mother to the king and cousin/aunt to the regent. Latro tells them that the Huntress is displeased with Drakaina, as her statue is glaring at her. Pasicrates shows them how they've imprisoned the Great King's (Xerxes I) messengers in a semi-dried well. Drakaina claims that Pausanias gave her presents and that her transformation from man to woman was the Huntress fulfilling her desire. = Part IV = Near the river Acheron (the river of woe), Pausanias makes a sacrifice. The spirit of King Cleomenes appears and speaks a prophecy via Drakaina's mouth advising peace with Thought, by sending them aid in their siege of Sestos. Pasicrates is to lead the force, and Latro, Io and Drakaina offer to go too. They hope that Latro's presence will end the siege. A ghost in the shape of the man Eurykles had walked in the wake of King Cleomenes. Latro is invited to meet Pausanias‚Äô mantis, Tisamenus of Elis. Latro later hears Tisamenus‚Äô voice whispering to kill the man with the wooden foot. In Tower Hill (Corinth), they have to wait for their ship to be allowed through the isthmus. To make a little money, Drakaina reveals to the city strategist, Corustas, that their ship, Nausicaa, is headed to Sestos. While sailing, Latro asks who killed Basias (having read of him in the scroll) and Drakaina admits it was her. Latro falls overboard during a friendly wrestling match against Pasicrates, and meets Thoe, daughter of Nereus. She tries to seduce him and drown him, but he escapes and swims to shore. The shore is that of the Hot Gates (Thermopylae), where Pasicrates planned to sacrifice. As he cuts the bull's neck, Latro appears. Latro completes the sacrifice. Latro walks with Pasicrates, and he sees a vision, which may be more like a memory, of the Battle of Thermopylae, in which he is leading some men who speak his own tongue. They land, march to Sestos and make camp alongside the soldiers of Thought (Athens). Although the Rope Makers (Spartans) have come to help Thought with the siege, the alliance is uneasy, and there is a certain amount of dislike. Latro, Io and Drakaina accompany Pasicrate to visit Xanthippos, the strategist of Thought. Pasicrates quizzes him on his plans and expectations for the progress of the siege. After leaving him, as they assess the siege towers and battering rams, Drakaina says she was once a Princess of Aea (Colchis) when the Golden Fleece was there. In one of the towers they discover their friend, the black man. Drakaina speaks the black man's language and gives his back story, and Pasicrates hopes to send him into the city to start a revolt. Hypereides and Oior are there too. Returning to their camp, Pasicrates decides that Latro should be disciplined, and tries to have him beaten. Latro fights his way out and runs into the hills. Latro wakes to find the Maiden (Persephone) seated by him. She scolds him for running, but says she will keep her promise to reunite him with his friends, in return for the sacrifice of a wolf. Latro finds Drakaina and Io in the shadows of the city walls and the three of them are taken hostage into the city. The People from Parsa bring Latro to Artayctes, the satrap in charge of Sestos, and they make Latro fight three men at once. Latro asks for the Maiden's help, two ghosts appear, as blood is spilled one drinks, gains strength and slows one of Latro's opponents. The ghost who drank is Odysseus and the other Achilles. Artayctes says he plans to sneak out the city with his people, to return to the Great King (Xerxes I) and invites Latro to join him, Latro accepts and arms himself. He rides a horse with Drakaina seated behind him, having left Io behind. It was a trick, they are ambushed, and the satrap left another way. Latro loses track of time, looking for Drakaina, he sees her body being mauled by an injured wolf with the face of a man who reminds him they were brothers (it was Oior), and begs him to end his life. Latro sacrifices the wolf-man to the Maiden. From Drakaina's mouth escapes a snake. Once it is gone, the woman tells Latro her name is Eurykles. A dying man calls for ‚ÄòLucius‚Äô, and Latro recognises his own name, he holds his friend's hand as the man dies.

Heritage listing  As at 24 November 2000, Bomen station group and residence was a rare one-off design station from the boom period of railway construction. Of particular importance is the continuous pitched roof extending over the platform and the recessed verandah on the street side. The verandah column details are also unusual. The intactness of the buildings is also of significance. The inclusion of the well is an unusual element in a station group. This station was the terminus of the southern line from September 1878 to September 1879 while the rail bridge over the Murrumbidgee River and flood plain was finished. They are focal buildings in the small township of Bomen and indicate the former significance of the site in the development of the railway system throughout the state. The Bomen railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.

Mosquito-equipped squadrons performed medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attack and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive.Bowman 2005, p. 7. Mosquitos were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, which marked targets for night-time strategic bombing. Despite an initially high loss rate due to low-level daylight attack operations, the Mosquito ended the war with the lowest losses of any of the aircraft types in RAF Bomber Command service. Performance On its introduction to service, the aircraft was about as fast as the German fighters that opposed it, particularly the Bf 109F and the Fw 190A. Although the differential in speed was low, the agility of the Mosquito was often an advantage. Aerial interception usually occurred when enemy fighters had already been \\"scrambled\\" by reports of visual sightings as the flights crossed the Continental coastlines. Occasionally, the daylight low-level raiding Mosquito squadrons simply had back luck, as was the case with the Oslo Mosquito raid, 25 September 1942, when a crack Luftwaffe squadron of Focke- Wulf Fw 190 fighters of 3/JG 5 had just arrived in Norway. In the first few years of Mosquito service, most of the dedicated Luftwaffe night fighter groups were equipped with aircraft such as the Bf 110 or Junkers Ju 88, both of lower performance. There were enemy attempts to address this but problems included engine troubles and the intensifying Allied bombing campaign, especially as the USAAF daylight bombing started to complement the RAF Bomber Command campaign. In terms of better propeller-driven night fighters, the Heinkel He 219 and Junkers Ju 388 simply did not enter large-scale production. With the introduction of the nitrous oxide-boosted Messerschmitt Bf 109 G series and, in the spring of 1944,Radinger & Schick 1996, p. 49 the jet- powered Me 262, the Luftwaffe had relatively low numbers of fighters with a speed and altitude capability effectively to intercept the pressurised variants of Mosquito. But the German High Command would not give clear orders for their quantity production, which in any case would have been difficult because construction work had to be taken further east and carried out in concealed factories and tunnels. Aircraft fuel supplies were by then also becoming highly critical for the Nazis. Hitler in particular was at this stage fixated on \\"vengeance\\" weapons rather than fighters, denying leaders such as Adolf Galland any effective resources. Nevertheless, on 25 July 1944, a PRXVI Mosquito from No. 544 Squadron RAF was intercepted in the Munich area and attacked by Leutnant Alfred Schreiber, flying an Me 262 A-1a. The German fighter made six passes at the Mosquito MM 273, crewed by F/L A.E. Wall and F/O A.S. Lobban, but they managed to escape into cloud after violent evasive manoeuvers, making an emergency landing at Fermo airfield in Italy. The PR Mk 32 photo reconnaissance Mosquito design attempted to counter the threat of the German jets with extended, long-span wings, special high-altitude superchargers and the elimination of as much weight as possible, raising its cruising altitude to 42,000 ft (13,000 m), above the service ceiling of the Me 262. RAF Bomber Command 4,000-pound \\"Cookie\\" into a 692 Squadron B Mk IV (modified) at RAF Graveley, 1944 =Low-level Daylight Attack Phase= From around the start of June 1942 to the end of May 1943, the two RAF Squadrons who were the first to be equipped with Mosquito Mk. B.IV bombers operated as a low-level daylight bomber force in precision raids. On 15 November 1941, 105 Squadron, RAF, took delivery at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, of the first operational Mosquito Mk. B.IV, serial no. W4064.Scott 1999, p. 6. For nearly a year, in 1942 and 1943, 105 Sdn., based next at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks.Wooldridge 1993, Frontispiece.. On 29 August 1942, Mk IVs of 105 Squadron RAF undertook a bombing mission against Pont-√†-Vendin. They were attacked head-on by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s that then turned to fire again from the stern. The Mosquitos used their speed to outpace the 190s. On 19 September, Mosquitos attacked Berlin for the first time in daylight. Once again, when a Mosquito piloted by D.A.G ‚Ä≥George‚Ä≥ Parry was attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, he was able to outrun them. One Mosquito failed to return.Bowman 2005, p. 34. Another of the early low-level missions was the Oslo raid on 25 September 1942, carried out by four aircraft of No. 105 Squadron RAF, after which the Mosquito was publicly revealed for the first time.Bowman 1998, p. 13. The second squadron to be re-equipped with the Mosquito bombers was 139 Squadron, based alongside No. 105 Sqn. at RAF Horsham St. Faith and then Marham. Their aircraft started to be delivered in September 1942; meanwhile they shared some machines of No. 105 Squadron. On 6 December 1942 Mosquitos from 105 and 139 Squadrons participated in Operation Oyster, the 2 Group daylight raid against the Philips works at Eindhoven. During the months from mid-1942 to the end of May 1943, they participated in the low-level daylight attack phase described by Wooldridge, including the first day of Berlin raids. =First Berlin raids= On 30 January 1943, two daylight missions were carried out to bomb Berlin using low-level daylight tactics. These attacks were timed to disrupt speeches by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, head of the air force, and Joseph Goebbels, the Third Reich's Propaganda Minister. The first, in the morning, comprised a flight of three Mosquito B Mk. IVs from 105 Squadron, which attacked the main Berlin broadcasting station,History of the de Havilland Mosquito RAAF Museum at 11:00, when G√∂ring was due to address a parade commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Nazis' being voted into power. The mission gave the lie to G√∂ring's claim that such a mission was impossible, and kept G√∂ring off the air for more than an hour. A second flight of Mosquitos from 139 Squadron followed in the afternoon of the same day to attempt to interrupt a speech by Goebbels at the Sports Palace. Once again, they bombed at the exact planned time. However, Berlin's anti-aircraft defences were on the alert and a Mosquito flown by Squadron Leader D.F.W. Darling DFC was shot down, killing both Darling and his navigator.Bowman 1997, p. 19Bowman 2005, p. 37. G√∂ring was enraged; six weeks later he harangued aircraft manufacturers that he could \\"go berserk\\" when faced with the Mosquito, which made him \\"green and yellow with envy\\".Boog et al. 2006, p. 407. =Pathfinder operations= Within Bomber Command, Pathfinder Operations were set up by (at the time) Acting Group Captain Donald Bennett, who was appointed Commander of Pathfinders (PFF) on 5 July 1942 After completing its initial Oboe trials work, No. 109 Squadron RAF moved with its Mosquito B.IV's to RAF Wyton in August 1942. There it joined the re-formed No 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group, where the newly appointed Donald Bennett had just set up his HQ.\\"Bennett\\" pp=202-203, 210 A calibration sortie over enemy territory took place on 20/21 December, using six 109 Sqn. Mosquitos to locate and bomb a power station at Lutterade in Holland. Then on 31 December/1 January 1943, 109 Squadron pioneered PFF Oboe target marking for eight Lancaster bombers that attacked D√ºsseldorf.\\"Bennett\\" pp=217-218 Mosquito bombers were soon an important aircraft within PFF operations. They became the main element of the Light Night Striking Force (LNSF) and from early in 1943, they were used for target marking, particularly in the initial phases of the raid, when their pyrotechnics would be followed up by additions from the heavy Pathfinder bombers. The LNSF carried out high speed night raids with precision aiming and navigation. Their mission was twofold: they targeted small but vital installations; and acted as a diversion from the raids of the heavy bombers, simulating large formations through the use of Window or chaff. On nights when no heavy bomber raid was planned, the LNSF would continue to deny the German air defences a rest by means of 'nuisance raids' that were of increasing ferocity as the Group acquired more Mosquito bombers. On 1 June 1943, the two pioneering Squadrons, 105 and 139, joined No. 109 Squadron within the LNSF whose \\"nuisance raids\\" were already gaining approval from Harris and Churchill.\\"Bennett\\" p. 236 Initially they were engaged in moderately high level (about 10 000 ft.) night bombing, diversionary raids and dropping Window. They made 67 trips that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, some of the 105 Squadron aircraft were equipped with Oboe (navigation). In June 1943 109 Squadron received Mosquito B.IX's, also fitted for Oboe, and with their higher altitude capability they were able to extend its range. Other Mosquito Squadrons were added to No.8 PF Group with better Marks of the bomber, starting with B.IX's going to 139 Squadron.Birtles Chapter 8 As Mosquito bomber production increased towards the end of 1943, No. 627 Squadron RAF was one of the first new bomber squadron to be added to the PFF. Based at RAF Oakington, it was staffed from part of 139 Squadron and equipped at first with B.IV's. It was involved in PFF attacks on Berlin in early 1944. Bennett was permitted to add considerably to the number of PFF Mosquito Squadrons - by May 1945 there were twelve of these, including the detached No. 627 Sqn. which was in No. 5 Group.\\"Bennett\\" pp 348 - 349 The expanding PFF Mosquito squadrons visited all of the well-known targets in Germany including Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Essen, Mannheim, Hanover, and Duisberg. They took part in many bombing operations as pathfinders, marking targets with flares for the massed formations of heavy bombers. Once the B.XVI variants with enlarged bomb bays were brought into service in February 1944, they dropped 4,000-lb blast bombs (\\"cookies\\") which were used on many raids, making the force a formidable weapon in its own right.Bennett, pp. 274-275 During 20/21 February to 27/28 March 1945 inclusive, No. 139 squadron made a series of 36 consecutive night attacks on Berlin with these large bombs. During the allied advance across France, the Pathfinder group, due to the persistence of Vice Marshall Bennett,A.S. Jackson expanded its brief to perform short notice raids, such as the blind bombing, using Oboe, of the road from Falaise on 19 August 1944, as well as of St. Vith crossroads, during the Battle of the Bulge. The group also developed techniques for destroying railway tunnels by \\"skip bombing\\" delayed fuse bombs into tunnel mouths, and destroyed numerous other targets immediately behind the German lines as its brief was widened, along with that of the Mosquitos of No. 100 Group Bomber Command, to attack the enemy almost wherever they saw fit. The task of destroying V-1 launching sites was given to the group, as well as to others. It is the efficiency of these raids by Mosquitos that provides the generally quoted improvement of about 5 times over other bombers. It is estimated by the RAF that it took only 40 tons of bombs on average for them to destroy a site, versus 165 tons for a B-17, 182 tons for a B-26, and 219 for a B-29. A Mosquito B.IX holds the record for the most combat missions flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. 'LR503', known as \\"F for Freddie\\" because of its squadron code letters, GB*F, first served with 109 and subsequently 105 Squadron of the RAF. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash on 10 May 1945, two days after VE Day at Calgary airport during the 8th Victory Loan Bond Drive, killing both the pilot Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar. =Bomber Support= In 1943 Luftwaffe night fighters were causing serious losses by attacking the bomber streams over Germany. Consequently, the decision was taken to set up 100 Group within Bomber Command. This new Group commenced operations on 8 November 1943 under Air Cdr. E. B. Addison.Birtles Chapter 12 The Group's initial squadrons were No. 169 Squadron RAF and No. 239 Squadron RAF. Not long after, No. 141 Squadron RAF, based at RAF West Raynham, also joined them. On the night of 16/17 December, during the Battle of Berlin, one of their aircraft scored Bomber Command's first intruder success using the Serrate radar detector in a Mosquito NF.II, when they damaged a Bf 110 with cannon fire.Harris 1993, p. 43. No. 85 Squadron RAF was transferred to the Group on 1 May 1944, operating from RAF Swannington.Rickard, J. No. 85 Squadron (RAF): Second World War.28 January 2008.Accessed 26 Oct 2017 The top Mosquito ace of 100 Group was the distinguished Wing Commander Branse Burbridge, who made 13 claims during his time in this squadron, between 1944 and the end of the war in Europe.RAF 85 Squadron >Home >History >History RAF Formations >Historic Squadrons >85 Squadron https://www.raf.mod.uk/history/85squadron.cfm The 100 Group squadrons used progressively better marks of Mosquito according to their roles: NF XIXs and NF 30s were used for dedicated night fighter operations, providing escorts for the bomber streams; F Mk IIs and FB Mk VIs were used for \\"Flower\\" operations (patrolling enemy airfields ahead of the main stream and bombing to keep enemy night fighters on the ground as well as attacking night fighters in the landing pattern) and \\"Mahmoud\\" operations, in which, operating independently of bomber stream activity, the squadrons flew to assembly points for German night fighters and attacked them there. B Mk IVs and PR Mk XVIs were used for Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) operations, aiming to detect German radar and radio transmissions. Some 258 Luftwaffe night fighters were claimed by the Group, for the loss of some 70 Mosquitos. The omnipresence of the potent night fighter threat led to what the Luftwaffe crews dubbed \\"Moskitoschreck\\" (Mosquito terror), since the German aircrews were never sure when or where they might come under attack. Indirectly this led to a high proportion of enemy aircraft and crew losses from crashes as night fighters hurried in to land to avoid the Mosquito threat, whether real or imagined. =Highball variants= When Barnes Wallis was designing the Upkeep bouncing bomb to destroy German dams, he also designed a smaller version ‚Äî Highball ‚Äî for enemy shipping.Thirsk 2006, pp. 78‚Äì81. It was decided that the Mosquito was an ideal aircraft for the purpose. Hence 618 Squadron was formed on 1 April 1943 under Coastal Command.. The role of the new unit was to attack enemy shipping, giving priority to the German battleship . Mosquito conversions were made to aircraft of the Mk IV series II. Bomb bay doors were removed and specialised carriers were fitted for two Highballs weighing 1,280 lb (580 kg) each. Before release these were spun at 700 to 900 rpm by a ram air turbine in the bomb bay, fed by an air scoop. These weapons were to be dropped from a maximum altitude of 60 ft (20 m) at a speed of 360 mph (600 km/h). Highball was never used operationally since, on 12 November 1944, Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Lancasters carrying Tallboy bombs, in Operation Catechism. The unit was then selected for carrier-borne operations in the Pacific, but again, not used in warfare. These Mosquitos were transported to Australia on board the carriers and , arriving on 23 December 1944. In order to keep up aircrew proficiency and safeguard the modified Mosquitos, 12 disassembled FB Mk VIs were also sent, arriving in Sydney in February 1945. These were reassembled at de Havilland Australia's Mascot factory. The unit was disbanded at RAAF Narromine in July 1946.

Secret Projects: British Fighters and Bombers 1935‚Äì1950 (British Secret Projects 3). Leicester, UK: Midland Publishing, 2004. . The first night fighter Mosquito introduced into service was the NF Mk II in mid-1942, with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano cannons in the fuselage belly and four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine-guns mounted in the nose. It carried the Aircraft Interception radar (AI) Mk IV / Mk V when operating as a defensive night fighter over the UK, although at the time this was omitted from Mk IIs operating as night \\"Intruders\\", roaming over Europe at night to cause maximum disruption to lines of communications and flying operations.Sharp and Bowyer, 1971, pp. 338‚Äì339. These were fitted with the Serrate radar detector to allow them to track down German night fighters by emissions from their own Lichtenstein B/C, C-1, or SN-2 radar, as well as a device codenamed Perfectos that tracked emissions from German IFF systems. On 30 May 1942, the NF Mk II scored its first kill,Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 152, 454. a Dornier Do 217 of Kampfgeschwader 2.Bowman 2005, p. 173. By the end of the war, Mosquito night fighters had claimed approximately six hundred piloted enemy aircraft, along with about the same number of pilotless V-1 flying bombs. Among this total were 68 single-engined Focke-Wulf Fw 190s.Bowman 2005, pp. 173‚Äì189. This variant also operated over Malta, Italy, Sicily and North Africa from late 1942 on. The Mosquito NF XII became the first aircraft to carry the highly effective centimetric radar. Mosquito night fighters continued to operate over Europe until the end of the war with a low casualty rate, in spite of the efforts of the Heinkel He 219-equipped units and Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters which were flown at night by pilots from 10./NJG 11. The commander of this unit, Oberleutnant Kurt Welter, claimed perhaps 25 Mosquitos shot down by night and two further Mosquitos by day while flying the Me 262, adding to his previous seven Mosquito kills in high- performance Bf 109G-6/AS or Fw 190 A-8 fighters. From September 1944 through to May 1945 a total of 92 night-flying Mosquitos of all marks on bombing, target marking, intruder and night fighter operations were lost.Sharpe and Bowyer 1971 As far as can be ascertained, three of the Me 262 claims over Mosquitos coincide with RAF records.Hinchcliffe 1996 Fighter-bomber operations 613 (City of Manchester) Squadron wearing 'D-Day stripes' at RAF Lasham in June 1944 Operation Jericho ‚Äî low-level aerial photo of Amiens Prison during the raid shows snow-covered buildings and landscape. The dark object at top right is the rear fuselage and incompletely retracted tailwheel of the photo Mosquito Operational experience in its varied roles quickly led to the development of a versatile fighter-bomber version; the FB VI, which first saw service in early 1943. The Mark VI had a strengthened wing for external loads and along with its standard fighter armament could carry two bombs in the rear of the bomb bay and two bombs under the wings, or eight wing-mounted rockets. Later up-engined versions could carry bombs. The FB VI became the most numerous version of the Mosquito (2,292 built), equipping the day bomber 2 Group, the intruder squadrons of Fighter Command and 2nd Tactical Air Force, and the strike wings of Coastal Command, who used the variant as a potent anti-shipping aircraft armed with eight \\"60 lb\\" rockets. One of the higher-risk uses of the fighter-bomber Mosquito FB VI was by 21 Sqn., 464 (RAAF) Squadron and 487 (NZ) Squadron of No. 2 Group, 2nd Tactical Air Force in Operation Jericho, a mission to destroy the walls and guards' quarters of Amiens prison to allow members of the French Resistance to escape. In the aftermath of the operation the Mosquito of Group Captain Percy Pickard was shot down.Bowan 2005, p. 78. On 11 April 1944, after a request by Dutch resistance workers, six Mosquito FB VIs of No. 613 (City of Manchester) Squadron made a pinpoint daylight attack at rooftop height on the Kunstzaal Kleykamp Art Gallery in The Hague, Netherlands, which was being used by the Gestapo to store the Dutch Central Population Registry. The first two aircraft dropped high explosive bombs, to \\"open up\\" the building, their bombs going in through the doors and windows. The other crews then dropped incendiary bombs, and the records were destroyed. Only persons in the building were killed ‚Äî nearby civilians in a bread queue were unharmed.Scholefield 1998, pp. 50‚Äì51.. On 21 March 1945, a similar raid, Operation Carthage, again by 21 Sqn., 464(RAAF) Sqn. and 487(NZ) Sqn., involved a very low-level bombing attack on the Gestapo headquarters in Shell House (Shellhus), near the centre of Copenhagen, Denmark. The attack had been requested several times by members of the Danish resistance, but was initially deemed too dangerous by the RAF. Twenty Mosquitoes were involved, split into three attack waves. They were escorted by 30 RAF Mustangs. The main attack on the Gestapo headquarters caused the death of 55 German soldiers and 47 Danes working for the Gestapo, together with destruction of the Gestapo records in the headquarters. Eight Gestapo prisoners were killed while 18 prisoners escaped. A Mosquito flying in the first wave of the attack struck a tall lamp-post and crashed into a nearby Catholic school (the French school). Mosquitoes of the third wave bombed this area by mistake, killing 86 children, 10 nuns, 8 teachers, and 21 other civilians; no civilians had been killed during the main attack. Four Mosquitoes were lost and nine pilots/crew members died. Following Operation Chastise (the famous \\"Dambusters raid\\"), Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, CO of RAF 617 squadron (Dambusters), developed a low-level dive-bombing method of target marking, expecting the main bombers to strike from a higher altitude.Brickhill Initially he experimented with the squadron's Lancaster bombers, but then he wished to use Mosquitos for precision target marking by a Master Bomber. Photo reconnaissance units Although the RAF had continued to use aerial photography since the end of World War I, by 1939 it had become a very under-developed and neglected branch of the service.Birtles, Chapter 11 On the eve of World War II, Sidney Cotton took aerial photos during flights over parts of the Middle East, North Africa and even over German military airfields. Using a pair of Lockheed 12A's based at Heston, just north of London, Cotton undertook a further programme of photographic flights over Germany and Italy, with camera improvements such as a warm-air blown unit that overcame condensation problems. Two weeks after war was declared, Cotton's photographs of the Dutch coast were used finally to convince RAF senior officers of his capabilities. He was appointed as an honorary RAF Squadron Leader on 22 September 1939 and tasked to head up a new RAF 1 Photographic Development Unit at Heston Aerodrome.Cotton 1969, p. 156. Cotton rapidly improved photo reconnaissance capabilities, working at first with a Bristol Blenheim (too slow), but soon acquiring a couple of Supermarine Spitfires that were rapidly adapted. Birtles gives the following reasons for the suitability of the Mosquito for PR operations: could carry more cameras than the Spitfire; long range combined with high speed; security of two engines; navigator could locate and identify targets whilst pilot concentrated on flying (and evasion when necessary). Later as more advanced variants were introduced, high altitude capability was added. On 13 July 1941, PR.1 W4051 LY-U was delivered to 1 PRU at RAF Benson. Two more aircraft were delivered in July and August. The first operational sortie by a PR Mk I of 1 PRU was flown in W4055 on 17 September 1941. During this flight reconnoitering the Biscay coasts of France, the pilot, Squadron Leader Clarke evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at .Bowman 2005, p. 27. In October, three PR Mosquitos were detached to RAF Wick to perform reconnaissance flights over Norway. Clarke flew back to Benson from Wick on 15 October in 1 hr. 32 m. - a record run. On 4 December, Sqn Ldr Alastair Taylor DFC with two bars and his navigator, Sgt. Sidney Horsfall, were lost in the Trondheim-Bergen area, becoming the first 1 PRU casualties. Improved longer-range standard PR.Mk.I Mosquitos were introduced at 1 PRU, Benson, in early 1942. This enabled more distant reconnaissance missions, to Poland, for example. Also from around that date there were searches and photographic evidence, by the RAF Leuchars detachment, concerning the German Scharnhorst-class battleships. And on 16 January 1942 this unit had a further success when a round-trip flight to Murmansk located the hiding place in a Norwegian fjord of the Tirpitz. Mosquito PR Mark IX of 1409 (Meteorological) Flight RAF, November 1944 In 1942 Benson airfield was given new runways and No.1 PRU was expanded. Placed under RAF Coastal Command, there were five new squadron numbers, Nos. 540 to 544 inclusive. Of these, Sqns. 540 and 544 were the most significant for ongoing Mosquito PR operations.\\"RAF Benson\\" In the spring of 1943 the No. 1409 Flight RAF (Meteorological Flight) was transferred to Bomber Command, and placed under No. 8 Group Pathfinder Force, based firstly at RAF Oakington. At that stage, it was using the PR Mark IX Mosquito but in 1944 it moved to RAF Wyton and received pressurised high altitude Mosquito PR XVIs. The crews, of which two were on constant standby, performed special reconnaissance duties. These included short-term on-the-spot meteorological reporting, containing photographs of weather conditions. Also, photographs of terrain and water features of topical intelligence significance. \\"Marcus Bicknell, transcription, 25 Sept 2013\\" The South African Air Force (SAAF) also served with distinction in PRU duties. In February 1943 60 Squadron acquired their first PR Mosquito II's at the instigation of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery whilst they were serving in North Africa.. In May 1943, the squadron was sent to USAAF San Severo in Italy This move was to prepare for the southern European campaign; the squadron was equipped with Mosquito PR XVI's, with red and white rudder stripes. They carried out large-scale photographic surveys of parts of Sicily and other Axis held areas, eventually ranging over the Alps and deep into Austria and Germany, where they met with dangerous interceptions by Me 262 jets. On 4 April 1944 the Squadron obtained the first photographic evidence of Nazi genocides when an aircraft accidentally photographed Auschwitz concentration camp, intending to photograph nearby rubber plantations. When analysed, the photographs showed rows of people lined up, plus chimneys and all the other characteristics of a death camp. With the cessation of hostilities, 60 Squadron assisted the RAF in a photo survey of Greece before being withdrawn from operations on 22 August 1945 after it had returned to AFS Zwartkop, South Africa. In 1945, an RAF PR Mk XVI Mosquito of Eastern Air Command operating out of airfields in Burma set a twin-engine record on a single photo- reconnaissance mission covering in 8 hours and 50 minutes.IBT Roundup, Far- Flying EAC Men Set Distance Record, Vol. III, No. 30 (5 April 1945) The PR Mk 34 was the final wartime photo reconnaissance version of the Mosquito, designed for long range reconnaissance in the Pacific. To increase its range it had no armor and its bulged bomb bay had a fuel tank, giving an internal fuel capacity of 1,192 gallons plus two 200 gallon drop tanks when required. Power was by two 1,635 hp Merlin 25's. With a full fuel load its range was 3,600 miles at a speed of 300 mph. It could reach , placing it among the fastest piston-engined aircraft of World War II.dhmosquito.com . De Havilland Mosquito. Retrieved on 23 May 2009. Tested in Britain in April‚ÄìMay 1945, it was then flown to India, establishing a new record time for the flight. Before the Japanese surrender, it conducted 38 sorties from the Cocos Islands, reaching destinations such as Sumatra and Malaya (Malaysia).\\"Rickard, J., 15 April 2007\\" The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) ordered 120 Mosquitos for photographic reconnaissance, but only 40 were delivered and given the U.S. designation F-8. These were built in Canada. There were six B Mk VII's and 34 B Mk XX's. Only 16 of these reached Europe, where 11 were turned over to the RAF and five were sent to Italy. The RAF also provided 145 Hatfield-built PR Mk XVI aircraft to the Eighth Air Force between February 1944 and the end of the war. These were used for a variety of photographic and night reconnaissance missions and also for covert operations. USAAF A Mosquito PR Mk XVI \\"Z\\" MM345 of the 653rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, 25th Bombardment Group at RAF Watton, England. This Hatfield-built aircraft was delivered in May 1944. The USAAF 25th Bombardment Group (Reconnaissance) was constituted in the days after D-Day and activated at RAF Watton in August 1944 to carry out photographic and mapping missions over mainland Europe, as the Allied armies pushed east. In addition to photo-reconnaissance missions both for weather forecasting and for target identifications, they employed their PR Mk XVI Mosquitos as Chaff (countermeasure) dispensers and as scouts for the heavy bomber force. They also undertook \\"[Joan-Eleanor ProjectJoan-Eleanor Log, RG226, NARA II, College Park, MD]\\" OSS missions using an air-to-ground radio system known as Joan-Eleanor system. This required modifications to the rear fuselage to accommodate an intelligence service linguist to talk to agents on the ground through a VHF radio. Additionally, some aircraft were used as H2X Mickey platforms. The 25th BG flew 3,246 sorties (including B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26, A-26 and Mosquito flights) and lost 29 PR Mk XVIs on operations (including takeoff accidents). During the latter part of the war, the 416th NFS in Italy used Mosquito NF.30s claiming one kill. Neutral country flights and BOAC service A passenger (right), who has been carried in the bomb-bay of a 'civilianised' De Havilland Mosquito FB VI of BOAC on the fast freight service from Stockholm, Sweden, with Captain Wilkins and his navigator on arrival at Leuchars, Scotland. Between 1943 and the end of the war, Mosquitos were used as transport aircraft on a regular route over the North Sea between Leuchars in Scotland and Stockholm, in neutral Sweden. Earlier, Lockheed Hudsons and Lodestars were used but these slower aircraft could only fly this route at night or in bad weather to avoid the risk of being shot down. During the long daylight hours of the Northern summer, the Mosquito was the safer alternative. To ensure that the flights did not violate Sweden's neutrality, the aircraft carried civilian markings and were operated by crews who were nominally \\"civilian employees\\" of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). They carried small, high value cargoes such as precision ball bearings and machine-tool steel, as well as Diplomatic Bags. Important passengers were also carried in an improvised \\"cabin\\" in the bomb bay. One such notable passenger was the physicist Niels Bohr, who was evacuated from Stockholm in 1943 in order to join the British Mission on the Manhattan Project. The flight almost ended in tragedy since Bohr did not don his oxygen equipment as instructed, and passed out. He would have died had not the pilot, surmising from Bohr's lack of response to intercom communication that he had lost consciousness, descended to a lower altitude for the remainder of the flight. Bohr's comment was that he had slept like a baby for the entire flight.  In USSR  Mosquitos acted in the USSR on reconnaissance duties operating from Soviet bases on the Kola peninsula to monitor Luftwaffe activities in Norway. The Soviets also made a request to acquire a Mosquito, so B.IV (DK296) was tested, but reports noted that it demanded high flying skills and no further purchases were made.Gordon 2008, pp. 509‚Äì510. A courier mail link between the Soviet and British governments, sometimes transporting VIP passengers was also maintained. Late in WWII, Mosquitos undertook a wide range of courier duties, often overflying and sometimes landing in neutral countries such as Sweden. In 1944, a Mosquito from RAF Benson was stripped of its photographic equipment and flew to Moscow in 4 hours, acting as a courier for the Moscow Conference (1944). As a result, Mosquito's from RAF Benson were given the further tasks of carrying diplomatic mail for the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference, both in 1945.RAF Benson - War Time. https://www.raf.mod.uk/RAFbenson/aboutus/wartime.cfm. Accessed 13 November 2017. Post-World War II Mosquitos flying with the Israeli Air Force saw action during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Although, at the time, the Mosquito was being taken out of service, 13 aircraft of various marks were taken out of storage. An additional 13 TR.33 ex-Fleet Air Arm Mosquitos were purchased from a British scrap dealer in 1954 and delivered via Blackbushe Airport in early 1955. The Dominican Air Force obtained five ex RAF FB.6s in 1948.Scholefield, 1998, p. 38 Sweden purchased 60 ex-RAF Mk XIX Mosquitos in 1948 to be used as a night fighter under the J 30 designation. The aircraft were assigned to the V√§stmanland Air Force Wing (F 1), thereby becoming the first (and only) dedicated night fighter unit of the Swedish Air Force. Its Mosquitos were replaced by jet fighters, de Havilland Venom Mk 51s (designated J 33), in 1953. One-third of the J 30s crashed or broke down during service, mainly due to rudder problems. Swedish Air Force General Bj√∂rn Bjuggren wrote in his memoirs that mechanical problems in the swivelling nose-mounted radar antenna caused destructive vibrations that broke apart one or two J 30s in the air. Mosquito B.35 of Spartan Air Services, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada after modification in 1955 for high-altitude surveys The Belgian Air Force operated 24 Mosquito NF 30s between 1949 and 1956. They were flown by 10 Smaldeel of 1 Wing based at Beauvechain Air Base until they were replaced in the night fighter role by Gloster Meteor NF 11s. MB-24 survives on display in the aviation museum in Brussels. In 1954, the Belgian Air Force also received three Mosquito FB 6s which had been converted to the target tug role.Scholefield 1998, p. 38 Some 150 to 200+ (sources differ) Canadian-built Mosquitos and spare engines were purchased by the Republic of China Air Force in 1947. Considerable numbers of these aircraft saw combat in 1947-49 during the civil war against Communist forces. Spartan Air Services of Ottawa Ontario acquired twelve ex-Royal Air Force Mosquito B.35s in 1955. These were modified by Derby Aviation at Derby (Burnaston) Airport for high altitude aerial survey. After ferrying over the Atlantic, they operated commercially throughout the Americas until the mid-1960s. Notable pilots In alphabetical order of surname, some notable Mosquito pilots were:-  Air Vice Marshal Robert Bateson CB, DSO & Bar, DFC (10 June 1912 ‚Äì 6 March 1986) ‚Äì During WWII he flew low-level raids against precision targets in occupied Europe. Born in Watford; attended the local grammar school. Joined RAF in July 1936 on a short service commission. First active service in No. 113 Squadron RAF, flying the Hawker Hind. In the Middle East, converted to the Bristol Blenheim; then commanded No. 211 Squadron RAF in the Far East. From February 1944, commanded No. 613 (City of Manchester) Squadron RAF, with Mosquito FB.VI's. One of several squadrons in No. 2 Group RAF that made low-level precision attacks. These included Gestapo Headquarters in The Hague, Central Records Registry, 11 April 1944; Copenhagen Operation Carthage, 'Shell House', 21 March 1945; Odense, Fyn, Denmark, 17 April 1945. Awarded a bar to his DSO for leading these attacks, the citation includes the words: - the highest standard of skill as the target was small and well defended‚Ä¶ the attack was pressed home with a determination and accuracy which ensured success. (Also) In April, 1945 (Odense attack) ‚Ä¶ In spite of opposition from the ground defences the attack was vigorously and accurately pressed home‚Ä¶ brilliant leadership ‚Ä¶ played an important part in the success of these notable sorties. Post-war he became a senior RAF officer and on retirement he had held a total of seven commands. * Don Bennett- Air Vice Marshal Donald Clifford Tyndall Bennett, CB, CBE, DSO. Began flying as a cadet in the Royal Australian Air Force, 16 July 1930. Short-service commission in the Royal Air Force 11 August 1931. From July 1940 flying superintendent, Atlantic Ferry service. Re-joined RAF on 25 September 1941 - acting Wing Commander. Promoted 1943 with upgrading of PFF to Group status - Air Commodore, then in December to acting Air Vice Marshal ‚Äî the youngest ever to hold that rank. In July 1942, acting Group Captain Bennett was directed by Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris to command the Pathfinder Force (PFF), Bomber Command. Previously only one in three of the heavy bombers was attaining strikes within five miles (8 km) of the target yet loss rates were appalling. Guiding main formations using radar and pyrotechnics, PFF greatly improved the accuracy and effectiveness. Bennett saw the potential of the underestimated Mosquito, and it was used in relatively small numbers in each raid as the leading aircraft flight. By May 1945 Bennett had eleven Mosquito squadrons doing this work and frequently, against regulations, he would fly one himself to observe the marking of targets during the attacks.\\"Biography Don Bennett\\" * Bob Braham, DSO & Two Bars, DFC & Two Bars, AFC, CD ‚Äì The most decorated RAF fighter pilot of the Second World War and a top night fighter ace. * Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom, KCB, CBE, DSO, AFC - He flew three tours of bomber operations, gaining the DSO for leading Mosquito raids over Berlin. First operations were in Bristol Blenheims. In 1941, flew from besieged Malta on shipping sweeps. In May 1943, became an instructor in No. 1655 Mosquito Training Unit, training No. 8 Pathfinder Group pilots. In May 1944 joined No. 571 Squadron, flying Mosquito XVI's in the Light Night Striking Force. His navigator was Flt. Lt. Tommy Broom and the pair were nicknamed \\"the flying brooms,\\" with an emblem of crossed broomsticks on their aircraft. They carried 4000 lb \\"cookies\\" in numerous raids over Berlin (the \\"milk run\\"!). In autumn 1944, became acting Squadron Leader in No. 128 LNSF Mosquito squadron. In January 1945 made acting Wing Commander and C.O. of No. 163 LNSF squadron, Tommy Broom joining him as squadron navigation officer. At end of WWII, still aged only 24, had done 58 operational missions in Mosquitos, including 22 over Berlin; 103 operational sorties in total. Continued a distinguished RAF career until 1977. * Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown, CBE, DSC, AFC, Hon FRAeS, RN ‚Äì Test pilot credited in the Guinness Book of Records as having flown 487 - the greatest number - of aircraft types in the world; performed deck landing trials of the Sea Mosquito, the heaviest aircraft yet flown from a British carrier. On 25 March 1944 he put it down on HMS Indefatigable. Previously, British carrier aircraft had only been single- engine and generally only about half the weight. * Branse Burbridge, DSO & Bar, DFC & Bar ‚Äì The RAF's highest scoring Mosquito night fighter ace, mainly achieved whilst in No. 85 Squadron. * Leonard Cheshire, VC, OM, DSO, DFC - Group Captain. As a Pathfinder flying RAF Lancasters, Cheshire requested and was given a Mosquito for personal use to perfect novel Pathfinding techniques whilst serving as 617 Squadron commander. (In 617 he had succeeded Guy Gibson); His 1944 VC cited his dive over Munich in a Mosquito, enduring \\"withering\\" fire for many minutes. The youngest Group Captain in the RAF at the time; a distinguished exponent of Pathfinder precision marking. From 1948, Cheshire devoted his life to the care of the disabled and terminally ill, founding the Cheshire Homes. In 1991 Cheshire was created a life peer. * Sidney Cotton ‚Äì Australian civilian photographic reconnaissance pioneer. Set up a PR unit at RAF Heston, London, flying the Lockheed 12a. Was given an officer rank by RAF, but became too unruly and left. Cotton also developed the flying suit bearing his name. * John Cunningham (RAF officer) (Final Rank Group Captain), CBE, DSO & Two Bars, DFC & Bar, AE ‚Äì John Cunningham tested the prototype W4050 on 9 February 1941 and was \\"greatly impressed by the lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\\". He travelled to Canada and onwards to Australia to set up the DH Mosquito works. Commanding No. 85 Squadron RAF, he became a night fighter ace on several variants of Mosquito Night Fighter, including the pressurised H.A. type. On 9 June 1944 he took off from RAF Uxbridge and overflew the British sector of Normandy in the DH Vampire (fuselage pod a timber sandwich shell like the Mosquito). On 1 December 1945 he resumed work as a Senior Test pilot for DH, flying types including the DH Vampire and the Comet jet airliner. * Geoffrey de Havilland Jr, ‚Äì Son of the founder of DH and chief test pilot of the firm, flew the maiden flight of the Mosquito and that of the DH Vampire. Died on 27 September 1946 whilst carrying out high speed tests in the DH 108 TG306 which broke up over the Thames estuary. * Bill Edrich DFC ‚Äì Squadron Leader. English international cricketer, who played against Miller. Graduated from Blenheims to Mosquitos. * Hughie Edwards (Final Rank, Honour and Decorations: Air Commodore Sir Hughie Idwal Edwards, VC, KCMG, CB, DSO, OBE, DFC (1 August 1914 ‚Äì 5 August 1982) From 1 August 1942, (then) Wing Commander Hughie Edwards re- convened No. 105 Squadron RAF - the first squadron of Mosquito Mk.IV bombers. Edwards had won a Victoria Cross in July 1941. Leading No. 105 Mosquito Squadron, on 6 December 1942, Edwards directed Mosquitos, Douglas Bostons and Lockheed Venturas in ‚ÄòOperation Oyster‚Äô, the daylight low-level raid on the Philips electrical works at Eindhoven. Fourteen aircraft were downed, and the factory was substantially damaged. Civilian casualties were reduced by operating on a Sunday.\\"Operation Oyster\\" Whilst leading 105 Squadron Mosquitos, he also flew the first daylight attack on Berlin. * Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Neil Foxley-Norris GCB, DSO, OBE, FRSA Commissioned RAFVR December 1938. Flew all through WWII - Battle of France Army Co- operation, No. 13 Squadron RAF, Westland Lysanders; Battle of Britain three Hurricane squadrons‚ÄîNos. 111, 3, and 615 (County of Surrey); flying instructor in England and Canada; returned UK June 1943, subsequently on Beaufighter and Mosquito F.B. low-level anti-shipping operations at bases including RAF North Coates and RAF St. Eval. After brief spell in Middle East, appointed Acting Wing Commander No. 143 Squadron RAF - part of the RAF Banff Strike Wing. Flying Mosquito FB VI's armed with RP's, they successfully attacked U Boats and surface shipping. His DSO citation says he \\"operated against a wide range of enemy targets ‚Ä¶ by his brilliant leadership, exceptional skill and determination ‚Ä¶ contributed in good measure to the successes obtained.\\" Post- war, permanently commissioned and served in Singapore; Fighter Command (whilst still flying Javelins), Commander-in-Chief RAF Germany in the late 1960s and a series of other senior appointments, becoming Air Chief Marshall.Humphrey Wynn, ‚ÄòNorris, Sir Christopher Neil Foxley (1917‚Äì2003)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2009;edition January 2009 accessed 21 Dec 2017 * Kerkorian, Kirk ‚Äì Ferry pilot for Mosquitos from Canada to Britain and elsewhere during World War II.

In later life when asked how he dealt with pressure on the cricket field, Miller replied: \\"Pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse, playing cricket is not.\\" * Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski DFC ‚Äì famous Polish pilot who flew a Breguet 19 from Warsaw-Tokyo-Warsaw in 1926 and, with a PZL P.24, set a speed record on 28 June 1934. Commanding officer of Polish 305 Squadron, he flew a Mosquito in a mission against German prison camp in Lille and a large German fuel dump at Nomexy. * Wing Commander D. A. G. (\\"George\\") Parry RAFVR DSO, MBE, DFC, AE - A pioneer in introducing the very first Mosquito Mk.IV bombers in service, in RAF No. 105 Squadron. He was called up from RAFVR (London, 1938) at the onset of war, and sent to 10 FTS, then 13 OTU (RAF Bicester) as a trainee Blenheim Mk.IV pilot.Imperial War Museums- Collections His first operational squadron was No. 110, at RAF Wattisham, flying Blenheim Mk.IV's. Flying mainly by daylight, their targets included Channel ports, waterways and Axis airfields. Parry's first combat tour ended on 13 October 1940 and he was posted back to 13 OTU, Bicester, to train Blenheim pilots. But in October 1941 he was invited to re-join active operations in No. 105 Squadron, Swanton Morley, where the new Mosquito Mk.IV bombers were arriving. * Percy Charles Pickard DSO and 2 bars, DFC ‚Äì English Group Captain who starred in film Target for Tonight early in the war.

It was conceived as an urban utopia by an ambitious entrepreneur named William T. Love in the 1890s. He planned it to be \\"The most beautiful [park] in the world\\" and planned housing for more than 1 million people and a canal and hydroelectric plant. Love promised in his advertising pamphlets that the city would be free of smog-filled skies, that the land would be beautifully landscaped, housing and quality of life would be a cut above even the loveliest urban environments. However, his plans were never realized, and amid the panic of 1894 his investors backed out. He went on to manage an Ontario gold mine a few years later, leaving his projects idle. He had only built a few streets before he became bankrupt. Relation to Love Canal The name of Love Canal came from the name of William T. Love. His \\"Love's Canal\\", which would connect the two levels of the Niagara River, would be the basis for this booming Model City. It would be a shipping lane. He became bankrupt after digging only 4,600 feet of his canal, this segment of which was within the present-day city of Niagara Falls, New York. He had also constructed a few streets, which would lead him further into bankruptcy. This same canal, after being used as a toxic waste dump and holding more than 20,000 tons of chemical waste, had a school and a neighborhood built on top of it. It subsequently became a major environmental disaster that would be exposed in the 1970s.

It is the first story Don Rosa did for Egmont. The first American publication was in Donald Duck Adventures (series II) #22, in March 1992. Plot Donald Duck has started a gardening and landscaping business. The mayor of Duckburg has hired him to take care of his garden so that he can hold a garden party for Duckburg's elite. Donald and his nephews arrive at the mayor's mansion where they are greeted by the mayor, his wife, and their large tomcat. Donald sets to work, with perfect finesse and attention to detail: for example, he mows the lawn in front of the stables with a group of trained rabbits, shaves the garden trees to perfect spheres, and makes a sculpture from a large bush. However, when Donald tries to mow the main lawn with two lawnmowers at once, he accidentally sets them into full speed, losing control of them. This causes a sequence of increasingly catastrophic incidents, during which the mayor's garden is totally destroyed, ending up looking like a battle site. The story ends with Donald hiding from the mayor and his wife, who are looking to punish Donald for the damages.

It served the village of Galong. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The original station opened in 1877. However, it was replaced by a new station on a deviation which opened in 1916. Galong was the location of the junction of the branch railway to Boorowa, which closed to passenger services in 1974.Galong station. NSWrail.net. Accessed 8 August 2009.  Description  The station complex consists of two initial island side platform station buildings of a type 11 design with brick platforms, dating from 1915, a brick out of shed on the southbound platform, also dating from 1915, and a goods shed of a side shed sub-type 3 design. A T208 10 ton gantry crane also forms part of the heritage listing. A 14062 Pooley 20 ton was formerly at the station but is no longer extant, possibly removed with transfer of part of the railway land to GrainCorp.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Galong station and yard group is an excellent example of a location which was constructed largely at the same time and retains that form to the present day. It is a good example of deviation site where the former wayside platform was replaced with 2 platforms and 2 buildings when the line was duplicated and deviated in 1915. The station buildings are excellent examples of standard buildings constructed in a country location, only a few of which survive (e.g. Binalong). It is a good and rare surviving country example of a signal box constructed as part of the main station building, again a result of the common building time of the structures. As a junction station for the Boorowa branch (now closed) the site had an importance that is reflected in the quality of the structures, particularly for buildings built as late as 1915 when most locations were suffering from cutbacks and rationalised construction. It is one of the finest country examples of buildings from this period. The ancillary structures such as weighbridge, gantry crane and goods shed are significant to the whole and are good examples of their type, strengthening the significance of the group. The residence is a remnant of the original 1877 station and is significant because of this connection. Galong railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as arch rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.
