After publishing a newspaper from April 1998 until January 2010, the people behind the project have since then run a news portal under the same name. Its first issue appeared on April 20, 1998, published by a group of journalists from Blic daily who, led by Manojlo Vukotiƒá, left to form their own newspaper. Initially, their new paper carried the Novi Blic name, but the Belgrade Commercial Court put a stop to that by issuing an immediate injunction citing copyright infringement. After 5 issues, on April 25, 1998, the paper appeared under its current name,Retrospektiva svega onoga ≈°ta je pre≈æivela redakcija \\"Glasa javnosti\\" od prvog broja lista do dana≈°njeg dvehiljaditog - Pratio nas Bog i ƒçitaoci; Glas javnosti, 7 March 2004 which the staff took from a long-forgotten 19th century publication. Modern Glas javnosti assumes a continuity from a newspaper of the same name published in Kragujevac during the 19th century. The first issue of that Glas javnosti came out on July 15, 1874. Glas is financially managed by Radisav Rodiƒá who also owns Kurir. Initially, the paper's editor-in-chief duties were performed by Manojlo Vukotiƒá, who was succeeded by Sreƒáko Petriƒá, Milan Beƒçejiƒá, Slavoljub Kaƒçareviƒá, Maja Vojinoviƒá, Petar Laziƒá, Ivan ƒåorbiƒá, Slavica Jovoviƒá, and Ljiljana Staletoviƒá. The FR Yugoslavian authorities frequently went after Glas. On the 2nd and 3 October 1999, the paper ceased publication due to an official injunction, citing three unregistered workers at the ABC grafika printing company. The ban was widely seen as retribution for the paper's decision to print and distribute a bulletin by the Alliance for Change opposition coalition. In January 2012, the newspaper ceased publishing its print issue. The plan was to continue with the web-portal and eventually go back to print publishing.

The \\"Visitors\\" are reptilian humanoids who disguise themselves to look human but prefer to eat live prey, such as mice. In the 1983 and 1984 miniseries (but not the 1984 TV series) the disguised Visitors can be told apart from humans by a reverberating echo in their voices. The re-imagined 2009 versions lack that vocal attribute and thus appear more human. Since the Visitors of both versions are reptilian in origin and nature, females reproduce by laying eggs after mating that eventually hatch into infant aliens. All Visitors are given human names for the humans' convenience. They are never heard to use their home-world names. The Leader The Leader (or commonly referred to by the Visitors as \\"Our Great Leader\\") is the head of a military dictatorship that controls the population on Sirius 4 and controls every resource and ship-of- the-line in the entire Sirian Fleet through its ministers. The Leader is constantly mentioned, but never seen; however, in the final episode, he actually has dialogue when we hear him (offscreen) speaking to Elizabeth. In most references to the Leader, the character is described as male, but the descriptions in The Second Generation refer to the Leader as a female entity. Supreme Commanders=John= John (Richard Herd) is introduced in V. The Supreme Commander of the fleet of Visitor ships. John is charismatic and likeable, evidently well-trained or well-prompted in public relations. He is the first Visitor that humans see, showing that they are just like humans. However, John is usually extremely busy touring the fleet attending to command issues, or reclusive when not needed to promote good will to the people of Earth. His appearance at the Los Angeles Medical Center on a worldwide broadcast to announce a cure for cancer is used by the Resistance to unmask him and show the people of Earth that the Visitors have been deceiving them. However it quickly becomes clear that John is something of a bureaucrat, enjoying the limelight and privileges that being a Supreme Commander brings but is considered by some (including Diana) to be \\"a fool who makes pretty speeches\\", while Diana organized the entire operation. John is later persuaded by Pamela to restrict Diana's command responsibilities. John is later killed by Diana when he refuses to carry out the Leader's order to destroy Earth when the Resistance routs the Visitors. =Pamela= Pamela (Sarah Douglas) is introduced in V: The Final Battle. She is the squadron commander and Diana's superior. She takes over command of the L.A. Mothership. Pamela's ship arrives at Earth a year into the occupation and begins a project to speed up acquisition of Earth's water. Pamela scorns Diana's claim of the Leader's special favor, pointing out that Diana's \\"lover\\" sent Diana 56 trillion miles away. Diana kills Pamela after being ordered to work strictly in the scientific field. =Charles= Charles (Duncan Regehr) is introduced in V: The Series. Sent by The Leader to take over military operations from Diana and become the new Supreme Commander, Charles sets in motion the chain of events that lead to the death of Nathan Bates. Charles is a member of the House of Raman, a very powerful and influential family, possibly even royalty, he has the power to choose his own bride and marry her within twelve hours of the betrothal. He has a well-known reputation as a ladies man, appealing to all the women in the fleet, apart from Diana who resents him taking over her command. He is romantically attached to Lydia, although he drops her in favor of Diana, whom he decides to marry in order to force her to return to the Homeworld, and bear his offspring, having become annoyed at her defiance. However, when he sees Diana naked in a ceremonial bath before their wedding, he decides that he would rather keep Diana around, Lydia attempts to poison her, but ends up killing Charles instead. Commanders=Diana= Diana (Jane Badler) is introduced in V. Sadistic, ruthless and brilliant, her ambition is matched only by her arrogance and cruelty. She is the second-in- command, as well as John's chief science officer of the fleet of 50 Visitor ships. She is commander of the mother ship over Los Angeles (although for the first few days after arrival, she is aboard the New York mother ship). In V, Diana is responsible for much of the Visitors attacks against the Resistance as well as ordering one of her lovers, Brian, to impregnate Robin Maxwell as part of an experiment. In V: The Final Battle, which takes place a year later, Pamela, her squadron commander, arrives, reminding Diana of her inferior rank; Pamela decides to discredit Diana and remove her from any operational duties (it is implied they have a history). Diana later murders Pamela. It becomes clear that Diana is the real power behind the Visitors as she organises much or their events and attacks. She convinces Christine Walsh to become the Visitors spokesperson and later murders her when she pleas for the Resistance live on television, after John's real face is exposed and she has the loyalty and support of most of the fleet, except for Steven and Pamela who attempt to discredit her to advance their own agendas. At the end of the Final Battle when defeat is imminent, Diana chooses to destroy Earth rather than letting the Resistance claim victory, telling John he is a fool and angry at his bureaucracy. After murdering John she attempts to escape with Elizabeth, but ends up leaving by herself. When V: The Series begins, it takes place straight after Diana escapes, where she is quickly captured by Mike Donovan and imprisoned for a year before she is due to stand trial for crimes against humanity. However, during protests outside her trial, she is seemingly shot dead and taken to a hospital. However it is later revealed her capture was organized by Nathan Bates, owner of a large scientific institution, who offers her a deal; life, food and shelter if she shares Visitor knowledge with him. However she quickly escapes and is able to contact the Visitor fleet, who have been hiding behind Earth's moon in preparation for a second invasion. Diana immediately takes command of the fleet from chief security officer Lydia and leads the second invasion against Earth. As Chief Science Officer of the fleet, Diana is a pioneer of the conversion process, a brainwashing technique used to turn humans to aid the Visitors, although it is not always effective. She has inoculated the Visitors against all known Earth diseases and has developed a fullproof truth drug. Steven and Pamela see her as \\"on edge\\" when feeling threatened, when Father Andrew shows her a bible, it makes Diana realise she has vulnerabilities, which she sees as a weakness, she responds by murdering the priest and destroying his bible. Her vengefulness is also displayed when she rejects John's pragmatic approach towards an impending defeat by murdering him. Diana, also being stunningly beautiful has several lovers in V: The Original Miniseries, V: The Final Battle and V: The Series; she is seen as using her sexuality and feminine wiles to have her way with men in order to elevate her position. Additionally, she repeatedly appears to attempt to seduce Christine Walsh, in order to manipulate her as the Visitors' spokesperson, suggesting Diana is bisexual. She was even involved with the Leader of the Visitors, prior to their arrival on Earth with Pamela suggesting that sex is \\"far too fragile a foundation\\" to handle Diana's ambition. Diana finds most of the men she is involved with disposable, killing one of them so she can blame him for misinforming the Leader and repeatedly reminding Lt. James she can find any other man to alleviate her boredom if he doesn't do as she commands. (In the V novels, it is said that Diana has an insatiable appetite for sex with humans - of both genders.) In V: The Series, she was forced to marry Charles, whom she cannot bear for promoting Lydia ahead of her, before a botched assassination attempt by Lydia against Diana resulted in his death, for which Diana and Lydia framed Marta. Diana is obsessed with capturing Elizabeth, or creating a new hybrid through cloning or other methods. She distrusts Lydia and tried several times to either kill Lydia or one of Lydia's close family members. When last seen, Diana has been placed under arrest by Philip, who does not know that Diana secretly planted a bomb on board the Leader's shuttle. Diana is considered the main breakout character of all three series of V. In August 2010, ABC confirmed that Jane Badler would join their remake of V, playing a new character also called Diana, who is the mother of the series' chief villain Anna. Badler later admitted that despite her prominence in the original series, she had to audition once more and eventually landed the part of Anna's mother, Diana, who has been imprisoned by Anna for 15 years because she believes that Diana's embrace of human emotion was a side effect of being \\"infected\\" by her human skin, and that such teachings represent a threat to her leadership. Her first appearance in the new series was in the last scene of the of the second season-opener \\"Red Rain.\\" In the series finale, \\"Mother's Day\\", Diana is killed by Anna after she is broken free from prison and tries to convince her people that the human soul is a gift. =Lydia= Lydia (June Chadwick) is introduced in V: The Series. Blonde and English-accented, she is commander of the fleet when Diana isn't in charge. After the Visitor home world became a barren wasteland, Lydia, the fleet security officer at the time, was promoted by the Leader himself and ordered to lead the fleet to Earth to commence the second invasion. At the same time Diana escaped and immediately took command of the fleet causing some resentment. She is as power-hungry as Diana, but far less sadistic. Lydia tends to inform on Diana's exploits to The Leader and overseers such as Philip and Charles. Lydia finds Diana belligerent and defiant, ignoring rules and procedure. Finally when she tortures Jacob, a pacifist man decorated by the Leader, Lydia decides to report Diana to the Leader personally, however Diana blows up her shuttle. It is later revealed that Lydia suspected foul play on Diana's part and that the shuttle she destroyed was a decoy. She returns to the mothership with Charles, a Supreme Commander who takes charge of the Invasion and Lydia becomes his adjutant. She later falls in love with Charles and experiences extreme jealousy when he decides to marry Diana. She fills Diana's cup with poison but to her dismay, Charles drinks the poison instead and Lydia only narrowly escapes, with Diana's assistance, of being convicted of killing him. She is forced to help Diana to frame Marta for Charles' death. Lydia's exact loyalties are unknown. She claims to serve only the Leader, however she also acts in her own best interests most likely to advance her own position or to get rid of Diana, however she lacks the cunning ruthlessness that Diana possesses and despises her manipulative tactics to maintain power. As Diana once told her, \\"I take charge of the situation and you wait for permission\\". Lydia is also an accomplished fighter, as she once defeated Diana in hand-to-hand combat. When the Leader declares an armistice, Lydia befriends the Resistance members and takes quite a delight in Diana's arrest. Officers=Brian= Brian (Peter Nelson) is introduced in V. A young Visitor officer who becomes a leader of the Friends of the Visitors youth corps. As Daniel Bernstein continues to prove his devotion and loyalty, he becomes Brian's second-in-command. Brian befriends Robin Maxwell, and when she becomes a prisoner on the mother ship. Diana enlists him in an experiment in inter-species reproduction. Daniel is set up to be seen by the Visitors as Brian's betrayer when Brian is captured and used as a test subject for the red dust. As he tries to manipulate Robin into setting him free by trying to appeal to her \\"love\\" for him, a vengeful Robin uses the Red Dust on Brian right after showing Brian their child, Elizabeth. =Jake= Jake (Stack Pierce) is introduced in V. He has the rank of Captain and the outward appearance of an African-American man. His unit captures both Robin and Robert Maxwell when they emerge from the downtown Resistance hideaway after curfew. He extracts the location of the mountain camp from Robert, but betrays Robert by leading an attack on the camp anyway, with Diana riding along. Jake is still serving in Diana's command a year later. =James= James (Judson Scott) is introduced in V: The Series. Lieutenant James is an opportunistic soldier and one of Diana's lovers. He is assigned to capture and destroy Resistance fighters no matter what the cost. He is loyal to Diana (though still always in fear of his life). He arranges an unsuccessful assassination attempt on The Leader and is last seen in custody alongside Diana. =Steven= Steven (Andrew Prine) is introduced in V. He is the security chief on board Diana's ship in Los Angeles. He establishes a relationship with Eleanor Dupres that he puts to use by bringing her into the fold as a collaborator and obtains information he feels is useful to his job. He engages in a power struggle with Diana. They differ in how they wish to handle the unexpected resilience of the Resistance. Steven apparently kills Eleanor when she attempts to flee the Visitor embassy and he is killed by Ham Tyler - who dumps a mass of red dust on Steven's face and leaves him to die. =Martin= Martin (Frank Ashmore) is a shuttle pilot who befriends Mike Donovan and his son, Sean. After the Visitors begin their reign of terror and Donovan is captured, Martin helps him escape. After Sean and his ex-wife Marjorie go missing ‚Äî along with the majority of the townspeople ‚Äî he goes up to the mothership again and confronts Martin about what the Visitors are really up to. He confesses that they've been stealing Earth's water supply, and that both Sean and Marjorie are alive. Unfortunately, he adds, they are being kept in suspended animation because, in addition to water, their planet also has another major shortage ‚Äî food. Martin is opposed to the Leader's plans, but is afraid to offer Donovan any more than ancillary support, as the Fifth Column is not strong enough to exist openly. Much later, the Visitors use Sean to trade for Donovan. Once aboard Diana's mothership, she immediately tests out her new truth serum on him. Unable to resist, Donovan unwillingly names Martin as the head of the Fifth Column aboard her vessel. Martin manages to kill Diana's guard, but she gets away. With nowhere left to turn, he follows Donovan back to Earth where he joins other members of the Fifth column. Following the end of the war and Diana's capture, Martin becomes Donovan's cameraman. However, his sense of outrage that Diana will be tried at the Hague instead of executed outright gets the better of him, and he tracks her down, hoping to do the job himself. Unfortunately, Diana mortally wounds him, escaping with his last Red Dust pill and setting her jail on fire. Donovan arrives too late to save his friend. =Phillip= Inspector General Phillip (Frank Ashmore) was introduced in the second half of V: The Series. He came to investigate Lydia's reports of Diana's behavior and to find Mike Donovan, the man who supposedly murdered his twin brother, Martin. However, after confronting Donovan, he discovers that it was Diana who was Martin's killer. Eventually, he becomes friends with Donovan as well, and becomes a valuable ally of the Resistance. (It is never explained how Phillip is immediately recognizable as Martin's brother, as both characters are always seen wearing their human disguises.) Cadets=Angela= Angela (Leslie Bevis) is introduced in V: The Series. A Visitor cadet, she killed another cadet during combat training and was dismissed by Philip for her sadism, thus preventing her from becoming an officer. Diana plays on Angela's resentment, assigning her as Philip's bodyguard on an assignment to capture Mike Donovan as part of her plan to have Philip killed. Angela is stopped from killing Philip when she is shot dead by Glenda. =Daniel= Daniel (Robert Thaler) is introduced in V: The Series. He is a young officer who becomes Diana's lover. After the failure of one of her exploits, Diana kills him \\"because someone has to take the blame\\". Due to the episodes being aired out of order, the episode in which Daniel dies aired before the episode in which he was introduced. =John Langley= John Langley (Bruce Davison) is introduced in V: The Series. He is the undercover agent assigned to infiltrate the Resistance and impregnate Robin Maxwell in hopes of creating a second Star Child, but he is killed by a Fifth Columnist before he can finish his mission. =Marta= Marta (Gela Nash) is introduced in V: The Series. She is the mother ship's pharmacist. She provided Lydia with the cat poison Lydia tried to use to kill Diana, but which killed Charles. Diana despises her and, with Lydia's reluctant assistance, frames her for Charles' murder. Marta is sentenced to be shot into space for eternity alongside Charles' decaying corpse in a space crypt. Diana orders Oswald to ensure that Marta is alive and conscious (\\"if she stops breathing so do you\\"); Marta wakes up next to the corpse just before the crypt leaves the ceremony site. =Nigel= Nigel (Ken Olandt) is introduced in V: The Series. Lydia's brother, he is brought to the Los Angeles Mothership as part of a scheme by Diana, who intends to have him sacrificed at a Visitor ceremony, but is thwarted by his sister and Philip. =Oswald= Oswald (Peter Elbling) is introduced in V: The Series. An underling of Diana, he is a mortician and an interior decorator. Diana had him \\"procure\\" several sexual partners for her pleasure (a job which he enjoyed immensely). He is very flamboyant and very openly homosexual but steered clear of what he considered stereotypical gay behavior such as \\"bathhousing and barbarism\\", though this did not stop him from indulging in his taste for sexual pleasures in much the same manner as Diana. He favored human partners, as well as a host of unknown male Visitors, considering sex a type of art to be practiced. =Willie= Willie (Robert Englund) was introduced in the first miniseries. He was a worker assigned to Arthur Dupres' chemical plant in Los Angeles. At first he had trouble adjusting to his new assignment (according to the novelization, his original name was Ahmed) and he had originally learned Arabic because he had been assigned to Saudi Arabia, and his human supervisor, Caleb Taylor, disliked him immensely. That changed once Willie rescued him after a liquid hydrogen pipe burst. Willie befriended a human, Harmony Moore, who helped him learn English. Unfortunately, she was killed during the Resistance's assault on Diana's ship. Following the end of the war, Willie settled down and worked as a waiter at Elias Taylor's restaurant, Club Creole, and served as mentor to Elizabeth Maxwell, the Starchild. Visitors aboard other motherships=Mary Kruger= Mary (Sybil Danning) is introduced in V: The Series. A Dallas-based Visitor, Mary attends a convention in Los Angeles to display the Encapsulator, a device of her own invention that will revolutionize the way in which humans are harvested for food. The resistance succeeds in blowing up the house in which the convention is being held, destroying the Encapsulator. Mary is killed in the explosion. 2009 version In the 2009 reimagining of V, the Visitors actually infiltrated governments around the world prior to their official appearance, and instigated most of the wars in the late 20th century to make them appear as saviors to humanity. Their technology has also advanced to the point of allowing them to simultaneously telecast to the entire world via the motherships in every known Earth language. Unlike the original series, in which the Visitors' human \\"skin\\" was a latex-like material that could be easily ripped off without much pain, these Visitors wear cloned human skin which is grafted onto their own skin. Damage of the skin is painful. Indeed, they have a high threshold for pain, and the only effective way to torture them is to skin them, which is ultimately lethal. They also practice sexual cannibalism as seen in Anna's case, who devours her mate after copulation. The Visitors' reproductive ability of egg-laying is retained in this series, although the egg sacks laid by Anna appear more womb-like, gestating in liquid substances than those having shells like normal reptiles. Analogous to a queen bee in a hive, Anna is able to spawn hundreds, possibly thousands of fertilzed eggs after a single act of copulation with a male Visitor. The eggs then gestate in tanks, growing until ready to hatch. Additionally, the type of male Visitor chosen to mate with the Queen will determine the type of Visitors that are bred. For example, if the Queen mates with a soldier Visitor, she will spawn soldier eggs (this creating a potential army). Various other Visitor types are seen based on their biological attributes, such as hunters, scientists, etc. The Queen is also able to lay a \\"Queen egg\\", which will become the next Queen once the current Queen is no longer fertile, thus perpetuating the species. * Anna (Morena Baccarin) is the Supreme Commander and Queen of the Visitors, an amalgam of the Diana, John, and \\"Leader\\" characters from the original series. She is intent on maintaining the Visitors' positive public image by any means. Anna appears to be the leader of the Visitor race as a whole (she is referred to by her own people as \\"the queen\\"). She maintains control of the Visitors by means of a psychic projection called \\"bliss\\", which seems to project the following when needed: a sense of euphoria, a calming effect whenever worry is prevalent, and generally seems to keep the Visitors in line. Fifth Columnists and other Visitors who exhibit human emotion seem resistant to the bliss. Anna regards human emotions as an aberration that must be purged from the Visitors, and is shocked when she begins to exhibit them herself. For this same reason, she has imprisoned her mother Diana (Jane Badler) in the bowels of her mothership for over 15 years. She also engages in sexual cannibalism when she mates with her subjects, whom are obligated to remain still as she lies atop them carrying out the act for them, much to their torment. In the final episode of the series, \\"Mother's Day\\", she kills Diana and banishes Lisa to her grandmother's prison for assisting her in her failed coup attempt. Also, for reasons unknown, she laid the last queen egg that later hatched into the Lisa clone that mated and killed Tyler. (see above) *Marcus (Christopher Shyer) is Anna's second-in-command. He often expresses dissatisfaction with some Anna's more draconian methods, but otherwise appears totally loyal. In the season one finale he revives Joshua, a Fifth Column member, leaving his loyalty apparently unknown, but it is then revealed that Joshua is revived to investigate who are his Fifth Column Partners. In season two, it is revealed that Marcus is loyal to Diana and he helps stage the coup d'√©tat on Anna. After its failure, he reveals to Anna his betrayal and Anna forgives him. *Joshua (Mark Hildreth) is Anna's chief medical advisor and head of the medical staff. He appears loyal to Anna at first but is soon revealed to be Fifth Column when he kills Dale Maddox; a V sleeper agent who was almost killed by Erica. Joshua later aids the Fifth Column on the ground via a communication device previously owned by John May, he provides key intel to Ryan and the others thanks to his close position to Anna. In the season 1 finale he is forced to reveal his allegiance in order to create a distraction for Erica to destroy Anna's eggs. He then allows Erica to kill him so she is not revealed as Fifth Column also. He is revived by Marcus in the closing minutes of Season 1. After being revived, his memory is wiped and he again appears loyal to Anna. However, after seeing Lisa sneaking around the mothership with Blue Energy, his memory returns and again he turns to the Fifth Column. * Lisa (Laura Vandervoort) is a young Visitor who is Anna's daughter, serving as officer in the Peace Ambassador Program which Tyler Evans joins after meeting her. Over the course of several episodes, her relationship with Tyler develops to the point where she begins experiencing human emotion and developing sympathies towards the Fifth Column. She is imprisoned after assisting her grandmother Diana in a failed coup attempt, while her clone mates with and devours Tyler. * Dale Maddox (Alan Tudyk) is a Visitor sleeper agent who poses as a FBI investigator working alongside Erica Evans. As a result, whenever she comes too close to Visitor activity, Dale contacts them to remove any trace. However, Erica learns the truth as she appears to have killed Dale during an assault on an anti-Visitor meeting in the pilot episode. Dale survives but is killed by the New York mothership's chief medical officer Joshua (Mark Hildreth), who is actually a Fifth Column agent.

Kwabena Nketia, Klaus Wachsmann, and Roy Travis. He held a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from the University of Ghana, Legon (1974). While at Legon, Euba's doctoral work was supervised by Professor Nketia, and his dissertation is entitled \\"Dundun Music of the Yoruba\\". Euba was professor and director of the Centre for Cultural Studies at the University of Lagos, and also served as a senior research fellow at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in Nigeria. He served as head of music at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation for five years. He was a research scholar and artist in residence at IWALEWA House, the African studies center of the University of Bayreuth in Germany between 1986 and 1992.

He organized regular symposia on music in Africa and the Diaspora at Churchill College, Cambridge as well as the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. These events featured such notable composers and scholars as J. H. Kwabena Nketia and Halim El-Dabh. With his Elekoto Ensemble, he brought together musicians from Nigeria, China, India, Germany, Malta, and the United States. His compositions involve a synthesis of African traditional material (often from his own ethnic group, the Yoruba people) and contemporary classical music. His most ambitious composition is the opera Chaka: An Opera in Two Chants (1970), which blends West African percussion and atenteben flutes with twelve-tone technique.

This is Shatner's first Trek collaboration. The audio adaptation of the book is notable as the first time in the entire Star Trek franchise that the famous phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" is uttered in that form. Plot summary The novel opens with Ambassador Spock on planet Veridian III following the events of Star Trek Generations. He is standing at the site where Captain Jean-Luc Picard had buried Captain James T. Kirk, paying final respects to his fallen friend. The story then flashes back six months before Kirk was believed to have been 'killed' on the maiden voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-B. Kirk is having trouble coping with retirement on Earth as the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-A is decommissioned for war games. Kirk is having difficulties finding ways to spend his spare time and finds it distasteful that Starfleet cadets are using holodeck simulations of his 'adventures' in training, insisting \\"they were just my job.\\" Kirk later attends a party at Starfleet Headquarters with his old friends Spock and 'Bones' McCoy, where they are disappointed to learn that the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief has been awarded to Admiral Androvar Drake (a former colleague of Kirk who has no qualms about cruelly mocking him). Kirk spots a mysterious young alien woman at the party, but doesn't get a chance to talk to her. Meanwhile, Chekov and Uhura are working undercover with a Starfleet Intelligence operative named Jade in Klingon territory. When Jade manages to obtain some information about something called the \\"Chalchaj 'Qmey\\", she betrays Chekov and Uhura, leaving them to die in a shuttle bay. Luckily, they are rescued by Sulu aboard the Excelsior (who have been secretly monitoring them during their mission) and, feeling they can no longer trust Starfleet Intelligence, return to Earth to report to Drake. Kirk returns to his parents' farm in Iowa, which he intends to sell soon. He is surprised to be reunited with the woman from the party, who gives her name as Teilani and explains that her world needs a hero. Suddenly, they are attacked and Teilani is shot. Kirk and Teilani manage to defeat and apparently kill their attackers, who Teilani explains are anarchists disrupting the peace of her homeworld. This world is called Chal and was originally colonized by both Klingons and Romulans (the inhabitants are all Klingon/Romulan hybrids), but both empires have now abandoned them. Chal apparently has fountain of youth properties, which seem proven when Teilani's wound miraculously heals, and the anarchists want to sell it. Kirk accepts Teilani's offer to help protect Chal, seeing it as a second chance. Despite protests from Spock and Bones, Kirk resigns from Starfleet and goes to Chal aboard the Enterprise, which Teilani got from the Federation as a 'goodwill gesture', being reunited with Scotty. When Sulu and the others report to Drake, he informs them about Kirk's resignation. The Chalchaj 'Qmey is believed to be some kind of doomsday weapon and Drake warns that there is a conspiracy within Starfleet trying to undermine peace talks with the Klingon Empire. Kirk and the Enterprise may be intended to help use this weapon against the Federation, so the group (now joined by Spock and Bones) are dispatched to find Chal and the weapon. After they leave, it is revealed that 'Jade' is actually Drake's daughter Ariadne, and that Drake is manipulating Kirk, his former crew and Teilani to get the Chalchaj 'Qmey for himself. Kirk arrives on Chal and quickly learns why its name is Klingon for 'heaven' - he starts feeling younger and more alive. The anarchists attack the power station in the center of Chal's only city and Teilani reveals that they are the older generation of her people - her group are fighting their own parents. Scotty puts down the attack from orbit, but starts to question the morality of the situation, so Kirk tells him about Chal's rejuvenation powers. However, Scotty does not believe him, leaving Kirk wondering if his revitalization and love for Teilani is just him denying his age. Later that night, Kirk leads a raid on the anarchists' camp and, having somehow survived being shot at point-blank range, takes a prisoner to the Enterprise brig for questioning. The prisoner, named Torl, explains that the people themselves are the Chalchaj 'Qmey, the 'Children of Heaven', and that the anarchists want to destroy their world's legacy, not sell it. Torl is shot dead by Teilani before he can tell Kirk more. Kirk realizes that things aren't how they seemed and confronts Teilani. The 'attackers' from the farm actually work for Teilani (they stopped their hearts to fake death) and Teilani faked her wound. She also secretly equipped Kirk with a force field emitter to prevent him being shot. Kirk declares he only came to Chal for the challenge of saving a world and he is not in love with Teilani, breaking her heart. They are suddenly called to the Enterprise as the Excelsior (now joined by Drake and a Klingon escort) arrives in orbit. Despite being equipped with only outdated Klingon disruptors (Starfleet stripped down the Enterprise prior to giving it to Chal) Kirk engages and manages to destroy one of the Klingon ships, causing Drake to angrily order the destruction of Kirk's ship. However, Kirk and his former crew agree that Drake's orders are against Starfleet protocol and the Excelsior withdraws for a general inquiry. Kirk and Teilani transport to the power station to find out the true secret of Chal. Lights and information displays are activated by Teilani's life signs, revealing that the power station actually contains weapons and that the Chalchaj 'Qmey were genetically created from not only Klingons and Romulans, but also stolen human tissue samples. Teilani is horrified, believing her people are little more than weapons themselves, but Kirk (who is shocked by a display depicting monstrous Starfleet agents brutally murdering Klingons and Romulans), discovers that they were actually created to be able to survive the contaminated environments the two empires believed would become the norm if the Federation conquered them. He comforts Teilani, assuring her that no-one can be held responsible for the world they are born into and that the important thing is to work to make the future better. Ariadne suddenly transports in, revealing that she and her father hope to make use of the Chalchaj 'Qmey by using them as living donor banks, using transplants from them to make immortality available to the Federation. She also tries to turn Teilani against Kirk, telling her that Kirk only came to Chal to gain immortality, but Kirk (who insists that his 'rejuvenation' was all in his mind) convinces Teilani to stop her heart. This puts the lights out, allowing Kirk to steal Ariadne's gun and use it to destroy the items and information so it can never fall into the wrong hands. Drake then arrives, explaining his intent to secure the future of the Federation by provoking them into all-out war with the Klingon Empire and devastating the latter. Refusing to accept Drake's vision of the future, Kirk and Teilani transport back to the Enterprise and are surprised to find all the old crew there awaiting Kirk's orders (having figured out Drake is the true head of the 'conspiracy'). Drake returns to the remaining Klingon ship, but instead of engaging in a fair fight orders it into a slingshot maneuver around Chal's sun, hoping to go back in time and destroy Kirk the day he arrived. With Sulu at the helm, the Enterprise manages to prevent this, but both ships get trapped in the sun. Drake refuses to attempt escape until Kirk is dead, gleefully watching as the Enterprise explodes. However, Kirk and the others actually survived by transporting to the Excelsior at the last minute. Kirk advises Drake to drop his ship's shields so he and his crew can be saved, but Drake refuses and his ship is destroyed as they try to escape. Teilani is confused, noting that Drake believed Kirk and wondering why he refused help. Kirk explains \\"He was once a starship captain. And starship captains believe they're invincible . . . they have to be. It's their job.\\" Kirk visits Chal one last time, giving Teilani the Enterprise's dedication plaque (which he had ripped off the wall of the exploding bridge prior to its destruction) for safekeeping and advising her to tell her children about him. Back in Federation space, Kirk, Spock and Bones watch the construction of a new Enterprise and note how Drake's position will probably now be offered to Kirk. Kirk laughs at this, insisting that the adventure they've just had is proof he's not suitable. Bones reminds Kirk of how he's a living legend and how simulations of his adventures will be seen by Starfleet cadets for centuries to come. Kirk comments \\"I only hope they enjoy those adventures as much as I did\\", realizing that this way, he really will live forever. The novel then flashes 80 years into the future. Spock is still at Kirk's gravesite when the bright flash of phaser fire illuminates the night sky directly above him, where the U.S.S. Farragut is orbiting the planet, leading salvage operations of the crashed remains of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. One stream of phaser fire is consistent with starfleet-type weaponry, and the other is green, clearly alien in origin. Spock conjectures that the Farragut is engaged in combat. Suddenly a strong gust of wind envelops the gravesite, and Spock hears the unmistakable sound of a transporter beam activating, as Kirk's grave glows through the rocks from within. The grave then collapses in on itself, and the gust of wind stops. Spock looks up towards the stars, unsure of what has just transpired, or why. Characters * James T.

He was asking about whether they would be interested in collaborating with William Shatner on a new book. Shatner had just completed filming as James T. Kirk on the film Star Trek Generations which showed the death of his character. Both Shatner and Pocket Books wanted the character's story to continue in novel form. The novel was set immediately prior to the events of Generations. After the trio submitted the manuscript to Pocket Books, the response was positive and wanted to know if a sequel was possible. Comics DC Comics published a one-shot graphic novel adaptation of this novel in 1995, with writing credit of William Shatner with Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens.

Located approximately northwest of downtown Los Angeles, it is one of four jails located within the Pitchess Detention Center (named after former Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess), in Castaic, California. The facility's construction began in 1985, and it was formally dedicated on March 1, 1990 by then Sheriff, Sherman Block, and the President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. NCCF consists of five jails within the same facility, and it has an inmate population of about 3,800. It can provide for disciplinary segregation and clinic-level medical treatment. The facility is commonly referred to as the \\"Flagship\\"; it was designed and constructed to be cost-efficient with regard to the ratio of staff members to inmates and vocational productivity. NCCF has a ratio of ten inmates to each staff member. The facility features educational, vocational and counseling programs. These programs have been designed to assist the facility's inmates in becoming self-sufficient within the law.  2006 riot  On Saturday, February 4, 2006, a prison riot at the facility injured over 100 inmates. Nine inmates were critically injured, and eight had minor injuries. One inmate was pronounced dead at the scene. Numerous ambulances were summoned to the remote facility after fighting began and custody personnel deployed tear gas to quell the disturbance. No law enforcement personnel were injured in the riot. According to deputies, the four-hour riot was sparked by racial tensions generated outside the prison between Mexican and African-American gang members. In retribution for a conflict between these gangs and in a show of the reach of their power, Mexican gang leaders had successfully ordered Mexican prisoners within the NCCF compound to drop furniture items from several stories above onto unsuspecting African-American prisoners below, with whom they had no personal differences. On Wednesday, April 28, 2010, two inmates, Jose Baldeno and Winder Barrios, were discovered missing during a 3:15 a.m. headcount. The two were captured several hours later.

Both ends are needle-like, but raphides tend to be blunt at one end and sharp at the other.  Calcium oxalate in plants  Raphides in Hypoestes phyllostachya, the polka dot plant Many plants accumulate calcium oxalate crystals in response to surplus calcium, which is found throughout the natural environment. The crystals are produced in an intriguing variety of shapes. The crystal morphology depends on the taxonomic group of the plant. In one study of over 100 species, it was found that calcium oxalate accounted for 6.3% of plant dry weight. Crystal morphology and the distribution of raphides (in roots or leaves or tubers etc.) is similar in some taxa but different in others leaving possible opportunities for plant key characteristics and systematic identification; mucilage in raphide containing cells makes light microscopy difficult, though. Little is known about the mechanisms of sequestration or indeed the reason for accumulation of raphides but it is most likely as a defense mechanism against herbivory. It has also been suggested that in some cases raphides may help form plant skeletal structure. Raphides typically occur in parenchyma cells in aerial organs especially the leaves, and are generally confined to the mesophyll. As the leaf area increases, so does the number of raphides, the process starting in even young leaves. The first indications that the cell will contain crystals is shown when the cells enlarge with a larger nucleus. Raphides are found in specialized plant cells or crystal chambers called idioblasts. Also, Electron micrographs have shown that raphide needle crystals are normally four sided or H-shaped (with a groove down both sides) or with a hexagonal cross section and some are barbed. Wattendorf (1976) suggested that all circular sectioned raphides, as visible in a light microscope, are probably hexagonal in cross section The hexagonal crystals reported by Wattendorf in Agave americana were apparently calcium oxalate.According to this abstract in the FDA Poisonous Plant Database Agave americana contains calcium oxalate crystals, acrid oils, saponins, and other compounds. Microscopy using polarized light shows bright opalescence with raphides. Plants like Tradescantia pallida also accumulate calcium oxalate crystals in response to heavy metals stress.  Harmful effects  Raphides can produce severe toxic reactions by facilitating the passage of toxin through the herbivore's skin when the tissue containing the raphides also contains toxins. The lethal dose to mice is around 15 mg/kg. Raphides seem to be a defense mechanism against plant predators, as they are likely to tear and harm the soft tissues of the throat or esophagus of a plant predator chewing on the plant's leaves. The venomous process is in two stages: mechanical pricking and injection of harmful protease. Typically ingestion of plants containing raphides, like those common in certain houseplants, can cause immediate numbing followed shortly by painful edema, vesicle formation and dysphagia accompanied by painful stinging and burning to the mouth and throat with symptoms occurring for up to two weeks. Airway assessment and management are of the highest priority, as are extensive irrigation and analgesics in eye exposure. Raphides cannot normally be destroyed by boiling; that requires an acidic environment or chemical solvents like ether. Plants containing large amounts of raphides are generally acrid and unpalatable. However, it is not always possible to detect the presence of raphides through taste alone. In some tubers such as Indian turnip which contain large quantities of raphides, the roots are not unpalatable when cooked because the raphides are bound within a matrix of starch which prevents the tongue from sensing their presence. Some other plants store raphides in mucilaginous environments and also do not taste acrid.  Plants containing raphides  Common names vary. The following list is incomplete. Raphides are found in many species in the families Araceae and Commelinaceae, but are also found in a few species in a number of other families.

The largest prize given at the Spanish Christmas Lottery (and to a lesser extent at any other Spanish lottery), is also referred to as 'El Gordo'.  How it is played  Tickets consist of two grids, one with numbers from 1 to 54 and the second from 0 to 9. Players have to pick five numbers in the first grid and one in the second (key number). The key number also serves as return number. The tickets can be bought from Monday to Saturday in over eleven thousand locations in Spain and cost ‚Ç¨1.50 per grid. By selecting six to eleven numbers in the first grid you can make multiple (6 to 462) bets with the same ticket.  Drawing  Drawings are held every Sunday at 13:00 (GMT+1). Five numbers are drawn at random from 1-54, and then another one for the key number from 0-9. Prizes are awarded to tickets whose numbers match the drawn ones. First prize is for a perfect match (5+1), second for 5+0, third for 4+1, and so on until 2+0, totaling 8 prize categories. Tickets whose key number matches the drawn key number are entitled to a refund of the amount played. A ticket can hold more than one bet, but each bet cannot win more than one prize.  Prizes  From the total amount collected T, the state keeps 45%. 10% is reserved for returns (refunds), and 45% is distributed on prizes (22% for first category, and 23% for the rest of prizes). For all categories, the prize is shared in equal parts among all matching tickets. First category has a guaranteed minimum amount of five million euros. In the case of no first category winners, 50% of the amount reserved for the first category (11% of T) is accumulated to the guaranteed (or previous) amount for the next drawing, often leading to huge bonus prizes (just for the first category). The amount for the rest of prizes (23% of T) is then reduced by the number of tickets with 2+0 prizes (eighth category), each of which receive a fixed amount of 3 ‚Ç¨. The resulting amount R is then distributed like this: * 33% of R for second category (5+0) * 6% of R for third category (4+1) * 7% of R for fourth category (4+0) * 8% of R for fifth category (3+1) * 26% of R for sixth category (3+0) * 20% of R for seventh category (2+1) Special rules apply in case any of these categories remains void, and also in case any category were to have lower prizes than a lower one.

Yardley was also the oldest living member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was born in Newark, New Jersey. Chittick was a graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and was the first person to attend his 90th reunion in the school's 230-year history. While a student he got into a scuffle with fellow student and future actor Humphrey Bogart after he refused to polish Bogart's shoes. After Andover, Chittick went to MIT, where he majored in mechanical engineering, was a low-hurdle track champion, and a member of the Beta Theta Pifraternity. While a student at MIT, he was elected captain of the one-mile relay track team. Chittick was once offered a job by Thomas Edison but turned it down, saying he thought it would be more fun to work for the Kroydon Company, a golf club manufacturer. He said Edison gave him a 150-question test before offering him the job. Several years before his death, he said he asked for a copy of the test from the Thomas Edison Museum and was shown the original with Edison's handwriting in the margins. Chittick became registered as a patent attorney on February 1, 1934. He was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court on September 20, 1950. He was married twice and had two sons. His first marriage ended in divorce, which involved a lawsuit that went to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court based on a dispute over a complex settlement and the validity of a divorce filed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Chittick was the first recipient of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity's Beta Centenarian award in 2003. He attended the annual Beta Theta Pi conventions and was annually honored for his lifetime achievement, regularly taking the podium to sing the MIT fight song \\"Take Me Back to Tech\\". Until his death, Chittick lived at the Pleasant View Retirement Home in Concord, New Hampshire, near St. Paul's School. He made occasional appearances at the nearby Franklin Pierce Law Center, which is recognized for its strong patent program, and which awarded Chittick an honorary degree in 2005.

Academic career Enroth is a graduate of Houghton College and earned his M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Kentucky. He began his career in teaching sociology during his doctoral studies, and held the post of an instructor at Westmont College from 1965-67. He was appointed as an assistant professor (1967‚Äì71), and then associate professor (1971‚Äì76) at Westmont. He became a full professor in 1976. Although Enroth's doctoral work was in the field of medical sociology, he has pursued research and teaching in the sociology of religion, new religious movements, social problems, and the sociology of deviant behavior. He holds memberships within four professional organizations: American Sociological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, American Academy of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion. Enroth won the Leo J. Ryan commemorative award in 1982.Bio Sheet, Ronald M. Enroth, June 1, 1996.http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/provost/documents/Faculty_C_V/Enroth,%20Ron%20F2005.pdf He was the Social Science editor for the periodical the Christian Scholar's Review (1987‚Äì1990). He has also served on the editorial advisory board of the secular anti-cult movement periodical the Cultic Studies Journal. He also served for a number of years on the board of reference for the ministry the Spiritual Counterfeits Project in Berkeley, California. In 1987 he delivered the Tanner Annual Lecture at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. In 1994, Westmont College awarded Enroth twice for both Faculty Researcher of the Year and also Teacher of the Year in Social Sciences. Praise In general, Enroth's writings have been acknowledged in Christian circles as significant contributions on the subject of \\"cults\\". In 1992 J. Gordon Melton made special mention of Enroth as an important figure in the Christian countercult movement. Unlike most of the apologists who concentrate on doctrinal questions, Enroth is distinguished as one of the few writers in the movement to both hold credentials in sociology and to apply sociological tools in his analyses. Melton stated that Enroth was \\"the single most widely read of the Evangelical Christian counter-cult writers.\\" Melton, J.G. 1992. Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America: Garland Pub. JPUSA Controversy In 1993, Enroth's book Recovering from Churches That Abuse set off a \\"firestorm of debate among religious scholars,\\" centered around a chapter on the group Jesus People USA which included several stories of alleged abuse within the group. James T. Richardson, former president of the Association for the Sociology of Religion and currently Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies (University of Nevada, Reno), criticized Enroth's book and research methods in an issue of JPUSA's Cornerstone magazine, writing in part: > Enroth's book can be viewed as another in a long line of popular books that > teach people how to become good victims by reinterpreting their past. > Ironically, this thoroughly non-sociological book makes use of a > sociological truththat people are constantly reinterpreting their past to > make their view of that past more functional for their presentas he > delivers the message that people's problems are not really their fault. > Someone else is always to blame. This line of thought is controversial from > several perspectives, of course, including the theological and the > therapeutic. ... Enroth reminds the reader several times that he is a > sociologist, thus implying that he is doing sociology in the book, but this > slim volume is not sociological. There is no attempt to sample properly, or > to limit generalizations in any explicit way. There is no effort to discuss > the issue of self-serving accounts that plague all such books of this > 'anticult' bent, and there is a glossing over of the writer's own particular > religious persuasion. Furthermore, there is virtually no recognition of the > considerable scholarly research that might be used to counter the apparent > thesis of Enroth, who seems to believe that religious groups that require > heavy discipline and commitment should be avoided in favor of less demanding > mainstream groups. JPUSA elders, who attempted to convince Enroth to remove the chapter prior to the release of the book, referred to the chapter as \\"poison in the well.\\" Ruth Tucker, a professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School also defended JPUSA saying Enroth was \\"sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed.\\" In defense of Enroth's work, Paul R. Martin, the director of Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of cults and \\"abusive groups,\\" supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA \\"displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly authoritarian and totalistic groups.\\" Ronald Enroth himself responded to the controversy (some of which had occurred prior to the release of the book) in the book itself, in part with: > There has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church > and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have > questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, > and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy > hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than > forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports > of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling > to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the > leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who > have cooperated with my research efforts. As a result of the book's chapter on JPUSA, according to a later newspaper article, \\"scores\\" of members read it and decided to leave the group.

Plantation houses in the Southern United States and in other areas are known as quite grand and expensive architectural works today, though most were more utilitarian, working farmhouses. Antebellum American South In the American South, antebellum plantations were centered on a \\"plantation house,\\" the residence of the owner, where important business was conducted. Slavery and plantations had different characteristics in different regions of the South. As the Upper South of the Chesapeake Bay colonies developed first, historians of the antebellum South defined planters as those who held 20 enslaved people. Major planters held many more, especially in the Deep South as it developed.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, xiii The majority of slaveholders held 10 or fewer enslaved people, often to labor domestically. By the late 18th century, most planters in the Upper South had switched from exclusive tobacco cultivation to mixed-crop production, both because tobacco had exhausted the soil and because of changing markets. The shift away from tobacco meant they had slaves in excess of the number needed for labor, and they began to sell them in the internal slave trade. There was a variety of domestic architecture on plantations. The largest and wealthiest planter families, for instance, those with estates fronting on the James River in Virginia, constructed mansions in brick and Georgian style, e.g. Shirley Plantation. Common or smaller planters in the late 18th and 19th century had more modest wood frame buildings, such as Southall Plantation in Charles City County. Schriever, Louisiana, June 1940 In the Lowcountry of South Carolina, by contrast, even before the American Revolution, planters holding large rice plantations typically owned hundreds of enslaved people. In Charleston and Savannah, the elite also held numerous enslaved people to work as household servants. The 19th-century development of the Deep South for cotton cultivation depended on large plantations with much more acreage than was typical of the Upper South; and for labor, planters held hundreds of enslaved people. Until December 1865 slavery was legal in parts of the United States. Most enslaved people labored in agricultural production, and planter was a term commonly used to describe a farmer with many enslaved humans. The term planter has no universally-accepted definition, but academic historians have defined it to identify the elite class, \\"a landowning farmer of substantial means.\\" In the \\"Black Belt\\" counties of Alabama and Mississippi, the terms \\"planter\\" and \\"farmer\\" were often synonymous.Oakes, Ruling Race, 52. Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman define large planters as owning over 50 enslaved people, and medium planters as owning between 16 and 50 enslaved humans. In his study of Black Belt counties in Alabama, Jonathan Wiener defines planters by ownership of real property, rather than of enslaved people. A planter, for Wiener, owned at least $10,000 worth of real estate in 1850 and $32,000 worth in 1860, equivalent to about the top 8 percent of landowners. In his study of southwest Georgia, Lee Formwalt also defines planters in size of land holdings rather than enslaved people. Formwalt's planters are in the top 4.5 percent of land owners, translating into real estate worth $6,000 or more in 1850, $24,000 or more in 1860, and $11,000 or more in 1870. In his study of Harrison County, Texas, Randolph B. Campbell classifies large planters as owners of 20 enslaved humans, and small planters as owners of between ten and 19 enslaved humans. In Chicot and Phillips counties, Arkansas, Carl H. Moneyhon defines large planters as owners of twenty or more enslaved humans, and six hundred or more acres. Plantation house in the Southern United States The Palladian-inspired main house at Drayton Hall near Charleston, South Carolina, built in 1738. Its planned side- wings and linking arcades were executed but demolished in the late 19th century. Most historical research has focused on the main houses of plantations, primarily because they were the most likely to survive and usually the most elaborate structures in the complex. Also, until fairly recent times, scholars and local historians usually focused on the life of the plantation owner, that is, the planter, and his or her family rather than the people they held as slaves. All romanticized notions aside, the plantation house was, at its most basic, a functioning farmhouse. Although some plantation houses were planned as grand mansions and were built all at once from the ground up, many more began as fairly rudimentary structures that either stayed that way, were replaced, or were enlarged and improved over time as fortunes improved. In most areas of the South the earliest settlers constructed houses to provide basic shelter suited to their local climate, not to establish permanence or demonstrate wealth or power. Montpelier near Laurel, Maryland, built 1783. A Georgian-style mansion with Palladian-inspired side wings. Pleasant Prospect, built c. 1798 in Bowie, Maryland is an excellent example of the more restrained Federal style architecture that was popular following American independence. In colonial Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, the earliest plantation houses tended to follow British-derived folk forms such as the hall and parlor house-type and central-passage house-type. Grander structures during the later colonial period usually conformed to the neoclassically- influenced Georgian and Palladian styles, although some very early and rare Jacobean structures survive in Virginia. Following the Revolutionary War, Federal and Jeffersonian-type neoclassicism became dominant in formal plantation architecture. Large portions of the South outside of the original British colonies, such as in Kentucky and Tennessee, did not see extensive settlement until the early 1800s. Although large portions of Alabama and Mississippi were settled at roughly the same time, there were areas of these states, along with portions of western Georgia and southeastern Tennessee, that did not see wide-scale settlement until after the Indian removal in the 1830s. Very little formal architecture existed within these newly settled areas, with most dwellings being of hewn logs into the 1840s. The dogtrot-type plan was common for many of these log houses. Destrehan sugar plantation in Destrehan, Louisiana, built 1787‚Äì1790. Built in the French Colonial style, the original slender wooden gallery posts were replaced with monumental Doric columns when the Greek Revival-style was popular. Rough vernacular architecture for early plantations was also true in Arkansas and Missouri although in their river regions, and in the southern portion of what became the state of Louisiana, the plantations reflected French Colonial architectural types, often with Spanish influences, well after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Admitted to the Union in the mid-1840s, early architecture in Florida and Texas generally showed a stronger Spanish Colonial architectural influence, blended with French and British forms. Some of the wealthiest planters never built grand residences. One example was noted by Albert J. Pickett, an early Alabama historian. In 1850 he visited Nicholas Davis, the owner of the prosperous Walnut Grove Plantation. Despite owning more than 100 slaves, he was still living in the large log house he had built after his migration from Virginia in 1817. He told Pickett that he \\"would not exchange (it) for a palace.\\" Even Gaineswood, now a National Historic Landmark due to it being considered a lavish example of a plantation house, began as a two-story hewn-log dogtrot that was eventually enveloped within the brick mass of the house. Moss Hill near Pine Apple, Alabama, completed in 1845. An example of a simple I-house or Plantation Plain-style house. This folk house style, along with similarly proportioned log and frame houses, were once the most common types of plantation houses. After the period of initial settlement, more refined folk house types came from the older portions of the South, especially the I-house, thought by architectural scholars to be a descendant of the hall and parlor and the central-passage house-types. The central-passage house continued to be popular and could be either single-pile (one room deep) or double-pile (two rooms deep). If it had a porch, it was under a separate roof attached to the main house. I-houses were always two stories high, always single-pile, with side gables or a hipped roof. They were at least two rooms wide, with latter examples usually having a central hall dividing them. In the South, they usually had full-width one-story shed extensions to the front and rear. These sheds could manifest as open porches, enclosed rooms, or a combination of the two. This I-house with sheds came to be commonly referred to as \\"Plantation Plain.\\" It also proved to be one of the most adaptable folk house types to changing architectural tastes, with some even having neoclassical porticoes and other high-style elements added to them at a later date. Millford Plantation in South Carolina. Regarded as one of the finest examples of Greek Revival residential architecture in the United States.Jenrette, Richard Hampton (2005). with Old Houses, p. 179. Wyrick & Company. Another house type, the Creole cottage, came from the areas along the Gulf Coast and its associated rivers that were formerly part of New France. It was always one-and-a-half stories, with a side-gabled roof, and often had upper floor dormer windows. However, it accommodated a full-width front porch under the main roof, with doors or jib-windows opening from all of the rooms onto the porch, and was usually raised high above the ground on a full raised basement or piers. It was a common form for many early plantation houses and town houses alike in the lower reaches of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Gaineswood in Demopolis, Alabama, built from 1843 to 1861. Designed by its owner from pattern books, it is a Greek Revival with Italianate-influenced asymmetrical massing. When the cotton boom years began in the 1830s, the United States was entering its second neoclassical phase, with Greek Revival architecture being the dominant style. By this point trained architects were also becoming more common, and several introduced the style to the South. Whereas the earlier Federal and Jeffersonian neoclassicism displayed an almost feminine lightness, academic Greek Revival was very masculine, with a heaviness not seen in the earlier styles. Annandale Plantation in Mannsdale, Mississippi, built from 1857 to 1859. It replaced a log house that the family lived in for almost 20 years. Their new Italianate-style mansion was derived from plans published by Minard Lafever in 1856. It was destroyed by fire in 1924. Earlier neoclassicism had often used ancient Roman models and the Tuscan order, along with the Roman versions of the original three Greek orders. The original Greek orders were Doric, Ionic, and the Corinthian. The academic version of Greek Revival embraced the pure form of ancient Grecian architecture. Due to its popularity during a time of great wealth for many southern plantations, it was the Greek Revival that became permanently linked to the plantation legend. Though some houses were architect-designed, many, if not most, were designed by the owners or their carpenters from pattern books published by Asher Benjamin, Minard Lafever, John Haviland, and others. Greek Revival proved to very adaptable to the hot and humid climate of the South, with colloquial adaptations of the style seen from one region, and sometimes from one town, to another. Samuel Sloan-designed \\"Oriental Villa\\" mansion, Longwood, in Natchez, Mississippi. It was started in 1859 and never completed. Greek Revival would remain a favorite architectural style in the agrarian South until well after the Civil War, but other styles had appeared in the nation about the same time as Greek Revival or soon afterward. These were primarily the Italianate and Gothic Revival. They were slower to be adopted in whole for domestic plantation architecture, but they can be seen in a fusion of stylistic influences. Houses that were basically Greek Revival in character sprouted Italianate towers, bracketed eaves, or adopted the asymmetrical massing characteristic of that style. Although never as popular as Greek Revival, fully Gothic Revival and Italianate plantation houses began to appear by the 1850s, after being popularized by the books of men such as Alexander Jackson Davis, Andrew Jackson Downing, and Samuel Sloan. The Gothic Revival was usually expressed in wood as Carpenter Gothic. Italianate was the most popular of the two styles. It was also most commonly built using wood construction when used for plantation houses, although a few brick examples, such as Kenworthy Hall, have survived. The outbreak of war in 1861 put an abrupt end to the building of grand mansions. Following the war and the end of Reconstruction, the economy was drastically altered. Planters often did not have the funds for upkeep of their existing houses and new construction virtually ceased on most plantations. The new sharecropping method kept many plantations going, but the days of extravagance were over.

This province consisted of much of the Croatian region of Dalmatia and parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and was named for its coastal (maritime) location. The capital city of the Littoral Banovina was Split. Borders According to the 1931 Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, :The Littoral Banovina is bounded on the north by the southern boundaries already drawn of the Sava and Vrbas Banovinas as far as the intersection of the limits of the three districts of Jajce, Bugojno, and Travnik (Rakovce, hill 1217). From this point the boundary of the Banovina follows the eastern border of the district of Bugojno, then the northern boundary of the district of Konjic, to continue along the eastern boundary of the districts of Konjic and Mostar up to the intersection of the boundaries of the districts of Mostar, Stolac, and Nevesinje. It then continues along the eastern boundary of the district of Stolac, which it includes. On the Adriatic, the boundary of the Banovina passes through the Neretva and Pelje≈°ac channels to join the maritime frontier of the State. Map of the Littoral Banovina History In 1939, the Littoral Banovina was merged with the Sava Banovina and parts of neighboring provinces to create the Banovina of Croatia. In 1941, the World War II Axis Powers occupied the former area of the Littoral Banovina. Coastal areas from Split to Zadar were annexed by Fascist Italy with the remainder becoming a part of the Independent State of Croatia. Following World War II, the region was divided between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina within a federal Communist Yugoslavia.

He was one of the closest students of Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim) and a noted Talmid Chacham. In the interwar period, he served as rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Ohel Torah-Baranovich. Early life and education Elchonon Bunim Wasserman was born in 1874 in Bir≈æai (Birz) in present-day Lithuania to Naftali Beinish, a shopkeeper and Sheina Rakhel.Weekly Biography: Hagaon Harav Elchanan Wasserman Hy\\"d, Hamodia; 9 July 2008; pg. C3 In 1890, the family moved to Bauska (Boisk) in present-day Latvia, and Wasserman, then 15 years old, studied in the Telshe Yeshiva in Tel≈°iai (Telz) under Eliezer Gordon and Shimon Shkop. When Wasserman returned home during vacation, he participated in classes given by Abraham Isaac Kook, who was appointed rabbi of Bauska in 1895.Henkin, Eitam (September 22, 2016) \\"Rav Kook's Attitude Towards Keren Hayesod ‚Äì United Israel Appeal\\", The Seforim Blog. Retrieved November 19, 2019. In the summer of 1897, Wasserman met Chaim Soloveitchik at a health resort and \\"became deeply attached to him and his way of learning.\\" He left Telz and traveled to Brest-Litovsk (Brisk) in present-day Belarus, where he learned under Soloveitchik for two years, thereafter considering him his primary rebbe (teacher and mentor). Wasserman was married in 1899 to Michla, the daughter of Meir Atlas, rabbi of Salantai (Salant). Wasserman lived in his father-in-law's house for many years and rejected offers of rabbinical posts (including a prestigious rabbinate in Moscow) being afforded the opportunity to learn Torah at home. He did however decide to teach, and together with Yoel Baranchik, he started a mesivta (high school) in Mstislavl (known to Jews as Amtchislav) in 1903 and earned himself a reputation as an outstanding teacher. Prior to 1907, Wasserman heard that another local rabbi wanted to head the mesivta in Amtshilov and he left to avoid an argument, returning to learn in his father-in-law's house. From 1907 to 1910, he studied in the Kollel Kodshim in the Radu≈Ñ Yeshiva in Radun (Radin), headed by Yisrael Meir Kagan. While at the kollel, Wasserman studied for eighteen hours a day with Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, who would later become the rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Ponevezh Yeshiva. =Rosh yeshiva= In 1910, with the encouragement of Kagan, Wasserman was appointed rosh yeshiva of the mesivta in Brest-Litovsk, leading its expansion until it was disbanded in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I. With its closing, Wasserman returned to Kagan in Radin. When the Eastern Front reached Radin, however, the yeshiva there was closed, and Wasserman fled to Russia with Kagan. In 1914, the yeshiva was exiled to Smilavichy (Smilovichi near Minsk) and Wasserman was appointed its rosh yeshiva one year later when Kagan decided to relocate to Siemiatycze (Semiatitch). Together with Yitzchok Hirshowitz (son-in-law of Eliezer Gordon from Telz Yeshiva), Wasserman was asked to keep Torah alive in Smilavichy. In 1921, after the war, the Soviet government began permitting Torah scholars to leave Russia. Wasserman moved to Baranovichi, Second Polish Republic (now in Belarus), where he took the lead of Yeshiva Ohel Torah- Baranovich. The yeshiva grew under Wasserman's supervision, and soon had close to 300 students. Copies of notes taken from Wasserman's Torah lectures were passed around many of the yeshivas in Europe, increasing his influence and fame over most of the Torah world. He was one of the leaders of the Agudath Israel movement and was regarded as the spiritual successor of Kagan. When there was not enough money to buy food for the yeshiva students, Wasserman traveled to the United States to raise money for the yeshiva. He made an impression on many young Jews that he met while he was there. Wasserman returned to Poland, although he knew his life was in danger by doing so. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College, due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions. =Death in the Holocaust= Monument to the victims of the massacre at the Seventh Fort (July 1941) When World War II broke out, Wasserman fled to Vilnius (Vilna). In 1941, while on a visit to Kaunas (Kovno), he was arrested by Lithuanian Nazi sympathizers with twelve other rabbis and sent to his death. Wasserman was taken and murdered by Lithuanian collaborators on the 12th of Tammuz, 1941, in the Seventh Fort of Kaunas Fortress. Before he was taken he gave this statement: > \\"In Heaven it appears that they deem us to be righteous because our bodies > have been chosen to atone for the Jewish people. Therefore, we must repent > now, immediately. There is not much time. We must keep in mind that we will > be better offerings if we repent. In this way we will save the lives of our > brethren overseas. Let no thought enter our minds, God forbid, which is > abominable and which renders an offering unfit. We are now fulfilling the > greatest mitzvah. With fire she [Jerusalem] was destroyed and with fire she > will be rebuilt. The very fire which consumes our bodies will one day > rebuild the Jewish people\\". There was no monument,(matzeiva) just a marker to the pit where, with others, he was shot. Wasserman had discouraged emigration to the United States or Palestine, viewing them as places of spiritual danger. He was particularity critical of the Zionist enterprise in Palestine and claimed, \\"Anti-Semites want to kill the body, but Zionists kill the soul. Better to die than consort with the Zionists.\\" =Family= Wasserman had several sons. Simcha Elazar (1899-1992), his oldest, served as dean of Yeshiva Beth Yehudah in Detroit in the 1940s, founded Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon (later renamed Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon Chabad/West Coast Talmudical Seminary) in Los Angeles, California, in the 1950s, and later founded Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon in Jerusalem. Wasserman's son David survived the Holocaust, remarried and relocated to Brooklyn, NY.I Shall Lead You Through the Nights : the Holocaust Memoir of Eva Feldsztein Wasserman, OCLC #841806112 (Margate, NJ:2013), available at https://www.worldcat.org/title/i-shall-lead-you-through-the-nights-the- holocaust-memoir-of-eva-feldsztein-wasserman/oclc/841806112. Wasserman's other son Naftoli died in the Holocaust. Works Wasserman was famous for his clear, penetrating Talmudic analysis. His popular works, essential material in yeshivas around the world, are unique in their approach. He would often quote his rebbe, Chaim Soloveitchik, saying \\"Producing chiddushim (novel Torah concepts) is not for us. That was only in the power of the Rishonim. Our task is to understand what it says.\\" This approach is evident in his works, which include: *Kovetz Heoros *Kovetz Shiurim *Kovetz Biyurim *Kovetz Shemuos *Kovetz Inyanim *Kovetz Maamarim *Ikvasa Demeshicha Wasserman also published the responsa of the Rashba with annotations in 1932. His talmudic novellae appeared in the rabbinic journal Sha'arei Tzion (1929‚Äì1934) and in other publications.

Brown, Seth Penn Leet (1851-?), Reverend James Gordon Holdcroft , Marion Lawrence, Henry John Heinz, and Bishop Joseph Crane Hartzell in 1917 Joseph Crane Hartzell (1 June 1842 ‚Äì 6 September 1928) was an American Missionary Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church who served in the United States and in Africa. Early life and family Joseph was born of Methodist parents on a farm near Moline, Illinois. He was converted to the Christian faith as a boy. In 1863 he rescued four men from drowning in Lake Michigan and was honored by the City of Evanston, Illinois for his heroism. In 1869 Joseph married Miss Jennie Culver of Chicago. Joseph earned his own education, entering upon an eleven years' course of study at the age of sixteen. He earned a B.D. degree in 1868 from Garrett Biblical Institute. Prior to this, he had received a B.A. degree from Illinois Wesleyan University. Illinois Wesleyan and Allegheny College both granted him the honorary degree of D.D. in 1875. He taught school for a period of time in the early and mid-1860s, before entering the ministry. Ordained ministry The Rev. Hartzell entered the Central Illinois Annual Conference in the fall of 1866, being appointed Pastor of Pekin and Bloomington. In February 1870 he transferred to the Louisiana Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. He served for three years at Ames Chapel (later the St. Charles Avenue Methodist Church) in New Orleans. This was the only Methodist church in New Orleans to remain with the northern branch of the Church after the division over slavery in 1844. During the next nine years, Rev. Hartzell served as the Presiding Elder of various districts in the Louisiana Conference. For several years he also was a prominent member of the New Orleans School Board. In 1873 Rev. Hartzell began publication of The Southwestern Christian Advocate, which he carried as a private enterprise until its adoption as an official paper of the M.E. Church by the 1876 General Conference. He was editor of this paper until February 1881, when he resigned to become the Assistant Secretary of the Freedmen's Aid Society. At a General Conference he was elected Corresponding Secretary of the Freedmen's Aid and Southern Education Society, to which office he was re-elected by the 1892 General Conference. Episcopal ministry When the retirement of Bishop William Taylor made necessary a successor, the 1896 General Conference elected Dr. Hartzell Missionary Bishop for Africa. For the next four years, Bishop Hartzell traveled performing the duties of his office. He presided over four Annual Sessions of the Liberia Annual Conference. On 9 July 1897 he organized the Congo Mission Conference. He also laid the foundations of the Mission in New and Old Umtali in Manicaland. He received, as donations from the British South Africa Company, valuable lots in New Umtali. These came with appropriations of funds for the maintenance of a school among Europeans, and a tract of several thousand acres with twelve buildings (worth over $100,000 at that time) at Old Umtali, for the establishment of an industrial Mission. Bishop Hartzell held the first sessions of the East Central Africa and West Central Africa Mission Conferences, where were each formed in 1901 from the Congo Mission Conference. He dedicated the St. Andrew's M.E. Church 20 September 1903, the first Methodist Episcopal Church erected for the use of white people in Africa. In the spring of 1910, Bishop Hartzell organized the American Mission in North Africa. For his service in Africa Bishop Hartzell was made a Knight Commander of the Order for the Redemption of Africa by the Republic of Liberia. He retired at the 1916 General Conference. Bishop Hartzell died 6 September 1928 as a result of injuries sustained during a robbery at his home in Blue Ash, Ohio. He was 87. He was buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago. Legacy Hartzell Hall at Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana is named in his honor. Hartzell United Methodist Church, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hartzell High School, in Mutare, Zimbabwe is also named in his honor. Located only a few miles (2.5) from Bishop Hartzell's home in Blue Ash, the church maintains a number of artifacts related to the Bishop's life as donated by his family.

Called the \\"Prince of Pops\\" by the Chicago Tribune, he performed with a number of leading pops and symphony orchestras, especially the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra (CPO), which he led for 32 years. Early life and career Kunzel was born to German-American immigrant parents in New York City. At Greenwich High School in Connecticut, he arranged music and played the piano, string bass and timpani. Initially a chemistry major, Kunzel graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in music, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta, then studied at Harvard and Brown universities. He conducted the Brown University Glee Club for at least two years. Early in his career, he conducted for the Santa Fe Opera and studied at the Pierre Monteux School. He met his Austrian-born wife, Brunhilde, while conducting Gianni Schicchi for Santa Fe in 1964, and they married a year later. From 1960 to 1965, he conducted the Rhode Island Philharmonic. From 1965 to 1977, Kunzel served as resident conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (CSO). In 1969, he was initiated as an honorary member of the Eta-Omicron chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity at the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati. He was also a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron The Pops In 1965, Kunzel began the country's first winter pops series, the \\"8 O'Clock Pops\\". When the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra board of trustees created the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra in 1977, Kunzel was named conductor. The Pops became the larger of Cincinnati's two orchestras, as all of Max Rudolf's symphony orchestra also played for the Pops year-round. At the invitation of Arthur Fiedler in 1970, Kunzel guest-conducted over 100 concerts with the Boston Pops Orchestra. He remained active with symphony, leading the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (as Principal Pops Conductor) from 1982 to 2002. From the beginning, Kunzel strove to expand the Cincinnati Pops' reach worldwide, with nearly 90 recordings on the Telarc label, most of which became bestsellers. His popular recordings of classical music, Broadway musicals, and movie scores topped worldwide crossover charts more than any other conductor or orchestra in the world. Some of Kunzel's mentees at the Cincinnati Pops would later become notable in their own right, including Keith Lockhart of the Boston Pops and Steven Reineke of The New York Pops. The Cincinnati Pops were especially popular in Asia. The group toured Japan several times, starting in 1990. In 1998, Kunzel became the first American pops conductor to perform in China. Ten years later, he and the Cincinnati Pops were invited back to perform at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; they were the only American orchestra to play at the event. Kunzel made most of his classical music recordings as director of the Cincinnati Pops. However, he also made jazz recordings with Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, and other well-known artists. From the Capitol Building lawn, Kunzel conducted the National Symphony Orchestra every Memorial Day and Fourth of July from 1991 to 2009, in concerts televised nationwide on PBS. In 1987, his Aaron Copland: Lincoln Portrait (CD-80117) album with narration by Katharine Hepburn including Old American Songs sung by Sherrill Milnes received a Grammy nomination. Other Grammy nominations came in 1989 (A Disney Spectacular), 1991 (Meredith Willson's The Music Man), and 1993 (Amen! A Gospel Celebration). The album American Jubilee won the Grand Prix du Disque in 1989. His albums frequently feature digital sound effects created by Michael Bishop. The conductor had a large influence on Cincinnati's local music scene. In addition to conducting almost weekly subscription concerts with the Cincinnati Pops, he expanded the Pops program in 1984 to include a summer concert series at the newly built Riverbend Music Center on the banks of the Ohio River. He pushed for a new campus to house the city's public School for Creative and Performing Arts. He invited many local performers, including children's choruses and College-Conservatory students, to share the stage with the Pops. The recording engineer for Kunzel's recording of music by Copland earned a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical in 1998, for Copland: The Music of America, Kunzel earned the 2006 National Medal of Arts. In 2009, he was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame, based in Cincinnati. On June 20‚Äì21, 2008, Kunzel conducted The Toronto Symphony Orchestra's performance of Star Trek: The Music at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto. Last days In April 2009, Kunzel was diagnosed with pancreatic, liver and colon cancer and received chemotherapy treatments in Cincinnati. He conducted a final concert at Riverbend on August 1, 2009, and died a month later in Bar Harbor, Maine, near his home at Swan's Island. That day, the CSO board of trustees posthumously named him \\"Founder and Conductor Emeritus\\" of the Pops.

History Located at the southwestern tip of the island of Puerto Rico, this lighthouse was constructed in 1882 in order to guide passing ships through the southeast entrance from the Caribbean Sea through the treacherous Mona Passage into the Atlantic Ocean. The lighthouse is located over a white lime cliff which is surrounded by salt water lagoons and marshes. The cliffs surrounding the lighthouse drop over 200 feet into the ocean. The lighthouse's architecture is distinguished by its simplicity, with minimal decoration and an unelaborated cornice repeated through the structure. The illuminating apparatus is housed in a cast-iron, copper and glass lantern. The lenticular lens was manufactured by the French firm Sautter, Lemonnier and Company. Originally, the lighthouse was manned by two keepers and an engineer, who lived on the grounds with their families. In 1967 the lighthouse was renovated and its operation is currently completely automated. The structure itself has been abandoned for decades, although recent the local government as well as local civic groups, such as Caborroje√±os Pro Salud y Ambiente, are pushing towards turning the old lighthouse keeper's house into a museum. The project was taken over by the municipality, an action that lost U.S. Federal government funds that had been assigned for it. The municipality took over the renovations, which, according to critics, has irrevocably damaged the historical significance of the internal structure.

The Tarok People The Tarok people call themselves oT√°r√≥k, their language iT√°r√≥k and their land √¨T√†r√≥k. They are found principally in Langtang-North, Langtang-South, Wase, Mikang and Kanke Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Plateau State in Central Nigeria. Their main town of Langtang is located about 186 kilometres south-east of Jos, the state capital. They are also found in large numbers in Shendam, Qua'an-Pan, Kanam, Pankshin LGAs and some part of Tafawa Balewa LGA of Bauchi state the Sur (Tapshin). Scattered in Nasarawa and Taraba states are Tarok farming communities. The people have been described to some extent in anthropological and ethnographical works by Fitzpatrick (1910), Roger Blench, Lamle (1995),Lamle, E. N. (1995). Cultural Revival and Church Planting: A Nigerian Case study. Jos: CAPRO Media Famwang and Longtau (1997). The oT√°r√≥k is an amalgamation of various peoples who now form a more or less ‚Äòhomogeneous‚Äô group. The constituents were of Pe, Ngas, Jukun, Boghom, Tel ( Montol ) and probably Tal origins, while others still remain obscure or unknown. The culture at a micro level portrays this admixture of peoples of the Tarok nation. The focus here is a description of their language. Name of the Language In the literature, other names have been used for Tarok as Appa, Yergam and its variants of Yergum and Yergem. The name Tarok itself has been wrongly spelt by some as Taroh. The name Appa on the other hand is used by the Jukun to refer to oTarok as a friendship term. These fresh insights are pointing to a conclusion that Tarok was a nickname given to the Tal/Ngas immigrants. The name of the original group is lost and has been replaced by the nickname. The term Pe-Tarok refers to the people who first spoke the original form of the language called Tarok today the mismatch notwithstanding. The origins of the peoples may be a knotty topic, but it is clear that Proto- Tarok is the parent of the language which is known as Tarok today (whatever might have been their original name). Tarok in a sea of Chadic languages Longtau described Tarok as one of the Benue‚ÄìCongo languages which is almost completely submerged in a sea of Chadic languages. These languages include Ngas, Tel, Boghom, Hausa / Fulfulde and Yiwom. Its non-Chadic neighbours are Pe, Jukun-Wase and Yangkam. Tarok has spread considerably in the twentieth century and it now borders Wapan in the south-east. The Chadic languages belong to a different language family called Afroasiatic. Longtau explained that Tarok had settled in their present abode long before the eastern and southward movements of Boghom and Ngas respectively. Tarok History Nankap Elias Lamle (2001) an anthropologist lecturing at the University of Jos in Nigeria stated that in the early twentieth century people from other ethnic groups such as Tal, Ngas, Jukun, Tel (Montol/Dwal) and Yiwom (Gerkawa) migrated and settled together with the initial Timwat and Funyallang clans. People from these ethnic groups came as migrants labour workers. The Timwat and Funyallang people gave them land to settle in Tarokland after they have served the former. Colonialism and Christianity came into Tarokland by 1904 (Lamle 1995). The initial inhabitants could not trust the missionaries and colonialists as such did not encourage their people to join them. with the introduction of modernism the later migrants to Tarokland used their connections to the missionaries and colonialists to acquire western education and join the army. Today these latter migrants are at the helm of affairs in Nigeria as such tries to use their influence to change history ( cf. Lamle 2005).Lamle, E. N. Corporeality and Dwelling Spaces in Tarokland. Journal of Tarok studies: Nigerian Bible Translation Trust. Jos (Vol. 1 No 1 2005) pp 23 Furthermore, Lamle asserted that the framework of Tarok migration supports the assertion above and is based on the fact that the Tarok language is part of the Benue‚ÄìCongo language family. However, other peoples of the Chadic language family, such as the Ngas, Boghom, Tel (Montol) and Yiwom, shifted to the Benue‚ÄìCongo family and are given full status as Tarok (Lamle 1998). Also the Jukun, who speak languages of the Benue‚ÄìCongo family, joined the Tarok. What is called the Tarok people are actually a mixture of many ethno-linguistic groups (Lamle 2008). Culture The Tarok people have an ancestral cult which retains considerable prestige and importance, despite major inroads of Christianity into the area. The ancestors, or√¨m, are represented by initiated males and post-menopausal women. Cult activities take place in sacred groves outside almost all Tarok settlements. Or√¨m are mostly heard, but emerge as masked figures under some circumstances, especially for the disciplining of ‚Äòstubborn‚Äô women and for making prophecies. Or√¨m figures speak through voice disguisers in a language dotted with code words although framed in normal Tarok syntax and their utterances are interpreted by unmasked figures. Each Tarok settlement of any size has a sacred grove outside it, which is conserved as the place of the orim or ancestors. The singular form, √πr√¨m, is applied to a dead person or an ancestor, while or√¨m refers to the collective ancestors and the cult itself. Men above a certain age are allowed to enter the grove and engage with the ancestors. These inhabit the land of the dead and are thus in contact with all those who have died, including young people and children who were not admitted to the or√¨m. On certain nights when the ‚Äòor√¨m are out‚Äô, women and children must stay in their houses. Orim can also be seen ‚Äòdressed‚Äô, i.e. appearing as masquerades, when they engage with women through an interpreter. Surprisingly, most Tarok are Christian and Langtang hosts some large churches, but the association of the or√¨m with power ensures that these two systems continue to coexist. Indeed, it is said that the or√¨m take care to visit the houses of the retired generals and other influential figures at night to cement the bonds between two very different types of power. Or√¨m society is graded, in the sense that there are members who are not fully initiated and so cannot be let into the inner secrets of the society. Some of the or√¨m vocabulary is therefore for internal concealment, that is, there are code-words among the elder members to conceal the meaning of what is being said from junior members. The main function of the orim from the external point of view is to maintain order, both spiritual and actual, within the society but also to prepare for warfare and other collective action. In practice, maintaining order seems to be about disciplining women, who are forced to cook food as a punishment for being lazy or ‚Äòstubborn‚Äô. This category of or√¨m is called or√¨m aga., literally ‚Äòmasquerade that gives trouble‚Äô and its speciality is to fine women. There is a special season, aga. ‚Äòtime of trouble‚Äô, for meting out fines to offenders. The or√¨m are also in contact with the dead and it is believed that the spirits of dead children require to be fed; hence they will request special meals from the mother of such children. Or√¨m also have a marriage-broking function; for example, young women tell the or√¨m the name of the young man they would like to marry, and they find ways of passing on the message. The Tarok Website The official website of the Tarok People was recently created and launched in December, 27th 2013. It was created for the purpose of promoting their culture and tradition, which will serve as a rich resource for the up-coming generation. It also serves as a means for interaction between its members and as a voice to air out their ideas. It is aimed at promoting unity through various ways among the Taroks. It was discontinued late 2014.https://web.archive.org/web/20141004150848/http://otarok.com Prominent Tarok People * Domkat Bali, military * Joseph Nanven Garba, military * Dindam D.

It was erected as a node-based taxon as the least inclusive clade containing Prozostrodon brasiliensis, Tritylodon langaevus, Pachygenelus monus, and Mus musculus (the house mouse). All living mammals have a lesser trochanter, whose size, shape, and position is distinctive to their species.

Raised for service during the Second World War, it was formed in early 1943 from volunteers for airborne training. Despite achieving a high level of readiness, the battalion did not see action during the war and was disbanded in early 1946. History Like the British Army, Australia did not have a parachute operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans in the early stages of the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development.Dennis et al. 2008, p. 410. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps.Lord & Tennant 2000, p.16. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.Long 1963, p. 554. Initially, raised on a reduced scale of only two rifle companies, the battalion's personnel were mainly drawn from volunteers from other Army units‚Äîmostly the independent companies that had been set up in 1941‚Äì42 to carry out irregular warfare‚Äîand as a result, most of the battalion's personnel had seen active service prior to being accepted. These volunteers completed their parachute training with 1st Parachute Training Unit before joining the battalion,Lord & Tennant 2000, p. 20. and upon completion of their training qualified to wear the maroon beret, which was adopted by the 1st Parachute Battalion as a symbol of their elite status. In April 1943, while based at Scheyville Farm,McNicol 1982, p. 364. the battalion raised a troop of engineers. Consisting of six officers and 51 other ranks, the 1st Parachute Troop, Royal Australian Engineers, was specially trained to undertake clandestine demolitions work alongside the battalion's rifle companies.McNicol 1982, p. 363. As the battalion was to be Australia's first airborne unit it required extensive training. Consequently, in addition to basic parachute training at Richmond, the battalion also trained in jungle warfare at Canungra in Queensland. In September 1943, Major John Overall, formerly of the 2/13th Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, was appointed as commanding officer. Throughout this time training continued in the demolitions, tactics and parachuting, and as no reserve parachutes were used several fatalities occurred. A third rifle company was formed in October 1943 and by January 1944 the battalion was at full strength. Following company and battalion level exercises the battalion was declared ready for operations in May 1944 and moved to Mareeba airstrip in North Queensland. A fourth rifle company was formed in June 1944. In August 1944 the battalion gained its own organic indirect fire support when it was joined by the parachute qualified 1st Mountain Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, equipped with short 25 Pounder guns.Dunn 1999, p. 120. alt=Men with helmets sit in an aircraft with weapons held across their chests, strapped into parachutes In late 1944, the battalion was alerted to begin preparations for operations in Borneo as part of the Borneo campaign. As well as preparing for airborne operations, the battalion also conducted amphibious training in late January and early February 1945 as part of a possible role in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan.Dunn 1999, p. 195. The battalion was not used in this operation, however, due to a shortage of suitable aircraft.Moffit 1989, p. 229. A few months later, the battalion was also warned to prepare for a mission to rescue thousands of Allied prisoners held by the Japanese at Sandakan in North Borneo. This operation, codenamed Operation Kingfisher, was controversially also cancelled due to a lack of aircraft, and the prisoners were subsequently killed by the Japanese in what subsequently became known as the Sandakan Death Marches.Moffit 1989, p. 228. The disappointment of not being deployed to Borneo caused significant frustration within the battalion, with many soldiers requesting transfers to other infantry units such as Z Special Unit. Many of these requests were denied, however, as the battalion had been instructed to prepare to operate alongside British paratroopers in the planned liberation of Singapore that was to have taken place later in 1945 as part of Operations Zipper and Mailfist. The war ended before these operations took place, however, and following the Japanese surrender the battalion was ordered to prepare to deploy to Singapore for garrison duties. While an advance party of 120 men arrived in Singapore on 9 September, the rest of the battalion remained in Australia. The unit contributed an honour guard to the main surrender ceremony. Afterwards, a further 75 men were sent out to join them and together this force performed general garrison and policing duties before returning to Australia in January 1946. Orders were received to disband the battalion on 29 January 1946, and these were carried out the following day at Sydney.

It is considered one of the principal examples of the French film movement known as poetic realism. In 1952, it was included in the first Sight & Sound top ten greatest films list. Synopsis Foundry worker Fran√ßois (Jean Gabin) shoots and kills Valentin (Jules Berry). Fran√ßois then locks himself in his apartment. He is soon besieged by the police, who fail in an attempt to shoot their way into the room. As they regroup to decide how to apprehend him, Fran√ßois begins to reminisce on how he came to be in this predicament. Several months earlier, he had begun to date Fran√ßoise (Jacqueline Laurent), a florist's assistant. They bonded over the similarities in their names and the fact that they both were orphans. Fran√ßois fell in love with her and hoped to marry her, but she turned him down in order to have a relationship with the older Valentin, a narcissistic, manipulative dog trainer. Embittered, Fran√ßois began a relationship with Clara (Arletty), Valentin's former assistant in his dog show. Over the next few weeks, Clara fell in love with Fran√ßois, but he preferred to have only a casual relationship with her; she knew it was because he had continued to see Fran√ßoise, with whom he was still in love. One day, Valentin told Fran√ßois that he was in fact Fran√ßoise's father; she was the product of a youthful dalliance. Later that afternoon, Fran√ßois asked Fran√ßoise if Valentin was telling the truth. She denied it, saying that Valentin habitually made up stories. But she also confessed that she was falling in love with Fran√ßois and wanted to be with him. Valentin confronted Fran√ßois in his apartment. He admitted to having lied about being Fran√ßoise's father and brandished a gun with which he had intended to shoot Fran√ßois. Instead, he taunted Fran√ßois with allusions to his sexual encounters with Fran√ßoise. Enraged, Fran√ßois picked up the gun and shot Valentin. Alone in his room and out of cigarettes, Fran√ßois realizes he has no hope of escape. He does not know that Fran√ßoise, delirious with guilt, is now being tended to by Clara. The police decide to throw tear gas into Fran√ßois's room in an attempt to subdue him. But just before they do, Fran√ßois commits suicide by shooting himself in the heart.

In France, however, the film was banned in 1940 by the Vichy government on the grounds it was demoralizing. After the war's end, the film was shown again to wide acclaim. In 1947, it was again suppressed when RKO Radio Pictures wanted to remake the film in Hollywood (as The Long Night). The company acquired the distribution rights of the French film and sought to buy up and destroy every copy of the film that they could obtain. For a time it was feared that they had been successful and that the film was lost, but it re-appeared in the 1950s and has subsequently stood alongside Les Enfants du paradis as one of the finest achievements of the partnership of Carn√© and Pr√©vert. Home media In 2014, a restored version of the film was released as a region-B Blu-ray disc by Studio Canal. This version reinstates dialogue and shots (including a nude Arletty) that had been deleted by Vichy censors.

In 1989 Lamar Terrace had houses that were smaller and older relative to its area. In that period many investors had considered buying properties in the area, because Lamar Terrace was in proximity to Uptown. Silvers began buying property in Lamar Terrace in the late 1980s. He finalized a purchase of 50 Lamar Terrace lots formerly owned by Adnan Khashoggi on Tuesday November 10, 1989. Most of the Khashoggi lots were vacant.

Silvers held regular meetings with property owners of Lamar Terrace. Patricia Knudsen, the city's acting planning director at the time, told Silvers to consider establishing a public improvement district. A lawyer told Silvers that he could establish a tax-increment reinvestment zone (TIRZ). When a TIRZ is implemented, tax revenues are immediately frozen. A \\"base year\\" assessed values is placed on the properties owned by the taxing entities that participate in the TIRZ. As the development progresses, tax revenues may increase due to an increase in property values. The extra taxes are reinvested into the TIRZ zone. The lawyer also told Silvers that the State of Texas permitted TIRZs to petition to establish zoning ordinances. On December 12, 1990, Houston's Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone No. 1, serving St. George Place, became the first TIRZ in Houston. Silvers had asked the Houston City Council for twenty years of future property tax revenues so he could rebuild Lamar Terrace. The taxing entities participating in TIRZ #1 included the City of Houston, Harris County, and the Houston Independent School District. The TIRZ had a $12 million tax base in 1992. In 1993 the Houston City Council passed a zoning ordinance for St. George Place. The St. George Place boundaries expanded in 1993 to include their current boundaries. =Development of St. George Place= New home construction was slow in St. George Place. To promote home building, Silvers founded Ironwood Homes, and that company began building houses. The activity from Ironwood Homes attracted other home builders. Silvers said that he had not planned to or desired to become a developer.Wallstin, Brian. \\"Houston's Big Experiment.\\" Houston Press. Thursday December 30, 1999. 2. Retrieved on October 13, 2012. In August 1999 the St. George Place Civic Association incorporated, allowing for residents to more easily interact with the TIRZ board. In 1999 Silver said that while he was glad that St. George Place had improved, he was frustrated by the slow pace of development. He said that he wished he had never established the TIRZ, since in doing so, he was not making as much money as he would if he had immediately sold the properties that he had purchased in the late 1980s. Around 2000 new infrastructure such as sewer and water facilities was being installed to service the newly built houses, because the infrastructure built to serve Lamar Terrace was not adequate for servicing the new houses. In 2002 Silvers, as paraphrased by Thom Marshall of the Houston Chronicle, said that he had \\"planned for development of the zone to be finished by now\\" but that \\"it's only reached the halfway mark [...] because the city will not file condemnation lawsuits to take properties from investors who are not developing them.\\" In 2006 the TIRZ had a tax base of over $160 million ($ in current money).

Lazaro married another Spanish woman called Paula Gonz√°lez. They had four children. The youngest was born on 2 March 1849 and he was called Heraclio Fournier. The young Heraclio Fournier started working in the factory of his brother Braulio Fournier. The factory was called \\"Fournier hermanos\\". They created a new type of playing card, which became famous in a short period of time. Due to the success that they had had, they decided to separate themselves and they started working alone. After that Heraclio decided to go to live to Vitoria- Gasteiz. In 1868 he created a little lithography factory, it was called \\"Naipes Heraclio Fournier\\". This factory was created with the aim of being a playing card manufacturer. Later Heraclio started to make different types of stamps and to print books. As he had had with his previous work, he had a great success in Vitoria too. In 1875 Heraclio created new printing ways and new graphic models. Two years later he worked with a Spanish art teacher called Emilio Soubrier and a painter called Diaz de Olano to design a new brand of playing cards. That was going to be the first brand of his famous Spanish playing cards. In 1880 he changed his work place to a bigger one in Fueros street. Next years he travelled a lot of times to France to improve his manufacture. In 1889 he won a prize in the exposition universelle of Paris. One year later he decided to change his actual playing cards to a new deck of cards which had 12 different colours. After the changes he won a lot of prizes in Paris, Madrid, Barcelona etc. In 1916 Heraclio Fournier died in Vichy. He had no children and because of that his grandson F√©lix Alfaro Fournier became the owner of the company. F√©lix started a playing card collection. In 1970, after buying the cards of Thomas De la Rue, he opened a museum called \\"Museo Fournier de Naipes\\".

It was formed by a merger of Sava and Littoral banovinas into a single autonomous entity, with small parts of the Drina, Zeta, and Danube banovinas also included. Its capital was Zagreb and it included most of present-day Croatia along with portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. It had a surface area of 65,456 km2 and a population of 4,024,601 in late 1939. Its sole Ban during this period was Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá. Background In the Vidovdan Constitution of 1921, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes had established 33 administrative districts, each headed by a government-appointed prefect. Both the Vidovdan Constitution in general and the administrative districts in particular were part of the design of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá and Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá to maximize the power of the ethnic Serb population within the new state. The new constitution was passed in a political climate favorable to the Serbian centralists, as the Croatian regionalists chose to abstain from parliamentary duty, whereas the deputies of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia were excluded by a parliamentary vote. An amendment to the electoral law in June of 1922 further stacked the deck in favor of the Serbian population, when electoral constituencies were created based on pre-war census figures, allowing Serbia to ignore its massive military casualties sustained in the First World War. This only furthered the resentment felt by the proponents of a federate or confederate state towards the government, particularly the Croatian regionalists of the Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) around Stjepan Radiƒá. Radiƒá was shot in parliament by a Serbian delegate in 1928 and died two months later. This provoked the withdrawal of the HRSS from the assembly, forged an anti-Belgrade mindset in Croatia and ultimately led to the collapse of the constitutional system of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After fruitless efforts to fix the Serb-Croat divide and Croat abstention from government, including a cabinet headed by the nominally neutral Slovene Anton Koro≈°ec, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia intervened and, on 6 January 1929, established the 6 January Dictatorship. On 3 October 1929, the country was officially renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in an effort to unite the various ethnicities into a greater national identity. The new state had a new constitution, and in place of the 33 administrative districts of the Vidovdan Constitution, it instead established the banovinas. The banovinas were drawn in a way to avoid the old historical, regionalist or ethnic affiliations, but because the King still had a vested interest in maintaining the Serb dominance from which he drew most of his legitimacy as King, six of the nine Banovinas ended up with Serb majorities. Instead of uniting Serbs and Croats into a joint Yugoslav identity, there was widespread Croatian resentment against a perceived Serbian hegemony instead. Over the course of the next ten years, the royal dictatorship grew in strength and ruled with authoritarian decrees, climaxing in the tenure of Milan Stojadinoviƒá as Prime Minister between 1936 and 1939. Stojadinoviƒá, who had adopted fascist symbolism, gestures and titles from Benito Mussolini in his aspirations to be Yugoslavia's strongman, ultimately fell from grace because he lost the faith of minority representatives in February of 1939. He was replaced by Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá, who, in an effort to win Croat support for his government, opened talks with Radiƒá's successor as leader of the Croatian regionalists, Vladko Maƒçek. In a compromise named after the two, the Cvetkoviƒá-Maƒçek Agreement (also known as the Sporazum), the central government made the concession of merging two of the nine banovinas, Sava and Littoral, into one, the Banovina of Croatia. History On the basis of the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement, and the Decree on the Banate of Croatia (Uredba o Banovini Hrvatskoj) dated 24 August 1939, the Banate of Croatia was created.Croatian History Museum The entire area of the Sava and Littoral Banovinas was combined and parts of the Vrbas, Zeta, Drina and Danube banovinas (districts Brƒçko, Derventa, Dubrovnik, Fojnica, Gradaƒçac, Ilok, ≈†id and Travnik) were added to form the Banate of Croatia.Uredba o banovini Hrvatskoj The borders of the Banate of Croatia are partly the historical borders of Croatia, and partly based on the application of the principle of ethnicity according to which Bosnian and Herzegovinian territory with a majority Croat population was annexed to the Banate. Under the Agreement, central government continued to control defense, internal security, foreign policy, trade, and transport; but an elected Sabor and a crown-appointed ban would decide internal matters in Croatia. Ironically, the Agreement fueled separatism. Maƒçek and other Croats viewed autonomy as a first step toward full Croatian independence, so they began haggling over territory; Serbs attacked Cvetkoviƒá, charging that the Agreement brought them no return to democracy and no autonomy; Muslims demanded an autonomous Bosnia; and Slovenes and Montenegrins espoused federalism.

A Lone Scout must meet the membership requirements of the Scouting organization to which they belong and have an adult Scout leader or counselor who may be a parent, guardian, minister, teacher, or another adult. The leader or counselor instructs the boy and reviews all steps of Scouting advancement. Lone Scouts can be in the Scout Section or sections for older young people, and in some countries in the Cub section or sections for younger boys. They follow the same program as other Scouts and may advance in the same way as all other Scouts. Lone Scouts exist in many countries in the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. History John Hargrave was the inspirator of the Lone Scouts. Hargrave wrote a series of articles for \\"Lone Scouts\\", held Lonecraft Camps and wrote Lonecraft, the handbook for Lone Scouts, published in 1913.John Hargrave, Lonecraft, the handbook for Lone Scouts, Constable and Company Ltd, London, 1913 Hargrave's book referred to individual Lone Scouts and Lone Patrols. Hargrave dedicated his book to naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton, founder of the Woodcraft League. Hargrave was an early Boy Scout and, in 1917, became Commissioner for Woodcraft and Camping in the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts but Baden-Powell and his organization refused to recognize Hargrave's Lone Scouts and Woodcraft Scouting.Tim Jeal, Baden-Powell, Hutchinson, London, 1989 pp501-502 Hargrave, a Quaker pacifist and medical corps war veteran of the disastrous 1915 Gallipoli Campaign, became increasingly disenchanted with the military dominated leadership and militarism of the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts and in February, 1919, he held a meeting of like-minded Scout leaders. In 1920 Hargrave formed the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift and in January 1921 he was expelled from Baden-Powell's organization. Many Lone Scouts disassociated from the Baden-Powell organization, some joined Hargrave's Kibbo Kift while others joined the British Boy Scouts, other National Peace Scouts or remained independent Scouts and patrols. The term \\"Lone Scout\\" was later officially adopted by Baden- Powell's Boy Scouts Association. The Lone Scouts of America were formed in 1915 by William D. Boyce, a Chicago newspaper entrepreneur. This organization merged with the Boy Scouts of America in 1924; its mission has been carried on through the BSA Lone Cub Scout and Lone Boy Scout programs. US Criteria Boys/Girls (in the USA) who are eligible to become Lone Scouts include: *Children of American citizens who live abroad *Exchange students away from the United States for a year or more *Boys/girls with disabilities that might prevent them from attending regular meetings of packs or troops *Boys/Girls in rural communities who live far from a Scouting unit *Sons/Daughters of migrant farmworkers *Boys/Girls who attend night schools or boarding schools *Boys/Girls who have jobs that conflict with troop meetings *Boys/Girls whose families travel frequently, such as circus families, families who live on boats, missionaries, etc. *Boys/Girls who alternate living arrangements with parents who live in different communities *Boys/Girls who are unable to attend unit meetings because of life-threatening communicable diseases *Boys/Girls whose parents believe their child might be endangered by getting to Scout unit meetings *Boys/Girls being home schooled whose parents do not want them in a youth group See also *Lone Guides *Lone Scouts of America References Peterson, Robert (October 2001).

The site for the palace was chosen so that official visitors to Luang Prabang could disembark from their river voyages directly below the palace and be received there. After the death of King Sisavang Vong, the Crown Prince Savang Vatthana and his family were the last to occupy the grounds. In 1975, the monarchy was overthrown by the communists and the royal family were taken to re-education camps. The palace was then converted into a national museum. The Grounds Statue of Sisavang Vong on the palace grounds On the palace grounds, there are other buildings surrounding the palace which includes: *Kitchen/Storage *Royal Barge Shelter *Conference Hall *Haw Pha Bang *Staff Headquarters There is a lotus pond and two cannons at the entrance of the palace. A statue of King Sisavang Vong is outside the conference hall. Architecture and furnishings The architecture of the palace has a mixed of traditional Lao motifs and French Beaux Arts styles. It was laid out in a double-cruciform shape with the entrance on one side of the lower crossbar. Above the entrance is a three-headed elephant sheltered by the sacred white parasol, the symbol of the Lao monarchy. The steps to the entrance are made of Italian marble. There are royal religious objects on display in the large Entrance Hall. On the right of the entrance is the King's reception room, where busts of the Luang Phrabang and, later, Lao monarchs are displayed along with two large gilded and lacquered Ramayana screens, crafted by the local artisan Thit Tanh. The walls are covered with murals that depict scenes from traditional Lao lifestyles, painted in 1930 by a French artist, Alix de Fauntereau. Each of the walls is intended to be viewed at a different time of day, depending on the light that enters the windows on one side of the room, which matches the time of day depicted. In the right front corner room of the palace, which opens to the outside, is a collection of the palace's most prized art, including the Phra Bang, cast of a gold, silver and bronze alloy. This Buddha stands 83 cm tall and weighs around 50 kg. Legend has it that the statue was made around the 1st century in Sri Lanka and was later presented to the Khemer King Phaya Sirichantha, who then gave it to King Fa Ngum in 1359 as a Lao Buddhist leader. The Siamese twice took the image to Thailand in 1779 and 1827, but it was returned to Laos by King Mongkut in 1867. There are rumours that the one on display is a copy and the original is stored in Vientiane or Moscow. It is said the real one had gold leaf over the eyes and a hole drilled through one of its ankle. Also in the room are another Buddha, engraved with large elephant tusks, and three beautiful saew m√¢i kh√°n (embroidered silk screens with religious imagery) that were crafted by the Queen. On the left of the Entrance Hall, the secretary's reception room is filled with paintings, silver and china that have been presented to Laos as diplomatic gifts from Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Japan, Vietnam, China, Nepal, United States, Canada and Australia. These objects are grouped by \\"socialist\\" and \\"capitalist\\" countries. One exhibit donated by the USA is a piece of moon rock obtained by an Apollo mission. The next room to the left was once the Queen's reception room. Large royal portraits of King Savang Vatthana, Queen Khamphoui and Crown Prince Vong Savang, painted by Russian artist Ilya Glazunov in 1967, are hung on the walls. There are friendship flags from China and Vietnam and replicas of sculpture from the National Museum, New Delhi. In the far rooms are the royal family's bedrooms and living quarters. The bedrooms have been preserved as they were in 1975 when the King was forced from the palace. There is a dining hall and a room that contains royal seals and medals. The Throne Room contains the Crown Jewels of Laos.

The Department of Immigration and Citizenship notes that South Sudan became independent from the Republic of Sudan on 9 July 2011, shortly before the census, and that \\"country of birth figures as completed by individuals at the time of the 2011 Census may not fully reflect this change\\". The census, held in August, included both Sudan and South Sudan amongst the country of birth and ancestry options.

Between 1996 and 2005, the largest increase in Australian people born overseas were Sudanese, at 28% per year. Other fast-growing overseas-born groups were people from Afghanistan (12% average increase per year) and Iraq (10%).

For recent history of, and current definitions of war of aggression in international law, see that article.) The concept of supreme crime is a legal principle that to initiate war not in self-defense, called war of aggression in international law, but with the intent to conquer territory and subjugate other people, is more egregious than a normal crime. The term was introduced by Justice Robert H. Jackson, chief prosecutor for the United States at the Nuremberg Trials. Background The loss of human life during World War I prompted the debate about the legality of war-making in the League of Nations. Shortly after the cessation of hostilities on the European theatre of World War II, Jackson framed the legal principles making the initiation of a war of aggression a supreme crime as follows: * The power of sovereign states to make war, except in self-defense, should be restricted by law. (\\"It is high time that we act on the juridical principle that aggressive war-making is illegal and criminal\\") * This law must apply equally to all nations. (\\"I am not willing to charge as a crime against a German official acts which would not be crimes if committed by officials of the United States\\") * Nations can act only through their leaders and thus the individuals responsible for initiation of an aggressive war are accountable for acts of violence against others committed in the name of the state.

Formed in mid-1942 as part of defensive measures to protect the eastern coast of Australia from invasion, the corps was initially composed mainly of home defence troops drawn from the Militia. For a brief period in 1942, a US infantry division was also assigned to the corps prior to its dispatch to fight the Japanese in New Guinea. After the threat of invasion passed, the corps took more of an operational role and from late 1943 until the end of the war it commanded a mix of Second Australian Imperial Force and Militia units in action against the Japanese in New Guinea and on Bougainville. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the corps headquarters was disbanded in September 1945, and its constituent units transferred to the 3rd Infantry Division. History II Corps headquarters was established at Parramatta, New South Wales, in mid-April 1942 from the previously existing Eastern Command (formerly the 2nd Military District) to command Australian Army units deployed to protect the strategically and economically important Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle‚ÄìPort Kembla region against a potential invasion. Upon establishment, the corps was assigned to the First Army and was commanded by Lieutenant General John Northcott. It was one of three corps raised by the Army during the war. At the outset, the corps consisted of several Militia formations, including the 1st Infantry Division, Newcastle Covering Force, the 1st Cavalry Division and the 2nd Infantry Division. Australian military districts However, throughout the corps' existence, its composition changed many times. The first change came a couple months after its formation when, in July, the 2nd Infantry Division was transferred to Western Australia, to join III Corps, and II Corps headquarters moved north to Queensland. Initially, it had been planned to move to Gayndah, but the dispatch of the Australian I Corps and the 7th Infantry Division to New Guinea resulted in II Corps headquarters being sent to Esk instead. At this time, the corps gained control of the Australian 3rd Infantry Division and the US 32nd Infantry Division, which were positioned astride the state capital of Brisbane. There was a change in command in August‚ÄìSeptember 1942, when Lieutenant General Edmund Herring took over from Northcott as part of a restructuring of the Army. Further changes occurred over the next few months. As the fighting in New Guinea escalated, the 32nd Infantry Division was deployed to the combat zone and II Corps was reduced to only the Australian 3rd Infantry Division and a large number of support troops, including those that had been left behind by I Corps. The headquarters moved to Mount Mee, Queensland, in December 1942, but this was only short-lived as another move took place the following month, which saw II Corps move to Barrine, Queensland, on the Atherton Tablelands. The area had been selected as the location of a large concentration area for Australian troops to rest and prepare for jungle warfare prior to further offensives, and II Corps was given responsibility for the base area and training programs. Throughout the first half of 1943, all three of the remaining Second Australian Imperial Force infantry divisions moved through the area, with the 7th Infantry Division concentrating around Ravenshoe in February, followed by the 6th and 9th Infantry Division a month later at Wondecla and Kairi respectively. In the second half of 1943, the Army was reorganised just before the operations to secure Lae. The 7th Infantry Division was sent to Port Moresby in July and the 9th Infantry Division went to Milne Bay. By August 1943, II Corps was under the command of Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, with its headquarters at Barinne, with the 6th Division (consisting of the 16th and 19th Infantry Brigades), and the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment under its control. Two months later, the corps was committed to an operational role in New Guinea. At this time, the corps headquarters was deployed to Dobodura where it took over from I Corps, and given control of a wide area and a number of divisions, including several in combat: the 7th Infantry Division, which was advancing through the Markham and Ramu Valleys, the 9th Infantry Division on the securing the Huon Peninsula, as well as the Militia 5th and 11th Infantry Divisions, which were undertaking garrison duties in Lae and Buna. An Australian mortar team during an exercise on Sirot Island, December 1944 In November 1943, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman took over command from Morshead. The politics of this promotion ‚Äì and the non promotion of the 7th Division's commander, Major General George Vasey, meant that the 7th Division was removed from II Corps and became a direct reporting until under New Guinea Force. Meanwhile, advanced elements of II Corps headquarters moved from Finschhafen, leaving a rear detachment behind at Dobodura. After the Sio was secured, the 9th Infantry Division was withdrawn to Australia for rest in February 1944, while the 5th Infantry Division replaced them around Finschhafen. In April, Madang was captured, effectively bringing large scale combat operations to a close temporarily for Australian forces in New Guinea, and allowing a reorganisation. At this time, the 11th Infantry Division moved from Buna via Lae to relieve the 7th Infantry Division in the Markham and Ramu Valleys. The same month, the headquarters staff of II Corps were relieved by those from I Corps, with Lieutenant General Stanley Savige arriving from the Atherton Tablelands to assume command. It was a swap of personnel only, with the deployed corps keeping the designation of II Corps. Nevertheless, in May, II Corps headquarters was redesignated as Headquarters New Guinea force when the previous New Guinea Force was disbanded; based in Lae, the formation' main elements were in Madang (5th Infantry Division), and Lae (11th Infantry Division), and the 3rd Infantry Division in the process of arriving. cross the Hongorai River, on Bougainville, May 1945 The final months of 1944 saw the Australians assume responsibility for several rear areas in New Guinea and elsewhere, to relieve US troops and free them up for further offensives in the Philippines. A reorganisation followed as preparations were made for deployments to Bougainville, New Britain and western New Guinea. The headquarters of the First Australian Army was established at Lae with a view to assuming control of all Australian forces in New Guinea. Consequently, the 5th Division became a direct command unit of the First Army for its deployment to New Britain, and Headquarters New Guinea force was redesignated as II Corps in September. II Corps subsequently moved to Torokina, on Bougainville, in November to take over from the US XIV Corps, and to direct the operations of the 3rd Division (consisting of the 7th, 15th and 29th Infantry Brigades), as well as two other brigades ‚Äì 11th and 23rd, with the later initially detailed to defend the Outer Islands (Green, Emirau, and the Treasury Islands, and Munda, on New Georgia). While the US troops had largely remained in the perimeter that had been established around Torokina, the Australians began offensive operations, to advance south towards the main Japanese base in Buin, to secure Numa Numa in the centre of the island, and push north towards Buka. When the fighting came to an end in mid-August 1945, the Australians were just short of their objective in the south and had made gains in the other two sectors. Following the cessation of hostilities, II Corps staff took the surrender of Lieutenant General Masatane Kanda's Seventeenth Army on Bougainville, and implemented the terms of surrender throughout August and September. As preparations were made for the post-war draw down of Australia's military, the 23rd Brigade was chosen to remain on Bougainville as a garrison force. On 23 September, the corps commander, Savige, relinquished command to assume the role of Director of Demobilisation and Repatriation in Melbourne. In his stead, Major General William Bridgeford assumed administrative command. The following day, 24 September, II Corps headquarters closed. The formation's constituent units were then transferred to the direct command of the 3rd Infantry Division. In the post war period, no corps-level formations have been raised by the Australian Army.

Mathetics considers and uses findings of current interest from pedagogical psychology, neurophysiology and information technology.

The origin of the word, according to Papert, is not from \\"mathematics,\\" but from the Greek, mathƒìmatikos, which means \\"disposed to learn.\\" He feels this word (or one like it) should become as much part of the vocabulary about education as is the word pedagogy or instructional design. In Chapter 6 of The Children's Machine, Papert mentions six case studies, and all six have their own accompanying learning moral and they all continue his discussion of his views of mathetics. Case study 2 looks at people who use mathematics to change and alter their recipes while cooking. His emphasis here is the use of mathematical knowledge without formal instruction, which he considers to be the central mathetic moral of the study. Papert states \\"The central epistemological moral is that we all used concrete forms of reasoning. The central mathetic moral is that in doing this we demonstrated we had learned to do something mathematical without instruction ‚Äì and even despite having been taught to proceed differently\\" (p. 115).Papert, S. (1993). The Children's Machine: Rethinking School in the Age of the Computer: Basic Books, Inc. New York, NY, USA. Papert's 1980 book, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas, discusses the mathetic approach to learning. By using a mathetic approach, Papert feels that independent learning and creative thinking are being encouraged. The mathetic approach can be summarized as \\"learning by doing.\\" Many proponents of the mathetic approach feel that the best, and maybe the only, way to learn is by self-discovery.

It was built from 1863 to 1919. It is also known as the Picton Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 1 July 1869.Picton Station NSWrail.net The station is unusually sited, with southbound journeys actually heading north out of the station before traversing a 225 degree horseshoe curve to again head south, and likewise northbound services heading south before rounding a number of curves to resume their true direction.  History =Picton= The town of Picton was named by Major Antill after Sir Thomas Picton in 1841. The location was previously known as \\"Stonequarry\\". The Duke of Wellington described Picton as a \\"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\\" but very capable. He was \\"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the Battle of Waterloo and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, Hanover Square in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.Wheeldon, 2015, 3. Following the construction of a new alignment via Bargo in 1919, Picton became a junction station with the original line being retained as a branch line. These trains departed from a dock platform at the southern end of Platform 2. Picton previously had an extensive yard north of the station including locomotive servicing facilities and a turntable. A passing loop ran behind Platform 2 until 2011, when it was removed to allow a lift to be installed. Picton is a destination for NSW Rail Museum steam trains from Thirlmere, although with the elimination of Picton yard, these now require a locomotive at each end. Platforms and services Picton has two side platforms. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Southern Highlands Line services travelling between Campbelltown and Moss Vale with morning services to Sydney Central & evening services to Goulburn.  Description  The railway station complex managed by the Transport Asset Holding Entity includes a type 3, second class station building, erected in 1863; a footbridge, erected ; and a two-storey, timber signal box with a hipped roof, erected in 1919. Other items includes the remains of an engine shed located at from Central, at a site managed by the ARTC. =Station building (1863)= The Station Building is a simple single- storey Victorian Georgian style building. The building sits on a stone plinth with painted brickwork walls and a symmetrical front elevation with 2 x 6 pane double hung timber framed sash windows. The building has a linear arrangement with attached parapeted wings at each end containing toilets in one wing and lamp room in the other. The other facilities in the building include a ladies waiting room, telegraph office, booking office and clerks office and baggage office. Access to the platform is through the central booking office. The building features a hipped slate roof with a major awning to the platform rebuilt at an unknown period and originally supported on columns. The street frontage has a hipped verandah supported on timber posts. An indication of the individuality of railway station gardens is given by a hanging wall-mounted specimen of stag's horn fern Platycerium superbum) attached to the station building wall at Picton.Longworth, 2012, 11 =Footbridge ()= The station Footbridge was rebuilt in with new steel girders and concrete deck. =Signal Box (1919)= This is a large signal box located on the platform and was constructed in 1919. It is a timber structure with windows on three sides of the upper level. Access is from the platform via an external stair with WC on the landing. The roof is hipped, clad in corrugated iron overhanging on all sides to shade the upper windows. This is one of a small number of similar boxes remaining in the state. Transport links Picton Buslines operate six routes to and from Picton station: *900: to Campbelltown station *901: to Wilton & Douglas Park *911: to Buxton & Bargo *912: to Bargo & Yanderra *913: to Buxton & Thirlmere *914: to Buxton & Thirlmere Berrima Buslines operate one route via Picton station for NSW TrainLink: *Loopline Bus: to Bowral station  Heritage listing  As at 30 November 2010, Picton Railway Precinct is of state significance as one of the earliest surviving railway locations in NSW, opening in 1863 only eight years after the first line from Sydney to Parramatta in 1855. Picton Railway Precinct is significant as the terminus of the Southern line until 1867 prior to the extension of the Great Southern Line through to Mittagong, Goulburn and on to Albury. The construction of the line to Picton is significant for its association with John Whitton, Engineer-in- Chief of the NSWGR, and was one of his early achievements during his long career. The design of the Picton station building is also attributed to Whitton and is a fine example of a simple Victorian Georgian style station building that remains substantially intact. The signal box built in 1919 is a good example of an elevated timber signal box, representative of other similar structures in the network.

Early career An opening bowler, Rajinder Pal made his first-class debut in 1954‚Äì55 for Delhi at the age of 17. While he was studying at Delhi University he played for Indian Universities in first-class matches against the New Zealanders in 1955‚Äì56 and the Australians in 1959‚Äì60, as well as playing for Delhi University in the inter-university competition, the Rohinton Baria Trophy. When Delhi University won the trophy in 1959‚Äì60 he took eight wickets in the final. He took 8 for 54 and 4 for 125 for Delhi against Railways in the Ranji Trophy in 1959‚Äì60, and captained Delhi in 1960‚Äì61 and 1961‚Äì62. In his first match as captain he took 6 for 3 and 3 for 17 against Jammu and Kashmir, bowling unchanged throughout the match as Jammu and Kashmir were dismissed for 23 and 28. In 1961‚Äì62 he was selected to play for the Indian Board President's XI against the MCC and took four wickets, including that of Ted Dexter, bowled for 3. He also played in the corresponding match when the MCC toured in 1963‚Äì64, and despite taking only one wicket, he was selected to play in the Second Test shortly afterwards. Test match in 1963‚Äì64 The 1963‚Äì64 series was played on exceedingly slow pitches, and all five Tests were drawn. In his report in Wisden, E.M. Wellings described the pitches as \\"so slow and true that a competent craftsman could bat successfully with a broom handle ... the matches were doomed to be drawn almost from the outset\\".E.M. Wellings, \\"M.C.C. Team in India, 1963‚Äì64\\", Wisden 1965, p. 800. Ian Wooldridge wrote that India \\"included one fast bowler in her side more out of convention than for any tactical purpose\\".Ian Wooldridge, \\"Indian Summer for England\\", Australian Cricket, December 1968, p. 45. In the First Test that bowler was Vasant Ranjane, who took one wicket. Rajinder Pal took Ranjane's place in the Second Test and bowled 13 overs in the match for 22 runs and no wicket. Wooldridge was dismissive of his performance, comparing his pace, somewhat hyperbolically, with that of the Australian spinner Johnny Martin, and saying that, when his deliveries bounced, \\"the batsman was almost striking a stationary ball\\". Ramakant Desai replaced Rajinder Pal for the next two Tests, and for the Fifth Test India played no pace bowler at all.Wisden 1965, pp. 809‚Äì17. Later career Rajinder Pal continued to play in the Ranji Trophy for Delhi until the 1965‚Äì66 season, when he played for Southern Punjab, who he captained in 1966‚Äì67. He played for Punjab as the new team's inaugural captain in 1968‚Äì69, then under Malhotra Chamanlal in 1969‚Äì70, returned to Delhi in 1971‚Äì72, and finished his career with Haryana in 1972‚Äì73 and 1973‚Äì74. His career record of 337 wickets at an average of 21.89 disguises a tendency to excel against weaker teams but struggle in stronger competition. In 12 Ranji Trophy matches against Jammu and Kashmir he took 60 wickets at 9.53, but for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy he took 16 wickets at 41.87 in 10 matches. His brother Ravinder Pal played a few matches for Delhi in the 1960s. They opened the bowling together against Jammu and Kashmir in the only match they played together in 1964‚Äì65, then in 1965‚Äì66 they opened the bowling for opposing sides when Delhi played Southern Punjab, taking 15 wickets between them. He became a coach, running the Rajinder Pal Cricket Academy in New Delhi. Kapil Dev spent a week learning from him before touring England for the first time in 1979.Mihir Bose, A History of Indian Cricket, Andre Deutsch, London, 1990, p. 303. When the Board of Control for Cricket in India announced a pension scheme for former Test players in 2004, Rajinder Pal said he would donate his for \\"the development of future Uttaranchal cricketers\\".\\"Kapil Dev donates his pension to orphanage\\" Retrieved 11 July 2013 Death Rajinder Pal died on 9 May 2018 at his residence in Dehradun.

The album marked a departure from the brooding synthesizers and melodies of their first two albums, focusing more on sampling inspired by acid house. The singles released from the album were \\"Windowpane\\" and \\"The Snow\\". Guest vocalists include Marc Almond on the song \\"Titan Arch\\" and Annie Anxiety on the song \\"Things Happen\\". Background The recording sessions for Love's Secret Domain were characterized by Coil's compulsive drug use at the time, along with sleep deprivation which apparently lead to conflict between members; Peter Christopherson remarked that '[he could] remember Balance and Steve having these mad arguments that would go on for 48 hours without sleep over which sequence of words should be used'. In a period of constant drug use during the sessions, they both struggled with using the studio mixing room due to constant hallucinations of '10 foot tall Amazonian warriors and Babylonian kings' who were 'crowding' the room. Stephen Thrower admitted he had experienced synchronized hallucinations with Balance during this period. The cover features a painting by Steven Stapleton originally created on an outhouse door that he found in Cooloorta, most known as his hometown. A working title for the album was The Side Effects of Life. The final track, \\"Love's Secret Domain\\", borrows lyrics from the song \\"In Dreams\\" by Roy Orbison: \\"In dreams I walk with you / In dreams I talk to you / In dreams you're mine / All the time.\\" Lyrics are also culled from \\"The Sick Rose\\" by William Blake, specifically, \\"O rose, thou art sick\\", besides a quotation from Arthur Machen's short story The White People. Love's Secret Domain was later remastered by Thighpaulsandra with slightly different track lengths.

It serves as home for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati POPS Orchestra, the Cincinnati Ballet, the Cincinnati Opera and the May Festival Chorus. Springer Auditorium also houses the iconic Music Hall Chandelier. The Czechoslovakian piece was sent to the United States in pieces, and was officially installed in Springer Auditorium in the early 1970s. It was found and purchased by the Corbett Family as they financed the multi-year renovation of the auditorium. The chandelier weighs approximately 1,500 pounds with a diameter of 21 feet. It also includes 96 candles, each lit with an individual bulb. Detail of the auditorium crystal chandelier Music Hall Ballroom accommodates up to 1,300 people, and is the second largest meeting space in the city, encompassing nearly . It is frequently used for large receptions, exhibitions, fashion shows, class reunions and breakfast, lunch and dinner gatherings. Prior to 1974 the space was known as the Topper Ballroom and has been managed by numerous outside organizations since its opening in 1928. Additionally, the space has undergone numerous renovations such as those in 1935, 1947, 1959, and a $1.8 million renovation of the Ballroom in October 1998. In July 2007, organ rebuilder Ronald F. Wehmeier of Cincinnati announced the Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ that once graced the old Albee Theater in Cincinnati would be restored and installed in Music Hall's Ballroom for a New Year's Eve 2009 debut. Corbett Tower was originally known as Dexter Hall, in honor of a member of the Music Hall Building Committee. The 3rd floor space originally served as a performance hall for the Cincinnati College of Music. Later, the tower was used for radio and television broadcasts, both for the College of Music and WCET. In 1972 the space was renovated and renamed for the longtime Music Hall patrons, J. Ralph and Patricia Corbett. The Corbett Foundation also financed the renovation and limited restoration of the space again in 1994. Corbett Tower serves as the setting for a wide variety of events, ranging from weddings and receptions to grand dinners and parties.

Architecture  Cincinnati Music Hall was designed by architect Samuel Hannaford and is considered one of the last and best examples of the Victorian Gothic Revival Style. Some of the spaces most notable features include the steeply-pitched gable roof, the corbelled brick, the tracery featured on the front windows, and the large Rose Window on the facade of the building. Additionally, the facility varies from a traditional performance hall in the fact that Music Hall is actually made up of 3 distinct and separate buildings; Music Hall, the North Exposition Building, and the South Exposition Building.

The building was also known for its detailed brickwork, which included both carved and painted details on the building's exterior. However, during the 1969-1975 renovation, the building's exterior was sandblasted, destroying the majority of these details. History=Pre- construction = On September 13, 1818, the City of Cincinnati purchased a plot of land from Jesse Embree for $3,200 on the west side of Elm Street, just north of 12th Street.Greve 1904, pg. 983. On January 22, 1821, the Ohio State Legislature passed an act that established \\"a Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum for the state of Ohio.\\" Thus, Ohio's first insane asylum was erected in Cincinnati on of land bounded by the Miami and Erie Canal.Greve 1904, pg. 956. The Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio was the parent institution for the Orphan Asylum, the City Infirmary, the Cincinnati Hospital, and Longview Asylum. Cincinnati Hospital, the main facility, was located along the canal at 12th and Plum Streets,Greve 1904, pg. 674. which is now 12th and Central Parkway. Following the Cholera outbreak of 1832, the land was used as a \\"pauper's cemetery\\" until 1857 when city encroachment on the neighborhood made it unsuitable for such uses. Serious complaints from abutting property owners forced the \\"Pest House\\" to be relocated outside of the city limits. On January 29, 1859, the city converted the property into a park known as Elm Street Park and the land and buildings were used for exposition purposes until 1876 when it was turned over to the Music Hall Association. =Choir festivals and expositions= Cincinnati's first industrial exposition, which was in 1869, was a great success so the city wanted to expand it the following year.Greve 1904, pg. 864. At the same time, German musicians had plans to erect \\"a great temporary building opposite Washington Park\\" for the North American Saengerbund, which Cincinnati was to host during the summer of 1870. The two competing groups reached an agreement to construct a building that would be shared.Greve 1904, pg. 865. Depending on its use, the building was sometimes called Exposition Hall or Saengerfest Hall. Exposition Hall Exposition Hall was a huge wooden structure measuring long, wide, and tall. Additionally, there were three other temporary buildings attached to it for a total floor space of more than that of the 1853 World's Fair in New York City. The roof of the building was covered in tin. According to lore, a thunderstorm arose during an 1875 May Festival performance. Rain on the tin roof grew so loud that the chorus was drowned out and the performance had to cease. In the audience during that performance was Reuben R. Springer (1800‚Äì1884), a wealthy Cincinnatian of German ancestry, who afterwards decided Cincinnati needed a more permanent structure. =Construction= The original design of Music Hall. Springer, influenced by the beneficial results the industrial expositions and musical festivals had on the city, wrote a letter in May 1875 to John Shillito, owner of Shillito's department store, offering to donate $125,000 under two conditions.Greve 1904, pg. 926. First, that the site be free from taxation, and second, that a further sum of $125,000 be raised by the community.Greve 1904, pg. 879. When only $106,000 was raised Springer donated an additional $20,000. From the outset, the musical and industrial interests collided, so Springer offered an additional $50,000 if $100,000 could be raised. This additional sum of money would be used for the construction of buildings around the hall for the purpose of holding industrial expositions. The total cost of Music Hall was $300,962.78 with the exposition wings an additional $146,331.51. Along with other community leaders such as Julius Dexter, W. H. Harrison, T. D. Lincoln, Joseph Longworth, Robert Mitchell, John Shillito and Reuben Springer organized the Music Hall Association to build the new hall. The group oversaw the construction and fundraising necessary to complete the space. Construction on Cincinnati Music Hall began in 1876, shortly after Hannaford and Porter was given the contract. The project was divided into multiple phases, first focusing on the construction of the center building, Music Hall. Following several issues regarding weather and resources, the project was fast tracked in hopes of completing work on Music Hall prior to the 1878 May Festival Chorus performance. After Music Hall was completed, new funds were raised and resources were allocated for the completion of both the Northern and Southern Exposition Halls, two spaces utilized as the City of Cincinnati's primary convention spaces from their construction through the 1970s. Although the 3 buildings were constructed separately, they were immediately joined together using second story passageways. This allowed for events to span all 3 spaces while also allowing several groups to share this space at once. =Completion= The first performance took place on May 14, 1878. An estimated 6,000 saw the opera \\"Alceste\\" by Christoph Willibald Gluck performed, as well as Beethoven's \\"Eroica\\" symphony. These performances were especially significant as they included the May Festival Chorus and the Cincinnati Opera, two groups that were officially transitioning from other venues, such as the Cincinnati Zoo, to Music Hall as their permanent homes. Music Hall was then used independently for over a year, until both the North and South Exposition Halls were officially completed on September 2, 1879. = Performances and Events = In addition to Music Hall's traditional role of housing the city's major arts organizations and formerly the college of music, the building served as Cincinnati's major convention center through the 1970s, when the Duke Energy Convention Center was built. As early as 1879, Music Hall began to see notable guests such as President Ulysses S. Grant. He spoke at the venue on December 12, 1879. He addressed the public at Music Hall and the venue was overflowing with people according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The building has also hosted numerous other presidents such as William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Benjamin Harrison, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. June 22‚Äì24, 1880, the Democratic National Convention was held at Music Hall. This event resulted in the nomination of Winfield S. Hancock of Pennsylvania for President and William H. English of Indiana for Vice President in the United States presidential election of 1880. Additionally, this event was noteworthy due to the unique addition of Western Union Telegraph Wires to Music Hall for convention use, a task that had not been completed for major performance halls in the past. Overtime, the space also hosts numerous, notable musical performances such as the well known conductor, Richard Strauss in 1904, the world premier of the Opera ‚ÄúTaming of the Shrew‚Äù in 1953, and many other musical performances. Prior to being given their own homes, several Cincinnati organizations were housed in music hall including the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Cincinnati College of Music, the Cincinnati College of Engineering, and the television station WCET. The hall also housed a roller skating venue in one of the exposition halls for over 30 years, and was home to the Ohio Valley Exposition for over half a century. Deceased musicians that have performed at Cincinnati Music Hall include: French organist Alexandre Guilmant in 1898, Frank Sinatra in 1941 and '93, The Ink Spots (from Indianapolis) in '43, Johnny Cash in '57, Ray Charles in '61, Fats Domino in '64, the Velvet Underground (with Lou Reed) in '66, Sonny Bono (& Cher) in '67, Big Brother & the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin) in '68, B.B.

The event was very popular & was the first step in creating the city-wide projection mapping event called Blink.https://cincymusic.com/blog/2019/09/blink-entertainment- lineup = 2016-2017 Renovation = In 2016, Cincinnati Music Hall was closed for a 14-month, $143 million renovation. The renovation included the addition of 30,000 additional square feet of usable space, as well as the structural and cosmetic renovation of the buildings traditional performance and event spaces. Approximately half of the renovations funding was provided by private donors, while the other half came from public funding sources such as the City of Cincinnati and tax credits from the State of Ohio. The space officially opened to the public October 6‚Äì7, 2017 with a weekend of performances and all access tours of the building. Paranormal Various employees of Music Hall have described experiencing strange events in the facility, while others say they've never experienced anything at all. In the 2005 documentary Music Hall: Cincinnati Finds Its Voice, Patricia K. Beggs, the CEO of the Cincinnati Opera, acknowledged, \\"Ghosts? Um, yes. Indeed, there are Music Hall ghosts.\\" Erich Kunzel, late conductor for the Cincinnati Pops, once stated, \\"Sometimes when I was arranging, getting things together, I've worked here all night long. So I've met these people. They're not in the offices, but when you go out into the house they're there, they're upstairs. ... If you think I'm crazy just come here sometime at three o'clock in the morning. They're very friendly.\\" Ghosts were first reported before Music Hall was built, after the ground was first excavated for an Exposition Hall elevator. Neither Marie Gallagher, who worked at Music Hall for 25 years, nor Ed Vignale, facilities engineer, have experienced anything unusual at Music Hall. Viganle noted that some strange sounds could be attributed to Music Hall's acoustical ability to project sounds. Music Hall was selected as one of The Travel Channel's Most Terrifying Places in America and for the SYFY TV show Ghost Hunters.

He served as the second president of Randolph‚ÄìMacon College in Ashland, Virginia, from 1836 to 1846; then professor from 1847 to 1855, and then third president of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from 1855 to 1867; and first chancellor of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1875 to 1893. He was an apologist for slavery in the United States before the Civil War, but afterward became a vociferous spokesperson against slavery when it became possible to do so. Early life Landon Garland was born March 21, 1810, in Nelson County, Virginia. He graduated with first honors from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in 1829. His older brother, Hugh A. Garland, who was one of the lawyers involved in the Dred Scott case and author of a biography of John Randolph of Roanoke, was also a Hampden-Sydney graduate. Their parents were Alexander Spotswood Garland and Lucinda Rose. Confederate Army General Samuel Garland, Jr. was the son of his only sister, Caroline Garland (1807-1901), and United States Founding Father and fourth President of the United States James Madison was his great uncle. Career Garland taught chemistry and natural philosophy at Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, from 1829 to 1830. Garland taught chemistry and natural history at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, from 1833 to 1834, eventually being elected chair of the department. From 1836 to 1846, he served as the second president of Randolph-Macon College. Garland moved to the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1847, where he taught English literature, rhetoric, and history. He served as its third president from 1857 to 1867 (the university campus was destroyed in the last days of the Civil War in the spring of 1865). Concerned about a lack of discipline among students, he tried to turn it into a military institution. At the end of the American Civil War of 1861-1865; the University of Alabama campus was burned to the ground by Union cavalry forces in the same week in 1865 that the Civil War was effectively ended by Johnson's surrender in South Carolina of the southern command's Confederacy forces. After a year of trying to rebuild the university, Garland's dream of making it an institution of discipline and honor (a central theme of the historical south) died along with the Confederacy. Only a single student enrolled for classes in 1866; Garland resigned and accepted the chair of philosophy and astronomy at the University of Mississippi in 1867. There, Methodist Bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire (1824‚Äì1889) sought out his former teacher and enlisted him in the campaign to build a Methodist university in Nashville, Tennessee. Garland, a highly respected academic in Southern education and in Methodism, wrote essay after essay in church publications on the need for an \\"educated ministry\\". With Garland on board, the bishop now needed the money, and for that he turned to Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt. Garland became chancellor of Vanderbilt University in 1875. Garland had definite ideas about the rules that would govern the university's place in this world. Under Garland's plan, Vanderbilt would have four departments: Biblical Studies and Literature, Science and Philosophy, Law, and Medical. Though Bishop McTyeire usually was there looking over his shoulder, Chancellor Garland clearly set the mood of the campus. Steeped in Scottish moral philosophy, he believed that the development of character was the central purpose of a true university. He did his part to mold character each Wednesday when he preached sermons to the student body in chapel, and he was staunch in his opposition to dormitories, claiming they were \\"injurious to both morals and manners.\\" In the early days, the closest thing to campus radicals were the law students. In fact, the law students provided the first challenge to the chancellor over the concept of an open forum. Garland had invited John Sherman (1823‚Äì1900), brother of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (1820‚Äì1891), to address the students in chapel. For the law students, it was more than they could bear to sit through a speech by the brother of the Yankee general who had burned a wide swath from Atlanta to the sea. The law students held a protest meeting, then marched single file out of the building, some playing Dixie on their harmonicas. In 1889, Bishop McTyeire died. Two years later, in 1891, Garland tendered his resignation to the board of trustees, but they kept it in abeyance until 1893 when the board named James Hampton Kirkland (1798-1868) as chancellor. Views on slavery Garland owned \\"up to 60 slaves\\" before the Civil War; the first few were given to his bride and him by their parents as marriage gifts. Later, he purchased slaves as families (to keep them together), but also as source of income by then renting them as house servants to others (to also keep them relatively safe). Moreover, \\"he claimed that he did not own them as property, but he instead owned their labor.\\" In this \\"ownership\\" claim, he was trying to make the distinction between \\"owning the person and owning their work product\\" since he was in a region of the country where outspoken opposition to ownership slavery was a death sentence. This was also his actual practice. He attempted, subtly, to make this point many times, including in an 1860 lecture at the University of Alabama, where he said, \\"The negro has, through slavery, been taken up from a condition of grossest barbarity and ignorance, made serviceable to himself and to the world, and elevated and improved socially, morally, intellectually, and physically.\\" and as such , could provide acceptable work that could generate value to the slave and to their \\"work owner\\" (and were not just animals, but who instead could be taught to read, write, and do tasks of worth). After the Civil War, when it became possible to do so, he became an outspoken opponent to ownership slavery through his Methodist Church channels of communications, including many documented sermons on the evils of ownership slavery. Personal life Garland was married to Louisa Frances (1812-1889). They had several children, including: *Annie Rose Garland Fulton (1843-1893: She married Robert Burwell Fulton (1849-1919), who served as the seventh chancellor of the University of Mississippi from 1892 to 1906; they had two sons and one daughter who died in infancy and one son who survived: Landon Garland Fulton (1872-1874) Louise Garland Fulton (1873-1874) Robert Garland Fulton (1875-1877) Maurice Garland Fulton (1877‚Äì1955; professor of English and history at New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico) *maybe Carrie Matilda Garland Thompson (1852-1880) *Alice Virginia Garland (1856-1872) *Lucinda Rose Garland Lewis: She married Burwell Boykin Lewis, Confederate cavalry officer, lawyer, and congressman from Alabama, who was also a president of the University of Alabama; they had seven daughters, including Bertha Lewis Miller, who married Hugh Barr Miller, and whose son, Hugh Barr Miller, Jr, is considered an important figure during WWII *Louise Frances Garland: She married Milton W. Humphreys (1844-1928), who had been recruited by Garland as the first professor of Greek and Latin at Vanderbilt University. Garland died on February 13, 1895, in Nashville. He was buried alongside Bishops McTyeire, Joshua Soule (1781‚Äì1867), and William McKendree (1757‚Äì1835) in a fenced grave in the Vanderbilt University Divinity Cemetery. Legacy Garland Hall on the campus of Vanderbilt University His papers, the Landon Cabell Garland Papers, 1830-1893, include correspondence, diaries, speeches, sermons, a report to the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust, and personal and biographical materials. The collection is small, only 1/3 of a cubic foot. These are personal papers of Chancellor Garland and are not to be confused with his university papers, which are housed in the University Archives. This collection provides a small snapshot of Chancellor Garland's personal life, with the family correspondence providing the main interest. Garland Hall on the Vanderbilt University campus is named in his honor. Also, Landon Cabell Garland Hall on the University of Alabama campus is named after him, as is a dorm at Randolph-Macon College. His portrait, painted by great- granddaughter Louise Lewis in 1907-1908, hangs in a family home in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Copies painted by Louise Lewis of the original hang in Kirkland Hall on the Vanderbilt University campus and in the archives of the University of Alabama.

He was an aggressive middle order batsman, who captained Mysore for some years, and a useful leg-spin bowler. He later emigrated to Australia. Subramanya was affectionately called as 'Kunju (small) Mani'. Early life Subramanya grew up in a joint family in Malleswaram. His father was a civil engineer who built a lot of houses in Bangalore. His uncle was the chief engineer when the KRS Dam was built. They had a house with a huge compound where all the cousins could play cricket. Two of Subramanya's brothers, V. Ramdas and V. Krishnaprasad also played for Mysore.Vedam Jaishankar, Casting a Spell, The story of Karnataka Cricket, UBS Publishers, 2005 Subramanya studied at the Malleswaram High School and later Basappa Intermediate College before graduating from Central College. He turned out for Malleswaram Gymkhana. Unlike other cities at that time, Bombay and Madras, Bangalore did not have a major tournament. The only exposure that the youngsters got was from radio. Subramanya learnt cricket by listening to commentary and imbibing some lessons. Ranji career Despite being an accomplished batsman, Subramanya made his Ranji Trophy debut against Hyderabad batting at number 10. He explained this by saying ‚Äì \\"A.S. Krishnaswamy was the captain. He had already returned to Mysore city and was out of touch with the Bangaloreans. I felt frustrated on my debut. ASK did not know the players and what they did. In my debut match I went in at number 10. ASK did not know who I was and also did not bother to find out.\\"Scorecard of Hyderabad vs Karnataka Mysore made the final that year, but they had a new skipper. Kennimbeli Vasudevamurthy was made captain of the team and he promoted Subramanya higher up in the order. The game against Bombay took place at the Brabourne Stadium. Subramanya excelled with a fine century. Despite his efforts, Mysore lost the game by an innings and 22 runs.Scorecard of the 1959/60 Ranji Trophy Final Subramanya built on his success in his debut season and scored more runs in the following seasons. He was appointed as captain of the Mysore team in 1963. In his first season as captain, he led his team to a semi-final showdown against Bombay at Central College Ground in Bangalore. His excessive shielding of his tail end partners cost him his century as he was dismissed for 99 by Subhash Gupte.Scorecard of Bombay vs Karnataka Subramanya had a sensational Duleep Trophy by scoring hundreds against North Zone and West Zone.Scorecard of North Zone vs South Zone He was thus selected to the Indian cricket team. International career Subramanya played with moderate success in the few Tests that he played between 1965 and 1968. Against West Indies at Madras in 1966‚Äì67, he hit a breezy 61, treating Hall and Griffith with disdain.Scorecard of India vs West Indies He did little of note on the tour of England in 1967, but he touched form late and played in two of the three Tests. Pressed to open the attack because of injuries to the regular new ball bowlers, he bowled Geoff Boycott in the third Test at Edgbaston. On the tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1967‚Äì68, he did little of note, save for a fighting 75 in a losing cause in the first Test at Adelaide.Scorecard of India vs Australia Later career Subramanya later returned to play for the Mysore team. His greatest contribution to Karnataka Cricket was as a leader. Under his leadership, talented cricketers like B. S. Chandrasekhar, Gundappa Vishwanath, EAS Prasanna, Syed Kirmani made their debuts and were given extended runs. He inculcated a sense of team spirit that lacking earlier. He broke down club cricket loyalties and inspired the cricketers to play for Mysore. Subramanya was considered ahead of his time. At a time, when fielding drills were non- existent, he introduced physical training in the form of jogging, stretching, cross-training and intense fielding practices. He fought with the administrators for better practice facilities at the RSI grounds in Bangalore. He insisted on a proper diet for the cricketers. Since the game was not paying well, Subramanya decided to emigrate to Australia. Legacy Subramanya's contribution to Karnataka cricket was felt after he left the game. Brijesh Patel believed that Mysore could have won the Ranji Trophy much earlier if Subramanya had stayed back to guide the team. Gundappa Vishwanath said ‚Äì \\"The 1974 team that won the Ranji Trophy was Mani's (Subramanya) team.

He√∞in Br√∫ is considered to be the most important Faroese writer of his generation and is known for his fresh and ironic style. His novel, Fe√∞gar √° fer√∞ (The Old Man and His Sons), was chosen as the Book of the twentieth century by the Faroese. Life and Works Like many of his countrymen, Jacobsen worked as a fisherman in his early years. After two seasons, he left to study agriculture in Denmark. When he returned to the Faroes, he worked as an agricultural advisora job that took him to all parts of the country. The contacts he made with ordinary village people he met during this time had a lasting effect on his writing. In 1930, his first novel, Lognbr√°, which tells the story of a young man growing up in a Faroese village, was published. In 1935 there appeared its sequel, Fastat√∏kur, in which the young man works as a fisherman on a sloop. Both of these books were translated into Danish in 1946 and published under the title H√∏gni. Fe√∞gar √° fer√∞, Br√∫'s most famous work, was published in Faroese in 1940, in Danish in 1962 (Fattigmands√¶re), in German in 1966 (Des armen Mannes Ehre, a translation of the Danish title), and in English in 1970 under the title of The Old Man and his Sons. This was his first novel to be translated from Faroese into English. It tells the tale of the transformation of a rural society into a modern nation of fisheries and the conflicts between generations that result. In 1963, he satirised the Faroese politics of the interwar period in his novel Leikum fagurt. His Men livi√∞ l√¶r (1970) describes a Faroese village around 1800, and his Ta√∞ st√≥ra taki√∞ of 1972 describes a similar village around a century later. While writing these novels, He√∞in Br√∫ also wrote three collections of novellas and translated two Shakespeare plays (Hamlet and The Tempest).

The character was adapted from Magne, a character in Norse mythology, by Dan Jurgens. The character exists in an alternate future in which Thor rules over the entire Earth. Fictional character biography Magni was born into a tumultuous New Asgard around the year 2020 to Thor and Amora the Enchantress. While he was still just an infant, Magni's life was threatened by Balder's betrayal during the human resistance's raid led by Captain America. While Thor fought the resistance fighters, Balder got a hold of Magni and threatened to kill him if Thor didn't stop his subjugation of humanity. Magni's adoptive uncle Loki saved his life by killing Balder. Thor, no longer restrained by fear for his son's life, killed all of the remaining intruders himself. Magni grew up to be much like his father, both in personality and appearance (though his hair was red, unlike his father's blond). While Thor oversaw matters from New Asgard's throne, in fact, Magni often traveled through the kingdom helping humans in danger, much as Thor had done as a superhero. Although Magni loved his father dearly, he often disagreed with the way he allowed Loki to treat the humans under his rule. He still followed his father out of loyalty, however. That began to change when Magni met and befriended Jordahl, a mortal girl whom Thialfi had rescued upon arriving in the year 2170. Jordahl bumped into Magni while on the run from Loki's security forces; after dismissing the guards, Magni spent the day with Jordahl. Through her Magni caught a glimpse of what the humans thought of his father's regime. He was disturbed to find that many of the humans feared the gods and even more disturbed to find that their fear was warranted as, a short time later, he joined the Warriors Three and Thialfi on a mission to quell a rebellion in one of the villages. Magni was shocked and outraged at the Warriors Three's conduct as they began brutally murdering humans without even trying to find a peaceful solution. He ordered the Warriors to lay down their weapons just as one of the villagers revealed himself to be a fanatical suicide bomber. Magni rushed to smother the blast of the bomber's explosive vest and succeeded, but the events he witnessed would trouble him greatly. Afterwards Thialfiwho had already become convinced that Thor and the Asgardians needed to leave Earth by Mistress Kyaconfronted Magni and urged him to see the error of his father's ways. Magni accused Thialfi of treason but showed the extent of his doubts when he did not strike Thialfi down or report him for it. Magni leaves Thialfi and goes to visit Jordahl, only to find her house in ruins and a witness claiming that Magni himself had destroyed the house and had Jordahl taken to a reconditioning camp. Magni quickly realized that Loki had impersonated him using his magic and rushed to the reconditioning camp. He found Jordahl and destroyed the camp, and his doubts about the righteousness of New Asgard grew much deeper. Magni went to see Sif, whom Thor had banished from New Asgard years earlier, for advice. She told him about Thor's past as a noble hero while Asgard was still at its peak under Odin. Then she told him about the day Asgard fell, the same day she was banished from New Asgard. She revealed that her crime was daring to oppose Thor, Amora, and Loki in their plans for domination of Earth. Magni left Sif and returned to the royal palace, where he received word of Thialfi and Kya's failed assassination attempt on Thor. He witnessed the beginning of Kya's execution and would have tried to rescue her, but she used magic to speak to him telepathically and told him not to. After Kya's body was killed her soul led Magni to Mjolnir. He found himself able to pick the hammer up and, after learning to use it partly by instinct and partly under Sif's tutelage, he returned to the royal palace intending to test his father's purity of heart‚Äîif Thor could lift the hammer, Magni reasoned, his rule must be just and his actions righteous; if not, Magni considered that he may have to fight his father himself. When he challenged Thor to lift Mjolnir, however, Thor stalled, well aware that his murder of Jake Olson over 150 years earlier had rendered him unworthy. While Magni and Thor argued, Desak the god-slayer returned. After a pitched battle in which Magni was critically injured and several other gods were killed, Thor found himself able to lift Mjolnir again thanks to his pure intentions to defend his family and undo the wrongs Loki had done. Thor killed Desak and used the Odinforce to freeze time. He wished Magni a heartfelt farewell and promised he would never forget him, then returned to the past. With Tarene's help, he warned his younger self to ensure that the future he had experienced would never come about. Magni, along with everything after that branching point, ceased to exist. Powers and abilities Magni was an Asgardian whose incredibly dense body granted him a high resistance to injury. His Asgardian physiology granted him great stamina, quick reflexes, an extremely long life span, and immunity to all Earthly diseases, toxins, and some magic. Magni's position as the Norse god of strength granted him superhuman strength even greater than that of his father Thor (he effortlessly lifted and dropped a tower on Desak). As prince of New Asgard and a warrior in its service, Magni received training in the Asgardian arts of war granting him a high degree of proficiency in armed and unarmed combat. Weapons and equipment Magni wore a suit of Asgardian armor similar to the one his father Thor wore during his early days as lord of Asgard. Magni occasionally used one of New Asgard's many winged horses for transportation. Magni gained possession of his father's legendary uru hammer Mjolnir, which had several enchantments. Magni demonstrated the ability to throw the hammer and have it magically return to him, fly by throwing it and holding onto its leather thong, and create dimensional portals. Upon gaining Mjolnir, Magni discovered that he instinctively knew how to use it for basic things. The lady Sif instructed him on how to traverse dimensions with it. Still, his proficiency with the hammer may be assumed to be far less than his father's. Before gaining Mjolnir, Magni favored various types of axes in combat.

This flag was in use officially until 10 January 1820. =Second flag= On 10 January 1820, the Department of Cundinamarca, one of the three official departments of the republic, adopted arms of its own alleging that the arms of the republic were only used in Venezuela.

He was Martin Bormann's father-in-law. After the end of the Second World War in Europe, Buch was classified as a major regime functionary or \\"Hauptschuldiger\\" in the denazification proceedings in 1949. On 12 November of that year, he committed suicide. Early life and career Born in Bruchsal, the son of a Senate President at the Baden High Court, Buch became a soldier in the First World War as a career officer. In 1918, he was released from the army as a major and then busied himself in the Baden Veterans' League. From 1919 to 1922 he was a member of the German National People's Party (DNVP/Deutschnationale Volkspartei). By 1922, he had become a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and in August 1923 he was leader of the SA in Franconia. In mid 1923, after Hermann Ehrhardt on the one side and Ernst R√∂hm and Adolf Hitler on the other had fallen out with each other, the Sto√ütrupp- Hitler (\\"Shock Troop-Hitler\\") was formed out of eight SA members for Hitler's protection. The Sto√ütrupp was run by two former members of the Stabswache (\\"Staff Guard\\") who had also once belonged to the Brigade Ehrhardt. Julius Schreck founded the unit and the SS forerunner organization never numbered more than 20 members which included Buch. He thus found himself tied into the later SS and over time became an Honorary Leader of the SS (\\"Ehrenf√ºhrer der SS \\") with the rank of Obergruppenf√ºhrer (under a new rank system brought in 1938, this became Stab Reichsf√ºhrer SS). After the Beer Hall Putsch failed on 9 November 1923, many SA leaders fled the country. Buch came back to Munich as early as 13 November, sent by Hermann G√∂ring ‚Äì who had fled to Innsbruck ‚Äì to ensure that the shaken Party troops' cohesion would not weaken. He also built up ties with the now outlawed SA groups, which could now only operate under cover. Buch maintained regular contact between Hitler, who was sitting in prison in Landsberg am Lech, and the illegal Party leadership in Austria. In the time that followed, when the NSDAP was banned, G√∂ring's earlier fears began to come true as the party broke up. After Hitler's release from Landsberg, the Party was reestablished on 20 February 1925. On 20 May 1928 Buch was elected from electoral constituency 24 (Upper Bavaria-Swabia) as one of the first 12 Nazi Party deputies to the Reichstag and would serve until 1945.Paul R. Bartrop & Eve E. Grimm: Perpetrating the Holocaust: Leaders, Enablers, and Collaborators, ABC-CLIO, 2019, p. 62. . In the time that followed, until the Nazis seized power in 1933, Buch continually strengthened his status. On 2 June 1933, he was appointed by Hitler as a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1933-1945 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1973, p.74. . Chief Justice of the Party Supreme Court The Inquiry and Mediation Board (Untersuchungs- und Schlichtungs-Ausschuss or USCHLA), whose chairman Buch became on 27 November 1927, was established. The two other USCHLA members at the time of Buch's becoming chairman were Hans Frank and Ulrich Graf, see William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (Simon & Schuster, 1960), p. 122. The USCHLA's headquarters were at the Braunes Haus (\\"Brown House\\") in Munich. Buch did not confine himself merely to rulings in internal Party disputes, but also had Party members monitored or put under pressure if they strayed from the Party line. The Board could render judgments freely within the country and without, against which there was no appeal, except to Hitler. On 2 September 1929, NSDAP member and later Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann married Walter Buch's daughter Gerda (born 23 October 1909 in Konstanz). Buch and Hitler were witnesses. In 1934, he described the importance of Party tribunals thus: > The Party tribunals always have themselves to consider as the iron fasteners > that hold together the proud building of the Nazi Party, which political > leaders and SA leaders have built up. Saving it from cracks and shocks is > the Party tribunals' grandest task. The Party magistrates are bound only to > their National Socialist conscience, and are no political leader's > subordinates, and they are subject only to the F√ºhrer. Buch acted quite like this. At the R√∂hm Putsch in 1934, he traveled at Hitler's behest to Bad Wiessee and was present at Ernst R√∂hm's arrest. By way of thanks for having given R√∂hm's murder the outward appearance of legality, Buch was made the supreme Party magistrate and an SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer on 9 November 1934. In 1936 it was claimed in an anonymous letter that Buch's wife was half-Jewish. In the course of a Gestapo investigation, it came to light that the letter had been written by Wilhelm Kube, whom Buch had investigated owing to concerns over his private life and his leadership style in the Gau of Kurmark. Buch saw to it that Kube was removed from all his posts. Only on Hitler's orders was Kube allowed to remain a Gauleiter, albeit without his own Gau. Buch was also responsible for the \\"legalization\\" of Party members' excesses during the so-called Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). He declared after his investigation that the \\"small Party comrades\\" who were responsible for more than a hundred Jews' deaths had only been following orders. However, he found no need to question those who had given these orders, such was his deep-seated Anti-Semitism, and he publicly brought the law for Jews into question. In his opinion, Jews were literally \\"not humans\\". Imprisonment and suicide After the end of the Second World War in Europe, Buch was seized and sentenced to five years in a labour camp. In July 1949, in the course of another wave of denazification, he was classified as a major regime functionary or \\"Hauptschuldiger\\". A few weeks after his release from prison, on 12 November 1949, he ended his own life by slitting his wrists and throwing himself into the Ammersee.

(Due to sparse observations, the system may have developed prior to this time, but was not detected.) The cyclone moved west- northwestward and quickly strengthened, becoming a hurricane late on June 16. It reached its peak intensity of early on June 17. Around 06:00 UTC on June 17, the hurricane made landfall southwest of Bay City, Texas, over the eastern end of East Matagorda Bay. Turning to the northwest after landfall, it quickly degenerated into a tropical storm, gradually turning northward over time. By 06:00 UTC on June 18, it weakened into a tropical depression, and just 12 hours later it lost its identity near Waco, Texas. In Texas, the cyclone produced heavy rain, peaking at over a 16-hour period at Galveston. The highest measured winds reached in the city. Along the coast of Texas, the lowest measured pressure was at Corpus Christi, about southwest of the landfall location. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the minimum central pressure in the storm was likely close to at the time of landfall. Operationally, the U.S. Signal Corps‚Äîpredecessor to the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service)‚Äîdid not classify the system as an area of low pressure, and as such, it did not appear in the June 1888 track map of cyclones in the Monthly Weather Review, the official publication of the Signal Corps. However, as early as June 17 the New York Times noted that a moderate storm was apparently approaching Texas. =Tropical Storm Two= The second tropical storm of the season originated about east of the mouth of the Rio Grande, on the Texas‚ÄìMexico border. It moved north-northwest, attaining its peak intensity of by 00:00 UTC on July 5. About 16 hours later, the moderate tropical storm made landfall at that intensity just east of Bay City‚Äîimpacting the same region as the previous storm. The cyclone turned north and north-northeast after striking land, slowly weakening as it did so. By 12:00 UTC on July 6, the cyclone was last positioned over northwestern Cherokee County, Texas. In Texas, the storm produced peak winds of in Galveston, and the lowest measured pressure was in the city. Like the preceding storm, the cyclone produced heavy rain over parts of Texas, especially in the Palestine area in Anderson County. In this area, a shower of pebbles, each ranging from in diameter and irregularly shaped, was reported to have occurred, possibly due to a tornado or waterspout that touched down at an unknown distance from Palestine. =Hurricane Three= Detection The Miami- Louisiana Hurricane of 1888, the third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season was first detected by 12:00 UTC on August 14, while centered about north-northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. (Operationally, the U.S. Signal Corps did not begin tracking the system until August 16, when it was first observed off South Florida.) Landfall and development Moving west- northwestward, the tropical storm steadily intensified into a hurricane 24 hours later on August 15. It made landfall on Cat Island in The Bahamas, which were then a British crown colony and overseas territory. Continuing to intensify, the hurricane passed just south of the Bahamian capital Nassau, on New Providence Island, around 00:00 UTC on August 16 with winds of . The cyclone, continuing to the west-northwest, then made another landfall on the northern end of Andros Island. As it neared the southeast coast of Florida, it strengthened into the equivalence of a major hurricane‚ÄîCategory 3 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale‚Äîand attained peak winds of , near the upper threshold of Category 3 intensity, by 12:00 UTC on August 16. About seven hours later, it made landfall just north of present-day Miami Beach at peak intensity. (This location was near present-day Upper Eastside in Miami.) The cyclone weakened as it moved inland over the Everglades, south of Lake Okeechobee, and by 06:00 UTC on August 17 passed out into the Gulf of Mexico near Matlacha and Cayo Costa. By that time maximum sustained winds had decreased to . By 18:00 UTC on August 17, however, the cyclone regained intensity, and its path turned westward over the Gulf of Mexico. Early on August 18, the hurricane attained a second peak intensity of . In the time before landfall in Louisiana, its path gradually bent to the northwest and north-northwest. Around 16:00 UTC on August 19, the cyclone made landfall south of Cocodrie, Louisiana, as the equivalence of a strong Category 2 hurricane. Turning northward after moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a strong tropical storm by 18:00 UTC on August 20, its path nearing Greenville, Mississippi, before curving to the northeast. Little more than a day later, it passed over southern New England, becoming extratropical by 12:00 UTC on August 22. Damage caused As it passed over The Bahamas, the hurricane caused damage to fruit trees, crops, and fences, especially on the Abaco Islands, Harbour Island, and New Providence. Winds shifted from northeast and southwest, lasting about eight hours, but damage to shipping was minimal. In South Florida, the hurricane struck a sparsely-populated section of the coast, but still produced widespread damage as far north as Sebastian. The highest wind reported in South Florida was at Jupiter, and the heaviest rainfall was at that location. Farther north along the coast, winds at Sebastian Inlet were estimated at , downing trees and telegraph poles; many small boats were pushed ashore, and \\"several thousand dollars\\" in damage were reported to local fruit groves. Additionally, the hurricane reportedly produced a storm surge of \\"on the beaches near Miami.\\" In the Big Bend region of Florida, winds at Cedar Key reached , accompanied by light rain, and caused several yachts to capsize. Winds at Pensacola, in the Florida Panhandle, peaked at , badly damaging local property. Winds in Mobile, Alabama, peaked at , prostrating trees and fences, and a few homes lost their roofs. Flooding from the storm surge was among the worst on record: the waterfront was flooded to a depth of , with floodwater extending two to three blocks inland from the Mobile River. Along the Mississippi River Delta, the storm produced severe flooding. Rainfall in New Orleans totaled over a 12-hour period, and winds in the city reached an estimated ; in the city strong winds unroofed many buildings, downed numerous trees, and blew down fences. In many areas, strong winds downed at least one- third of the timber, and damage to rice, sugarcane, corn, and cotton crops was significant. The lowest reported pressure in the Mississippi Delta was at Vicksburg, Mississippi, with other readings as low as in the Memphis area. The storm produced heavy rainfall and high winds along much of its path across the Mississippi Valley, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the Northeastern United States. =Hurricane Four= Hurricane San Gil of 1888 On August 31, a tropical storm was observed northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It moved westward, strengthening to a hurricane later that day. As it continued to strengthen, it brought heavy rain over Puerto Rico, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Cuba. The hurricane passed Puerto Rico far off land but brought heavy rains that caused major flooding and over 100 deaths due to river flooding (similar to Hurricane Donna in 1960). On the 3rd, it reached its peak of 130 mph, but land interaction with Cuba weakened it to a minimal hurricane. It crossed the island and the Yucat√°n Channel, reaching the northeast coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on the 6th. After weakening to a tropical storm, it restrengthened to a Category 2 hurricane while moving southwestward in the Bay of Campeche, but it dissipated after its Veracruz landfall on the 8th. It caused 921 deaths. =Tropical Storm Five= A tropical storm formed north of the Turks & Caicos Islands on September 6. It travelled north through the Florida Panhandle and continued northward along the east coast of the US. The storm reached Maryland before becoming extratropical on September 11. The system dissipated near Ottawa on September 13. Across the United States, the storm deposited heavy rainfall from Florida through eastern Georgia through the Carolinas into southern Virginia. The heaviest total reported was at Greenwood, South Carolina. =Hurricane Six= A tropical storm formed south of Key West on September 23 and began moving northeast. It travelled parallel to the coast of Georgia, where it produced winds of before becoming a Category 1 hurricane on September 26. It continued heading northeastward before it became extratropical on September 27 near the Gulf of St Lawrence. =Hurricane Seven= Hurricane seven developed on October 8 in the southern Gulf of Mexico. It moved slowly northeastward and strengthened to a category 2 hurricane with 110 mph winds as it made landfall on northwestern Florida. The system then moved up the east coast, while weakening to a tropical storm. This system had a pressure of 970 millibar at one point. =Tropical Storm Eight= Tropical storm eight formed close to the Windward Islands on November 1 and moved northward into the north Atlantic, while strengthening to 50 knots. =Hurricane Nine= The Spanish brig Concha Ballester immediately after the passing of the vortex of a cyclone, on November 23, 1888 at 4 pm A tropical storm formed north-east of Puerto Rico on November 17. By the morning of November 23, it had developed into a Category 2 hurricane, reaching wind speeds of 100 mph (155 km/h). It maintained that level of intensity throughout the 23rd, 24th and 25 November before weakening to become extratropical on November 26. As an extratropical storm it was active until December 2.

He worked behind the camera on low-budget films of the 1950s, hit television series in the 1960s, and comedies, dramas, and made-for-TV movies in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1953, Nicholson, along with his two sons and three other partners, created the company Panavision. While working as an administrator there, he was able to take occasional quick jobs as a cameraman. He was eventually forced out of Panavision in 1960, and devoted the rest of his career to filming. Nicholson's first job as cinematographer was working for his friend Richard Cunha on Cunha's second film She Demons in 1958. This was followed by work on Cunha‚Äôs Frankenstein's Daughter (also in 1958), and Missile to the Moon in 1959. Nicholson is credited with achieving amazing results on these films, despite severe budget and time limitations. Each of these films was shot in eight days or fewer. This allowed time for Nicholson to also work on the film The Decks Ran Red at MGM. After leaving Panavision, Nicholson joined the production crew of the television series My Three Sons. He also was the cinematographer on the television series The Blue Angels and two films by Edgar Ulmer, Beyond the Time Barrier and The Amazing Transparent Man. He later worked on the more obscure films Dangerous Charter, The Devil's Hand, and Escape from Hell Island. Nicholson‚Äôs work after these films was exclusively in television.

This is the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was a very active year, with ten hurricanes, seven of which struck the United States, an event that would not occur again until 99 years later. Four hurricanes became major hurricanes (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote- sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the known 1886 cyclones, Hurricane Seven and Tropical Storm Eleven were first documented in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz. They also proposed large alterations to the known tracks of several other 1886 storms.Partagas, J.F. and H.F.

The season was approximately average, featuring 12 tropical storms compared to the 1981‚Äì2010 annual average of 12.1. The number of hurricanes, however, was well above average, with 10 forming compared to the annual average of 6.4. The number of major hurricanes‚Äîdefined as Category 3 or higher on the modern Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale‚Äîwas four, compared to an average of 2.7. Owing to deficiencies in surface weather observations at the time, the total number of tropical storms in 1886 was likely higher than 12. A 2008 study indicated that about three storms may have been missed by observational records due to scarce marine traffic over the open Atlantic Ocean. All but two of the storms in 1886 affected land at some point in the tropical stages of their life cycles. Of these, four hurricanes struck the island of Cuba, a record unsurpassed in any Atlantic hurricane season since then. According to the Cuban Meteorological Society, 1886 coincided with a highly active period, 1837‚Äì1910, in which one hurricane struck the island every 9.25 years. Additionally, seven hurricanes made landfall in the United States, establishing a record for the number of hurricane strikes in a single season. The years 1886‚Äì1887 featured 11 U.S. hurricane landfalls, setting a record for consecutive seasons until 2004‚Äì2005, when 12 such storms hit the country. Hurricane activity centered on the Gulf of Mexico: all seven landfalls in 1886 occurred on the U.S. Gulf Coast, with no hurricanes making landfall along the Atlantic Seaboard. Corpses in Johnson Bayou, Louisiana, following the October hurricane Although other storms may have gone undetected, tropical activity definitely began by the middle of June with the formation of the first named storm over the western Gulf of Mexico on June 13\\\\. Two other storms formed before the end of the month and also reached the Gulf of Mexico. The first three storms of the season each attained hurricane intensity and eventually made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). A mid- July storm that formed over the western Caribbean Sea moved northward and struck the west coast of Florida as a hurricane, after two earlier, stronger storms had already done so. Never before or since have so many hurricanes struck Florida in the same season before the month of August. Three storms, all of which attained major hurricane intensity, formed in close succession, over a span of eight days, in August. The first of these, the Indianola hurricane, was the strongest and most intense tropical cyclone of the season, striking multiple islands in the Greater Antilles before rapidly strengthening over the western Gulf of Mexico. It struck the U.S. state of Texas on August 20 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), making it one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit the state. September was a less active month than August, featuring two hurricanes on and just after mid-month. The final hurricane of the year formed in early October and struck Louisiana with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Two additional tropical storms occurred in October, with no further activity confirmed afterward. Systems=Hurricane One= Early in June, unsettled weather prevailed over the western Caribbean Sea, causing heavy rain and strong winds over Jamaica as early as June 7‚Äì8. However, ship reports and data from weather stations first confirmed that a low-pressure area formed off the coast of South Texas. Based on the data, HURDAT analyzed that a tropical storm formed about 140 miles (225 km) east-southeast of La Pesca, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, on the morning of June 13\\\\. Moving generally northward at first, the cyclone quickly intensified through the day as it gradually turned to the north-northeast, paralleling the Texas coast. By 06:00 UTC on June 14, the cyclone already attained hurricane status, and its parabolic path increasingly bent to the northeast. Around 16:00 UTC, the cyclone attained its peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category 2 hurricane, and made landfall just east of High Island, Texas. The cyclone rapidly weakened as it headed inland to the east-northeast, crossing south-central Louisiana as a tropical storm on June 15\\\\. Reanalysis in the 1990s determined that it dissipated about 20 miles (30 km) east- southeast of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, by 18:00 UTC on June 15. As it passed just offshore, the hurricane produced strong winds from the east and northeast in Galveston, Texas, generating very high tides. Observers suggested that only the shifting of the winds prevented severe flooding, possibly the worst since a hurricane in 1875; even so, small boats sustained significant damage. Waterfront structures, a tramway, and a railroad were destroyed. Galveston recorded peak winds of 50 mph (81 km/h), and a barometer in town registered a minimum pressure of ; as these conditions were recorded outside the storm's radius of maximum wind, the cyclone was likely stronger. Upon making landfall, the hurricane brought a storm tide and major flooding to Sabine Pass and its environs. Numerous structures and wharves were destroyed by wind or water, and winds tore roofs from houses. Fruit trees in the area lost much of their fruit. Saltwater intrusion extended several miles inland, imperiling livestock for want of freshwater. Across the state border in adjourning Louisiana, widespread flooding occurred at Calcasieu Pass, where a barge stranded and schooners were wrecked. Half of the corn crop in southwest Louisiana was damaged. While losing intensity so rapidly after landfall that forecasters lost track of it, the storm generated prolific rainfall in its path across Southeast Texas and Louisiana, peaking at in Alexandria, Louisiana. =Hurricane Two= Little more than a day after the dissipation of the previous hurricane, a broad area of low pressure over the western Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical storm while centered about 180 miles (290 km) east-southeast of Punta Allen, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Over the next two days, the storm meandered toward and through the Yucat√°n Channel, gradually intensifying as it proceeded to the north-northwest and north. Late on June 18, the system attained hurricane status off the western tip of Pinar del R√≠o Province, Cuba. The following day, the cyclone turned to the north-northeast, producing \\"severe gales\\" (47‚Äì54 mph, 76‚Äì87 km/h) over the waters off Cuba and Jamaica, as reported by ships. At 00:00 UTC on June 20, the storm reached its peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h), and shortly afterward its forward speed accelerated. At 11:00 UTC on June 21, the cyclone made landfall a short distance east of St. Marks, Florida, as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm gradually decreased in intensity over the next day and a half as it crossed the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. By 18:00 UTC on June 23, the system passed about 70 miles (115 km) southeast of New York City and curved to the east before dissipating a day later. Over a six-day period, a long duration of heavy rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding over parts of western Cuba, killing an undetermined number of people in flash floods. Winds over the island were apparently modest, however, though the rain over Vuelta Abajo was the heaviest over a one-week span in 29 years. Several locations were underwater following the deluge. As it passed west of Key West, Florida, the cyclone produced strong southerly winds there. At Cedar Key, gusts of 75‚Äì90 mph (121‚Äì145 km/h) toppled trees, signage and communications wires, but caused little structural damage. Between there and Apalachicola, above-normal tides covered low-lying streets and pushed ships onshore. Heaviest damages were concentrated in and near Apalachicola and Tallahassee. The storm produced minimal effects in the Jacksonville area, as hurricane-force winds were confined to the west of the Gainesville‚ÄìLake City area. The strongest sustained winds measured in Florida were below hurricane force‚Äîonly 68 mph (109 km/h) at Cedar Key‚Äîbut \\"high tides\\" affected much of the coastline near the point of landfall. Outside Florida, heavy rains, peaking at , inundated streets in Lynchburg, Virginia, producing the then-wettest June on record at that place. A daily record for the month, , also occurred in Washington, D.C. In a 1949 report by meteorologist Grady Norton, the U.S. Weather Bureau‚Äîlater the National Weather Service‚Äîconsidered the storm a \\"Great Hurricane,\\" implying winds of at least 125 mph (200 km/h), though reassessments could find no evidence that the cyclone ever reached major hurricane status. =Hurricane Three= Closely following the dissipation of the previous storm, yet another tropical storm developed about 90 miles (145 km) west of Negril, Jamaica, at 12:00 UTC on June 27\\\\. The system quickly strengthened as it headed north- northwest, acquiring hurricane intensity early the next day. Sharply turning to the west-northwest, the cyclone continued to intensify, reaching its first peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h) at 18:00 UTC on June 28\\\\. Maintaining force, it struck Pinar del R√≠o Province, Cuba, later that day. On June 29, the cyclone weakened as it crossed western Cuba, but began restrengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico as its path turned northwestward. Early on June 30, the hurricane attained its second and strongest peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) as its path began curving to the north. Veering and accelerating to the northeast, the storm struck the Florida Panhandle near Indian Pass around 21:00 UTC that day. The cyclone weakened as it headed inland, losing its identity near Cedartown, Maryland, late on July 2\\\\. In Jamaica, \\"at least\\" 18 deaths were attributed to the effects of the storm, and a ship west of the island experienced hurricane-force winds. While described as being of only \\"moderate intensity,\\" the hurricane caused considerable damage to western Cuba, where homes were destroyed or lost their roofs and trees were prostrated; flooding was reportedly severe as well. Damage was concentrated in and near Bataban√≥ and across Pinar del R√≠o Province. Trece de la Coloma reported a minimum pressure of . Two drownings occurred when a ship capsized, and an unknown number of fatalities occurred on land in Cuba. In Florida, the eye of the cyclone passed over Apalachicola, which reported top winds of 70 mph (113 km/h). Homes in town lost their roofs, frame buildings collapsed, and several craft in the bay sank, killing some people. At Cedar Key, high tides undermined roadways, and winds of 47‚Äì54 mph (76‚Äì87 km/h) removed a warehouse from its foundation. Winds gusting to 80 mph (129 km/h) uprooted large trees and moved railroad cars in Tallahassee; one person perished in Jefferson County. \\"Considerable\\" destruction of crops occurred in parts of North Florida and adjacent Georgia. Farther north, in North Carolina, winds of 42‚Äì44 mph (68‚Äì71 km/h) affected Kitty Hawk and Fort Macon, respectively. Copious rains affected southeast Virginia over a two-day span, destroying railroad trestles and embankments. The James River crested above flood stage, flooding waterfront structures in Richmond and prompting evacuations. =Hurricane Four= After nearly two quiet weeks, the fourth tropical storm of the season developed about 105 miles (170 km) west-southwest of George Town, Cayman Islands, at 06:00 UTC on July 14\\\\. For two more days, the system drifted west- northwest, gradually strengthening. On July 16, the cyclone began turning to the northeast and accelerated. It reached hurricane status at 12:00 UTC on July 17 and passed just west of Cuba later that day. Its path then bent to the north-northeast, and early the next day, the storm attained its first peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) as its eye neared the west coast of the Florida peninsula. Around 01:00 UTC on July 19, the hurricane made landfall near Ozello, Florida, at that intensity. The storm soon lost hurricane status as it swiftly turned to the east-northeast, briskly crossing North Florida en route to the Atlantic Ocean. At 00:00 UTC on July 20, the storm recovered hurricane status while centered about 140 miles (225 km) south-southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and six hours later attained its second and strongest peak of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm acquired extratropical characteristics early on July 23, and after curving to the northeast over the far north Atlantic, it dissipated at 18:00 UTC on July 24\\\\. Although it bypassed the island to the west, the cyclone generated heavy rains over western Cuba throughout July 16‚Äì17, causing rivers to overflow their banks. An anemometer in Key West measured top winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) during the passage of the hurricane, with no damage to shipping in the harbor. A few schooners were forced to shelter in safe harbor overnight. Overall damage near the point of landfall in Florida was slight, as the area was thinly inhabited. Off the Atlantic coast of the Southeastern United States, the storm interrupted maritime traffic. Multiple ships in the path of the storm recorded hurricane- force winds; the lowest pressure reported dipped to . =Hurricane Five= The Indianola Hurricane of 1886 A tropical storm developed east of Trinidad and Tobago on August 12 and began moving northwestward. Originally it was thought the storm became a Category 1 hurricane the next day but re-analysis now shows it remained as a tropical storm until August 14. On the evening of August 15 it reached the island of Hispaniola. After crossing the south of that island as a Category 1 hurricane, it struck southeastern Cuba on August 16 as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm briefly weakened whilst over land and entered the Gulf of Mexico near Matanzas on August 18 as a Category 1 storm. As the hurricane crossed the Gulf of Mexico it strengthened further, first to a Category 2 then to a Category 3 cyclone. As it approached the coast of Texas, it had intensified to a 150 mph (240 km/h) Category 4 hurricane. On August 20, it made landfall as a category 4 hurricane at that strength with catastrophic results. At Indianola, Texas a storm surge of 15 feet overwhelmed the town. Every building in the town was either destroyed or left uninhabitable. When the Signal Office there was blown down, a fire started which took hold and destroyed several neighboring blocks. The village of Quintana, at the mouth of the Brazos River was also destroyed. At Houston the bayou rose between 5‚Äì6 feet on August 19\\\\. Bridges were overrun by flood water and trees blown over at Galveston. Offshore several ships were wrecked there. Since the town of Indianola was destroyed, it was abandoned and never rebuilt. After making landfall, the storm eventually dissipated on August 21 in the northwest corner of Texas. =Hurricane Six= The Cuba Hurricane of 1886 On August 15 a hurricane was seen 90 miles northeast of Barbados. On August 16 it passed over the island of Saint Vincent as Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane passed north of Grenada and continued westward towards the coast of Venezuela, bringing a heavy gale, and some damage, to Curacao before curving north. Around midnight on August 19 it hit Jamaica, still at Category 2 intensity. The island experienced winds of throughout August 19 and 20th. The hurricane approached the south coast of Cuba as a major Category 3 hurricane on August 21. It crossed Cuba over the central provence of Ciego de √Åvila before exiting the island near Moron on the north coast. The hurricane then passed over Nassau on the night of August 22\\\\. It quickly moved northeastward, and travelled parallel to the east coast of the United States, still at Category 2 intensity, before it weakened and dissipated south of Newfoundland on the August 27. Damage was extensive at several of the locations impacted by the hurricane and some fatalities occurred on St. Vincent, Jamaica and possibly Cuba. Throughout the south of St Vincent, damage was extensive with many injuries and some fatalities reported. Thousands of trees were blown down and 300 homes destroyed on the island. At Jamaica crops and plantations were destroyed and some ships wrecked in Kingston harbour. In Cuba hundreds of homes were blown down, many trees were uprooted and some areas flooded. In the Bahamas, several sailing ships were blown ashore, both at Nassau and at Andros and at the Berry Islands. =Hurricane Seven= A tropical storm formed west of Bermuda on August 20\\\\. It passed about 175 miles to the south of the island before turning northwestward. As the storm travelled north on August 21, it intensified to a Category 3 hurricane. It reached the area of Georges Bank at that intensity on August 22 and damaged several vessels there. On August 23 it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and became an extratropical storm on August 24 near the Grand Banks. =Hurricane Eight= A tropical storm formed north of Puerto Rico on September 16\\\\. It travelled west, passing north of Hispaniola on September 17 and crossing Cuba in the Las Tunas region on September 18\\\\. The next day the storm passed just south of Isla de la Juventud and continued westward before curving north into the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm travelled north, parallel to the east coast of Mexico, it intensified to a Category 2 hurricane. However, when it made landfall in Texas between Brownsville and Corpus Christi on September 23, it was more likely at Category 1 intensity. The hurricane quickly weakened and dissipated over Texas the next day. Landfall was accompanied by record amounts of rainfall. 26 inches fell at Brownsville between September 21 and 23rd. Two hundred houses were blown down there. Only five weeks after the devastation brought by Hurricane Five, Indianola was again flooded by rainwater and storm surge from Matagorda Bay. The remaining residents were evacuated. Following this storm the post office at Indianola was shut down, marking the official abandonment of the town. =Hurricane Nine= A tropical storm formed in the western Atlantic on September 22\\\\. Within two days it had grown to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The storm maintained this intensity for six days until September 30, when it weakened to first a Category 1 hurricane then to a tropical storm. The cyclone never made landfall but is known from several ship reports. Most notable are those from the bark Mary, which endured the storm from September 22 until the 28th, and that of the brigantine Pearl which, on the evening of September 25, recorded sightings of ball lighting and \\"St. Elmo's light at the yard-arms\\" during the storm. =Hurricane Ten= The Texas‚ÄìLouisiana Hurricane of 1886 A tropical storm was observed in the northwest Caribbean Sea on October 8\\\\. It moved to the northwest, reaching major hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico on October 11\\\\. Late on October 12, the hurricane made landfall as a category 3 hurricane near the border between Louisiana and Texas. It caused between 126-150 deaths in the East Texas area. due to the heavy rainfall and storm surge, with $250,000 in damage occurring. Port Eads, Louisiana and parts of New Orleans were reported to be flooded. Sabine Pass, Texas was all but destroyed. On the afternoon of October 12 wind speeds there reached and waves from the Gulf were 20 feet high. Most buildings in the town were destroyed and ten miles of railroad track damaged. Numerous vessels were washed miles inshore and wrecked. At Johnson Bayou, Louisiana most buildings in the town were destroyed, and many residents drowned, by the impact of a seven-foot storm surge which extended twenty miles inland. At least 196 people died as a result of the storm. =Tropical Storm Eleven= A tropical storm existed in the western Atlantic between October 10 and October 15\\\\. It reached a peak wind speed of throughout October 13 and 14. It is thought that the existence of this storm may have been responsible for the westward deviation taken by Hurricane Ten in the Gulf of Mexico on October 10. =Tropical Storm Twelve= Several ships reported a large, but weak, tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, south of Haiti on October 22. It is thought the storm had actually formed the previous day. After crossing Haiti on October 22 the storm continued moving northeastward into the Atlantic. The storm maintained a peak wind speed of 70 mph (110 km/h) throughout October 23 and 24. It weakened on October 25 and dissipated on October 26 in the mid- Atlantic.

This is the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. In 1885 there were two tropical storms and six hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. However, in the absence of modern satellite monitoring and remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. __TOC__ Season summary The Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) recognizes eight tropical cyclones for 1885 in the Atlantic basin; two were tropical storms and six were hurricanes. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Two, which hit Georgia as a Category 2 hurricane, causing 25 deaths. The first cyclone was a tropical storm that existed in the Atlantic between August 7 and August 13 without making landfall. From north of Puerto Rico, Hurricane Two struck the Bahamas but then remained offshore until making a landfall in South Carolina. The hurricane caused considerable damage throughout the Carolinas, Georgia and Maryland. Also in August, Tropical Storm Three formed in the Gulf of Mexico, before crossing Florida and dissipating off South Carolina. Hurricane Four also grew from a tropical storm that formed in the Gulf of Mexico. It brought high winds and flooding to towns along the Gulf coast. This storm also crossed over Florida into the Atlantic and eventually made another landfall at New Brunswick as an extratropical storm. Hurricane Five existed in the tropical Atlantic between September 18 and September 21, without making landfall. Hurricane Six formed as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico and reached hurricane strength off North Carolina a week later on October 2. The cyclone had impacted both Mississippi and Florida as it had travelled north. Hurricane Seven existed in the mid-Atlantic between September 26 and September 29. The last known cyclone of 1885 was Tropical Storm Eight which formed north of Cuba and impacted Florida. It travelled through the south-east United States and brought gales and flooding to the North Carolina coast.

It moved to the west, hitting the Bahamas. It paralleled the coast of Florida and Georgia, remaining offshore until its South Carolina landfall on the 25th as a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane passed across North Carolina just west of Wilmington and Hatteras. At Smithville (Southport) the anemometer was destroyed measuring a wind speed of 98 mph. The maximum wind speed was estimated at 125 mph. The hurricane weakened to a Category 1 hurricane as it accelerated to the northeast, but restrengthened to a 105 mph (169 km/h) Category 2 hurricane on the 27th. It became extratropical on August 28. The storm caused considerable damage at Wilmington, Smithville (Southport), Charleston and at Morehead City. The value of this damage was estimated at $1,790,000. Heavy rains and flooding were also seen across Maryland. At Ellicott City, Maryland lightning set fire to a residence causing damage worth $16,000. In total the hurricane caused 25 deaths. =Tropical Storm Three= A tropical storm formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on August 29\\\\. It moved quickly to the northeast, and made landfall on extreme southeastern Louisiana on the 30th as a 60 mph (97 km/h) tropical storm. After crossing Florida, the storm was last seen off the coast of South Carolina on August 31. =Hurricane Four= On September 17, a tropical storm developed in the western Gulf of Mexico near Veracruz, Mexico. It paralleled the Gulf of Mexico coastline to the northeast flooding coastal towns. Winds along the Texas coast at Indianola were reported at . After hitting southeastern Louisiana on September 21, the storm crossed Florida. Over the Western Atlantic, it strengthened to become a hurricane on the 22nd before becoming extratropical near its New Brunswick landfall on the 23rd. The storm brought flooding to Indianola and coastal flooding in the Galveston area. Four people died when a coal barge, the Orient, was cast adrift in the Gulf. =Hurricane Five= From September 18 to the 21st, a hurricane existed in the tropical Atlantic Ocean to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles, peaking at 80 mph (129 km/h) before never being seen again. =Hurricane Six= A tropical storm formed in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 24\\\\. It drifted northward, and hit southeastern Mississippi before turning eastward. It moved across the Florida panhandle and peninsula, and became a hurricane to the southeast of North Carolina on October 2\\\\. Its track after this point is unknown. =Hurricane Seven= A tropical storm in the central Atlantic Ocean moved northward in late September, reaching 90 mph (145 km/h) winds before dissipating. =Tropical Storm Eight= A tropical storm formed north of Cuba on October 10\\\\. It moved northward, and hit Florida as a strong tropical storm. It moved northeastward through the southeast United States, passing west of Jacksonville and later Savannah. It reached southwestern Virginia around midnight on October 12 and became extratropical on the 13th. Gales of 44-56 mph occurred along the North Carolina coast. High tides coincided with the storms passage and led to the waterfront at Smithville (Southport) being flooded.

Just east of Antwerp, Ohio was the Six Mile Reservoir of the Wabash and Erie Canal. The reservoir, about 2000 acres (8 km¬≤) in size, had been built in 1840 by damming and diking a creek. It was used to provide water for the canal. The Wabash Canal was completed in 1843 and the Miami and Erie Canal in 1845, but they only operated for about ten years before they started shutting down. The last canalboat on the Wabash canal made its last docking in 1874 in Huntington, Indiana, but other sections shut down years earlier. For instance, the section through Fort Wayne, Indiana had been sold in 1870, and filled in so the Pennsylvania Railroad could lay tracks. For twenty years, the reservoir provided little for area residents but a mosquito-breeding ground for the spread of \\"ague\\", a local term for what was later recognized as malaria. An effort had been made to have the State of Ohio abandon the reservoir, but the bill failed to pass. Local residents attempted to cut the dike and drain the reservoir one night in March 1887, but wet work in cold weather being what it is, they did an incomplete job. Governor Joseph B. Foraker issued a proclamation requiring the rioters to disperse, and ordered General Axline with several companies of militia to the site to protect the state's property and preserve the peace. When the militia arrived, however, there was nobody there. Residents of the county were in favor of draining the reservoir, and investigators were unable to discover who had damaged the reservoir. On the night of April 25, 1887, a band of some 200 men, residents of the county, proceeded to the lower end of the reservoir. They captured the guard and tended to his minor self-inflicted gunshot wounds; nobody else fired a shot. The band dynamited two locks, and spent the entire night cutting the dikes with pick and spade. Although this still did not entirely drain the reservoir, it was mortally wounded. The reservoir and canal were later abandoned by the state. The band attacking the reservoir wall carried a flag bearing the slogan, \\"No Compromise!\\" The seal of Paulding County, Ohio bears this motto today.

Keller, as pictured in the July 1929 issue of Science Wonder Stories. David Henry Keller (December 23, 1880 ‚Äì July 13, 1966) was an American writer who worked for pulp magazines in the mid-twentieth century, in the science fiction, fantasy and horror genres.E.F. Bleiler and Richard Bleiler Science Fiction: The Gernsback Years. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1998. (pp. 210-227) He was the first psychiatrist to write for the genre, and was most often published as David H. Keller, MD, but also known by the pseudonyms Monk Smith, Matthew Smith, Amy Worth, Henry Cecil, Cecilia Henry, and Jacobus Hubelaire. John Clute has written, \\"It is clear enough that Keller's conceptual inventiveness, and his cultural gloom, are worth more attention than they have received; it is also clear that he fatally scanted the actual craft of writing, and that therefore he is likely never to be fully appreciated.\\" Biography Keller was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1903. He served as a neuropsychiatrist in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World Wars I and II, and was the Assistant Superintendent of the Louisiana State Mental Hospital at Pineville until Huey Long's reforms removed him from his position in 1928. That same year, Keller would travel to New York City to meet with Hugo Gernsback, publisher of Amazing Stories, who had bought his first professionally published science fiction story, \\"The Revolt of the Pedestrians\\". Gernsback was impressed by Keller's quality of writing, unique insight, and ability to address sophisticated themes beyond the commonplace technological predictions or lurid alien encounters typically found in early pulp stories. He encouraged Keller's writing and would later call these distinctive short stories \\"Keller yarns\\".Brian Stableford, \\"David H. Keller\\", in Bleiler, E. F., ed. Science Fiction Writers. New York: Scribners, 1982 (pgs. 119-123). In 1929, Gernsback founded the magazine Science Wonder Stories and not only published Keller's work in the first issue, but listed him as an Associate Science Editor. It was this issue of Science Wonder Stories that introduced the term \\"science fiction\\" to the world. This began an intense writing period for Keller, but he was unable to support his family solely on a writer's income and set up a small private psychiatric practice out of his home in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. Keller became an early scholar of H.P. Lovecraft, publishing occasional works on Lovecraft from 1948 to 1965. Most notably he was the first to suggest, in 1948, the influential but erroneous idea that Lovecraft could have inherited syphilis from his parents. Lovecraft publisher Arkham House published many books in the fantasy and horror field including a small but steady number throughout the 1950s. Robert Weinberg has written that: \\"However, intense competition from the SF (science fiction) small presses as well as slow sales of certain titles put August Derleth in a precarious bind. Only a generous loan from Dr David H. Keller prevented Arkham from going bankrupt during a period of cash flow problems.\\" Robert Weinberg, \\"Science Fiction Specialty Publishers\\" in Hall, Hal W. (ed). Science Fiction Collections: Fantasy, Supernatural and Weird Tales. Haworth Press, 1983, p. 126Sam Moskowitz, \\"I Remember Derleth\\", Starship (Winter 1981), pp. 10-11 Robert Weinberg writes of Keller's book career: \\"Dr David H. Keller had been one of the most popular science fiction authors of the 1920s and 1930s. Thus it was not surprising that several small presses, composed mainly of fans who had begun reading science fiction during that time, chose a Keller book as their first publication. Unfortunately, Dr Keller was no longer a name that could sell books and the Avalon Publishing Company, New Era Publishers and NFFF all ceased publications after producing one book by Dr Keller.Robert Weinberg, \\"Science Fiction Specialty Publishers\\" in Hall, Hal W. (ed). Science Fiction Collections: Fantasy, Supernatural and Weird Tales. Haworth Press, 1983, p. 123 Style Keller's work often expressed strong right-wing views (Everett F. Bleiler claims he was \\"an ultra-conservative ideologically\\"), especially hostility to feminists and African-Americans. Keller's 1928 story \\"The Menace\\" revolves about a series of black plots to take over the United States; it has been described by Bleiler as \\"racially bigotted\\".Sam Moskowitz, \\"Rocket to Green Pastures\\" in Strange Horizons : the spectrum of science fiction, New York : Scribner, 1976. Keller has further been criticized for \\"his corrosive attitude toward both science and civilization,\\" \\"anti-feminist, racist tendencies\\" and occasional \\"sexual sadism.\\" John Clute writes that Keller was \\"deeply involved in the last capacity in World War One and its consequences, his work focusing on shell shock; he was one of relatively few American sf writers to have anything like the direct experience of War That Will End War that marked so many British authors, a fact that may help explain his abiding cultural pessimism, often expressed in stories where a thin, almost literal veneer of civilization is peeled off to reveal the excrescence within.\\" Keller wrote a number of horror and fantasy stories, which some critics regard as superior to his SF work.Brian Stableford. \\"Keller, David H.\\" in The A to Z of Fantasy Literature. Lanham, Md. Scarecrow Press, 2005. . (pg. 231) Most notable is his 1932 horror tale \\"The Thing In The Cellar\\". Keller also created a series of fantasy stories called the Tales of Cornwall sequence, about the Hubelaire family; these were influenced by James Branch Cabell.Keller, David H(Enry) in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997), p. 533. Keller also wrote some fantasy work inspired by his interest in Freudian psychology, including \\"The Golden Bough\\" (1934) and The Eternal Conflict (1939 in French;1949 English).

Critical response  John Clute describes Keller's early work: \\"The stories of Keller's early prime ‚Äì with their heavily foregrounded concepts and Inventions and with their endemic indifference to plausible narrative follow-through ‚Äì made him an ideal writer for Hugo Gernsback, who published most of his output during these years, as well as his first book, The Thought Projector (1929 chap), in the Science Fiction Series of pamphlets.\\" Examining a particularly famous story, Clute writes, \\"'The Revolt of the Pedestrians' may be the most remarkable of these, though certainly one of the strangest. It is one of the relatively few sf tales before around 1970 to treat the hypertrophy of automobile culture in the twentieth century as Dystopian; after centuries, 'automobilists' have become almost organically tied to their Pollution-emitting cars, have lost the use of their legs, and have made pedestrianism a fatal offense. After the leader of a band of pedestrians turns off all electricity, legless automobilists die helplessly in their millions; the description of the death of twenty million New Yorkers attempting to flee Manhattan is extremely vivid. In the end, two elite pedestrians meet and prepare to breed, far from any despicable City.\\" Bleiler described Keller as \\"a very poor technician\\" when it came to writing fiction. However, he also argued that Keller \\"occasionally wrote fable-like stories, detached from daily realities and surrogate science fiction realities, that were excellent\\". Bleiler also described \\"The Revolt of the Pedestrians\\" as \\"a powerful story, horrible at times, but imaginative and rigorous in logic\\". Despite being ignored in the US outside science-fiction and fantasy fandom, several French writers, including R√©gis Messac, praised Keller as a \\"major author\\".

The Spanish, led by Francisco de Melo, were victorious over the French under Antoine III de Gramont, Comte de Guiche. A Spanish army under Melo and Jean de Beck besieged and captured the fortified town of Lens and exploited its success by advancing on the nearby fortress of La Bassee. Henri, Count of Harcourt, commanding the French in army in Picardy and Antoine III de Gramont, commander of Champagne, moved to relieve the town. Melo took 10,000 men, including 7,000 infantry in 12 regiments, from his army to intercept them. In the battle the French Champagne army took heavy casualties, losing 40% of its strength. 1,200‚Äì2,000 killed and wounded and 2,500‚Äì3,000 men and 10 guns captured, leaving Northern France wide open for the Spanish army. But the Spanish victory was not exploited because Francisco de Melo decided to be cautious. One year later De Melo lost the historic Battle of Rocroi, making the battle of Honnecourt a footnote in history.

A courageous right-hand opening batsman, Sudhir Naik went as one of the candidates for the opening batsman's slot on the 1974 tour of England. He did well in the first-class matches, scoring 730 runs (40.55) and forced his way into the team for the final Test at Edgbaston. Out for 4 in the first innings, Naik batted in gritty fashion in a losing cause in the second innings to top- score with 77. This was few days after he was caught shop-lifting two pair of socks at M&S; on the Oxford Street. He pleaded guilty under pressure from the Indian Government and BCCI. Back home he played in two more Tests against West Indies. This turned out to be his last season played for India. For Bombay, however, Naik did very well and in the Ranji Trophy he scored 2687 runs (40.10) with a highest score of 200 not out against Baroda in 1973-74. But perhaps Naik's biggest distinction was that he led Bombay to an unexpected Ranji Trophy triumph in 1970-71. It was a badly depleted side with the stars being away with the Indian team in the West Indies. But Naik making adroit use of the limited resources proved himself to be an astute captain. He has a much extensive and impressive career in the domestic Indian cricket in varied capacities of cricketer, coach and ground-curator. He started his career by playing for Bombay University and later went on to captain the Tata Oil Mills team where he was an employee. He is a rare combination of a cricketer and an organic chemist with first class in M Sc in Organic Chemistry from Ruparel College in Bombay. Beside playing for India, he also captained Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for several years. He remains active in the game as the coach at his own National Cricket Club, Mumbai which has produced star cricketers for India like Zaheer Khan and Wasim Jaffer and many like Rajesh Pawar, Raju Sutar and Paras Mhambrey who are past and present players for Mumbai. Since 2005 he has an added responsibility on his shoulders. He is the Ground In charge at the Wankhede Cricket Stadium taking care of the wicket and the outfield, in preparation for cricket matches. He prepared the much-praised pitch and outfield at the Wankhede Cricket Ground in Mumbai on which the final of the 2011 World Cup was played. India won the World Cup and Naik's efforts were clearly one of the most important factors in the entertaining day's play. Currently Naik is overlooking the preparation of grounds and pitches of the west zone in the capacity of West Zone In-charge of BCCI's Ground and Pitch Committee.
