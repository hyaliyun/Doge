Inardi, renowned parapsychology scholar, has got great popularity and the nickname of ‚Äúmagician‚Äù for his presumed ESP power to read the quiz's answers in the mind of the presenter Mike Bongiorno; in June, he wins too the final of the show. * April 6: the cable TV Telebiella, founded by the businessman and TV director Filippo Sacchi and by the anchorman Enzo Tortora, begins to broadcast. In spite of the poor means, it gets a wide success in the Biella district and its example is followed by other local cable TV in the whole Italy. Another breaking in the RAI monopoly are the foreign channels (TSI1, Tv Koper- Capodistria, Antenne 2) relayed also in the internal regions of Italy by private aerials. * August 26: RAI broadcasts in PAL color the opening ceremony of the 1972 Summer Olympics; till the September 11, the games are shown in color, alternating PAL and SECAM (the German system appears by far the best). The expected passage of the RAI to the color, wanted by the Post and Communication minister Giovanni Gioia, is however further delayed by the opposition of the Republican Party, which sees it as an incentive to consumerism and arrives to threaten a government crisis about the matter. * September 20: for the Festa dell‚ÄôUnit√†, the PCI puts into operation a cable TV, broadcasting the events of the manifestation. * December 15: the convention assigning the radio-TV services to RAI, expired after twenty years, is extended for another year.

Comencini underlines the realistic sides of the book and takes some liberties with the plot (the Pinocchio's metamorphosis in child is put at the beginning instead of the end); however, his version is the same considered the nearest one to the Collodi's spirit.

With the growth of the city of Rio de Janeiro - In large part caused by the existence of the train line - passenger trains started to run with ever increasing frequency, and the line would be electrified in 1937. The station was rebuilt in the 1900s, and had streetcars running from there to Vila Isabel, though these streetcars have since been abandoned. The subterranean passage between one side of the tracks and the other would be built in 1920. Though the station was originally used for both cargo and passenger transport, the inauguration of Silva Freire station caused it to be used exclusively for passenger transport, and the Deodoro Line as a whole is now used exclusively for passenger transport.

She remained with the Paris Opera for 30 years, seldom performing outside France. From 1944, she taught at the Paris Conservatory. Biography Born on 23 July 1884 at Oloron-Sainte-Marie in south-western France, Catherine Julie Lapeyrette studied at the Paris Conservatory under Jean Ernest Masson, Am√©d√©e Louis Hettich and Max Bouvet. In 1908 at the Paris Opera, after her d√©but as Dalila in Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Samson et Dalila, she went on to sing in the premi√®res of Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung (1908), Rheingold (1909) and Parsifal (1914). Lapeyrette also appeared at the Op√©ra-Comique in December 1918 as Amaranthe in Charles Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and played Marthe in Charles Gounod's Faust. In 1923, she appeared as Annina in the French premi√®re of Der Rosenkavalier, in 1921 in that of Gabriel Dupont's Antar and in 1923 in that of Albert Roussel's Padm√¢vat√Æ. She also sang in Alfred Bruneau's Le Jardin du Paris (1924), Max d'Ollone's L'Arlequin (1924), Andr√© Bloch's Broc√©liande (1925), and in Part II (Sept Chansons) of Gian Francesco Malipiero's L'Orfeide (1928). In 1931, Lapeyrette performed in Alb√©ric Magnard's Guerc≈ìur and in 1933 in the premi√®re of Joseph Canteloube's Vercing√©torix. She appeared with the Paris Opera company in Milan at La Scala as Dalida in 1910. She sang as a guest in Amsterdam (1936) and in London's Covent Garden as Amme in Paul Dukas' Ariane et Barbe-bleue (1938).

Mitochondria from donor cells are transported and incorporated into the endogenous mitochondrial network of recipient cells contributing to changes in the bioenergetics profile and in other functional properties of recipient cells. Horizontal cell-to-cell transfer of mitochondria and mitochondrial genome can occur among mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondrial transfer supports the exogenous replacement of damaged mitochondria, thereby rescuing mitochondrial defects. Stem cells, immortalized cells or primary cells are usually used as mitochondrial donors in most studies. These cells may transfer mitochondria to surrounding cells in their niche, thus affecting cell differentiation, proliferation, tissue homeostasis, development and ageing. Mechanism Horizontal transfer of mitochondria is mediated by actin-rich membrane protrusions named tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). The establishment of a nanotube begins with the formation of a filopodium-like membrane protrusion that retracts after reaching the recipient cell, leaving an ultrafine structure that is separated from the substrate. Chemical inhibitors or mechanical stress impairs the formation of TNTs and reduces mitochondrial exchange. On the other hand, certain types of stress agents such as doxorubicin or ethidium bromide increase TNT formation. Other proposed mechanisms of transfer include membrane microvesicles, cell fusion or mitochondrial extrusion. In vitro transfer The first evidence of functional mitochondrial transfer in vitro has been documented between human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human lung carcinoma cells. Healthy mitochondria from hMSCs moved to recipient lung carcinoma cells with nonfunctional mitochondria and repaired their function. Intercellular transfer of mitochondria in culture has been documented from MSCs and endothelial cells to breast cancer cell lines, ovarian cancer cell lines or to osteosarcoma cell line. Mitochondrial transfer can occur also between cancer cells such as mesothelioma and laryngeal carcinoma cells. Non-tumor cells such as human renal epithelial cells, human retinal pigment epithelial cells or human monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to transfer their mitochondria as well. All these data suggest that this phenomenon, regardless of the exact mechanisms involved, may be a fundamental physiological process well worthwhile exploring in a whole organism setting. In vivo transfer One of the first evidences of in vivo horizontal mitochondrial gene transfer was found in a transmissible canine venereal tumor (CTVT), highly adapted cancer transmitted during mating of feral dogs. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences revealed that CTVT cells periodically acquire mitochondria from its host and ensure overcoming high mutation rate that would promote the accumulation of deleterious mutations in their own mitochondria and long-term survival. Transfer of intact mitochondria can contribute to tissue repair in vivo. Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) injected into mice with acute lung injury transfer their mitochondria to lung alveoli cells and protect them against injury. Overexpression of Miro1, a protein connecting mitochondria to cytoskeletal motor proteins, leads to enhanced transfer of mitochondria from MSCs into stressed epithelial cells via TNTs in mice. In vivo horizontal transfer of mitochondria can occur in cancer cells which upon mitochondrial damage acquire mtDNA from surrounding donor healthy cells. This process restores transcription and translation of mtDNA-encoded genes as well as respiration.

It originally focused on satirical journalism in Jordan, and came to encompass news from the Arab world and from around the world, working with Arab writers and cartoonists from different parts of the Middle East and North Africa.  History  Isam Uraiqat, a Jordanian journalist of Palestinian heritage, co-founded Al-Hudood in Jordan in 2013. Though Al-Hudood is based in Jordan, its focus has expanded to include the Middle East and North Africa and the Arab world in general.  Organization  The website's team is composed of 7 full-time and 2 part-time employees, and about 20 freelance writers and 10 interns. Alhudood currently operates through grants, and it currently is funded from a grant by the European Endowment for Democracy, Open Society Foundations, and the Heinrich Boell Foundation, with a number of other funders now being interested in funding it for the coming future.  Controversy  With the strong restrictions on freedom of speech in the region, Alhudood took advantage of the flexibility and freedom that satire provides, and became an alternative media outlet that discusses various important and sensitive regional issues. It tackles such issues without having to adhere to the limitations imposed on traditional media by authority and society due to the nature of fiction. Alhudood has tackled issues of human rights, corruption, freedom of speech, gender equality and good governance, and portrays these themes in a manner that could be related to by readers from across the region, from an open, secular perspective, highlighting personal freedoms, freedom of speech, and feminism, using a darker, critical lens. Especially after the political change that swept through the Arab world in 2011, the youth in the region have become either apathetic to politics, or engaged in current sectarian and political polarization, in both cases leading to a growing disinterest in political and social dialogue. Even though it's an explicitly satirical network, Al-Hudood creates a substantial amount of controversy, particularly when the article crosses the three red lines: politics, religion, and sex. Some of its most controversial articles include: = Santa Claus arrested in Jabal Amman; all gifts confiscated = A number of major Jordanian news sources believed Al-Hudood's satirical story of Santa Claus's arrest, copying the article and publishing it as their own. Ad-Dustour printed the story in its newspapers such as Iram and Al-Watan, which led the Jordanian Public Security Directorate to release a statement renouncing the story, confirming that the security forces did not arrest \\"Santa Claus.\\" =Discovery of Brotherhood plot to drown Egypt using prayers for rain= As was the case with the story about the arrest of Santa Claus, Al-Hudood's story about the Brotherhood plot to drown Egypt with prayers for rain was treated as a real news story; there was an outpour of accusations from supporters of the Egyptian president Abdelfattah Es-Sisi against the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing them of actually plotting to drown Egypt. A number of news sites and channels accused Sisi supporters of fabricating fake news stories to defame the Muslim Brotherhood. = Drug Enforcement Agency lists Jameed as a controlled substance = A number of news sites copied Al-Hudood's satirical report that the Jordanian Drug Enforcement Agency had listed jameed‚Äîa hard, dry yogurt and the key ingredient in mansaf‚Äîas a schedule I controlled substance because it allegedly \\"impairs focus.\\" The news spread among Jordanians before the news sites discovered that the decision was not actually passed and deleted their articles, and before the Jordanian Fact-Checking Organization announced that the news was false. This has been the case with several pieces by Alhudood, which have been taken, word for word, by other media and newspapers. In this regards, Alhudood has pushed some of the publications themselves to start questioning what they read, and do less of the copy-pasting. Additionally, the website refrains from including the author's name in the byline in order to avoid danger.

He was born on 18 December 1970 in Boulogne-Billancourt. He was Chief Executive Officer of DS Automobiles, the new premium brand of Groupe PSA that he founded in 2015 with his team until January 2020. Yves Bonnefont is now leading a study on potential synergies within a portfolio of brands for Groupe PSA.  Career  Yves Bonnefont graduated from the engineering school √âcole Centrale Paris in 1993. He began his career at Groupe PSA in 1994 as a project manager at the PSA plant in Rennes before joining the PSA technical centre in V√©lizy. In November 1997, he left Groupe PSA to manage the French automotive division of Arthur Andersen for three years. He then joined McKinsey & Company, where he became associate director in 2006 and managed international research in the automotive sector from 2007. In 2010, he was appointed a member of the global committee that elects new associates. In 2012, at the height of the crisis in the automotive market, he decided to once again join Groupe PSA, becoming strategy director and notably overseeing decision-making in changes in positioning of the brands Citro√´n and Peugeot. In April 2013, he was appointed deputy managing director of Citro√´n, assisting Fr√©d√©ric Banzet. In 2014, he became the first chief executive officer of DS Automobiles when it was founded, at the instigation of Carlos Tavares. He created Groupe PSA's connected vehicles business unit, for which he was responsible until the mobility brand Free2Move was launched. He freely admits to being impatient. ‚ÄòWhen I‚Äôm told we need six months, I set a three-month period ...,‚Äô he said in the French periodical Challenges, in a portrait of him as part of a report on the creation of the DS Automobiles brand. His closest colleagues are Arnaud Ribault, Sales and Marketing Director, Marion David, Product Manager, and Thierry M√©troz, Style Director. They work in the same space in Groupe PSA's new head office in Rueil-Malmaison. At a conference at the Salon des Entrepreneurs trade fair in Paris in February 2018, he explained that he personally meets up with all new recruits at DS Automobiles and spends one day per week on the ground, in plants, points of sale and research centres. He was the first CEO of a premium brand to have invested in Formula E, with the conquest of the 2018/2019 Drivers and Teams titles of Jean-Eric Vergne and DS TECHEETAH. In 2019, the brand recorded a 17% growth with DS 3 CROSSBACK and DS 7 CROSSBACK and an effective deployment in 38 countries around the world, with 400 points of sale. At the end of the year, DS 3 CROSSBACK E-TENSE and DS 7 CROSSBACK E-TENSE 4x4 plug-in hybrid versions are available. In January 2020, he was replaced at the head of DS Automobiles by B√©atrice Foucher, former deputy director of the brand. He also pursues work in investment: until April 2018, he was Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Trescal. Since then, he has continued to invest in start-ups, such as Iziwork, and serve on their boards.  Personal life  Yves Bonnefont is the father of five sons.

Yvoir  * Godinne site * Cr√®che Village des Enfants nursery  Dinant  * Dinant University Hospital (Centre Hospitalier de Dinant) ** Saint- Vincent site ** Saint-Anne site; 133-bed nursing home. * Cr√®che Les Pommes d'Amour nursery  Lustin  * R√©sidence Saint-Thomas de Villeneuve nursing home * R√©sidence Al√©gria nursing home  Erpent  * Cardiology Center * Centre for Specialized Medicine * Les Baseilles Medical Centre  Ciney  * Sainte-Marie Medical Center  Givet, France  * Givet Medical Center  History  The Saint-Elisabeth nursing school (today called the ECNAS, √âcole Namuroise de soins Sainte-√âlisabeth) was founded by royal decree in 1922, by the Sisters of Charity in the village of Salzinnes, on Charles Zoude street, which still today leads to the Sainte-√âlisabeth site. The Foyer Saint-Fran√ßois palliative care centre was founded south of the Sainte-√âlisabeth site in 1989. In 1903, a sanatorium opened in Mont-sur-Meuse (Yvoir), and was bought in 1919 by the National Alliance of Christian Mutual Societies (ANMC). The Mont-Godinne hospital in Yvoir was then founded on January 1, 1928 by the non-profit organization Solidarit√© Mutualiste Chr√©tienne, a member of the ANMC. Its headquarters are located at 1031 Brussels (postal code reserved for Christian associations). In 1967, an agreement was signed between Solidarit√© Mutualiste Chr√©tienne and the Catholic University of Louvain, still established in Louvain (Leuven). Since then, the hospital has maintained privileged links with the Universit√© catholique de Louvain and its Dutch-speaking equivalent, the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven. Its 300 beds became university beds in the counting by the Ministry of Public Health. In 2004, the Mont-Godinne hospital changed its name to Cliniques universitaires UCL de Mont-Godinne, in reference to UCLouvain's Saint-Luc University Hospital (Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc) on the Brussels campus of UCLouvain Bruxelles Woluwe. The hospital changed its name once again to become the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Mont-Godinne in 2011, still jointly managed by UCLouvain and the Christian Mutual Societies. The Dinant Hospital Centre (Centre hospitalier de Dinant, CHD) was founded on 15 May 1987 as a public hospital of the City of Dinant. Its functioning is initially governed by the municipality's Public Social Action Centre (CPAS). In 2012, the CHU Mont-Godinne in Yvoir merged with the Centre hospitalier de Dinant, forming the CHU UCL Mont-Godinne Dinant (CHU-UCL-MGD). Mergers are necessary to comply with the \\"healthcare basin\\" policy desired by the regional and federal governments. In 2015, the CHU-UCL-MGD and the Clinique et Maternit√© Saint-√âlisabeth in Namur merged into the Centre hospitalier universitaire Dinant Godinne Saint-Elisabeth - UCL-Namur, a new structure with 5 different hospital facilities. The institution's headquarters is maintained in Mont-Godinne, Yvoir. From that moment, the UCLouvain Namur University Hospital became the largest employer in the province of Namur. The entire CHU UCLouvain Namur is recognized as university hospital and attached to UCLouvain, but only the 300 beds of Mont-Godinne are counted as \\"university beds\\". Since 2017, thanks to a biomass gasification process, the Mont-Godinne site is be powered by clean energy from ecological production. From November 2018 onwards, to face the shortage of doctors in rural areas of northern France, specialists from the Godinne and Dinant sites are also at work in the French municipality of Givet, in the small Givet Medical Center. 15% of the patients at the Dinant site are French. At the scientific level, the UCLouvain Namur University Hospital is linked with the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry (MEDE) of the University of Louvain, established on the UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe campus. However, the hospital also maintains relations with the nearby Faculty of Medicine of the University of Namur (UNamur). It de facto serves as a teaching hospital for both universities.

He authored the Bang and Olufsen Book of Hi-fi and developed an elevating powerchair in the early eighties. Born to Harry Stirling Crawfurd Everard MBE and Eileen Eunice (n√©e Mander) in Radlett, Herts, Everard was educated at Uppingham School. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford to read Engineering Sciences in 1965. Career After working at Cambridge Consultants and Neve Electronics Everard founded Cambridge Electronic Workshop (CEW) and became a freelance designer working on instrumentation in 1973. He wrote the Bang and Olufson Book of Hi-Fi for non technical enthusiasts in 1977. In 1981, Everard‚Äôs infant daughter Ruth was diagnosed with Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and he created his original idea for a p√¶diatric powered chair in April of that year. His daughter had her first drive in the new powerchair aged twenty months, and began using it just before she was two years old. This early machine, known as ‚ÄúThe Yellow Peril‚Äù was then developed into a production version named ‚ÄúThe Turbo‚Äù. This product was manufactured throughout the 1980s and a later version is held in the Science Museum collection in London. In the early nineties, the companies behind the Turbo closed and Everard spent his time supporting Turbo owners and developing a new PowerChair to replace his daughter's. The Dragon was born and a new company was founded in 2003 and incorporated as a limited company in 2005 with its name formally changed to DragonMobility at that time. At this time a new, smaller powerchair - the SnapDragon was developed for children weighing less than 40kg. In 2013, Everard was nominated for the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, which was won by Robert Kahn, Vinton Cerf, Louis Pouzin, Tim Berners-Lee, and Marc Andreessen for their work creating the Internet and the World Wide Web.

The plan also includes a private currency implemented as a cryptocurrency. The currency and network do not yet exist, and only rudimentary experimental code has been released. The launch is planned to be in 2020. The project, currency and transactions are to be managed and cryptographically entrusted to the Libra Association, a membership organization of companies from payment, technology, telecommunication, online marketplace and venture capital, and nonprofits. History Morgan Beller started working on cryptocurrency and blockchain at Facebook in 2017, and was initially the only person working on Facebook's blockchain initiative. Facebook vice president David A. Marcus moved from Facebook Messenger to a new blockchain division in May 2018. First reports of Facebook planning a cryptocurrency, with Marcus in charge, emerged a few days later. By February 2019, there were more than 50 engineers working on the project. Confirmation that Facebook intended a cryptocurrency first emerged in May 2019. At this time it was known as \\"GlobalCoin\\" or \\"Facebook Coin\\".Social Media Monopolies and Cryptocurrencies: Facebook's Proposed Coin. Cybersecurity, Privacy, & Networks eJournal. Social Science Research Network. (SSRN). Accessed June 19, 2019. Libra was formally announced on June 18, 2019. The creators of the coin are listed as Morgan Beller, David Marcus and Kevin Weil (Novi's VP of Product). A first version is projected to be released in 2020. On July 15, 2019, Facebook announced the currency will not launch until all regulatory concerns have been met and Libra has the \\"appropriate approvals\\". In a meeting with top Senate Democratic leaders on September 18, 2019, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told lawmakers that Libra would not be launched anywhere in the world without first obtaining approval from United States regulators. PayPal left the Libra Association on 4 October 2019. eBay, Mastercard, Stripe, Visa and Mercado Pago followed on 11 October, and Booking Holdings on 14 October. Currency The plan is for the Libra token to be backed by financial assets such as a basket of currencies, and US Treasury securities in an attempt to avoid volatility. Facebook has announced that each of the partners will inject an initial 10 million, so Libra has full asset backing on the day it opens. As of January 2020, Libra is said to have dropped the idea of a mixed currency basket in favor of individual stablecoins pegged to individual currencies. Libra service partners, within the Libra Association, will create new Libra currency units based on demand. Libra currency units will be retired as they are redeemed for conventional currency. Initial reconciliation of transactions will be performed at each service partner, and the blockchain's distributed ledger will be used for reconciliation between service partners. The intent is to help prevent everyone but members of the Libra Association from trying to extract and analyse data from the distributed ledger. In contrast to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin which use permissionless blockchains, Libra is not decentralized, relying on trust in the Libra Association as \\"a de facto central bank\\". In September 2019, Facebook announced that the reserve basket would be made up of: 50% United States dollar, 18% Euro, 14% Japanese yen, 11% Pound sterling and 7% Singapore dollar. Libra has considered using coins based on individual national currencies on the network, alongside the basket-based Libra token. This was first mooted publicly by David Marcus in October 2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-facebook/facebook-open- to-currency-pegged-stablecoins-for-libra-project-idUSKBN1WZ0NX and by Mark Zuckerberg in his October 2019 Senate testimony. The idea was promoted again in March 2020. On April 16, 2020, Libra announced plans to create an infrastructure for multiple cryptocurrencies, the preponderance of which will be backed by individual fiat currencies, and said the association was in talks with regulators from Switzerland for a payments license. Libra Association Facebook established the Libra Association to oversee the currency, founded in Geneva, Switzerland. Initial membership as of October 2019 was: * Payments: PayU Checkout.com * Technology and marketplaces: Facebook's subsidiary Novi Financial, Farfetch, Lyft, Spotify, Uber, Shopify * Telecommunications: Iliad SA, Vodafone (since left) * Blockchain: Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Xapo * Venture capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures * Nonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions: Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women's World Banking Seven other companies had been named as Libra Association members in the initial June 2019 announcement, but left before the first Libra meeting on 14 October 2019: Booking Holdings, eBay, Mastercard, Mercado Pago, PayPal, Stripe and Visa Inc. Visa chairman and CEO Alfred F. Kelly clarified in July that Visa had not joined, but had signed a nonbinding letter of intent; and that \\"no one has yet officially joined.\\" He said that factors determining whether Visa would, in fact, join included \\"the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements.\\" Vodafone joined the association in October 2019, but left in January 2020, saying they preferred to work on their mobile banking subsidiary M-Pesa. Press coverage around the initial Libra announcement noted the absence of Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon and of any banks. Banking executives had been reluctant to join due to uncertainties surrounding regulation and feasibility of the scheme. In late February 2020, e-commerce site Shopify and cryptocurrency brokerage Tagomihttps://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/libra-tagomi/ joined. The association hopes to grow to 100 members with an equal vote. In late April 2020, the payment processing company, Checkout.com, announced they would be joining the association. In May 2020, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, cryptocurrency investor Paradigm and private equity firm Slow Ventures announced they would join the association. Reception The project has faced criticism and opposition from central banks. The use of a cryptocurrency and blockchain for the implementation has been questioned. = European Union regulatory response = The first regulator response to Libra came within minutes of the launch announcement, from French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, who was being interviewed on French radio station Europe 1. He said that Libra could not be allowed to become a sovereign currency, and would require strong consumer protections. Le Maire then warned the French Parliament of his concerns about Libra and privacy, money laundering and terrorism finance. He called on the central bank governors of the Group of Seven to prepare a report on Facebook's plans. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was a need to keep an \\"open mind\\" about new technology for money transfers, but \\"anything that works in this world will become instantly systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation.\\" German MEP Markus Ferber warned that Facebook could become a shadow bank. On September 13, 2019, Le Maire stated that France would not allow development of Libra in the European Union, as would be a threat to the monetary sovereignty of states. He also spoke about the potential for abuse of marketing dominance and systemic financial risks as reasons for not allowing stablecoins to operate yet within the EU. =United States regulatory response= US regulators and politicians expressed concerns within hours of the mid-2019 announcement. Maxine Waters, Chairperson of the United States House Committee on Financial Services Committee asked Facebook to halt the development and launch of Libra, citing a list of recent scandals and that \\"the cryptocurrency market currently lacks a clear regulatory framework\\". The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services Democrats sent a letter to Facebook asking the company to stop development of Libra, citing concerns of privacy, national security, trading, and monetary policy. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on 10 July that the Fed had \\"serious concerns\\" as to how Libra would deal with \\"money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.\\" President Donald Trump tweeted on 12 July that \\"If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations.\\" US regulators contacted Visa, PayPal, Mastercard and Stripe, asking for a complete overview of how Libra would fit into their anti-money-laundering compliance programs. Since several participants left the project in late 2019, the Libra Association has been working to address concerns from United States regulators with the development of a \\"Libra 2.0\\" blueprint. = Other countries = The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, that David Marcus told the US Senate would oversee privacy for Libra, said that it had not heard from Facebook at all. The government of Japan has begun the process of investigating Libra and doing an analysis on the effect on Japan's monetary policy and financial regulation. This will be done before the Group of Seven meeting in France between 24‚Äì26 August 2019. Data protection regulators internationally issued a statement asking Facebook to protect personal data of users, and to detail Libra's planned practices for handling personal data, in the light of \\"previous episodes where Facebook‚Äôs handling of people‚Äôs information has not met the expectations of regulators, or their own users.\\" Finance Watch describes Libra as a \\"huge risk to public monetary sovereignty\\" and \\"concludes that Libra is a bad idea ‚Äì for its users, for the stability of our financial system, and last but not least for our democracy.\\" On September 16, 2019, officials from the Libra consortium, including J.P. Morgan and Facebook, met with officials from 26 central banks, including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, in Basel, Switzerland and the meeting was chaired by European Central Bank board member Beno√Æt C≈ìur√©, a vocal Libra critic. =Privacy concerns= Industry observers have speculated whether Libra will provide meaningful privacy to its users. Facebook's plan is to let its subsidiary Novi Financial manage Libra for Facebook users, and Facebook executives have stated that Novi will not share account holder's purchase information with Facebook without authorization. However, the system is also planned to include a friend-finder search function, and the use of this function will constitute permission for Novi to combine the account holder's transaction history with their Facebook account. =Fake Libra websites= Facebook tries to police inaccurate information and fake Libra websites on its platform. Legal issues Libra Association faces legal challenges as both the name and the logo of the digital currency are already in use within different territories. Finco Services, Inc has filed a lawsuit with New York Southern District Court against Facebook, Inc., Novi Financial, Inc., Jlv, LLC and Character SF, LLC for an alleged trademark infringement arising out of the use by the latter of a logo similar to the start-up bank operated by Finco Services, Inc. The plaintiff has requested a preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as monetary relief from the defendants. A settlement conference in this matter is scheduled for March 26, 2020 in the United States Courthouse, while the parties did not consent to conducting the proceedings before a magistrate judge and requested to be tried to a jury. In Europe, Libra Association has filed an application with the European Union Intellectual Property Office for the registration of the word ‚ÄúLIBRA‚Äù as a verbal trademark. The proceeding has already received five oppositions to registration from four European companies based mainly on the alleged likelihood of confusion with their prior trademarks. The opposing companies are Lyra Network, Libra Internet Bank, Libri GmbH and Advanced New Technologies Co., Ltd. In April 2020, the parties will reach the adversarial part of the opposition proceedings, unless a settlement is reached during the cooling-off period. Implementation = Blockchain consensus = Libra will not rely on cryptocurrency mining. Only members of the Libra Association will be able to process transactions via the permissioned blockchain. Libra hopes to begin transitioning to a permissionless proof-of-stake system within five years; although their own materials admit that no solution exists \\"that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network.\\" =Software= Libra's source code is written in Rust and published as open source under the Apache License with the launch on 18 June 2019. Elaine Ou, an opinion writer at Bloomberg News, tried compiling and running the publicly released code for Libra. As supplied, the software did little more than allow fake coins to be put in a wallet; almost none of the functionality outlined in the white paper is implemented, including \\"major architectural features that have yet to be invented.\\" Ou was surprised that Facebook \\"would release software in such a state.\\" =Digital wallet= Facebook plans to release a digital wallet called Novi in 2020, to be made available in Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as in a standalone app. =Move= Move is the Libra blockchain's proposed smart contract and custom transactions language. It is planned to be a statically- typed programming language, compiled to bytecode. The Move language syntax has not been released yet. An example Intermediate representation of the language is shown in the Move white paper: public main(payee: address, amount: u64) { let coin: 0x0.Currency.Coin = 0x0.Currency.withdraw_from_sender(copy(amount)); 0x0.Currency.deposit(copy(payee), move(coin)); } See also * Beenz ‚Äì an earlier attempt at an internet-wide digital currency * Facebook Credits * Flooz ‚Äì an earlier attempt at an internet-wide digital currency * Bitcoin - cryptocurrency in use today and that has largest market cap * List of online payment service providers References External links * Category:Cryptocurrencies Category:Facebook Category:Free software programmed in Rust ","title":"Libra (digital currency)"},{"id":"61072976","text":"Bishop Desmond A.

She was one of the first women to take up anthropology as a profession.  Family and education  Blackman was born in Norwich to Rev. James Henry Blackman and Mary Anne Blackman (n√©e Jacob). She was one of five children, and her brother Aylward M. Blackman also became a noted egyptologist. The Blackwood family later moved to Oxford. Blackman registered to study at the Pitt Rivers Museum from 1912 to 1915, taking the Diploma in Anthropology at the University of Oxford. She also worked on cataloguing collections at the Pitt Rivers Museum between 1912 and 1920, and donated some objects to the museum.  Academic career  Blackwood spent much of the 1920s and 1930s living and working in Egypt. She and her brother Aylward often collaborated. She had a particular interest in \\"magico-religious\\" ideas and practices. In 1927 she published The Fellahin of Upper Egypt, which became a standard work on the ethnography of the region. Unusually for the time, she chose to focus on the habits, beliefs and customs of contemporary (rather than ancient) Egyptians. That same year she also began collecting ethnographic objects for the wealthy collector Sir Henry Wellcome. She was forced to accept stringent conditions in return for his support (including a promise not to collect anything for anyone else, including herself). She collected an estimated 4,000 individual items for him between 1926 and 1933. After the Second World War broke out in 1939, Blackwood returned to Britain. In 1950 she was committed to a mental hospital after suffering a mental and physical breakdown after the death of her younger sister Elsie. She died shortly afterwards, aged 78.

The current champions are FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood), who are in their first reign. History On June 18, 2019, six months after the American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) was founded, a tournament was announced to crown the promotion's inaugural tag team champions. That same day, a three-way tag team match for AEW's event Fyter Fest on June 29 was scheduled, featuring Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta), SoCal Uncensored (Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky), and Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) with the winning team advancing to All Out for an opportunity at a first round bye in the AEW World Tag Team Championship tournament.

He formed a close bond with his older brother (canonized in 2004) and the two studied together under a priest uncle. He tried music after experiencing doubts about his vocation but continued his studies leading to his ordination in Messina where he would spend his entire life ministering to people. He aided the ill during a cholera epidemic while in 1908 aiding in rescue and reconstruction efforts following a violent earthquake. Di Francia also taught moral theological studies to seminarians for a time before being given a role in archdiocesan curial affiars some months before his death from a heart attack. The beatification process for the late priest opened in the mid-1980s (he became titled as a Servant of God) after his order lobbied for a cause to be opened in the Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela archdiocese. The cause culminated on 19 March 2019 after Pope Francis acknowledged his life of heroic virtue and so titled him as Venerable. Life Francesco Maria di Francia was born on 19 February 1853 in Messina as the last of four children to the nobleman Francesco di Francia (c. 1818-10.10.1852) and Anna Toscano (c. 1829-1888). His father died just four months before his birth. His parents married around 1846. His older brother Annibale was canonized in 2004. He was baptized on 27 February 1853 in the names of \\"Maria Francesco di Paola\\" in honor of the saint of that name. His siblings (in order) were his brother Giovanni and his sister Maria Caterina and then his saint brother Annibale. Both he and his older brother Annibale were first entrusted to an old aunt before being sent to the College of the Cistercian Fathers in Messina under the care of their paternal priest uncle Raffaele di Francia. It was he who oversaw his and his older brother Annibale's education due to his mother being unable to provide for all her children on her own. His brother was noted for being more like his father while he was noted for being more like his mother due to his affection and dedication. Their schooling under their uncle both instilled in them a desire to enter the priesthood but their mother opposed her two sons entering the priesthood (despite her own strong religious devotion) though relented at a later point. Di Francia loved music since his childhood as well as poems and in 1869 composed a short song in honor of Saint Francesco di Paola (his patron saint). Di Francia received the clerical garb (in secret from his mother since she was still opposed to his vocation at that stage) in the San Francesco church on 7 December 1869. But he soon experienced doubts about the strength of his vocation and so left his studies to discern his future. His passion for music saw him twice pursue paths down a musical career in Naples but these did not work out in the end. He returned to his studies after determining God's plan for him and on 19 March 1877 received the tonsure in 1877. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 18 December 1880 in the San Paolo church in Messina from the metropolitan archbishop Cardinal Giuseppe Guarino. His pastoral duties extended to all, though his brother's activities as a priest inspired him to focus on the poor in more depth than he had before. In the late summer of 1887 a cholera epidemic hit Messina and Guarino granted di Francia permission to tend to the ill sufferers of the disease in the most affected areas despite his mother's concerns that he would contract the disease himself (she died in 1888 after the epidemic ended). He also was motivated to help when he saw few doctors offering their support to the victims. He worked among the ill for the duration of the epidemic and following this in 1888 began tending to ill children in the civic hospital. For a time di Francia taught moral theological studies to seminarians in Messina. In 1896 he first met the Servant of God Natala Briguglio and she inspired him to found an order catering to female religious. In 1897 in Messina he founded a religious congregation called the Poor Sisters of the Sacred Heart which later became titled the Capuchin Sisters of the Sacred Heart; Briguglio became a professed religious as \\"Veronica di Ges√π Bambino\\" and was the first to join this order. He and his brother helped in the rescue and reconstruction efforts following the violent earthquake that struck Messina on 28 December 1908. On 28 February 1912 the archbishop Letterio D'Arrigo Ramondini appointed him as the archdiocesan vicar general in a move that meant he had curial responsibilities to manage and which saw him work closer to the archbishop. But he still managed to go around preaching and hearing confessions despite the increased workload. Di Francia came to Messina via train during the morning on 22 December 1913 but felt unwell in the train station in what was a heart attack. He asked to go to Roccalumera despite his deteriorating condition and said: \\"I prepare for paradise\\". Di Francia died there at 9:00pm from a heart attack with the nuns of his order gathered at his bedside after he blessed them. His brother learnt about his death on 31 December from Florence and wrote a letter to the archbishop to extoll his brother's good works and to express his condolences to the archdiocese. His remains were exhumed and relocated on 24 May 1935 from his grave to the Santuario di Sant'Antonio di Padova in Roccalumera that Briguglio oversaw work on. His order received a decree of praise on 4 March 1943 and then papal approval from Pope Pius XII on 16 February 1957 and exists in countries such as Colombia and Slovakia. The end of 2008 saw the order have 224 religious in 29 houses. Beatification process The beatification process launched on 8 July 1986 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints provided the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) declaration and titled di Francia as a Servant of God. This decree also enabled for the cause's initial investigation to be launched on the archdiocesan level. This diocesan process for the investigation was opened in the Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela archdiocese on 12 June 1989 and closed less than a decade later on 3 October 1996. The investigation saw 144 testimonies collected as well as documentation attesting to di Francia's reputation for holiness. Other processes were held in Albano and Turin as well as in Brescia and Trani for supporting evidence. The investigation moved to Rome where the C.C.S. issued a decree on 6 November 1998 validating the process and confirming that it abided to their rules for conducting diocesan investigations. The postulation (the officials coordinating the cause) compiled and submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials for additional evaluation on 22 December 2014. Historians approved the cause on 29 September 2015 as did nine theologians on 19 June 2018 and the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members later on 5 March 2019. Di Francia became titled as Venerable on 19 March 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree acknowledging the fact that Di Francia had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. The current postulator for the cause is Fra Carlo Calloni O.F.M. Cap.

Early life and education Shannon Downey was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts. Downey's parents were union organizers. Their home was the epicenter of organizing and community activism. As a result, Downey was involved, as a child, in protests, which inspired their activism as an adult. Downey learned how to cross-stitch in the fifth grade. Career and crafting Downey worked in digital marketing for ten years. Today, Downey serves as director of development at Asian American Advancing Justice. Downey is also an adjunct professor of business at DePaul University and Columbia College. =Crafting= Downey returned to cross-stitching as a hobby, learning the craft after feeling \\"burnt out\\" in their decade long career in technology. They found a cross-stitch pattern on Etsy of Captain Picard and began cross stitching again. After Downey's house was involved in a drive by shooting, Downey created their first craftivism piece about gun violence. Downey posted the picture on Instagram and received requests for the pattern. In response, Downey asked for other crafters to create their own gun violence-related patterns. The pieces were exhibited at an art gallery, with all being sold, raising $5,000 for an anti-violence nonprofit, Project Fire. Downey started BadAss Cross Stitch in 2016 to showcase her craftivism pieces. Downey's breakthrough piece was \\"Boys Will Be Boys\\", a cross-stitch created in response to the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape. The piece, which reads \\"Boys will be ~~boys~~ held accountable for their fucking actions,\\" went viral after being shared by Rose McGowan, Colin Hanks, Adriana Lima, Sarah Hyland, Martha Hunt, Zo√´ Kravitz, Tracee Ellis Ross, Jonathan Tucker, and Emily Ratajkowski. Her cross-stitch for the first Women's March in Chicago went viral after being shared by George Takei. The sign reads \\"I'm so angry I stitched this just so I could stab something 3,000 times.\\" In 2019, Downey launched Badass Herstory, a public art and digital project. Downey's goal through the project is to collect one million stories of women, female identifying, and gender non- conforming people, all presented in cross-stitch form. That same year, Downey created a project to complete a quilt, which they found partially completed at an estate sale in the Chicago area. The United States' themed quilt was started by 99-year-old Rita Smith, who died before completing the project. Downey recruited crafters from across the country to finish the project. The completed quilt was displayed in December 2019 at Women Made Gallery in Chicago. The project, titled \\"Rita's Quilt\\", was chosen as one of the \\"top feel good stories\\" by The Guardian for 2019.

The initial casting call described Alexis as a \\"selfish, ditzy socialite\\" and a young Goldie Hawn. In the original unaired pilot presentation, Alexis Rose was portrayed by Abby Elliott. When Schitt's Creek was picked up to series by the CBC, Elliott was unable to commit, and a subsequent casting call was held in Los Angeles. According to Dan Levy, Murphy's audition stood out because of the \\"wonderfully natural likability\\" she brought to the role. Eugene was initially hesitant about her casting because he had envisioned Alexis as having blonde hair instead of Murphy's naturally brunette locks. Murphy dyed her hair blonde upon booking the role.  Characterization and themes  = Personality and personal style = Alexis arrives in Schitt's Creek as a highly self-involved \\"celebutante\\". She is often comically oblivious and frequently misinterprets the actions of those around her. Alexis is also generous and \\"kindhearted\\", embracing the potential of nearly every individual or opportunity she comes across. As summarized by Vulture, her presence is \\"part calculated humblebrag, part genuine warmth, and part rich bitch\\". Alexis wears a \\"bohemian\\" wardrobe inspired by the likes of Sienna Miller. According to Dan Levy, the character's style is also a reflection of her time spent traveling in New York and Europe. As such, she is frequently seen sporting designers such as Isabel Marant and Derek Lam ‚Äì even when doing physical labor as part of her community service.\\"Wine and Roses\\". Schitt's Creek. Season 1. Episode 6. March 11, 2015. Pop TV. These high-end clothes are meant to serve as a reminder to the audience of the family's prior wealth. =Voice and mannerisms= Alexis speaks with a vocal fry and sometimes uses exaggerated hand gestures. According to Murphy, she began saying \\"Ew, David\\" in a peculiar way without realizing it, and the phrase eventually made its way onto welcome mats, T-shirts, and at least one license plate. The actress says this tone was partially influenced by reality stars and actresses like the Kardashian sisters, Lindsey Lohan, and Paris Hilton. She also credits these same individuals with helping her develop Alexis's signature hand movements, which she describes as \\"a T-Rex playing the piano at an old-timey saloon\\".  Reception  =Critical reception= Murphy's turn as Alexis Rose has garnered much positive press, with some critics declaring her the \\"breakout star\\" of the series. In an early review, LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club called her take on the partying socialite \\"scarily amazing\\". People Magazines Gillian Telling also noted that Murphy not only held her own against her more seasoned co-stars, she \\"occasionally steals the scene\\". As Schitt's Creek gained a larger following in its later seasons, Murphy received additional praise. In a season 4 review, Michael Ausiello of TVLine called her performance a \\"magic trick\\" which balanced relatability, sympathy, and charm. Vanity Fair Richard Lawson was also complimentary, noting Murphy and Alexis's ability to maintain her \\"winning bite\\" while adding a sense of \\"kindness and intellectual curiosity\\". Joe Reid of Decider declared David and Alexis \\"the show's heart and soul\\" before approvingly adding that \\"Murphy's delivery is like a vaudeville interpretation of what a spoiled rich girl would sound like\\". Caroline Framke of Vox similarly agreed noting that Dan Levy and Annie Murphy were Schitt Creek's \\"backbone and beating heart\\". =Accolades= For her work as Alexis, Murphy has been nominated for three Canadian Screen Awards for Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role in 2016, 2018, and 2019. In 2019, Murphy was awarded the Gracie Award for Actress in a Breakthrough Role. In 2020, Murphy received a Primetime Emmy Award win for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Murphy has also received several awards and nominations as a member of the Schitt's Creek ensemble cast. This includes two Canadian Screen Awards for Best Comedy in 2016 and 2019; one ACTRA Award for Member's Choice Series Ensemble in 2019; and two Dorian Awards for TV Comedy of the Year and Unsung TV Show of the Year in 2019.

It lies mostly in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg, smaller areas are in the Swiss canton of St. Gallen. The two peninsulas in the lake are called Rheinspitz (west) and Rohrspitz (east).  Geography  The delta of the Alpine Rhine forms a common delta area with the eastern deltas of the rivers Dornbirner Ach and Bregenzer Ach. In the north, the border of the Rhine delta runs along the shore of Lake Constance. The southern border depends on the course of Lake Constance after the melting of the Rhine glacier. It is usually at least a few kilometers long.Geographical overview of the Rhine deltaThe area covers an area of 2,065 hectares, of which 1,960 hectares are on Austrian territory. About two thirds of the Rhine delta consists of water (1,300 hectares), which generally has a depth of just a few meters.  Nature park  The Rhine delta is the largest wetland biotope reserve on Lake Constance and extends from the mouth of the Alter Rhein over the mouth of the Neuer Rhein to the Dornbirner Ach in Hard (Vorarlberg). Both Austria and Switzerland have each designated the area as a nature reserve. Due to its great ecological importance, the Vorarlberg area of the Rhine delta is a wetland of international importance (a so-called Ramsar site). Since 1995, the nature reserve is part of the Natura 2000 network focussing on fauna-flora habitat and bird protection. = Fauna and flora =  Fauna  The variety of birds inhabiting the nature park contributes significantly to this ecological importance. To date, well over 300 bird species have been observed which makes the Rhine delta nature park popular among ornithologists and bird watchers. Shallow water and silt areas are important resting and breeding places as well as food spots for water birds and waders. Numerous rare and endangered species breed in the about 2,000 hectares of wet meadows, reed beds and riparian forests.Peninsula Rohrspitz on Lake Constance The Rhine delta is an ideal habitat for many amphibians, too. So far, nine species and a hybrid form (the edible frog) have been identified in this area. The large populations of water frogs are remarkable. European tree frogs and crested newts are also found locally in considerable numbers. Moreover, five native reptile species live in the area. In 2006, the wall lizard was first detected at the mouth of the Rhine. The wall lizard is a heat-loving lizard species with a distribution focus in the Mediterranean. They likely to have settled in Vorarlberg after having been exposed. Although primarily known for its bird life, the Rhine delta is also an important habitat for mammals, especially for small mammals. The crowned shrew and the greater white-toothed shrew, among others, are found in the area and are restricted to the Alpine Rhine valley in Austria. So far, four bat species have been reliably detected. The beaver was eradicated in Vorarlberg in 1686 due to its fur and usage as a fasting meal. In 2006, beaver traces were discovered at the Old Rhine for the first time in over 300 years. In the meantime, the beaver has spread further and has already populated several bodies of water in the Rhine valley.  Flora  Water birds at the Fu√üacher bay Although the land area comprises only about a third of the over 2000 hectare nature reserve, the Rhine delta offers habitat for numerous plant species. Riparian forests, scattered meadows, reed beds and grass beds are the most ecologically valuable rural habitats. Large flat water zones and special locations such as dams and ruderal areas increase biodiversity. So far, around 600 flowering plants and ferns have been detected, with several species in all of Austria or in Central Europe under threat. 33 species of the area are considered lost or have become extinct. These include, for example, the waterwheel plant, a carnivorous aquatic plant, the rarity of which once led Ferdinand I of Bulgaria to the Rhine delta several times. The decline in species is primarily caused by drainage, intensified land use and river engineering. However, there is also a number of new species in the flora of the Rhine delta, especially from America and Asia, that mainly inhabits artificial locations such as the Rhine dams.  Tourism  = Das Rheindeltahaus (\\"the Rhine delta house\\") = The Rheindeltahaus is the service point and conservation station of the nature reserve. Visitors can gather information about guided excursions. It is a space for research, administrative work as well as public outreach work. Additionally, there are changing exhibitions about the Rhine delta. The fir timber house was designed by the architecture firm HK Architekten, which are known for their wood-based public buildings across Vorarlberg. The Rheindeltahaus was completed in 1998. Taking into consideration the flood levels of its location in Fu√üach, the house is built on stilts. Due to a photovoltaic system and a heat recovery system, the house is a low-energy construction. = Cycling = The Rhine delta cycle route is suitable for both sporty and leisurely cyclists. The route is about 47,4 km long and has only little ascent. Along the way on the Old Rhine and on the shores of Lake Constance, there is a variety of swimming spots. = Lagoon circular walk = Great crested grebe in the Rhine delta The lagoon tour in the Rhine delta along the dam offers a view onto Lake Constance, and in particular onto the Lindau island. * Route: Rhine estuary ‚Äì Fu√üach ‚Äì In der Schanz ‚Äì Lagoon ‚Äì In der Schanz * Distance: 4,7 km * Duration: About 1,5 hours = Bird-watching = With more than 340 recorded species (until 2002), the Rhine delta is a popular nature park among bird watchers. It is a well-known area for spotting rarities, especially waders. Since 1982, it is an Important Bird Area. The BirdsClub-App, an app created for the Rhine area, will help bird watchers identify the birds sighted.

No law enforcement officers or civilians were injured in the shooting, though one person sustained a superficial injury when she was taking cover. The shooter, identified as Brian Isaack Clyde, was then shot and killed by one or more federal officers. Shooting A man, identified as Brian Isaack Clyde, opened fire near Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse, before making his way to the glass door of the building and opening fire inside. Three officers from the Federal Protective Service returned fire. Following an exchange of gunfire, in which Clyde was fatally shot by one or more federal officers, he ran towards the parking lot and fired five more rounds before he collapsed. Federal officers performed CPR and took Clyde to the Baylor University Medical Center, approximately from the courthouse, where he was pronounced deceased. Authorities later detonated his vehicle. At the time of the shooting, Clyde was carrying more than 150 rounds of ammunition. Photojournalist Tom Fox, who works for The Dallas Morning News, was at the courthouse on assignment to take pictures of a defendant in a charter school fraud case when the shooting started; he was able to capture two photos of the suspect through a telephoto zoom lens before taking cover behind a pillar adjacent to the entrance. He took a video and additional photos of the scene after the suspect had been shot by law enforcement officers. Perpetrator Brian Isaack Clyde, a 22-year-old male, was a private first class in the U.S. Army, and was honorably discharged after serving as an infantryman from August 2015 to February 2017. According to The Dallas Morning News, he was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. He was not deployed to a war zone during his time in the military. At the time of the shooting, Clyde had recently graduated from Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Texas, with an associate degree in applied science in nondestructive testing technology. Although Clyde had not been of \\"investigative interest\\" to the FBI, his half-brother had contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) three years before the shooting, alleging that Clyde was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The FBI did not follow up on the tip because there was no specific threat specified. Investigations into his social media history took place. =Motive= Clyde appears to have self-radicalized online, posting memes related to the incel subculture that appeals to men who feel lonely and alienated, and, ultimately, getting \\"sucked into a hateful vortex that tells them that their lives are only valuable if they go out bringing death\\" to others. Clyde had uploaded extremist far-right memes including ideas about the Confederate States and Nazism. Some of his posts were transphobic and others were anti-feminist. In April 2019 he posted a meme suggesting that combining eco-friendly and libertarian ideas with far-right authoritarianism, symbolized by what the Daily Beast describes as \\"a green flag with a Nazi swastika in the middle\\", could be the \\"solution to all of our nation‚Äôs political problems.\\" Clyde's family believed that it was a case of suicide by cop. Aftermath A Maryland Air Force base was inspired by the Dallas shooting to initiate a program teaching personnel to recognize the warning signs that \\"introverted, sexless individuals\\" may be drawn to the \\"incel\\" online subculture. On March 18, 2020, a man pleaded guilty to threatening to assassinate the governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham. He cited Clyde as an inspiration for his desired attack. On May 4, 2020, Tom Fox was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography for his photographs of several people fleeing, Clyde himself, and Clyde being attended to, respectively. However, the prize went to Reuters for their photography of the 2019 Hong Kong protests.

At the same time, a privilege in the form of letters patent granted in the King's Council, most often to the bookseller, guaranteed not the content, but the property of the publication against the counterfeiters. This renewable privilege was for three years, or even without limitation for certain basic works (fathers of the Church, etc.). Brochures of up to 48 pages in-12 were the subject of a simple permission granted by the lieutenant general of police of the place.  Object of censorship  Royal Privilege affixed on an engraving of Gregoire Huret for the Theater of the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ Censorship was provided by specialists in a number of areas, from the humanities to the sciences in general. They were appointed by the Chancellor. Their judgment related to the content of the proposed manuscript and not to the form. They could ask the author for some corrections.  History of prior censorship  Richelieu was the first to appoint experts assigned to this task by the edict of 1629. After the Fronde, Colbert created a direction of the Bookstore, responsible for ensuring the granting of permissions and privileges now mandatory for all impressions made in France. In 1701, Abbe Bignon, in charge of the bookstore business, promulgated a regulation of publishing in France which, modified in 1723 for Paris and generalized in 1744, remained in force until the French Revolution. Every manuscript must obtain the approval of a censor to obtain the editing privilege. Some manuscripts were however edited secretly under false address. This was the case of the Philosophical Letters of Voltaire or √âmile, or De l'√©ducation de Rousseau. But most authors wishing to avoid censorship were publishing their books abroad: London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Basel, Geneva. The regulation stipulated that books could cross the border only by certain cities and after examination.Ren√© Pomeau et Jean Ehrard, Litt√©rature fran√ßaise, T.5 de F√©nelon √† Voltaire, p. 30-34 But there was no provision to suppress smuggling.  Organization of censorship  The royal censors were appointed by the Chancellor, each in his specialty. The Royal Almanac published the list every year.  Main royal censors  * Michel Adanson * Nicolas Andry de Boisregard * Charles de Beaumont, knight of √âon * Pierre Jean Boudot * Jean-Baptiste-Michel Bucquet  Charles-Nicolas Cochin the Younger  Jean-Marie-Louis Coup√© * Louis Cousin * Claude Delisle * Jean- Nicolas D√©meunier * Desfontaines-Lavall√©e * Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle * Augustin Fran√ßois Jault  Jean-Louis-Ignace de La Serre * Guillaume-Chr√©tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes * Jean-√âtienne Montucla * Jean-Baptiste Robinet * Antoine Yart  Theatrical censorship  As early as 1701, the plays were in turn the subject of royal censorship: read before publication by the censors under the authority of the lieutenant general of police, the pieces were authorized either as such and received approval, or with cuts or corrections, when they were not simply prohibited. Voltaire paid the price for his Mohammed (1743), Sedaine for his Deserter (1769); The Barber of Seville and the Marriage of Figaro de Beaumarchais escaped only thanks to the obstinacy of Marie Antoinette.

She was elected to the Swiss parliament (\\"Nationalrat\\" / \\"Cussegl naziunal\\") on 18 October 2015, becoming Switzerland's youngest member of parliament in the process. Most of her political interventions to date have involved environmental issues. Provenance Lisa Mazzone was born in Geneva, the largest city in the francophone western part of Switzerland. She grew up in nearby Versoix, where she attended school and where until 2011 Luigi Mazzone, her father, Sergio Mazzone, served as a city councillor, representing the \\"Geneva Ecologist Party\\" (\\"Parti √©cologiste de Gen√®ve\\"). He is also a retired installer of solar panels. Her mother died in 2013: she had worked as a psychiatrist. Three of Lisa Mazzone's four grand parents emigrated from Italy to work at the CERN (\\"European Organization for Nuclear Research\\" / \\"Organisation europ√©enne pour la recherche nucl√©aire\\") which occupies a large site straddling the Franco- Swiss frontier a short distance to the north of Geneva. Along with her Swiss passport she also carries an Italian passport. Her paternal grandmother, born Beatrice Gmur, who also worked at the CERN, came originally from St. Gallen, a politically conservative canton in eastern Switzerland. Parliaments In 2006, aged 18, Mazzone took part in the establishment of the Youth Parliament (\\"parlement des jeunes\\") at Versoix. She became a member of the national committee of the Swiss Federation of Youth Parliament in 2007/08. She joined the Green Party in 2008. She served as president of the Geneva party between March 2014 and March 2016. She then became Party Vice-President for the Suisse Romande region in succession to Robert Cramer on 16 April 2016. Bicycles and transport Many of the slopes around the foreshore at the western end of Lake Geneva are reassuringly gentle: Lisa Mazzone became a passionate advocate for cycling when she was barely a teenager. She worked as a co-ordinator for the Geneva Pro-V√©lo association between 2010 and 2014. In 2014 she stepped down from that job in order to become Project Manager with the association. Since April 2015 she has also been vice-president at the \\"National Association for Transportation and the Environment\\" (\\"Association transports et environnement\\"). She has subsequently become the association's president for the francophone region surrounding Geneva. Political representative Mazzone sat as a municipal councillor (\\"Conseil communal\\") in Le Grand- Saconnex - the multi-cultural central Geneva municipality which includes both the city airport and several major United Nations facilities within its boundaries - from 2011 till June 2013. 2013 was also the year in which she graduated from the University of Geneva with a Bachelor en Lettres degree in Latin and French. As she later explained to an interviewer, that was when she decided to devote herself 100% to her favourite pastime, political and social (\\"associatif\\") engagement. Later that year, on 6 October 2013, she was elected to membership of the Grand Council of Geneva (\\"Grand Conseil de Gen√®ve\\" / cantonal parliament) for the five-year term ending in 2018. The 2013 election had left the Green Party with just 10 of the 100 Grand Council seats. Within the Geneva parliament she was a member of the transport commission and of the energy commission, becoming chair of the latter in December 2014. In March 2014 she had become leader of the Green Party team. Stop bunkers Because of the country's exceptionally precautionary cold war era building regulations, far more Swiss homes and offices feature their own underground nuclear bunkers than equivalent buildings elsewhere in Western Europe. In February 2015 Lisa Mazzone came to prominence as a leader in the Grand Council of a small group of deputies supporting the so-called \\"stop bunkers\\" movement. The issue concerned the extent to which the city authorities, in defiance of building regulations stating that premises with a floor below ground level could not be used as living accommodation, had been using nuclear bunkers to accommodate asylum seekers. The \\"stop bunkers\\" protesters included (but were not restricted to) asylum seekers being accommodated underground who were complaining about lack of sunshine or ventilation, terrible and rotting food, the impossibility of sleeping under the 24-hour lighting and in the noisy conditions, and the indestrucability of the bed bugs. National parliament Lisa Mazzone was elected to the Swiss parliament (\\"Conseil national\\" / \\"Consiglio Nazionale\\") on 18 October 2015, becoming Switzerland's youngest member of parliament. She delivered her ten-minute maiden speech to the National Council on 30 November 2015, which was her first day in the parliament. Under the relevant cantonal legislation, election to the national parliament had meant resignation from the Grand Council of Geneva on 12 November 2015. At the time of her election she told an interviewer: * \\"My orientation, based on my personal values, moves me towards considerations about free time and about sharing - as regards 'things', wealth and knowledge. It is time to move on from the strict focus on economic productivity which prevails today ... the [political] left must launch its own initiatives, project and referendums, and not spend its time on the defensive\\". In October 2018 Mazzone announced that in the 2019 national elections she would stand not for re-election to the National Council (\\"Conseil national\\" - lower house) but as a candidate for election to the Council of States (Switzerland) (\\"Conseil des √âtats\\" / \\"Cussegl dals Stadi\\"), which is the upper house of the national parliament. The relationship between the two chambers of the Swiss national parliament is roughly analogous to that between the German Bundesrat (upper house) and Bundestag (lower house). In the elections for the \\"Conseil des √âtats\\" she is hoping to win the seat made vacant by the recently announced retirement from the chamber of her party colleague Robert Cramer. The elections in question are scheduled for October 2019. Beyond parliament Much of Lisa Mazzone's most visible political activity still takes place outside parliament. She chairs the organisation \\"Regional Co-ordination for a Geneva city airport respectful of the environment and of the residents\\" (\\"Coordination r√©gionale pour un a√©roport de Gen√®ve urbain, respectueux de l'environnement et de la population\\" / CARPE) which in December 2016 tabled a cantonal \\"people's initiative\\", backed by 14,450 signatures, calling for \\"democratic control in respect of Geneva airport\\" (\\"Pour un pilotage d√©mocratique de l'a√©roport de Gen√®ve\\"). She is co-president, along with Priska Seiler Graf of the Social Democratic Party in Z√ºrich, of the \\"Environment and Health Coalition for responsible air transport\\" (\\"Coalition environnement et sant√© pour un transport a√©rien responsable\\" / CESAR) created in September 2016 by 20 like-minded Swiss associations and organisations. In March 2017 she became one of two co-presidents of the CIVIVA, a national organisation which makes arrangements for an extended period of alternative public service (\\"Service civil\\" / \\"Zivildienst\\") to be performed by male citizens unwilling, for reasons of conscience, to undertake the normal terms of (otherwise compulsory) military service. Since May 2018 she has also served as president for the Swiss section of the Society for Threatened Peoples which emerged in 1970 from the Hamburg-based \\"Aktion Biafra-Hilfe\\" movement.

Biography Coffin was born in Alton, New Hampshire, and attended Oberlin College. He taught in Chester, Ohio, where future U.S. president James Garfield was one of his students. with Coffin moved to Webster County, Iowa, in 1854, where he engaged in farming and social reform causes. He is credited with building the first round barn in Iowa, in 1867. Coffin was an early farm news editor for the Fort Dodge Messenger and served on a variety of boards and associations, including the Iowa State Fair, Iowa Stock Breeders Association, Iowa Farmers' Alliance, Farmers Protective Association, and the National Dairy and Food Association. He was also a leader in establishing farmers' mutual insurance companies, and agricultural extension education. He served in the Civil War as a minister, from 1862-63. Coffin served as Iowa's immigration agent, and as the state's first Railroad Commissioner, from 1883 until 1888. He established the Railroadmen's Temperance Movement, was involved with the Railroadmen's YMCA movement, helped establish the Railroadmen's Retirement Home in Highland Park, Illinois, and served as president of its board of directors. Coffin supported Prohibition in the United States, served on the Iowa Anti-Saloon League, ran as a Prohibitionist for governor of Iowa in 1906, and was the vice-presidential candidate on the United Christian Party ticket in 1908. Coffin was also involved with the prison reform movement. He also established a home for unwed mothers under the auspices of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Railroad worker safety Coffin realized that railroad workers were being injured at a high rate using link-and-pin couplers, devices which were locked by a brakeman dropping a pin between two iron loops as they came together. Injuries also often occurred to workers sitting on the top of moving rail cars setting hand brakes. In 1873, Eli Janney had patented an automatic coupler that locked like two hands clasping, and in 1872, George Westinghouse had developed a workable air brake that could stop a train from controls in the locomotive, but the railroads would not adopt these devices since they cost too much money. In 1886 and 1887, Coffin scheduled a series of tests of the Westinghouse air brake, but the tests failed to produce the desired results. Later in 1887, Coffin scheduled another series of tests, this time on a long grade outside Burlington, Iowa. A Chicago, Burlington & Quincy steam locomotive started downgrade with 50 cars rolling behind it. When the train hit 40 mph, the engineer put on the air. The freight shuddered to a dead stop within 500 feet. The air brakes had worked.\\"Lorenzo Coffin\\". by Richard F. Snow, October/November 1979 Coffin then turned his efforts to getting a federal law enacted requiring all railroads in the United States to adopt air brakes and automatic couplers as mandatory equipment on all railroad cars. Almost six years later, in 1893, President Benjamin Harrison signed the Railroad Safety Appliance Act, requiring mandatory air brakes and automatic couplers on all US railroad cars. Harrison gave the pen he used to sign the bill into law to Coffin.

Only one was built, but that car went through three styling iterations. History David Gittens is a Brooklyn-born artist and designer who was a staff photographer at Car and Driver magazine from 1958 to 1964. In 1964 he married and moved to London England, where he did photographic work for advertising and weddings. In 1967 he embarked on a career in transportation design. Among his proposed projects were a gas-powered single seat city car, an electric city car, a Reliant-based three-wheeled car, an expandable six-wheeled vehicle, a small car based on the Mini Moke chassis, and a high-performance mid-engined grand touring car that became the Ikenga GT. Gittens bought a used McLaren chassis from Ken Sheppard. Sheppard was also to handle limited production of the car. For development Gittens turned to Charles Williams of Williams & Pritchard coachbuilders. Financing of the project was arranged through Copleys merchant bank. The car's name is of Nigerian origin. Ikenga is a spirit often represented by a horned statue in Gittens' ancestral Igbo culture. Ikenga represents human achievement, accomplishment and success. The first version of the car, later referred to as the Mk1, was completed in 1967. The somewhat blocky design of the Mk1 was quickly followed by the restyled MkII in 1968. In addition to the revised body shape, this version received a leather interior and an accompanying set of Gucci luggage. Some advanced lighting features were also introduced with the MkII. In October 1968, during the Earls Court Motor Show, the Ikenga MkII was displayed at the Banking Hall at Harrods. This location was chosen due to there being no provision for displaying experimental or prototype vehicles at the motor show venue. 30,000 people saw the car at the Banking Hall, including one who offered $53,000 for the prototype, and a Saudi prince who commissioned a unique version of the car to be called the \\"Bird of Peace\\" at a cost of $35,000. This special does not appear to have been built. Gittens planned a limited run of cars. Depending on the source, he planned 100 or 150 cars, priced at ‚Ç§9000 or US$16,800 each. Gittens also promoted the car in the United States. The MkII appeared on the cover of the April 1969 issue of Car and Driver magazine. In the summer of 1969 an American group made an offer for the US distribution rights to the car. One day later Charles Williams died suddenly. This was while the car was undergoing another restyling that would result in the MkIII. The car was transferred to the Radford coachworks to have the work completed with the assistance of Roger Nathan among others. The car was complete by October 1969. It appeared in an episode of the BBC series Tomorrow's World, then was sent to France where it was displayed at the 1969 Paris Auto Show. From there the car went to Italy, where it won an innovation award at the Turin Auto Show. In March 1970 the car appeared at the Swedish International Motor Show in Stockholm. Eventually the car was seized by creditors, and Gittens returned to the United States. Only one Ikenga GT was ever built. The car was displayed at the Manx Motor Museum for some time and then was sold at auction in 1998 and again in 2008. It is believed to be somewhere in the Middle East. Gittens would go on to use the name again for a line of gyroplanes called the Ikenga 530Z, one of which is part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. Features =Body and chassis= The Ikenga GT was built on a McLaren-Elva Group 7 chassis. The chassis model was a McLaren M1B. The aluminium bodywork was formed over the tubular steel frame. The body of the Ikenga was meant to be evocative of an African mask facing skyward. The cockpit canopy represented the \\"eyes\\" of the mask, the raised intake on the roof the \\"nose\\", and the rear deck lid the \\"mouth\\". =Engine and transmission= The chassis' original race-tuned Traco-Oldsmobile engine was replaced by a stock version of the lightweight 3.5 litre Rover V8 engine that had originally been designed by General Motors and used by their Buick and Oldsmobile divisions. Several references report that the car later had some version of a Chevrolet OHV V8 engine. Power output was estimated to have been . The car's transmission was the ZF 5-speed transaxle from the McLaren. =Innovations= The car had many advanced features, some of which were developed by Gittens and company, and some by the Imperial College. They included the following: * A rear deck lid that doubled as an air brake. * On-board television and rear-view camera * A luminescent roof lining * Fluorescent-tube headlamps * A telematics radio system to warn of road problems ahead * A collision warning system * Ultrasonic parking sensors * A tilt-away steering wheel =Performance= * Top speed was estimated to be . * The standing quarter-mile was covered in 12.5 seconds. * Acceleration from took 11.5 seconds.

The series explores multiple themes, related to everyday life and the problems and challenges faced in it. Season 1 explored themes like a fear of missing out (FOMO) caused by social media and late-night cravings for food. Season 2 explored more serious themes like personal and professional crises. Dhruv is seen reconnecting with an old friend and realising that they have grown apart. He is later seen quitting his job due to a loss of interest. Dhruv is then seen as being \\"aimless\\" while Kavya has received a promotion and a pay hike, which leads to fights as they realise the differences between them. Other themes explored in the second season include Kavya getting attracted to a biker on an office trip, homophobia and the possibility of considering one's parents as friends. Season 3 further explores Dhruv and Kavya's relationship (which had hit a rough patch at the end of Season 2) with them venturing into a long-distance relationship. They thus begin to face loneliness (due to staying apart from one another) and learn to deal with it. They eventually realize that they can also be happy with other people. The two of them also have additional responsibilities and pity themselves. They reconnect with childhood friends and Kavya faces the fear of losing a loved one, her neighbour's dog, Kaju. They both discuss the possibility of marriage and their views on the topic are explored through an episode consisting of flashbacks. While visiting their parents, they realize that they are growing old. Additionally, the season explores the social structures of the big cities, commenting on how the urbanisation results in a loss of humanity. =In other media= Season 1 of the series was published as a book by Penguin Random House in 2017. Reception Rohan Naahar of Hindustan Times gave it a rating of 4/5 and went on to write \\"[The show] relies more heavily on performances than most others\\". Soumya Rao, writing for Scroll.in, called the show \\"frequently charming, often relatable and never boring\\". Prakhya Nair of The Red Sparrow rated it 3.5 stars and recommended it to \\"anyone who wants to delve in a real relationship for a while\\". Anvita Singh, writing for The Indian Express, opines that \\"[The show] would have worked better if it had four episodes of 15 minutes each, instead of the eight episodes, each over 22 minutes long\\" and also critiqued that the second season lacked the show's \\"sweet-natured relatability\\".

M. reidi differs from the other two Margaropus species in that the setae around the posterior end of its body form a continuous fringe and, in comparison to Margaropus winthemi and Margaropus wileyi, its anal plates are more bluntly pointed.Jane B.

The ecological requirements of M. reidi are similar to those of M. wileyi, but differ abruptly from those of M. winthemi. The vegetation in the area where it is found is largely broadleaf forests and woodlands with a mean annual rainfall of over 900 mm (35 inches), a mean monthly maximum temperature that falls below 30¬∞C (86¬∞F) for a relatively short period and exceeds 35¬∞C (95¬∞F) during the hot season.Jane B.

The lake is about 20 miles west of the town of Whitefish. It is a popular lake for recreational activities including fishing, boating, swimming and cliff jumping, and hiking on the surrounding trails, and is notable for its great depth and unusual geology. The lake's surface area is over 1200 acres. The lake is located at roughly 3,500 feet above sea level. It is about 445 feet deep at its deepest point (though some cite its depth as being even greater), making it the second deepest lake in Montana and the deepest natural lake. Despite its large volume, the lake tends to be warm in late summer because its waters are darkly colored due to high levels of tannins (which are harmless). These cause the lake to absorb and retain more heat than comparatively clearer bodies of water in the region. Tally Lake is home to a number of fish species which make it a popular site for fishing. These include whitefish, perch, and brook, lake and rainbow trout.

It was first tabled in 2006 by the Minister of Labour Olga IIich of the British Columbia Legislature. It established British Columbia as the first province in Canada where drivers have to pay before they pump gas and must include provisions to add barriers between customers. An employee working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. must be accompanied by another employee between said time. The law introduced the pre-payment system combined with new training and education services for gas station workers. The Law was named for Grant De Patie, a gas station worker who was killed in 2005 by an underage drunken driver.  Background  On 8 March 2005, Grant De Patie, a gas station worker in Maple Ridge, British Columbia was dragged for seven kilometers under a stolen moving van driven by 16-year- old Darnell Pratt. Grant was writing down the license plate number as Darnell ran over him while stealing $12 worth of gasoline. Grant was dragged 7 kilometers before his body was dislodged from the moving van. Darnell Pratt was sentenced, as an adult, with manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years but was released in 2012 as earlier parole attempts had failed.  Legal effects  Grant's law consists of amendments to the Workers Compensation Act, Occupational Health and Safety Regulation, Section 4.22.1 & 4.22.2. * 4.22.1 Requires employers train new and young employees in safety precautions. It was required that two employees be present between an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift or that a barrier between an employee and a customer be placed. ** An amendment was made in 2012 allowing employers instead of having two employees working between 11 pm and 6 am, that timed-locks safes and video surveillance be required. * 4.22.2 Drivers must pay before they use a gas pump. All urban gas stations are required to have a pre-payment system in place to prevent gas- and-dash crimes.

Her first literary work, Amora (1989), is considered the first lesbian-feminist novel published in Mexico. She is also the author of poetry collections that refer to lesbian love, such as Corramos libres ahora (1986). Biography Rosamar√≠a Roffiel was born in Veracruz on August 30, 1945. She moved to Mexico City at age 20. Self-taught in journalism, she began her professional career at the newspaper Exc√©lsior, where she worked for more than 10 years, and later wrote for the political analysis magazine Proceso. In 1976, she was one of the founders of the first women's sexual assault support group in Mexico, Centro de Apoyo para Mujeres Violadas AC (CAMVAC). In 1979, after the victory of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, she left Mexico to coordinate the Sandinista publication El Trabajador for three years. In 1980 she returned to Mexico, and in 1982 she began to contribute to fem., the first feminist magazine in Latin America. In 1986 she left journalism to work as a production coordinator on foreign films. The same year, she published Corramos libres ahora, a collection of poems on lesbian themes. She followed this with !Ay Nicaragua, Nicarag√ºita!, a series of testimonies about her time in that country. In September 1989 she published Amora, a literary work which has been recognized as Mexico's first lesbian-feminist novel. In an interview, Roffiel recalled that she had begun writing it in 1982. Amora Narrated in first person, Amora is set in Mexico City, and tells, in a simple way, the difficulties women experience in an environment that is heavy with machismo. It is a story based on the experiences of the author, with some fictitious elements, which highlight the relationships among a group of women living under one roof, describes how sexuality is discovered through coexistence, and how the women must act under a patriarchal system that oppresses them. The style and influence of Roffiel's work have been compared to that of Guadalupe Loaeza and Rosario Castellanos.

Memory is Everpresently Alive: Essays from the History of the Village Radowell and its School. - Kyiv (soon to be published) Until recently, it was thought that the first mention of the school dated back to 1899. It was evidenced by the handwritten document \\"Case No. 8604\\", which is stored in the Central State Historical Archives of Ukraine (Kyiv), and by the handbook \\"School of the Kiev Educational District\\", which is preserved in the National Library named after V. I. Vernadskyi, in the department of the historical works. The latter contains a list of teachers from the Ovruch district for the year 1908, among which there is mention of a Radowell Church Parish School teacher. However, in 2018, the Lyceum requested documents from the Zhytomyr State Regional Archives which could provide an earlier mention of the school‚Äôs existence. Upon the request, the following two official documents were received: \\"The Judgment of Radowell and Zhubrovychi Rural Communities\\" and \\"Report on the State Church Parish School of the 4th Deanery district in the Ovruch county, the first-world section of the Zhubrovychi volost in the village of Radowell for 1897-1898\\", which revealed the actual date of the school's opening ‚Äî October 6, 1886. The first Radowell school was a church parish institution. It had one classroom with a three-year term of study. There was no separate school building. The children studied in 2-3 ordinary rural huts. In 1920, the Radowell three-year school system was reorganized into a four-year system. As of December 15, 1927, there were 64 students taught by one teacher in Radowell. In 1935-1936, under the directorship of Stanislav Dembytskyi, the first wooden two-story school building was built and operated in the village of Radowell. At that time, new young specialists joined the teaching staff. In 1937, the school received the status of a seven- year school, and a year later, that of a secondary school. In June 1941, the first graduation of the 10th grade students (16 graduates) was held, and in July, the school was forcibly shut down because of the war. The school building survived and on January 1, 1944 the institution resumed its normal function. Despite the fact that in the post-war years the financial situation of the school and students was extremely dire, the Radowell school kept working, and specialists arrived in the village, including teachers. In the photo of the teaching staff of 1952, in the book Memory is Eternally Alive: Essays from History of the Village Radowell and its School by Nina Veselska, there are 20 teachers. The first post-war graduation took place in 1954, and 28 students received diplomas. At that time, those who graduated from the 7th grade were enrolled in university based on their Math and Ukrainian language exam results. Their studies were self-funded, however this practice was abolished in 1957. It is noteworthy that for more than 10 years, most of the seniors of Radowell, coming from neighboring villages, stayed in boarding schools or lived with their relatives. The boarding school shut down in 1987, when it was no longer necessary for students to come to Radowell from other villages. In 1962, the school building was renovated. In the 1961-1962 academic year, there was no 10th grade graduation, as children continued their studies into 11th grade. It is interesting that in 1965-1966 three classes graduated at once, namely two 10th grade classes and one 11th. For the following 24 years, no more students graduated from the 11th grade. In the 1960s and 1970s, work at the school was organized into two shifts (morning and evening classes for different students). The number of students in the 1970s exceeded 700 people. Some integral parts of school life were the sanitary and football teams, numerous excursions, hiking trips, student government, an amateur art school and educational research at the highest level. The school had 2.5 acres of land, of which 0.6 acres were designated for agricultural purposes, where different types of vegetables, typical of the Polissia region, were grown. The remaining 1.9 acres were used as an orchard. The flax seed from this land was exhibited at the All-Ukrainian Agricultural Exhibition in Kyiv. Radowell kept in touch with the Zhytomyr regional center of youth and the Zhytomyr Agricultural Institute‚Äôs scientific department, both of which provided the school with new potato varieties for several years. In the 1960s and 1970s, the school had its own truck, tractor and a pair of horses. High school students were taught driving and mechanics and received appropriate certificates for both. Active students of the school took part in social initiatives (production of birdhouses for Radowell Forestry, collecting metal scrap, paper waste and ash). In the village council, the school had its own student account, which held student-earned money used for various school activities. In 1983, as the school worked in two shifts, did not have a water supply and was heated by a furnace system, a new three-story school was built with a capacity for 625 students. The principal of the school at that time was N.M. Veselska. The process of learning in two shifts ended and all classes were transferred to the cabinet system. The school had a spacious dining room, locker room, a greenhouse, an industrial training workshop, sports and assembly halls and a military shooting gallery. Through the effort of the pedagogical team (L.M. Saiko, K.M. Drobot, V.I. Nevmerzhytska, T.U. Kravchenko and others) all the study rooms and the school library were equipped with necessary learning material, and a small museum of labor and military glory was created. The school dining room provided the students with free breakfasts and lunches. Internal lavatories, treatment facilities, a boiler room, a water tower, a greenhouse were in operation. During the 90s and 2000s, the school facilities were improved. In November 2001, Radowell Secondary School was the first among rural schools in the district to open a computer lab, which was funded by one of its graduates of the year 1986, Mykhaylo Veselskyy. At the same time, the number of students decreased. While in 1985-1986, 326 students studied in Radowell Secondary School, in 2008-2009, the number of students decreased to 188. As for the teaching staff, over 260 teachers worked at Radowell, around 70 of which were graduates of the school. Some teachers worked at the school for a few years, and some made teaching at Radowell a lifelong profession. On May 8, 2018, the Olevsk Regional Council reorganized the school into the Biotechnological Lyceum \\"Radowell\\". On September 15, the new school was officially opened. On October 5, a teacher portrait gallery was opened to honor and memorialize those who taught throughout the history of Radowell. The creator of the gallery is Nina Mykhailivna Veselska.  Modernity. The Concept of Lyceum  The Drama Club hall Within the years August 2017 to September 2018, a team managed to reconstruct the building of the educational institution in accordance with the concept of the ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù Lyceum. The ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù project was initiated by philanthropist Mykhaylo Veselskyy, who was born in Radowell and graduated from the school. The concept was formed with the joint effort of Irina Chudovska and Olexandr Horodnychyi, later joined by an architect who designed the lyceum. ‚ÄúThere were 28 variants of the functional plan of the school, but while building, I made some changes‚Äù. The basis of the conception of ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù is forming strong character traits based on spiritual values. Lyceum has created preconditions for: * Acquiring academic knowledge * Physical development * Development of creativity The design of the Lyceum was developed in accordance with the core values stated above. All necessary conditions for the development of children have been created. The classrooms are supplied with technical and technological equipment, including interactive panels of the new generation \\"EdPro\\" with the exclusive educational platform MozaBook, that allows teachers and students to perform interactive tasks with game elements, study educational content, get acquainted with thematic 3-D models, conduct experiments, etc. There are more than 10 studios and workshops at the Lyceum. The Culinary Studio, Studio of Design and Sewing, Robotics Studio, Art Studio and Ceramic Studio, Wood and Metal Workshops, Drama Club, Dance Studio, Taekwon-Do and Gymnastics Halls are full of modern furniture, bright design and functional equipment. The outdoor sports grounds are still in the process of being built. On May 25, 2019, the football pitch with artificial turf according to international standards was officially opened. School dining room ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù is committed to providing a safe educational environment for each student, without any manifestations of violence, psychological discomfort, violation of rights and norms, physical and social security. Experienced psychologists work on issues of safe interaction between all students and adults. In addition, comfortable sanitary and hygienic conditions are present. There are high-quality healthy meal plans in accordance with modern dining standards. The Lyceum introduces new recipes from the handbook for school dining rooms by Yevhen Klopotenko. As a result, the Biotechnological Lyceum ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù is an up-to-date, new educational space, designed for the comprehensive development of students. It is a safe educational environment with many positive reviews from current media. In these reviews, the Lyceum has been called the ‚Äúspaceship‚Äù and the dining room has been referred to as a real ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù.  Educational Approach  The educational process at BTL ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù is driven by the basic principles, based on the following types of intelligence, held by both children and adults: * IQ ‚Äì problem solving and the development of critical thinking * EQ ‚Äì implementation of creative thinking as well as art in the educational process that allows for emotional intelligence * Spatial intelligence ‚Äì emphasis on physical education, the development of movement, space orientation, rhythms and choreographic skills * Linguistic intelligence ‚Äì actualization of the effective methods for studying foreign languages * Mathematical intelligence ‚Äì the development of logical thinking and mathematical imagination * Musical intelligence ‚Äì playing musical instruments, singing * Social intelligence ‚Äì appropriate trainings, master classes and workshops that allow students to work in teams and interact with social organizations and institutions  Uniqueness  The school week in BTL \\"Radowell\\" begins with The Meeting Day ‚Äî a morning Monday tea ‚Äî for which children themselves bake biscuits in the Culinary Studio. The purpose of tea drinking is to energize students for the whole week, promote understanding and build trustworthy relationships among children, as well as between children and teachers. Other initiatives include: * Cinema Day (cartoons and films are offered not only for lyceum students, but also for their parents to watch) * Project Day (as a rule, jointly developed projects of teachers and students deal with biotechnology, educational disciplines, community development) * Parents' Day when parents can attend classes with their children, gather parental councils to resolve urgent issues, etc. * Leadership Day on which the Lyceum students assist teachers to conduct lessons, and class leaders have their parliamentary sessions. The core principles of child development in the Lyceum are relationship equality, innovation, openness, integration (interdisciplinary and that of knowledge and skills with real world application) and initiative. In the creation of necessary preconditions for child development in the Lyceum, extra effort is given to foster teachers‚Äô professional growth, parents‚Äô development and community progress. Active cooperation among teachers, parents and children is strongly encouraged.  Symbolics of the Lyceum  The Biotechnological Lyceum \\"Radowell\\" has a flag and coat of arms. The latter consists of a graphic representation of the Lyceum building and the logo in the form of the original title. The Lyceum also has a school uniform. Students of the Lyceum participated in designing the uniform, which consists of polos, sports pants, hoodies and baseball caps, with the name of the institution affixed to each article of clothing. There are 2 types of uniforms, namely \\"festive\\" and \\"causal\\". The holiday uniform is white (a polo and a baseball cap). The casual uniform has three colors (depending on the class): the elementary school is green, secondary school is blue, and high school is burgundy. The teaching staff, the Lyceum administration and other personnel also work in uniform (dark blue, green and white).

It was built for Thomas Fraser of Kinnell the alleged son of the 4th Lord Lovat (as he does not appear in genealogies if true he is an illegitimate son) and is a good example of a fortified laird's house of this period. The date 1581 forms part of a marriage lintel that combines the armorial crests of the Frasers of Lovat with that of the Kinnaird family, also bearing the initials TF and CK. In 1602 Thomas is married to Jane Kinnaird rather than C. Kinnaird. By the mid-17th century the castle passed to Patrick Gray and his family. From the Grays it then passed to the Ogilvie family.

Development Nieuport 17bis prototype in French markings. The forward rake of the front cabane struts is evident Nieuport 17bis from above showing off the square ailerons. The Nieuport 17bis designation was initially used by Nieuport for a Nieuport 11 variant that had been retrofitted with the wings and side fairings from a Nieuport 17, however this type was not produced in any numbers and the designation was reused. The Nieuport 17bis was the first of the vee strut scouts to feature a fully streamlined fuselage, with longitudinal stringers to fair out the shape. Other than the changes to the fuselage, minimal alterations were made, and unlike the later 24, 24bis and 27, the flying surfaces remained the same as used on the 17, as was much of the internal structure. Unlike the 17, or any of the other Vee strutters, it had the Vickers Machine Gun offset to the port (left) side of the centerline.Westrop, 2006, p.158 Due to shortages of Le Rh√¥ne rotaries, they were fitted with the Clerget 9B rotary instead of the lighter Le Rh√¥ne 9J used in most of the other Nieuport single seat scouts. A few examples were fitted with the lower powered Clerget 9Z. As a result of the Clerget's slightly greater diameter, the cowling was ballooned out slightly to provide clearance. The majority of Nieuport 17bis were operated by 6 (Naval) Squadron, who tested them against a Sopwith Triplane and a Sopwith Camel. It was found to have similar manoeuvrability to the Triplane and have a higher dive speed, but was slightly slower at altitude and had heavier controls.Westrop, 2006, p.25 Climb rates varied, and in the first test the 17bis outclimbed the Triplane by a significant margin, however in the second test the times to altitude were identical between the two types. The Camel was marginally faster at sea level but had a lower rate of climb while the speed advantage gradually disappeared with altitude.Westrop, 2006, p.30 Adding a Lewis machine gun to the Vickers reduced the climb rate, and increased the time it took to climb to by 2 minutes.Westrop, 2006, p.31 Initial reports were impressive, but the Clerget engines lost power quickly between overhauls, and the problem was worse with the British built engines. Many pilots tried to have French-built engines in their aircraft.Westrop, 2006, p.159 Some aircraft were also delivered to units with incorrect propellers, which also hampered performance. =Triplane= At least one 17bis was built as a triplane in the same manner as the Nieuport 17 triplanes, with the wings staggered with the middle wing furthest forward, and the lowest wing furthest aft. Flight testing discovered that it was longitudinally unstable but handled well otherwise, but the concept was not pursued further. =Nieuport 23bis= The Nieuport 23bis was a later but in many ways a similar development to the 17bis and was the result of the RFC's desperation to get as many aircraft as possible into front line service, but only 17 were produced and all went to the RFC.Knight, 2011, pp.148 It combined the flying surfaces including the tail of the 23 with the fuselage of the 24bis, and was fitted with other Nieuport 23 parts, such as an earlier form of cowling. Unlike the 17bis, it retained the Le Rh√¥ne normally used by Nieuport scouts. =Distinguishing features= The 17, 17bis, 23 and 23bis flying surfaces had the front spar positioned further forward than on the later types.Knight, 2011, p.149 Aside from the lack of a plywood leading edge to the wing, the key identifying feature was the rake of the forward cabane struts connecting the top wing to the fuselage.Knight, 2011, pp.148-149 On the 17, 17bis, 21, 23 and 23bis, the cabane struts were angled forward from the fuselage, while on the 24, 24bis, 25 and 27, they were angled aft. Both the 17bis and the 23bis used the square ailerons, rather than the rounded ailerons used on production versions of the later types. Operational history Aside from one example being flown by Charles Nungesser and marked with his personal serial number N1895, the Nieuport 17bis saw little service with the French A√©ronautique Militaire. The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was the primary operator of the Nieuport 17bis, with 6 (Naval) Squadron being the only unit wholly equipped with the type. It primarily replaced the obsolete Nieuport 10 and the Nieuport 11 and would in turn be replaced by the Sopwith Camel. The RNAS received 82 examples, of which 32 were from Nieuport (including 1 triplane) and 50 from Nieuport & General Aircraft who built them under licence in the UK. The British-built examples were delivered so slowly that the type had been declared obsolete before most were even delivered and only 4 were known to have been used operationally. As a consequence, most were never removed from their crates, and were scrapped without having been flown.

She sailed between New York and Liverpool carrying immigrants to the US for the Red Cross Line. She was lost at sea with no known survivors after setting sail from Liverpool 12 February 1856. 377 lost their lives. Development and design Driver was constructed in Newburyport in 1854 for David Ogden et al. It seems likely that she was constructed by Currier and Townsend as were the other clippers owned by David Ogden that sailed for the same Red Cross Line. Question has been raised over her characterisation as a true clipper ship due to her less clipper like hull shape, however her sail plan was lofty and heavily sparred allowing her to reach great speed. Advertisements of the day certainly described her as a clipper ‚Äì \\"The magnificent first-class extraordinary fast-sailing American- built Clipper Ship DRIVER.\\" Service history Driver made four successful return voyages between New York and Liverpool under the captaincy of Nicholas Holberton. He was an experienced captain who had been the master of the ships Noemi and Andrew Foster for the same shipowners. The ship left Newburyport on 7 September 1854 for St John's New Brunswick, then to Liverpool. She arrived in England for the first time 28 October 1854. After what seems to have been a number of aborted starts due to leaks, Driver left for her first westward voyage to New York on 25 January 1855. Passage on the ship was advertised by the Tapscott's line for travel to New York. Freight was also carried. A berth could be booked for a family for ¬£1 deposit. Weekly provisions for the journey were 3lbs of good Navy bread, 1lb of flour, 2lbs of oatmeal, 1lb of beef, 1lb of pork, 1lb of peas, 1lb of rice, 1lb of sugar, 2oz of tea, 2oz of salt and a pint of vinegar for the voyage. Each adult was provided with 3 quarts of water daily. Utensils and bedding were to be provided by the passengers. These advertisements were run extensively and continued to include Driver in their shipping list even months after her loss. Driver arrived safely in New York on 14 February 1855. For the return voyage on 21 April she had 151 passengers on board. Many were returning emigrants. She arrived Liverpool 11 May 1855 and left again for New York on 8 June. She arrived in America after a voyage of 38 days on the 16 July. Her following journeys were as follows; left New York around 27 August 1855, to arrive back in Liverpool 19 September. Then she left Liverpool 17 October and arrived in New York before 27 November. While on her final eastward voyage to England, 17 year old seaman Peter Connolly stabbed able seaman William Henry Barnes during an altercation. Barnes died in hospital not long after their arrival in Liverpool on 19 January 1856. Connolly was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a month's imprisonment with hard labour. The judge considered this a lenient service for Connolly as the deceased was \\"a very violent man\\". Two passengers on board ship for this journey were convicted of theft from a fellow passenger. A box of goods worth ¬£350 was taken from Louis Sancan by John Flood and William Johnson. They were convicted after Mr Sancan identified his belongings in the accused home. Driver left Liverpool for on her final voyage on 12 February. She carried a crew of 6 officers, 22 men and 344 passengers. A full list of passengers and officers was published in the New York Herald of 22 June 1856. Loss at Sea Driver was never heard from again. She was presumed lost in the ice of the North Atlantic. Newspapers of the time reported that the ice was particular bad this year. Other ships encountered dangerous conditions, for example the G. B. Larmer was a day and half fixed in the ice and \\"narrowly escaped destruction\\". A possible sighting was made by the crew of ship Amazon on 28 April 1856. For a time this may have raised hopes that Driver was delayed. However the sighting was never confirmed. A number of other ships were lost around the same time, also presumed to be due to the ice. Notably the Ocean Queen set sail from London on 12 February 1856. She signalled 'all well' off the Isle of Wight on 15 February, but no other word was heard. She carried a crew of 33 and 90 passengers.

Research and career  Boldyreva was awarded an additional Doctorate in Science in solid-state chemistry in 2000. She was promoted to Professor at the Novosibirsk State University in 2003. Her early work considered photomechanical effects in crystals of coordination complexes. She shifted into high pressure research, working with infrared spectroscopy at the Phillips University in Marburg. Boldyreva has investigated solid pharmaceutical compounds and biomimetic molecules. She also worked at Durham University as a Royal Society Fellow. She uses high pressure measurements to investigate and control the inter- and intra-molecular interactions in crystals. She has shown you can use pressure to induce new crystalline forms, as well as interrogating chemical reactions. Alongside experimental science, Boldyreva works on Monte Carlo simulations for solid-state reactions. She serves on the advisory council of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. She is an editor for Acta Crystallographica, International Union of Crystallography Research Journal, CrystEngComm Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry and Pharmalogica. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2007 Award from the European Society for Applied Physical Chemistry * 2008 Elected to the International Union of Crystallography * 2012 Academina Women in Science * 2017 Elected to the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts * 2018 University of Edinburgh Honorary degree of Doctor of Science * 2018 Elected to the Academia Europaea = Books =  References  Category:1961 births Category:Living people ","title":"Elena Boldyreva"},{"id":"61076236","text":"Blow down may refer to: * Boiler blowdown, periodic release of water from a boiler to remove accumulated impurities * Windthrow, trees uprooted or broken by wind ","title":"Blow down"},{"id":"61076253","text":"Meƒëimurje Horse Stud () is a small stud farm comprising 20 acres in the northern part of Meƒëimurje County, Croatia.

Summary  Ghosts of Saltmarsh is an anthology of updated modules and adventures from previous editions, including three adventures from the classic ‚ÄòU‚Äô series. The modules are modified to use the fifth edition rules, so that the adventures can be played in the order they are presented in the book, or dropped into a home campaign. If played in order as a seafaring campaign, it takes characters from level 1 through level 12. The adventures included, in the order of presentation and including original publication year, are: * The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh (1981) * Danger at Dunwater (1982) * Salvage Operation (2005) * Isle of the Abbey (1992) * The Final Enemy (1983) * Tammeraut‚Äôs Fate (2004) * The Styes (2005) Additionally, the book contains rules for ship-to- ship combat and includes details on the port town of Saltmarsh which anchors each adventure.  Publication history  In February 2019, the adventure anthology was announced by Wizards of the Coast. Ghosts of Saltmarsh was released on May 21, 2019. An alternate art cover was available exclusively in local game stores. Beadle & Grimm, a Wizards of the Coast licensee, released a special edition called the \\"Sinister Silver Edition of Ghosts of Saltmarsh\\". It includes the Ghosts of Saltmarsh broken into individual booklets for each chapter, physical props (such as amulets and tea stained in-world letters), a custom Dungeon Master's screen for this book, thirty hanging encounter cards, laminated ship maps and other handouts (such as regional maps and setting art).  Reception  In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending 5/25/19\\", Ghosts of Saltmarsh was #6 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\". Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, wrote that the book is \\"geared at more veteran players\\" and that he \\"found it very cool to read through\\". Kunzelman highlighted that \\"the history of 'sea adventures' seems a little more mechanically complicated than your average adventure, and it seems like a DM would need to really encourage players in specific ways if they wanted to run these as anything other than dungeon delves with strange enemies not often seen on shore. These are adventures, and they‚Äôre good, but they‚Äôre good for very specific things. Check ‚Äòem out if you love boats\\". For Bleeding Cool, Gavin Sheehan wrote that \\"Ghosts of Saltmarsh is one of the best put-together books in the entire run of 5th Edition. I was a big fan of Yawning Portal as well, but this one feels like they took the lessons they learned from that book and refined them here. It takes a lot of work to mesh singular modules into a cohesive adventure, but [Mike] Mearls and Kate Welch (who served as the lead designers on this one) did a fantastic job. There‚Äôs very little to complain about in this book as everything in it is both versatile and succinct when it comes to adventure building and storytelling. And sure, there are people who will look at this and think 'I don‚Äôt feel like going out to sea' for their campaign, and that‚Äôs okay because some of these can be adapted easily to fit what you need if you feel like taking your DM‚Äôs tools to them\\". Christian Hoffer, for Comicbook, wrote that \\"the book contains a surprising amount of references and nods to its Greyhawk roots. Saltmarsh has three competing factions that strive for influence around town, and two of them have direct ties to outside Greyhawk forces. One group is loyal to the king of Keoland and uses imperial authority to exert its influence, while another is connected to the sinister Scarlet Brotherhood, a classic group of Greyhawk antagonists. The Sea Princes, another Greyhawk faction, also play a role in the book. [...] While Ghosts of Saltmarsh contains plenty of nods to its Greyhawk roots, the book is still 'setting agnostic' as DMs and players don't need to know anything about Greyhawk before they sit down to play the adventure. The factions provide connective tissue between the adventures in Ghosts of Saltmarsh, but players can easily approach the chapters of the books as standalone adventures or pull Saltmarsh out of Greyhawk entirely without any significant issue\\". On ship-to- ship combat, Brandes Stoddard, for Tribality, wrote that \\"most of what we saw in the [Unearthed Arcana] article of the same name seems to still be in place ‚Äì the same component/battle station format for ships and naval combat. Adding in grid maps for each ship type (galley, keelboat, longship, rowboat, sailing ship, and warship) and area descriptions for average vessels of those types is awesome. The system for officers and crew are likewise recognizable from the UA text. [...] It‚Äôs not hard to imagine how a series of unlucky rolls could put the PCs on the wrong end of a mutiny. I like that various significant failures are possible without automatically going to catastrophic failure. [...] On the downside, this is pages and pages of tables and text. On the upside, there‚Äôs a huge variety of stories available here, contained in various table and check results. This is easily the beating heart of an exploration game, and it doesn‚Äôt look like it would get repetitive in a hurry\\".

Mule production was an important industry in Poitou for three hundred years or more, and the number of mule foal births may have reached 30,000 per year. In the early twentieth century there were about 50,000 Poitevin Mulassier brood mares, which gave birth to some 18,000‚Äì20,000 mule foals per year. The Poitevin mule was well known for its size and strength, and was exported to many countries, among them Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Turkey; many traveled farther, to the Russian Empire and the United States. With the mechanisation of agriculture after the Second World War, demand for mules rapidly fell to low levels. By the 1990s the Poitevin Mulassier was critically endangered, and mares were mostly put to Mulassier stallions in order to increase breed numbers. Approximately twenty Poitevin mules are born each year. In 2017 there were 195 active Mulassier brood-mares. Of these, about 25% were covered by Baudet jacks; 26 mule foals were born. The Poitevin mule was recognised by the Haras Nationaux of France in 2002; a mule foal born to a registered and approved Baudet du Poitou jack and a registered Poitevin Mulassier mare is automatically eligible for registration in the stud-book of the Poitevin mule.

It is the fourth game in the Microsoft Golf series, following Microsoft Golf 3.0. The game uses a revamped design that is substantially different from its predecessors. Some critics considered the game to be a significant improvement over its predecessors, with particular praise for its graphics. Sales were poor, with the game ranking 232nd for computer game sales during 1998. It was followed by Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition. Gameplay Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition features four golf courses: The Links, and Teeth of the Dog, both at Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic; and Lake Michigan's Bay Harbor Golf Club, and The Preserve 9 at Bay Harbor. The latter is a 9-hole course, while the other three each contain 18 holes. The game features five game modes: Bingo Bango Bongo, match, scramble, skins, and stroke. Four golf swing methods are featured, including Natural Swing and Sim Swing; the former method uses the motion of a computer mouse to simulate the swing, while the latter option has the game take the swing for the player, who has no involvement in the process. The game also features regular two-click and three-click swing methods that are common to golfing games. The player can also choose pin placement, and has a variety of camera angles and replay options. Wind and weather can also be customized. The game includes commentary from David Feherty, who reacts to the player's golfing. Ten golfer models are featured, including males and females of varying skin tones, and the player can use a variety of options to customize the character. The game supports multiplayer for up to four players, with various options such as LAN and Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone. Development The previous games in the Microsoft Golf series are basic versions of the early Links golfing games by Access Software. Microsoft's previous golf games are also Microsoft Windows versions of the Links games, which were being published for DOS at the time. Microsoft and Access Software ended their partnership in 1996, when the latter began developing Links for Windows, making their series a direct rival to Microsoft Golf. For Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition, Microsoft chose Friendly Software to develop the game, which uses a revamped design that is substantially different from its predecessors. Friendly Software previously developed Greg Norman Ultimate Challenge Golf, and Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition uses the same game engine. The game uses DirectDraw for graphics rendering. DirectX: Description of the DirectX Setup (Dxsetup.exe) Tool Release and marketing The game was published by Microsoft in the United States in May 1998. That month, Microsoft and company Eddie Bauer partnered to promote Microsoft Golf 1998 Special Edition, a basic version of the game featuring only the Preserve 9 course. It was created specifically for Eddie Bauer. The Eddie Bauer logo and website are featured in the game, which was given away to Eddie Bauer customers who purchased merchandise costing $75 or more. A basic demo version of the full game, titled Microsoft Golf 1998 Lite and featuring only the Preserve 9 course, was included with Microsoft Plus! 98 upon its release in June 1998. In August 1998, Microsoft hosted a promotional media event at Washington's Museum of Flight, coinciding with the 1998 PGA Championship being held in the state, where Microsoft was headquartered. The event, titled \\"Battle in Seattle\\", was a three-hole matchup between professional golfers Craig Stadler and Michelle McGann, who competed against each other in the game. The event included a jumbo screen to watch the match, as well as 10 computers featuring demo versions of the game. The event garnered only about 80 people, below Microsoft's expectations. Media attendees included ESPN and Fox Sports, in addition to several PGA Tour players. Reception Some critics considered Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition to be a significant improvement over its predecessors. Stephen Poole of GameSpot wrote that \\"the only way you'd know it had anything to do with the previous versions is from the name.\\" Scott A. May of Computer Gaming World praised the game for retaining \\"the polished, user-friendly feel of the previous versions, but little else.\\" He stated that veteran fans of the series would be surprised by Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition, while people who ignored its predecessors for their lack of depth \\"finally have a reason to take another look\\" at the series. Gordon Goble of Gamecenter stated that nearly everything about the series had been changed for the better with the release of Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition. Paul Rosano of Hartford Courant called it \\"a worthwhile and successful, albeit overdue, upgrade.\\" The graphics were praised, although some critics still considered them inferior when compared to Links LS 1998 and Jack Nicklaus 5. Poole considered the graphics to be \\"the biggest area of improvement,\\" stating that they were nearly as good as the latest Links and Jack Nicklaus games. May praised the video-captured golfers for being seamlessly blended into the foreground. Other critics praised the golfer animations as well, but were disappointed by the golfers' lack of pre- and post-shot reactions. Goble particularly praised the aerial previews of each hole, considering them to be the best of any golf game. May called the sounds on the course \\"outstanding\\" but stated that some sounds \\"seem to be missing,\\" such as the ball hitting the pin or splashing into water. Nick Smith of AllGame considered the sounds to be \\"very realistic\\" and stated that they \\"do not get in the way of the gameplay as they sometimes do in other golf games.\\" Goble criticized the ambient audio for including \\"annoying, perpetually chirping birds and crickets\\". Doug Pierce of Sports Gaming Network criticized the audio for its lack of variety and its repetitive sounds of birds and sprinklers. Smith enjoyed the commentary and called it \\"relevant and even sympathetic at times\\". May believed the commentary to be superfluous, while Poole stated that the commentary \\"isn't particularly humorous or helpful\\". Goble stated that the commentary was rarely accurate in its reaction to the player's golfing. Some criticized the game's click-swing methods for requiring fast responses from the player. May considered the array of swing methods to be \\"by far the most impressive\\" of the game's options. He also praised the pin placement option for significantly increasing the game's long-term playability. Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune considered the Natural Swing \\"anything but natural,\\" although he praised the various game options and the Internet Gaming Zone feature. Jeff Lackey of Computer Games Strategy Plus praised the multitude of game options, noting that some of them were not yet offered by rival golfing games. May praised the \\"clean\\" interface, while Poole praised it for providing quick access to parts of the game. Rosano praised the courses, including Teeth of the Dragon, as a \\"big plus,\\" while stating they were all \\"expertly rendered.\\" May was disappointed that the game, unlike its predecessors, is not compatible with courses from the Links series or the earlier Microsoft Golf games. Poole was also disappointed by the limited course selection, and the lack of an off- line tournament mode. Goble believed that the four available courses provided adequate variety, although he criticized some gameplay inconsistencies and errors, and stated that the distance to the golf hole can be \\"extremely deceiving\\" at times. In comparison to rival golf games, Goble called Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition a \\"promising amateur in a world of seasoned veterans.\\" He concluded that it was too flawed to \\"heartily recommend,\\" stating that at best, it was an \\"interesting alternative\\" in the genre of computer golf. Rosano concluded that the game was best for casual players, stating that there were better golf simulations available for hardcore players. Sales of the game were poor; among computer games, Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition ranked 232nd for sales during 1998.

These were to be the penultimate all-Cardiff elections before the creation of the county borough in 1889. The previous elections were in November 1886 and the final town council elections were to take place on 1 November 1888. The election saw the Liberals gain an extra four seats in Cardiff. Background Cardiff Town Council had been created in 1836. Elections were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because the six councillors in each ward stood down for election in three-yearly rotation. The council consisted of 30 councillors who were elected by the town's voters and ten aldermen who were elected by the councillors. Ten seats were up for election in November 1888. Overview of the result Contests took place in four of the five Cardiff electoral wards in November 1887. In the East ward the two councillors were elected unopposed. The weather was exceptionally poor on polling day, but the South Wales Echo reported a strong turnout of the town's Irish voters. There was also noticeably strong campaigning by the Liberal Party, with many carriages made available to transport 'lady voters' to the polling booths. =Council composition= The Liberal Party saw an increase of four seats, which made the composition of the council immediately following these elections as Conservatives 20, Liberals 19. There was one vacant alderman seat following the death of Alderman Jones. Whoever filled the post could affect the balance of the council. Ward results =Canton= =East= =Roath= In such a large ward there was only one polling station, in the schoolroom in Metal Street, but interest was much stronger than normal. =South= South had been regarded as a Conservative stronghold. However, with a 79% turnout and with Irish voters supporting the Liberals almost exclusively, the retiring Conservative councillors lost their seats. New councillor Beavan had stood unsuccessfully in November 1886 (previously representing the Canton ward). =West= There was considerable interest in the West ward election (with very large crowds at the results) because there had been no contest in the ward for many years. Mr Proger had represented the ward for nine years without having to fight a contest. * = 'retiring' ward councillor for re-election References Category:Council elections in Cardiff Category:19th century in Cardiff Category:1887 Welsh local elections ","title":"1887 Cardiff Town Council election"},{"id":"61076760","text":"Depraved is a 2019 American horror film written and directed by Larry Fessenden and starring David Call and Joshua Leonard.

It was released in the United States in late 1998. It is the fifth game in the Microsoft Golf series, following Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition, which was also developed by Friendly Software. Some critics noted similarities between the game and its predecessor. It was praised for its variety of options, although critics believed it was not as good as other golfing games. Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition was the best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 154,741 copies sold. It was followed by Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition. Gameplay Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition is similar to its predecessor, Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition. Improvements include more realistic chipping, better Internet support, and additional options for customization. The game features seven courses, including the following four from the previous game: The Links, and Teeth of the Dog, both at Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic; and Lake Michigan's Bay Harbor Golf Club, and The Preserve 9 at Bay Harbor. Among the new courses is the Donald Ross Memorial in Harbor Springs, Michigan, featuring different course holes designed by Donald Ross. The other new courses are Eagle Heights, a fantasy valley/woodland course set somewhere in the Pacific Northwest; and Medalist Golf Club, in Hobe Sound, Florida. Courses include various weather options relating to sky, wind, ground, and fog conditions. Five game modes are featured: Bingo Bango Bongo, match, scramble, skins, and stroke. The player is presented with a choice of 18 golf clubs, and can also customize the physical strengths and design of the onscreen golfer character. Included are two male models and two female models. The game has four golf swing methods, all previously featured in Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition. These include two-click and three-click swing methods, as well as Natural Swing and Sim Swing; the former uses computer mouse motion to execute the swing, while the latter option has the game make the swing on behalf of the player. The player can choose to take mulligans and gimmes. David Feherty provides commentary on the player's golfing. The game includes several multiplayer options, and also supported Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone at the time of its release. Reception Some critics noted similarities between Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition and its predecessor, believing that the biggest difference between the two was the addition of three new courses and some minor improvements. According to T. Liam McDonald of GameSpot, the game followed \\"the current trend among sports games of publishing a new edition every year and only revamping the whole system every couple years.\\" Jeff Lackey of Computer Games Strategy Plus considered the game to be more of a course add-on package for Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition, while PC Accelerator wrote that the game \\"is not a sequel so much as an expansion disc\\" for its predecessor; the magazine further stated that none of the game's minor improvements had a significant change on the overall game. Critics believed that the game was a good value when taking into consideration a rebate offer, which was available to consumers who purchased the previous Microsoft Golf game. The game's interface was praised as was the multiplayer and the variety of options. However, critics generally believed that there were better golfing games available, such as the Links series, the Jack Nicklaus series, and the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series. Lackey praised the golfer customization options, but concluded that there was \\"no good reason to pick this retread\\" over other golf games such as Links LS 1999 and Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf. Daniel Morris of GamePro also considered the game average and believed that Links LS 1999 was superior. Mike Snider of USA Today called it a \\"serviceable golf sim that doesn't make the cut\\". James Bottorff of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that other than the title, \\"it's hard to find anything different between this game and the countless other golf titles on the market.\\" Gordon Goble of Gamecenter believed it to be a reasonable choice for computer golfers considering its array of game options, but he also felt that there were better golf games available, as did Michael L. House of AllGame. House wrote that Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition has \\"too many irritating little bugs,\\" including an issue in which the game was not accurately aware of the golfer's location on the course. With the game's improvements over its predecessors, McDonald considered the Microsoft Golf series to now be the third best golf game series, behind Links and Jack Nicklaus. Trent C. Ward of IGN felt that other golfing games were superior in nearly every aspect, but concluded that the game was an \\"excellent choice for those looking for a quick and easy golf game without all the frills.\\" Brian R. Fitzgerald of The Wall Street Journal considered it a good game for beginners. The game uses DirectDraw for graphics rendering. Golf 1999 Edition: Minimum System Requirements Some critics considered the graphics to be average. McDonald believed that the courses were \\"detailed and finely rendered\\" but not as good as those featured in the Links and Jack Nicklaus games. He stated that the golfers \\"appear smoother, more realistic, and more fluid than ever.\\" Sports Gaming Network praised the graphics but considered those of Links LS 1999 to be superior, while mentioning that the golfers had \\"more fluidity\\" than any other golf game. Ward considered the graphics good but average, while stating that objects in the game suffered from \\"cardboard cutout syndrome.\\" Goble praised the graphics but believed that the game felt \\"stagnant\\" in some way: \\"Perhaps it's the hardened flags, static water, and spray-less sand traps, or the animation-free background and muted colors. Maybe it's the lack of viewing options--three in all, only two of which are available at any one time. Whatever it is, it's not easy to decipher wind direction or judge distances--all in all a disconcerting feel.\\" House considered the graphics to be very good for the most part, but he stated that they had an artificial feel. He further wrote, \\"It's disconcerting to see the flag on the green point one way when the wind meter is showing a strong breeze coming from the other direction.\\" The ball physics received some criticism. Lackey felt that the physics were acceptable but not as good as rival golf games. Sports Gaming Network considered the physics above average and realistic, but also not entirely convincing. Fitzgerald praised the club and ball physics, calling them \\"remarkably realistic, a tough feat for a lot of golf games.\\" For the swing methods, Ward felt that the Sim Swing was too complex but wrote that the Natural Swing \\"proved to be very cool indeed.\\" Goble considered the click-swing methods unnatural and frustrating, but called the Natural Swing \\"intriguing.\\" PC Accelerator felt that the swing meter was difficult to use. Snider called it a good game for beginners because of its Sim Swing feature. Sports Gaming Network considered the Sim Swing method boring, but praised the Natural Swing as an \\"easy to learn/tough to master\\" option. McDonald was disappointed that the game, unlike earlier Microsoft Golf games, is not compatible with courses from Links add-on disks. Sports Gaming Network was disappointed with the number of courses, but considered each of them to be impressive, and further stated that the game seemed to have the fastest loading times of any golf game available. Ward also praised the courses. The sound received some praise, although PC Accelerator also questioned how important sounds really are in a golf game. Morris considered the sound effects to be basic and wrote that the game was \\"a flat experience for the ears,\\" stating that it lacked the \\"aural flair\\" of its competitors. Fitzgerald stated that the sound effects included \\"weird moos and all sorts of animal cackles\\" as if each course was set on a farm. Goble considered the ambient sounds varied and enjoyable, but also \\"a bit bird-heavy.\\" He felt that the commentary was \\"arrogant and error-filled.\\" McDonald considered Feherty's shot-specific commentary good but stated that his \\"color commentary is hollow and annoying.\\" House noted an issue in which Feherty sometimes stuttered his commentary, while Bottorff stated that Feherty's commentary was \\"in perfect tune with the progression of the game.\\" Sports Gaming Network praised the commentary. Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition was the best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 154,741 copies sold, equaling a total of approximately $3.1 million in revenue.

She has served as Director of Training & Career Development as well as leading the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit. She is best known for her work on the safety of statins. Armitage led the 1999 Medical Research Council and British Heart Foundation Heart Protection Study, which included 20,000 participants. The study is the largest that investigates the use of statins to prevent cardiovascular disease. She was also the lead for the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) study and the Heart Protection Study 2 (HPS2) Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (THRIVE) study. She demonstrated that statins are also safe for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Armitage was Chief Investigator for the ASCEND aspirin trial, which studied cardiovascular disease in 15,480 patients with diabetes. ASCEND was the largest ever study that had every been performed to investigate whether aspirin should be used to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. The trial found that whilst aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by 12%, it increases the risk of major bleeding. As an addition to the ASCEND study, Armitage was supported by Alzheimer's Research UK to study the impact of aspirin and fish oil on memory and cognition in patients with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. They also studied whether aspirin changes the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. She also investigated whether fish oil and vitamin D supplements reduced cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, but found they had no impact.

The extensive marshes, swamps, and other wetlands of the area are important habitats for fish, waterfowl, and floodplain plants. The park is administratively in the Hlobyne, Orzhytsia, and Semenivka districts of Poltava Oblast, and Chornobai District of Cherkasy Oblast. Topography The park was formed in 2010 by combining a series of protected areas, each of which retains its original form. These include: * National landmark \\"Sulinsky\\", a spawning and wintering place for fish in the wetlands on the edge of the reservoir. * Hydrological reserve \\"Velikoselytsky\\" , a complex of shallow lakes, floodplain marshes, and swamps * Hydrological reserve \\"Plekhovsky\\", a meadow and marsh area with wild elk, fox, Beech marten, and boar. * Hydrological reserve \\"Salty\\", an area with saline soil and halophyte plants. * Hydrological reserve \\"Rogozov's corner\\", an area of lakes, elevated bogs, and swamps. * Reserve \\"Onyshkivsky\\", a landscape reserve. * Heritage site \\"Tarasenkovsky\\", a cultural park and also an entomologic reserve. * Hydrological reserve \\"Chutovsky\\", also a reserve of local cultural value. These areas are spread along the Sula River, it lower tributaries, and the approaches to the Kremenchuk Reservoir. Much of the terrain is flat, particularly around Sulsky Bay which opens into the reservoir; other areas of the right bank are hilly. In the bay, some islands reach 2‚Äì6 meters above water level. Boat landing on Sula River Climate and ecoregion The climate of Lower Sula is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over . Lower Sula is located at the western edge of the East European forest steppe ecoregion, a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. Flora and fauna The park is in a botanical zone of terraced meadow steppes, terraced oak-pine forests, flood plains (of the Sula River and tributaries), eutrophic marshes and meadow-halophytic vegetation (heavily influenced by the creation of the reservoir in 1959). Large areas of the reservoir are shallow, and aquatic vegetation has become highly developed. Because the ecology of the area is relatively new, it has not yet been fully studied. It is believed that over 600 species of vascular plants are within the borders of the park. Public use A new ecological tour path was open in 2017, with visits to representative habitats of the park, and informational signs along the way. The park supports educational programs for local school children. Much of the park is set aside for nature protection, but recreational use is permitted in designated areas, and swimming, recreational fishing, and water tours are popular. There have been problems in the past with illegal fishing, poaching, and non-permitted private use. Security measures have increased in recent years; during a crackdown on illegal fishing in 2012, park officials removed 12.8 kilometers of prohibited nets from the park's waters.

It marks her 37th work of poetry and has been described as \\"intensely personal, emotional and elegiac, and markedly different from Duffy‚Äôs other works\\" by the British Council. Rapture was first published in 2005 in the UK by Picador, and in 2013 in the US, by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. Rapture received the 2005 T.S. Eliot Prize. Synopsis Rapture follows the narrator through a love story. It begins with falling in love. ‚Äú Uninvited, the thought of you stayed too late in my head, so I went to bed, dreaming you hard, hard, woke with your name, like tears, soft, salt, on my lips, the sound of its bright syllables, like a charm, like a spell.‚Äù Later on, the tone of the book shifts from head over heels in love to brokenhearted.\\" The garden tenses, lies face down, bereaved, has wept its leaves.The Latin names of plants blur like belief. I walk on ice, it grimaces, then breaks. All my mistakes are frozen in the tight lock of my face. Bare trees hold out their arms, beseech, entreat, cannot forget. The clouds sag with the burden of their weight. The wind screams at the house, bitter, betrayed. The sky is flayed, the moon a fingernail, bitten and frayed.\\"  Themes  The main themes of Rapture are love, loss, loneliness, gender issues, and death.  Reception  Critical reception for Rapture has been positive. In a review for The Guardian Margaret Reynolds praised Duffy's lyrical voice and her attention to repetition and wordplay, stating \\"Reading about an affair is not supposed to have the same effect. But it does in the case of Carol Ann Duffy's Rapture.\\" In his review for The New York Times William Logan focused on Duffy's language, comparing her work to Auden and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Rumpus also praised Duffy's writing and wrote that \\"In Rapture, surprises land like a lover‚Äôs touch and scribble on your skin, right off the page\\". = Awards = * T.S.

The movie was produced by Pasidg Productions Inc. and distributed by Uncork'd Entertainment. Room for Rent was released on February 23, 2019, at the Sedona International Film Festival in Sedona, Arizona. The film concerns an aging widow who rents a room in her house in order to make some money. Things take a deadly turn when she becomes strangely obsessed with one of her new tenants. Plot Joyce Smith (Shaye), an elderly housewife in Sedona, Arizona, has lost her husband, Fred, in a slip and fall accident that occurred while he was fixing the roof. Her probate attorney finds that he owed a substantial amount of money on a loan, and, apart from $2,200 in savings, he left no other assets in his name. While checking out a romance novel in the library, Joyce notices a periodical that teaches homeowners how to turn their properties into a bnb (bed and breakfast), a term she's more familiar with). Joyce converts her property into a bnb and invites Sarah, a writer, and her boyfriend Edward to become her lodgers. She bonds with Sarah, but Edward is put off by her cozy demeanor, and the young couple promptly leave. Joyce longs for a relationship with a respectable man like the one pictured in her romance novel. A group of boys grope her, but another adult appears, and her attackers flee, leaving Joyce distraught and shaken. Soon after, Robert aka Bob (Ray√≥n) moves into the same room that Joyce's previous lodgers occupied, but her domineering nature makes him cautious. She becomes infatuated with Robert, making special dishes, buying satellite TV so Robert can watch football, and dressing to impress him. When Robert isn't around, Joyce rummages through Robert's stuff using his deodorant and toothbrush. Joyce and Sarah stay in contact through letters in which Joyce hints to Sarah of her obsession with Robert. The boys who harassed Joyce egg her house. Robert punches the leader and tells the boys not to come back. His defense of her makes Joyce's obsession with Robert even stronger. After breaking up with Edward, Sarah visits Joyce and shares an intimate night with Robert, which prompts Joyce to spill orange juice over the breakfast table. Joyce confronts Sarah, causing a rift between Sarah and herself. An ailing neighbour, Gladys, tells Sarah that she fell out with Joyce a long time ago due to her scary abandonment issues and split-thinking. Gladys also tells Sarah that Fred forced Joyce to abort a baby. After Sarah leaves, Joyce visits Gladys and suffocates her with a pillow. When Robert asks where Sarah went, Joyce lies, claiming that she returned to her husband and that Robert made her feel worthless. Robert catches Joyce going through his belongings and confronts her for her actions. Joyce lies to Robert, saying she acts strangely because she misses her son who passed away many years ago and whose bedroom Robert now occupies. Robert accepts the lie but remains concerned about Joyce's behavior, although he has a home-cooked meal with her. She spikes his digestif with a prescription hypnotic and sexually assaults him while he is unconscious. After the assault, Joyce rummages through his personal belongings where she finds cocaine and a large sum of money in a storage chest, suggesting he is a drug trafficker. After awakening, Robert receives a certified letter from Sarah, revealing Joyce's lies and manipulations. Robert confronts Joyce and collects his belongings, intending to move out, but Joyce bludgeons him with a frying pan, killing him. She reads Sarah's letter to Robert, in which Sarah reveals that she is pregnant. Joyce, who has always wanted a child, invites Sarah to stay at her home and continue to write her book in peace while Joyce takes a vacation using Robert's drug money. Joyce buries Roberts's remains in the backyard and gets rid of his personal items. She tells Sarah that Robert suddenly left after reading her letter. Joyce goes on vacation leaving Sarah to keep after the house. Sarah goes to Robert's old room but finds it locked. Unbeknownst to Sarah, Joyce redesigned the room into a nursery, leaving behind a welcoming sign from grandma, foreboding her return after Sarah has given birth.

Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"essential viewing for Lin Shaye fans\\" and wrote: \\"The supporting characters are not nearly as well-developed or interesting, feeling more like plot devices and reducing the film's overall impact. And director Stovall (Aaron's Blood), although certainly competent, doesn't infuse the proceedings with the sort of cinematic stylishness that would have elevated Room for Rent above B-movie status. Nonetheless, it's essential viewing for Lin Shaye fans, and that's more than enough.\\" Maria Lattila writing for the \\"Film Inquiry\\" told about the film: \\"Room For Rent is a lovely little thriller gem, a real diamond in the rough. It's not a class A film or cinema at it's purest, but it explores some fascinating themes and one of Lin Shaye's best performances. Alex Saveliev from the online publication Film Threat gave the movie 7 out of 10 stars and stated: \\"Tommy Stoval's unpretentious descent into madness has a mercifully short running time.

The screenplay was co-written by Martucci and Buricchi, based on a story by Luciana Anna Spacca. Buricchi began promoting the fact that famed Italian horror director Lucio Fulci had handled the special effects, or that Fulci had even co-directed the film. Fulci claimed he never worked on the film, and director Gianni Martucci even said that Fulci was way too ill at the time to have worked on the project with him. The film was later released to home video however with credits that still claimed that Lucio Fulci had collaborated on the film. Plot Ramona Curtis marries Robert Garlini, and they move into Robert's ancestral mansion. Rather than spending time with his new bride, Robert vanishes for long periods of time into the creepy basement of the house, and Ramona begins wondering why he suddenly lost interest in being with her. She soon uncovers a dreadful family curse.

Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. * Ludovico Della Jojo * Claudio Pacifico * Luca Intoppa Production Prior to directing The Red Monks, director Gianni Martucci had a sporadic career in film, working on only 5 films between 1972 and 1988. His work predominantly followed the trends of Italian films, such as scripting the giallo film Naked Girl Killed in the Park, erotic films, crime films and slasher films such as Trhauma. His final film was The Red Monks, in which he attempted to revive the gothic film genre in Italy. The film was aimed at foreign markets which led to its producer Pino Buricchi putting director Lucio Fulci's name in the credits initially as special effects supervisor. According to the film's script girl Anamaria Liguori, Fulci never once stepped on the set and had nothing to do with the film's special effects. Martucci commented on this, saying that Fulci had never set foot on set, but had agreed to lend his name to the film with the credit Lucio Fulci Presents, as the distributors desired a bigger name with which to market the film overseas. Shooting took place on location at Villa Giovanelli-Fogaccia in Rome. Martucci said there was some difficulty filming there as Prince Giovanelli would often wake up when they were filming and would get mad at the crew. Martucci did find the villa appropriate as Giovanelli only lived in one wing of the castle and it had a distinct fortress-like look, and the parts of the castle that were not lived in were nearly in a state of neglect which suited the film. Other locations used while filming included Forte Portuense. During post-production on the film, Martucci was told the running time was too short for distribution, which led to him re- editing the film to include a wrap-around framing segment. Release The Red Monks was distributed theatrically in Italy by Chance Film on 24 August 1989. It was quickly released on VHS in Italy through the Playtime label with text stating \\"Un film di Lucio Fulci\\" (). Fulci threatened to sue which led to a sticker being added to each video sleeve's cover that properly credited Martucci as the director. As late as in 2015, sources still stated that Fulci contributed to the making of the film.

Plot Julia \\"Turtle\\" Alveston, age fourteen, lives in California with her sociopathic father, Martin. He is convinced of impending catastrophe, forcing her to learn survivalist skills. Turtle is thus highly proficient with firearms. The extent of Martin's physical and sexual abuse of Turtle is revealed as the plot progresses, though Turtle's Stockholm syndrome cause her to make excuses for his behavior. Although Turtle's teacher suspects the abuse, Turtle is threatened with death by Martin if she tells anyone the truth. Turtle meets two teenage boys; they become her first real friends. After Turtle's grandfather, her only other living family, dies, Martin disappears for several months, leaving Turtle to provide for herself. When he returns, he brings a young girl named Cayenne, age nine or ten, whom he took at a gas station. One night, Turtle rebuffs her father's attempted rape by cleaning and loading her gun as he enters her bedroom. The following night she hears him bring Cayenne back to his bedroom instead. Using her shotgun, she blows the lock off his bedroom door, attempting to stop the rape. In the ensuing struggle, Martin nearly strangles her, though she is able to fight him off and escape with Cayenne; she flees to her friend Jacob's house, frightened because her father has the address and might hurt him in retribution. Martin arrives at Jacob's house. In an ensuing firefight where Turtle is shot three times, she manages to kill him, protecting her friends and Cayenne. She then lives with her former teacher, and uses gardening as a means to overcome her trauma. Reception Michael Schaub of NPR called the book \\"difficult to read\\" in reference to its depictions of child abuse. However, he also stated \\"it's also nearly impossible to put down\\", praising its thrilling pace. Schaub also praised the character Turtle, saying she was both memorable and original.

Col. Jean Bikomagu, ex-President Jean- Baptiste Bagaza, and former interior minister Fran√ßois Ngeze. The coup attempt resulted in assassination of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye, and numerous other casualties. Earlier in 1993, Ndadaye was elected in the 1 June presidential election and was sworn in on 10 July. Following the coup, the Committee of Public Salvation (CSP) was created as the ruling junta, and Fran√ßois Ngeze (a prominent Hutu member of UPRONA) was installed as the new President. Faced with widespread condemnation, the Army leaders urged civilian politicians to resume control. Consequently, Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi (who took refuge in the French embassy with other senior government figures) was installed as Acting President on 27 October. In November 2018 the Burundian government arrested four retired army officers, General Celestin Ndayisaba, Colonel Gabriel Gunungu, Colonel Laurent Niyonkuru, and Colonel Anicet Nahigombeye, with the intent to charge them with the murder of Ndadaye.  Background  President Melchior Ndadaye, pictured in 1993 After years of military dictatorship, Burundi transitioned to democratic rule in 1993 and hosted democratic elections. Melchior Ndadaye was elected President of Burundi in the 1 June presidential election and was sworn in on 10 July. On 19 October, an army officer approached the wife of Minister of Communications Jean‚ÄêMarie Ngendahayo and informed her that personnel in the army headquarters were plotting against the president. At 15:00 on 20 October, Major Isa√Øe Nibizi, commander of the 2nd Commando Battalion, commandant of Camp Muha, and the officer responsible for presidential security informed Ndadaye's chief of the cabinet about suspicious military movements. Later that afternoon, Ndadaye hosted a cabinet meeting in Bujumbura to mark the first 100 days of his presidency (which had passed two days prior) and discuss what his government had accomplished in comparison to its campaign promises. After the meeting, Ngendahayo requested to speak in private with Ndadaye. In the president's office, Ngendahayo raised concerns about Ndadaye's safety. Instead of informing the president about the vague threat his wife had learned of, he told him that he felt it strange that the Union pour le Progr√®s National (Uprona), the Tutsi-dominated opposition party, was denouncing the government's popular policy of allowing thousands of Burundian refugees to return to the country before the commune elections in December. Ngendahayo stated that he thought this would cost Uprona the elections, and thus the only reason they would oppose the policy is if they planned to take power via assassination and a coup. He also requested that Ndadaye further consider a previous report declaring his security to be inadequate. Ndadaye instructed Ngendahayo to bring him the Minister of Defence, Colonel Charles Ntakije. Ngendahayo found Ntakije in a separate room on a telephone call. Ambassador Melchior Ntamobwa, who was also present, told Ngendahayo that the colonel was being informed a coup plot meant to move forward that night. Once Ntakije finished the call, he and Ngendahayo went to the president's office. Ntakije told Ndadaye that a coup was being planned by the 11th Armoured Car Battalion, which was going to attack the Presidential Palace at 02:00 on 21 October. When asked how he would respond, Ntakije said he would gather trusted officers and organise an ambush if the battalion left its camp. Ndadaye inquired about the status of Sylvestre Ningaba, a former army colonel who had been arrested in July for attempting a coup, and asked if he could be relocated to a different prison so the putschists could not obtain his help. Ntakije said that this would not be possible due to the objections of prison officials to transferring detainees at nighttime, but he assured the president that he would station an additional armoured car at the Presidential Palace for extra security. Ndadaye spoke about training possibilities for the Presidential Guard before dismissing both ministers and going to the palace. When he arrived he told his wife, Laurence, about the coup plot, but was mostly assured by what Ntakije had said to him. Ndadaye and his wife went to sleep, but he was awoken by a phone call from Brussels by J. Alfred Ndoricimpa, the Methodist Bishop of Burundi, who informed the president of rumours circulating among the Burundian expatriates in Brussels of an impending military coup.  The coup  = Attack on the Presidential Palace = At around midnight on 20 October, putschists of the 11th Armoured Car Battalion departed from Camp Muha in over a dozen armoured cars and took up positions around Bujumbura. Within an hour they surrounded the Presidential Palace. They were joined by hundreds of soldiers and gendarmes from the other eleven military camps in Bujumbura, including members of the 1st Parachute Battalion and a few personnel from the 2nd Commando Battalion. They prepared to attack the palace, which was only guarded by 38 soldiers of the Presidential Guard and two armoured cars. Shortly before 01:00 on 21 October, Ntakije called the president and told him that armoured cars had left Camp Muha for an unknown destination and advised him to leave the palace immediately. Ndadaye then attempted to reach Captain Mushwabure, the commander of the palace guard, by phone, but when he did not answer he went into the palace gardens. At 01:30 the putschists fired a single shot, and shortly thereafter at least one armoured car blasted a hole in the wall of the grounds and began bombarding the palace with cannon fire. Laurence Ndadaye took her three children into an interior room and sheltered them under tables, though she and her son were grazed by shrapnel. Meanwhile, the president was disguised in a military uniform by his guards and placed in one of their armoured cars in the garden, where he remained for the next six hours. According to political scientist Ren√© Lemarchand, the palace guards offered sustained resistance to the attack until several of them defected to the increasing number of putschists and the rest gave up. Two of the putschists were reportedly wounded by gunfire when they attempted to enter the palace grounds. In contrast, Laurence Ndadaye stated that none of the guards resisted the attack. Laurence Ndadaye was unable to reach her husband's cell phone and believed he was dead. When Ntakije called for him, she told him that he was in the garden. Laurence then made a series of phone calls to Minister of Foreign Affairs Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Minister of Agriculture Cyprien Ntaryamira, Frodebu leaders, the provincial governors, and President Juv√©nal Habyarimana of Rwanda to inform them of the coup. After being warned, Ntibantunganya began calling Frodebu leaders in an attempt to rally the government. At 02:10 he reached Ngendahayo. Ngendahayo then telephoned Ntakije, who reported that the situation was under control. When Ntakije called back 30 minutes later, the colonel said that he was hiding and urged Ngendahayo to flee. Ngendahayo then took his family in his private car to the home of Michel Ramboux, a Belgian development official and personal friend. = Escape attempts of the government ministers = Meanwhile, the charg√© d'affaires of the United States embassy, Paul Patin, awoke to the sound of gunfire. He called his embassy's head of security and asked him to for a ride to the legation. When the officer and a United States marine arrived some Burundian soldiers attempted to impede their entry, but they soon departed and Patin reached the embassy, where he telephoned the United States Department of State and told them about the coup. At 2:45 Ntibantunganya telephoned Patin, telling him that the president was safe and that \\"the situation seems to be under control.\\" He also extracted Patin's assurances that the United States government would condemn the coup. At about 03:30 he told Patin that he was preparing to flee. Distrustful of his military guard, he changed into his gardener's clothes and walked to a friend's home, where he remained in hiding for the next two days. Ntaryamira hid in his neighbours' home, who were Tustis. When soldiers did not find him in his own residence, they went there asking for his whereabouts. The matriarch of the household told the soldiers that Ntaryamira had fled down the road, and they quickly departed. Meanwhile, the wives of Ntibantunganya and Ntaryamira, agreeing that they should split up from their husbands, sought safety in the home of their friend, Dominique Barumpozako. Soldiers went there in search of them and killed Ntibantunganya's wife and her houseguest, whom they mistook for Ntaryamira's wife. Minister of Home Affairs and Communal Development Juv√©nal Ndayikeza called the provincial governors before telephoning Patin to ask him for refuge in the United States embassy. Patin assured him safety, but before Ndayikeza could reach the embassy he was captured by soldiers and killed. Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Gilles Bimazubute was collected by soldiers from his residence. Though a Tusti, he was a proponent of majority rule and was thus regarded as a traitor by the putschists, who soon killed him. When soldiers arrived at Director of Intelligence Richard Ndikumwami's house, he drew a pistol to defend himself. They quickly disarmed him and bayoneted him in front of his family before taking his body away. Speaker of the National Assembly Pontien Karibwami lived in the former home of President Pierre Buyoya, which was constructed with many security features. The guards at his home did not resist the putschists, but they were unable to break in for an hour until they breached the reinforced doors with a bazooka. They fatally beat and bayoneted Karibwami and took him away. Deputy Prime Ministers Bernard Ciza and Melchior Ntahobama were betrayed by their guards and were imprisoned. However, a few hours later a junior military officer freed them and asked them where they wished to go. Ciza was taken to the French embassy, while Ntahobama was taken to the home of the deputy chief of mission of the Belgian embassy. At about 04:00, a technician awakened by the putschists was, after some delay, able to sever telecommunications between Bujumbura and elsewhere. With the phone lines inoperative, Patin decided to search for President Ndadaye. Upon reaching the Burundian Army headquarters, French military attaches who were present dissuaded them from going to Camp Muha, saying it was too dangerous. Shortly before dawn, Ngendahayo scaled the wall at Ramboux's residence and went to the neighbouring home, which belonged to his brother and was also where Minister of Refugee Repatriation L√©onard Nyangoma was staying. At about 07:00 Ngendahayo telephoned Army Chief of Staff Colonel Jean Bikomagu. The colonel stated that the situation was \\"under control\\" and that Ndadye was \\"in a safe place.\\" Ngendahayo requested a military escort so that he could go to the radio and television station and, as Minister of Communications, inform the country of such. Bikomagu said he would call back and send an escort when possible. = Death of Ndadaye = At about 7:00, soldiers breached the Presidential Palace and found Laurence Ndadaye and her children. They told them to go outside to find shelter in an armoured car. After 30 minutes of avoiding gunfire, they reached one of the two cars, which would not start. They quickly reunited with President Ndadaye, who was in the other armoured vehicle. The family considered scaling the perimeter wall to go to the neighbouring Meridian Hotel, but found that the palace was surrounded by putschists. At Captain Mushwabure's direction, Ndadye decided to be taken with his family to Camp Muha. At 7:30 they left in their armoured car, and were trailed by the putschists' vehicles. Upon arriving at the base at 8:00, their car was surrounded by putschists of the 1st Battalion. Ndadaye was taken by Colonel Bikomagu to a meeting with other senior officers of the army. About an hour later he returned with Secretary of State for Security Colonel Lazare Gakoryo, having reached a verbal agreement with the officers. Ndadaye reentered the armoured car with Gakoryo to finalise their understanding on paper, but when the secretary of state exited the vehicle soldiers began shouting for the president to come out. Once he did, Bikomagu quieted the crowd and Ndadaye appealed to the soldiers to negotiate peacefully with him. Soldiers began closing in on the president, and Bikomagu instructed them to let his family go since they were \\"of no interest\\" to them. He directed a driver to take the family away, and at Laurence's direction, the soldier brought them to the French embassy, where they were allowed to take refuge. Bikomagu then pointed at President Ndadaye and said to the putschists, \\"He is the one you were looking for. Here he is. Do what you want with him.\\" They placed Ndadaye in a jeep and drove him to the 1st Parachute Battalion's camp nearby, closely followed by Bikomagu, Gakoryo, and Major Nibizi. The president was taken to an office where ten junior officers‚Äîspecifically assigned to the task‚Äîkilled him. A coroner's report later found that Ndadaye was held by a cord around his neck while the soldiers bayoneted him 14 times. Half of the wounds penetrated his thorax and the subsequent bleeding filled up his lungs, killing him. The soldiers then dug a mass grave in the centre of the camp, where they buried Ndadaye, Karibwami, Bimazubute, Ndayikeza, and Ndikumwami. After several hours the soldiers realised that international opinion would strongly disapprove of such treatment of the bodies, so they exhumed them and allowed family members to collect them. Meanwhile at about 7:30 Ngendahayo called Bikomagu. Bikomagu stated that he was with Ndadaye, but that the president could not speak due to the presence of hostile soldiers outside and quickly hung up. Ngendahayo, his brother, and Nyangoma suspected that Bikomagu was lying and, feeling that he might have sent troops to kill them, they fled to the warehouse of Belgian businessman Michel Carlier. Carlier hid them in the warehouse, and Ngendahayo managed to reach Ndadaye's chef de cabinet via cell phone. He told them that the president was dead and that Ngendahayo, as Minister of Communications, had to inform the public. Afterwards, two technicians from the radio station phoned him, saying that while they could not broadcast a speech through their own station, they had a working telephone connection with Radio Rwanda. Ngendahayo proceeded to deliver the following message for Radio Rwanda: The message was repeatedly broadcast over Radio Rwanda throughout the day in French and Kirundi. Ngendahayo, his brother, and Nyangoma then took one of Carlier's company cars and reached the French embassy. Minister of Health Jean Minani was in Kigali at the time of the takeover, and confirmed to the international media the death of the president, saying on Radio Rwanda, \\"The dictators killed Ndadaye\\". He called for international armed intervention to protect the civilian government.  Analyses  The deaths of Ndadaye, Karibwami, and Bimazubute eliminated the constitutionally-delineated presidential line of succession. Political scientist Filip Reyntjens described the coup as \\"the most successful failed military take-over\\" in African history. Journalists Zdenek ƒåervenka and Colin Legum stated that \\"In military terms, the coup was a success. The predominantly Tutsi army still [held] effective power. However, in political terms, the actions by the military extremists was an abysmal failure since it failed in their major objective of displacing the democratically elected government.\\" References  Works cited    Coup Burundi Category:Military coups in Burundi Category:October 1993 events in Africa Category:1990s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts Category:Attempted coups d'√©tat ","title":"1993 Burundian coup d'√©tat attempt"},{"id":"61077694","text":"A sangucher√≠a, in Peruvian cuisine, is a kind of restaurant specializing in sandwiches (popularly known in Peruvian Spanish as s√°nguches) juice, sodas, and occasionally alcoholic beverages. Peruvians customarily relate these establishments to the night life, as a way to satisfy one's hunger after a night on the town. Types of s√°nguches =Butifarra= butifarra sandwich at the Bar Cordano. Among the many types of sandwiches one finds the traditional butifarra, made normally from pork loin cooked in a traditional Lime√±a manner called locally jam√≥n del pa√≠s, accompanied with fresh lettuce, salsa criolla, and occasionally a touch of mustard. This sandwich arose from the culinary exchange between Spain and the Viceroyalty of Peru. Later it was popularized in the fondas and bars of the immigrant Italian community, such as the Bar Cordano and the Bodega Carbone in the historic city center of Lima; Juanito in the Barranco District; La Lucha Sangucher√≠a Criolla in Miraflores; the Antigua Taberna Queirolo in Pueblo Libre; and others. =Other s√°nguches= Some types of s√°nguches, and other items of fast food such as salchipapa, in a local of Cajamarca. Besides butifarras, in a sangucher√≠a one might find a variety of other sandwiches: * S√°nguche de lech√≥n (grilled pork) * S√°nguche de pavo asado (grilled turkey) * S√°nguche de pollo (chicken) * S√°nguche de asado (strips of veal cooked in its own juices) * S√°nguche de jam√≥n del norte ‚Äî jam√≥n del norte being similar to jam√≥n del pa√≠s, but not colored with achiote, and often with a sweeter taste * Lomito ahumado, an embutido (cured sausage) similar to jam√≥n del norte * Triple (avocado, tomato, egg, and mayonnaise) All these sandwiches are typically served on crusty rolls, principally the French roll (pan franc√©s). They may be served with French fries or boliyucas (fried yuca balls), and with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, guacamole, or spicy sauces such as aj√≠ or rocoto.

It took him five years of working odd jobs in Seattle before he met the Dutch painter, Fokko Tadama, who took him on as a student and was able to gain him admission to a local art school. After graduating, he briefly returned to Japan to marry his childhood sweetheart. In 1917, they moved to New York, where he joined the Art Students League. While there, he made contact with his fellow Japanese emigrant painters, Kuniyoshi Yasuo and Ishigaki Eitar≈ç, who had also studied in Seattle. His primary instructor was John French Sloan, who had a profound influence on his style. His best known early paintings are light hearted scenes from the streets of New York. He won an award at a major painting and sculpture exhibition in 1921, but the prize was rescinded because he was not an American citizen. In 1924, he and his wife moved to France, where he exhibited at the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne. Later, he was awarded a prize at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants for his portrayal of soldiers and monks in Toledo, Spain. He returned to Japan in 1927, settled in Tokyo, and became a founding member of the . He became a staunch supporter of the Japanese military forces and, during the Pacific War, he created a series of propagandistic battle paintings, apparently done from photographs. During the last days of the war, he and his family were evacuated to their ancestral home in Tochigi Prefecture. He died in December of that year, shortly after learning that his eldest son, Ikuo, had been killed in June.  Sources  * \\"Shimizu Toshi\\".

Biography  Helmut was born on January 11, 1940 in the lower Austrian city of St. Valentin. Not much is known about his early life or his parents or siblings. He studied at a teaching academy in Vienna and worked at primary and special schools in Vienna and Tyrol. He also worked as a truck driver and projectionist. In 1969, he founded Wespennest, a literary magazine, with Peter Henisch. Starting in 1973, Zenker became a freelance writer and participated in author readings, including at the left- wing festival, Volksstimmfest, located in the Prater.  Writing  Zenker's grave Zenker began his writing career in 1974 with a series of books about the Viennese police major Adolf Kottan, but it was not published. He turned the book into a radio drama which was produced in 1975 by the SWF. Helmut saw great success in 1976. His first play, \\"Insanely Happy\\" was directed by Gustav Manker and premiered at the Vienna Volkstheater starring Karlheinz Hackl and included Rudolf Jusits. Major Kottan saw his screen debut in a 90-minutes television film at ORF. It was directed by Peter Patzak who also staged all other Kottan episodes. The series produced from 1976 to 1983 Kottan gained particular popularity with Lukas Resetarits in the lead role. In 1990, Zenker founded CABAL Buchmacher in which only books by Helmut Zenker were published. From 1990 to 1998, the successful TV series Tohuwabohu, written by Zenker, was produced starring Jazz Gitti, Franz Suhrada and Ossy Kolmann. In 2010, a new Kottan Investigates movie called \\"Rien ne va Plus\\" and was reminiscent of James Bond. The script was written by Helmut's son, Jan, and the film was directed by Peter Patzek.

It was published in 2008 by Bloodaxe Books, and won the T. S. Eliot Prize for poetry. Book title The book is named after its inaugural poem, \\"Nigh-No- Place\\". The poem itself is prefaced with an excerpt from Shakespeare's \\"Tempest\\", act 2, scene 2: \\"I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; and i with my long nails will dig thee pignuts...\\" The poem uses non-traditional titles and place names to draw the reader into its literary world. Style and content The collection features a variety of styles and formats, including uses blank verse, free verse, prose, and several metrical patterns. Onomatopoeia is used throughout, as well as alliteration and fine sensory detail. She also sprinkles her text with Scottish words and phrases such as \\"trow\\" and \\"stumba\\" (\\"dense mist or fog\\"). She divides the book into three sections of related poems. The first section, \\"The Mandolin of May\\", deals with the wilderness of Canada and man's fear of and dependence upon it. The second portion, \\"Nigh-No-Place\\", describes the culture, folklore, traditions, and landscapes of Shetland Islands, Scotland. The final section, \\"Seven Burra Poems\\", is inspired specifically by Burra, the collective name of two islands (East Burra and West Burra) it the Shetland archipelago. Themes and literary devices The settings of this book are the wilderness of northwestern Canada (in the Mandolin of May), the Shetland Islands, Scotland (Nigh-No-Place) and Burra, Shetland (Seven Burra Poems). It features several narrative poems that alternate between the first- and third person perspective as well as free-form verses and in a stream of consciousness style. She occasionally devotes entire pages to the clarification of a word or theme, sometimes a single word or sound is the theme. She often makes her point using animals' calls, cries, and grunts in repeating structures, with literary critic Stephen Knight noting her \\"use [of] white space, at one point evoking a silence into which a bird calls.\\" Animals are the main focus of much of the material and she spends a great deal of time detailing them extensively and examining their behavior without resorting to simple anthropomorphization. One example of this is the poem \\"Paternoster\\", which is a recitation of The Lord's Prayer, but from the perspective of a draft horse. This could be an illustration of bathos or blasphemy, depending on the inclination of the reader. Nevertheless, she attempts to record the connection between man and nature without justifying or condemning it. Some poems are somber, reflective pieces and others are light hearted celebrations of the flora and fauna of her environment. Awards Nigh-No-Place won the TS Eliot Prize for poetry in 2008 when Hadfield was 30, making her the youngest female winner of the prize and the youngest overall until Ocean Vuong won in 2017 at the age of 29. Andrew Motion, then the British poet laureate and chair of the judges panel (Motion, Lavinia Greenlaw, and Tobias Hill), said \\"Nigh-No-Place shows that she [Hadfield] is a remarkably original poet near the beginning of what is obviously going to be a distinguished career\\".

The book was reprinted in 2015, with an introduction from poet and novelist Helen Dunmore, and a revision that gave it 16 more pages and a new cover.  Themes and subject matter  The Drowned Book is a collection of poems based around Dante's Inferno, but the author decided to re-write them themed around a darker than usual form of water that is unclean and filled with emotions, and its part in the Northern English history. According to Sarah Crown, the author refers to the Victorian era and how the human's visioned themselves as being in control of the water element using different tools. In the poem \\"Re-edify me\\" he holds this thought in high regard. Yet, in \\"Water Gardens\\" poem, he talks about how detrimental the era was.  Critical response  Sarah Crown, reviewing the collection for The Guardian, called it a \\"lyrical and evocative collection\\". According to Tim Love, The Drowned Book sold 768 before being awarded with the T. S. Eliot Prize. Awards The Drowned Book was awarded both the T. S. Eliot Prize and Forward Prizes for Poetry in 2007.

Opened in 1926, the park operated for 40 years before closing in 1966. It received public attention for at least 2 deaths that occurred on the premises during its operations, which led to urban legends regarding the park being haunted.. There were a total of 6 deaths. History The land on which the amusement park was built was the site of a massacre over a land dispute in the mid-1700s between the Clay and Draper families. According to writer Rosemary Ellen Guiley, this event has been historically verified. In 1926, an entrepreneur named C.T. Snidow purchased the land and began developing an amusement park for the people of Mercer County, West Virginia. The park, which featured a ferris wheel and a swing ride, was popular among locals in the county, particularly families of coal miners who resided in the area. It also featured a swimming pool, race track, concession stands, dance hall, and cabins for overnight stays. In the early-1950s, a young girl on the swing ride was killed when a truck delivering sodas accidentally backed into the ride, striking her. A boy aged nine also drowned in the swimming pool, upon being left at the park by his mother, unattended, and was subsequently sucked down into the drain by his arm. The pool was filled in to prevent further accidents. The park was formally closed in 1966. In 1985, Gaylord White, a former employee who had worked at the park, purchased the land with plans to reopen it, and briefly reopened it in the summer of 1987. However, the park closed after a 1988 archeological dig uncovered numerous Native American artifacts, as well as human remains on the property that had been buried prior to the arrival of Anglo-European settlers. A total of thirteen skeletons were uncovered, mostly of young children. White briefly reopened the park, but it was closed after three years. Since its closure, the park has hosted guided paranormal tours. In the media =Television= Due to these local legends, the park was featured on the television series Scariest Places on Earth in 2002 where aired on ABC Family. The abandoned Lake Shawnee Amusement Park was also showcased on the part 5 episode of Most Terrifying Places in America which aired on the Travel Channel in 2010.

Dumo culture =Agriculture= Sago is the main staple food, where the clan owns individual palms. Within the clan trees are allocated to individual families, if it was planted by an ancestor. Sago takes an average of 40 years to grow so a man plants the sago for his grandchildren. A man's status is measured by the number of plants he plants for his descendants. Food gardens are a joint responsibility where men clear the larger trees, and women clear the undergrowth. Although decision making was supposedly made by the men, the women had covert decision making power behind the scenes over many gardening decisions. Most of the planting is mostly done by the women, who collect seeds from other women, although men too can collect and plant a garden. Traditionally pigs were raised by the women although traditionally owned by the men. =Economy= The Dumo culture has its own currency called the Deh and Hu-o. The Deh has the form of green jade beads stored on a string, in which they have an base 8 counting system for payments. One could give one Deh to someone who provides a fish or sago meal. If my brother gives a lot of fish, and I get a basket of sago too, I would recompense with 8 Deh. There is a lot of superstition about how the Deh came about. For example, there is a legend that Deh fell as seeds from a tree that fell into Lake Sentani, in West Papua, and changed into Jade Beads. There are also other legends about how they came about. The most recent findings is that they were made in Asia, somewhere in Borneo, Brunei, Pakistan, or India. They are not just normal beads, local people are very discriminating as to which are the genuine article. Different types of Deh have different prices ‚Äì so that green ones have a value of about 5 Kina, the blue have greater value. The light blue are very rare, dark blue is the most expensive. Brown, white, and transparent, varieties have intermediate value. The dark blue Deh has a value of about 20 Kina. Ho-u is made of the same Green Jade, some are white or brown, or clear glass. It currently has a value of about 500K for one. Each Hu-o is circular with a diameter of about 4 inches (5-6 centimetres) and they are about ¬Ω an inch thick, with a central hole about 3-4 centimetres in diameter. Hu-o are used usually for brideprice and death ceremonies. For example, when some member of a clan dies. A woman and her male sons are the property of her brothers and the clan. At her death the Hu-o goes to her immediate clan brother, and 24 Deh are paid to other male clan members. To attend a celebratory feast, a woman must pay 24 Deh plus a minimum of 100 Kina, to the brothers and other male Clan members who have organized the feast. The Deh and Hu-o are believed to have come from somewhere in the west. They came with migration. Women wear a belt with beads set in a distinctive pattern that tells members where they come from, for example a Papua New Guinea woman may wear beads that inform others that she came from Skuo, just across the West Papuan Border. The Deh of poorer quality are used for decoration, where the pattern of decoration tells others which clan you are from. =Social structure= The female members of the clan are highly valued members of the community, who must have exogamous marriages into other clans in order to bring more Deh into the clan. A man with many sisters is considered to be lucky. There are four payments for each couple, the first is the engagement price which varies in value. A second payment is the bride price, that contains several payments; paying first for her head (to signify the work she does carrying a , here called the \\"\\" and breasts and her navel (or \\"\\", to signify extension of her husband‚Äôs clan through her children that she carries in the womb). The third payment is when she dies which is the payment for the eyes or \\" payment, for when she closes her eyes for the last time. The final payment is for each male child she produces, which is called the \\"\\", literally meaning \\"a human seedling\\". The male child is owned by her clan even though he belongs to her husband‚Äôs clan. A payment must be made to her clan for each of them when they die. Female children belong to her husband‚Äôs clan, and bride price is paid to her husband‚Äôs clan.Dorothy Tekwie (2016) \\"The Dumo Culture (accessed 10/12/2016) =Political structure= Dumo society had a chieftain (\\"Wateh\\") structure, associated with \\"big men\\" and \\"warriors\\". Warriors often acquire and obtain larger holdings. Decisions are traditionally made by the men in the \\"men's houses\\" or (spirit houses) which were the biggest built structures of the clan. Women lived in a \\"family house\\" with their children. Many of the houses were destroyed during the days of the German administration.. The German administration also established a \\"luluai\\" and \\"tultul\\" system which has now been restructured as a ward system of local government. =Spiritual life= The Dumo people believed traditionally in two worlds, one is the world of the living, the second is the world of the dead. The living have a duty to maintain peace with the spirits of the ancestors who have departed. If they performed acts that were not acceptable to the living it would also be unacceptable to the dead. The living would know through dreams or visions that the dead were unhappy. In such cases sickness of children was seen as the spirits were unhappy. The long illnesses and death of a child was often seen as a result of parental stubbornness, and the spirits as a result would need to be appeased. The Dumo believed that the spirits of the ancestors did not depart but remained in close proximity helping and keeping an eye upon the living. Dreams play a significant role in the Dumo culture in foretelling events that are about to happen or in providing a message from the spirits of the dead to the living prescribing specific actions. Some people were believed to be more accurate dreamers than others, and they are able to confront others with a pointed message that is necessary to restore the victim of others to health. Today about 80% of the coastal people of the Dumo culture would be Catholic. The first missionaries arrived in Vanimo district in 1939. Since 1939 each village has a community cemetery, wheres previously they would be interred near the family houses. Previously the number of Catholics was almost 100% but the number has declined due to the arrival of American Pentecostal and evangelical missionaries.

She mainly produced children's picture books and cartoon strips, but also created cartoon strips for adults and novels for young adults. She is recognised as \\"a staunch advocate of promoting Australian animals and surrounds in an era when the majority of children's books were imported from England\\". Her picture books appealed for their lively, bright illustrations and \\"irresistible\\", \\"infectious\\", stories (several in rhyme), which used line and words economically and effectively. She was successful in the Australian, American and British markets, and some of her novels were also translated into German and Japanese. Her best known works are Ambrose Kangaroo, Susan, Who Lives in Australia (also published as Katherine), and Hugh's Zoo, for which she won the Australian Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book in 1965.  Biography  MacIntyre was born in Sydney on 1 November 1916, the daughter of John Norman MacIntyre, owner of a station near Burketown, North Queensland, and his wife Laura Minnie (n√©e Rendall). She had one brother and one sister (playwright Peggy C. MacIntyre), and grew up in country New South Wales. Her grandfather Donald MacIntyre, of Dalgonally Station in north Queensland, was the cousin of Duncan McIntyre, an explorer. MacIntyre became deaf in her teenage years as a result of an accident. She attended first Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School, and then Bowral High School. She studied commercial art at East Sydney Technical College, and credited Thea Proctor for giving her encouragement and inspiration in her art. She worked as a graphic designer, starting at a printing company in Woolloomooloo, where her first job was to design display cards, and then at an advertising company, where she designed soap and cosmetics packaging. During World War II, MacIntyre worked as a fruit picker in the Women's Land Army. She married artist John Roy Eldershaw in about 1950; they had one daughter, and lived at Narrabeen, in Sydney's Northern Beaches area. When her marriage ended, MacIntyre took other jobs, including working in the display section of department store David Jones.  Career  = Ambrose Kangaroo = MacIntyre sketched ideas for toys and children's books while working on her assigned tasks at the advertising agency. She published her first book, Ambrose Kangaroo, in Sydney in 1941. She also sent it to Scribner's in the US, who published it the following year. A Canadian reviewer considered it outstanding, and US reviewers thought Ambrose was \\"delightfully droll\\", \\"just as amusing as Ferdinand the Bull\\". One US reviewer wrote, \\"Never did kangaroos look like [this]. But we would not have it otherwise for Ambrose in his blue trousers and wearing a suggestion of a yellow hat between his enormous ears bids fair to captivate a very young audience.\\" Australian reviewers also liked Ambrose Kangaroo, finding it an \\"irresistible story\\", which \\"will entrance the small fry\\". Ambrose went into several Australian editions, and returned in further books in Ambrose kangaroo has a busy day (1944), Ambrose Kangaroo goes to town (1964), and Ambrose kangaroo delivers the goods (1978). From 1945, MacIntyre also drew an Ambrose Kangaroo comic strip for The Sunday Telegraph, Sydney, for about seven years, and created an Ambrose Kangaroo TV cartoon, which screened on ABC TV from 1958. = Cartoon strips = MacIntyre also created several other comic strips during the 1950s. One featured George, \\"a studious little boy who wanted to learn all about Australia\\", published in Melbourne; Annabelle, published in the Australian Women's Weekly, a \\"gay, irresponsible, exasperating, far-from- perfect secretary ... [who] you can't help liking\\"; and Mother, a weekly cartoon in another women's magazine, whose \\"hardships and experiences are mainly autobiographical\\", according to MacIntyre. = Informational picture books = Following the US publication of Ambrose in 1942, MacIntyre was asked by Scribners to write about Australia for an American audience, as many American servicemen were based in Australia, and their families wanted to learn about the country. Susan, Who Lives in Australia was published in the US in 1944, and subsequently published in Australia in 1946 under the title Katherine. The main character was a small girl who lived on a sheep station and had a holiday in Sydney. MacIntyre travelled to America in the early 1950s to meet with her publishers there, and to learn about the reading tastes of American children. Her success in the American market boosted her status in Australia. Two later revised editions of Katherine were published in Australia in 1958 and 1963, and all were warmly received, with reviewers in 1946 describing it as charming, while a 1958 reviewer called it \\"one of the most delightful Australian books issued for a long time. Lively, sunny drawings of pets, people and recognisable places and an agreeable rhyming text will make it a favourite\\". Muir's A history of Australian children's book illustration considered it \\"undoubtedly one of the most outstanding Australian childrens [sic] books of the immediate post-war period\\", while the biographical dictionary Twentieth-century children's writers described it as \\"a straightforward, amusing, uncomplicated description of a little girl \\"who lives in Australia/ With her toys and her pets and her paraphernalia\\" [which] has proved to have the most universal and lasting appeal\\" of MacIntyre's books. Other non-fiction works which followed Katherine were Willie's Woollies: The Story of Australian Wool (1951) and Jane Likes Pictures (1959). MacIntyre visited a sheep station near Coolac, New South Wales to make sketches for Willie's Woollies, in which she also showed processing in woollen mills and garment manufacturing. The illustrations and text had previously appeared in strip form in The Age newspaper's children's section; colour was added to the drawings for the book. Reviewers thought it excellent, \\"[i]nstructive as well as amusing ... [with] most expressive drawings\\"; \\"done gaily and simply with colored pictures and a minimum of words. .. combines fun with information\\". MacIntyre also produced a project sheet about wool for junior school students which was published by the Australian Wool Bureau in 1953. Jane Likes Pictures was inspired by MacIntyre's daughter's interest in art, and her friends who firstly found her odd, and then joined her in drawing. It was intended to introduce young children to drawing and painting, and reviewers considered it \\"delightful\\"; \\"a happy book that makes drawing fun\\"; \\"of immediate appeal ... an original and stimulating approach to art for the very young .. [with] a nice economy of words in the text and of line in the illustrations. The \\"tricks that are easy to do\\" ... will no doubt lead to some hilarious moments when the young try them out.\\" MacIntyre's training and experience in commercial art contributed greatly to her success as a children's illustrator. MacIntyre herself said, \\"Children's books have to be simplified, and simplified. ... The idea is to say what the picture doesn't convey, and vice versa. I had good training ... in an advertising agency. Often there was only two or three inches in which to convey all about a product and use an illustration.\\" = Fictional picture books = Mr. Koala Bear (1954) was another of MacIntyre's fictional picture books for young children, about an elderly koala who is unexpectedly visited by two young koalas, who believe he is their uncle. It was commended by the Children's Book Council of Australia in the 1955 awards, for \\"its humorous and pleasing illustrations.\\" One reviewer thought, \\"The pictures, bright and gay as the mischief they portray, are more fun than the rhymes.\\" Another wrote, \\"The jingles are so musical you almost want to sing them\\", and another suggested that the \\"delightful picture book in rhyme ... lends itself best to reading aloud.\\" A Times Literary Supplement reviewer found it \\"not quite at [her] best but still out of the ordinary. Elisabeth MacIntyre supports a thinnish story about Mr. Koala Bear with infectious rhyming couplets and her usual sparkling drawings\\". MacIntyre illustrated two children's books written by other authors, Three Cheers for Piggy Grunter by Noreen Shelley (1959), and The Story House by Ruth Fenner (1960), both published in Australia by Angus & Robertson. Both were entered into the Children's Book Council of Australia Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book, which was first awarded in 1956. Jane Likes Pictures was also entered in 1960, the same year as Three Cheers for Piggy Grunter. No awards for the picture book category were made in either 1960 or 1961. A report about the 1960 awards did not comment on the individual titles, but said, \\"the text should have literary value ... [which] is the main hurdle for entrants.\\" It was reported in 1961 that the judges found Fenner's stories \\"undistinguished\\", although the same report commented \\"The pictures are gay and will be patted, and otherwise enjoyed by young children. The end papers are the best piece of illustration.\\" = Picture books about conservation = MacIntyre wrote in 1978 that her books were \\"a sincere attempt to say something I really believe in. A straight book about Conservation might seem dull, but, as I see it, my Affable, Amiable Bulldozer Man sums up the whole subject painlessly.\\" Both Hugh's Zoo (1964) and The Affable, Amiable Bulldozer Man (1965) had messages about the conservation of Australian native flora and fauna. Hugh's Zoo tells of a boy who creates his own menagerie by catching birds and animals in the bush. A dog helps the creatures escape; Hugh is at first distraught, but comes to see that they are happier in their own environment, with others of their kind, and can still be enjoyed there. A Times Literary Supplement reviewer considered it \\"up to [MacIntyre's] usual high standard in being entertaining, factually based and thoroughly sensible\\". Hugh's Zoo won the Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book in 1965. The award was controversial; the judges' decision was not unanimous, and they were disappointed by the number of entries and the overall standard. However, they felt that Hugh's Zoo was \\"strongly and effectively presented with honesty and sincerity.\\" There was also much discussion by librarians in their professional journal. In The Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times, reviewers approved of the award, saying that it was \\"well deserved .... intelligent and highly entertaining\\", and noting that the \\"[v]ocabulary is not of the sieved-apple-and custard variety, but grown-up here and there; children of all ages lick their lips over new words.\\" In The Affable, Amiable Bulldozer Man, a bulldozer comes to clear bush, in the process destroying the homes of birds, animals and insects. One small ant bites the driver of the bulldozer, and the story has a happy ending. Kathleen Commins in The Sydney Morning Herald thought it was \\"sensitively told ... [with] some appreciative and gentle ridicule of the kind of places that would replace the forest.\\" A US reviewer, however, while recognising that destruction of forest and habitat occurred in the US as in Australia, found \\"the rhymes .. facile, the pictures amusing but ordinary.\\" Another Australian reviewer thought that the intended audience of young readers would invest the bulldozer with \\"the same magical significance as the steam engine or fire engine had for their parents.\\" = Novels for children and young adults = MacIntyre received a three year Children's Literature Fellowship from the Australia Council to visit the United States from 1974‚Äì1976, in order to study and write in the newly emerging genre of young adult literature. She also travelled to New Guinea, Italy and Japan, the latter with a grant from the Australia-Japan Foundation in 1976. MacIntyre said in 1978, \\"At first I wrote and illustrated picture books, using words sparingly. Now less interested in how things look, and more concerned in how they seem to be.\\" Ninji's Magic (1966) was MacIntyre's first full-length novel, for an older age-group than her previous books, and was also the first that she did not illustrate; the drawings were by Mamoru Funai. It was set in New Guinea, about a young boy from the highlands and his encounter with white people and western education. Reviewers described the story as \\"absorbing\\"; \\"informative, sympathetically told\\"; \\"an excellent picture of the old and the new in New Guinea\\". One reviewer thought that, \\"[a]lthough .. a sympathetic interpretation of a small boy's problems and aspirations, at times the theme seems contrived for a didactic purpose.\\" Another said, \\"a good story ... [its] primary importance is that through such stories young readers can come to understand certain common conflicts which exist in all cultures and that it is the lot of the young to know change [and] to adjust to it.\\" MacIntyre's other novels were The Purple Mouse (1975), It looks different when you get there (1978), and A wonderful way to learn the language (1982). The Purple Mouse features a girl called Hatty, who, like MacIntyre herself, is deaf. Reviews were mixed. School Library Journal wrote \\"This treatment of hearing impairment shows that, given enough clich√©s, any problem can be solved\\", and suggested other novels which offered \\"believable characters, credible plots, and honest representations of the implications of this handicap.\\" Another reviewer thought Hatty showed \\"a good deal of sensitivity and intelligence\\", and considered the book \\"particularly appropriate for adolescents who ... see themselves as misfits.\\" The main character of It looks different when you get there is a student who becomes pregnant, leaves university to have the baby, and moves around trying to find a place where she belongs. One reviewer thought that \\"though the ending is rather facile there are some well-observed glimpses of people and different life-styles.\\" Ninji's Magic and It looks different when you get there were translated into Japanese; Ninji's Magic was also translated into German. = Other work = MacIntyre also wrote radio serials and contributed articles about her travels, craft ideas, etc, to publications such as The Bulletin and the Australian Women's Weekly. MacIntyre had started drafting designs for toys before the publication of her first book. She made several attempts to sell her toys. In 1941, she held an exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney of wheeled toys, painted toys made of wood, felt and fluffy dusters, and painted nursery plaques and pictures. She made many toy animals, including Ambrose Kangaroo, and other Australian animals such as emu and platypus, non-native animals including a giraffe and horses, as well as soldiers and a street cart. In the late 1960s, MacIntyre made models of Australian fauna as ornaments, starting with plastic-coated wire covered with fabric, and then, recognising a need for \\"something to send overseas that was light, bright, and Australian\\", moulding them in plastic. She named them \\"Currency Lads\\", a play on the decimal currency introduced in Australia in 1966, as all six coins featured Australian fauna, and on the term Currency lads and lasses to refer to the first generations of people of British descent born in Australia. She did not have plans for marketing them, but said, \\"I feel I'm making a start and doing my best. If it makes someone say, 'I can do better,' and that someone does better, then it's worth while.\\"  Selected publications  * 1941 Ambrose Kangaroo (Australian Consolidated Press) * 1944 Susan, Who Lives in Australia (Scribner's, USA) * 1944 The Black Lamb (Jons Productions, Sydney) * 1946 Katherine (Australian version of Susan, The Australian Publishing Company; revised editions in 1958 (Angus & Robertson) and 1963) * 1951 Willie's Woollies (Georgian House, Melbourne) * 1954 Mr. Koala Bear (Scribner's, USA) * 1956 'Susan and the sheep stealing', a chapter in Round the year story book (ed.

Background Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams' daughter, Olympia, was born on September 1, 2017 in West Palm Beach, Florida. When Williams bought the doll for Olympia, she indicated that she wanted her daughter's first doll to be black because growing up, she did not have many opportunities to own a black doll. Qai Qai got her name from Williams's nephew. Social media presence Qai Qai's first post on her own Instagram was on August 22, 2018 where she is lying on the floor. She also joined Twitter that month, although the account has not been officially verified. Popularity and fandom has increased for Qai Qai. While likely run by Olympia's parents, Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian, it is unknown who administers the doll's account. Some images show Qai Qai being neglected. This spurred public concern where social media fans used the hashtag #QQPS (Qai Qai Protective Services). Qai Qai has been featured in several USA Today articles, Today and Oprah magazine, the last of which she did an exclusive interview. On August 29, 2019, Alexis Ohanian Sr. wore a shirt with Qai Qai's likeness to the 2019 US Open match with Serena Williams vs. Caty McNally. This same shirt was worn by Ohanian Sr. in an Instagram post on December 14, 2018. Another Qai Qai shirt was featured on Ohanian Sr.'s Instagram post. This selfie shirt was part of a limited run fundraiser for the non-profit organization Zoe‚Äôs Dolls, which was founded by an eleven year old with the mission of giving brown dolls away to brown kids.

It is operated by the Red Hook Initiative. Background Due to the location of Red Hook, Brooklyn, between the Red Hook Channel and the Buttermilk Channel, many of its residents face various challenges in accessing broadband service.. A survey found out that many people in the area accessed the internet primarily through mobile phones and that over 30% of the population did not have broadband access at home. First Red Hook WiFi mesh network node (Ubiquiti Nanostation) installation on the Red Hook Initiative rooftop Running (PoE) ethernet cable to install a mesh network node on the roof of apartment building north of Coffey Park Beginning in Fall 2011, the Red Hook Initiative (RHI), a Brooklyn non-profit, approached the Open Technology Institute about collaborating on a community wireless network. RHI wanted a way to communicate with the residents immediately around its community center. When the network was initially launched, it had support for up to 150 simultaneous users and ran on an open-software platform called Commotion. Repairing Red Hook WiFi mesh network node after Superstorm Sandy Hurricane Sandy In 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck the area, and many internet and communication systems were down throughout much of the city, Red Hook remained connected through its mesh network and the headquarters of the Red Hook Initiative became a hub for volunteer coordination, donation collections food distribution as residents came to the Red Hook Initiative's office to charge their devices and connect to the internet. Shortly afterwards, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) connected Red Hook Wi-Fi to its satellite system, linking itself, the residents and the Red Cross into a communication matrix that could be used to find out about emergency relief, food banks as well as shelter locations. After the relief efforts had finished, a team led by the Red Hook Initiative continued to make improvements to the mesh network by installing nano stations powered by solar panels on rooftops around the Red Hook neighborhood. Though the Red Hook Wi-Fi project was already in the works before Hurricane Sandy struck, it gained additional media attention after the storm. In 2015, Red Hook Wi-Fi was selected to be part of the city's resiliency initiative ‚Äî from a group of 27 finalists competing in the Resiliency Innovations for a Stronger Economy.

Biography  Reginald More Bray was the elder son and heir of Reginald Bray, JP, FSA, of Shere, Surrey, and of Frances Bray, n√©e Longman, of the publishing family. The Bray family was one of the oldest in England, being able to trace its descent from the time of the Conquest. The manor of Shere, whose lordship Bray inherited from his father, was first granted to Sir Reginald Bray by Henry VII and has been in the family ever since. Among his ancestors were Sir Thomas More, in whose honour he received his middle name, while his paternal grandmother was a sister of the political economist the Rev Thomas Malthus. A man with strong local connections, Bray was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Surrey in 1902. After attending Harrow School, Bray went up to Trinity College, Cambridge as a scholar, graduating as twelfth wrangler 1865.

In his last year at the bar, he won, in quick succession, three cases in the House of Lords after losing in the Court of Appeal, which was said to have played a role in his rapid promotion to the bench from the time he took silk. In 1904, on the resignation of Mr Justice Bruce, he was appointed a Justice of the High Court (King's Bench Division) on the recommendation of Lord Halsbury, and received the customary knighthood. Despite his late appointment, Bray was regarded as one of the ablest pusine judges. He frequently sat in divisional courts and as the third judge in the Court of Appeal. Having become ill in court, Bray died in Kensington, London, on 23 March 1923, and was buried at Shere.  Family  Bray married Emily Octavia Barclay, daughter of Arthur Kett Barclay, FRS, in 1888; they had four sons and four daughters.

For the false report, he was given a fine worth 4,5 million rubles. It was reported that he had been interviewed once for the case, but was too drunk to say anything. On November 28, 2014, near the village of Selets, Kulesh, while intoxicated, struck a 44-year-old saleswoman of a local store several times with an axe, taking the keys and, according to various sources, stealing between 5 and 8 million rubles, as well as alcoholic drinks, cigarettes, sausages and sweets worth another 8 million rubles. While leaving the store, he ran into the victim's son, who had already found the body of his mother in the woods thanks to a barking dog. Threatening him with a knife, Kulesh ran away and took a train to Baranavichy. The son of the murdered woman reported the criminal to the police, and Kulesh was detained on the train at Novoelnya Station.–í –°–µ–ª—å—Ü–µ —É–±–∏–ª–∏ 44-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω—é—é –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤—â–∏—Ü—É –º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω–∞–û–±–≤–∏–Ω—è–µ–º—ã–π –≤ —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ª–∏–¥—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤—â–∏—Ü: ¬´–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è —Ü–µ–ª—å –±—ã–ª–∞ –≤–æ–¥–∫–∞. –ü—Ä–æ –¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∏ —è –Ω–µ –¥—É–º–∞–ª¬ª–ö–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª. 10 —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –ø–æ –¥–µ–ª—É –æ–± —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ª–∏–¥—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤—â–∏—Ü–£–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤—â–∏—Ü –≤ –õ–∏–¥–µ. –ü–æ–¥—Å—É–¥–∏–º—ã–π –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª—Å—è –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –≤ —Å—É–¥–µ After the arrest, Kulesh began to cooperate and confessed to the double murder in the hope of replacing the death penalty with a life sentence: \\"I understood that I could not get away.

Relatives of the convict, who had previously barely participated in the trial, questioned Kulesh's participation in the first two murders. The lawyer focused the attention of the Supreme Court on the fact that the double murder in Lida was disclosed solely on the testimony of the defendant, since the police did not have fingerprints or the murder weapon. Another peculiarity was noted in the case: during the investigative experiment, Kulesh in detail presented the way to the southern region of Lida, where, according to him, he was on the day of the double murder for the first time after drinking 2 bottles of vodka and about 1 liter of beer, but did not remember whether the victims resisted.

She is the main protagonist of Bob Clark's seminal slasher film Black Christmas (1974) in which she was portrayed by actress Olivia Hussey. Hussey, known internationally at the time for her role as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet (1968), signed on to the role after a psychic told her that she would be involved in a profitable Canadian film. Despite the dark undertones of the film and the mature themes, Hussey has described shooting the film as a great experience. In early stages of the screenplay, she was named Jessica Bradley; this remained her name in the 1976 novelization of the film. She is sourced in numerous academic materials for subverting many prior horror film tropes of the 1960s and prior decades such as the damsel in distress. The character is distinctive for her feminist focused story arc which follows her decision to have an abortion despite the opposition of her estranged boyfriend. This was particularly notable at the time as it followed the 1973 landmark decision Roe v. Wade. This has led to her being a heavily discussed pop culture figure in film studies and the final girl theory. She is the first sole survivor of fictional slasher villain Billy although her fate is left ambiguous.  Appearances  =1974 film= In the original Black Christmas, Jess is a member of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sig. Jess, along with her sorority sisters, began to receive disturbing phone calls from a disorientated man. During a Christmas party, Jess receives another obscene phone call and lets Barb, Phyl, Clare, and several other girls to listen to the incoherent ramblings of the disturbed caller, who does several different voices within each call he makes. The next day, Jess meets with her boyfriend, Peter, to tell him that she is pregnant and getting an abortion which causes him to get upset. Jess later attends a search party to help find a missing girl. After the girl's corpse is found, Jess heads home and receives another phone call. She calls the police, unaware that Peter is in the house until he startles her and argues with her. He leaves as the police come and tap the phone. She manages to keep the caller on the phone long enough for the police to trace the call and they tell her the man is calling from inside the house. Jess calls for Phyl and Barb and grabs a fireplace poker and goes upstairs. She discovers the corpses of her friends and then sees the eyes of the caller who reveals himself as Billy looking at her through the door crack, telling her not to \\"tell what we did, Agnes...\\" before she slams the door on him. He then chases her downstairs and grabs her hair as she tries to unlock the front door. Jess manages to escape, fleeing to the basement with a fire poker for protection. She locks the door just as Billy starts to bang on the door in rage. As Jess wanders the basement, she sees Peter looking into the window, and Jess kills him, believing him to be the killer. The police then hear her screams. They sedate Jess and unknowingly leave her in the house with the real killer, Billy, who is in the attic. Her fate is left ambiguous. =1976 novelization= The character returns in the 1976 Lee Hays novelization although she is known as Jessica Bradley in this adaptation. The story retains the same plot as the film. Development =Casting= Hussey, who had previously garnered international fame for her role as Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), signed on to appear in the film after being told by a psychic that she would \\"make a film in Canada that would earn a great deal of money.\\" Approached by Clark to portray the lead role of Jess, Hussey agreed and left Los Angeles for eight weeks to film in Toronto, Canada in the winter of 1973. She described shooting the film as a positive experience despite the dark subject matter and stated that she worked well with Clark and two of the other leads, Keir Dullea and John Saxon. While admiring and respecting Margot Kidder as an actor, Hussey revealed that she was intimidated by her straightforward and serious demeanor that she had on set and that she often kept herself distant from Kidder due to their differing personalities and performing styles. =Design= As the Black Christmas films take place in a winter setting, the characters wear the apt attire. Jess begins the film in a black Christmas jumper that features two large, white hands stitched across the chest worn on top of a yellow collared undershirt and matching pants. Later in the film, she wears a black vest over a mustard collared shirt and darker pants.  Characteristics  In her original appearance, Jess was scripted as a timid yet strong willed young woman. Writer Shyla Fairfax describes Jess as being notably different to other heroines associated with the final girl theory due to her relationship with Peter (Keir Dullea) which contrasts with the sexual reluctance attributed to the trope. Fairfax also notes the feminist undertones the character exhibits through her decision to have an abortion despite the opposition of her boyfriend. Editor Peter Normanton describes Bradford as being the focus point of the film and her story arc having a major influence on the outcome of the film. Similarly, Alan-Bertaneisson Jones states that film focuses on Jess rather than the killer and describes her as being a \\"fully realized character\\" that is in the same ilk as Laurie Strode from Halloween (1978) and Sidney Prescott from Scream (1996) than victimized female slasher film victims. Television personality Richard Crouse praised Hussey's performance and describes Jess as being very multi layered. In an editorial for Bloody Disgusting, Meagan Navarro states that her imperfections and complexity make her feel more human like than a mere character.

Harding had arrived at King George Sound in 1846 on Dromo with his first wife, Elizabeth, and four young children. The family went back to England for two years between 1848 and 1850 for the children‚Äôs schooling. He returned to Fremantle in 1850, and by 1851 was appointed acting Harbour Master of Fremantle upon the resignation of Daniel Scott; the position was confirmed in 1852. In 1851 Harding‚Äôs youngest daughter, Emily Louisa died, followed in December 1852 by his wife. On 30 March 1853, Harding married for the second time, to Jane Harris; on the same day his eldest daughter Sarah Elizabeth, aged seventeen, married Charles Wittenoom, the fifth son of the Colonial Chaplain John Burdett Wittenoom. One son, Edward Horne, went on to be a prominent Australian politician; another, Francis Frederick Burdett, became a prominent pastoralist and explorer. Later the same year Harding's second daughter, Mary Rose, died in an accident whilst traveling to visit her older sister in Gwambygine. Jane died in December 1862 and in March the following year, Harding married Sarah Wickliffe, an Irish immigrant girl. In 1864, James Richard Harding, the last surviving child and only son of Harding was killed by Aborigines near Roebuck Bay. Harding did not know his son's fate until an expedition led by Maitland Brown returned to Fremantle with his body in May 1865. Harding acquired a number of properties in Norfolk, Suffolk and Adelaide Streets in Fremantle, and in 1866 purchased a land parcel north of Butler‚Äôs Swamp for ¬£20. On 23 June 1867 he drowned in the course of his duty, attempting to assist two ships, Ivy and Strathmore, in distress in Gage Roads. Harding‚Äôs body, identified only by his clothing, was not discovered until eight weeks later on Garden Island. Harding left all of his estate to his wife Sarah; however she was unable to cope with the grief of losing her husband and was committed to the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum. Her older sister, Maria, came over from Victoria and was appointed the executor of Sarah's estate. In 1891 Harding's land at Butler's Swamp was sold off and subdivided, becoming the suburb of Graylands.

Her work is informed both by participating in the contemporary resurgence of abstraction coming out of New York, and by living in the Post Colonial Pacific since 1992. She has participated in over thirty solo and over 100 group exhibitions in national and international venues. Debra Drexler is a Professor at the University of Hawaii, where she is Chair of the Drawing and Painting Area. She maintains studios in Brooklyn, NY and Kailua, HI. Work =Abstract painting= Debra Drexler's most recent work is highly experimental large-scale abstract painting. In a recent review of a two-person exhibition (Whitehot Magazine, 2017) Drexler's work as clearly referencing the long tradition of American abstraction and the established legacy of the New York School. The reviewer, Jonathan Goodman, described the work as a ‚Äúnew non- objectivity‚Äù that comes out of the current moment. He states that Drexler's painting ‚Äúquite accurately describes the spirit of abstract art today, in which painting is struggling to break free of the constraints of time.\\" She frequently uses hot pink, a color with heavily gendered associations. Her hot pink brushstrokes reference the ‚Äúheroic‚Äù marks associated with action painting, and feminize them. The luminosity and high key saturation in Drexler's work are created through multiple layers of glazing of pigment mixed with polymer and alkyd media. Some of her color choices reference the post- digital experience with its highly saturated synthetic color. The luminosity and saturation also mirror the unique quality of light and the over-the-top, tropical color interactions in Hawaii. =Gauguin‚Äôs Zombie= ‚ÄúGauguin‚Äôs Zombie‚Äù developed over seven years of research and art making between 1998 and 2005, and was exhibited at Honolulu Museum of Art (2002), Maui Arts and Cultural Center (2003) and Box-The Annex (2005). Based on the premise that Paul Gauguin, French painter and visitor to the South Pacific, has returned to life in a fictional exhibition in a fictional museum, this installation explores the complex dynamics between the past and present, the influence of colonialism and cultural identity, and the traditions of the Western and non- Western worlds. The installation included large-scale paintings, woodcarvings, a thatched hut, and fabricated writings such as emails, faxes, press releases, journal entries, and artist's statements. In The Transatlantic Zombie (Rutgers, 2015) Sarah Juliet Lauro, states \\"Drexler's reworkings of Gauguin's painting are a zombie project as well as a project representing the zombie: these are essentially the dead works of Gauguin made strange and given new life, but they definitively refashioned as a critique of Gauguin's work, and its, I would say starkly uncritical chronicle of empire.\\" In ‚ÄúDebra Drexler: Resuscitating Gauguin‚Äù in NY Arts Magazine (May/June 2005), Molly Kleiman states, ‚ÄúThe installation, an exercise in post-colonial appropriations and feminist inversions, is playful and subversive. She explores themes obliquely and cleverly, forcing no brittle lessons about the conflicts of post-colonial, no stubborn treatise on the poisonous male gaze. She doesn‚Äôt need to.‚Äù In Gauguin's Challenge: New Perspectives after Modernism edited by Norma Broude (Bloomsbury, 2018), Heather Waldroup writes, ‚ÄúThe themes of the exhibition are wide-ranging, including a critique of ethnographic museums and, in particular, their display of human remains; the commercialization of the museum through gift show sales; and the continued validity of modernism in contemporary art worlds (Drexler is, primarily an abstract painter).‚Äù =Shadow Play= Between 2007-2010, Drexler worked on a series in which the imagery became more abstract, leading her to her current body of abstraction. In a review of Shadow Play at HP Garcia Gallery, Michael Carter wrote in A Gathering of the Tribes Magazine (June 25, 2010), ‚Äù Like the most powerful abstract paintings of the last century, reproductions can only provide a crude chart of her stratagem; the luminosity of the oils themselves, along with their deft application can really only be truly appreciated in person. These are rare works, which show an artist struggling with and for the spirit.‚Äù Exhibitions and Recognition Some significant venues that have exhibited her work include Exit Art, NY (2010‚Äì11), White Box‚ÄìThe Annex (solo, 2005), Honolulu Museum, HI (solo, 2002), and The Schaefer International Gallery of Maui Arts and Cultural Center, HI (solo, 2003). Drexler's work was selected for ‚ÄúThe Intuitionist‚Äù at The Drawing Center (2014) which also featured the work of Kara Walker. In ‚ÄúFrom Here to There‚Äù at Art Finance Partners, NY, curated by Robert Edelman, the legacy of the New York School and its connection to contemporary painters was explored.

It was given the Kinderspiel des Jahres award in 1994. Although the game is designed for a maximum of 4 players, unofficial modifications were made by modders to maximise the game to 8 players. A Star Wars variation called \\"Loopin' Chewie\\" was produced by Hasbro in 2015. Gameplay =Assembly= The game requires assembly with a screwdriver putting together a central crane tower with a figure of the titular Louie in a biplane attached to the end of the crane. Up to four arms are connected to the tower, each with a canal, a barn, three chicken tokens and a lever (paddle). Finally for the motor to rotate the crane, two AA batteries are required. =Rules= The object of the game is for players to press their respective levers to keep Louie in the air to stop him from knocking the chicken tokens into the canals. Players need to time their lever presses carefully. If Louie hits a chicken token on the barn, it falls down the canal. The player that has at least one chicken token remaining is the winner.

Biography  Albert John Chalmers was born in Manchester on 28 March 1870. He received his qualifications in 1890 at University College, Liverpool, holding the Holt Fellowship. He joined the West African Medical Service, where he served for four years at the Gold Coast Colony, as the assistant colonial surgeon. He was the acting principal medical officer in the colony during the Siege of Kumassi in 1900 when he was mentioned in despatches and subsequently received the Ashanti Medal and clasp for his service. He left for Ceylon in 1901 where he worked for the next ten years as the registrar and lecturer on pathology at the Colombo Medical College. He was a captain in the Ceylon Volunteer Medical Corps and president of the Ceylon branch of the British Medical Association in 1907. In 1911 he was awarded the King George V Coronation Medal. After serving with the Pellagra Field Commission in 1913 he was appointed as the Director of the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories in Khartoum. By then he was a well known name in tropical medicine. While in Colombo he co-authored with Aldo Castellani the Manual of Tropical Medicine, the first edition of which appeared in 1910 and was described by F. H. Garrison as ‚Äúthe best modern book on tropical medicine‚Äù. In February 1920, Chalmers submitted his resignation to the Sudan Government and set out with his wife, Alice, on leave to travel around-the world but he fell ill in India. He died of acute infective jaundice in the General Hospital at Calcutta on 5 April 1920.

It was released on Steam for Windows and macOS on December 15, 2014. Early alpha and beta versions were browser-based and free-to-play. On October 14, 2018, the game was released for mobile iOS and Android platforms after a successful and long-supported Kickstarter fundraiser. Town of Salem is reportedly the largest online version of the classic social deduction party game Werewolf. It has a player base of over 8 million.  Gameplay  The game is inspired by the party games Werewolf and Mafia, in which players adopt different roles belonging to different teams, of an informed minority and uninformed majority, aiming to eliminate each other for control of the village or town. As the name implies, the game takes place in the historical town of Salem, Massachusetts, alluding to the infamous witch-hunt trials that killed innocent townspeople due to paranoia and superstition. The chief strategy of the game is to survive and accomplish win conditions. Players use a combination of role abilities, teamwork, communication, deduction and deception to achieve victory. The game features 49 unique roles, including ones from The Coven expansion pack. Seven game modes and one custom mode are available on the vanilla. The bespoke modes are Classic, Ranked Practice, Ranked, Rapid, All Any, Rainbow, Dracula's Palace, and Town Traitor. They are modes that have pre-selected roles for the match. Custom mode allows the host of the match to choose the roles available. All modes except Custom and Rapid require 15 players. Seven is the minimum number of players for Custom and Rapid modes. Once the match begins, the players will create their name for the match. If they did not type in a name, the game will automatically select a default name for them. Default names are based on the real-life figures of the Salem witch trials. After that, the game will designate each player a role according to an algorithm. In the vanilla game, there are three alignments: Town, Mafia and Neutral. Town and Mafia are two teams with their own win conditions. The win condition for Town is to \\"lynch every criminal and evildoer.\\" For Mafia it's to \\"kill anyone that will not submit to the Mafia.\\" Town players are uninformed, meaning they do not know the roles of other players. Mafia players are informed, meaning they know who other Mafia players are, but they do not know the roles of non-Mafia players. Using their role abilities and deduction, players discover the roles of other players to facilitate their victory. Town and Mafia can only win the game if the opposing team(s) perishes entirely. Neutrals have individual win conditions that must be achieved on their own. When a Neutral player dies without completing their win condition, they can no longer win the game even if another Neutral player completes their win condition. Some Neutral roles may survive and win with either Town or Mafia, as long as their win condition is completed. Neutral Killing roles, specifically, can only win when Town and Mafia are eliminated. The Witch is unique in that she can win with any roles so long as the Town loses and she herself does not die. A match goes through three main phases according to the time of day. Roles with nighttime abilities are active during the night. All murders are committed during the night; mafia can speak among themselves. When daytime arrives, the town will discover the bodies of townspeople who died the night before, their cause of death, their role, their will, and a death note. (It is also possible that nobody dies during the night.) Other actions that did not cause death (e.g. a Medium speaking with the dead, a Blackmailer silencing another player, a Doctor healing another player) are not announced by the game, but may be discussed by the players. An exception is the Amnesiac who can \\"remember\\" or assume the role of a dead player during the night. During the day, all townspeople gather to meet in a circle, facing a lynching stake at the center. Players enter a discussion phase via text communication in a chatbox. Players typically inform each other of what happened to them or other players during the night before, if they can. Since the game begins with a Town majority, the discussion will revolve around lynching potentially evil players. Though the central goal may ostensibly be eliminating the evil players, Mafia will attempt to deceive Town into lynching innocents (i.e. other Town players) and saving themselves. Neutrals typically deceive everyone since they are aligned to neither Town nor Mafia, though some may win with either team. Keeping a will is a prevalent metagame behavior, especially for Town players since they do not know each other's roles. The will does not bequeath anything despite its name. It is used as a form of testimony to prove a player's claims, typically a claim of their role. Players write information about what they know or did in their will, so that once they die or when asked to disclose information, other Town players can piece together information to identify the \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" townspeople. The will is automatically revealed after the player dies. Evil players usually keep fraudulent wills to deceive Town players into believing they're good. In Classic, Preparatory for classification and Ranked modes, where the roles are assigned for competitive purposes, role claiming is an important metagame strategy for Town players to eliminate possibilities. A list of available roles or role categories (e.g. Town Protective, Random Mafia, Neutral Killing) is included in every game, so by process of elimination Town players can figure out the roles of each player. This is not useful in Any mode, however, because in that mode the roles are randomized, not categorized, and simply named \\"Any\\" on the role list. After the discussion phase, townspeople can vote for a player to be placed on trial. They can vote for anyone but themselves. The vote to try must be a majority. Once a player is put on the stake, they have a moment to defend themselves, in which only they can speak. Then comes judgement phase in which the townspeople must decide to vote Guilty, Innocent or Abstain on lynching the player on trial. The vote to lynch must pass majority. Abstain votes are not counted. A tie will be considered an Innocent judgement. When a Guilty judgement passes, the player on trial will be lynched and the day immediately finishes, commencing the start of nighttime. This voting process may repeat as long as time allows, to a maximum of three trials per day. The day-and-night process repeats until one alignment survives and accomplishes their win condition, or if a Neutral Killing player eliminates all Town and Mafia players. It is important to note that multiple of the same Neutral Killing can win with each other, but different Neutral Killings must eliminate each other. The expansion pack The Coven introduced a new alignment, the Coven, which has a team win condition like that of Town and Mafia. It also added three exclusive game modes: Rivals, Lovers and VIP. Rivals has since been removed, however. There are Coven equivalents to vanilla game modes, except Rainbow, Dracula's Palace and Rapid.  Development  BlankMediaGames LLC was founded by Josh Brittain and Blake Burns on February 1, 2014 with a working staff of two programmers, two artists and one sound designer. Their mission was to bring a Werewolf and Mafia based online video game to the market. A Kickstarter campaign began on February 14, 2014 to develop Town of Salem. After thirty days, the fundraiser raised $17,190 surpassing its $15,000 goal. As development progressed with more donations, more features and mechanics were added. On September 13, 2014, the developers started a fundraiser for a Steam release, which would be its official release after alpha and beta versions. The fundraiser finished in 35 days, acquiring $114,197 from 7,506 backers. It surpassed its goal of $30,000. The Steam version was released on December 14. = Ports = On March 31, 2016, another Kickstarter fundraiser began after the release of a mobile beta version of the game. The beta was intended for tablet devices on iOS and Android platforms that will later be transported to mobile devices. The original project for a mobile port used Adobe AIR since the original game used Adobe Flash. Developers found the software laggy, so they rewrote the game from scratch in C++. The fundraiser intended to support further developments for a working mobile version. On September 28, 2018, two years after development, a launch trailer for the mobile game was released on YouTube. The game, now using a Unity base code, was released free-to-play on the Apple App Store and Google Play on October 14. It featured an extensive overhaul of the UI to one that was more ergonomic, had more and improved animations, and better graphics. On April 2, 2019 BlankMediaGames announced development of a Unity version of the web browser and Steam games due to the discontinuation of Adobe Flash Player in 2020. The opt-in beta version became available only on Steam on July 24. On October 28, 2019, the Steam Unity client was officially released. The formerly free-to-play Flash-based web version was still available for several months afterward. On May 28, 2020, the browser-based client was also updated to use the Unity engine. = Town of Salem ‚Äì The Card Game = On April 15, 2016, fundraising began for a card game version of Town of Salem. It raised $389,005 from 9,551 backers in 30 days, and had a pledged goal of $10,000. Unlike the video game in which the computer moderates and generates roles for each player, the card game requires a Moderator role, whose function is that of the video game's computer, like switching the day- night cycles and assigning each player a role. The card game gameplay is more akin to the original Mafia game, in which players close their eyes during nighttime and take turns using their abilities. = The Coven = On May 16, 2017, the expansion pack The Coven was announced. The expansion added one new faction, the Coven, and fifteen new roles. The original Witch role was replaced by the Coven Leader. Other Coven roles include the Hex Master, Poisoner, Potion Master, Medusa and Necromancer. The Town garnered four new roles: Crusader, Tracker, Trapper, and Psychic. The Mafia received two new roles: Ambusher and Hypnotist. The Neutral alignment category gained three new roles: Guardian Angel, Pirate, and Plaguebearer. Three new game modes were added: Coven VIP, Lover, and Rivals. Unlike the vanilla game, the expansion pack is not free-to-play. For players who paid for the Steam version of the game, the pack is half price. It was released through the Steam store on June 6. = Data breach = A data breach that affected over 7.6 million players of Town of Salem was disclosed in an email to security firm DeHashed on December 28, 2018. The breach involved a compromise of the servers and access to a database which included 7,633,234 unique email addresses. The database also contained IP addresses, passwords and payment information. Some users who paid for premium features also reportedly had their billing information and data breached. Investigative reporter Brian Krebs linked the hackers to Apophis Squad, a gang who made bomb threats against thousands of schools and launched distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Reception  In 2020, PC Gamer named Town of Salem one of the best free-to-play browser games. Innes McVey of Game Skinny rated the game seven out of ten stars, saying, \\"Town of Salem is a very good adaption of the Mafia and Werewolf party games, but sadly retains the issue from its inspiration(s)...\\" Matt Cox of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game \\"an online hidden role game with no friends or eyeballs, and a whole load of bullshit.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Category:2014 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Social deduction video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Salem witch trials in fiction Category:Strategy video games Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Massachusetts Category:Video games set in the 17th century Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows games Category:Video games about witchcraft Category:Alternate history ","title":"Town of Salem"},{"id":"61079315","text":"Gorgany Nature Reserve () is a strict nature reserve (a 'zapovednik') of Ukraine that covers a part of the Gorgany mountain range of the Outer Eastern Carpatians in southwest Ukraine. The reserve is 46% old-growth forest, one of the last and largest such stands in Europe. The reserve was originally created in 1996 to protect relic stands of Stone pine trees (Pinus cembra). The reserve is administratively in the Nadvirna District of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Topography The Gorgany range is mostly strongly-layered sedimentary rock (a type called flysch), that fractures into debris fields known locally as 'gorgan'. The full vertical range of the central Carpatians are represented, with altitudes in the park ranging from 710 to 1754 meters above sea level. The range runs from northwest to southeast, on Cretaceous and Quaternary conglomerates, sandstones, clay and marls. There are 30 mountain streams in the park, forming a dense network that feed into the Bystrytsia River. The steep landscape, formed in the Wurzburg glaciation, is covered with coniferous forests. Stamp of Ukraine (2009) commemorating Gorgany Nature Reserve Climate and ecoregion The climate of Gorgany is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over .. Average temperature in January is and in July is . Average annual precipitation is . Average annual humidity is 78%. Flora and fauna 76% of the territory is stable, natural forest that has grown on its own and demonstrates the sustainability of the site through the complete forest cycle. 46% of the total area is virgin (old-growth) forest, totalling over . The dominant trees in the old-growth stands are spruce and pine. The relic pines (European, ordinary, and mountain pine), decay to produce the soil that supports the more productive successor fir and beech forests. The lower elevations are mixed deciduous and coniferous. The most numerous non-tree plants are the herbaceous perennials, with relatively fewer shrubs (cranberries, heather, blueberries, etc.) The main altitude zones are: * Stream valley - mixed forest. * Moderate and cool zone (770-1200 meters asl) - spruce forest * Moderately cold thermal zone (1200-1600 meters asl) - pure fir and cedar-spruce forest * Sub-alpine zone (about 1600 meters asl) - pine shrubs, and rocks covered with moss and lichen Further down on the lower stream terraces are speckled alders (Alnus incana), with grass cover featuring white butterbur (Petasites albus), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), marsh horsetail (Equisetum palustre), marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris), and narrow-leaved bittercress (Cardamine impatiens). Forest landscape in Gorgany Scientists have mapped the reserve into 17 different characteristic forest types, the diversity due to altitude zoning, soil differences, micro-climate differences, and other factors that make the Gorgany Reserve a valuable reference for natural Carpathian ecosystems. Public use As a strict nature reserve, Gorgany's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is limited: mass recreation and construction of facilities is prohibited as are hunting and fishing.

Dimi Amora of the fourth century who often carried Palestinian doctrinal and exegetical remarks to the Babylonian schools, and Babylonian teachings to Palestine (see Abdima Na·∏•ota). In consequence of a decree of banishment issued by Constantius II against the teachers of Judaism in Palestine, he finally settled in Babylonia.Hullin 106a; Gr√§tz, \\"Gesch.\\" 2d ed., iv. 338; against Gr√§tz, however, see I. ha-Levi, \\"Dorot ha-Rishonim,\\" ii. 468-473 Dimi was a perfect storehouse of diversified knowledge, which he diligently gathered and as freely disseminated; and he made the transmission of the teachings of his most prominent Palestinian predecessors his special mission. He reported in the names of Jannai, Hanina, Joshua ben Levi, Shimon ben Lakish, Isaac, Eleazar, and, most frequently, R. Johanan; and almost as often he reported Palestinian observations with merely the introductory formula (\\"They say in the West\\").Shabbat 7a, 8b, 52a, 63b, 72a, 85b, 105a, 108b, 125b; Eruvin 3a; Yoma 55b; Ta'anit 10a; Hagigah 15b; Megillah 18a; Yerushalmi Nedarim 9 41b; Bava Kamma 114b; Bava Metziah 58b; Bava Batra 74b; Sanhedrin 7b, 56a, 63a; Menachot 26b; Temurah 12b, 14a; Arachin 16a Abaye was the most appreciative recipient of Dimi's information, which ranged along the lines of the halakhah and the aggadah, occasionally touching also physical geography, history, and ethics.Shabbat 108a; Ketuvot 17a, 111b; Berachot 44a; Kiddushin 31a; Avodah Zarah 36b; Bava Metziah 58b When Abaye once inquired of him, \\"What do the Westerners [Palestinians] most strenuously avoid in their social intercourse?\\" Dimi replied, \\"Putting a neighbor to shame; for R. ·∏§anina counts this sin among the three unpardonable ones\\".The other two being adultery and calling nicknames, Bava Metziah 58b Dimi was also opposed to the bestowal of excessive praise, and thus illustrated the Biblical proverb (Proverbs 27:14), \\"He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.\\" Usually Dimi communicated his knowledge personally; but where circumstances required it, he did so by messages. Thus, when on one occasion, having himself reported in Pumbedita a halakhah as construed by R. Johanan, he discovered on his arrival at Nehardea that he had been mistaken, he sent word to the misinformed, candidly confessing, \\"What I have told you is founded on an error\\".Shabbat 63b Dimi Babylonian scholar of the fourth century; brother of Rav Safra. According to the testimony of his contemporary, R. Abba, Dimi was not endowed with worldly goods,Ketuvot 85b but was blessed with a clear conscience. In his last hours he was visited by his learned brother, to whom he remarked, \\"May it come home to me (\\"I deserve God's mercy\\"Jastrow, \\"Dict.\\" p. 132a) because I have observed all the rules prescribed by the Rabbis\\". When asked, \\"Did you also refrain from sounding your neighbor's praises, for in continually talking of one's virtues, a man incidentally refers to his vices?\\" he replied, \\"I have never heard of such a precept; and had I heard it, I should have followed it.\\"Arachin 16a Another version makes Dimi himself the transmitter of that very rule.ib.; Bava Batra 164b; Sefer Mitzvot Gadol Prohibition 9; Dikdukei Soferim, in Bava Batra 164b Dimi of ·∏§aifa (Meg. 29b; compare \\"Sheiltot ·∏§anukkah,\\" end): See Avdimi of Haifa.

Dimi bar Joseph Babylonian scholar of the third amoraic generation (third century); disciple of Samuel of NehardeaKetuvot 60a; Niddah 66a and senior to Rav Chisda and Rav Sheshet.Bava Batra 53b His sister sued him before Rav Nachman for the restoration of a parcel of land which she had legally transferred to him in her illness. Probably because of Dimi's age and professional status, he refused to obey Nachman's summons until he was threatened with excommunication.ib. 151a When his son had the misfortune to lose a child within thirty days from its birth, and‚Äîcontrary to the rabbinic rule, which does not impose mourning for an infant under thirty days of age‚Äîhe had assumed ritualistic mourning, Dimi remonstrated with him, observing, \\"It is only because you desire to be regaled with delicacies that you indulge in ritualistic mourning for so young an infant\\".Shabbat 136a Dimi b. Levai Babylonian scholar of the fourth century. Once on a cloudy Friday, he thought that the sun had set, and at once recited the Sabbath prayer. Subsequently the skies cleared, and he discovered his mistake. Upon his seeking rabbinic guidance, Abaye declared that he could resume his weekday work.Berachot 27b Dimi of Nehardea Babylonian scholar of the fourth century; head of the Academy of Pumbedita (385-388). Prior to his elevation to the rectorate he was a produce-merchant; and the Talmud preserves an anecdote of that time which affords an insight into the economic laws of the age as well as an idea of Dimi's standing among the learned even in his youth. The law had provided that‚Äîexcept the dealer in spices or perfumes at any time, and the public generally while fairs were being held‚Äîno non-resident merchant might enter his wares in competition with local traders. A notable exception to this rule was the scholar. To him the market was always open; and to facilitate his sales and his return to study, the law gave him the rights of monopoly until he disposed of his goods. Now, Dimi once brought to Mahuza a shipload of dried figs, when Rava was requested by the exilarch \\"to tap Dimi's pitcher\\", i.e., to examine him ascertain whether he was a scholar and consequently entitled to the special market privileges. Rava deputed Adda bar Abba (Ahaba) to examine Dimi; and Adda propounded to the newcomer a supposititious ritual question. Dimi thought that his interlocutor was Rava himself, and deferentially inquired, \\"Is not my master Rava?\\" The other, familiarly tapping him on the sandal, replied, \\"Between me and Rava there is a great difference. At any rate, I am your superior, and Rava is your superior's superior.\\" The privileges of the market were not granted to Dimi, and eventually the figs spoiled. He then applied to Rav Yosef for redress; and the latter, provoked at the discomfiture of the scholar, exclaimed, \\"He who has not failed to avenge the disgrace of the Edomite kingsee II Kings 3:27; Amos 2:1 will not fail to avenge your disgrace.\\" It is added that shortly afterward Rab Adda died suddenly, and several rabbis, including Dimi, who had some grievances against him, reproached themselves with having been indirectly instrumental in his punishment.Bava Batra 22a As an educator Dimi acted on the maxim, \\"Rivalry among scholars advances scholarship\\"; therefore he approved Rava's rule not to remove a teacher because his rival makes better progress with his pupils, arguing that rivalry will induce more strenuous efforts and produce better results. On the other hand, Rava, believing that \\"mistakes will correct themselves,\\" showed preference for the teacher that succeeded in imparting much knowledge, even if not very exact. Dimi opposed this with his maxim, \\"Where error has once crept in, it stays\\"; and he therefore looked for precision rather than for quantity.Bava Batra 21a He is only cited in the TalmudBesides those quoted above, see Mo'ed Katan 12a; Yevamot 121a; Bava Batra 138b; Menachot 35a; Hullin 51b in connection with halakhah, while no aggadah appears in his name. Dimi b. Nehemiah (Nahman) b. Joseph A Babylonian amora of uncertain age, only rarely cited in rabbinical literature.Sanhedrin 23b, 24a He is probably identical with Avdimi b. Nehuniah, by whom the Psalmist's effusion,Psalms 139:14 \\"I will praise you; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are your works; and that my soul knows right well,\\" is illustrated thus: \\"Some things are beneficial to the liver and deleterious to the windpipe; others are beneficial to the latter and deleterious to the former. There are ten organs in man: the windpipe [larynx] produces voice; the gullet conducts the food; the liver is the seat of anger; the lungs promote thirst; the gall, jealousy; the stomach, sleep; the first stomach grinds the food; the spleen promotes laughter; the kidneys counsel; and the heart decides. Therefore David glorifies, 'I will praise you...\\" Therefore, too, he elsewherePsalms 103:1 exhorts, 'Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name'\\".Midrash Tehillim ad loc.; compare Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:19 References It has the following bibliography: * Gr√§tz, Gesch. 2d ed., iv., note 29; * Bacher, Ag.

Occupying the central position in the peristyle (sacred space at the centre of the hounfour / oufo), the potomitan takes the form of a decorated wooden post (occasionally a living tree) by means of which, it is believed, the loa descend to earth to inhabit, for a time, the bodies of the faithful through spirit possession. ] The structure consists usually of the whole trunk of a palm tree, being fixed to the ground by a masonry pedestal commonly known as a socle and attached at the top to the roof of the temple. A potomitan is often painted with designs in bright colours, featuring usually the motif of two intertwined serpents, symbolizing the primordial male and female divine couple Damballa and Ayida Weddo who, according to the cosmogony of the Haitian religion, support the sky, preventing it from crumbling and falling to earth. Taken its entirety, however, the ritual post represents the deity Papa Legba, the gatekeeper or messenger of the loa, without whose intercession communication with the realm of the divine would be impossible. Sacrifices are carried out regularly to sanctify the structure / honour the deity, either at the foot of the potomitan itself or at the base of the socle - most notably prior to voodoo ceremonies proper - in order to keep it a fit conduit for the transmission of the divine powers.Tann, M.C. 2012 Haitian Vodou: An Introduction to Haiti's Indigenous Spiritual Tradition.

In 2018, Ravell said that it was \\"a stretch\\" to suggest that the website provided hope with their humour, but that he hoped they could \\"bridge a gap with the censorship that's happening on TV and radio\\". Since 2014, the website has co- produced the comedic TV news show \\"Weekly Report\\", hosted by Jos√© Rafael Brice√±o, with VIVOplay. In 2013, Henrique Capriles denounced that an upper- level high school textbook on contemporary history included a satirical cover of newspaper El Nacional that was created by El Chig√ºire Bipolar, representing the Ch√°vez-led 1992 coup attempts. At least 26 people had developed the textbook, which was approved by the Education Minister, with 400,000 copies printed. In 2016, the BBC praised the website for exploiting national blackouts \\"for all of their comedic potential\\", compared to other newspapers and even the popular internet memes shared on social media in the country, including fake articles like reporting on how Venezuelans have developed night vision, sharing a humorous pseudo-government-proposed daily routine, and celebrating the blackouts for their reprieve from compulsory broadcasts (cadenas).

The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby & Pickering Railway at . Ingleby station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located south of Stockton, and only west of Battersby railway station. History The first stage of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway was opened between Picton and in March 1857. The line eastwards from Stokesley to Ingleby was opened in February 1858, though the station at Ingleby wasn't opened until 1861. From Ingleby, the extension of the line to , was opened in April 1858. The station was located north of Ingleby Greenhow and was furnished with three sidings in a goods yard on the eastbound platform. In 1859, two years before the station at Ingleby was opened, the North Eastern railway bought out the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway. The timetable from 1864, when the line only extended as far as railway station, saw the station served by four trains on a daily basis with an earlier train on Wednesday mornings towards Stockton labelled as a Market Train. This came back in the late afternoons and terminated at Castleton. There was also one extra market train service on a Saturday leaving Stockton at 16:30 for all stations to Castleton. Bradshaw's timetable of 1877 shows five out and back workings between Stockton railway station and Whitby, with connections advertised in Middlesbrough. A working North Eastern Railway document shows that the station had five passenger services each way throughout the week. The goods trains passing through were minerals, coal, the pick-up goods and a daily service of coke to the ironworks at Grosmont. The timetable of 1906 shows that the station had six services eastbound from Stockton railway station via , with five going all the way to and one terminating at Battersby railway station. Return services were just five a day with four coming from Whitby. The other service from Whitby reversed at Battersby and went to Stockton via railway station. By 1946, eight years before closure, the service was down to just three stopping services each way per day, with most of the services from Whitby to Stockton reversing at Battersby and going via Middlesbrough. The station was closed to passengers in 1954, along with most others on the line, however, Ingleby was also closed to freight on the same day, the first on the line to do so. When the line was lifted at the western end, the eastern portion from Battersby to Stokesley remained open for freight. This was finally closed in August 1965. The nearest railway station to Ingleby is railway station, which is located on the Esk Valley Line.

As a teenager, he was interested to join the 'Hindustan Socialist Republican Association' and later he joined and met Chandra Shekhar Azad and became a good comrade of Bhagat Singh.  Early life  Jaidev was born in 1908 on Diwali eve in Hardoi, Shahabad district, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Shaligram Kapoor, was a member of Arya Samaj. Jaidev learned wrestling under the tutelage of Chhote Maharaj and Thakur Ram Singh.  Revolutionary activities  While studying in D.A.V. College in Kanpur, he, along with Shiv Verma, joined Hindustan Republican Association formed by Shachindra Nath Sanyal. A few years later (1925‚Äì27), Jaidev was entrusted with the task of developing the revolutionary network in Banaras. Accordingly, he enrolled for the B.Sc course in the Hindu Banaras University. Bhagat Singh stayed in the Limbdy(Limbdi) hostel with him for several days. Jaidev was a participant in the now famous meeting of revolutionaries operating all over India which was held in the ruins of Feroz Shah Kotla on September 8‚Äì9, 1928. In this meeting, it was decided that Hindustan Socialist Republican Association would have two wings, one administrative and one military. Jaidev was part of the military wing. He received training in manufacturing bombs in Agra. Jaidev played an important role in the assembly bombing as a protest against the Trade Dispute Bill and the Public Safety Bill. He declared himself to be a student of economics studying at Delhi College and got permission to use the assembly library. He soon managed to form an acquaintance with a vigilance officer who helped him to get sanction letters for visiting the assembly. He used to take his associates for inspection of the assembly building. The famous hat-bearing photograph of Bhagat Singh was taken a few days prior to the assembly bombing. Jaidev had made the arrangements in the studios of Ramnath Photographers at Kashmiri Gate in Delhi. Kapoor, Shiv Verma and Rajguru had planned to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, when he would attend a dinner and banquet party hosted by the I.C.S officers. Rajguru was the spotter, Jaidev was supposed to hurl a bomb at Irwin's car and Shiv Verma was the backup: if Jaidev had missed, Shiv would throw another bomb. That night, the Viceroy sent his car to drop three women somewhere. Rajguru noticed this and he didn't give any signal but was later praised by all the revolutionaries for avoiding the indiscriminate assassinations. After the environment in Delhi heated up after the assembly bombings, the bomb factory was shifted to Saharanpur by Jaidev, Shiv and Gaya Prasad Katiyar and others. Their plan was to run the bomb factory in the guise of a dispensary. Shiv and Jaidev were the compounders. Kishori Lal, Sukhdev and others were also present. The lack of funds and the movements of these three soon made the locals and the police suspicious. Soon, Mathura Dutt Joshi, the Deputy Superintendent of Police ordered a raid on the factory and all were arrested. They were then sent to Lahore and tried under the infamous Lahore Conspiracy Case. He was sent to the Kala Pani. He expressed the desire to meet Bhagat Singh and other associates for last time. Bhagat Singh handed over his brand new shoes to Jaidev saying that the police would take them anyway, at least, Jaidev could use them. Jaidev preserved them as a souvenir. Jaidev was released after 16 years (just a couple of years before India attained independence).  Death  Jaidev died on September 19, 1994.

The hamlet is located at the southern end of Malhamdale where the nascent River Aire meets Otterburn Beck. The village is north west of Skipton and used to have a railway station on the line linking Skipton and Hellifield. Historical industries in the hamlet consisted of a cotton and a silk mill, with quarrying prevalent also. Tourism became the leading industry in the 20th century. History The name of Bell Busk is believed to have been derived from Old Norse and Old English meaning the bell shaped bush. Bell Busk is north of Coniston Cold, north west of Skipton, south of Malham and east of Hellifield. The hamlet sits at the southern end of Malhamdale, where the River Aire meets Otterburn Beck. Malhamdale is the very northern end of Airedale. Official records of the area make no mention of the hamlet until 1585, even then, it was not shown on mapping until the early 17th century. In 1781, a weir and large mill pond with a long mill race were constructed on the Aire to provide water power for a silk mill. The weir was located south of Malham and from the mouth of the Aire on the River Ouse. The mill has long since been demolished after it was destroyed by fire, but the weir was only removed in 2018 to make fish passage easier into the spawning grounds. This is to encourage salmon into the River Aire and its tributaries after a 200-year absence. In the 19th century, quarrying became an important industry when at least three rock quarries were in operation; Field Rock Quarry to the west, Esh Bottom Quarry to the south west and Haw Crag Quarry to the east. Haw Crag was noted for its medium-purity limestone which was used in the local buildings. Quarrying here was on quite a large scale compared to other quarries in the area; was processed in the month of January 1877 alone. Haw Crag Quarry is now an SSSI as it \\"key site in the understanding of carbonate environments in the Craven Basin.\\" Bell Busk used to be in the West Riding of Yorkshire, but since the county boundary changes of 1974, it is now in North Yorkshire. Metcalfe Models and Toys, a model kit firm that specialises in cardboard buildings used for dioramas and by model railway hobbyists, is based in Bell Busk. Bell Busk is located in the civil parish of Coniston Cold and is included in the statistics there for the 2011 census. Transport Originally, Bell Busk was on the packhorse route between Skipton and Settle, which meant the road veered off at Coniston Cold, whereas this now goes directly west towards Hellifield as the A65 road. The junction and road leading up to Bell Busk from Coniston Cold is narrow and can cause access problems. The hamlet had a railway station on the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway between and . As it was the nearest station to Malham Cove and Malhamdale, it took on a far greater importance than other settlements in the dale due to it being a disembarkation point for travellers. The station site was used as a backdrop to the Bette Davis film Another Man's Poison in 1951, but was closed to passengers in 1959. The long distance paths, The Airedale Way, the Trans-Dale Trail 2 and the Rail to Trail Walk (the Bentham Line) pass through the hamlet on their way north (to the source of the River Aire for the Airedale Way and Greta Bridge for the Trans-Dale Trail), and westwards respectively. Both the Pennine Way and the Wild Yorkshire Way, pass to the east of the Hamlet, with many cottages and other overnight accommodation being offered in Bell Busk.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History European settlers first arrived in Prairie Ronde Township in 1828. In 1837, William and Elizabeth Crose Fanckboner moved to Prairie Ronde from Warren County, New Jersey along with their five children, following Elizabeth's father and brother, who had settled nearby earlier in the 1830s. In 1838, the Fanckboners purchased the farmland where this house is now located. They likely constructed a small temporary house, then built what is now the front section of the existing farmhouse in about 1840. The Fanckboners lived and raised their children, including two born in Michigan, in this house for decades. The house itself was expanded twice during the nineteenth century. The Fanckboner's daughter Libbie eventually married a neighbor, Leroy Nichols, in 1875. After William and Elizabeth Fanckboner died (in 1881 and 1888), Libbie and Leroy Nichols bought out the other heirs to the farm and managed the acreage. Libbie died in 1905, but Leroy continued to live at the farm with his children. In the early 1900s, he had the present large barn built, along with a number of other outbuildings. Leroy Nichols married Emma Kellogg in 1912, and the couple lived on the farm until 1924. They then moved into Schoolcraft village and rented out the farm. In 1938, Leroy and Libbie's son Harold and his wife Lillian moved onto the farm. They farmed until the 1950s, then rented out acreage to other farmers. Harold and Lillian lived there until their deaths in 1989 and 2003. The farm was passed on to their children. Description The Fanckboner-Nichols Farmstead consists of approximately three acres, which contains a farmhouse, barn, Workshop/Woodshed, and grain bin, along with trees, a large yard, and a cistern. The farmhouse as originally built was a small Greek Revival I-house with a low second story. The exterior is clad with clapboarded with plain cornerboards, and a broad frieze with classical cornices with returns runs along the top. The front has a center entry flanked with square-head double-hung windows. On the front, two small horizontal \\"eyebrow\\" penetrate the frieze. Small double-hung windows are located in the gables. Nineteenth century additions of a gabled section and a lean-to have expanded the houses's footprint in the rear. Another bedroom wing was also added in the early 1900s. A Victorian, hipped roof front porch with turned columns was added in the early 1900s, replacing an original Greek Revival style porch. The workshop/woodshed, dating from the early 1900s, is located near the house. It is a long, narrow, gable-roof, one-story structure clad in horizontal wood siding. The barn, also dating from the early 1900s, is a rectangular, gambrel-roof building on a low concrete foundation clad in its original vertical boarding. The grain bin, dating from about 1950, is a cylindrical metal bin with a conical roof, located near the barn.

In her writing, Grainytƒó uses personal and collective memories, reflections on everyday life, and social themes which she expertly endows with poetic, absurdist and surrealist undertones. Equipped with the gaze of an ironic anthropologist, she brings out processes that often escape our notice, while her reserved skepticism lightly mocks the overly emphasized aspects of social life. In her writings, Grainytƒó pays a lot of attention to the sentence structure, the topicality, and the paradoxical quality of the imagery she constructs.

(2019) After its first description in 2019, the describers suggested the common name of Dungowan bush tomato, in reference to Dungowan Station where it was collected. The species is restricted to a small area in the central region of the Northern Territory of Australia on and around the Buchanan Highway. It confounded field botanists since at least the early 1970s because it does not conform to any one floral form and/or inflorescence type. Any given plant might consist of a fully andromonoecious inflorescence, a solitary bisexual flower, a solitary short-styled flower or an extended rachis of staminate flowers. It can therefore exhibit any of three breeding systems: andromonoecy, hermaphroditism or functional dioecy. The describers commented that Solanum plastisexum is \\"a new species that serves as an example of for the diversity of sexual/reproductive form that has been increasingly recognised amongst plants ‚Äì it is also evidence that attempts to recognise a ‚Äúnormative‚Äù sexual condition amongst the planet‚Äôs living creatures is problematic.

Background In 1976, Angela Mary Woolliscroft (1956‚Äì1976), who was born in SurreyBirth Registration Index, 1837‚Äì2006, England and Wales (General Register Office, Southport, England), 1956 Sep Surrey N. 5g 385- and lived in Chessington, was working as a teller at the Barclays Bank branch at Ham Parade, Upper Ham Road, Richmond when she was fatally wounded by a shotgun during a robbery; she died on the way to hospital. After a major police operation Michael Hart was arrested, put on trial, and in November 1977 sentenced to life imprisonment. Hart was released in 2002. Robbery On 10 November 1976 at 12:30pm Angela Woolliscroft was working as a cashier at the Barclays Bank at Ham, Richmond. A heavily disguised man threatened her with a sawn-off shotgun and told her to \\"Give me some money\\". She passed him some money under the screen. The man then fired the shotgun, destroying the safety glass screen and blowing her backwards. She died on the way to hospital. The gunman had made off with about ¬£2,500. The gunman had left behind a woman's yellow raincoat that had been used to hide the shotgun. The coat had belonged to a Miss Marshall, and it was her car that had been used for the robbery. Her Austin A40 had been taken from the car park of Bentalls in Kingston and then returned. Also found was a large pale orange plastic bag that had contained fertiliser that had been taken from Parkleys estate opposite the bank. Barclays Bank offered a reward of ¬£50,000 for information leading to the arrest of the gunman. Hunt The hunt for the killer was led by Detective Chief Superintendent James Sewell of Scotland Yard. Hart was interviewed after a tip-off but had an alibi; he had signed on at the police station in Basingstoke where he was on bail for other crimes in the morning and again in the afternoon. However on 22 November he was stopped after a traffic accident and police found a Hendal .22 automatic. A search of his house found a box of Eley No 7 trap shooting cartridges. Both the pistol and ammunition had been stolen in Reading on 4 November; also stolen was a double-barrelled Reilly shotgun. At first the ammunition appeared to not match that used to kill Angela, which had been gameshot. However they found that the ammunition had been incorrectly labelled. Trial Hart was arrested and charged with murder on 20 January 1977. Hart (aged 38) pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. He maintained that he cocked the gun only to frighten, and that it went off by accident when he tapped the glass screen. He was found guilty of murder on 3 November 1977 and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should serve at least twenty-five years. He was released in 2002. Memorials Plaque, now in the Richmond branch Angela Woolliscroft was buried at Surbiton cemetery on 29 March 1977. The funeral service was held at St Catherine of Siena Roman Catholic Church, Chessington, and was attended by members of the murder squad, the local MP, the deputy mayor of Kingston, members of staff from Barclays and pupils from Holy Cross convent, New Malden; the coffin was escorted by members of Barclays Bank international hockey team. Memorial seat A memorial plaque was placed inside the bank building at Ham with the wording \\"In fond memory of Angela Woolliscroft who died on 10th November 1976. A member of staff of this branch who will always be remembered by her colleagues.\\" The bank closed in 2014 and the plaque was moved to the branch in George Street, Richmond. There is also a memorial bench outside the former bank building in Ham (now a Sainsbury's store) and three more were placed round Ham Common.

The novel won the inaugural Howard Frank Mosher Book Prize in 2017, selected by Howard Frank Mosher himself shortly before his death in January 2017.  Setting  The novel is set in the real-life ghost town of St. Thomas, Nevada, in Clark County, approximately 60 miles northeast of Las Vegas. It was flooded in June 1938 by Lake Mead following construction of the Boulder Dam and remained underwater for 64 years. Due to ongoing drought, the ruins of the town permanently resurfaced in 2002. It is now located within Lake Mead National Recreation Area adjacent to Valley of Fire State Park.  Plot  In 1933, six-year-old \\"Little\\" Henry Lord lives in the village of St. Thomas, Nevada, with his mother, Ellen Lord, father, Thomas Lord, and paternal grandfather, Henry Lord, an auto mechanic. St. Thomas is to be flooded entirely by Lake Mead following construction of the Boulder (Hoover) Dam. The elder Henry believes that water will never reach his home, and refuses the government's attempts to buy his land. However, Thomas takes a job with Six Companies, the construction group building the Hoover Dam, to earn enough to buy his own home. Living and working in Boulder City, Thomas only visits St. Thomas every few weeks. On one visit, Thomas takes Little Henry into the crawl space below the family home. Here, he shows his son a safe where he keeps his valuables, and makes Little Henry promise to safeguard the contents should anything ever happen to him. On July 6, 1935, Thomas falls to his death at the dam. In the spring following Thomas's death, Henry buys a rowboat with an outboard motor. Fishing on the Muddy River becomes a favorite pastime. Water finally reaches St. Thomas in mid-1938. Henry finally decides to purchase a new home in Overton, Nevada, and he and Little Henry go out on the Muddy for one last boat ride. While boating, a violent thunderstorm begins, flooding their house. Little Henry realizes he cannot reach the safe; worse, his mother has vanished. Two days later, on June 11, 1938, Henry sets his house on fire and leaves St. Thomas with Little Henry in the rowboat. In Overton, Henry opens a new auto garage near his new home. His grandson continues to attend school and develops into a fine athlete, as well as an apt mechanic. Henry plans to give his business to his grandson, but Little Henry wishes to attend college in Montana. In August 1944, they plan a trip to Yellowstone National Park, and Henry promises to visit his grandson in Montana. However, the night before Little Henry's departure, his grandfather dies of a heart attack. It is now December 8, 2002. Little Henry is now a 76-year-old widower residing in Las Vegas. An article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal explains that drought has exposed the ruins of St. Thomas, underwater for six decades. Accompanying the story is a photo of the elevated concrete foundation of the Lord homestead. Little Henry sets off to find his father's safe. Unfortunately, the safe is impossible to open. In frustration, Little Henry strikes the safe with a crowbar, inadvertently digging a small hole in the silt and knocking over his bottle of water, which spills into the hole. In the hole he finds a white object, which appears to be a large shell. He begins to dig it out and uncovers his mother's gold necklace. He realizes that the white object is actually a part of her skeleton. During the storm, Ellen attempted to remove the contents of the safe herself, but was trapped under the house and drowned. Little Henry decides that he will return to St. Thomas to once again attempt to open the safe but determines that his mother's remains will stay in St. Thomas, along with the remains of many other family members. Characters * Henry Lord, an auto mechanic * Ellen Lord, his daughter-in-law * Thomas Lord, his son * \\"Little\\" Henry Lord, son of Ellen and Thomas, grandson of Henry, narrator * Mr. Whitmore, the postman * Charlie Snyder, Little Henry's friend in 2002 * Louis, the waiter at Sahara Saloon Background Ellis visited St. Thomas for the first time in 2012 and was intrigued by the remains of the Fenton Whitney home. Entering the crawl space beneath the elevated concrete foundation, he wondered what it would have been like for someone who left St. Thomas as a child to return more than 60 years later, and what they might have left behind as a child that could be retrieved after six decades underwater. Further inspiration was provided by the story of Hugh Lord. Lord refused to leave St. Thomas until June 11, 1938, when the water was high enough for him to step out his front door into his boat. Then he set fire to his house and watched it burn. He was the last resident of St. Thomas to leave. Reception Author Howard Frank Mosher, who selected the novel to be the inaugural winner of the book prize named in his honor, stated that \\"Lords of St. Thomas is both a terrific coming-of-age story and an exact and haunting evocation of a bygone time and place. What's more, it's a great read.\\" New England Review of Books called it \\"a thrilling story where readers measure how much they value their rights and how far they're willing to fight for them. Ellis does a compelling job of showing the Lord family's nearly noble hopelessness in their fight to change a fait accompli, without capitulating to sentimentality.\\" Midwest Book Review stated, \\"Lords of St. Thomas masterfully couples a historic event with a classic coming of age story...[offering] a glimpse into the past and a glimmer of hope for the future.\\" Pam Ferrell of the Historical Novel Society wrote, \\"Beautifully written, Lords of St. Thomas is the story of tragedies leading to subsequent tragedies [and] a thoughtful portrayal of the human consequences of major environmental changes,\\" while Margot Harrison of Seven Days called it \\"a sparsely eloquent, elegiac novel.\\"  References   External links  *Lords of St. Thomas at Goodreads *Lords of St. Thomas at jacksonellis.net Category:2018 American novels Category:American historical novels Category:Novels set in Nevada Category:Novels set in Las Vegas Category:Novels set in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Novels set in Wyoming Category:Novels set in Montana Category:2018 debut novels ","title":"Lords of St. Thomas"},{"id":"61080715","text":"The Emperor of Paris is a 2018 French historical drama film directed by Jean- Fran√ßois Richet and written by √âric Besnard and Richet.

Lesbians may also be ignored within the LGBT community and their identity may not be acknowledged. In history Journalist and author Victoria A. Brownworth wrote that the erasure of lesbian sexuality from historical records \\"is similar to the erasure of all autonomous female sexuality: women's sexual desire has always been viewed, discussed and portrayed within the construct and purview of the male gaze\\". Oftentimes, erasure of lesbians is enabled when LGBT organizations fail to recognize the contributions of lesbians, such as when, in 2018, a statement by the National Center for Lesbian Rights about the Stonewall riots did not acknowledge Storm√© DeLarverie's involvement in the uprising. In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko became the first openly-gay political candidate in the United States to win an election. However, this achievement in LGBT history was incorrectly ascribed to San Francisco politician Harvey Milk. In scholarship Political theory researcher Anna Marie Smith stated that lesbianism has been erased from the \\"official discourse\\" in Britain because lesbians are viewed as \\"responsible homosexuals\\" in a dichotomy between that and \\"dangerous gayness\\". As a result, lesbian sexual practices were not criminalized in Britain in ways similar to the criminalization of gay male sexual activities. Smith also points to the exclusion of women from AIDS research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smith believes that these erasures result from sexism and suggests that these issues should be addressed directly by lesbian activism. In advertising Marcie Bianco, of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University, said that lesbian erasure occurs in advertising. Advertisers do not target lesbians when they are publicizing products to LGBT audiences. As an example, she cited the collapse of AfterEllen, which she says resulted from a lack of advertisers. The former Editor in Chief of AfterEllen, Karman Kregloe, stated that advertisers do not think of lesbians as women, and Trish Bendix observed that lesbians are assumed to like anything gay, even if it is male-focused. Language and lesbian spaces Author and women's history scholar Bonnie J. Morris and many other lesbian activists, such as same-sex marriage groundbreaker Robin Tyler, Ashley Obinwanne, screenwriter and co- founder of the platform Lesbians Over Everything, and AfterEllen owner and Editor in Chief Memoree Joelle, say the amorphous term queer, when used to describe lesbians, is a \\"disidentification\\" term that contributes to lesbian invisibility.\\"Queer\\":  In an interview about her 2016 novel Beyond the Screen Door, author Julia Diana Robertson discovered that her self- identification as a lesbian and her description of the novel's genre was changed to queer and queerness in the published quotes. At the 2018 Brighton Pride parade, the only instance where the word lesbian appeared was on a banner celebrating Storm√© DeLarverie. Shannon Keating of BuzzFeed, pointing to significantly more people especially the younger generation having identities outside of the gender binary, says that \\"against the increasingly colorful backdrop of gender diversity, a binary label like 'gay' or 'lesbian' starts to feel somewhat stale and stodgy\\". Keating also says some queer-identified women feel more comfortable with queer than lesbian because of ideas about gender essentialism, there now being more LGBT diversity, and the possibility of internalized homophobia. Keating stated that \\"the word 'lesbian' has carried such a deeply uncool connotation for so long‚Äîsometimes for terrible reasons (ugly, old-fashioned, essentialist stereotypes) and sometimes for extremely legitimate ones (a history of transmisogyny)‚Äî[that] it's worth considering if making the term cool is something we should really want at all.\\" Several feminist lesbian activists have lamented the rapidly increasing disappearance of many physical spaces, such as lesbian bars, women's bookstores, and music festivals, that were alternative lesbian spaces in which lesbian subculture thrived. Alexis Clements of Curve magazine said that the explanation for why so many lesbian spaces have closed or changed is unclear, but that \\"part of it is definitely economic\\" and part of it \\"relates to political changes\\", saying that \\"as legislation gradually shifts to reduce LGBT discrimination around things like marriage or employment, it may be that many now feel more integrated into the larger culture and don't see as much need for separate space or political activism.\\" She also questioned if the change is generational, as \\"there's been a shift toward queer identities and politics that are born of a belief that gender and sexuality operate on a spectrum that doesn't necessarily fit into male/female or straight/gay/bi paradigms\\" while \\"others, still, prefer and believe in the need to create spaces that are more inclusive.\\" Keating said that some aspects of gay male culture have been represented in mainstream culture \\"in a way lesbianism simply hasn't\\" and that \\"gay male spaces, from bars to entire city neighborhoods, have managed to maintain some modern relevance, while lesbian bars and bookstores have shuttered en masse across the country\\", but also that lesbian bars \\"and spaces across the country have gone out of business for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with trans inclusion.\\" Keating said that there are still places and events for lesbians, but that they are often under \\"a different, broader, more inclusive name\\" and \\"that's not necessarily erasure: That's evolution.\\" Keating reasoned that \\"embracing gender diversity and welcoming queer people of all stripes have kept certain historically lesbian-only events and spaces alive, and allowed new ones to grow.\\" While Christina Cauterucci of Slate acknowledged internalized homophobia playing a part in some women who are same-sex attracted not using the word lesbian, she also attributed rejection of the term to inclusivity and wanting to use a broader term for spaces that were once traditionally labeled lesbian spaces. She stated that society has made it so that there is \\"more room for women than men to claim a fluid sexual orientation, meaning queer women are more likely to have current or former partners who aren't women\\" and that this is \\"why it's both easy and usually accurate to label circles of gay men as 'gay men'‚Äîand why gay men are relatively free from the perpetual infighting over labels and politics that seems common among segments of queer women.\\" She stated while there exists those who lament the losses of lesbian bars and media outlets, \\"it's worth wondering how we might expect a dance party or magazine to cater to us when our identities and politics appear to prevent us from sharing a name.\\" Julia Diana Robertson of AfterEllen, speaking on the word lesbian being villainized and therefore erased, argued that queer is being used in place of lesbian because it is without definitive sexual boundaries and is considered cooler, which sends the message to young lesbians \\"that if their sexuality doesn't leave room [for others], it's outdated, uncool, or somehow irrelevant. And that's just plain homophobia disguised as being progressive.\\" Cauterucci also stated, \\"Lesbian leaves no doubt that a woman's sexual and romantic affinities run toward other women. In a world that preferences heterosexual pairings, lesbians face a very different reality than queers-in-name-only, giving the term the power of a blunt, plainspoken, unapologetic declaration.\\" Mary Grace Lewis of The Advocate, arguing that lesbian is not a dirty word, stated that it \\"has been villainized in the media because [lesbians] serve no purpose to the people who control it.\\" She said that lesbian stereotypes seen in the media are not representative of the term, and that women accepting that they are not sexually attracted to men should not fear acknowledging it or feel that it is limiting. She felt that the more the term is used, \\"the more girls and women [will] feel comfortable\\" using it and the less it can be weaponized. In relation to butch lesbians and transgender men With regard to transgender men, some lesbians, radical feminists, authors, or commentators (both conservative and non-conservative) argue that transsexuality or transgender activism erases butch lesbians by making them feel that they should transition to men due to their gender nonconformity, or that older lesbians who figured out their identity would have felt that they should have been men growing up in today's culture. A number of lesbians say that they were tomboys or experienced gender dysphoria as a child. Some younger lesbians report having felt conflicted about whether to transition or say they felt pressured to transition and later detransitioned. Tristan Fox of AfterEllen stated that today's transgender movement pushes \\"young lesbians into believing they are male and amputating their healthy breasts and taking cross- hormones‚Äîevery butch knows what they are seeing. It's like looking into a mirror and recalling all of the angst, hatred, parental and peer rejection all over again.\\" Author Shannon Gilreath, commenting on \\"transsexuality as gay erasure\\", stated, \\"I have often wondered how much of transsexualism can be explained by an appalling self-hatred, an overwhelming need to not be gay‚Äîin other words, a self-liquidating homophobia. From this perspective, transsexualism is a way of avoiding being a femme gay man or a butch lesbian. Instead a femme gay man can actually be a 'straight woman' and a butch lesbian can actually be a 'straight man.'\\" He said that while he is aware of trans women who have undergone sex reassignment therapy and identify as lesbian and trans men who identify as gay, for his \\"theory on transsexuality to make sense at this point, one must pause to remember the importance of the gendered body and its relationship to compulsory heterosexuality under patriarchy/heteroarchy as 'a direct locus of social control.'\\" Katie Herzog of The Stranger stated, \\"There is a contingent of 'radical feminists' ('radfems' in internet parlance) who use [the stories of detransitioners] to argue that transitioning is a patriarchal attempt to reinforce gender roles and erase butch women.\\" She commented on the lack of certainty about why more people have come out as trans or non-binary, but said that \\"increased visibility and societal acceptance\\" of trans people are logical explanations for the matter. She reported on writer and trans activist Julia Serano arguing that more people coming out as trans is \\"due to the shift from the old gatekeeper system of trans health care to the newer model that 'takes trans people's experiences and concerns seriously.'\\" Arguing that \\"the idea that trans men are 'lesbians in denial' is demeaning and wrong\\", trans author Charlie Kiss, writing in The Economist, stated that he \\"could not have tried harder or longer to be a true lesbian\\" but that it never felt right. He also attributed the reported increase in the number of people assigned female questioning their gender identity or identifying as boys or men to an increase in visibility and it being \\"much harder to present as female and come out as a trans girl in secondary school, than it is to present as male and come out as a trans boy.\\" He added that \\"a rebalancing is under way because now, at last, trans men are getting some visibility in the media. That makes it easier for people to imagine this as their future; to envision possibilities and establish if they would be happier if they transitioned to male.\\" Butch lesbian Ruth Hunt, the head of Stonewall (charity), writing in The Independent, stated that \\"one particularly strange tactic that anti-trans campaigners use is presenting any move forward for trans rights as being inevitably at the cost of lesbian rights. Specifically the rights of young, butch lesbians. But the hard facts simply aren't there to back any of this up.\\" Hunt said that although \\"more young people are talking about their identity and how they feel\\" and \\"there's been an increase in the number of young women who are accessing age- appropriate support to help talk through these issues\\", \\"talking to a specialist is not the same as transitioning. Very few young people who access support go on to transition. This is what we would expect: that's what much successful gender treatment looks like.\\" In relation to transgender women Discord between cisgender lesbians and transgender women concerns the topic of sexual orientation and those who do and do not believe that trans women can be lesbians without erasing what it means to be a lesbian. Gina Davidson of The Scotsman stated, \\"At its heart is the focus on trans rights by LGBT organisations, and resultant philosophical and biological questions around what defines a woman, and its impact on sexual orientation and therefore lesbianism.\\" She commented, \\"Is lesbianism a sexual attraction only to female bodies or is it attraction to feminine identity? Can it involve trans women who still have male bodies?\\" The disputes have resulted in discord at LGBT events. New Zealand group Lesbian Rights Alliance Aotearoa was banned from marching in Wellington Pride because it was \\"'not being inclusive enough' of trans people\\", while individual members of LRAA were still able to march. At Vancouver, Canada's Dyke March, the group The Lesbians Collective was told to exclude lesbian pride placards and symbols which march organizers said were exclusionary of trans women. Such disputes have also occurred in the United States and in LGBT communities across the United Kingdom. The term lesbian erasure has been used by some radical feminists, such as members of the United Kingdom organization Get the L Out, which has a focus on trans women. The group, which proposes the creation of an autonomous lesbian community, argues that lesbians are \\"constantly vilified and excluded from the GBT community for stating their exclusive sexual preference\\", that the expansion of transgender rights erases lesbians, that transgender activism encourages lesbians to transition to straight men, and that the GBT community is becoming increasingly anti-lesbian and misogynistic. The group staged its first protest at the 2018 London Pride Parade and was condemned as transphobic or \\"anti- trans\\" by the organizers of Pride in London, and by The Guardian.London Pride Parade: * Applying the terms transphobic, bigot or similar terminology to lesbians who do not consider trans women, including those who have not gotten sex reassignment surgery, as sexual partners has been argued to be a form of lesbian erasure or conversion therapy. A situation in which a lesbian declines to date a trans woman may be referred to as \\"the cotton ceiling\\" (a phrase coined as a parallel with the glass ceiling to describe the difficulty transgender women face when seeking a romantic or sexual relationship with a cisgender lesbian). Terry MacDonald of the New Statesman stated that the term cotton ceiling \\"smacks of misogyny and male entitlement\\" and that \\"it isn't just radical feminists who find [calling lesbians transphobic for not accepting trans women as sexual partners] problematic: some trans women do too. Is that really just irrational bigotry?\\" MacDonald and scholars at Daily Nous stated that TERF (short for \\"trans exclusionary radical feminist\\") may also be used to refer to cisgender lesbians who are not sexually attracted to trans women. Feminist theorist Claire Heuchan cited use of \\"vaginophile\\", \\"vagina fetishist\\", \\"transmisogynist\\", and \\"penis demonizer\\" for cisgender lesbians who decline to date or have sex with trans women and stated that she has yet to see \\"a gay man accused of being a penis fetishist, penisphile, or vagina demonizer as a result of his sexuality ‚Äì that's reserved for the women. Somehow, it always is.\\" Sarah Ditum of the New Statesman stated that the sexual attraction debate matters so much to lesbians because they \\"have consistently faced everything from mockery to violence for insisting on boundaries to their sexuality\\" and that some have experienced corrective rape. Heuchan said that \\"women have spent the last few thousand years being conditioned and coerced into having sex that involves a penis\\" and that it is unfair and dehumanizing \\"to reduce lesbian women's sexuality into nothing more than a source of validation for trans women.\\" She said it \\"is dangerous to conflate women treating someone with respect with women considering someone as a potential sexual partner, especially in a political context where women's rights face fresh jeopardy.\\" Heuchan argued that \\"lesbian is again a contested category\\" and \\"even acknowledging lesbian visibility is described as 'dogwhistle transphobia'. ... Lesbophobia isn't coming from social conservatism as it has in the past, but within the LGBT+ community.\\" African- American lesbian performance artist and writer Pippa Fleming, writing in The Economist, stated, \\"Lesbian identity is now being dubbed as exclusionary or transphobic. You're damn right it's exclusive: lesbians have a right to say no to the phallus, no matter how it's concealed or revealed.\\" She added that \\"patriarchy and sex-based oppression are real, and they remain the driving force behind the invisibility of black lesbians. The gender-identity movement's attempt to rebrand the lesbian as queer, and the pronouncement that 'anyone can be a lesbian', are nothing short of erasure.\\" Some LGBT activists have opposed use of the term lesbian erasure with regard to transgender activism. In a 2018 open letter opposing this use, twelve editors and publishers of eight lesbian publications stated, \\"We do not think supporting trans women erases our lesbian identities; rather we are enriched by trans friends and lovers, parents, children, colleagues and siblings.\\" Carrie Lyell, editor of DIVA magazine and creator of the letter, stated that \\"while there's no denying women are marginalised within the LGBT+ movement, this having anything to do with trans people, or trans issues, is news to me.\\" She referred to the argument that trans women are pressuring lesbians to \\"accept them as sexual partners\\" as \\"scaremongering\\". Shannon Keating of BuzzFeed argued that \\"though lesbians are by no means under attack by gains in trans acceptance, it's true that American attitudes about gender identity are evolving, which has started to impact the way many of us think about sexual orientation.\\" Abigail Curlew of Vice argued that noting that cisgender people may find themselves sexually attracted to a trans woman, especially if relaxing their \\"preconceived notions and stereotypes of transgender folks\\", is \\"very different than saying that if you're not attracted to trans women you are transphobic.\\" She said she is not shaming people for their sexual orientation or stating that there is no biological influence, but is instead noting societal prejudice and asking them to \\"critically reflect on the factors that might shape [their] attractions.\\" Author Morgan Lev Edward Holleb argued that lesbians who are trans exclusionary radical feminists \\"are absolutely horrified at the possibility of being attracted to a trans woman because it would undermine their status as the bastion of lesbian separatist feminists, being attracted to someone they incorrectly consider a 'man.'\\" Holleb added that transgender people \\"are acutely aware of the biological differences between [trans] and cis people\\" and that \\"trans people aren't trying to 'erase' biological differences, we're trying to secure our basic rights, and highlight shared struggles when we talk about activism and justice.\\"  See also  * Bisexual erasure * Lesbian Avengers * Queer erasure * Straightwashing Notes  References  Further reading  (Sister Outrider received the 2016 Best Blog award from Write to End Violence Against Women.)    ;Books and journals  (via University of Leicester)  Category:Lesbian feminism Category:Lesbian history Category:Lesbophobia Category:Political lesbianism Category:LGBT erasure ","title":"Lesbian erasure"},{"id":"61080888","text":"Porthmadog railway station is a National Rail station in Porthmadog, Wales Porthmadog railway station may also refer to: * Porthmadog Harbour railway station, on the Ffestiniog & Welsh Highland Railways * Porthmadog railway station (Welsh Highland Heritage Railway) ","title":"Porthmadog railway station (disambiguation)"},{"id":"61080965","title":"List of cities in Ishikawa Prefecture by population"},{"id":"61081068","text":"Geodia apiarium is a species of sea sponge in the family Geodiidae.

During the campaign he openly identified himself as gay and as a member of the Gay Liberation Front, and in an interview with Gay News he reported that his sexuality had been extensively covered in the press and had attracted negative comments from opponents. He was elected to the seat, ousting an 18-year incumbent councillor. As one of his actions as a councillor, he asked for Gay News to be stocked in the city's libraries.

Founded in 2012, it offers products and services to help other companies manage and curate large amounts of data.  History  Qumulo was founded in March 2012 by Neal Fachan, Peter Godman, and Aaron Passey. They all previously worked at Isilon, a storage platform that was acquired by EMC. Several of Qumulo's key employees are also former Isilon employees. The company received $2.3-million seed funding from investment company Valhalla Partners. In November 2012, it secured an additional $24.5 million from a Series A round led by Highland Capital Partners. By the end of its first year, the company had raised a total of $26.8 million while releasing few details about its possible product offering. After an 18-month development period in 2013‚Äì2014, Qumulo began selling its products in August 2014. Six months after its product release, the company announced completion of a $40-million funding series led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Before entering the development period, Qumulo employed 18 people which increased to 90 by February 2015 and to 150 employees in January 2016. The company remained secretive about its product offering until March 2015, when it finally offered specific details of its software, describing it as a \\"data aware\\" storage system. This was followed by a $32.5-million funding series in June 2016 adding new investor Allen & Company. However, the company's share price had dropped by more than 35% when compared to previous rounds and the funds generated were below the company's expectations. In November 2016, Qumulo hired Bill Richter to succeed Godman as CEO. Godman continued as CTO until the end of 2018. Qumulo raised $30 million additional funds in April 2017 and $93 million in June 2018, bringing it total funding to $230 million. In January 2019, the company opened offices in Vancouver, Canada. It employs approximately 220 people as of April 2019.  Products  Qumulo develops storage software for file-based data. The file system software can be deployed with on-premise data centers on Qumulo's network-attached storage hardware, as well as on Hewlett Packard Enterprise Apollo and Dell PowerEdge R740xd platforms.

After potential buyers were threatened with firearms, and some were seriously injured, New York Governor Alonzo Cornell proclaimed on February 11, 1882 that an insurrection existed in Greenwood. Some property was successfully sold in February and March, and the governor lifted the proclamation in June. Background The Rochester, Hornellsville, and Pine Creek Railroad had articles of association filed on March 30, 1871 in New York and the company was formed according to the railroad laws of the state. It planned to build a railroad line from Hornellsville to the New York-Pennsylvania state line. Greenwood, population 1,400 in 1882, and other communities through which the line would run, borrowed money to pay for the railroad construction. In Greenwood's case $30,000 (); Hornellsville borrowed $70,000 and West Union $41,000. Work on the railroad ended with the Panic of 1873, which brought railroad bankruptcies and bank failures. The railroad was never built, and Greenwood had \\"nothing to show for its bonds except a few miles of inexpensive grading.\\" In 1872, the town of Greenwood was bonded for $30,000, but a judge of the Court of Appeals found that the bonds were illegal in November 1873 because commissioners violated an agreement about ensuring it was legal. The jubilation of the people of Greenwood over this decision was short lived, as the New York Legislature passed a law in May 1874 legalizing the acts of the commissioners. The insurrection Greenwood paid interest on the loan until 1874, when the entire principal was due. In order to repay the loan, a tax of $8000 was imposed on the citizens of Greenwood. Since they had been \\"defrauded and robbed\\", the residents refused to pay it, although they continued paying county and state taxes. Most of the people in Greenwood were very bitter and made threats of injury or death. From 1878 to 1882, there were several unsuccessful attempts to sell lots to pay for the debt, but in the process, several would be purchasers were seriously injured. The tax collector in February of 1878 offered for sale several lots of personal property which had been levied upon for the payment of taxes due. About two hundred people assembled at the place of sale and threatened bodily harm of potential buyers with guns and revolvers. When no one would made a bid, the sale was adjourned. Governor Alonzo B. Cornell, to whom the sheriff sent a telegram, responded that the sheriff must exhaust his powers before the state would become involved. The sheriff formed a posse of 50 men to attend a sale in April 1878 to sell the lots, but it was unsuccessful. On February 7, 1882, the collector attempted to make 98 sales. There was a posse of 40 men, met by a group of 250 taxpayers, who were reported to be quiet and orderly or according to the Buffalo Weekly Express, the citizens were well armed, with martial music and hard cider. The collector claimed that he was not sure of the legality of the levies, and adjourned the sales indefinitely. Miners and oil men from Pennsylvania, just over the border from Greenwood, helped the Greenwood citizen's attempts at resistance. Molly Maguires from Pennsylvania may have been present. The Governor's proclamation Since the telegram sent to the Governor in 1878 did not result in assistance from the state, the sheriff traveled to Albany to present the situation to Governor Alonzo B. Cornell, informing him that several would-be purchasers were seriously injured. In response, Governor Cornell proclaimed on February 11, 1882 that a state of insurrection existed. In the proclamation, he stated that citizens of Greenwood had unlawfully assembled, issued threats, and prevented the collection of taxes as well as the actions of the officers of law. He ordered Greenwood citizens to \\"desist from any attempt\\" to violate peace, to threaten others, or to prevent officers of the law from their duties. Otherwise, they are \\"commanded to disperse and depart to their respective places of abode\\" and officers of the law were commanded to use any legal process necessary to maintain order. Aftermath On February 14 the Sheriff was more successful. He was able to collect a few of the delinquent taxes were paid to-day, and it is was reported that most of the $8,000 due would be collected. At another announced sale in March, the Sheriff and a party of thirty-three retainers sold sell property seized for unpaid taxes, starting with the sale of livestock that had been owned by widows and poor men. One of the widows preeminently sold her horse, one widow's horse brought $3; and no one would bid for a poor man's cow. The Sheriff then levied on some farmers, and in the end managed to collect a portion of his claim. The insurrection over and the tax paid, the Governor declared the insurrection ended in June.

Bern is also a member of Svenska Dagbladet. Bern has stated if Sweden did not intended to maintain nuclear power, it would be necessary to produce it for other countries for environmental reasons. In his book, \\"Varf√∂r f√∂rsvinner v√•ra kronjuveler\\", Bern criticized Swedish corporations, specially the Wallenberg-family, for moving their industries to third world countries and taking away jobs from the Swedish market.  Climate change debate  Lars Bern has 35 years of experience in environmental studies and is the founder of foundation Det Naturliga Steget and was previously CEO of √Öngpannef√∂reningen and IVL (Swedish Environmental Institute). In 2008, Bern published an article originally from News Mill but borrowed by Archive.is saying that \\"20 top scientists agree that carbon dioxide does not affect the environment\\". In Klimatupplysningen, a Swedish climate debating movement, Bern stated that the climate change movement is similar to a religious doom cult which legtimizes politicians' rights in the West to increase taxes. In an article published by DagensSPS in 2009, Bern stated that the \\"picture of the climate threats are exaggerated.\\". In an interview on Swebbtv with the host Mikael Willgert, Bern stated that climate politics is a propaganda tool used to frighten the Swedish public. Bern has also heavily criticized SVT (Swedens State Television) saying they spread disinformation about climate change and distort research information about melting ice. Bern states that the climate change is due to natural causes and that the anthropogenic effect is minimal. Bern has criticized reporter Kerstin Unger-Sal√©n, wife of Anders Wijkman, head of the Club of Rome, saying she attacked a straw-man and spread disinformation about Bern's standpoint on the climate change debate. Bern has also stated that the \\"doomsday climate sect is making Sweden and Swedish families poor\\".  Skeptic of globalism  In an article from V√§rlden Idag, Bern said that the United Nations' plan, Agenda 2030, aims transfer of power to global corporations from democratically elected leaders and sovereign nations. He said, \\"The anglo- American hegemony has long ruled the world. The Royal Navy, the British Royal Navy, occupied the trading routes. Their role with control over the world trade was handed over to the Americans who now are trying to exercise power by control the trading routes. The US position is however failing. Who is it really that has ruled up to now? At the beginning it was the royal. Then the democratic institutions came, but now the power is slowly slipping out of their hands. The big global corporates that have developed dominates the economy and their final goal is total and unequivocal power\\". Bern has stated that there are massive consequences for the Swedish public economy, saying wages stagnate due to the migration policy of the Swedish government and that debts are rising. Bern has criticized George Soros calling him an \\"evil villain\\".  Criticism  Lars Bern has been accused of being a climate change denier by Uppsalainitiativet, in an article discussing his 2016 theory that discussion of climate change was being used to justify what he thought were plans by the U.S. to bomb power plants in China, India and other locations. Bern has also been called a conspiracy theorist. Svenska Dagbladet has criticized Bern saying he denies the \\"laws of physics\\". Expressen has accused Bern of having formed the environmental policy for the Sweden Democrats.

The book is being reprinted in 2020 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This is Sullivan's first book of poetry, and it won the T.S. Eliot Prize (2018) for the best new poetry collection published in Great Britain or Ireland. Sullivan wrote short poems until she attended a poetry workshop taught by Jorie Graham; this is her first published long poem. When working on Three Poems, she started out writing fragments before deciding for sure what she wanted to write about.  Content  =\\"You, Very Young in New York\\"= The first poem, \\"You, Very Young in New York\\", depicts a young woman's recollections of everyday encounters in New York. While she is own her own for the first time, she is longing for adventure but it seems to be happening to someone else. Sullivan describes an indulgence where the young woman feel incomplete unless she can learn to fit into her surrounding environment. This sense of yearning is conveyed in the opening: > Rosy used to say that New York was a fairground. ‚ÄòYou will know when it‚Äôs > time, when the fair is over.‚Äô But nothing seems to happen. You stand around > On the same street corners, smoking, thin-elbowed, Looking down avenues in a > lime-green dress With one arm raised, waiting to get older. Nothing happens. = \\"Repeat Until Time: The Heraclitus Poem\\" = The second poem is separated into numbered sections. Sullivan uses this poem to reference films, pop culture, and technology. Sullivan describes the same woman moving to California. From San Francisco to the British town of Rye, she discovers an environment marked by repetition. The people around her have a specific routine that they stick by. Sullivan theorizes the impossibility of originality: > There is saying something the same thing in a different form, There is > saying something new in the same form, There is saying the same thing again > in the same form There is not much saying something new in a new form = \\"The Sandpit After Rain\\" = The last poem describes life and death, and it notes how they are similar. More specifically, the young woman deals with pregnancy, the death of her father, and the birth of her first child. Sullivan states in the acknowledgments that this poem is in memory of her father, John O'Sullivan (1950‚Äì2014) > The baby did not look like my father at all, But there was a resemblance: > Our slight awkwardness with each other  Style  Sullivan used many styles of writing including prose poetry and free verse in both contemporary and modern forms. The first poem consists of rhymes and half rhymes, but the poem in a whole is very versatile in style. While the collection has a number of rhymes and short lines, there is not a set style that used throughout. Sullivan told the Los Angeles Review of Books that, while she was brainstorming, she thought to herself, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll try and write something in rhyming couplets.‚Äù She said, \\"Once you start writing in rhyming couplets, a different tone of voice comes in\\".  Criticism  Roger Cox from The Scotsman stated, \\"The opening section of the first of these poems, 'You, Very Young in New York', is one of the most aesthetically pleasing things I have read in a long time\\". Lavinia Greenlaw from London Review of Books stated, \\"Three Poems has an aerated extravagance that brings to mind Wallace Stevens‚Äôs ‚ÄòParfait Martinique: coffee mousse, rum on top, a little cream on top of that\\". Paul Batchelor, in a review in New Statesman, described the collection as \\"a richly rewarding collection that shows all the confidence and skill of a poet writing in their prime\\".

Retrocessions have been heavily criticized, due to a possible conflict of interest and a lack of transparency in the past. The Swiss federal tribunal has stated on various occasions that commissions create a conflict of interest as a bank is incentivised to acquire a certain product, whereas the operation is not justified with regards to the interest of the client. In the European Union a major transformation of the financial market has led to a number of regulations that intend to make the financial industry more transparent and accountable. Retrocessions are a type of inducement that are considered non-transparent and therefore regulators have sought a way to drastically reduce them or even ban them completely. As of 2019, inducements are completely banned in only three countries of the EU (the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands). Broadly used synonyms for retrocessions are finder's fee, referral fee, sales commission, acquisition commission, hidden commission, or, as above mentioned, kick-back commission.  History  Retrocessions have for many years been a well-established, common and lucrative business model for Swiss banks, asset management companies and financial service providers. According to a study published by Finalix AG, retrocessions accounted for an estimated 12.4% of the Swiss banking sector's added value in 2012., amounting to CHF 4.2 Billion. Retrocessions are a form of financial inducement that Swiss banks and asset managers received from asset managers, whose products they pushed to their wealth management clients.  Criticism  = Conflicts of interest = It is argued that banks and asset managers face a conflict of interest when buying financial products that pay a certain percentage in kick-back commissions. When deciding on which fund or structured product to buy, the asset manager in charge should merely act in the interest of his client and hence buy the fund, share, structured product etc. with the best performance. However, as kick-back commissions vary broadly between 0.5 and 2% and in most cases are paid back to the buyer independently from the financial product's performance, the bank or asset manager might aim to maximizing profits by buying products that pay the highest retrocessions. The BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, gives the following example: ‚ÄúIf a bank receives a commission from an issuer for the sale of certain securities, this commission and the amount of the commission may pose an incentive for the bank to allow itself to be swayed when providing investment advice to the client. The client‚Äôs interest could thus be subordinated to the bank‚Äôs interest in selling the security. = Missing disclosure of the inducements = Another point of criticism is that banks and asset managers for years failed to disclose the amount of retrocessions received. Many banks and asset managers received retrocessions in addition to the fees charged without informing their clients sufficiently. Some made their clients sign waivers, without informing them, for what exactly they are signing the waivers for. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court (FSC 137 III 393) decided that an asset manager is entitled to retain retrocessions and other distribution fees received only if three rules are met: Firstly, the client has to be informed about retrocessions by defining the parameters based on which the retrocessions are calculated, and a range of the expected compensation, expressed as a percentage of the assets under management, has to be provided and has to be put into perspective with the management fees. Secondly, once the client is informed about the amount of retrocessions the asset manager will receive, the client has to sign a valid and comprehensive waiver based on the informed consent. And thirdly, the client must be informed about the risks that arise out of a conflict of interest generated by retrocessions and the measures taken by the asset manager to avoid or mitigate them. The legislation and rules is similar in other countries. However, as most banks and asset managers have not informed their clients sufficiently about the retrocessions generated, many clients have the right to assert their claims on retrocessions. = Independent of performance = Retrocessions are usually not paid out or received based on the performance of the financial product; this means that even if the client's portfolio showed a negative performance, asset managers still received on the one hand their contractually agreed banking fees from the clients and on the other hand, retrocessions worth between 0.5 ‚Äì 2% of the assets under management.  Argumentation in favour of retrocessions  Banks and asset managers argue that without retrocession fees the substantial charges would have to be made to the client in order to pay for the ongoing service that the bank provides today mostly free of charge. Asset managers that retain retrocessions argue that they are needed for providing general services such as maintaining a website.  Legal Situation  = Switzerland =  Supreme Court Ruling 22.03.2006  The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland found in a major decision in 2006 (BGE 132 II 460 ff). This groundbreaking decisions stated that kickbacks distributed paid to external asset managers belong to the client and therefore have to be forwarded to them.  Supreme Court Ruling 30.10.2012  The second Judgement of the Swiss Federal Court (4A_127/2012, 4A_141/2012) concerning retrocessions decided that banks are also not entitled to keep retrocessions received when buying in-house products for client portfolios. Such as in 2006, the possible conflict of interest was key for the Federal Supreme Court decision.  Supreme Court Ruling 16.06.2017  The judgement (4A_508/2016) delivered by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court on 16. June 2017 clarifies the statutory limitation of retrocessions. Clients can recover retrocessions withheld by Swiss asset management companies retroactively for the last 10 years. The statutory limitation period begins on the day on which the Swiss asset management company received the retrocession.  Trade Court Ruling 15.11.2017  HG 150054 states: Clients with execution-only-mandates also have a right to receive the retrocessions and finder's fees that were unlawfully retained by Swiss banks and asset managers.  Supreme Court Ruling 14.08.2018  In ruling 6B_689/2016, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court held that the failure to disclose adequately retrocessions may constitute an act of criminal mismanagement. = Germany = With the implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) by the Second Financial Market Regulatory Act (2nd FiMaNoG), the transfer of funds to asset managers in Germany was set out in Section 64 (7) WpHG introduced a general ban on accepting and retaining contributions from third parties or persons acting for them. The ban has been in force since 3 January 2018. The previous exemption, according to which such allowances could be collected if they improved the quality of the services provided to the customer and were disclosed to the customer, has been dropped. Section 64 (7) sentence 4 of the WpHG now expressly provides that all monetary benefits assumed in connection with financial portfolio management are to be distributed to the customer as soon as reasonably possible after receipt and in full. = Liechtenstein = In Liechtenstein, there is no relevant case law for the recovery of retrocessions arising from asset-liability contracts, in contrast to Switzerland. However, as in Switzerland, the contractual nature of an asset management agreement implies that the customer is entitled to all the benefits of the management of the business, including, in particular, retrocessions. The customer can demand from his asset manager the release of all retrocessions. Unlike in Switzerland, however, there is a more favorable limitation period for customers in Liechtenstein. This is 30 years, and it is therefore possible for the customer to recover retrocessions for a much longer period of time. = United Kingdom = The UK is besides Denmark and The Netherlands the only European country to prohibit inducements completely. UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced this measure to end conflicts of interest, increase transparency and strengthen the professional qualifications of advisors.  Who is affected?  Investor rights‚Äô specialists claim that anybody who held investments with a Swiss bank, asset management company or trustee under an asset management contract, investment consulting contract or a pure account/depot-relationship (execution only contract) are affected by unlawfully withheld retrocessions and able to demand repayment. There are no official numbers stating the exact number of clients of Swiss banks and asset management companies that are effected by unlawfully withheld retrocessions. According to estimations there are at least 120‚Äô000 affected German investors, likely more than 40'000 affected French investors and approximately 40'000 affected Austrian investors  Claiming back retrocessions  So far, no Swiss bank has published an official guideline on how to claim back unlawfully withheld retrocessions. On the contrary, banks largely ignore the topic, tell their clients that they have no right to assert their claims or even leave requests unanswered. Although the legal situation on retrocessions is clear private investors are almost chanceless when claiming kick-back commissions back from Swiss banks. Therefore, some Swiss service providers such as Liti- Link AG and LEGAFUND have specialized on recovering claims on retrocessions for private and institutional investors before they expire (10 year statute of limitations), without risk and with a high chance of success.

Early life  Annette Ashberry was born in Hackney on 9 March 1894 to Israel and Leah Annenberg, part of a large Jewish immigrant family from Russia. She had six brothers and five sisters. Her father changed their surname from Annenberg to Ashberry in response to the anti-German sentiment which built ahead of the First World War.  Career  Like many women, Ashberry worked on munitions during the First World War. She began her career in engineering in 1916, inspecting fuses in a factory. She had a keen interest in engineering which led to her working for British Thomson-Houston dealing with magnetos. Ashberry joined the Galloway Engineering Company's (mainly female staffed) Tongland factory near Kirkcudbright and became the Secretary of the Tongland Branch of the Women's Engineering Society (WES), which was formed in 1919 following a visit of the first WES secretary Caroline Haslett. Ashberry and fellow Galloway Engineering Company engineer Dora Turner wrote about their views of the future of women in engineering, including the question \\"Would it not be possible for other firms to build and equip factories especially for women labour?\\". The end of hostilities brought a slowdown in her career opportunities, and Ashberry began studying for a BSc in engineering at Loughborough Technical College. The newly formed Women's Engineering Society then encouraged her to open an engineering factory which focused on employing women. In 1920, Ashberry founded Atalanta Ltd in Loughborough, along with Rachel Parsons, Caroline Haslett, Lady Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Dora Turner, and Herbert Schofield, the head of Loughborough Technical College. After installing power to their basic premises, the women produced hand scraped surface plates and oil burners. After facing problems securing payments from customers, they reduced staff to just Annette and one other woman, and moved premises to London in hope of establishing business contacts there. In 1922, they moved to Brixton, London, and started to see successes. The same year Ashberry won a prize from the Women's Engineering Society for the design of a dishwasher and obtained her first patent for a vegetable peeler. In 1925, Ashberry was the first woman to be elected to the Society of Engineers and delivered the first address by a woman to the Society's members on 1 November 1926. By 1937, Ashberry had closed Atalanta Ltd. for business and moved into an entirely different field of work: miniature gardens. She started a business in Kensington producing landscapes in ordinary window boxes which she sold to elderly and disabled gardeners and those living in flats. The Second World War brought a necessary return to engineering for Ashberry, but in 1945 she was able to purchase a cottage in Chignall Smealy and resume her miniature gardening business. In this field she was better known as Anne Ashberry and became famous for her nursery and designs. She exhibited at Chelsea Flower Shows, The Festival of Britain Exhibition and on television. She published 7 books, starting with Miniature Gardens in 1952. A film about miniature gardens featuring Ashberry was made by British Path√© in 1952. Other notable books included Bottled Garden and Fern Cases (1964) and Alpine Lawns (1966). Ashberry died in Chelmsford, Essex on 2 September 1990, aged 96.

Metje has also been involved in discussions about the refurbishment of Birmingham's Queensway and St Chad's tunnels.  Awards and Honours  Metje became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in 2009. Metje became a Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors and Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2015. In 2018, Metje won the Institution of Civil Engineers West Midlands Studies and Research Award for the FINDIT: Finding Infrastructure with Non-Destructive Testing project. The project created a sub-surface mapping system locating buried services accurately and indicating their condition. In 2019, Metje again won the Institution of Civil Engineers West Midlands Studies and Research Award for the Quantum Technology ‚Äì Potential for Railway Applications project, which uses non-intrusive technology to help minimise disruption to railway passengers and improve maintenance efficiency.

Gandhi‚Äôs research demonstrates how American practices of yoga can be understood within the broader history of structural racism in the United States.  Early life and education  Gandhi was born in London, United Kingdom. At age six, her family moved to The Bronx, New York. Gandhi graduated from Swarthmore Collegein 2001, and then completed her master's degree at Harvard Divinity School under the mentorship of Robert Orsi. In 2009, Gandhi completed her doctoral research in Religious Studies at The University of Florida. Her dissertation was advised by Vasudha Naraganan.  Research and academic career  From 2010 to 2016, Gandhi was a professor of religion at Kalamazoo College, where she was also a social justice fellow at the Arcus Center. In 2016, she was hired by Michigan State University and moved to East Lansing. Gandhi's early research focused on yoga in popular culture. Through eight peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, Gandhi established that yoga in the United States has been shaped and commodified as a practice in exercise and wellbeing. This commodification has shifted discourses of yoga in ways that reflect the bodies and identities of suburban America, particularly the values embodied by white, upper-class women. She was solicited to write the entry for \\"yoga\\" in The Encyclopedia of Global Religion. In her subsequent work, Gandhi has pivoted to a broader assessment of how Americans from all backgrounds, including many immigrants, have both benefited and suffered from the national legacy of white supremacy. Gandhi has held a number of leadership positions within the American Academy of Religion, including as co-chair of the North American Hinduism unit, and on the steering committees for the Yoga in Theory and Practice and North American Religion programs. In 2019, she was selected as a member of the inaugural fellows cohort for Sacred Writes, a public scholarship initiative funded by the Henry Luce Foundation.

Biography Tom Derek Bowden was born in Surrey, the son of a well-to-do South London family. Bowden married Eva Heilbronner with whom he had four children. Military career Bowden enlisted the British cavalry in 1938 at age 17, and serving in Mandatory Palestine with the Royal Scots Greys. He served under Orde Wingate. In 1941, Bowden, now an officer, led a British cavalry charge into battle on horseback against Vichy forces in Vichy-held Syria-Lebanon. Sergeant Moshe Dayan, Bowden's guide, lost an eye in the campaign. Bowden, was badly wounded in the leg. After six months recovery at the home of the Appel family in Tel Aviv, Bowden volunteered for the Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom). He trained in Egypt, and fought in Sicily, Italy and on D-Day with the Special Air Service, and parachuted into the Battle of Arnhem, where he was taken prisoner. When his German captors discovered letters from his Israeli girlfriend, kibbutznik, Hannah Appel, in his gear, the officer who examined his papers said to him, \\"Now you will see how we treat the Jews,'\\" and sent him to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where he was made to work carting Jewish corpses to disposal pits. After a month at Bergen-Belsen, Bowden was sent to a POW camp near Hamburg where he remained until liberation. After the war, Bowden went to Yugoslavia, then ruled by Marshall Tito , to work as a parachute instructor. \\"But the Israeli thing was starting up and I thought to myself, I'd better get there - we don't want another Belsen.\\" Bowden entered British Mandatory Palestine clandestinely, through Cyprus, joining the Haganah under a pseudonym, Captain David Appel, although he spoke no Hebrew. He served at the Battle of Latrun, fighting alongside Holocaust survivors to keep the road between Jerusalem and the coast open. He later told an interviewer for The Guardian, \\"We were up against the British army-trained Trans-Jordan Frontier Force and had no water or supplies. I was in command of a lot of Polish chaps who only spoke Yiddish, so I had to learn a few words to order them to fire at the enemy.\\" After the accidental shooting of Mickey Marcus, an American volunteer fighting for Israel who was mistaken for an Arab when he stepped from his field tent and did not realise that he was being asked in Hebrew for a password, the English-speaking 7th volunteer Brigade was formed. Bowden led a unit that fought in the Galilee. In 1998, Bowden told an interviewer that he, like everyone else, knew that Arab armies would attack the Jews as soon as the British withdrew, \\"I was going to make sure they didn't get stamped on. (The Arabs) were going to kill the whole sodding lot of them! I'd seen enough annihilation.\\" In 1949, Chaim Laskov asked Captain Bowden to create a paratroop school, and to establish the predecessor of the Paratroopers Brigade. He did so, writing a training manual with the help of his Hebrew-speaking secretary Eva Heilbronner and training soldiers with British Army surplus equipment.

It can also be used for whole plant communities. Rationale Different organs of plants serve different functions. Leaves generally intercept light and fix carbon, roots take up water and nutrients, and stems and petioles display the leaves in a favourable position and transport various compounds within the plant. Depending on environmental conditions, plants may change their investment scheme, to make plants with relatively bigger root systems, or more leaves. This balance has been suggested to be a ‚Äòfunctional equilibrium‚Äô, with plants that experience low water or nutrient supply investing more in roots, and plants growing under low light or CO2 conditions investing more in leaves or stems. Alternatively, it is also known as the 'balanced growth hypothesis', or the 'optimal partitioning theory'. Next to environmentally-induced changes, there are also inherent differences in biomass allocation between species, and changes that depend on the age or size of plants.  Related concepts  Biomass allocation is the end result of a number of processes which take place in the plant. It starts with the way how sugars are allocated over the different organs after having been fixed by the leaves in the process of photosynthesis (sugar allocation). Conceptually this is simple to envisage, but to quantify the flow of sugars is challenging and requires sophisticated machinery. For plants growing under steady state conditions, it is feasible to determine sugar-allocation by constructing a C-budget. This requires determination of the C-uptake by the whole plant during photosynthesis, and the C-losses of shoots and roots during respiration. Further C-losses may occur when sugars and other C-based compounds are exuded by the roots, or disappear as volatiles in the leaves. When these measurements are combined with growth measurements and the C-concentrations present in the biomass of leaves, stems and roots, C-budgets can be constructed from which sugar allocation is derived. These C-budgets are instructive, but require extensive measurements. A next level of analysis is to measure the growth allocation: what is the increase in total biomass of a plant, and to what extent is the increase due to growth of leaves, of stems and of roots. In young plants, growth allocation is often quite similar to the actual biomass allocation. But especially in trees, there may be a high yearly turnover in leaves and fine roots, and a low turnover in stems, branches and thick roots. In those cases, the allocation of growth and the final biomass allocation may diverge quite strongly over the years. There have been attempts to give these three different levels of allocation different names (a.o. partitioning, distribution, fractionation), but so far they have been applied inconsistently. The fractions of biomass present in leaves and roots are also relevant variables in Plant growth analysis. Calculation and units A common way to characterize the biomass allocation of a vegetative plant is to separate the plant in the organs of interest (e.g. leaves, stems, roots) and determine the biomass of these organs ‚Äì generally on a dry mass basis - independently. The Leaf Mass Fraction (LMF) is then calculated as leaf dry mass / total plant dry mass, the Stem Mass Fraction (SMF) as stem dry mass / total plant dry mass, and Root Mass Fraction (RMF) as root dry mass / total plant dry mass. Generally, units are g g‚àí1 (g organ / g total plant biomass). For generative plants, there is the additional compartment related to reproduction (flowers and flower stalks, seeds or fruits). The relative amount of biomass present in this compartment is often indicated as 'Reproductive Effort'. A related variable which is often used in agronomy is the 'Harvest index'. Because roots are seldomly harvested, the harvest index is the amount of marketable product (often the seeds), relative to the total above-ground biomass. Alternative terminology that has been used are Leaf, Stem and Root Mass Ratios, or shoot:root or root:shoot ratios. The latter two convey less information, as they do not discriminate between leaves and stems.  Normal ranges  Young herbaceous plants generally have LMF values in the range of 0.3 - 0.7 g g‚àí1 (0.5 on average), SMF values ranging from 0.04 - 0.4 (0.2 on average), and RMF values between 0.1 and 0.5 (0.3 on average). Young tree seedlings have values in the same range. For older and bigger plants, the LMF decreases and SMF increases. For large trees (> 1000 kg) LMF is below 0.05, SMF around 0.8 and RMF around 0.2 g g‚àí1. At that stage most of the stem biomass consists of highly lignified material, which still may serve the important function of contributing to the support function of stems, but is physiologically not active anymore.  Environmental effects  The effect of the environment generally is as expected from the ‚Äòfunctional equilibrium‚Äô concept: plants decrease LMF and increase RMF when grown at high light levels as compared to low light. At low nutrient levels they invest more in roots and less in leaves as compared to high nutrient supply. However, changes are often smaller at different water supply, and effects of CO2 concentration, UV-B radiation, ozone and salinity on allocation are generally negligible. Plants growing at higher temperature mostly decrease RMF and increase LMF. A point of attention in the analysis of mass fractions is whether or not to correct for differences in size, when comparing plants that have been treated differently, or in the comparison of species. The rationale behind this is that mass factions often change with plant size (and developmental phase), and different treatments may have caused growth differences as well. Thus, for an assessment of whether plants actively changed their allocation scheme, plants of similar size should be compared. If size corrections are required, one could do an allometric analysis. A simple alternative is to plot mass fractions against total plant mass.  Differences between species  Species of different families may have different allocation patterns. For example, species belonging to the Solanaceae have high LMF values, whereas Fagaceae have low LMF values, even after size-corrections.

Reffo taught before becoming a priest and collaborated for most of his life with religious newspapers in Turin before collaborating with Leonardo Murialdo in the founding of a religious congregation. He went blind in his last two decades but would continue to dictate his articles until his death. He also was responsible for administration and expansion for the order and during his time helped expand the order on an international level. The process for his prospective beatification opened in the late 1970s after the Murialdines decided to launch his cause and he became titled as a Servant of God. It made its next major stride in mid-2014 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and titled the late priest as Venerable. Life Eugenio Reffo was born in Turin on 2 January 1843 as the last of five children to Pietro Reffo and Carolina Piana. He had two brothers and two sisters who were all his seniors. His eldest brother Enrico (1931-1917) became a painter while Ermanno died aged 42 and in his life collaborated with the Vincentian Conference. His sister Ildegarde entered the Merici Sisters as a professed religious and his last sister was Adila. Reffo was baptized just hours after he was born in the metropolitan cathedral as \\"Eugenio Giuseppe\\". He first studied under the De La Salle Brothers in Turin. From May 1855 until its closure in 1859 he studied as a student at a Jesuit-run boarding school in Massa in Modena; its closure forced him to return to Turin where he did private philosophical studies until 1861. Reffo graduated and then from 2 November 1861 began teaching students though later set his sights on entering the priesthood which forced him to stop teaching so he could commence his ecclesial studies. He did his theological studies until he was ordained to the priesthood on 26 May 1866. In 1867 he travelled to Rome and then in Naples met Ludovico da Casoria. Following his ordination in 1869 he started to collaborate and write articles for the religious newspaper L'Unit√† Cattolica until 1892 when it moved to Florence; he began working with another newspaper until his death. In summer 1872 he travelled to France where he stopped in Paris and met with religious brothers to understand their experiences and to learn about religious communities. Reffo later met Leonardo Murialdo at some stage and the two co-founded the Congregation of Saint Joseph - or Murialdines - on 19 March 1873. It was on that date that Reffo and four others joined the order and made their initial religious vows. He and three others would later make their solemn religious profession on 19 September 1891. In 1892 he suffered a severe illness but recovered; this led his brother Enrico to paint an image of Saint Joseph in thanksgiving for his brother recovering. Reffo began suffering from retinal problems on 2 April 1895 which saw him start to lose his sight in his right eye. He had an operation in the hopes of treating it though some months after went blind in that eye. In 1900 he was elected as Superior General (following the death of Murialdo) but he did not accept the position (Giulio Costantino was elected instead) and instead was made the order's vicar general. Reffo became Superior General after Costantino later on 26 March 1912 and his term ended in 1919 after he went blind in his left eye in 1917 which saw him unable to manage his duties. He continued to dictate articles for the newspaper he collaborated with following his going blind and would do this until his death just under a decade later. In 1917 he allowed Giovanni Schiavo to be admitted into the order; Schiavo would later work in the missions for the order in Brazil. In 1903 he wrote a biographical account of Murialdo and a novena to Saint Joseph for the order. In 1903 he met Pope Pius X in a private audience and the pope encouraged his work. He died in mid-1925 in the Artigianelli College in Turin; his remains were exhumed and relocated in 1965 to the Santuario di Nostra Signora della Salute in Turin. Beatification process The beatification process opened in the Turin archdiocese in 1971 despite the fact that the Congregation for the Causes of Saints did not title Reffo as a Servant of God and launch the cause until 24 February 1979 when it issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" edict (no objections to the cause). The process ended in 1981 and moved to Rome where the C.C.S. validated the process on 10 February 1995 before receiving the Positio dossier a decade later in 2006 for evaluation. Historians assessed and approved the cause on 24 October 2006 while nine theologians also issued their approval on 12 June 2012. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members later met and approved the cause on 3 June 2014. Reffo became titled as Venerable on 12 June 2014 after Pope Francis signed a decree acknowledging that Reffo had lived a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Murialdine priest Orides Ballardin.

Biography F√§rber (spelling changed in 1938) grew up in Leipzig as the son of a businessman and studied natural sciences (chemistry, physics, and mineralogy) in Leipzig with doctorate in 1916. He then became an assistant to Carl Neuberg at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Experimentelle Therapie in Berlin. Due to an eye ailment he was not drafted in World War I, but worked at a laboratory in 1917/18 in Budapest in the conversion of a fermentation factory into a factory for glycerol production used in the ammunition industry. After the war he became chief chemist and chemical research director of Deutsche Bergin A.G. and Holzhydrolyse A.G. at Mannheim-Rheinau and Heidelberg. In National Socialist Germany, he anticipated an unfavorable future and in 1938 immigrated with his family to the United States, where he again worked in the chemical industry and as a consultant. In 1943 he became head of chemical research at Timber Engineering Corp. in Washington, D.C. In 1957 he retired, but remained active as a consultant. He held 85 US patents and published about 50 papers as an industrial chemist. But he is known for his work on the history of chemistry. Already in Berlin he was interested in the history of chemistry. He was inspired by the book Die Geschichte der Chemie von den √§ltesten Zeiten bis our Gegenwart (1899) by Ernst von Meyer. In that book and in other books on the history of chemistry, Farber thought that there was insufficient social and economic context for the chemical developments. Thus he wrote his own book (funded by Neuberg) on the history of chemistry, which was published in 1921 by Springer. In 1929/30 he contributed five biographical sketches to the anthology of G√ºnther Bugge Das Buch der Gro√üen Chemiker (The book of the great chemists). In 1955/56 Farber was the director of the Historical Section of the American Chemical Society. In 1962 he became an adjunct professor at the American University in Washington, D.C. He was an advisor to the Smithsonian Institution. In 1964 he received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society.

Early life  Marshall was born in Leicester, England and grew up in Rutland and Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. He studied Media Production at Brooksby Melton College and the University of Lincoln.  Work  Marshall's creative process involves adding colour to black and white photographs using Photoshop. For images where the colors aren't known or for historical photographs he relies on research for accuracy and his best judgement. In a 2016 BBC interview, Marshall explained his motive behind photo colourisation. \\"People sadly don't take a lot of interest in a black and white photo, whereas if they see something that's turned into colour from 100 years ago, it generates a lot more interest\\". In 2016 the Irish Independent commissioned Marshall to colourise a series of photos from their archive taken during the Easter Rising. These were published in April 2017. Marshall's most notable projects have been those to mark centenaries of significant battles of the First world war including the Battle of the Somme and Battle of Passchendaele.< Marshall's work was published in Michael D. Carroll's 2017 book Retrographic: History's Most Exciting Images Transformed into Living Colour. The Daily Telegraph published Marshall's photo of suffragettes Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst on their front page on 6 February 2018 to illustrate 100 years since women won the right to vote. In April 2018, Marshall released a set of photos to mark 100 years since the formation of the Royal Air Force. To mark the centenary of the end of World War I, in 2018 Marshall released a series of 100 colourised photos. In January 2020 The Daily Telegraph published Marshall's colourised versions of John Thomson's 1877 photo series Street Life Victorian London. To mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and Holocaust Memorial Day, Marshall colourised a series of photos of Holocaust victims taken throughout 1945. For the 75th anniversary of VE Day Marshall was commissioned by the Daily Express to colourise a selection of photos showing celebrations in London and New York. In June 2020 Marshall released a series of photos showing the history of Black British people in Britain, including colourised photos of Walter Tull, Paul Stephenson and members of the Windrush generation.  Other activities  Marshall has a long standing interest in the British comic actor Will Hay and founded the Will Hay Appreciation Society in 2009. Marshall is a model maker and railway modeller. In September 2020 Marshall's model of 'Buggleskelly Station' from the Will Hay film 'Oh, Mr Porter!' appeared in Model Rail magazine.

Two months into his term, Van called for the phasing out of single-use plastics in Australia and highlighted his belief that the real solution to reducing pollutants would come when market efficiencies and consumers encourage the producer to innovate. Van has also played a role in bringing together a forum of Victorian Consul-Generals through regular diplomatic roundtables.

It won the Irish Time's Literature Prize for poetry, the Hawthornden Prize, and the T.S. Eliot Prize in 2000.  Content  The Weather in Japan is a collection of poems dealing with the malicious battles of the United States pre-civil war, WWI, and the Holocaust of WWII. He refers to the Odyssey many times in various poems throughout the book. Longley also refers to ancient warfare and it's violent as well contemporary battlefields. By placing the soldiers and their hardships into the form of poetry, Longley commits the memory of these men forever to the attention of all who read and re-read this book of poetry. He brings to light the Irish killing their neighbors due to the conflict of the dominance of the British-Protestant over the Catholic-Irish. The longest poem in the collection describes the battlefields and cemeteries of WWI.  Style  Poems in this collection vary widely in length and firm, and include single line poems as well as elegies and haiku, and various other formats. Many of the poems in this collection refer to images such as flowers and animals. Longley's aesthetic is reminiscent of a Japanese, Zen-like attitude. Like his other poetry, The Weather in Japan contains short lyrical poems, with an image, observation, or personal reflection. Two of the most used motifs throughout the book are flowers and the patchwork quilt. Another tactic in his writing is to tie his family ancestors to literary ones he has been influenced by.  Reception  According to Wesley McNair's review in the Colby Quarterly, this book of poetry strongly displays Longley's concern towards the cultural differences in his country‚ÄîIreland. In McNair's words, \\"For a writer who believes as Longley does in the value of multiculturalism in Irish society, the artist who creates by bringing together different resources is an important model, demonstrating in his work that by embracing diversity, new orders can be found.\\" In an article on Longley as a poet and the topic of war, M√ºmin Hakkioƒülu says that Longley \\"has a great affinity and affection for his predecessors\\".
