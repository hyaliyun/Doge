Larocque‚Äôs ‚ÄúYellowstone Journal‚Äù provides a picture of the early fur trade with the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians in North Dakota. As he traveled with a Crow Indian camp on its way back home to the Yellowstone, Larocque described the various countrysides from the Hidatsa village Big Hidatsa at Knife River, upstream Powder River and along the Bighorn Mountains. During the 2¬Ω months long journey, he and the Crows made camps in the modern states of North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. Probably, Larocque‚Äôs detailed record gives ‚Äúa better understanding of the day-to-day rhythm of camp movement and the factors conditioning this movement than any other known document ‚Ä¶‚Äù on a typical plains people.Ewers, John C.

It also adds to the history and ethnography of the Crows.Wood, Raymond W. and Thomas D. Thiessen (1987): Early Fur Trade On The Northern Plains. Canadian Traders Among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians, 1738‚Äì1818. Norman and London.  Fran√ßois-Antoine Larocque  Born in Quebec, Fran√ßois-Antoine Larocque (1784‚Äì1869) learned English in the United States from boyhood. His ‚ÄúYellowstone Journal‚Äù was most likely written in that language. The original is lost, but a copy is in the Baby Collection of the Archives Department, University of Montreal. In 1801, Larocque entered the Canadian fur trade. First employed at the XY Company, he worked for the North West Company at the time of his expedition. Charles Jean Baptiste Chaboillez was then in charge of the company‚Äôs Assiniboine River branch. Instead of waiting for some Indians to arrive with furs at Fort Montagne √† la Bosse in Manitoba, employees went on planned trading expeditions with goods to the distant village Indians on the Upper Missouri in North Dakota.  The start  Map with the route of a Crow Indian camp and Francois-Antoine Larocque in 1805. During the travel, they made camp in present-day North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana With orders from Chaboillez to examine the potentials of a future trade with the relatively unknown ‚ÄúRocky Mountains Indians‚Äù (the Crows), Larocque and some companions left Fort Montagne √† la Bosse in the summer of 1805. Larocque envisioned the hazards of the expedition and feared for his life. On June 12, the group arrived at the Native trading centerEwers, John C.

Pp. 14-33. formed by the corn growing village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandan Indians lived just south of the Hidatsas. The latter share a common origin with the Crows.Meyer, Roy W. (1977): The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London. Disliking opposition, most Hidatsas tried to scare Larocque from joining a trading Crow camp on its homeward journey by talks of Crow treachery. Unwavering and reassured by Hidatsa chief Le Borgne (One Eye), Larocque exchanged gifts of friendship with the Crow leaders on June 27. The head chief was Red Calf. Two days later, Larocque and his companions, William Morrison and a man with the surname of Souci, went to the Crow camp. The Indians ‚Äúthrew down their tents‚Äù and the entire group went eight miles up the Knife and made camp for the night. The Crows were retracing their steps loaded with 200 guns with balls and powder, lots of corn as well as axes, kettles and other items acquired from the Hidatsas for 250 horses, many buffalo robes and skin clothes.  The journey to Little Missouri River  The next days the camp, with 645 Crow warriors from different bands and joined by a Shoshone camp of 20 tipis, moved southwest heading for Heart River. Start was around 8 or 9 o‚Äôclock in the morning. Four or five hours later, the Indians made a new camp. The fur traders lived in the tipi of an attentive Crow family. After an attempt of theft of a gun, the camp chief arranged for two night guards outside the tipi. On July 2, a number of lodges collapsed in a shower of large hails. Crossing Heart River, the camp moved towards Little Missouri River. A false alarm of enemies stopped the advance of the camp once. Young men went hunting when possible. With buffalo close to the moving camp, guards checked the people until the hunters were off. A count of the firearms in camp showed 204 guns. One night, a hurricane threw down many of the more than 300 tipis in camp. On July 10, the camp dried meat and a deceased woman was laid to rest before a much later than usual camp movement in the afternoon. Three days later, the camp crossed the Little Missouri.  The journey to Powder River  Detail of Beaver Hut on the Missouri painted by Karl Bodmer. Larocque were ordered to the Yellowstone area to get first-hand knowledge of the number of beavers and to incite the local Crow Indians to hunt them The Indians killed some beavers on the way upstream the Little Missouri. They learned how to dress them to meet the standard of the fur company. On July 18, Larocque hunted buffalo with the camp chief, while the main body moved 15 miles upstream. The camp started westward, left the river and put up the tipis on a tributary. Larocque being sick, the camp remained at this place for two days. The tipis were finally pitched on the banks of the silt-filled Powder River on July 27. Larocque noted a rich wildlife in form of beaver, buffalo, elk, pronghorn and bear.  The journey to the Bighorn Mountains  Prickly pears had covered much of the ground between the Little Missouri and the Powder, so the camp stayed for a day to let the horses feed on grass. The women dried and dressed skins. Larocque went hunting with the Indians during a camp move and saw the first bighorns. He described a landscape of high hills. One had many ‚Äústones‚Äù (selenite gypsum) shining like mirrors. Due to a common buffalo hunt, the camp police halted even Larocque and the chief as they were about to leave the campsite one morning. However, they were permitted to leave unnoticed. The tipi of the chief was the first down in camp and the first up. He was in front of the moving people, except for advanced scouts. Rear guards protected the slow in the group. Larocque had now traveled with the Crows for more than a month. The Powder River in Johnson County, Wyoming. Larocque and the Crows followed Powder River upstream for many days The first of August came with thunder and rain. The weather thwarted every plan of a camp move. Powder River rose six inches. The already sandy and thick water became mud. While camping along the Powder, the Crows dug holes in the shore and used the filtered water there. An unseen enemy fired at some children a night. Guards were on the alert until morning. On August 4, Larocque finally studied the Bighorn Mountains through his spyglass. Except for Indians, only the free fur trader M√©nard had seen the range around 1800 for sure. The 1743 journal of the La V√©rendrye brothers‚Äô expedition is too vague to tell if they saw the Bighorn Mountains or just reached the Black Hills, South Dakota. A woman received a seriously shoot wound on August 6, inflicted by a man (not her husband) in jealousy. Impatiently, camp members asked Larocque, when he would return to the Hidatsa village. They had expected his goodbye, once he had seen the Bighorn Mountains. Larocque found it hard to make the Crows understand the reasons for his probe into the population of beaver, ‚Äúfor they do not want to understand‚Äù. On August 8, the longest expedition stage of 24 miles took the camp to the foot of the Bighorn Mountains. The men hunted buffalo for tipis. The leaders in camp sent out scouts to determine the best route to the Yellowstone. When asked again, Larocque said he would follow the camp for another 20 to 30 days. He wanted to see the River aux Roches Jaunes (the Yellowstone) and the homeland of the Crows, so he could return with trading items. Then, some Crows painted a rather detailed map of the country on a skin and showed where they usually made camps at different times of the year. The scouts returned on August 12 and brought news of large buffalo herds on Tongue River and Little Bighorn River. A camp crier announced the council‚Äôs decision of a camp movement along the range towards the Yellowstone the next day. Panorama of Buffalo, Wyoming at the base of the Bighorn Mountains. Before Larocque, the only white man known to have seen Bighorn Mountains was the free fur trader M√©nard around 1800. The La V√©rendrye brothers may only have seen the Black Hills, South Dakota, in 1743  The journey along the Bighorn Mountains  Indians hunting the bison by Karl Bodmer. Some times, Larocque hunted bison with the Crows People and horses were in danger of falling down steep hills during the first movement along the Bighorn Mountains. As always, the tipis were later pitched close to a stream. One day, Larocque bought a horse for a gun, 200 balls, clothes and blankets, some metal items and other stuff. Wild plum trees and bushes with berries grew everywhere and attracted the bears. Larocque saw nearly the whole camp engage in one of the daily bear hunts. On August 18, the moving camp paused for some hours to let the men hunt at Little Bighorn River. It crossed that river before selecting a place for the night. Confusion ruled in camp the next morning. The wife of the trail chief, Spotted Crow, had deserted him for a lover. He wanted to follow her, while other bandleaders favored the already chosen route. ‚ÄúHorses have been killed and women wounded‚Äù due to jealousy. A Shoshone in camp shot his wife dead, when he found her with another man for the third time. The shortest camp movement of only three miles brought the travelling Indians to a scenic spot with fine grass for the horse herds. The camp stayed a day, so the people could utilize the hard ash wood found just here. Nearly everyone carved horsewhip handles and other wooden objects. Spotted Crow stepped down as trail chief the following day. Another man of age replaced him and assured Larocque, they would continue to the Yellowstone as planned.  Enemies  Crow Indians. Larocque traveled with a Crow camp for more than two months during his Yellowstone journey. The discovery of a war group of Assiniboine Indians near Bighorn River stirred the Crow camp one morning. A general alarm stirred the camp the next morning, August 24. The sound of two shots had come from a place near Bighorn River, and the camp guards had noticed a few running buffalo. Further, they reported three unknown Indians on a hill near Bighorn Mountains. Thirty mounted warriors left camp right away, while other men prepared to follow if needed. Two or three hours later, a messenger came back with news of 35 foot warriors moving away along a tributary to the Bighorn. Except for the aged and the feeble, all in camp took up the pursued on horseback. Larocque followed. The large body of warriors, women and children assembled on a hill. A leader of one of the warrior societies took the lead with a group of men. Meanwhile, a crier encouraged and inspired the rest of the people. All were dressed up. Wives carried the arms of their husband and followed him. Scouts on distant hilltops signaled with skins which route to ride. Other leaders came up to the waiting crowd and all went after the foes. The Crows overtook two enemy scouts after a long pursued. They were identified as Assiniboine Indians. When Larocque arrived, both had been killed and scalped. The bodies were mutilated. A shocked Larocque saw the victors bring cut off trophies back to camp. That night and the next day, the camp celebrated the triumph over their enemies. Warriors with black painted face sang to the beat of a drum. Thirty women danced while they carried their husband‚Äôs weapons and displayed the two scalps. With intervals, the camp would do the victory dance three more times.  The journey to Yellowstone River  Rain delayed the camp movement until noon on August 26. Larocque noted many beaver dams near the new campsite. Scouts tried to locate the rest of the Assiniboine war party. Someone had found a clear trail of many peoples near the Bighorn River, and the camp feared a large-scale attack. Guards were up all night. Before daylight all prepared for a battle, which never occurred. The next day, hunters reported unknown Indians far away. The Crow tipis were pitched near the mouth of the Bighorn Canyon. On September 1, the camp made a short movement to the next site. A Shoshone arrived in camp with a bridle and other trade goods of Spanish make. The first signs of autumn appeared. With the tipis put up at ‚ÄúShot Stone River‚Äù (Pryor Creek), the hunters went for buffalo. (The Crows shot arrows into the high openings of Arrow Rock near the river as an offering and hence the name of this tributary to the Yellowstone.)Medicine Crow, Joseph (1992): From the Heart of the Crow Country. The Crow Indians' Own Stories. New York. The women dried buffalo tongues and dressed skins for an important but not specified ceremony. The noticed signs of strangers in the area proved to come from a big camp of Gros Ventre Indians (Atsina). They hoped to establish contact, but no one dared visit the Crow camp. The Crows and Larocque stood on the banks of the Yellowstone on September 10. They pitched the tipis on a large island in the river. The next day, five Gros Ventres entered the lodge of the camp chief, where Larocque now stayed. They wanted to trade for horses. The camp moved nine miles up the Yellowstone to a place, where the Crows used to make ‚Äútheir fall medicines‚Äù. (This may hint to the Sun Dance, although not a yearly ceremony among the Crows). Lowie, Robert H. (1983): The Crow Indians. Lincoln and London. The camp had accomplished 47 movements since the start on June 29.  The way back to Big Hidatsa village  Larocque and his fellow fur traders were ready to leave on September 14. He urged the Crows to hunt beavers. He promised to come back with goods next fall then. By the signal of four fires lit on a Pryor Mountains top on four successive days, he would announce his return to the Crow country. The Crows responded they usually spent the winter in a nearby mountain valley. The Yellowstone area was a favorite during spring and fall, while they camped near Tongue River and an unidentified ‚ÄúHorse River‚Äù in the summer. Two chiefs escorted the leaving party eight miles up the Yellowstone on the north bank. The men continued 20 miles. Next morning, they crossed to the other side of the river. They waded Pryor Creek at the confluence with the Yellowstone. They found a rock with a battle between three horsemen and three pedestrians painted in red. The area was alive with buffalo and elk. The party made camp at Tongue River on September 21. Two days later, it crossed the Powder. Unable to find any grass, the men had to give the horses bark of cottonwood. Once, they went through heavy smoke from a plains fire. It became necessary to shoe the horses with rawhide due to the constant travelling. Sometimes the men did more than 35 miles a day. They reached the Missouri on the last day of September. Larocque discovered a fortified earth lodge, likely made by either the Mandan or the Hidatsa. A corral adjoined the palisade. Inside he found many buffalo skulls, a number of them painted red. On October 9, the party reached a camp of Hidatsas a little upstream from their village. Since Larocque‚Äôs departure, some Sioux Indians had killed three Hidatsas. The men crossed the Missouri. Here they came across three Assiniboine couples heading for the Hidatsa villages to trade. Winter was approaching. The men reached Fort Montagne √† la Bosse on October 18. Larocque arrived with 122 beaver skins, four bear skins and two otter skins, a Crow bow of horn, a part of a tipi and a few other items.  About the Crows  Larocque shared some of his knowledge about his Crow hosts gained during the Yellowstone expedition. He noted three divisions of Crows split up into smaller bands and camps. Smallpox had cut their numbers from 2,000 tipis to 300 around 1802. When game was abundant, the Crows made big camps for common protection. The Crows obtained many horses from the Flathead Indians further west and exchanged them later with profit to the Mandans and the Hidatsas for kettles, guns and products of the garden. It was uncommon to see a Crow family with less than 10 horses and many had 30 or more. Due to the general wealth in horses, the Crows were able to transport cripples and people of old age from camp to camp, unlike some other Natives. Overall, Larocque considered the Crows a healthy people. The Crows enjoyed good company. Larocque commented on the proper ritual to perform before smoking a pipe and about the etiquette while smoking. He made a short list of words to show the similarities between the languages of the Crow and the related Hidatsa. He included some information obtained about the Flathead and the Shoshone Indians further west.  Later  Larocque was unable to keep his promise to the Crows the next year. He never returned to their homeland. The next whites passing through the heart of the Crow country were members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during the summer of 1806.Lewis, Meriwether and William Clark (1993): The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Written by Dana Horgan & Leah Fong, and directed by Ron Underwood, it premiered on ABC in the United States on May 4, 2018. In the episode, Henry's future and that of the residents of Hyperion Heights rests on finding the spell that will change everything as Gothel prepares to unleash a new wrath on the Land Without Magic, while Facilier's plan to use Sabine and Weaver are sidetracked by unforeseen circumstances. In the past, Henry faces a tough decision as he prepares to graduate from high school. Plot =Opening sequence= Regina's car is featured in the forest. =Event Chronology= *The Storybrooke events occur after ‚ÄúThe Final Battle‚Äù and \\"A Pirate's Life\\" and before the opening scene of ‚ÄúHyperion Heights‚Äù . *The Seattle events occur after ‚ÄúFlower Child‚Äù. =In the Characters' Past (the present day)= In Storybrooke, Regina has Henry line up against a wall to measure his growth. As he leaves for school, Regina gives him her car. However, he isn't sure about colleges at this point. Later on, Regina surprises Henry with a bunch of brochures from universities for him to consider. Weeks later, Regina discovers that Henry was accepted to every university, but Henry continues to have doubts about his future and isn't sure about what he wants. The flashback reveals a twist in the story: as Henry goes upstairs to try on his cap and gown, he gets a surprise phone call. When Henry answers it, it is the adult Henry on the other end. Adult Henry says he's a friend of young Henry's mother, and they have a brief conversation. Before ending the call, the adult Henry tells the young Henry where to find the box that was behind the dresser. When Henry does, it reveals a magic bean, which Henry will use on the day he leaves Storybrooke. Later that night, Henry finally tells Regina that he is ready to make a choice but will tell her the following morning. The final moments have Henry writing his book called \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and narrates the opening tales about him and his family. =In The Present Day= A dark storm cloud circulates around Seattle, and Lucy tells Regina that Facilier saved Henry from the curse, but it failed to ignite True Love's Kiss between him and Jacinda. The two are startled by Gothel, who offers Regina a chance to join her Coven and save her family as she tells them that Henry has lost his powers in believing. Regina turns her down. Later on, Weaver makes amends with Regina by offering a special potion to help Regina save Henry. He tells Regina he's doing this because of Belle. But when she gives Henry the potion at his apartment, it doesn't work. Regina and Lucy decide to use another approach, by using the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" book, but that doesn't work either. At this point, Henry still doesn't believe and wants Regina and Lucy to stop this nonsense. After Lucy leaves, an upset Regina keeps trying to make Henry believe. When he asks where are the heroes in the book such as Snow, Charming, and Emma, Regina reveals that the curse Gothel created sent everyone back in time and that their past selves have yet to leave Storybrooke (thus revealing that the Storybrooke flashbacks and the Hyperion Heights action are actually occurring alongside each other). After they return to Henry's apartment, and after Lucy tells him she has given up on him, Henry discovers the adoption papers with a phone number. He calls the number and speaks to his younger self, which causes Henry's memories to come back. Lucy is excited that Henry's back, and they go to rescue Regina. At the Coven, Rogers watches as one of the witches is transformed into a tree, while the power causes Tilly to fall into a trance. Rogers escapes. When he reaches the police station, Rogers confronts Weaver about Gothel and the witches, and Weaver tells him that everything he witnessed is true and that it will all make sense soon. The two then recruit Margot to help them. When they return, Margot tries to talk Tilly out of it but Tilly uses her magic to push her away, then shrinks Margot, Rogers, and Weaver down in size. They watch as the rest of the witches turn to trees. Earlier that day at Jacinda's, Lucy and Jacinda are packing for Bainbridge Island when Sabine gives Lucy a backpack that Drew used. When Lucy shows the two a tarot card and tells them about Facilier, the ladies decide to pay a visit to Samdi's office. Arriving there, Facilier shows them a tied-up Drew, then sticks a pin in a doll that caused Sabine pain. The women comply by joining him in the closet. That night at the garden, Regina tries to stop Gothel, but as Regina doesn't have magic, Gothel gets the upper hand. As Gothel prepares to destroy humanity, Henry and Lucy show up, and as Henry grabs Regina, he kissed her and breaks the Curse, saving humanity. The ending of the curse reunites Henry with Ella, Regina and Lucy, and Alice with a full- sized Weaver, Hook and Robin. The curse not only restores everyone and their magic, but it also gives Alice a chance to choose love over evil. She uses her magic to transform Gothel into a tree, and she places flowers around it. The curse also wakes up Ella and Tiana, but Facilier escapes before they can stop him. Sabine/Tiana and Drew/Naveen are also reunited. With Weaver's powers restored, the former Mr. Gold attempts to retrieve his and Belle's album book, but it is not in his safe. He then visits Facilier's office and discovers it there. When Facilier walks in, Weaver attempts to use his magic to choke Facilier but stops short of killing him. But then, Facilier is killed in front of Weaver by the Wish Realm Rumpelstiltskin, who wants to become better acquainted with Weaver.

The unity of the intellect is a philosophical theory proposed by the Muslim medieval Andalusian philosopher Averroes (1126‚Äì1198), which asserted that all humans share the same intellect. Averroes expounded his theory in his long commentary of On the Soul to explain how universal knowledge is possible within the Aristotelian theory of mind. Averroes's theory was influenced by related ideas by previous thinkers such as Aristotle, Plotinus, Al-Farabi, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Avempace (Ibn Bajja). When Averroes's works were translated into Latin, this theory was taken up and expanded by Averroists in Western Europe in the following centuries, such as Siger of Brabant, John of Jandun and John Baconthorpe. It also influenced the secularist political philosophy of Dante Alighieri in the fourteenth century. However, it was rejected by other philosophers‚Äîincluding Thomas Aquinas, who wrote a detailed critique‚Äîand received condemnation by Catholic Church authorities. In modern times, it is no longer seen as a tenable theory and historian of philosophy Peter Adamson comments that it is a product of Averroes's time. Background The idea of a single, universal intellect associated with all human knowledge had been proposed by philosophers before Averroes. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) proposes a \\"maker intellect\\" which enables thinking by making things intelligible, much like light allows seeing by making things visible. Plotinus (d. 270), whose works were well known in the Islamic world, proposed that human beings gained knowledge through their relation to a divine intellect. Muslim philosophers Al-Farabi (d. 951) and Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina, d. 1037) further develop this theory and call it the \\"agent intellect\\", which gives forms to matter and facilitates human knowledge. Avempace (also known as Ibn Bajja, d. 1138) proposed a theory of the intellect that was to influence Averroes's theory, but, according to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, his preserved works are so obscure and incomplete that scholars of philosophy do not know how well-developed his theory was. Averroes's idea is different from the previous theories because the other ones hold that the universal intellect is superhuman and that each human individual has its own intellect, while Averroes identifies the single intellect with the mind of all humans. While Averroes propounds his general ideas on human intellect in all of his three commentaries on Aristotle's On the Soul, this theory only appears in his final long commentary. He provides different theses for explaining human knowledge in his previous two commentaries, suggesting that the notion of unity of the intellect is his most mature theory after having considered other ideas. Theory = Averroes's original thesis= Averroes argues, as put by the historian of philosophy Peter Adamson, that \\"there is only one, single human capacity for human knowledge\\". He calls it‚Äîusing contemporary terminology‚Äîthe \\"material intellect\\", which is one and the same for all human beings. The intellect is eternal and continuously thinking about all that can be thought. It uses faculties (e.g. the brain) of individual humans as a basis for its thinking process. The process that happens in the human brain is called fikr by Averroes (known as cogitatio in Latin, often translated to \\"cogitation\\" in English), a process which contains not universal knowledge but \\"active consideration of particular things\\" that the person has encountered. This use of human faculty explains why thinking can be an individual experience: if at one point the universal intellect is using one's brain to think about an object of thought, then that person is also experiencing the thinking. For Averroes, this explains how universal knowledge is possible: it is because there is a universal capacity for knowledge. He also uses it to interpret passages in Aristotle's On the Soul, and this exegetical value is seen as the theory's strong point by Averroes and the theory's later proponents. = By Latin Averroists = Starting from the thirteenth century, Western European writers translated Averroes's works into Latin, generating a circle of followers known as the Latin Averroists. The Latin Averroists took up, among other Averroes's ideas, the theory of the unity of the intellect, and elaborated it. Siger of Brabant argues that this unique intellect is associated with the human body in an \\"operational union\\" only. John of Jandun says that the intellect operates within the body and is united to it thanks to the phantasmata. Another Averroist, John Baconthorpe proposed that there is an ontological and an epistemological aspect of the union between the unique intellect and the body, developing a theory that is called the \\"double conjunction\\" (Latin: copulatio bifaria) theory. He argues that thanks to the ontological conjunction, the intellect becomes a human faculty. Reaction = Reception = The unity of the intellect was one of the inspirations for Dante Alighieri (pictured) political philosophy treatise De Monarchia. While Averroes's works have very limited influence in the Islamic world, the Latin translation of his works enjoyed a wide audience in Western Europe. The unity of the intellect thesis, in particular, generated an intellectual controversy in Latin Christendom. Many, especially the Averroists, saw appeal in the theory because it explained universal knowledge and justified Aristotle's idea of the intellective soul. The Latin Averroists who supported this theory often elaborated it further and tried to resolve questions that Averroes did not tackle in his original work (see above). The Italian poet Dante Alighieri (c. 1265 ‚Äì 1321) used Averroes's theory as a basis for his secularist political philosophy in the treatise De Monarchia. He argued that given that all mankind shares one intellect, men should be politically united to achieve their highest goals, universal peace and happiness on earth. = Criticisms = Thomas Aquinas, who wrote a detailed treatise attacking the unity of the intellect thesis. Other thinkers, however, were opposed to the theory. Many scholastic thinkers, including the Italian Thomas Aquinas criticized it for not being able to explain how humans can think individually, and how this single intellect is associated with human body. They also criticized the thesis from the theological standpoint. If there is only one eternal soul, and individualized thinking only happens through a lower faculty which will perish with the body when a person dies, then the theory fails to provide for a person's immortality and afterlife. Thomas Aquinas wrote a treatise De Unitate Intellectus, Contra Averroistas (\\"On the Unity of the Intellect, against the Averroists\\"), which contained detailed arguments to reject this theory. He used the philosophical and theological oppositions mentioned above, and used his own reading of Aristotle to show that Averroes misinterpreted what Aristotle said. Catholic Church authorities condemned the theory, along with other ideas of Averroes, in 1270 and 1277 (by Bishop √âtienne Tempier of Paris) and again in 1489 in Padua by local bishops. Modern evaluation Present-day historian of philosophy Peter Adamson says that the theory seems \\"obviously false\\" from the modern point of view and may appear \\"crazy\\" to a modern audience. However, he also points out that in Averroes's time, it was a reasonable interpretation of Aristotle's ideas, though not necessarily accepted by other contemporary philosophers. According to Adamson, modern criticisms can be levied at the theory, for example by questioning the idea of \\"universal knowledge\\" that this theory attempts to explain. Just because a fact (such as \\"frogs are amphibians\\") is universal does not mean that the act of thinking about it has to be universal. If the act of thinking about it is not universal, there is no need to explain the phenomenon using a single, universal intellect. However, while this counterargument may seem very obvious today, it does not make sense within the Aristotelian theory of mind under which Averroes was operating.

Marcos raped and murdered five women between April 17, 2009 and February 26, 2010, when he was detained by Minas Gerais Civil Police in the Lindeia neighbourhood, near the industrial district in Contagem. Police officers discovered that he tracked down the victims' cell phones, with Marcos himself confessing to the murders after his arrest. Delegate Edson Moreira, one of those responsible for the case, announced on February 26 that at least three women were able to escape the maniac. On February 2, 2010, police had disclosed that there was a common behavioural pattern in all the murders, and that an expert found semen in the three 2009 victims which was from the same perpetrator. The case recalls another similar murder spree in Belo Horizonte between 1999 and 2001, when twelve women were found raped and killed in Greater Belo Horizonte, called the UFMG Maniac or the Maniac da Pampulha, who was never apprehended.  Biography  Marcos Antunes Trigueiro was born in Bras√≠lia de Minas, Minas Gerais, but spent a part of his life in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but always returned to Minas Gerais. Marcos has been married at least twice and is the father of five children.

The spacecraft and its Juno II launch vehicle were destroyed five seconds after launch on July 16, 1959, in a spectacular launch failure caused by complications with the rocket's power supply. A relaunch of the mission in October 1959, Explorer 7 (S-1A), was successful. Mission The S-1 mission was planned to be the sixth flight of the Explorers program, designated Explorer S-1, and Explorer 7X retrospectively. The objectives of the mission were to measure the Earth's radiation balance, and the abundance of Lyman-alpha x-rays and cosmic rays, including heavy primary cosmic rays. The spacecraft was also designed as a test bed for satellite capabilities, being equipped with instruments to measure the spacecraft's temperature, micrometeorite impacts, and the erosion of solar cells exposed to the vacuum of space. The spin-stabilized spacecraft was in size, and had a launch mass of . The spacecraft's power was drawn from a bank of fifteen nickel‚Äìcadmium batteries recharged by 3,000 solar cells mounted on the exterior of the spacecraft. Launch The S-1 spacecraft was mounted atop a Juno II launch vehicle with the serial AM-16. It was launched on July 16, 1959, at 16:37 UTC, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5. Immediately after liftoff, a short circuit of the rocket's guidance system caused the Rocketdyne S-3D engines to gimbal, tilting the rocket sharply to the west before almost flipping upside down. Five-and-a-half seconds after launch, the Range Safety Officer destroyed the rocket. The rocket's payload impacted the ground northwest of the launch site, resulting in a massive fireball. Aftermath In an investigation conducted after the launch failure, it was found that the short circuit occurred between two diodes in the rocket's power supply inverter voltage regulator, cutting off power to the guidance system and causing a full gimbal. Circuit board designs for the Juno II, and similar rockets, subsequently used conformal coating to reduce the chances for a recurrence. The launch, described by commentators as \\"infamous\\" and \\"one of the most spectacular failures ever seen at [Cape Canaveral]\\", was the third of the Juno II rocket, after it failed to carry Pioneer 3 into heliocentric orbit in December 1958, but succeeded in the same objective in March 1959, carrying the United States' first interplanetary mission, Pioneer 4. S-1 was the first geocentric orbit launch attempt for the rocket; its second attempt on August 14, 1959, carrying the Beacon 2 inflatable sphere experiment to low Earth orbit, also failed. Eventually, both the Juno II and a re-launch of the S-1 mission, designated Explorer 7 or S-1A, found success on October 13, 1959. The satellite, which ended its mission in August 1961, is still orbiting the Earth today.

Biography  He was born on 8 April 1908 in Kazan and was a son of General Nikolay Ivanovich Genishta. After graduating in 1929 from Moscow Technical School of Communications, he was sent to work at \\"Mosetletrik\\" plant, where he began his professional career. He was not allowed to get higher education because of his ancestry. A year later he became an engineer at a radio laboratory and participated in the development of a broadcast radio receiver. The receivers of the series had been produced in large numbers since 1932. In 1933‚Äï1934, Genistha developed a radio-based radio receiver BI-234. In 1936, it began to be produced at the Voronezh factory \\"Electrosignal\\" in large quantities and was popular with radio listeners. In 1935, the Institute of Communications and Moscow Power Engineering Institute invited Evgeni Genishta to read the course of Design and Calculation of Receiving Devices, the lecture summary of which was published in 1937 by Moscow Power Engineering Institute as a university textbook, which in 1939 was reissued by Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communications Engineers. In the prewar and war years, Evgeni Nikolayevich was engaged in the creation of radio equipment for Soviet ground forces and aviation. In particular, he created field radio stations: RB and later modernized RBM and radio station 13-R. In 1943-1945 he developed radar instruments: an airborne radio altimeter and a device for identification friend or foe. After World War II, in 1946, he created \\"Rodina\\" radio. In 1946-1947 under his guidance was developed first serial TV in USSR, 625-line standard \\"Moskvich T-1\\". After that he again switched to military research. He developed radio engineering units for missiles and aerial bombs for USSR nuclear shield. In 1963, he was moved to the Research Institute of Radio Engineering, where he headed the newly formed direction for the creation of radar homing heads for guided air-to-air missiles.

He was an acknowledged master in classical music, musical theater, blues, folk music, jazz, and popular music. He composed many songs for many well-known Iranian singers including Hayedeh, Googoosh, Mahasti, Dariush, Sattar, Ebi, Leila Forouhar and many others.  Early Life  Naser was born on the last of 1950 in Ardabil. His father taught him the basics of traditional Persian music during his childhood when he picked accordion as his very first instrument to begin his musical life.  Career  At the age of 12, Naser and his father both joined the Azerbaijan Orchestra at Radio Iran. He soon showed his musical talent and earned his first award for playing accordion as a junior high school student. He conducted an orchestra at the Iranian Embassy in Iraq when he was only 17. Just one year later, he started his professional career by going on tour with Googoosh. At age 20, he took an elementary course on jazz music in the United States. When returned home, he became the orchestra conductor of Parviz Gharib Afshar Show. The young Naser also served great masters like Morteza Hannaneh and √ämmanow√™l Melik'-Aslanean. In 1978, he again took a five-year course on jazz plus film score in the United States. Therefore, he became a pioneer in introducing electronic musical instruments into the musical scene of Iran. Cheshmazar's first step in his long path of film score was his collaboration in a movie called Taraj directed by Iraj Ghaderi. He is best known for his great album \\"Rain of Love\\", which is gracefully inspired by the laments of mothers of those Iranian soldiers who lost their lives in the Iran-Iraq War.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as Nationally Vulnerable by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1917 and named Xanthorhoe nebulosa. Philpott used specimens collected in February and March at The Bluff, Clarence River and at Coverham, Marlborough by Dr. J. A. Thomson and Hugh Hamilton. George Vernon Hudson described and illustrated the species in 1928. In 1987 Robin C. Craw placed this species within the genus Gingidiobora. The type specimen is held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Description The larvae are green and smooth. Philpott described the adults of the species as follows: Distribution G. nebulosa is endemic to New Zealand. As well as its type locality of Coverham and The Bluff, Clarence River, this species has been found at the Tone River bed and at Ka Whata Tu o Rakihouia Conservation Park in Marlborough. It is also present at Macraes Ponds in Waitaki, and in Otago. Biology and life cycle The larvae feed at night. The species is most commonly seen in March. Host plant The larvae of G. nebulosa feed on mountain carrot, Gingidia montana. This plant suffers from browse reduction which in turn affects the moth population. Conservation status This species has the \\"Nationally Vulnerable\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

The White Army captured the entire Northern Caucasus. The Red Army withdrew to Astrahan and the Volga delta.  Prelude  In summer and autumn 1918, the Red Army had been defeated in the Second Kuban Campaign and Ekaterinodar, Novorossiysk, Maykop, Armavir and Stavropol were lost. Red Army commander Ivan Sorokin rebelled against the Revolutionary Military Council of the North Caucasus, shot several of its members and fled, but was arrested and shot without trial by a regiment commander of the Taman army. After the loss of Stavropol on November 15, 1918, the forces of the Taman Army and the former Sorokin's army were consolidated into the 11th Red Army, which held the Zavetnoye- Petrovskoye-Remontnoye-Priyutnoye-Dry Buivola-Oak-Kursavka-Vorovskolesskaya- Kislovodsk-Nalchik front line, which roughly ran north‚Äìsouth. It was joined by the weak 12th Red Army which held the front line from Grozny over Kizlyar to the Terechnoye station, which ran west‚Äìeast. On December 8, 1918, both of these armies became part of a separate Caspian-Caucasian Front under command of Mikhail Svechnikov. The Front headquarters were located in Astrakhan, which wasn't ideal, as there were 400 km of desert between the front and the headquarters.  The campaign  On December 19, 1918, the Caspian-Caucasian Front received orders from Moscow to attack. The 11th Army was to launch an offensive against the Armavir -Tikhoretsk line held by the White troops of Denikin, while the 12th Army was to attack the Makhachkala - Derbent line with the support of the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla. The attack was launched on January 2, 1919, but the troops of the 11th Army were not able to carry out the assigned tasks, as they were opposed by considerable enemy forces. Its right-flank 4th division, after receiving a strong blow from the enemy near the Blagodarny station, broke away from the main force and withdrew, partly to Elista, and partly to Yashkul. When two brigades of the 3rd Infantry Division also withdrew in divergent directions, the White Army was able to transform the initial success of its counterattack into a general defeat of the 11th Army. Kislovodsk and Piatigorsk were taken on January 20, Grozny on February 5 and Vladikavkaz on February 10.Jonathan Smele, The \\"Russian\\" Civil Wars, 1916-1926: Ten Years that Shook the World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015; pg. 120. The 12th Army was also forced to conduct defensive battles in the districts of Kizlyar and west of Guryev. The defeat of the 11th Army made the 12th Army retreated towards the region of Astrakhan. The Red Army, already badly organized and poorly disciplined, had also been decimated by a typhus epidemic. General Avtonomov was one of its victims. General Wrangel was also infected, but survived. On February 4, 1919, the Stavropol Front was created to defend Astrakhan. In February 1919, the troops of the Front managed to secure Astrakhan and the mouth of the Volga and to prevent the union of Denikin's troops with the Ural white Cossacks. In March, the Caucasian-Caspian Front of the Red Army was disbanded, and the 11th and 12th Armies were consolidated into one, the 11th Army (second formation).

Martinus was the son of Emperor Heraclius and Empress Martina. Under Heraclius, Martinus was elevated to caesar in 638. Heraclius left the Byzantine Empire to two of Martinus' brothers, Constantine III and Heraklonas; Constantine soon died of tuberculosis, though some of his partisans alleged that he was poisined by Martina. One such partisan, Valentinus, led troops to Chalcedon to force Martina to make Constans II, the son of Constantine, co-emperor. Valentinus seized Constantinople regardless in September/October 641, and deposed Martina, Heraklonas, and Martinus, and cut off Martinus nose and emasculated him, before exiling him to Rhodes. History left Martinus was born to Byzantine Emperor Heraclius and Empress Martina at an unknown date. Martinus was declared a nobilissimus under Heraclius, while the elder brother Tiberius was made caesar on 4 July 638. According to the Byzantine historian Nicephorus Gregoras, Martinus was also made caesar on the same day, however the later historian and Emperor Constantine VII mentions only Tiberius. A partially preserved papyrus letter known as SB VI 8986, and CPR XXIII 35, shows that Martinus was definitely promoted to caesar at some point between 639 and 640, although the exact dating is debated: the German papyrologist who restored SB VI 8986, , and the Byzantine historian Nicolas Gonis argue for a date range between October 639 and September 640, whereas Byzantine scholar Constantin Zuckerman argues for a range between 4 January 639 and 8 November 639. According to John of Nikiu, Martinus and his brother David were involved in the banishment of Pyrrhus of Constantinople () to the Exarchate of Africa. This could be seen as a reaction to Pyrrhos bypassing David and Martinus after the death of Heraclius. However, the two princes were too young at the time to have taken an active role in any banishment and the account by John of Nikiu is so contradictory that no safe conclusions can be drawn from it. =Reign of Constantine III and Heraklonas= When Heraclius died on 11 February 641, he declared in his will that Constantine III and Heraklonas would co-rule the empire under the regency of Martina. The Byzantine Senate accepted Constantine III and Heraklonas as co-emperors, but rejected Martina as regent. On 20/24 April or 26 May 641, Constantine died of an advanced case of tuberculosis, although some supporters of Constantine alleged that Martina had him poisoned, leaving Heraklonas as the sole ruler under the regency of Martina. In August 641, Valentinus, a general who had been loyal to Constantine before his death, led his troops to Chalcedon to force Martina to elevate Constans II to co-emperor. A mob rose up in the city, demanding that Patriarch Pyrrhus must crown Constans II as emperor, and then abdicate, to be replaced by his steward Paul II (), who would come to replace him as Patriarch under Constans II. Martina, now in a truly desperate situation, offered the military further donatives, recalled an influential patron of Valentinus, Philagrius, from his exile in Africa, and offered Valentinus the title of Count of the Excubitors. =Valentius' revolt and Martinus' death= In late September/October, Martina elevated Constans to co-emperor, but also raised Heraklonas brother Tiberius to co-emperors alongside them. Despite these offers, Valentinus entered the city shortly thereafter, deposed Heraklonas and Martina, and then elevated Constans to emperor. Heraklonas, Martina, Tiberius, and Martinus are said by John of Nikiu to have been \\"escorted forth with insolence\\", where following, Valentinus had Martinus nose cut off, emasculated him and then banished him to Rhodes, where he stayed until his death. Another son, Theodosius, suffered no punishment as he was deaf-mute, and thus was not in a position to threaten the throne.

In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV was established.In addition to other subsidiaries pertaining to security and space activities, EADS owned 100% of the pre- existing Eurocopter SA, established in 1992, as well as 80% of Airbus Industrie GIE. In 2001, Airbus Industrie GIE was reorganised as Airbus SAS, a simplified joint-stock company. In 2006, EADS acquired BAE Systems' remaining 20% of Airbus. EADS NV was renamed Airbus Group NV and SE in 2014, and 2015, respectively.\\"EADS changes name to Airbus\\" . Financial Times, 2014.Frankfurt Stock Exchange Due to the dominance of the Airbus SAS division within Airbus Group SE, these parent and subsidiary companies were merged in January 2017, keeping the name of the parent company. The company was given its present name in April 2017. Origins Airbus Industrie began as a consortium of European aviation firms formed to compete with American companies such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed. While many European aircraft were innovative, even the most successful had small production runs. Factors favouring American aircraft manufacturers included: the size of the United States which made air transport popular; a 1942 Anglo-American agreement entrusting transport aircraft production to the US; and the World War II legacy of \\"a profitable, vigorous, powerful and structured aeronautical industry\\" in America. By the mid-1960s, several European aircraft manufacturers had drawn up competitive designs, but were aware of the risks of such a project. For example, in 1959 Hawker Siddeley had advertised an \\"Airbus\\" version of the Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy, which would \\"be able to lift as many as 126 passengers on ultra short routes at a direct operating cost of 2d. per seat mile.\\"\\"Flying Without Frills\\", Hawker Siddeley Aviation, The Times, Friday, 13 Feb 1959; pg. 5 The European industry began to accept, along with their governments, that collaboration was required to develop such an aircraft and to compete with the more powerful US manufacturers. Negotiations began over a European collaborative approach and at the 1965 Paris Air Show the major European airlines informally discussed their requirements for a new \\"Airbus\\" capable of transporting 100 or more passengers over short to medium distances at a low cost. The same year Hawker Siddeley (at the urging of the UK government) teamed with Breguet and Nord to study Airbus designs. The Hawker Siddeley/Breguet/Nord group's HBN 100 became the basis for the continuation of the project. By 1966 the partners were Sud Aviation, later A√©rospatiale (France), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Airbus, later Deutsche Airbus (West Germany) and Hawker Siddeley (UK). A request for funding was made to the three governments in October 1966. On 25 July 1967, the three governments agreed to proceed with the proposal. In the two years following this agreement, both the British and French governments expressed doubts about the project. The memorandum of understanding had stated that 75 orders must be achieved by 31 July 1968. The French government threatened to withdraw from the project due to its concern over funding all of the Airbus A300, Concorde and the Dassault Mercure concurrently, but was persuaded by Ziegler to maintain its support. With its own concerns at the A300B proposal in December 1968, and fearing it would not recoup its investment due to lack of sales, the British government withdrew on 10 April 1969. West Germany took this opportunity to increase its share of the project to 50%. Given the participation by Hawker Siddeley up to that point, France and West Germany were reluctant to take over its wing design. Thus the British company was allowed to continue as a privileged subcontractor. Hawker Siddeley invested GB¬£35 million in tooling and, requiring more capital, received a GB¬£35 million loan from the West German government. Formation of Airbus Industrie GIE Airbus Industrie was formally established as a Groupement d'Int√©r√™t √âconomique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970. It had been formed by a government initiative between France, West Germany and the UK that originated in 1967. Its initial shareholders were the French company A√©rospatiale and the West German company Deutsche Airbus, each owning a 50% share. The name \\"Airbus\\" was taken from a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s to refer to a commercial aircraft of a certain size and range, as it was linguistically-acceptable to the French. A√©rospatiale and Deutsche Airbus each took a 36.5% share of production work, Hawker Siddeley 20% and the Dutch company Fokker-VFW 7%. Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items. In October 1971 the Spanish company CASA acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, with A√©rospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their total stakes to 47.9%. In January 1979 British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, acquired a 20% share of Airbus Industrie. The majority shareholders reduced their shares to 37.9%, while CASA retained its 4.2%. =Development of the Airbus A300= Airbus A300, the first aircraft launched by Airbus, introduced in 1974. The Airbus A300 was to be the first aircraft to be developed, manufactured and marketed by Airbus. By early 1967 the \\"A300\\" label began to be applied to a proposed 320 seat, twin engined airliner. Following the 1967 tri-government agreement, Roger B√©teille was appointed technical director of the A300 development project. B√©teille developed a division of labour that would be the basis of Airbus' production for years to come: France would manufacture the cockpit, flight control and the lower centre section of the fuselage; Hawker Siddeley, whose Trident technology had impressed him, was to manufacture the wings; West Germany should make the forward and rear fuselage sections, as well as the upper centre section; the Dutch would make the flaps and spoilers; finally Spain (yet to become a full partner) would make the horizontal tailplane. On 26 September 1967 the West German, French and British governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding in London which allowed continued development studies. This also confirmed Sud Aviation as the \\"lead company\\", that France and the UK would each have a 37.5% work share with West Germany taking 25%, and that Rolls-Royce would manufacture the engines. The first North American customer was Eastern Air Lines with this Airbus A300B4 In the face of lukewarm support from airlines for a 300+ seat Airbus A300, the partners submitted the A250 proposal, later becoming the A300B, a 250-seat airliner powered by pre-existing engines. This dramatically reduced development costs, as the Rolls-Royce RB207 to be used in the A300 represented a large proportion of the costs. The RB207 had also suffered difficulties and delays, since Rolls-Royce was concentrating its efforts on the development of another jet engine, the RB211, for the Lockheed L-1011 and Rolls-Royce entering into administration due to bankruptcy in 1971. The A300B was smaller but lighter and more economical than its three-engined American rivals. In 1972, the A300 made its maiden flight; its first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974. However, the launch of the A300 was largely overshadowed by the similarly timed supersonic aircraft Concorde. Initially the success of the consortium was poor, but orders for the aircraft picked up, due in part to the marketing skills used by Airbus CEO Bernard Lathi√®re, targeting airlines in America and Asia. By 1979 the consortium had 256 orders for A300, and Airbus had launched a more advanced aircraft, the A310, in the previous year. It was the launch of the A320 in 1987 that guaranteed the status of Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market ‚Äì the aircraft had over 400 orders before it first flew, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972. Airbus A320, the first model in the A318, A319, A320 and A321 family, introduced in 1988 Formation of Eurocopter SA The Eurocopter SA was formed in 1992, through the merger of the helicopter divisions of A√©rospatiale and DASA. The company's heritage traces back to Bl√©riot and Lior√© et Olivier in France and to Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf in Germany.Airbus Helicopters history Formation of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV =Background= In June 1997, British Aerospace Defence Managing Director John Weston commented \\"Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.\\" European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company. As early as 1995 the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) and its British counterpart British Aerospace were said to be eager to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. The two companies envisaged including the French company A√©rospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation. The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, A√©rospatiale and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA into an integrated company; in this aim BAe and DASA were united against the various objections of A√©rospatiale. As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that A√©rospatiale was to merge with Matra and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO J√ºrgen Schrempp in December 1998. However, when the British General Electric Company put its defence electronics business Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. (The merger of British Aerospace and MES to form BAE Systems was announced on 19 January 1999 and completed on 30 November;BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000). Retrieved on 2006-10-27. Evans stated in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA). =Formation of EADS and expansion (1999‚Äì2008)= DASA and the Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA agreed to merge, signing a memorandum of understanding on 11 June 1999. On 14 October 1999, DASA agreed to merge with A√©rospatiale-Matra to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company. 10 July 2000 was \\"day one\\" for the new company, which became the world's second-largest aerospace company after Boeing and the second-largest European arms manufacturer after BAE Systems. In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company, with legal and tax procedures being finalised on 11 July. Both EADS and BAE transferred ownership of their Airbus factories to the new Airbus SAS in return for 80% and 20% shares in the new company respectively. In April 2001, EADS agreed to merge its missile businesses with those of BAE Systems and Alenia Marconi Systems (BAE/Finmeccanica) to form MBDA. EADS took a 37.5 % share of the new company that was formally established in December 2001 and which thus became the world's second-largest missile manufacturer. On 16 June 2003 EADS acquired BAE's 25 % share in Astrium, the satellite and space system manufacturer, to become the sole owner. EADS paid ¬£84 million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company BAE invested an equal amount for \\"restructuring\\". It was subsequently renamed EADS Astrium, and had the divisions Astrium Satellites, Astrium Space Transportation and Astrium Services. In November 2003, EADS announced that it was considering working with Japanese companies, and the Japanese METI, to develop a hypersonic airliner intended to be a larger, faster, and quieter, replacement for the Concorde, which was retired in October the same year. Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE Systems wished to sell its 20 % share of Airbus, the possibility was consistently denied by the company. However, on 6 April 2006 BBC News reported that it was indeed to sell its stake, then \\"conservatively valued\\" at ¬£2.4 billion. Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations, BAE exercised its put option, which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation. Six days after this process began, Airbus announced delays to the A380 with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares. On 2 June 2006 Rothschild valued BAE's share at ¬£1.87 billion, well below BAE's, analysts' and even EADS' expectations. The BAE board recommended that the company proceed with the sale and on 4 October 2006 shareholders voted in favour; the sale was completed on 13 October making EADS the sole shareholder of Airbus. In March 2007, EADS Defence and Security Systems division was awarded an eight-year, ¬£200m contract to provide the IT infrastructure for the FiReControl project in the UK.Dept for Communities & Local Govt: Award of state of the art IT contract to improve fire service delivery 7 March 2007, (accessed 9 March 2007) =Transition from Airbus Industrie GIE to Airbus SAS= Airbus A340 300 introduced in 1993 Airbus A330 introduced in 1994 The retention of production and engineering assets by the partner companies in effect made Airbus Industrie a sales and marketing company. This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies. It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement; it had become a long-term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s, work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.Frawley, Gerald. \\"Airbus A330-200\\". \\"Airbus A330-300\\". The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003/2004. Aerospace Publications, 2003. . In the early 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson argued that the GIE should be abandoned and Airbus established as a conventional company. However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, A√©rospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split. However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems. Then in 2000, three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; A√©rospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process. EADS now owned Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus Espa√±a, and thus 80% of Airbus Industrie. BAE Systems and EADS transferred their production assets to the new company, Airbus SAS, in return for shareholdings in that company. =Development of the A380= ImageSize = width:275 height:210 PlotArea = left:50 right:0 bottom:10 top:10 DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:1991 till:2007 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1991 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:5 start:1992 PlotData= Color:yellow mark:(line,black) align:left fontsize:M shift:(0,-3) # shift text to right side of bar # there is no automatic collision detection, fontsize:XS # so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap shift:(25,-10) at:2007 shift:15,-6 text: Airbus delivers first A380-800 at:2006 shift:15,-6 text: Certification and delays at:2005 shift:15,-6 text: Maiden flight at:2004 shift:15,-6 text: First engine delivered at:2002 shift:15,-6 text: Component-manufacturing starts at:2001 shift:15,-6 text: Airbus consortium is merged at:2000 shift:15,-6 text: Commercial launch of A3XX at:1996 shift:15,-6 text: Large Aircraft Division formed at:1993 shift:15,-6 text: Boeing cancels similar project at:1991 shift:15,-6 text: Market demand researched Airbus A380, the largest passenger jet in the world, introduced in 2007. In mid-1988 a group of Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began working in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747.Norris, 2005. p. 7. The project was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Air Show, with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the 747‚Äì400.Norris, 2005. p. 16-17. Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (A√©rospatiale, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. In June 1994 Airbus began developing its own very large airliner, then designated as A3XX. Airbus considered several designs, including an odd side-by-side combination of two fuselages from the Airbus A340, which was Airbus's largest jet at the time. Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747‚Äì400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design. Five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes. The first A380 was unveiled at a ceremony in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, and its maiden flight took place on 27 April 2005. After successfully landing three hours and 54 minutes later, chief test pilot Jacques Rosay said flying the A380 had been \\"like handling a bicycle\\". On 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0.96. On 10 January 2006, the A380 made its first transatlantic flight to Medell√≠n in Colombia. The Airbus A380 was delayed in October 2006 due to the use of incompatible software used to design the aircraft. Primarily, the Toulouse assembly plant used the latest version 5 of CATIA (made by Dassault), while the design centre at the Hamburg factory were using the older and incompatible version 4. The result was that the 530 km of cables wiring throughout the aircraft had to be completely redesigned. Although no orders had been cancelled, Airbus still had to pay millions in late-delivery penalties. The first aircraft delivered was to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with an inaugural flight between Singapore and Sydney. Two months later Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng said that the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's existing 747-400 fleet. Emirates was the second airline to take delivery of the A380 on 28 July 2008 and started flights between Dubai and New York on 1 August 2008. Qantas followed on 19 September 2008, starting flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles on 20 October 2008. =Expansion and sale of BAE stake= In 2003, Airbus and the Kaskol Group created an Airbus Engineering centre in Russia, which started with 30 engineers and since has emerged as a model of success for Airbus‚Äô globalisation strategy. It was the first engineering facility to open in Europe outside the company's home countries. Equipped with state-of-the-art communications equipment and linked with Airbus engineering sites in France and Germany, the facility performs extensive work in disciplines such as fuselage structure, stress, system installation and design. In 2011, the centre employs some 200 engineers who have completed over 30 large-scale projects for the A320, the A330/A340 and the A380 programmes. Russian engineers also performed more than half of all design work on the A330-200F freighter, with its activity related to fuselage structure design, floor grids installation and junctions design. The centre currently is involved in the A320neo Sharklets design development and numerous design works for the A350 XWB programme. On 6 April 2006 BAE Systems planned to sell its 20% share in Airbus, then \\"conservatively valued\\" at ‚Ç¨3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion). Analysts suggested the move to make partnerships with U.S. firms more feasible, in both financial and political terms. BAE originally sought to agree on a price with EADS through an informal process. Due to lengthy negotiations and disagreements over price, BAE exercised its put option, which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation. In June 2006 Airbus was embroiled in significant international controversy over an announcement of further delays in the delivery of its A380. Following the announcement the value of associated stock plunged by up to 25% in a matter of days, although it soon recovered afterwards. Allegations of insider trading on the part of No√´l Forgeard, CEO of EADS, its majority corporate parent, promptly followed. The loss of associated value was of grave concern to BAE, press described a \\"furious row\\" between BAE and EADS, with BAE believing the announcement was designed to depress the value of its share. A French shareholder group filed a class action lawsuit against EADS for failing to inform investors of the financial implications of the A380 delays while airlines awaiting deliveries demanded compensation. As a result, EADS chief No√´l Forgeard and Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert resigned on 2 July 2006. On 2 July 2006 Rothschild valued BAE's stake at ¬£1.9 billion (‚Ç¨2.75 billion), well below the expectation of BAE, analysts, and even EADS. On 5 July BAE appointed independent auditors to investigate how the value of its share of Airbus had fallen from the original estimates to the Rothschild valuation; however in September 2006 BAE agreed to the sale of its stake in Airbus to EADS for ¬£1.87 billion (‚Ç¨2.75 billion, $3.53 billion), pending BAE shareholder approval. On 4 October shareholders voted in favour of the sale, leaving Airbus entirely owned by EADS. 2008‚Äì2013 In February 2008, the United States Air Force awarded a $35 billion contract for KC-45 aerial refueling tankers to Northrop Grumman, with EADS as a major subcontractor. The contract, initially valued at $35 billion, would have seen Northrop Grumman and EADS would build a fleet of 179 planes based on the existing Airbus A330 to provide in-air refueling to military aircraft. Final assembly of the aircraft would take place at an Airbus plant near Mobile, Alabama. However the award was protested by Boeing, the other bidder on the project, which was upheld by the GAO. The competition was restarted and in March 2010, Northrop Grumman announced it was withdrawing its bid, with its CEO stating that the revised tender requirement favored Boeing.\\"Northrop drops out of bid to make Air Force aerial tankers\\", MarketWatch, 8 March 2010. On 20 April 2010, EADS announced it was re-entering the competition and intended to enter a bid with the KC-45.\\"EADS North America intends to submit proposal for U.S. Air Force tanker \\" , EADS North America press release, 20 April 2010 EADS reported a 763 million euros loss for 2009 as a result of a 1.8 billion euros charge on the troubled Airbus A400M project and a 240 million euros charge related to the A380.'Airbus delays propel EADS to ¬£691m loss' Daily Telegraph, 10 March 2010 In September 2012 it was reported that BAE and EADS were in merger discussions. In the event of a merger, BAE shareholders would own 40 % and EADS 60 % of the resultant organisation. EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater than the sum of its parts. On 10 October 2012, the merger proposal was abandoned. From EADS NV to Airbus SE In January 2014, EADS was reorganised as Airbus Group NV, with three divisions (Airbus, Airbus Defence and Space, and Airbus Helicopters.EADS changes name to Airbus, subscription requiredBBC News - EADS to be renamed Airbus Group. Bbc.co.uk (2013-07-31). Retrieved on 2013-08-16. On 27 May 2015 the company became a Societas Europaea (SE) (Latin: European Company), having been a Naamloze vennootschap (public limited company). In September 2016, Airbus Group announced that it would merge with its largest division, Airbus SAS, into a new entity and introduce a single Airbus brand, the merge to take effect on 1 January 2017. The group reorganized under the brand name of \\"Airbus\\" in January 2017. The subsidiaries Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space became operating divisions of the same company. Airbus Group SE changed its legal name to Airbus SE at its 2017 annual meeting on 12 April 2017. =2007 restructuring of Airbus SAS= On 9 October 2006 Christian Streiff, Humbert's successor, resigned due to differences with parent company EADS over the amount of independence he would be granted in implementing his reorganisation plan for Airbus. He was succeeded by EADS co-CEO Louis Gallois, bringing Airbus under more direct control of its parent company. On 28 February 2007, CEO Louis Gallois announced the company's restructuring plans. Entitled Power8, the plan would see 10,000 jobs cut over four years; 4,300 in France, 3,700 in Germany, 1,600 in the UK and 400 in Spain. 5,000 of the 10,000 would be at subcontractors. Plants at Saint Nazaire, Varel and Laupheim face sell off or closure, while Meaulte, Nordenham and Filton are \\"open to investors\\". As of 16 September 2008 the Laupheim plant has been sold to a Thales-Diehl consortium to form Diehl Aerospace and while the design activities at Filton have been retained, the manufacturing operations have been sold to British company GKN. The announcements resulted in Airbus unions in France and Germany threatening strike action. At the 2011 Paris Air Show, Airbus received total orders valued at about $72.2 billion for 730 aircraft, a new record in the civil aviation industry. The A320neo (\\"new engine option\\") model, announced in December 2010, received 667 orders; this, together with previous orders, resulted in a total of 1029 orders within six months of launch date, creating another industry record. =2016= The 10,000th aircraft, an A350, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 14 October In January 2016 Airbus announced it has signed a tentative agreement with Iran to sell 118 Airbus aircraft along with a comprehensive civil aviation cooperation package as a part of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Boeing has also announced its will to sell 80 jets directly to Iran Air as part of a proposed deal worth up to $17.6bn. However, In early July 2016, US House of Representatives passed amendments that would block US Department of Treasury funds from granting export licences or reexport of passenger commercial aircraft. Boeing reacted that if its deal with Iran is blocked by the US Congress, all other companies that supply to its rivals should be prohibited as well. Airbus, too, has said that it requires US's approval to export airliners to Iran, because parts of its aircraft are made in the US. The deal between Iran Air and Airbus was finally implemented, and the first new purchased Airbus aircraft, an A321, landed in Tehran's International Mehr Abad Airport on January 12, 2017; Airbus stated that the delivery has been in full compliance with the JCPOA and US government Office of Foreign Assets Control licenses. =2017= On 30 June, Airbus said its airliner sales team would now report directly to Tom Enders, Airbus Chief Executive, and by-pass Fabrice Bregier, who will lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality while Enders will lead sales and marketing. On 16 October, Airbus and Bombardier Aerospace announced a partnership on the CSeries program, with Airbus acquiring a 50.01% majority stake, to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years; Airbus‚Äô supply chain expertise should save production costs but headquarters and assembly remain in Qu√©bec while U.S. customers would benefit from a second Final Assembly Line in Mobile, Alabama. In the fall, Der Spiegel investigated systematic corruption and improper intermediates usage in past sales and questioned whether Enders can survive the scandal as he did not react quickly enough, then Handelsblatt reported the French government wants to control Airbus again and Bregier wants to get Enders fired to gain his position. Sales chief John Leahy was supposed to retire at the end of 2017 to be replaced by his deputy Kiran Rao. A few weeks before the switch, Rao told Airbus CEO Tom Enders that he was no longer available. After investigations into alleged bribery, Enders took personal responsibility for the sales organization compliance. Eric Schulz, aerospace engineer and president of Rolls-Royce plc Civil Aerospace, replaced Leahy in January 2018. In November, Paul Eremenko, Airbus's CTO, quit after two years. French unions held him responsible for the job cuts made at a French research facility nearby Paris. Tom Enders was counting on Paul Eremenko to create a radically different approach to R&D.; On 28 November 2017, Airbus announced a partnership with Rolls-Royce plc and Siemens to develop the E-Fan X hybrid- electric aircraft demonstrator, to fly in 2020. (Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Siemens) Enders' mandate as CEO ran until April 2019, but in December 2017 the Airbus board confirmed Enders will not stay beyond April 2019 and announced that in February 2018 Br√©gier will be replaced by Guillaume Faury, currently Airbus Helicopters CEO. This should have been disclosed in early 2018, however the media hype accelerated the timing but not the decision. When told by the board that he would not succeed Enders as CEO, Bregier chose to leave. Besides Enders, Bregier, Leahy and Eremenko, engineering chief Charles Champion is retiring at the end of 2017, Airbus North America chairman Allan McArtor is leaving, as is the unit's CEO Barry Eccleston to be replaced by Jeff Knittel, CEO of lessor CIT Aerospace. Head of military aircraft Fernando Alonso, civil aircraft division COO Tom Williams and head of programs Didier Evrard are also nearing retirement. For 2017, Airbus announced it received 1,109 net orders from 44 customers in 2017, and delivered 718 aircraft to 85 customers: 558 A320 Family (including 181 A320neo); 67 A330s; 78 A350 XWBs and 15 A380s. =2018= Following the UK decision to leave the EU, Airbus faced calls to move/reduce wing production from the UK. Currently produced in Broughton and designed in Filton since 1970, wing production employs 15,000 people, which is over 10% of Airbus staff. However Tom Enders promised the UK government that Airbus would retain its British operations ‚Äúlong into the future‚Äô‚Äô and see the U.K. as a \\"home country and a competitive place to invest.\\" Airbus will designate a new CEO to succeed Enders by the end of 2018, which will be submitted to shareholders at the spring 2019 annual meeting, with planemaking boss and former Eurocopter head Guillaume Faury as the main internal candidate. Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm will quit when Enders will leave in 2019. On 15 May, in its EU appeal ruling, the WTO concluded that the A380 and A350 received improper subsidies through repayable launch aids or low interest rates which could have been avoided, and Airbus agreed to correct those violations. On 13 September, Eric Schulz left the Chief Commercial Officer role for personal reasons and was replaced by Christian Scherer, CEO of ATR since October 2016. As Schulz was previously head of Rolls-Royce plc civil engines, currently suffering problems, airlines could had a skewed opinion. On 8 October, the Board of directors selected Guillaume Faury to succeed Tom Enders as Airbus CEO from 10 April 2019. On 21 November, Airbus appointed Michael Sch√∂llhorn, COO for BSH Home Appliances GmbH, to succeed Tom Williams as Chief Operating Officer (COO) for Airbus Commercial Aircraft from 1 February 2019, and Dominik Asam, CFO of Infineon Technologies, to succeed Harald Wilhelm as Chief Financial Officer from 10 April 2019. On 20 December 2018, Le Monde newspaper reported the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a corruption investigation, which could result in fines of up to 4-5 billion Euros. =2019= In February 2019, Airbus launched The OneAtlas Platform, a geospatial tool that applies artificial intelligence to satellite images and extracts insights for customers. May 2019 marked the 50th anniversary of the A300 launch in May 1969, while Airbus' profitability is stuck at 5%, far from the 10% management target. The A320 cash cow represents 50% of the revenues but the A350 production forecasts is revised downward, the A330 is stagnant, the A380 is cancelled, and the A400M is a loss maker. The helicopter business struggles with a difficult market, the defense business lacks strategy, the space sector lost its competitiveness, and the corruption investigation weakens the group. Competition with Boeing Airbus is in tight competition with Boeing every year for aircraft orders although Airbus has secured over 50% of aircraft orders in the decade since 2003. Airbus won a greater share of orders in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, Airbus achieved 1111 (1055 net) orders, compared to 1029 (net of 1002) for the same year at rival Boeing However, Boeing won 55% of 2005 orders proportioned by value; and in the following year Boeing won more orders by both measures. Airbus in 2006 achieved its second best year ever in its entire 35-year history in terms of the number of orders it received, 824, second only to the previous year. Airbus plans to increase production of A320 airliners to reach 40 per month by 2012, at a time when Boeing is increasing monthly 737 production from 31.5 to 35 per month. Regarding operational aircraft, there were 7,264 Airbus aircraft operational at April 2013. Although Airbus secured over 50% of aircraft orders in the decade since 2003, the number of Boeing aircraft still in operation at April 2013 still exceeded Airbus by 21% because Airbus made a late entry into the market, 1972 vs. 1958 for Boeing; this lead is diminishing as older aircraft are progressively retired. Though both manufacturers have a broad product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, is designed to be larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with the high end of the 787 and the low end of the 777. The A320 is bigger than the 737-700 but smaller than the 737‚Äì800. The A321 is bigger than the 737-900 but smaller than the previous 757‚Äì200. Airlines see this as a benefit since they get a more complete product range, from 100 seats to 500 seats, than if both companies offered identical aircraft. Airbus A350 XWB on its maiden flight. In recent years the Boeing 777 has outsold its Airbus counterparts, which include the A340 family as well as the A330-300. The smaller A330-200 competes with the 767, outselling its Boeing counterpart in recent years. The A380 is anticipated to further reduce sales of the Boeing 747, gaining Airbus a share of the market in very large aircraft, though frequent delays in the A380 programme have caused several customers to consider the refreshed 747‚Äì8. Airbus has also proposed the A350 XWB to compete with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, after being under great pressure from airlines to produce a competing model.  A¬≥  In 2015, Airbus Group said it was establishing an R&D; center and venture capital fund in Silicon Valley. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier stated: \\"What is the weakness of a big group like Airbus when we talk about innovation? We believe that we have better ideas than the rest of the world. We believe that we know because we control the technologies and platforms. The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true. And we need to be open to others' ideas and others' innovations,\\" Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders stated that \\"The only way to do it for big companies is really to create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation... That is what we have started to do but there is no manual... It is a little bit of trial and error. We all feel challenged by what the Internet companies are doing.\\" Six months after launch, the Airbus Group Venture fund in Silicon Valley became fully operational in January 2016.
