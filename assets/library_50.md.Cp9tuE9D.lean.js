It boasts two Munro summits: the higher peak Sgorr Dhearg () lies about east of Sgorr Dhonuill (Sgurr Dh√≤mhnaill). The mountain forms a horseshoe shape, with ridges pointing north enclosing the corrie of Gleann a' Chaolais (Glenachulish). The lower slopes on this side are cloaked in conifer plantations. To the south the mountain forms a steep ridge forming the northern wall of Glen Duror, which is also forested. There are several routes up Beinn a' Bheithir. One of the simplest is to head through the forestry up Gleann a' Chaolais, reaching the high bealach between the two summits. Both summits can be bagged from here, and the walker may descend by the route of ascent. Other routes on include the north and northwest ridges of Sgorr Dhearg, or a steep ascent from Glen Duror. Folk Tale The mountain at whose base tourists to Glencoe are landed was first called Beinn Ghuilbin but is now known as Beinn Bheithir. By tradition it got this name from a dragon which, long ago, took shelter in Corrie Liath, a great hollow in the face of the mountain and almost right above Ballachulish Pier. This dragon was apparently a terror to the surrounding district. From the lip of the corrie she overlooked the path round the foot of the mountain and, if the unsuspecting traveller attempted to pass by her, she would leap down and tear him to pieces. No one dared attack her nor could anyone tell how she might be destroyed until Charles, the Skipper, came the way. He anchored his vessel a good distance out from the site of the present pier and, between the vessel and the shore, formed a bridge of empty barrels lashed together with ropes and brisling with iron spikes. When the bridge was finished he kindled a large fire on board the vessel and placed pieces of flesh on the burning embers. As soon as the savour of burning flesh reached the corrie the dragon descended by a succession of leaps to the shore and thence tried to make her way out on the barrels to the vessel. But the spikes entered her body and tore her up so badly that she was nearly dead before she reached the outer edge of the bridge. Meantime the vessel was moved from the bridge until a wide interval was left between it and the last barrel. Over this interval the dragon had not sufficient strength left to leap to the deck of the vessel and, as she could not return the way she came, she died of her wounds where she was, at the end of the bridge. The people who lived in the neighbourhood of the mountain felt now at peace. But, if they did, little did they know of the new danger which threatened them. The cause of this new danger was a whelp which the old dragon left behind her in Corrie Liath. In course of time the whelp became a full-grown dragon which had a brood of young dragons hidden away in a corn stack at the foot of the mountain. When the farmer discovered them in his stack he at once set fire to it hoping thus to destroy the dangerous vermin it contained. Their shrieking was, with the wind, borne up the mountain-side and, as soon as it reached their mother, down she rushed to their assistance. But she was long in reaching them and in spite of all her efforts they were burned to death. When she saw this she stretched herself on a flat rock near the shore and continued to lash the rock with her tail until she killed herself. The rock is still known as the Dragon's Rock, and on it Beinn Bheithir House now stands.Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic and English Collected from Oral Tradition. by Rev.

It is a tourist and religious resort thanks to its sacred grotto (Sacro Speco), in the medieval St Benedict's Abbey, and for the Abbey of Santa Scolastica. At a time when several German monks had been assigned to the monastery, German printers established a printing press in the town. They printed the first books in Italy in the late 15th century. History Among the first ancient settlers in the area were the Aequi, an Italic people. In 304 BC they were conquered by the Romans, who introduced their civilization and took advantage of the waters of the Aniene river. The present name of the city comes from the artificial lakes of the luxurious villa that emperor Nero had built: in Latin Sublaqueum means \\"under the lake.\\" The name was applied to the town that developed nearby. The biggest of the three Subiaco Dams was the highest dam in the world until its destruction in 1305. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the villa and the town were abandoned, becoming almost forgotten ruins. When St. Benedict, at the age of fourteen (c. 494), retired from the world and lived for three years in a cave above the river Anio, he was supplied with the necessaries of life by a monk, St. Roman. From this grotto, St. Benedict developed the concepts and organization of the Benedictine Order. He built twelve monasteries, including one at the grotto, and placed twelve monks in each. In 854 a record noted its renovation. In this year, Pope Leo IV is said to have consecrated an altar to Sts. Benedict and Scholastica and another to St. Sylvester. Another renovation took place in 1053 under Abbot Humbert of St. Scholastica. Abbot John V, created cardinal by Pope Gregory VII, made the grotto the terminus of a yearly procession, built a new road, and had the altars reconsecrated. In 1200 there was a community of twelve, which Innocent III made a priory; John XXII in 1312 appointed a special abbot to the monks. A new road was built by the city in 1688. The sacred grotto is still a favourite pilgrimage. On October 27, 1909, Pius X granted a daily plenary indulgence to those who receive Holy Communion there and pray according to the intention of the Pope (Acta. Ap. Sedis, II, 405). The Abbey of St. Scolastica, located about a mile and a half below the grotto, was built originally by St Benedict about 520, and endowed by the Roman patricians, Tertullus and √Üquitius. The second abbot, St. Honoratus, changed the old monastery into a chapter room and built a new one, dedicating it to Sts. Cosmas and Damian. It was destroyed by the Lombards in 601 and abandoned for a century. By order of John VII, it was rebuilt by Abbot Stephen and consecrated to Saints Benedict and his sister, Scholastica. Demolished again in 840 by the Saracens and then in 981 by the Hungarians, it was rebuilt each time. Benedict VII consecrated the new church, and henceforth the abbey was dedicated to Santa Scholastica. In 1052, Leo IX came to Subiaco to settle various disputes and to correct abuses; a similar visit was made by Gregory VII. Special favour was shown by Paschal II, who took the abbey from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Tivoli and made it an abbacy nullius. Its temporal welfare was also a care of the popes. Among others, Innocent III at his visit in 1203 increased the revenues of the abbey. With the decline of religious fervor, strife and dissension arose to such an extent that Abbot Bartholomew in 1364, by command of the pope, had to dismiss some of the incorrigible monks and fill their places with religious from other monasteries. Numerous monks were brought in from Germany, and for many decades Subiaco was a center of German thrift, science, and art. Urban VI (1378‚Äì1389) abolished the abbots for life, took away from the monks the right of election, and gave the administration and revenues to a member of the Curia. The assignment of German monks to Subiaco attracted other Germans. The printers Sweinheim and Pannartz established a printing press in Subiaco and printed Donatus pro parvulis, Lactantius (1465) and De Civitate Dei (1467). Those were the first books to be printed in Italy. Pope Callixtus III, in 1455, gave the abbey in commendam to a cardinal. The first of these was the Spanish Cardinal Juan de Torquemada and the second Roderigo Borgia (later Alexander VI), who remodeled the Castrum Sublacence, once the summer resort of the popes, and made it the residence of the commendatory abbot. Many of these abbots cared little for the religious life of the monks and looked only for revenue. As an example, Pompeo Colonna, Bishop of Rieti, commendatory abbot since 1506, squandered the goods of the abbey and gave the income to unworthy subjects. On complaint of the community, in 1510 Julius II readjusted matters and restored the monastic possessions. For spiritual benefit, a union had been made between Subiaco and the Abbey of Farfa, but it lasted a short time. In 1514, Subiaco joined the Congregation of Santa Justina, whose abbot-general was titular of St. Scholastica, while a cardinal remained commendatory abbot. Even after this union, there were quarrels between Subiaco and Farfa, Subiaco and Monte Cassino, essentially among the Germans and the Italians. After this little is known from historical records about the abbey and the city until the 19th century. In 1798-1799 and 1810-1814 French troops under Napoleon entered the city, plundering the monasteries and the churches. In 1849 and 1867 Giuseppe Garibaldi conquered the city in his plan to destroy the temporal rule of the Pope and unify Italy: in 1870 the city become definitively part of the Regno d'Italia. In 1891, a Benedictine abbey founded earlier in western Arkansas, United States, changed its name to Subiaco as part of an effort to more closely align its teachings and practices to those of the famous abbeys of the Italian namesake. In the first years of the 20th century, the area was improved by national investment in infrastructure, with the connection to a railway, a hydroelectric plant and an aqueduct. Electricity was brought to the houses and a hospital was built. In World War II, Subiaco was bombed by Allied planes. Main sights St. Francis' bridge.

They practised their profession in the seaport of Aegeae, then in the Roman province of Syria. Accepting no payment for their services led to them being named anargyroi (from the Greek , 'the silverless' or 'unmercenaries'); it has been said that, by this, they attracted many to the Christian faith. Lives Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian, by Gerard Seghers, 17th century, Private collection, U.S. Nothing is known of their lives except that they suffered martyrdom in Syria during the persecution of the Emperor Diocletian. According to Christian traditions, the twin brothers were born in Arabia and became skilled doctors. Saladino d'Ascoli, a 15th century Italian physician, claims that the medieval electuary, a pasty mass consisting of a drug mixed with sugar and water or honey suitable for oral administration, known as opopira,Opopira magna, a pharmaceutical preparation from the Antidotarius magnus NCBI PubMed, in German, Daems WF, Ledermann F. a complex compound medicine used to treat diverse maladies including paralysis, was invented by Cosmas and Damian.Saladino d'Ascoli, \\"Compendium Aromatariorum\\", In: Mesue cum expositione mondini super canones vniuersales. ac etiam cum expositione Christophori de honestis in antidotarium eiusdem...

However, according to legend they stayed true to their faith, enduring being hung on a cross, stoned and shot by arrows and finally suffered execution by beheading. Anthimus, Leontius and Euprepius, their younger brothers, who were inseparable from them throughout life, shared in their martyrdom. Veneration Cosmas and Damian miraculously transplant the black leg of the Ethiopian onto the white body of the patient. Reliquary (1400/1420) in St. Michael's Church, Munich containing the alleged skulls of Cosmas and Damian. The convent of the Poor Clares in Madrid also has two skulls of Saints Cosmas and Damian. Pope Felix IV presents Saints Cosmas and Damian with the basilica he rededicated to them. The veneration of Cosmas and Damian quickly spread beyond Constantinople; accounts of their martyrdom were rewritten by various authors such as Andrew of Crete, Peter of Argos, Theodore II Laskaris, and a certain Maximus around 1300. The legends are preserved also in Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Armenian, and Latin. As early as the 4th century, churches dedicated to the twin saints were established at Jerusalem, in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. Devotion to the two saints spread rapidly in both East and West. Theodoret records the division of their reputed relics. Their relics, deemed miraculous, were buried in the city of Cyrrus in Syria. Churches were built in their honor by Archbishop Proclus and by Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565), who sumptuously restored the city of Cyrus and dedicated it to the twins, but brought their purported relics to Constantinople; there, following his cure, ascribed to the intercession of Cosmas and Damian, Justinian, in gratitude also built and adorned their church at Constantinople, and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage. At Rome Pope Felix IV (526‚Äì530) rededicated the Library of Peace (Bibliotheca Pacis) as a basilica of Santi Cosma e Damiano in the Forum of Vespasian in their honour. The church is much rebuilt but still famed for its sixth-century mosaics illustrating the saints. What are said to be their skulls are venerated in the convent of the Clares in Madrid, where they have been since 1581, the gift of Maria, daughter of Emperor Charles V. They had previously been removed from Rome to Bremen in the tenth century, and thence to Bamberg. Other skulls said to be theirs were discovered in 1334 by Burchard Grelle, Archbishop of Bremen.

The cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling made a shrine for the relics, which was finished around 1420. The shrine, made from carved oak wood covered with gilt and rolled silver is considered an important mediaeval gold work.Konrad Elmsh√§user, \\"Der werdende Territorialstaat der Erzbisch√∂fe von Bremen (1236‚Äì1511): I.

In 1649 Bremen's Chapter, Lutheran by this time, sold the shrine without the heads to Maximilian I of Bavaria. The two heads remained in Bremen and came into the possession of the small Roman Catholic community. They were shown from 1934 to 1968 in the Church of St. Johann and in 1994 they were buried in the crypt.(Wilhelm Tacke: St. Johann in Bremen - erine 600j√§hrige Geschichte - von den Bettelbr√ºdern bis zu den Pr√∂psten, Bremen 2006, S. 172ff.) The shrine is now shown in the Jesuit church of St Michael in Munich. At least since 1413 another supposed pair of skulls of the saints has been stored in St Stephens's Cathedral in Vienna. Other relics are claimed by the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. The martyrdom of Saints Cosmas and Damian by Fra Angelico (Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris). The martyr twins are invoked in the Canon of the Mass in the prayer known as the Communicantes (from the first Latin word of the prayer): \\"In communion with the whole Church, they venerate above all others the memory of the glorious ever-virgin Mary, Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, then of blessed Joseph, husband of the Virgin, your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, ...John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian and all your Saints: grant through their merits and prayers that in all things we may be defended by the help of your protection.\\" They are also invoked in the Litany of the Saints, and in the older form of the Roman rite, in the Collect for Thursday in the Third Week of Lent, as the station church for this day is Santi Cosma e Damiano. Their feast day in the General Roman Calendar, which had been on September 27, was moved in 1969 to September 26, because September 27 is the dies natalis (\\"day of birth\\" into Heaven) of Saint Vincent de Paul, now more widely venerated in the Latin Church.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 140 In Canada it has been moved to Sept. 25 (as Sept. 26 is the Feast of the Canadian Martyrs in Canada).http://nlo.cccb.ca/images/stories/pdfs/nationallitcalender2016_01_27.pdf Sts Cosmas and Damian are regarded as the patrons of physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists and are sometimes represented with medical emblems. Cosmas and Damian are depicted as supporters of the arms of the guild of barber-surgeons carved into a capital, 15th century, from the Carmes monastery in Trie-sur- Ba√Øse in southwestern France. The inscription reads, \\"Saints Cosmas and Damian pray for us\\". In Brazil, the twin saints are regarded as protectors of children, and September 27 is commemorated, especially in Rio de Janeiro, by giving children bags of candy with the saints' effigy printed on them and throughout the entire state of Bahia where Catholics and adepts of Candombl√© religion offer typical food such as caruru. The ritual consists of first offering the food to seven children that are no older than seven years old and then having them feast while sitting on the floor and eating with their hands. Only after all children have finished can the guests enjoy the food that is being offered. The Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, in Igarassu, Pernambuco is Brazil's oldest church, built in 1535. In the UK St Damian is the dexter side supporter in the coat of arms of the British Dental Association. Sts. Cosmas & Damian are venerated every year in Utica, New York at St. Anthony's Parish during the annual pilgrimage which takes place on the last weekend of September (close to the Sept. 27 feast day). There are thousands of pilgrims who come to honor the saints. Over 80 busloads come from Canada and other destinations. The 2-day festival includes music (La Banda Rosa), much Italian food, masses and processions through the streets of East Utica. It is one of the largest festivals honoring saints in the northeast USA. Eastern Christianity Icon of Saints Cosmas and Damian (17th century, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland). In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Saints Cosmas and Damian are venerated as a type of saint known as Unmercenary Physicians (, anargyroi, \\"without money\\"). This classification of saints is unique to the Eastern Church and refers to those who heal purely out of love for God and man, strictly observing the command of Jesus: \\"Freely have you received, freely give.\\" (¬´ŒîœâœÅŒµ·Ω∞ŒΩ ·ºêŒªŒ¨Œ≤ŒµœÑŒµ, Œ¥œâœÅŒµ·Ω∞ŒΩ Œ¥œåœÑŒµ...¬ª ) While each of the Unmercenaries has his own feast days, all are commemorated together on the first Sunday in November, in a feast known as the Synaxis of the Unmercenary Physicians. The Orthodox celebrate no less than three different sets of saints by the name of Cosmas and Damian, each with their own distinct feast day: *Saints Cosmas and Damian of Cilicia (Arabia) (October 17) Brothers, according to Christian legend they were beaten and beheaded together with three other Christians: Leontius, Anthimus, and Eutropius. *Saints Cosmas and Damian of Asia Minor ‚Äî alternately, of Mesopotamia (November 1) Twin sons of Saint Theodota. Died peacefully and were buried together at Thereman in Mesopotamia. *Saints Cosmas and Damian of Rome (July 1) Brothers, according to Christian tradition they were martyred outside Rome by a jealous pagan physician during the reign of the Roman Emperor Carinus (283‚Äì284). Orthodox icons of the saints depict them vested as laymen holding medicine boxes. Often each will also hold a spoon with which to dispense medicine. The handle of the spoon is normally shaped like a cross to indicate the importance of spiritual as well as physical healing, and that all cures come from God. The Apse of the Church of SS.

The division was created as part of the preparations for the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, D-Day. Major-General Percy Hobart commanded the division and was in charge of the development of armoured vehicles that were solutions to problems of the amphibious landing on the defended French coastline; these unusual-looking tanks it developed and operated were known as \\"Hobart's Funnies\\". They included tanks that floated, could clear mines, destroy defences, carry and lay bridges, and roadways. The practical use of these specialist tanks was confirmed during the landings on the beaches. Its vehicles were distributed as small units across the divisions taking part in the landings and subsequent operations. The division remained in action during the North-west European Campaign, providing specialised support during assaults to the 21st Army Group and, occasionally, to American units outside 21st. Again they were of significant use during the Rhine crossings. History Brigadier N. W. Duncan of the 30th Armoured Brigade watches the attack on Caen from beside his Humber scout car outside Beuville, 8 July 1944. The division was formed as a standard armoured formation serving in the UK under Northern Command in August 1942. General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who foresaw the need for specialised armoured vehicles, offered command of the division to Major-General Percy Hobart in October 1942. Initially the division included infantry, artillery and engineers but the infantry unit, 185th, was removed in September 1942, its artillery regiments were all removed by April 1943 and its engineer units were generally removed by November 1943. Hobart gave firm direction and the strange-looking tanks it developed and operated were known as Hobart's Funnies. They included tanks that floated, could clear mines, destroy defences, carry and lay bridges, and roadways - anything that would enable the invasion force to get ashore and break through the German defences. The division landed in France in June 1944. The division was further used during the Battle for Brest, the battle for the Scheldt estuary (Operation Infatuate), the battle for the Roer Triangle (Operation Blackcock), the Rhine crossings (Operation Plunder) and the Elbe crossing. The 79th Armoured Division was disbanded on 20 August 1945. Hobart subsequently commanded the Specialized Armour Development Establishment (SADE), which was formed from elements of the 79th together with the Assault Training and Development Centre.Fletcher, p. 39 Equipment The equipment included the following: *The \\"Duplex Drive\\" tank was a Sherman tank converted for amphibious use with twin types of locomotion: tracks and propellers; the design was used by the Allies in the opening phases of the Normandy landings in 1944. *The Sherman Crab was a mine flail tank designed to clear a safe path through a mine-field by deliberately detonating mines in front of the vehicle; the design was first used during the North African Campaign in 1942. *The Churchill Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) was a heavily modified Churchill III or IV armed with a \\"Petard\\", a 290mm spigot mortar that fired a 40 pound (18 kg) \\"Flying dustbin\\" demolition bomb. *The 'Bobbin' Carpet Layer was a Churchill AVRE fitted out with a roll of matting for laying on a beach or other soft surface. *The Fascine Carrier was a Churchill AVRE which could carry and lay large bundles of sticks to repair holes in the ground. *The Small Box Girder ('SBG') bridge layer was a Churchill AVRE fitted and lay a bridge large enough to cross a 30 foot gap. *The Churchill Armoured Ramp Carrier ('ARK') was a turretless Churchill tank with ramps at either end which, when lowered, could form a mobile bridge. *The \\"Buffalo\\" Landing Vehicle Tracked ('LVT') was a tracked vehicle intended to carry replenishments from ships ashore; the design was used at the Battle of the Scheldt during the crossing of the Rhine in 1945. *The Kangaroo armoured personnel carrier was a self-propelled gun or other armoured vehicle, surplus to requirements which was converted by removal of the gun or turret into an infantry carrier. The Kangaroo was not developed until after the D-day landings and *The Canal Defence Light ('CDL') was a powerful carbon-arc searchlight mounted on a tank which could be deployed to dazzle and confuse enemy troops. * The Churchill Crocodile was a Churchill VII tank in which the hull machine gun was replaced with a flamethrower; fuel was carried behind the tank in an armoured wheeled trailer.

Weatherhead was noted for his preaching ministry at City Temple in London and for his books, including The Will of God, The Christian Agnostic, and Psychology, Religion, and Healing.  Life  City Temple, where Weatherhead ministered for several decades, was rebulilt in 1958 under his direction Weatherhead was born in London in 1893. He trained for the Methodist ministry at Richmond Theological College, in south-west London. The First World War cut short his training, and he became Methodist minister at Farnham, Surrey, in September 1915. After serving in India, Manchester, and Leeds, Weatherhead became the minister of the City Temple, a Congregational Church on Holborn Viaduct in London. He served there from 1936 until his retirement in 1960. From 1930 till 1939, Weatherhead was a member of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group and wrote several books reflecting the group's values, including Discipleship and The Will of God. He often symbolised the \\"head\\" of the Oxford Group London. His book This is the Victory was first printed in 1940 (preface dated November 1940) and reprinted in March 1942. In the period of time between these two editions, the City Temple was \\"gutted by fire from incendiary bombs dropped from enemy aeroplanes\\". He was able to continue his ministry thanks to the nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate church. After the war, Weatherhead raised the funds to rebuild the City Temple, largely from John D. Rockefeller. The City Temple stands to this day and is now a congregation of the United Reformed Church. Despite opposition, Weatherhead was elected as President of the Methodist Conference for 1955‚Äì1956. The re-built City Temple was opened in the presence of the Queen Mother in 1958. In 1960, Weatherhead retired to live at Bexhill- on-Sea. He died in 1976. The three books of his sermons which Weatherhead considered his best were That Immortal Sea, Over His Own Signature and Key Next Door.Bishop, John. \\"Leslie Weatherhead: Surgeon of the Soul\\", p. 2 Three biographies of Leslie Weatherhead have appeared: in 1960, for young people, Dr. Leslie Weatherhead of the City Temple by Christopher Maitland; in 1975 Leslie Weatherhead: A Personal Portrait by his son A. Kingsley Weatherhead, a professor of English; and most recently in 1999 Doctor of Souls: Leslie D. Weatherhead 1893‚Äì1976 by John C. Travell.  Theology  Weatherhead is identified as a liberal Christian. He believed in God, whom he felt most comfortable referring to as \\"Father.\\" Like most Christians, he felt that the Creator was higher on a scale of values, but that God must also be personal enough to interact in a direct relationship with people. Weatherhead understood that God cared for humankind but that some would find this difficult (since suffering exists in the world). If \\"God is love\\" it would be difficult to deny God's Providence. Weatherhead believed in the divinity of Christ, in that he (Jesus) stood in a special relationship with God and \\"indeed an incarnation of God in a fuller sense than any other known Being.\\" Weatherhead pointed out that the New Testament never refers to Jesus as God and neither did Jesus refer to himself in this way. Jesus called himself the Son of Man and the Word. To say that Jesus was the \\"only begotten son\\" of God would be an impossibility, as such information is not presently available. The virgin birth was not an issue for Weatherhead, having (in his view) never been a major tenet for being a follower of Christ. Moreover, the New Testament traces Jesus' lineage through his father Joseph, not Mary, to show that he descended from the house of David. Weatherhead notes that Jesus did not claim to be sinless. He comments on the fact that Jesus got angry, cursed a fig tree because it didn't produce fruit and rebuked Peter, one of his closest disciples, calling him Satan. Since Jesus was morally superior, many theologians assume him to be sinless, though Jesus never made that claim for himself. Weatherhead apparently agreed with Dr. Nathaniel Mickelm, whom he quoted regarding the blood sacrifice of Jesus as something that was unnecessary for forgiveness. For Mickelm (and subsequently for Weatherhead), it would be a perversion of God to suppose that \\"God did not and could not forgive sins apart from the death of Christ.\\" Yet that sacrifice revealed something of the nature of God that made one want to be forgiven. As for the Holy Spirit, Weatherhead conceded agnosticism. \\"Few Christians, whom I know, think of the Holy Spirit as a separate Person,\\" he said. His view was that this would equate to worshiping two gods instead of one. His view of the church was an idealistic one. The church on earth should be a photocopy of the divine original, in which all who loved Christ would be joined together to \\"worship and move forward to the unimaginable unity with God which is his will.\\" =Virgin Birth= Reformed minister Ian Paisley, later Lord Bannside, denounced Weatherhead in a 1969 sermon as \\"the man that said that Jesus Christ was the bastard son of Zechariah (John the Baptist's father) ‚Äì and Mary, who was a prostitute of the temple.... That is about as vile a thing as anybody could say.\\" He called Weatherhead \\"an arch-apostate\\", whose place was \\"in hell\\".Paisley, Ian R. K. (2 March 1969) \\"Apostasy vs Fundamentalism\\" Sermon given at the Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church, Belfast, Country Antrim, Ulster. In his own view, Weatherhead had made every effort to present Mary as a very pure and sincere (if immature) young maiden‚Äîwho had simply interpreted the Angel's Annunciation as a divine instruction to go and stay for three months with her cousin's husband, Zechariah‚Äîand that was when Jesus was conceived. Weatherhead regarded it as significant that the Gospels contain absolutely no record of Jesus mentioning that his mother had conceived him without a human father. Weatherhead's theory that Jesus was the son of Zechariah later became part of the teachings of Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. Encountering it in Weatherhead's The Christian Agnostic, Unificationist theologian Young Oon Kim adopted it as the best explanation of the birth of Jesus in her work Unification Theology, a standard textbook of the church.Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement by Ruth A. Tucker 1989 pages 250-251Unification Theology: Some Additional Problems Christian author Ruth A. Tucker comments in her book Another Gospel: \\"Kim's Christology is a prime example of liberal theology.... By diminishing the role of Jesus, Kim paves the way for the exaltation of Sun Myung Moon.\\"Tucker, Ruth A. (1989) Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, p. 251. =Scripture= Weatherhead believed the Bible to be an inspired collection of works that progressively revealed man's search for and understanding of God, culminated in the best representation of God's true nature in Jesus Christ. He was, however, critical of many passages including some from Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy because they went against the nature of what Jesus taught, stating that \\"some of the passages of Browning are of far superior spiritual value.\\" Weatherhead insisted that one must reject anything in the Bible that did not coincide with the gospel of Christ, that is, anything that did not harmonise with the spirit of \\"love, liberty, gaiety, forgiveness, joy and acceptance.\\"  Reception  Weatherhead was a highly controversial figure on account of his questioning of some of the central tenets of the Christian faith‚Äîhe once said he regarded \\"creeds and confessions of faith\\" as \\"museum specimens\\"Weatherhead, Leslie D. (1928). The Transforming Friendship. London: Epworth Press, p. 56.‚Äîand his incorporation into Christianity of elements from other religions and from spiritualism. In the view of Professor David D. Larsen, of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, \\"Weatherhead jettisoned historical Christianity\\". He denied the Atonement and the efficacy of the Blood of Christ in A Plain Man Looks at the Cross, and the bodily Resurrection of Christ in The Manner of the Resurrection in the Light of Modern Science and Psychical Research. He dismissed the virgin birth, was inclined to believe that Zechariah was the father of Jesus, thought that the \\"legion\\" of demons probably meant that the man had been molested as a child by Roman legionnaires, and regarded the Apostle Paul as hopelessly neurotic. Weatherhead regularly attended spiritist s√©ances, at one of which John Wesley appeared to him.Larsen, David L. \\"Leslie D. Weatherhead: The Sermon as Psychotherapy\\", p. 2. Preaching.com. In 1957 he gave a lecture to the City Temple Literary Society on \\"The Case for Reincarnation\\".Weatherhead, Leslie D. (1958). \\"The Case for Reincarnation\\". M. C. Peto, Surrey, England. He continued to advocate reincarnation for the rest of his life in books like The Christian Agnostic and Life Begins at Death. For Professor Horton Davies, Weatherhead was \\"unrivalled as a twentieth-century physician of souls and preacher of the integration of personality through Christ\\". Professor Larsen, however, while agreeing that Weatherhead was \\"a brilliant preacher\\", judges his sermons to be theologically \\"vacuous and empty\\". Weatherhead, he writes, was perhaps the most striking example in the British Isles of \\"the increasing horizontalization and psychologization of the sermon\\", a tendency wittily characterised by E. Brooks Holifield as \\"From Salvation to Self- Realization\\".Holifield, E. Brooks (1983). A History of Pastoral Care in America: From Salvation to Self-Realization. Abingdon Press. Weatherhead's scorn for theology‚Äîhe claimed that poets had more insight than theologians‚Äîand penchant for \\"preaching as psychotherapy\\" made him, in Larsen's view, \\"a tragic instance in which psychical research replaced 'sound doctrine'\\".Larsen, David L. \\"Leslie D. Weatherhead: The Sermon as Psychotherapy\\", p. 1. Preaching.com. Even his psychology, which drew on fringe thinkers as well as more mainstream figures like Freud, is now \\"severely dated. No one today talks about Odic force and the leakage of psychic energy. His 55 books are virtually unread today.\\" John Taylor, reviewing Doctor of Souls states that \\"[Weatherhead's] writings still have an impact on Churches today, and Christians read and re-read his works\\". Nevertheless, though Weatherhead was a \\"great man\\", he \\"remains an enigma.... His name and ministry still enable passions to arise, depending how you see him.\\" As Minister of \\"a supra- denominational church\\" like the City Temple, \\"he was largely free to follow his own agenda\\", which he did, \\"not accepting the doctrine of the Virgin Birth, nor being comfortable with the doctrine of the Trinity\\". He was \\"a rebel, breaking out from the confines of Methodism\\", and impossible to imagine \\"in a traditional Congregational church\\".Taylor, John. \\"Review of John Travell, Doctor of Souls  Works  Weatherhead wrote many books, including: * After Death: A Popular Statement of the Modern Christian View of Life Beyond the Grave (1923). * What we believe to-day about the Old Testament (1924) * The Transforming Friendship.

The Siberian region is rich in resources, including coal, oil and metal ores Contribution to Soviet economy Siberia‚Äôs contribution to the Soviet economy in percent of national output was given in Soviet statistical yearbooks for 1973 (1940 in brackets) as: Coal 33% (23%), Coking coal 30% (17%), Oil 21% (1.6%), Natural gas 8.5% (from 1.5% in 1950), Electric power output 18% (6.6%), Iron ore 6.9% (1.6%), Pig iron 9.5% (10%), Crude steel 8.3% (10%), Rolled steel 10% (9.1%). But regional breakdowns were omitted in the yearbooks from 1973, except for a few 1975 figures.Theodore Shabad and Victor L. Mote: Gateway to Siberian Resources (The BAM) p. 54 (Halstead Press/John Wiley, New York, 1977) Energy sources =Coal= In the important Chelyabinsk coalfields, production rose from 390,000 tonnes in 1925 to 3,519,000 tonnes in 1936. The total production for the East Urals was 8,080,000 tonnes in 1937. Reserves for the following coalfields are shown in millions of tonnes: *East Urals: (Triassic lignite): 2,872 *Karaganda (Low Carboniferous period, for coking): 52,696 *Kuznets (Permian, for coking): 450,658 *Minusinsk (Permian): 20,612 *Chulym-Yenisei: (Jurassic lignite): 43,000 *Kansk: (Jurassic lignite): 42,000 *Irkutsk and Transbaikalia (Jurassic): 81,397 *Bureya: 26,116 *Suchan (for coking): 42,000 *Tunguska (low Carboniferous): 400,000 *Lena (Mesozoic): 60,000 Kuznetsk Coal Zone The development of the coal fields of Kuznetsk Basin, (sometimes called the \\"Kuzbass\\") transformed the Siberian steppe. The south sector of the Trans- Siberian Railway became a great industrial center because of the activity surrounding the coalfields. These ancient reserves of 13,000,000,000 tonnes grew to 450,658,000,000 tonnes. In 1937, the 50 mines in this area produced a total of 17,300,000 tonnes. The coal production of this zone was comparable with that of all of British India, and half of that produced by Japan. Kuznetsk coal was the best in the USSR, with high energy and low sulphur content. The total anthracite reserve was 54 million tonnes; and was used in the Ural-Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine. Siberia is also the coldest winters to survive, this includes freezing temperature such as -50 degrees. { cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom:1px solid black;\\" ! style=\\"border-right:1px solid black;\\"  Years ! style=\\"border- right:1px solid black;\\"  Millions of Tonnes !

Production in 1937 was 3,937,200 tonnes. Other important coal deposits are: Minusinsk near Chernogorsk, which joins the mining zone of Chulym-Yenisei at the Yenisei river; the Kansk deposits north of Krasnoyarsk; the Irkutsk deposits, which yielded 3,000,000 tonnes from the Cheremkovo mine in 1937; the Lake Baikal deposits; the Lena sector; the Norilsk sector in Tunguska mining zone; the Sangar Khai founts in the Amur River and Bureya Rivers near Vladivostok, the Artem and Suchan mines with 1937 production of 2,110,000 tonnes and 590,000 tonnes respectively; and the Sakhalin coal deposits in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains in central Asia. In the Minusinsk area, the estimated reserves are 20,612,000,000 tonnes; the Chulym-Yenisei mine is estimated at 43,000,000,000 tonnes; the Kansk sources estimated at 42,000,000,000 tonnes; and Cheremkhovo estimated at 79,000,000,000 tonnes. The Kuznets area has excellent coal for coke, chemical and gas production. Production in 1913 was 774,000 tonnes. In 1927, these mines extracted about 2,600,000 tonnes to maintain one extraction of 16,800,000 tonnes. The modernized Prokopyevsk mine has an expected production capacity of about 3,200,000 tonnes. The other sources are in Stalinsk (Kuznets), Lenin-Kuznets, Kemerovo, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Chernogorsk, and Cheremkhovo =Petroleum= The Siberian petroleum sources follow (in metric tonnes - 1 metric tonne of petroleum is equivalent to 5 or 10 barrels, or 42 gallons, depending on the density) *Emba: 1,190,400,000 *Perm-Kama: 3,540,000,000 *Other Zones at West Urals and Volga: 471,500,000 *Sakhalin: 339,800,000 *Central Asia: 427,100,000 Table of Total production (for 45 oil well areas) *1901: 11,000,000 *1913: 7,627,000 *1920: 2,915,000 *1928: 11,625,400 *1932: 21,413,200 *1936: 27,337,700 The most important Siberian petroleum zones are the West Siberian petroleum basin, Central Urals, Sakhalin Island, Nordvyl on the Arctic Siberian coast, and the Kamchatka peninsula. From the Caspian Sea there is one oil pipeline, which continues to the petrol camps of Emba at Orsk and ends in Omsk, in western Siberia. Sakhalin Island has the most important oil reserves in the Russian Far East. In 1936, the Ohka oil wells extracted about 470,000 tonnes; one-third were obtained for Japanese concessionaires. In the Emba River area about 466,000 tonnes were extracted from about 20 pits of a total of 300 yaciments in 1937. Total USSR oil production was 230,700,000 tonnes and there exist other reserves of 652,000,000 tonnes. =Electrical power generation= The third source of energy is hydro electricity. The region boasts large rivers capable of accommodating in-river hydro plants of 1000 MW and more per project. This potential was realised at an early stage, leading to investigations into the hydro potential of Pamir Tien-Shan and other East Siberian hydro resources. Today these hydro systems contribute roughly 40% of the electricity produced in Russia's Second Electricity Zone (Siberia) and helps to explain why the wholesale electricity prices in Zone 2 are structurally cheaper than in Zone 1 (European Russia). In 2011, Russia's electricity consumption totalled 1022 TWh, of which Hydropower contributed 63TWh. These energy producing and disposes in 50% of time raised in about 280.690 gigawatts (GW), between of theirs based in one disposition of 95% stay 58 GW. To increase output, studies were made of the Lena, Yenisei and Ob river systems. In the Lenin Program in 1920, proposed construction of power systems in the Urals, Yenisei, Angara River and Lake Baikal. Some of these projects are similar to the Grand Coulee Dam in the Columbia River. A major hydroelectric powerplant was constructed in 1932 on the Dnieper River, at a high latitude in Zaporozhe. But it was destroyed in 1941 by retreating Soviet forces during World War II. The plant had a production capacity of 900 MW, was about 2,500 feet long, and rose 125 feet above water level. In 1940 the total production capacity was 2.5 GW. The new plan proposed plants on a gigantic scale, on the Angara river. Planned output was 9 GW, with four other plants in high Yenisei producing about 4 GW more. Iron deposits Siberian iron sources were more assorted. They are at Magnitogorsk, Nizhni Tagil deposits in the south of Kuznetsk, the Angara River reserves, and Russian Far East mines. The mines of the Urals have been known since 1702: Magnitogorsk with annual extraction of 6,000,000 tonnes in 1931, minerals being magnetite and secondarily martite, with 55% or 66% of iron content. The other and oldest center was in Ninshi-Tagil. The total Ural iron reserves were 1,390,670,000 tonnes, of which one-third are limonite and about 450,000,000 correspond directly at Magnitogorsk. When the deposits in Kuznets began to be exploited, in 1930 recent discovered the Mountainous Shoria iron deposits, with reserves calculated as 292,412,000 tonnes, 45% iron content, and the Karaganda deposits. The other important founts stay in Petrovsk- Zabaikal near Baikal Lake, and the Little Khingan Mountains in the Soviet side of the frontier. Other iron resources in East Siberia are the Angara and Ilim river areas northwest of Baikal Lake, with production of 420,850,000 tonnes. No less than 30% of USSR iron production in the USSR was obtained in the Kuznets zone in 1937. Iron deposits: *Urals: sources of these mineral exist in Nizhni-Tagil, Zlatoust and Magnitogorsk, with a total production of 2,600,000 tonnes in 1937. *Gornaya Shoria: exist iron, in Magnetite form, inside of Calize mineral why poses one 45% of iron content, but more Sulphur. *Ridder: if extracted iron mixed with lead and zinc. Your total production in 1936 are about 1,000 tonnes. At the same time in the same mine extracted gold, copper and tin. Other minerals and general observationsManganese: mined in the Urals, Kazakhstan and west of Krasnoyarsk. Their extractions effectuated in Achinsk Mine with one mineral with 20 or 25% of purity. The total production in 1937 was about 100,000 tonnes. *Copper: possess ample reserves in Urals and Kazakhastan. Its total production in 1930 was 34,105 tonnes, increasing in 1936 to 83,000 tonnes. In East Kazakhastan exist the Yaciment of Kounrad, their minerals are composed of less than 2% copper, and these extraction are uneconomic. And the mine of Djezkazgan with double production why mentioned mine above. *Pyrite: the founts of these mineral stay in diverse sites, such as Krasnouralsk and Orsk. *Lead and zinc: the sources stay in the Siberian areas of Ridder Mine in Altai, Transbaikalia and Maritime Province. The total production of lead and zinc in 1936 were 55,000 and 63,000 tonnes respectively. *Aluminum: the sources of these material stay in North Urals, in Khabakovsk ancient, Nadezhdinsk, and south Urals in Kamensk. The USSR has a total production of aluminum in 1939 of 60,000 tonnes. *Nickel: the most important deposits are in Norilsk, near low Yenisei. Local production was 3,000 tonnes in 1938. *Gold: Was believed to be mined before in the Urals and in Siberia from medieval times. The estimates in 1936, mentioned about 5,173,000 oz, which then reduced later to about 4,500,000 oz. These deposits exist near the Aldan and Kolyma rivers in Yakutia and others in Central Asia and the Urals. *Chromium: In the Urals mountains was obtained 200,000 tonnes of chromite. *Tin and Tungsten: there exist deposits of these minerals in the East Baikal Area and Kazakhstan. *Borax and Potash: These minerals are exploited in great quantities in Solikamsk. The local production was 1,800,000 tonnes in 1937. The total reserves of potash are estimated at 15,000 tonnes, and magnesium stay in about 18,000,000 tonnes. In Lake Inder (central Asia) there is 30,000 tonnes. *Asbestos: This mineral was extracted in an Asbestos mine near Sverdlovsk in the Urals from 1889. The fiber is found in Peridotite, as in Quebec and Rhodesia. Other deposits exist in Altai Sayan. The Ural reserves are about 17,500,000 tonnes of fiber with more than 0.7 mm in length, so adequate for internal requirements. The USSR is in second place for production of these mineral with a yield of 100,000 tonnes. *Talc and Steatite: deposits of these minerals exist in the Urals in great quantity. *Magnesium: Apart from the sources of borax, there are also pure magnesium deposits in Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk, with production of 800,000 tonnes. *Halite (rock salt): The extractions of these element are in Solikamsk in the Urals. *Common salt: This is recovered from the Aral Sea. *Precious Stones and Gems: The Urals have many sources of these, including beryllium, amethyst, topaz, malachite, alejandrie, zirconium, etc. The Mir Mine in Mirny, Sakha Republic was the largest (by area) open pit diamond mine in the world till closure in 2012. *Mercury: Important sources are in the Urals Mountains. *Mirabilite: Sources are in the Kara-Bogaz gulf. =Coal= The existence of coal, estimated at 400,000,000,000 tonnes, was about a quarter of the Asian total, or half of the European reserves. The principal coal mining valleys and basins are: *Kuznetsk Basin *Irkutsk Valley *Minusinsk Basin *Kirguiz Steppe Valleys (Karaganda Basin) *Sakhalin Island (Alexandrovsk Valley) *Maritime Provinces *Tunguska Basin *Bureisk Valley During the interwar years, major production was in the Kuznetsk Basin; the Carboniferous Basin of Irkutsk extends joining at Transiberian railway, in 480 km, and the Maritime province near the Vladivostok area. =Petrol= Petrol is encounter on north section of Sakhalin island, and their exploitation are accord topic between Japanese and Russians. Other sources are in the Kamchatka or Ohkostk coasts, but the rest of Siberia did not promise much, with the exception of petrol pits in Central Asia or the Urals. These last (referring to the Turkestan zone) are one extension of Caucasian petrol zone and the mentioned Ural petrol sources. =Gold= Gold is often found in Siberia; currently the principal mining districts are in the Patom Highlands (Olekma-Vitim region of the Lena Valley). During the period 1910-1914, the Siberian gold mines extracted an average of 46,655 kg and employed 57,000 workers. Exploited deposits are of placer gold. The joint British Russian Company, Lena Gold Mining Joint Stock Company (Lenzoloto), owned and operated the \\"Lena Goldfields\\"  much of the region's gold production. Their mistreatment of workers ultimately led to the Lena massacre which ignited the Russian Revolution; the British shareholders secured compensation from the Soviet government in 1935. Russia remains the second biggest gold producer in the world, while using modern workplace standards. =Copper= Especially important in the Kirguises Steppes, in the Altai ranges and the Yenisei river basin. =Zinc, lead and silver= Zinc is a natural resource. =Iron= Stay more distributed and are exploited. The most important are Telbes Mine (Kuznetsk coal basin), Minusinsk, Yenisei valley, Olga territory (Maritime Province) and the Irkutsk area.

Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of the state at the centre, the study of international relations (or geopolitics) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.  History  The origins of political geography lie in the origins of human geography itself, and the early practitioners were concerned mainly with the military and political consequences of the relationships between physical geography, state territories, and state power. In particular there was a close association with both regional geography, with its focus on the unique characteristics of regions, and environmental determinism, with its emphasis on the influence of the physical environment on human activities. This association found expression in the work of the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel, who in 1897 in his book Politische Geographie, developed the concept of Lebensraum (living space) which explicitly linked the cultural growth of a nation with territorial expansion, and which was later used to provide academic legitimisation for the imperialist expansion of the German Third Reich in the 1930s. The British geographer Halford Mackinder was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history' or the Heartland Theory (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world. This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of sea power in world conflict. The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its military‚Äìindustrial complex, and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it. This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the Cold War, underpinning military thinking about the creation of buffer states between East and West in central Europe. The heartland theory depicted a world divided into a Heartland (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); World Island (Eurasia and Africa); Peripheral Islands (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and New World (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the Treaty of Versailles, where buffer states were created between the USSR and Germany, to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland. At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and Social Darwinism. He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live. Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical science, with an objective view of the world. Prior to World War II political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see Geopolitik) such as Karl Haushofer who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced Nazi political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories. The close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'. Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach. As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.  Areas of study  The Brandenburg Gate of the Berlin Wall in 1961. From the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal Political Geography Quarterly (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as Political Geography). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, Ron J. Johnston's (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, Henry Bakis (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism. However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War. With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently. Political geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life. This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)). Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched. In particular, contemporary political geography often considers: * How and why states are organized into regional groupings, both formally (e.g. the European Union) and informally (e.g. the Third World) * The relationship between states and former colonies, and how these are propagated over time, for example through neo- colonialism * The relationship between a government and its people * The relationships between states including international trades and treaties * The functions, demarcations and policing of boundaries * How imagined geographies have political implications * The influence of political power on geographical space * The political implications of modern media (e.g. radio, TV, ICT, Internet, social networks) * The study of election results (electoral geography) =Critical political geography= Critical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis- a-vis modern trends. As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from postmodern, post structural and postcolonial theories. Examples include: * Feminist geography, which argues for recognition of the power relations as patriarchal and attempts to theorise alternative conceptions of identity and identity politics. Alongside related concerns such as Queer theory and Youth studies * Postcolonial theories which recognise the Imperialistic, universalising nature of much political geography, especially in Development geography * Environmental justice which addresses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. In other words, it is a human right for all people to share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment. Notable political geographers John A.

A torque tube system is a power transmission and braking technology, that involves a stationary housing around the drive shaft, often used in automobiles with a front engine and rear drive, and rear brakes (with or without front brakes, which play no part in it). The torque tube consists of a large diameter stationary housing between the transmission and rear end that fully encloses a rotating tubular steel or small-diameter solid drive shaft that transmits the power of the engine to a regular or limited-slip differential. The purpose of a torque tube is to hold the rear end in place during acceleration and braking. Otherwise, the axle housing would suffer axle wrap, such that the front of the differential would lift up excessively during acceleration and sink down during braking. Its use is not as widespread in modern automobiles as is the Hotchkiss drive, which holds the rear end in place and prevents it from flipping up or down, during acceleration and braking, by anchoring the axle housings to the leaf springs using spring perches.  Construction  The \\"torque\\" that is referred to in the name is not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car, but that applied by the wheels. The engineering problem that the torque tube solves is how to get the traction forces generated by the wheels to the car frame. The torque moving the wheels and axles in a forward direction is met with an \\"equal and opposite\\" reaction of the axle housing and differential, making the differential want to spin in a reverse direction, in the same way that a cyclist \\"pops a wheely\\", lifting the bicycle in the air in the opposite direction from the turn of the wheel. The essential problem is how to keep the differential from rotating during acceleration and braking. The torque tube solves that problem by coupling the differential housing to the transmission housing and therefore propels the car forward by pushing up on the engine/transmission and then through the engine mounts to the car frame, with the reverse happening during braking. In contrast, the Hotchkiss drive transmits the traction forces to the car frame by using suspension components such as leaf springs or trailing arms. A type of ball and socket joint called a \\"torque ball\\" is used at one end of the torque tube to allow relative motion between the axle and transmission due to suspension travel. Later American Motors Rambler models (1962 through 1966) used a flange and cushion mount in place of the ball and socket.1962-1966 AMC Technical Service Manuals Since the torque tube does not constrain the car's body to the axle in the lateral (side-to-side) direction a panhard rod is often used for this purpose. The combination of the panhard rod and the torque tube allows the easy implementation of soft coil springs in the rear to give good ride quality, as in Buicks after 1937. Before 1937, Buicks used leaf springs, so the panhard rod was not used, though the torque tube allowed a cantilever spring suspension, which gives a softer ride than a center-mount axle on the leaf spring, as required by the Hotchkiss setup. In addition to transmitting traction forces, the torque tube is hollow and contains the rotating driveshaft. Inside the hollow torque ball is the universal joint of the driveshaft that allows relative motion between the two ends of the driveshaft. In most applications the drive shaft uses a single universal joint which has the disadvantage that it causes speed fluctuations in the driveshaft when the shaft is not straight. The Hotchkiss drive uses two universal joints, which has the effect of canceling the speed fluctuations and gives a constant speed even when the shaft is no longer straight . V8-powered models of the 1963-1966 AMC Rambler used a double-Cardan constant velocity joint to eliminate driveshaft fluctuations, though six-cylinder and earlier V8 models used only one standard universal joint.1963-1966 AMC Technical Service Manuals. The torque tube design is typically heavier and securely ties the rear end together, thus providing for a rigid rear end and assuring good alignment under all conditions. However, because of the greater unsprung weight of the torque tube and radius rods, there may be a \\"little hopping around of the rear end when cornering fast or on washboard roads\\".  Application  Examples of the torque tube were the American cars of the Ford brand up through 1948, including over 19,000,000 Model Ts. Ford used the less expensive transverse springs that could not take forward thrust. For many of those years, Chevrolet used the torque tube, while Buick used it starting in 1906 (in the model D).\\"Buick, The Golden Era\\" by Prof. Francis Therou\\"Seventy Years of Buick\\" by George H. Damman, page 18 \\"Buick pioneered the torque tube this year\\" referring to the model D built in 1906. The torque tube also allowed Buick, beginning in 1938, to use coil springs for a softer ride than traditional leaf springs, which can use a Hotchkiss drive, but coil springs cannot. Buick's use of a torque tube and coil springs became a Buick \\"engineering trademark\\", until it was dropped with the 1961 model year full-sized models. The Nash 600 model adopted torque-tube drive in 1941 without an enclosed joint, but utilized a \\"horizontal yoke at the front end of the torque tube is supported by rubber biscuits at each side.\\" After the merger of Nash and Hudson in 1954, American Motors Corporation (AMC) continued to use the coil spring and torque tube rear suspension design on their large-sized cars (Rambler Classic and Ambassador) from the 1956 through the 1966 model year. The enclosed driveshaft made for more complicated gear swaps and hampered hot rodders. The discontinued torque-tube drive was replaced by a completely new open driveshaft and four-link axle-location system. The Peugeot 403 and 404 models used a torque tube. The Peugeot 504, and Peugeot 505 estate/station wagons, as well as most export-market sedans also had torque tubes, while domestic and European-market sedan models had a transaxle and individual rear suspension. The Chevrolet Chevette (1976-1988) and the similar Pontiac T-1000 used a torque tube and center bearing. This design was unlike any other Chevrolet model \\"to isolate impacts to the rear wheels, cut down on road noise, and reduce engine vibration ... also allows a reduction in the height of the drive shaft and tunnel.\\" The continuing limited production of the Avanti switched to a new chassis in 1986 that utilized a torque tube along with an independent rear suspension. The Mercedes SLS has a torque tube, but only to align the transaxle with the engine. Since 1996 the Chevrolet Corvette has used a torque tube since the introduction of the C5 version in the 1997 model year.

In a typical example the player heads upcourt, dribbling the ball in (say) the left hand, then makes a wide step left with a good head fake. If the defender is deceived, the player can then switch to dribbling with the right hand and surpass the defender. The crossover can allow the player an open short jumper or a clear path to the basket. The following are a few types of crossovers: * Normal crossover: In a normal crossover, the player quickly changes direction while switching the ball to the opposite hand. This move relies primarily on speed. Basketball analysts have cited Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook to be perfectionists at this certain crossover. In this crossover there isn't a big fake, instead you simply move one direction, and use the crossover to make an abrupt change of direction.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxoTzyvUO0s * \\"In and Out\\": This move has the ball handler feint a crossover in one direction then continue towards his original direction. A variation of this move may include the player doing a normal crossover after a hesitation to cause further difficulty for the defensive player. * Killer crossover (aka Ankle-snatcher, Ankle- breaker, etc): In this move the player fakes in one direction, generally with a wide step and a head fake and usually from a standstill. The player then switches the dribble to the other hand between his/her legs and moves in that direction. This is one of the most effective methods of escaping a defender who is guarding closely. It is also popular in streetball because it can cause the defender to lose balance and fall in trying to react too quickly. Tim Hardaway was known for his version of this move calling it the \\"UTEP Two- step\\". He would go between the legs and fake one direction, then quickly change directions with a crossover. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZQtCXs30k * Behind the back crossover: Behind the back crossover is the same as the usual crossover except the ball is dribbled behind the player. Another version of this move is called the \\"wraparound,\\" in which the player cups the ball in his hand and brings it around his back to the other side of his body in one quick, smooth motion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPBG2LD4n4 Jamal Crawford is known for this move. * Double crossover: This move can be considered a feigned crossover. The offensive player crosses the ball over (as with a normal or killer crossover) then quickly crosses the ball back to its original position. The double crossover is not aimed at breaking free of the defender so much as causing confusion and breaking the defender's balance. This move can also be replicated going between the legs or behind the back. Allen Iverson popularized this move in the early 2000s. * Shammgod: A type of crossover dribble where the offensive player bounces the ball forward to a very risky position on one side of his body, then uses the opposite hand to bring the ball back to the other side of his body. Named after streetball and college star (and current Dallas Mavericks assistant coach) God Shammgod. Known users of this move include Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Kyrie Irving, and Jamal Crawford in the NBA; and in international basketball, Dejan Bodiroga of Croatia and Terrence Romeo of the Philippines. The original crossover move has been used by all five positions on the court, but particularly by point and shooting guards. The first crossover was seen in a street basketball game at the Rucker Park by the street legend Richard (Rick) \\"Pee Wee\\" Kirkland. Oscar Robertson was known to do the move as early as the 1960s as well as Dwayne Washington while playing for Syracuse during the early 1980s, but Tim Hardaway is credited for popularizing the killer crossover in the NBA, while Allen Iverson and Steve Francis popularized the double crossover.

Life Archbishop Karekin was born Petros Kazancƒ±yan in 1927 in Istanbul. Young Petros attended Levon Vartuhiyan School in Topkapƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul and then the Bezaziyan and Getronagan schools. In October 1940 he was accepted as a seminarian in the Patriarchal Seminary of the St. James Brotherhood in Jerusalem. In 1945 he was ordained a deacon and on January 22, 1950, he was elevated to the priesthood by Archbishop Mampre Sirounian, the Primate of Egypt. From 1946 to 1949, Father Karekin was the Assistant Dean of the Seminary of Jerusalem; he also taught at the Seminary as well as at the Tarkman√ßats School until 1951. For two years, he was the Chancellor of the Holy See of Jerusalem, the second Chairman of the General Assembly of the Brotherhood, and also a member of the Executive Council. Responding to an invitation by Archbishop Karekin Khachadourian, Patriarch of the Armenians in Turkey, Father Karekin returned to Istanbul in December 1951 to accept the position of Dean of the planned Holy Cross Seminary. Until the formal opening of the Seminary, which took place in January 1954, he taught at the Getronagan and Bezjian secondary schools and served as the Dean of classes for the preparation of priests at the Patriarchate. On the day of the opening of the Holy Cross Seminary, he received the rank of Dzayrakuyn Vartabed, supreme doctorate of Christian dogma, from Patriarch Karekin I. At this institution, he continued to teach classical and modern Armenian literature and served as Dean until July 1959. In December 1959, he went to the United States and accepted the position of pastor of St. Mary Church in Washington, D.C. On October 24, 1966 he was ordained Bishop by Catholicos Vazken I, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians. From the Washington, DC parish he went to Australia as the first primate of that newly established diocese, where he presided until March 1981, when he was elected to the position of Grand Sacristan of the Brotherhood of St. James in Jerusalem. Bishop Karekin's thesis for the rank of Vartabedutyun was \\"Four Minor Prophets\\", which was published in the 1950‚Äì1951 issues of the monthly Sion, the official newsletter of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. His thesis for the rank of Dzayrakooyn Vartabed, was \\"The Encyclicals of St. Nersess Shnorhali\\", which he translated into modern Armenian with commentary. Bishop Karekin published religious and literary articles in several journals such as Dziadzan, Sion, Hayasdanyayts Yegeghetsi, Nor Ashkharh, and Marmara. Through his efforts, a beautiful Armenian church was built in Washington, D.C. in 1962. Bishop Karekin was also instrumental in the construction of a new church in Sydney, Australia in 1972 and in Melbourne in 1976. During his tenure of office, a beautiful and magnificent building was purchased in Sydney to serve as headquarters of the Diocese of Australia. He exerted much effort to alleviate the mortgage on these buildings. From 1981 to September 5, 1990, he was the Grand Sacristan of the Holy See of Jerusalem. Since 1981 he was elected to serve on a committee that audited the finances of the Monastery and with three other people he was in charge of the possessions of the Monastery. During that time he also taught the senior students of the Seminary. Archbishop Karekin Kazancƒ±yan was elevated to the position of Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople in September 1990. Death On March 10, 1998, Archbishop Karekin Kazancƒ±yan died at the Surp Pƒ±rgƒ±√ß (Holy Saviour) Armenian hospital in Istanbul. He was 70 years of age.

Damage to the nerve may be the result of surgery (e.g., thyroidectomy) or a tumor. Aphonia means \\"no sound\\". In other words, a person with this disorder has lost their voice. Causes Injuries are often the cause of aphonia . Minor injuries can affect the second and third dorsal area in such a manner that the lymph patches concerned with coordination become either atrophic or relatively nonfunctioning. Tracheotomy can also cause aphonia. Any injury or condition that prevents the vocal cords, the paired bands of muscle tissue positioned over the trachea, from coming together and vibrating will have the potential to make a person unable to speak. When a person prepares to speak, the vocal folds come together over the trachea and vibrate due to the airflow from the lungs. This mechanism produces the sound of the voice. If the vocal folds cannot meet together to vibrate, sound will not be produced. Aphonia can also be caused by and is often accompanied by fear. =Psychogenic= Psychogenic aphonia is often seen in patients with underlying psychological problems. Laryngeal examination will usually show bowed vocal folds that fail to adduct to the midline during phonation. However, the vocal folds will adduct when the patient is asked to cough. Treatment should involve consultation and counseling with a speech pathologist and, if necessary, a psychologist. In this case, the patient's history and the observed unilateral immobility rules out function aphonia.

RAF Andover Crest RAF Andover is a former Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force station located west of Andover, Hampshire and north east of Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. The airfield has a notable place in history, being the site of both the first attempt to develop a viable long-range electronic navigation system, during the First World War, and also of the first British military helicopter unit and first European helicopter flying training school, during the Second World War. RAF Andover was also used before and after the Second World War for a variety of other aeronautical research and flight testing. The RAF Staff College, Andover was founded here in 1922, the first college to train officers in the administrative, staff and policy aspects of running an air force. RAF Andover saw action during the Second World War. Corporal Josephine Robins, one of only six members of the WAAF to win the Military Medal during the War, won her award for courage while rescuing people during an air-raid on the airfield in the Battle of Britain. Three squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force were formed at RAF Andover. Before and during the Battle of Normandy, RAF Andover was used by the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force as an operational tactical fighter airfield. It was also known as USAAF Station 406, Pundit Code AV. The code AV was broadcast in morse code by a mobile red light beacon at night, during the latter part of the War. The code was also painted on the airfield hangar nearest to the control tower, and remained visible until the hangars were demolished in 2001. The site was redeveloped, and in 2009 part of it became Marlborough Lines, home to the Headquarters of the British Army. Airfield history =Between 2100 BC and AD 1912= The earliest known human activity on the site of Andover Airfield took place in the Bronze Age, according to archaeological evidence, which has uncovered significant Iron Age and later activity, including both an Anglo-Saxon and medieval cemeteries. Military activity on the site is certainly established with the construction during or shortly after 43 AD of the Portway (called on Andover Airfield Monxton Road) Roman Road from Silchester (Calleva) to Old Sarum (Sorviodvnvm), which just north of the Airfield meets at East Anton Crossroads the Roman Road (Icknield Way) from Winchester (Venta) to Mildenhall (Cvnetio). The Andover sections of these roads were constructed by the Legio II Augusta Roman Legion. Handley Page O/400 lands at RAF Andover, 1918 =1912 to 1918= The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) opened a station near Andover in August 1917 during the First World War. The station was mainly built by German prisoners of war, some of whom left their signatures in roof spaces of buildings on the station. It is close to the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre at Amport House and the Army Air Corps Centre at Middle Wallop. Plans for an RFC \\"Training Depot Station\\" on the airfield site had originally been made in 1912. The station motto was Vis et armis consilioque orta (). This is appropriate as the station was built as a Training Depot for aircrews, who had completed basic flying training, to learn to fly the Handley Page Type O and Airco D.H. 9 bombers. The first unit to occupy the station was No. 2 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping. This unit took up residence while the station was still under construction. Amongst squadrons formed at Andover was 106 Squadron, formed on 30 September 1917, who were equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 reconnaissance aircraft for army co-operation duties, being posted to Ireland in May 1918. Also, from 24 December 1917 to 6 June 1918 Andover was host to a detachment of the 13th Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. In early 1918 experiments were conducted with Handley Page Type O bombers, based at Andover and Cranwell, fitted with Radio Direction-Finding (RDF as it was called) equipment for night flying. The intention was to guide British bombers to and from Berlin, and early results led to 550 sets of RDF equipment being ordered by the United States Army Air Service, but the First World War ended before any attempts could be made to use the system operationally. This was the first attempt to develop a viable long-range electronic navigation system, of a kind that is today used routinely worldwide. =1918 to 1939= Between the wars, the airfield housed a number of RAF units, including from 1919 the RAF School of Navigation, as No. 2 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping was retitled. The RAF Staff College was founded here on 1 April 1922, to provide staff training to selected officers, and eventually moved to the Bracknell in 1970. The formation of the Royal Air Forces Association followed a conversation in 1929 in the Sergeants‚Äô Mess of RAF Andover. RAF Andover continued to be used for a variety of aeronautical research and flight testing. As part of this, several experimental military aircraft made their first flights from the airfield. Amongst them were: the Westland Yeovil; the Westland Witch; the Westland F.7/30; and all of the Westland-Hill Pterodactyl series of experimental flying wing aircraft. Two experimental bomber squadrons were also based at RAF Andover in the late 1920s and early 1930s, No. 12 Squadron RAF and No. 101 Squadron RAF. 12 Squadron was based at RAF Andover from March 1924, operating Fairey Fawn light bombers. No. 13 Squadron was also based here for five years between 1924 and 1929, operating Armstrong Whitworth Atlas aircraft. Fairey Fox VI The Fairey Fox bombers of No. 12 Squadron was one of the two experimental bomber squadrons based on the station, these aircraft being significantly faster than all other contemporary fighters and bombers. To this day, 12 Squadron's official unit motto 'Leads the Field' and crest commemorates their time at RAF Andover by depicting the head of a Fox. The Fairey Fox was the first all metal aircraft in operational service and 12 Squadron was the only squadron to operate it. The aircraft was a private venture by Fairey, which had been demonstrated to the Squadron secretly during an 'At Home' at RAF Andover in 1925, when the Fox appeared in Royal Air Force markings and 12 Squadron colours. During the Air Defence of Great Britain exercise in 1928, the Squadron was tasked with the simulated bombing of London. To commemorate 12 Squadron's success in the exercise, the Commander in Chief of the Royal Air Force chose a Fox's face as the Squadron emblem. A typical annual training programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual training in the autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of parachutes for aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would climb out of the aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000 ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the ripcord was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants. In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested. The Hawker Hind was derived from the Hawker Hart. This Hind is a flying example in the Shuttleworth Collection The Foxes were replaced in January 1931 with the Hawker Hart, after which much work was put into formation flying in cloud, instrument flying, pattern bombing and aircraft icing trials. The purpose of these trials was to enable Royal Air Force aircraft to bomb an enemy ship successfully, regardless of weather. To this end, 12 Squadron dropped several practice bombs on an obsolete battleship, HMS Centurion, which was a radio-controlled target off the south coast. On 6 July 1935, King George V performed the first Royal Review of the Royal Air Force, in which 12(B) Squadron led the Light Bomber Wing flypast at RAF Mildenhall. Several home-based squadrons, including 12 Squadron, were re- deployed in October 1935, to the Middle East and Aden in preparation for action being taken by the League of Nations against Italy for invading Abyssinia. 12 Squadron returned to RAF Andover in August 1936, and on its return took delivery of the Hawker Hind. It was around this time that the majority of B Flight were taken to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 63 Squadron. In February 1938, the Squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Battles, the squadron leaving RAF Andover in May 1939. A Boulton-Paul Sidestrand of No. 101 Squadron RAF In October 1929 No. 101 Squadron, the second experimental bomber squadron, was also posted to RAF Andover, to enable its Boulton-Paul Sidestrand bombers to work alongside 12 Squadron with its Fairey Fox light bombers. The high performance of the Sidestrand amazed crowds at the Hendon Air Pageants, where it flew mock combat aerobatics with the fighters of the day. 101 Squadron Sidestrands won a number of bombing and reconnaissance competitions and carried out trial anti-shipping strikes against Royal Navy battleships. In December 1934 the squadron left RAF Andover. =1939 to 1945= During the Second World War, RAF Andover was the headquarters of RAF Maintenance Command. It was also used by several operational flying training units and as an operational fighter station by the United States Army Air Forces. The Air Transport Auxiliary's (ATA) Central Ferry Control was also based at RAF Andover. A civilian organisation that unusually for the time included female pilots, the ATA ferried new, repaired and damaged military aircraft between factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, Maintenance Units (MUs), scrap yards, and active service squadrons and airfields. Central Ferry Control allocated the required flights to all ATA Ferry Pools. RAF Andover was one of four airfields in Hampshire to be given a decoy site in 1940, to deceive enemy aircraft into attacking a spurious target. Andover's decoy site was at Hurstbourne Tarrant, and was a type 'K' decoy site with fake aircraft and buildings. From September 1940, fake machine gun posts were added to Hurstbourne Tarrant. Corporal Josephine Robins, MM, WAAF, painted in 1941 by the artist Laura Knight. RAF Andover was attacked twice by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. At 1700 hours on 13 August 1940, approximately 12 high explosive bombs were dropped by Junkers Ju 88s of III Staffel, Lehrgeschwader 1, of Luftflotte 3, from Ch√¢teaudun in France. The Station Headquarters and officer's quarters were extensively damaged. One aircraft on the station was also damaged. Casualties were two killed. The following day, on 14 August 1940, RAF Andover was attacked again, about 15 high explosive bombs being dropped which destroyed a transmitting set in the centre of a group of radio masts, and killing a civilian radio operator. Corporal Josephine Robins, a Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) telephone operator at RAF Andover was awarded the Military Medal for her courage during these raids. The citation for the award, printed in The London Gazette of 20 December 1940, stated that: \\"Corporal Robins was in a dug-out which received a direct hit during an intense enemy bombing raid. A number of men were killed and two seriously injured. Though dust and fumes filled the shelter, Corporal Robins immediately went to the assistance of the wounded and rendered first aid. While they were being removed from the demolished dug-out, she fetched a stretcher and stayed with the wounded until they were evacuated.

Corporal Robins' Military Medal was one of only six such awards of this medal made to members of the WAAF in the entire Second World War. A captured Bf 110 G-4 night fighter once based at RAF Andover, now in the RAF Museum. It was thought at the time that these air raids were attempts to attack the important 11 Group Fighter Command Sector Station nearby at RAF Middle Wallop, but German records make it clear that RAF Andover was the intended target, as the Luftwaffe thought wrongly that it was an operational bomber station. In 1941 RAF Andover was attacked twice, causing heavy damage to one hangar, which had to be demolished. In June 1941 No. 2 School of Army Co-operation at Andover was re-designated as No. 6 Operational Training Unit (OTU). It was equipped with Bristol Blenheims and operated within No. 17 Group, Coastal Command. Its task was to re-train Westland Lysander pilots onto Bristol Blenheim Mk. Vs used in the ground attack role, serving primarily in the used primarily in the Middle East and Far East. No 6 OTU was absorbed into No. 42 OTU on 18 July 1941, moving to RAF Ashbourne in October 1942. D-Day campaign. From February through July 1944, Andover was used by fighter squadrons (the 401st, 402nd, and 485th squadrons of the 370th Fighter Group) of the 71st Fighter Wing of the Ninth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces, flying Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft. Flying from RAF Andover, the 370th dive-bombed radar installations and flak towers, and escorted bombers that attacked bridges and marshalling yards in France as the Allies prepared for the invasion of the Continent. The 370th also provided cover for Allied forces that crossed the English Channel on D-Day and flew armed reconnaissance missions over the Cotentin Peninsula until the end of the month. The 370th Fighter Group moved to their Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Cardonville, France (ALG A-3) on 20 July. The USAAF lost a total of 31 P-38s from Andover before the move to France.

V Three Canadian Army Air Observation Post (AOP) Squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force, No. 664 Squadron RCAF, No. 665 Squadron RCAF, and No. 666 Squadron RCAF were formed at RAF Andover between 9 December 1944 and 5 March 1945. The Canadian squadrons were equipped with Auster Mark IV and V aircraft. The pilots and observers in the squadrons were officers recruited from the Royal Canadian Artillery and O.R.s from the Royal Canadian Artillery and Royal Canadian Air Force. The pilots were trained to fly de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft at No. 22 Elementary Flying Training School RAF (Cambridge); thereafter, successful candidates were further trained at No. 43 Operational Training Unit, the AOP School based at RAF Andover dedicated to training British and Commonwealth AOP flight-crews. Lieutenant-Colonel Terry Willett, Royal Artillery, commanded No. 43 OTU at RAF Andover as the first officer to command the AOP training organisation. Among the Canadian students trained by No. 43 Operational Training Unit at RAF Andover for No. 666 Squadron RCAF was Captain James Doohan, who later achieved fame as an actor playing Star Trek‚Äôs Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Scott. While under training he flew an Auster Mark IV between two telegraph poles on Salisbury Plain, to prove it could be done. British Army AOP training at RAF Andover, with Auster Mark V aircraft, continued until at least 1949. One of the three squadrons was re-established after the war as 665 Squadron, Army Air Corps, based in Northern Ireland. Sikorsky R-4B at National Museum of the United States Air Force RAF Andover has a unique place in British history, as the first British military unit to be equipped with helicopters, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 as part of 43 OTU under the command of Squadron Leader B.H. Arkell. This was also the first European helicopter flying-training school, however the first European military unit formed solely with helicopters was the Luftwaffe's Transportstaffel 40 in 1944. The Helicopter Training School was equipped with nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I helicopters, and trained 100 British Army pilots for Air Observation Post duties, as well as pilots for the first RAF squadron to be equipped with helicopters, 529 Squadron, which carried our radar calibration duties. Radar calibration duties were later carried out by the Hawker Siddeley Andover and Air Observation Post duties are today carried out by the Army Air Corps. A reminder of the Second World War on the former Airfield is a headstone on the North Site marking the grave of Jane, an RAF Police guard dog. =1945 to the present day= Post-war, RAF Andover continued to be used for helicopter flying training and operational research, C Flight of 657 Squadron, Army Air Corps, being renamed 1901 Flight in February 1947. The Flight used six Sikorsky R-6A Hoverfly 2 (an improved version of the Hoverfly I) helicopters, and Auster AOP.6 aircraft to train British Army and Royal Air Force pilots and carry out operational trials. The Hoverfly 2s had little effective operational capability, but gave the Army valuable experience in the helicopter's potential use. In addition to artillery direction, the Flight's experimental activities included photography, radar trials, air/ground communications, and fighter evasion. In January 1948, the Flight moved to Middle Wallop. It still exists today as 1 Flight, Army Air Corps. On 14 September 1955, RAF Andover was honoured with the freedom of the Borough of Andover. No. 12 Squadron RAF took part in the ceremony with a flypast of its English Electric Canberra B Mk. 6 bombers, to mark the Squadron's pre-war association with RAF Andover. Andover continued its association with pioneering the use of helicopters in Britain when the Joint Helicopter Unit, which was a joint Royal Navy, Army Air Corps and Royal Air Force unit exploring operational helicopter roles, was based at the station from 1958 to 1959. The unit used Westland Whirlwind helicopters and was disbanded at the end of 1959 to form No. 225 Squadron RAF. The Hawker P.1127 The station's association with aviation research continued, as trials of the Hawker P.1127, the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA 1 (both were experimental vertical take-off aircraft), and the Hawker Siddeley Harrier partially took place on the station. The Harrier was the developed form of the P.1127 and Kestrel and was the world's first operational vertical/short take- off and landing aircraft. A Hawker Siddeley Andover C1. Trials of the Hawker Siddeley Andover (the second RAF aircraft of that name) were also partially carried out at RAF Andover. In commemoration of this, Hawker Siddeley presented the Borough of Andover with a framed photo of the aircraft, and the type was also named after RAF Andover. The Andover's main role in RAF service was tactical transport, for which its unique ability to \\"kneel\\" ‚Äì to allow vehicle entry at a shallow angle via a rear ramp ‚Äì was an asset. Other roles included aero-medical evacuation, STOL, and parachute and 1 ton container drops. The Andover could also be fitted with long-range ferry tanks, which enabled the short-range Andover to fly surprisingly long distances, such as across the Atlantic Ocean. Andovers were still in RAF service for the photo reconnaissance role under the Open Skies Treaty and for use by the Empire Test Pilots' School until 2012. A Percival Pembroke of No. 21 Squadron RAF RAF Andover was throughout the post-1945 period the home of a number of communications squadrons, the last one of which was No. 21 Squadron RAF, which used de Havilland Devon and Percival Pembroke aircraft. This was formed on 3 February 1969, when the Western Communication Squadron RAF was re-designated at RAF Andover. It provided transport for senior officers in the western part of the United Kingdom and was disbanded following defence cuts on 31 March 1976. The RAF station was closed on 10 June 1977 and the airfield was handed over to the British Army. It is in use by Army Air Corps units based at Middle Wallop, as well as Defence Equipment & Support (formerly the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO)). The last RAF personnel working in these units left in November 2009. However, the airfield still retains an RAF link through the presence of 1213 (Andover) Squadron, Air Training Corps. The RAF Museum preserves a number of individual aircraft which were based at RAF Andover during their service lives: a Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I; an Avro Anson C. 19; a De Havilland Dove C. 1; a Percival Pembroke C. 2; and, unusually, two Luftwaffe aircraft captured in 1944, a Junkers Ju 87 G-2 dive bomber and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 G-4 night fighter. The National Museum of Flight in Scotland preserves RAF Andover's former gate guardian, a Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. XVIE. The following units were here at some point: =The RAF Staff College= The RAF Staff College was founded at RAF Andover on 1 April 1922, to provide staff training to selected officers, usually of Flight Lieutenant or Squadron Leader rank to enable them to undertake staff officer duties at the Air Ministry, and Command or Group HQs. It was closed on the day that Britain declared war, 3 September 1939. But in November 1939, shortened courses were restarted until the College was placed under Care and Maintenance on 28 May 1940. The Staff College re-opened at Bulstrode Park in December 1941, the College returning to Andover in 1948. It was raised to Group status within Training Command on 1 June 1968 and eventually moved to Bracknell in 1970. Redevelopment In 2007, the site of Andover Airfield became the focus of local controversy when developers submitted a planning proposal to build a large distribution centre for the Tesco supermarket company.Planning Application According to the proposal, the main building would have been more than 85,000 sq metres (21 acres), which would make it one of the biggest buildings in Europe. Approval was granted in 2008 but the developer failed to reach agreement with Tesco; a regional distribution centre for the Co-op Group was built instead, and the rest of the site became a business park. To mark the closure of the airfield for the redevelopment a sculpture by Chris Brammall, entitled Flight and Navigation, was unveiled on 6 October 2014. It features aircraft that flew from the airfield, and was unveiled with the last RAF flag to fly from the airfield when it was an RAF station. The flag had been kept by local Councillor Ian Carr, who was a navigator with No. 21 Squadron RAF flying de Havilland Devons from the airfield. =Marlborough Lines= From November 2009, a site on the former airfield was named Marlborough Lines and subsequently became home to the Army Headquarters.

Earlier attempts at a unifying definition of quantum groups using, for example, multiplicative unitaries have enjoyed some success but have also encountered several technical problems. One of the main features distinguishing this new approach from its predecessors is the axiomatic existence of left and right invariant weights. This gives a noncommutative analogue of left and right Haar measures on a locally compact Hausdorff group.  Definitions  Before we can even begin to properly define a locally compact quantum group, we first need to define a number of preliminary concepts and also state a few theorems. Definition (weight). Let A be a C*-algebra, and let A_{\\\\geq 0} denote the set of positive elements of A . A weight on A is a function \\\\phi: A_{\\\\geq 0} \\\\to [0,\\\\infty] such that * \\\\phi(a_{1} + a_{2}) = \\\\phi(a_{1}) + \\\\phi(a_{2}) for all a_{1},a_{2} \\\\in A_{\\\\geq 0} , and * \\\\phi(r \\\\cdot a) = r \\\\cdot \\\\phi(a) for all r \\\\in [0,\\\\infty) and a \\\\in A_{\\\\geq 0} . Some notation for weights. Let \\\\phi be a weight on a C*-algebra A . We use the following notation: * \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}^{+} := \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A_{\\\\geq 0} \\\\mid \\\\phi(a) < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} , which is called the set of all positive \\\\phi -integrable elements of A . * \\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\phi} := \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A \\\\mid \\\\phi(a^{*} a) < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} , which is called the set of all \\\\phi -square-integrable elements of A . * \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi} := \\\\text{Span} ~ \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}^{+} = \\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\phi}^{*} \\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\phi} , which is called the set of all \\\\phi -integrable elements of A . Types of weights. Let \\\\phi be a weight on a C*-algebra A . * We say that \\\\phi is faithful if and only if \\\\phi(a) eq 0 for each non-zero a \\\\in A_{\\\\geq 0} . * We say that \\\\phi is lower semi-continuous if and only if the set \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A_{\\\\geq 0} \\\\mid \\\\phi(a) \\\\leq \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\} is a closed subset of A for every \\\\lambda \\\\in [0,\\\\infty] . * We say that \\\\phi is densely defined if and only if \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}^{+} is a dense subset of A_{\\\\geq 0} , or equivalently, if and only if either \\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\phi} or \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi} is a dense subset of A . * We say that \\\\phi is proper if and only if it is non-zero, lower semi-continuous and densely defined. Definition (one-parameter group). Let A be a C*-algebra. A one-parameter group on A is a family \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}} of *-automorphisms of A that satisfies \\\\alpha_{s} \\\\circ \\\\alpha_{t} = \\\\alpha_{s + t} for all s,t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} . We say that \\\\alpha is norm-continuous if and only if for every a \\\\in A , the mapping \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to A defined by t \\\\mapsto {\\\\alpha_{t}}(a) is continuous. Definition (analytic extension of a one-parameter group). Given a norm-continuous one- parameter group \\\\alpha on a C*-algebra A , we are going to define an analytic extension of \\\\alpha . For each z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} , let : I(z) := \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mid \\\\Im(y) \\\\leq \\\\Im(z) \\\\\\\\} , which is a horizontal strip in the complex plane. We call a function f: I(z) \\\\to A norm-regular if and only if the following conditions hold: * It is analytic on the interior of I(z) , i.e., for each y_{0} in the interior of I(z) , the limit \\\\displaystyle \\\\lim_{y \\\\to y_{0}} \\\\frac{f(y) - f(y_{0})}{y - y_{0}} exists with respect to the norm topology on A . * It is norm-bounded on I(z) . * It is norm-continuous on I(z) . Suppose now that z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\mathbb{R} , and let : D_{z} := \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A \\\\mid \\\\text{There exists a norm- regular} ~ f: I(z) \\\\to A ~ \\\\text{such that} ~ f(t) = {\\\\alpha_{t}}(a) ~ \\\\text{for all} ~ t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\\\\\}. Define \\\\alpha_{z}: D_{z} \\\\to A by {\\\\alpha_{z}}(a) := f(z) . The function f is uniquely determined (by the theory of complex-analytic functions), so \\\\alpha_{z} is well-defined indeed. The family (\\\\alpha_{z})_{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}} is then called the analytic extension of \\\\alpha . Theorem 1. The set \\\\cap_{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}} D_{z} , called the set of analytic elements of A , is a dense subset of A . Definition (K.M.S. weight). Let A be a C*-algebra and \\\\phi: A_{\\\\geq 0} \\\\to [0,\\\\infty] a weight on A . We say that \\\\phi is a K.M.S. weight ('K.M.S.' stands for 'Kubo-Martin-Schwinger') on A if and only if \\\\phi is a proper weight on A and there exists a norm-continuous one-parameter group (\\\\sigma_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}} on A such that * \\\\phi is invariant under \\\\sigma , i.e., \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\sigma_{t} = \\\\phi for all t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} , and * for every a \\\\in \\\\text{Dom}(\\\\sigma_{i / 2}) , we have \\\\phi(a^{*} a) = \\\\phi(\\\\sigma_{i / 2}(a) [\\\\sigma_{i / 2}(a)]^{*}) . We denote by M(A) the multiplier algebra of A. Theorem 2. If A and B are C*-algebras and \\\\pi: A \\\\to M(B) is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism (i.e., \\\\pi[A] B is a dense subset of B ), then we can uniquely extend \\\\pi to a *-homomorphism \\\\overline{\\\\pi}: M(A) \\\\to M(B) . Theorem 3. If \\\\omega: A \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} is a state (i.e., a positive linear functional of norm 1 ) on A , then we can uniquely extend \\\\omega to a state \\\\overline{\\\\omega}: M(A) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} on M(A) . Definition (Locally compact quantum group). A (C*-algebraic) locally compact quantum group is an ordered pair \\\\mathcal{G} = (A,\\\\Delta) , where A is a C*-algebra and \\\\Delta: A \\\\to M(A \\\\otimes A) is a non- degenerate *-homomorphism called the co-multiplication, that satisfies the following four conditions: * The co-multiplication is co-associative, i.e., \\\\overline{\\\\Delta \\\\otimes \\\\iota} \\\\circ \\\\Delta = \\\\overline{\\\\iota \\\\otimes \\\\Delta} \\\\circ \\\\Delta . * The sets \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\overline{\\\\omega \\\\otimes \\\\text{id}}(\\\\Delta(a)) ~ \\\\big ~ \\\\omega \\\\in A^{*}, ~ a \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\overline{\\\\text{id} \\\\otimes \\\\omega}(\\\\Delta(a)) ~ \\\\big ~ \\\\omega \\\\in A^{*}, ~ a \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} are linearly dense subsets of A . * There exists a faithful K.M.S. weight \\\\phi on A that is left-invariant, i.e., \\\\phi \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\overline{\\\\omega \\\\otimes \\\\text{id}}(\\\\Delta(a)) \\\\right) = \\\\overline{\\\\omega}(1_{M(A)}) \\\\cdot \\\\phi(a) for all \\\\omega \\\\in A^{*} and a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}^{+} . * There exists a K.M.S. weight \\\\psi on A that is right-invariant, i.e., \\\\psi \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\overline{\\\\text{id} \\\\otimes \\\\omega}(\\\\Delta(a)) \\\\right) = \\\\overline{\\\\omega}(1_{M(A)}) \\\\cdot \\\\psi(a) for all \\\\omega \\\\in A^{*} and a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\phi}^{+} . From the definition of a locally compact quantum group, it can be shown that the right-invariant K.M.S. weight \\\\psi is automatically faithful. Therefore, the faithfulness of \\\\psi is a redundant condition and does not need to be postulated.  Duality  The category of locally compact quantum groups allows for a dual construction with which one can prove that the bi-dual of a locally compact quantum group is isomorphic to the original one. This result gives a far- reaching generalization of Pontryagin duality for locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups.  Alternative formulations  The theory has an equivalent formulation in terms of von Neumann algebras.

He was Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy in London, and an important collector and scholar of Japanese art. He was the first chairman of the Japan Society. In 1881, the British Museum acquired over 2000 Japanese and Chinese paintings from Anderson, ensuring that it had (and still has) one of the largest such collections in its field in Europe.British Museum Collection The genetic disorder Anderson-Fabry disease is named after him. Life Anderson was educated at the City of London School, the Lambeth School of Art (where he was awarded a medal for artistic anatomy) and St Thomas's Hospital (where he also won numerous prizes). He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1869. At St Thomas's Hospital, he was in 1871 appointed surgical registrar and assistant demonstrator of anatomy. In 1873, he moved to Tokyo, Japan, where he was professor of anatomy and surgery at the Imperial Naval Medical College, and gave lectures both in English and in Japanese, which he learned for that purpose. Here, he assembled his collections and began his study of Japanese art. He was eventually, in 1895, appointed as a knight commander of the Japanese order of the Rising Sun. He returned to St Thomas's Hospital in London in 1880, and eventually became senior lecturer on anatomy. He was elected professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy in 1891. He published the first description of the genetic disorder that later became known as Anderson- Fabry disease. He was twice married. Collecting Between 1882 and 1900, Anderson donated his collection of approximately 2000 Japanese illustrated woodcut books to what is now the British Library.

It is often used to convey power to the wheels of a vehicle, particularly bicycles and motorcycles. It is also used in a wide variety of machines besides vehicles. Most often, the power is conveyed by a roller chain, known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with the teeth of the gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another type of drive chain is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth. Sometimes the power is output by simply rotating the chain, which can be used to lift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and the power is recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though drive chains are often simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than two gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or transmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of the input and output gears with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be altered. For example, when the bicycle pedals' gear rotate once, it causes the gear that drives the wheels to rotate more than one revolution. History The oldest known illustration of an endless power-transmitting chain drive, from Su Song's book of 1092 AD, describing his clock tower of Kaifeng Sketch of pin-jointed chain by Leonardo da Vinci The oldest known application of a chain drive appears in the Polybolos, described by the Greek engineer Philon of Byzantium (3rd century BC). Two flat-linked chains were connected to a windlass, which by winding back and forth would automatically fire the machine's arrows until its magazine was empty.Werner Soedel, Vernard Foley: Ancient Catapults, Scientific American, Vol. 240, No. 3 (March 1979), p.124-125 Although the device did not transmit power continuously since the chains \\"did not transmit power from shaft to shaft, and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper\\",Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Cave Books, Ltd. Page 109. the Greek design marks the beginning of the history of the chain drive since \\"no earlier instance of such a cam is known, and none as complex is known until the 16th century.\\" It is here that the flat-link chain, often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci,In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci made sketches of what appears to be the first iron pin-jointed chain. These chains were probably designed to transmit pulling, not wrapping, power because they consist only of plates and pins and have metal fittings. However, da Vinci's sketch does show a roller bearing. actually made its first appearance.\\" The first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain drive was depicted in the written horological treatise of the Song Dynasty by the medieval Chinese polymath mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020-1101 AD), who used it to operate the armillary sphere of his astronomical clock tower as well as the clock jack figurines presenting the time of day by mechanically banging gongs and drums.Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Cave Books, Ltd. Page 111, 165, 456‚Äì457. The chain drive itself converted rotary to reclinear motion and was given power via the hydraulic works of Su's water clock tank and waterwheel, the latter which acted as a large gear.Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd, pp. 445 & 448, 469-471. Chains versus belts Roller chain and sprockets is a very efficient method of power transmission compared to (friction-drive) belts, with far less frictional loss. Although chains can be made stronger than belts, their greater mass increases drive train inertia. Drive chains are most often made of metal, while belts are often rubber, plastic, urethane, or other substances. Drive belts can slip unless they have teeth, which means that the output side may not rotate at a precise speed, and some work gets lost to the friction of the belt as it bends around the pulleys. Wear on rubber or plastic belts and their teeth is often easier to observe, and chains wear out faster than belts if not properly lubricated. One problem with roller chains is the variation in speed, or surging, caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the chain as it goes around the sprocket link by link. It starts as soon as the pitch line of the chain contacts the first tooth of the sprocket. This contact occurs at a point below the pitch circle of the sprocket. As the sprocket rotates, the chain is raised up to the pitch circle and is then dropped down again as sprocket rotation continues. Because of the fixed pitch length, the pitch line of the link cuts across the chord between two pitch points on the sprocket, remaining in this position relative to the sprocket until the link exits the sprocket. This rising and falling of the pitch line is what causes chordal effect or speed variation.This is because there is a pitch length in chains, and they can only bend at the pitch point. In other words, conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution (\\"Chordal action\\"2.2.1 Chordal Action: You will find that the position in which the chain and the sprockets engage fluctuates, and the chain vibrates along with this fluctuation. ). If the chain moves at constant speed, then the shafts must accelerate and decelerate constantly. If one sprocket rotates at a constant speed, then the chain (and probably all other sprockets that it drives) must accelerate and decelerate constantly. This is usually not an issue with many drive systems; however, most motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to virtually eliminate this vibration issue. Toothed belt drives are designed to limit this issue by operating at a constant pitch radiusBut in toothed-belt systems, chordal action occurs by circle and chord, the same as chains. Generally this effect is less than 0.6 percent, but when combined with the deflection of the pulley center and errors of belt pitch or pulley pitch, it can amount to 2 to 3 percent. ). Chains are often narrower than belts, and this can make it easier to shift them to larger or smaller gears in order to vary the gear ratio. Multi-speed bicycles with derailleurs make use of this. Also, the more positive meshing of a chain can make it easier to build gears that can increase or shrink in diameter, again altering the gear ratio. However, some newer synchronous belts claim to have \\"equivalent capacity to roller chain drives in the same width\\". Both can be used to move objects by attaching pockets, buckets, or frames to them; chains are often used to move things vertically by holding them in frames, as in industrial toasters, while belts are good at moving things horizontally in the form of conveyor belts. It is not unusual for the systems to be used in combination; for example the rollers that drive conveyor belts are themselves often driven by drive chains. Drive shafts are another common method used to move mechanical power around that is sometimes evaluated in comparison to chain drive; in particular belt drive vs chain drive vs shaft drive is a key design decision for most motorcycles. Drive shafts tend to be tougher and more reliable than chain drive, but the bevel gears have far more friction than a chain. For this reason virtually all high-performance motorcycles use chain drive, with shaft-driven arrangements generally used for non-sporting machines. Toothed-belt drives are used for some (non-sporting) models. Use in vehicles =Bicycles= Chain drive was the main feature which differentiated the safety bicycle introduced in 1885, with its two equal-sized wheels, from the direct-drive penny-farthing or \\"high wheeler\\" type of bicycle. The popularity of the chain-driven safety bicycle brought about the demise of the penny-farthing, and is still a basic feature of bicycle design today. =Automobiles= Transmitting power to the wheels Chain final drive, 1912 illustration Mack AC delivery truck at the Petersen Automotive Museum with chain drive visible Austin 1906 plan view Austin 1906 elevation French Gladiator car, 1902, with chain drive Chain drive was a popular power transmission system from the earliest days of the automobile. It gained prominence as an alternative to the Syst√®me Panhard with its rigid Hotchkiss driveshaft and universal joints. A chain-drive system uses one or more roller chains to transmit power from a differential to the rear axle. This system allowed for a great deal of vertical axle movement (for example, over bumps), and was simpler to design and build than a rigid driveshaft in a workable suspension. Also, it had less unsprung weight at the rear wheels than the Hotchkiss drive, which would have had half the weight of the driveshaft, and differential to carry as well. This meant that the vehicle would have a smoother ride. The lighter unsprung mass would allow the suspension to react to bumps more effectively. Frazer Nash were strong proponents of this system using one chain per gear selected by dog clutches. The Frazer Nash chain drive system, (designed for the GN Cyclecar Company by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey) was very effective, allowing extremely fast gear selections. The Frazer Nash (or GN) transmission system provided the basis for many \\"special\\" racing cars of the 1920s and 1930s, the most famous being Basil Davenport's Spider which held the outright record at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the 1920s. The last popular chain drive automobile was the Honda S600 of the 1960s. In engines Internal combustion engines often use a timing chain to drive the camshaft(s). This is an area in which chain drives frequently compete directly with timing belt drive systems, particularly when the engine has one or more overhead camshafts, and provides an excellent example of some of the differences and similarities between the two approaches. For this application, chains last longer, but are often harder to replace, as they must be enclosed in a space into which lubricating oil can be introduced. Being heavier, the chain robs more power, but is also less likely to fail. The camshaft of a four stroke engine rotates at half crankshaft speed, so the camshaft sprocket has twice as many teeth as the crankshaft sprocket. Less common alternatives to timing chain drives include spur gears or bevel gears combined with a shaft. =Transfer cases= 'Silent chain' drives inside a 1912 gearbox Today, inverted tooth drive chains are commonly used in passenger car and light truck transfer cases. =Motorcycles= Chain drive versus belt drive or use of a driveshaft is a fundamental design decision in motorcycle design; nearly all motorcycles use one of these three designs.

It was used by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts and the Pacific War. Ever-greater thicknesses of armour on tanks rendered the Type 97 obsolete by about 1942. Development and description Concerned by reports of Chinese purchases of Vickers 6-Ton tanksZaloga, p. 29 and rising tensions with the Soviet Red Army along the Manchurian border,Ness, p. 92 the IJA issued a requirement for an anti-tank rifle in 1935. The Nagoya Arsenal submitted a weapon derived from their copy of the Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun while the Kokura Arsenal submitted a new design using a 20√ó125mm cartridge. The first round of testing in March 1936 was not satisfactory and both guns were returned to their designers to rectify problems encountered during the trials. The Kokura Arsenal built eight prototypes for the second round of trials held at the Army Infantry School in 1937, after which the IJA rejected the Nagoya weapon. It identified several problems that needed to fixed and a batch of fifty guns was built for operational trials in 1938. After another round of trials in December at the infantry and cavalry schools, the weapon was accepted as the Type 97 Automatic Cannon. The gun has a gas-operated delayed-blowback mechanism in which the barrel and receiver also recoiled to help steady the weapon.Williams, p. 220 Despite reports that it can fire in full-automatic mode,Handbook, p. 216 the weapon lacks a selector switch to distinguish between single-shot and fully automatic modes. The Type 97 was the heaviest anti-tank rifle of World War II and weighs ready to fire, minus the gun shield, and including the shield and four carrying handles, handily exceeding its design weight of . It uses a seven-round removable box magazine mounted above the receiver. The gun can fire a dozen rounds per minute. It has an overall length of and the removable barrel, including the muzzle brake, was (53-calibers) long.Zaloga, p. 70 The Type 97 fired solid-steel armour- piercing-tracer (AP-T), high-explosive-tracer and high-explosive incendiary- tracer shells.Zaloga, p. 31 The initial AP-T round was the Type 97 and it had a softer grade of steel than the later Type 100.Ness, p. 93 The AP-T projectiles had a muzzle velocity of .Williams, p. 226 Based on a captured Japanese ammunition table, the Type 97 round was credited with the ability to penetrate of armour at 90¬∞ at a range of . The same table credited it with the ability to penetrate of armour at .Ness, p. 94 Production and service Production of the Type 97 began in 1939 at the Kokura Arsenal with the first of 950 that were made through 1941. Production ceased that year, although a further 100 rifles were built by the Nihon Seikosho Company in the first half of 1943. Including prototypes, a total of 1,108 rifles were manufactured. The anti-tank rifle cost ¬•6,400 at a time when a normal rifle cost ¬•77.Zaloga, pp. 30‚Äì31 Beginning in 1940, the barrels were chrome-plated to extend their lives. The Type 97 was assigned to IJA infantry battalions, normally on the basis of a single anti-tank platoon allocated to each infantry company. Each platoon had two 11-man sections each with a single Type 97. In addition to the section leader, there were four men assigned to carry the gun, four ammunition bearers and two horse-holders for the nine horses nominally assigned to the section. Over long distances, the Type 97 was broken down into three parts to be carried by the horses.Zaloga, p. 66 The weapon first saw combat during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, where it reportedly disabled a number of the lightly-armoured vehicles used by the Soviets at that time. The Type 97 was not extensively deployed in China until the following year, by which time they were mostly used as infantry support weapons. Reflecting this change, most of the ammunition produced in 1941‚Äì1942 was high-explosive, not armour-piercing. The rifle was not widely deployed in the Southwest Pacific during World War II, although it was used by the Teishin Shudan paratroopers of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. The Type 97's 20 mm round was no longer effective against modern tanks after 1942. The Ho-1 and Ho-3 autocannon were developed from the Type 97 for use on aircraft.

It is now Blackbushe Airport. History The station was opened on 1 November 1942 as RAF Hartford Bridge and it was used throughout the remainder of Second World War for reconnaissance, defence and strike operations using Supermarine Spitfires, Douglas Bostons and de Havilland Mosquitoes. It was also the home of the Free French Squadron (Lorraine). During the construction of the airfield, the already built runways were used for glider testing, including the massive General Aircraft Hamilcar. A number of important people used the airfield including King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, Supreme Allied Commander U.S. General Dwight D Eisenhower and British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. Due to its geographical proximity to RAE Farnborough Royal Aircraft Establishment the airfield was used to develop the Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO) system to enable aircraft operations in heavy fog. The station was renamed to RAF Blackbushe on 18 November 1944 and it became an airfield for the Douglas Dakotas of RAF Transport Command during the 1948 airlift during the Berlin Blockade. The RAF Station was closed on 15 November 1946 and in February 1947 the airfield became Blackbushe Airport under the control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. During the 1950s the airfield saw increased used as a base for US Navy transport aircraft. Blackbushe was also considered during WWII in consultations to decide the site of London's post-war principal civil airport. It was only narrowly beaten by Heathrow; the winner was announced in 1944.

The park is divided into two sections. One section of the park, the \\"lower park,\\" is headquartered in the village of Washington Crossing located in Upper Makefield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It marks the location of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolutionary War. The lower park includes 13 historic buildings including McConkey's Ferry Inn, where General George Washington and his aides ate dinner and made plans prior to the crossing. Among the historic buildings is a 20th-century barn that houses 5 replica Durham Boats. Durham boats were large, open boats that were used to transport pig iron along the Delaware River at the time of the Revolution and these boats, along with the ferries and others, were used to transport soldiers, horses, and equipment across the river on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776. The replica boats are used each year when the nighttime crossing is reenacted in the park. Located 4.5 miles away in Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is the park's northern section, the \\"upper park.\\" In its 100-acre area it contains (0.4 km¬≤) Bowman's Hill Tower and the Thompson-Neely House, which was used as a military hospital during Washington's encampment in the area, and the graves of an estimated 40 to 60 soldiers who died there. The exact location of the graves is unknown, though they were partially unearthed during the construction of the nearby Delaware Canal in the early 19th century and during other nearby construction projects. Presently there are 23 memorial headstones as a reminder that the area is a gravesite. The lower park contains a visitor's center, which was renovated from July 2011 to March 2013. The newly renovated visitor's center was opened March 10, 2013. It features a small exhibition with some Revolutionary war artifacts, and an original letter written by George Washington while in the McConkey's Ferry Inn. The park also has obtained a full size digital copy of Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting, Washington Crossing the Delaware, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that is hanging in the auditorium. History and mission of the park The park was created in 1917 and the Washington Crossing Park Commission was established in 1919 to administer and develop the park. Washington Crossing the Delaware, by Emanuel Leutze, 1851 The park was formed to commemorate the famous Crossing as the \\"Turning point of the American Revolution.\\" The Commission's first objective was to develop the site as a historical shrine and its second objective was to preserve its natural beauty and develop its areas for recreational use. Bowman's Hill Tower was built to commemorate what may have been a lookout point for General George Washington's troops to watch the banks of the Delaware River for enemy activity. The park also contains the Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve and the surrounding area is the natural habitat for many native plants, trees, animals and birds. Today the park serves to preserve and interpret the site of the Washington's Crossing of the Delaware. The park is administered by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources(DCNR). Cuts in funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania forced the PHMC to reduce park staffing, which resulted in closing the park to the public in late November, 2009. In 2013, the Pennsylvania state budget and fiscal code mandated that the park transfer from PHMC to DCNR. The switch was finalized in early 2016. The Friends of Washington Crossing Park, a 501(c)(3) private, non-profit corporation, was incorporated in January 2010 to support the PHMC in operating Washington Crossing Historic Park, and the park re- opened to the public in the spring of that same year. The Friends of Washington Crossing Park re-opened the park's gift shop in December 2010. Current full-time, on-site staffing consists of 2 museum professionals and 2 maintenance personnel provided by the PHMC, who work in conjunction with the part-time staff of historical interpreters provided by the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. Washington Crossing Historic Park is open for guided tours Monday through Sundays from 10am ‚Äì 4pm, April 1 ‚Äì December 31. The recreational areas of the park, including the picnic pavilions, are open to the public from dawn to dusk all year. The park holds a reenactment of General Washington's nighttime crossing every year, plus other public programs on related themes throughout the year. The park was included in the Washington's Crossing National Historic Landmark designation in 1961, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. and McConkey's Ferry On the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776, General George Washington and a small army of 2,400 men crossed the Delaware River at McConkey's Ferry, on their way to attack a Hessian garrison of 1,500 in Trenton, New Jersey. The crossing, made during a time when morale was at its lowest point during the American Revolution, renewed hope among the Continental Army, Congress and the general population. On the morning of December 26, at the Battle of Trenton, they were able to force the Hessian soldiers to surrender, without any American casualties. The ferry was first established by Henry Baker in 1684. His grandson, Samuel Baker Jr., sold it to Samuel McConkey (also spelled McKonkey) on December 5, 1774. McConkey sold it to Benjamin Taylor on March 21, 1777. The corresponding ferry on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River was known as Johnson's Ferry.

Dick. It was first published in Star Science Fiction Stories No.3. The story is a satire of two 1950s-era trends: consumerism and increasing Cold War anxiety. Dick wrote in a letter: \\"One day I saw a newspaper headline reporting that the President suggested that if Americans had to buy their bomb shelters, rather than being provided with them by the government, they'd take better care of them, an idea which made me furious. Logically, each of us should own a submarine, a jet fighter, and so forth.\\" It was adapted by Kalen Egan and Travis Sentell for the episode \\"Safe and Sound\\" of the 2017 TV series, Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams. Plot summary The story takes place in 1971 where the vast majority of citizens own private bomb shelters and financially support nuclear war preparations for their town. New models of \\"improved\\" shelters are released and bought every year (much like vacuum cleaners or automobiles) because the Soviets supposedly develop new methods of attack on previously-developed shelters. The story revolves around Mike Foster, the adolescent son of an \\"anti-P,\\" a movement of outsiders refusing to take part in these preparations because they argue the military industrial complex is only creating fear to sell more bomb shelters. Mike, however, lives in fear that he will not have access to a shelter when the war begins and is a social outcast because of his father's political positions. Finally, Foster's father gives up his resistance and buys a brand-new costly bomb shelter model. Foster luckily boards the new shelter. Soon afterward, news reports the Soviets developed a new anti-shelter technique leaving all recent models totally vulnerable, requiring a new \\"adapter\\" to make current models safe again. Then, Mike's Father is forced to sell the shelter back due to economic issues. Foster then runs and hides in the shelter, where he is pulled out by the marketers, and the story ends with a satirical note, a sign saying \\"PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TO MEN, PUBLIC SHELTER, ADMISSION 50¬¢\\".

Compared to access controls commonly enforced by an operating system (OS), encryption passively protects data confidentiality even when the OS is not active, for example, if data is read directly from the hardware or by a different OS. In addition crypto- shredding suppresses the need to erase the data at the end of the disk's lifecycle. Disk encryption generally refers to wholesale encryption that operates on an entire volume mostly transparently to the user, the system, and applications. This is generally distinguished from file-level encryption that operates by user invocation on a single file or group of files, and which requires the user to decide which specific files should be encrypted. Disk encryption usually includes all aspects of the disk, including directories, so that an adversary cannot determine content, name or size of any file. It is well suited to portable devices such as laptop computers and thumb drives which are particularly susceptible to being lost or stolen. If used properly, someone finding a lost device cannot penetrate actual data, or even know what files might be present. Methods The disk's data is protected using symmetric cryptography with the key randomly generated when a disk's encryption is first established. This key is itself encrypted in some way using a password or pass-phrase known (ideally) only to the user. Thereafter, in order to access the disk's data, the user must supply the password to make the key available to the software. This must be done sometime after each operating system start-up before the encrypted data can be used. Done in software, disk encryption typically operates at a level between all applications and most system programs and the low-level device drivers by \\"transparently\\" (from a user's point of view) encrypting data after it is produced by a program but before it is physically written to the disk. Conversely, it decrypts data immediately after being read but before it is presented to a program. Properly done, programs are unaware of these cryptographic operations. Some disk encryption software (e.g., TrueCrypt or BestCrypt) provide features that generally cannot be accomplished with disk hardware encryption: the ability to mount \\"container\\" files as encrypted logical disks with their own file system; and encrypted logical \\"inner\\" volumes which are secretly hidden within the free space of the more obvious \\"outer\\" volumes. Such strategies provide plausible deniability. Well-known examples of disk encryption software include: BitLocker for Windows; FileVault for Apple OS/X; LUKS a standard free software mainly for Linux and TrueCrypt, a non-commercial freeware application, for Windows, OS/X and Linux. * A 2008 study found data remanence in dynamic random access memory (DRAM), with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and much longer times when memory chips were cooled to low temperature. The study authors were able to demonstrate a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular disk encryption systems despite some memory degradation, by taking advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a \\"sleep\\" state, when not under physical control by the computer's legitimate owner. This method of key recovery, however, is suited for controlled laboratory settings and is extremely impractical for \\"field\\" use due to the equipment and cooling systems required. Other Features =Plausible deniability= Some disk encryption systems, such as VeraCrypt, CipherShed (active open source forks of the discontinued TrueCrypt project), BestCrypt (proprietary trialware), offers levels of plausible deniability, which might be useful if a user is compelled to reveal the password of an encrypted volume. =Hidden volumes= Hidden volumes are a steganographic feature that allows a second, \\"hidden\\", volume to reside within the apparent free space of a visible \\"container\\" volume (sometimes known as \\"outer\\" volume). The hidden volume has its own separate file system, password, and encryption key distinct from the container volume. The content of the hidden volume is encrypted and resides in the free space of the file system of the outer volume‚Äîspace which would otherwise be filled with random values if the hidden volume did not exist. When the outer container is brought online thorough the disk encryption software, whether the inner or outer volume is mounted depends on the password provided. If the \\"normal\\" password/key of the outer volume proves valid, the outer volume is mounted; if the password/key of the hidden volume proves valid, then (and only then) can the existence of hidden volume even be detected, and it is mounted; otherwise if the password/key does not successfully decrypt either the inner or outer volume descriptors, then neither is mounted. Once a hidden volume has been created inside the visible container volume, the user will store important-looking information (but which the user does not actually mind revealing) on the outer volume, whereas more sensitive information is stored within the hidden volume. If the user is forced to reveal a password, the user can reveal the password to the outer volume, without disclosing the existence of the hidden volume. The hidden volume will not be compromised, if the user takes certain precautions in overwriting the free areas of the \\"host\\" disk.Plausible Deniability - FreeOTFE instructions for initializing an encrypted disk such that the presence of a hidden disk cannot be detected =No identifying features= Volumes, be they stored in a file or a device/partition, may intentionally not contain any discernible \\"signatures\\" or unencrypted headers. As cipher algorithms are designed to be indistinguishable from a pseudorandom permutation without knowing the key, the presence of data on the encrypted volume is also undetectable unless there are known weaknesses in the cipher.This is a design criterion of modern ciphers; in other words, ciphers are considered broken if their output is discernible from random. This means that it is impossible to prove that any file or partition is an encrypted volume (rather than random data) without having the password to mount it. This characteristic also makes it impossible to determine if a volume contains another hidden volume. A file hosted volume (as opposed to partitions) may look out of place in some cases since it will be entirely random data placed in a file intentionally. However, a partition or device hosted volume will look no different from a partition or device that has been wiped with a common disk wiping tool such as Darik's Boot and Nuke. One can plausibly claim that such a device or partition has been wiped to clear personal data. Portable or \\"traveller mode\\" means the encryption software can be run without installation to the system hard drive. In this mode, the software typically installs a temporary driver from the portable media. Since it is installing a driver (albeit temporarily), administrative privileges are still required. =Resizable volumes= Some disk encryption software allows encrypted volumes to be resized. Not many systems implement this fully, and resort to using \\"sparse files\\" to achieve this. =Backups= Encrypted volumes contain \\"header\\" (or \\"CDB\\") data, which may be backed up. Overwriting these data will destroy the volume, so the ability to back them up is useful. Restoring the backup copy of these data may reset the volume's password to what it was when the backup was taken.

In 1526 this group proclaimed Anna as Duchess, the last representative of the family (however, her elder sister Sophia was still alive at the time). This resistance to the duchy's incorporation, which was largely caused by their fear of losing their significance, was also fuelled by political forces interested in maintaining the status of fiefdoms. In this state Masovia would be united in resistance against the Crown and would also have encouraged the House of Habsburg (in comparison with the Polish rivalry for influence in Moldova). In 1536 Anna concluded a marriage with Stanis≈Çaw OdrowƒÖ≈º. But the king refused to return their goods in return for 10 000 ducats. This caused conflict between the couple and Sigismund I the Old, who deprived the groom of his offices in Odrowaza. The dispute ended with the parliament in 1537, which forced Anna and her husband to take an oath before the king, and renounce the hereditary rights of Masovia and the estate for the benefit of the Crown.

Instead of a standard mortar bomb, the projectile was a tube containing seven individual mines, each approximately 11/16ths of an inch in diameter (18 mm) and long. Each mine was equipped with its own parachute. When fired, the mortar threw the shell to a range of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (900 to 1,200 m) and a maximum altitude of approximately 600 m. The shell ejected the mines at the top of its arc. They would then float down on their parachutes. They were fused to detonate on contact or after a fixed time period, damaging nearby aircraft. The projectile could alternatively be launched using a standard Type 11 70 mm infantry mortar. The weapon could also be used like a simple cluster bomb, by firing over enemy troops.

Afghan Jewish communities now exist mostly in Israel, and the United States. Jewish cemetery in Herat, Afghanistan. The Jews had formed a community of leather and karakul merchants, landowners and money lenders alike. The large Jewish families mostly lived in the border city of Herat, while the families' patriarchs traveled back and forth on trading trips across the mountains of Afghanistan on whose rocks their prayers were carved in Hebrew and sometimes even Aramaic, moving between the routes on the ancient silk road. Jews also settled in the capital city of Kabul. As of 2019, only one known Jew, Zablon Simintov, remains residing in Afghanistan; he cares for a synagogue in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. History Afghan Jews Records of a Jewish population in Afghanistan go back to the 7th century. Afghan Jews claim ancestry to the Lost Israelite Tribes. Balkh was a main center for Jewish life in ancient Afghanistan. The city was said to have been the burial place of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel, and the home of the prophet Jeremiah. The city of Herat was important in the silk route, and other trading routes. In modern times, ruins still exist, and harbor a Jewish cemetery. Muhammad al- Idrisi (died 1166) wrote that Kabul had a Jewish quarter.Ben Zion Yehoshua- Raz, ‚ÄúKabul‚Äù, in: Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. First published online: 2010 In the 18th century, Jews serving in the army of Nadir Shah settled in Kabul as his treasury guards. In 2011, so-called Afghan Geniza, an 11th-century collection of manuscript fragments in Hebrew, Aramaic, Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Persian was found in Taliban caves in Afghanistan. Some 29 pages from the collection were bought by the National Library of Israel in 2013. = Soviet Refugee Crisis = By the early 1930s, some 60,000 refugees had fled from Soviet territory to Afghanistan. In 1932, Muhammed Nadir Shah created a border treaty with the Soviet Union preventing asylum seekers from fleeing the border and into Afghanistan. Later that same year, Afghanistan began deporting refugees back to Soviet Union or specified Chinese territories. Soviet Jews already in Afghanistan, who were attempting to flee further south, were detained in the capital city of Kabul, while any Soviet Jews apprehend at the border were immediately deported. Soviet Jews were accused of espionage and the intent to disseminate radical Bolshevist propaganda. However, by 1933, non-refugee Afghani Jews, those who had lived there for decades if not centuries, were also targeted. All Jews who were citizens of Afghanistan were ordered to relocate to their birthplace, which was most often Herat or Kabul. This was an attempt by the government to further enforce the policy that Jews were not natives of the Northern provinces of Afghanistan. After Muhammad Nadir Shah was assassinated in 1933, his son continued the harsh fate for the Jews. By the end of 1933, nearly all of the Jews in northern cities had been expelled, and returned to Central Afghanistan. In 1935, a delegate to the Zionist Congress declared that an estimated 40,000 Bukharan Jews had been killed or starved. In the summer of 1935, riots erupted in Herat, the Afghan city with the largest Jewish population, due to a dispute between two boys, one Jewish and one Muslim. The two boys got into a fight over unknown reasons, causing the Muslim boy to fall down the stairs. The Jewish boy, Aba Ben Simon, was blamed, and others began spreading rumors that he was trying to forcibly convert the other to Judaism. This incident caused Herat's Shiite Muslims to take up arms against the Jews and pillage their shops, homes and beatings at the hands of the mobs. Jewish women, regardless of their marital status, were subjected to being kidnapped and raped, and sometimes were forcibly converted and married off to their attackers. Some Jews fled Herat, and were never allowed to return. Some Jews tried to flee to British-controlled India. The British colonial government categorized them by passports: Iranian, Russian and Afghani. Those with Russian passports were once again accused of ‚ÄúBolshevist ties‚Äù and denied entry. The British Raj tried to deport many Afghani and Russian Jews back to the Soviet Union under the guise of allegedly violating the ‚Äúbehavioral conduct‚Äù codes of British India (i.e., Peshawar Conspiracy Cases), when in fact the colonial government feared they would disseminate socialism among the populace of native Indian colonial subjects and lead them to revolt against oppressive colonial rule, adding to the then- growing Indian independence movement. The Jewish Life in Kabul and Herat continued to worsen. Many Jews fled illegally into India during the 1940s. Thousands of Jews fled to Palestine, (and eventually Israel after it was established in 1948). Some Jews also made it all the way to the United States, settling mainly in New York City's borough of Queens. = Emigration = By 1948, over 5,000 Jews existed in Afghanistan, and after they were allowed to emigrate in 1951, most of them moved to Israel and the United States. Afghanistan was the only Muslim country that allowed Jewish families to emigrate without revoking their citizenship first. Afghan Jews left the country en masse in the 1960s. Their resettlement in New York and Tel Aviv was motivated by a search for a better life. By 1969, some 300 remained, and most of these left after the Soviet invasion of 1979, leaving 10 Afghan Jews in 1996, most of them in Kabul. More than 10,000 Jews of Afghan descent presently live in Israel. Over 200 families of Afghan Jews live in New York City in the USA. Over 100 Jews of Afghan descent live in London. Current population By the end of 2004, only two Jews were left in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov and Isaac Levy. Simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001. They lived at separate ends of the dilapidated Kabul synagogue. They kept denouncing each other to the authorities, and both spent time in Taliban jails. The Taliban also confiscated the Torah. The contentious relationship between Simentov and Levy was dramatized in a play inspired by news reports of the two which appeared in international news media following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban regime. The play, entitled \\"The Last Two Jews of Kabul,\\" was written by playwright Josh Greenfeld and was staged in New York City in 2002. In January 2005, Levy died of natural causes. Simentov is now the last remaining Jew in Afghanistan. Simentov is trying to recover the confiscated Torah. Simentov, who does not speak Hebrew, claims that the man who stole his Torah is now in U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. Simentov has a wife and two daughters who live in Israel, and he said he was considering joining them. However, when asked during a recent interview whether he would go to Israel, Simentov retorted, \\"Go to Israel? What business do I have there? Why should I leave?\\" There is also a disused Synagogue in Herat, in western Afghanistan, which contains most of its original characteristics although in a state of disrepair.See Yu Aw Synagogue for references.

Although it was difficult and expensive weapon for Japan to produce with its limited industrial infrastructure and production technology, it was produced in larger numbers than any other medium anti- aircraft weapon in the Japanese inventory. Over 2000 units completed by the time of the surrender of Japan.MacLean. Japanese Artillery; Weapons and Tactics In the early phases of World War II, Allied military intelligence initially assumed that the Japanese Type 88 was a copy of the formidable German Flak 36/37 88 mm gun due to its name. However, there is no connection between the two weapons. The confusion arose from the Japanese Army's nomenclature system. ‚ÄúType 88‚Äù corresponds to the year 2588 in the Japanese imperial year, and not to the caliber of the weapon. Design The Type 88 75 mm AA gun had a single piece gun barrel with sliding breech, mounted on a central pedestal. The firing platform was supported by five legs, each of which (along with the central pedestal) had adjustable screwed foot for leveling. For transport each of the legs could be folded, and the barrel was also partially retractable. Combat record A Type 88 used as coastal artillery on Attu Island in 1943 Tactically employed in battle as a four-gun field battery, Japanese combat forces used the weapon during the invasion of Manchuria, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and the Second Sino-Japanese War. They found the Type 88 gun's high velocity rounds were extremely effective anti- tank weapon when fired horizontally. The weapon was the standard Japanese mobile antiaircraft artillery weapon and used against Allied forces more than any other artillery weapon. During both the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa it was used effectively with armor-piercing rounds against American M4 Sherman tanks and as a coastal-defense gun. Against armor, it had the advantage of a 360 degree traverse, but it was not easily moved and so it was less effective when fired from ambush against tanks. Towards the end of the war many of the Type 88s were withdrawn from front line combat service and sent back to the home islands, to help reinforce Japan's homeland defenses against Allied air raids and to prepare for the threat of Allied invasion.Chant, Artillery of World War II, p. 63 It was assigned to civil defense units in major Japanese cities, but its maximum effective vertical range of meant it was ineffective against the USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers, which could fly as high as . Some guns were also assigned to coastal defense batteries. A variant was experimentally fitted to a Ki-109 bomber in an attempt to shoot down the B-29 Superfortress bombers at high altitude. =Weapons of comparable role, performance and era= British QF 3 inch 20 cwt * United States 3-inch M1918 gun Ammunition Anti-aircraft  Type 90 HE AA pointed: complete round: 8.94 kg, projectile: 6.52 kg with Type 89 AA fuse * High explosive  Type 90 HE pointed: complete round: 8.55 kg, projectile: 6.35 with Type 88 impact or Type 88 delay * Armor-piercing  Type 95 APHE: complete round: 6.2 kg * Shrapnel * Smoke * Incendiary * Illumination See alsoType 96 AA gun prime mover Notes References Bishop, Chris (eds) The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II.

His research interests were in quantum field theory, especially the interface between high-energy particle physics and cosmology. He is best known as one of the first to describe the Higgs mechanism, and for his research on topological defects. From the 1950s he was concerned about the nuclear arms race and from 1970 took leading roles in promoting the social responsibility of the scientist. Early life and education Kibble was born in Madras, in the Madras Presidency of British India, on 23 December 1932. He was the son of the statistician Walter F. Kibble, and the grandson of William Bannerman, an officer in the Indian Medical Service, and the author Helen Bannerman. His father was a math professor at Madras Christian College, and Dr. Kibble grew up playing on the grounds of the college and solving math puzzles his father gave him. He was educated at Doveton Corrie School in Madras and then in Edinburgh, Scotland, at Melville College and at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc in 1955, MA in 1956 and a PhD in 1958. Career Kibble worked on mechanisms of symmetry breaking, phase transitions and the topological defects (monopoles, cosmic strings or domain walls) that can be formed. He is most noted for his co- discovery of the Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson with Gerald Guralnik and C. R. Hagen. As part of Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration, the journal recognised this discovery as one of the milestone papers in PRL history. For this discovery Kibble was awarded the American Physical Society's 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics. While Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble are widely considered to have authored the most complete of the early papers on the Higgs theory, they were controversially not included in the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.‚ÄúThe 2013 Nobel prizes. Higgs‚Äôs bosuns.‚Äù Economist (October 12, 2013)‚ÄúWhy are some scientists unhappy with the Nobel prizes?‚Äù Economist (October 9, 2013) In 2014, Nobel Laureate Peter Higgs expressed disappointment that Kibble had not been chosen to share the Nobel Prize with Fran√ßois Englert and himself. Kibble pioneered the study of topological defect generation in the early universe. The paradigmatic mechanism of defect formation across a second-order phase transition is known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. His paper on cosmic strings introduced the phenomenon into modern cosmology. He was one of the two co-chairs of an interdisciplinary research programme funded by the European Science Foundation (ESF) on Cosmology in the Laboratory (COSLAB) which ran from 2001 to 2005. He was previously the coordinator of an ESF Network on Topological Defects in Particle Physics, Condensed Matter & Cosmology (TOPDEF). =Awards and honours= Kibble was an elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1980, One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: of the Institute of Physics (1991), and of Imperial College London (2009). He was also a member of the American Physical Society (1958), the European Physical Society (1975) and the Academia Europaea (2000). In 2008, Kibble was named an Outstanding Referee by the American Physical Society. In addition to the Sakurai Prize, Kibble has been awarded the Hughes Medal (1981) of the Royal Society, the Rutherford (1984) and Guthrie Medals (1993) of the Institute of Physics, the Dirac Medal (2013), the Albert Einstein Medal (2014) and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2014). He was appointed a CBE in the 1998 Birthday Honours and was knighted in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to physics.

He succeeded Augusto B. Legu√≠a, from 1912 to 1914. Billinghurst was of part English descent. The surname Billinghurst is a locational name 'of Billinghurst' a parish in Sussex, England. During his presidency, Billinghurst became embroiled in an increasingly bitter series of conflicts with Congress, ranging from proposed advanced social legislation to settlement of the Tacna- Arica dispute. This provoked a military uprising organized by civilian opponents to his regime who used the military to carry out a coup. As a result of the uprising, Billinghurst was sent into exile in Chile where he died shortly thereafter. Member of the Civilista Party Billinghurst belonged to the Civilistas group, which were then considered the architects of unprecedented political stability and economic growth in the country, but they also set in motion profound social changes that would, in time, alter the political panorama of Peru. As First Vice President of Peru under the Pi√©rola Administration (1895‚Äì1899), Billinghurst was involved in several attempts to solve the Tacna and Arica territorial dispute with Chile. On April 9, 1898, a memorandum was subscribed between the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Raimundo Silva Cruz and Billinghurst. It established that before a plebiscite could be held between both countries, an arbitrage would first be requested to the Queen of Spain, Mar√≠a Cristina de Habsburgo-Lorena (1858‚Äì1929) to determine the conditions of the vote. Subsequent events led the Protocol of Billinghurst-Latorre not to be ratified by the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. A direct result of this setback was the break of diplomatic relations between Peru and Chile in 1901. Billinghurst served as the President of the Senate from 1896 to 1897.http://www.congreso.gob.pe/participacion/museo/congreso/presidentes/Guillermo_billinghurst 1912 elections The elections of 1912 were the most passionate ones of the so-called Aristocratic Republic (a term coined by Peruvians referring to those in power that were mostly from the social elite of the country). The Civilist Party rallied behind the candidacy of Antero Asp√≠llaga, one of the most prominent and conservative members of the Party. His opponents accused him of being a Chilean-born Peruvian unfit for office. The Civilistas, however, were unable to manage the new social forces that their policies unleashed. This first became apparent in 1912 when the millionaire businessman Guillermo Billinghurst-‚Äìthe reform-minded, populist former mayor of Lima-‚Äìwas able to organize a general strike to block the election of the official Civilista presidential candidate and force his own election by Congress.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/06/29/104649035.pdf Presidency One of the main accomplishments of the Billinghurst administration was the establishment of important legislation that guaranteed the Eight-hour day in Peru. When Congress opened impeachment hearings against Billinghurst in 1914, he threatened to arm the workers and forcibly dissolve Congress. Guillermo Billinghurst was overthrown on February 4, 1914, in a military coup headed by colonel Oscar R. Benavides, Javier and Manuel Prado, and conservatives members of the Civilista Party. Later in exile, Billingshurst claimed the following: \\"The young Prado, in an extense and pathetic speech, gave me the details and motives behind the coup: All of them (the mutineerered) recognised my patriotism, integrity and my capability to handle the government. However, the only and most serious mistake that I made was the course that my internal politics was doing to the country and, finally, I think the sons of former president Prado must ¬´clean his fathers memory¬ª\\" See also List of Presidents of Peru * Politics of Peru  References  External links 1851 births 1915 deaths People from Arica Province Peruvian people of German descent Peruvian people of English descent Mayors of Lima Presidents of Peru Vice Presidents of Peru Presidents of the Senate of Peru Democratic Party (Peru) politicians Leaders ousted by a coup ","title":"Guillermo Billinghurst"},{"id":"1845181","text":"The was an anti-aircraft gun developed by the Imperial Japanese Army.

This was developed into a mobile anti-aircraft gun with a carriage which had wheels, and was exported to the Republic of China, Persia, and Thailand. Japanese forces captured examples of the Bofors M29 75mm AA gun from the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang government of China, and the Army Technical Bureau was impressed with its performance, which was much superior to the existing Japanese Type 88 75 mm AA Gun. By reverse engineering a close copy was designed and went into production in 1943.Bishop, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II. However, Japan lacked the raw materials and its industrial infrastructure was too damaged by air raids to follow through with mass production.

The aim of the texts was to give in 'a condensed form', a faithful and impartial description of each place. The firm of Samuel Lewis and Co. was based in London. Samuel Lewis the elder died in 1865. His son of the same name predeceased him in 1862.  A Topographical Dictionary of England  This work contains every fact of importance tending to illustrate the local history of England. Arranged alphabetically by place (village, parish, town, etc.), it provides a faithful description of all English localities as they existed at the time of first publication (1831), showing exactly where a particular civil parish was located in relation to the nearest town or towns, the barony, county, and province in which it was situated, its principal landowners, the diocese in which it was situated, and‚Äîof novel importance‚Äîthe Roman Catholic district in which the parish was located and the names of corresponding Catholic parishes. There were six subsequent editions, the last of which (1848-9) was in four volumes and an atlas.  A Topographical Dictionary of Wales  First published in 1833, there was a second edition in 1837, a third in 1843, and a fourth (in two volumes and an atlas) in 1849. Title page of \\"A Topographical Dictionary of Wales\\", volume II, 3rd edition The title page of the first edition gives an indication of the ambitious scope of the work: The work is in two large volumes with a folding map of Wales and separate county maps facing the entry for each individual county. The 4th edition was transcribed and made available free-to-view online by the University of London.  A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland  First published in 1837 in two volumes, with an accompanying atlas, it marked a new and significantly higher standard in such accounts of Ireland. Apart from The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland published in 1845, it has not been superseded. The first edition is available online. A second edition was published in 1842. In the 1837 preface, the editor noted that: Lewis relied on the information provided by local contributors and on the earlier works published such as Coote's Statistical Survey (1801), Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Road of Ireland (1777), Pigot's Trade Directory (1824) and other sources. He also used the various parliamentary reports and in particular the census of 1831 and the education returns of the 1820s and early 1830s. Local contributors were given the proof sheets for final comment and revision. The names of places are those in use prior to the publication of the Ordnance Survey Atlas in 1838.

It is named for Piedmont Avenue, a commercial street known for dining and retail. The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Temescal and Broadway on the west, Oakland Avenue and the City of Piedmont (a separate municipality, an enclave within Oakland) on the east, the Mountain View Cemetery on the north, and the MacArthur Freeway section of Interstate 580 on the south. History The Piedmont Avenue neighborhood was founded in the late 1800s. It developed after Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1863, bringing visitors and public transportation. The area was annexed into Oakland in 1897. Landmarks and features The gates of the Mountain View Cemetery at the end of Piedmont Avenue At the north end of Piedmont Avenue and Pleasant Valley Avenue is the hillside Mountain View Cemetery, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and opened in 1863. It is known for Millionaire's Row, a section high on the hill lined with the ornate mausoleums of wealthy families, including those of Domingo Ghirardelli, Henry J. Kaiser, and Charles Crocker. Other notable people buried in the cemetery include civil rights activists Fred Korematsu and Bobby Hutton, poet Ina Coolbrith, and architect Julia Morgan, who also designed the nearby Chapel of the Chimes. The cemetery was featured prominently in the 2018 movie Blindspotting. Near the center of the Piedmont Avenue commercial strip, at 4021 Piedmont Ave. is another Julia Morgan-designed building, originally built as the Fred C. Turner Stores. This 1916 red brick building hosts both restaurants and retail, and features glazed terra cotta in the style of the della Robbia family. Next door, at 4037 Piedmont Ave., is the location of the original Longs Drugs store, which opened in 1938. The building currently hosts a Posh Bagel. Piedmont Avenue also has \\"the Bay Area's Book Row,\\" with multiple independent bookstores concentrated within a six-block radius; the Piedmont Theatre, which is the oldest still-operating theater in Oakland (built in 1917);https://www.landmarktheatres.com/san-francisco-east- bay/piedmont-theatre/info/ and the 1893 ice cream parlor Fentons Creamery, which was featured in Pixar's 2009 movie Up.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/05/27/DDK517QG6J.DTL 4063 Piedmont Ave., which was formerly a Key System station At Piedmont Avenue and 41st Street are the Key Route Plaza and what is left of the Key System's C-line station, which was built in 1939. The former station is an angular building with a clock tower, which was restored by a group led by neighborhood activist Michael Lydon. In 2005, with support from the Piedmont Avenue Neighborhood Improvement League, Rocky Riche-Baird painted a mural recognizing the building's history, including the Key System's founder, Francis Marion Smith. However, a large part of the mural was controversially destroyed during renovations in 2014. Another Riche-Baird mural about the area's native Ohlone people, \\"The Capture of the Solid.

The company holds two royal warrants. History Holland & Holland was founded by Harris Holland (1806‚Äì1896) in 1835. Portrait of Harris Holland Harris Holland was born in 1806 in London. Although accounts of his background are somewhat sketchy, it is believed that his father was an organ builder, while Harris had a tobacco wholesale business in London. He was successful, and was often seen at various pigeon shoots at important London clubs, as well as leasing a grouse moor in Yorkshire. Having no children of his own, he took on his nephew Henry Holland as an apprentice in 1861. In 1867 Henry became a partner and in 1876 the name changed to Holland & Holland. Although Henry was a full partner, Harris kept strict control and was the only one who could sign a cheque until he died in 1896. At first, the guns bore the inscription H.Holland, without an address, and it is probable that these were built in the trade to his design. It is not known when Harris Holland started his own manufacturing, but it is estimated to be in the 1850s. This start makes him very unusual among the London Best makers, as others such as Purdey, Boss, Lang and Lancaster had apprenticed with Joseph Manton, while others such as Beesley, Grant and Atkin apprenticed with Purdey or Boss. In 1883, Holland & Holland entered the trials organized by the magazine The Field and won all of the rifle categories. This set a new standard of excellence for the competition among English gunmakers. In 1885, patents were granted to Holland & Holland for their Paradox gun, a shotgun with rifling in the front two inches of the barrel. In 1908, they patented the detachable lock feature with small lever, for sidelock shotguns. The last major development in the evolution of the sidelock side-by-side gun occurred in 1922, when the H&H; assisted-opening mechanism was patented. This gun, the self-opening Royal side-by-side, has been hugely influential in gun- making throughout the world. In the period after World War II under the leadership of new owner and Managing Director Malcolm Lyell, the company made sorties to India, where guns from the famous collections of the princes and maharajahs were bought back, developing an important market for second-hand pieces. In 1989, all remaining shares in H&H; were bought by the French luxury group Chanel. Since then, the factory building, in use since 1898, has been extensively renovated and equipped with modern technology. Guns such as the Royal Over & Under or side-by-side double-barreled shotguns were improved and reintroduced, and they are available from 4 bore to .360 inch. A hand-built gun from H&H; can cost around for a shotgun and close to for some rifles, with prices roughly doubling with luxury engraving, and there is a waiting period of 2‚Äì3 years between ordering and delivery. During the Second World War, Holland & Holland, along with other companies, fitted the telescopic sights to the Lee-Enfield No.4T sniper rifle. In the 1990s, Holland & Holland started on a major expansion programme. The company has gunrooms in Dallas and Moscow.

It was one of the few weapons in the Japanese inventory capable of reaching the USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers that were attacking cities and other targets in the Japanese home islands.Bishop, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II. However, by late 1943 it became apparent that the B-29 was capable of flying at altitudes in excess of 10,000 meters, beyond the effective ceiling of the Type 3 12 cm gun. An emergency project was initiated in December 1943, to address this issue. To save time, the existing Type 3 design was scaled up to 15 centimeters in caliber, with a corresponding increase in range and firepower. The project was completed relatively quickly, with test guns ready for firing 17 months after the project starting. However, by this point it was already too late ‚Äî all major Japanese cities had been destroyed by the strategic bombing campaign against Japan, and American bombers were moving onto secondary targets. Japan lacked the raw materials and industrial infrastructure to follow through with mass production. Only two units of the powerful new Type 5 were completed before the surrender of Japan.

Combat record Coming into service at the end of the war, the two Type 5s completed were retained on the home islands as part of the bolstering of Japan's defenses against Allied air raids and against the perceived threat of Allied invasion. These two guns were deployed to Kugayama, Suginami ward in the outskirts of Tokyo. In a single engagement on 1 August 1945, they brought down two B-29 Superfortress bombers.

As the leader of NWO Japan, Team 2000 and Black New Japan, he was the promotion's top heel for much of his career, beginning in 1994 when he adopted his Yakuza inspired gimmick. Aside from his work in NJPW, Chono has also made appearances for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), as a member of the New World Order, as well as occasional appearances in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Osaka Pro Wrestling. Chono holds the record for most wins of the G1 Climax at 5, which has earned him the nicknames \\"Mr. August\\" and \\"Mr. G1\\". He is a former seven- time IWGP Tag Team Champion, and a former one-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion and a former one-time NWA Heavyweight Champion.  Professional wrestling career  = New Japan Pro-Wrestling =  Early years (1984‚Äì1989)  Ch≈çno debuted in 1984 against Keiji Mutoh at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) event in Saitama, Japan.John Molinaro, The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 198. In 1987, he defeated Shinya Hashimoto to win the Young Lions Cup. After winning the tournament, he went on an excursion that started in Europe, wrestling for Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association. After a while in Europe, Chono went on an excursion to North America, starting in the United States, where he wrestled in NWA territories in the Kansas City and Alabama areas. He would also later wrestle in the Canadian Maritimes and in Puerto Rico, where he, Hashimoto, and Mutoh formed The Three Musketeers. Chono returned to NJPW part-time in July 1988. He came back to the United States later in October 1988 and teamed with Mike Davis in Continental Championship Wrestling (CCW), by then renamed the Continental Wrestling Federation (CWF), and won that company's tag titles as the Japanese Connection. In April 1989, he took part in the IWGP Heavyweight Championship tournament, held at New Japan's very first show at the Tokyo Dome; he lost to eventual winner of the tournament and new champion Big Van Vader in the quarterfinals. During this time, he would return to the United States and have a brief run in Australia.  Rise to superstardom (1989‚Äì1994)  Upon Chono's return to New Japan in October 1989, on February 10, 1990, he wrestled in the main-event of NJPW's second Tokyo Dome show, teaming with Shinya Hashimoto against Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi, on April 27 he won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Mutoh, and on December 26 he defeated his mentor, wrestling legend Lou Thesz, when Thesz came out of retirement for one last match. The next year, Chono solidified his main-event status with an amazing performance in the first G1 Climax tournament, winning the tournament in a thirty-minute final over Mutoh. He won the tournament again in 1992, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the process. Since then, he has won the tournament on three more occasions. On September 23, 1992, Chono suffered a serious neck injury from a botched sitdown tombstone piledriver while defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Steve Austin. On January 4, 1993, he lost the NWA World title to IWGP Heavyweight champion The Great Muta in a Title vs. Title match. Around 1993, he participated in his third G1 Climax tournament, losing to Hiroshi Hase in the semi-finals. In January 1994, he received a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Shinya Hashimoto, though he would ultimately lose the match. In August 1994, he won his third G1 Climax tournament, defeating Power Warrior in the finals.  nWo Japan and Team 2000 (1994‚Äì2004)  A short time after winning his third G1 Climax, Chono underwent a change in attitude. Originally a clean-cut fan favorite during his NWA World title reign, he turned heel, angered that Power Warrior received a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship before him, as he won the tournament. He also changed his image and adopted a yakuza gimmick, complete with sunglasses, menacing mannerisms and black coats and tights. Chono's partnering with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito as \\"Team Wolf\\" provided a foundation to NJPW's nWo Japan. Establishing himself as leader of its Japanese sister stable, Chono joined the American nWo in December 1996 as it was gaining momentum in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He would also join its successor, Team 2000, which would eventually restructure again. In a match against WCW's Bill Goldberg, Chono supposedly \\"shot\\" the match (actually employing legitimate combat) and dislocated his shoulder. Upon returning to Japan, Chono rejoined NJPW, where he achieved much success. He won the IWGP Tag Team Titles on six occasions and also won the very prestigious IWGP Heavyweight Title in 1998. In 2002, Chono won his fourth G1 Climax tournament and had a brief, memorable feud with WWE's Chyna. He also became a booker for NJPW around this time. In 2003, Chono briefly joined Pro Wrestling NOAH for a handful of matches and was defeated by GHC Champion Kenta Kobashi on 2 May of that year. On October 13, he lost to Hulk Hogan.  Black New Japan and ChoTen (2004‚Äì2007)  In early 2004, Chono became the leader of the Black New Japan stable, which was the most dominating heel stable in NJPW until it was disbanded by Riki Choshu. As a reaction to this, Chono lead an \\"Anti- Choshu Army\\" with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Black Strong Machine. Chono won the 2005 G1 Climax tournament, thus having achieved a record-setting five G1 victories. His success in the G1 has given him the nickname Mr. August. On October 30, 2005, Masahiro Chono and Tenzan defeated the team of Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi to win their fifth IWGP Tag Team Championship. The team went on to rename themselves Cho-Ten, a portmanteau of the members' names. They were stripped of the titles in late 2006 after they split up, and refused to defend them together. Masahiro Chono formed a stable with Shinsuke Nakamura in 2006 called Chono and Nakamura-gun, which began feuding with Tenzan's new group, GBH.  Legend (2007‚Äì2010)  Chono in November 2010 Chono continued to wrestle full-time in 2007, but also began working as a promoter, with New Japan permitting him to set up cards in different areas of Japan. Following the 2007 G1 Climax, it appears that Chono may be breaking away from his BLACK faction and formed the Legend stable, having sworn in wrestlers such as Riki Choshu, Jyushin Thunder Liger, Shiro Koshinaka, and AKIRA. Outside wrestling, Chono began appearing on Gaki no Tsukai's \\"No Laughing Batsu Game\\" as one of the attackers, usually giving H≈çsei Tsukitei a slap to the face. In January 2010 it was reported that Chono would be leaving New Japan and becoming a freelancer, after spending most of his career with the company. = Freelancer (2010‚Äì2013) = In March 2010, Chono portrayed Nobunaga Oda in two matches during a Samurai Festival after leaving New Japan. Chono wrestled AKIRA, who portrayed Mitsuhide Akechi, on both days, winning the first match and losing the second. On August 15, 2010, Chono returned to New Japan to serve as the special ring announcer for the G1 Climax final match between Hiroshi Tanahashi and Satoshi Kojima. On November 5 and 6, Chono appeared in a series of shows in Taiwan for All Japan. On November 5, Chono and Mutoh defeated the Voodoo Murders (TARU and Rene Dupree). The following day, Chono teamed with Mutoh and Masakatsu Funaki to defeat the Voodoo Murders (Dupree, KENSO, and Joe Doering). In December 2010, Chono began working for Antonio Inoki's Inoki Genome Federation as a booker. On March 6, 2011, Chono entered Pro Wrestling ZERO1 for their 10th Anniversary Show, where he defeated Daichi Hashimoto in his debut match. On April 17, 2011, Chono wrestled for Osaka Pro, where he teamed with Kuuga and Orochi in a losing effort against Shodai Tiger Mask, Billyken Kid, and Tsubasa. On August 14, 2011, Chono returned to Osaka Pro, teaming with TAJIRI and Zeus in a victory over JOKER (Kuuga, Orochi, and Tadasuke). On October 3, 2011, Chono returned to NJPW for a Team Wolf reunion match, teaming with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito to defeat Osamu Nishimura, Koji Kanemoto, and Shinjiro Otani. = All Japan Pro Wrestling (2013‚Äì2014) = In January 2013, Chono signed with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as an advisor. On August 25, 2013, Chono teamed with Joe Doering and defeated KENSO and AJPW President Nobuo Shiraishi in an exhibition tag team match. Chono left AJPW in 2014. = Return to freelancing (2014) = Since leaving AJPW, Chono has become a freelancer. His last match on record was on April 13, 2014, for Dotonbori Pro Wrestling, teaming with Daisuke Masaoka and Hayata in a loss to Super Delfin, HUB, and Gran Hamada.  Personal life  On December 28, 1991, Chono married Martina Carlsbad, whom he met while on an excursion in Germany in 1987. Together they have one son (born July 4, 2006) and one daughter (born August 2009). In late-June 1995, Chono's father died. His death forced Chono to miss an IWGP Tag Team title defense and take a hiatus, which forced him and Hiroyoshi Tenzan to vacate the title on July 7, 1995.  Other media  Chono appears as a gang member in the 2017 video game Yakuza Kiwami 2, alongside Genichiro Tenryu, Keiji Mutoh, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami. Besides appearing in numerous TV shows, he was the voice actor in the Japanese dubbed version of Blade 3 for Grimwood.

The United States Internal Revenue Service says that a gift is \\"Any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full compensation (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return.\\"Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes, Internal Revenue Service When a taxable gift in the form of cash, stocks, real estate, or other tangible or intangible property is made, the tax is usually imposed on the donor (the giver) unless there is a retention of an interest which delays completion of the gift. A transfer is \\"completely gratuitous\\" when the donor receives nothing of value in exchange for the given property. A transfer is \\"gratuitous in part\\" when the donor receives some value but the value of the property received by the donor is substantially less than the value of the property given by the donor. In this case, the amount of the gift is the difference. In the United States, the gift tax is governed by Chapter 12, Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax is imposed by section 2501 of the Code.. For the purposes of taxable income, courts have defined a \\"gift\\" as the proceeds from a \\"detached and disinterested generosity.\\"Commissioner v. Duberstein, quoting Commissioner v. LoBue, 351 U.S. 243 (1956). Gifts are often given out of \\"affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.\\"Duberstein at 285 (quoting Robertson v. United States, 343 U.S. 711, 714 (1952)). Generally, if an interest in property is transferred during the giver's lifetime (often called an inter vivos gift), then the gift or transfer would not be subject to the estate tax. In 1976, Congress unified the gift and estate tax regimes, thereby limiting the giver's ability to circumvent the estate tax by giving during his or her lifetime. Some differences between estate and gift taxes remain, such as the effective tax rate, the amount of the credit available against tax, and the basis of the received property. There are also types of gifts which will be included in a person's estate, such as certain gifts made within the three-year window before death and gifts in which the donor retains an interest such as gifts of remainder interests that are not either qualified remainder trusts or charitable remainder trusts. The remainder interest gift tax rules impose the tax on the transfer of the entire value of the trust by assigning a zero value to the interest retained by the donor.  Non-taxable gifts  Generally, the following gifts are not taxable gifts: (Rev December 2009) * Gifts that are not more than the annual exclusion for the calendar year (last raised to $15,000 per recipient for any one donor, beginning for 2018) * Gifts to a political organization for its use * Gifts to charities * Gifts to one's (US Citizen) spouse * Tuition or medical expenses one pays directly to a medical or educational institution for someone. Donor must pay the expense directly. If donor writes a check to donee and donee then pays the expense, the gift may be subject to tax.  Exemptions  There are two levels of exemption from the gift tax. First, gifts of up to the annual exclusion ($14,000 per recipient for the years 2013 thru 2017 and $15,000 for 2018 thru 2020) incur no tax or filing requirement. By splitting their gifts, married couples can give up to twice this amount tax-free. Each giver and recipient pair has its own annual exclusion; a giver can give to any number of recipients and the exclusion is not affected by other gifts that recipient may have received from other givers. Second, gifts in excess of the annual exclusion may still be tax-free up to the lifetime estate basic exclusion amount ($11.58 million for 2020). For estates over that amount, however, such gifts might result in an increase in estate taxes. Taxpayers that expect to have a taxable estate may sometimes prefer to pay gift taxes as they occur, rather than saving them up as part of the estate. Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax if certain other criteria are met. Non-residents For gift tax purposes, the test is different in determining who is a non-resident alien, compared to the one for income tax purposes (the inquiry centers around the decedent's domicile). This is a subjective test that looks primarily at intent. The test considers factors such as the length of stay in the United States; frequency of travel, size, and cost of home in the United States; location of family; participation in community activities; participation in U.S. business and ownership of assets in the United States; and voting. It is possible for a foreign citizen to be considered a U.S. resident for income tax purposes but not for gift tax purposes. If a person is a non-resident alien for purposes of gift tax, taxation of gifts is determined in a different way. If the property is not located in the U.S., there is no gift tax. If it is intangible property, such as shares in U.S. corporations and interests in partnerships or LLCs, there is no gift tax. Non-resident alien donors are allowed the same annual gift tax exclusion as other taxpayers ($14,000 per year for 2013 through 2016). Non- resident alien donors do not have a lifetime unified credit. Non-resident alien donors are subject to the same rate schedule for gift taxes. U.S. citizens and residents must report gifts from a non-resident alien that are in excess of $100,000 on Form 3520. =Noncitizen spouse= According to 26 USC section 2523(i), gifts to a non-U.S.-citizen spouse are not generally exempt from gift tax. Instead, they are exempt only up to a specified amount foreseen by 26 USC section 2503 (b) (that is, up to $155,000 for 2019 IRS Revenue Procedure 2018-57 https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-18-57.pdf). U.S. Federal gift tax contrasted with U.S. Federal income tax treatment of gifts Pursuant to 26 USC 102(c), the receipt of a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance is not included in gross income. Thus, a taxpayer does not include the value of the gift when filing an income tax return. Although many items might appear to be gift, courts have held the most critical factor is the transferor's intent.Bogardus v. Commissioner, 302 U.S. 34, 43, 58 S.Ct. 61, 65, 82 L.Ed. 32 (1937). The transferor must demonstrate a \\"detached and disinterested generosity\\" when giving the gift to exclude the value of the gift from the taxpayer's gross income.Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. LoBue, 352 U.S. 243, 246, 76 S.Ct. 800, 803, 100 L.Ed. 1142 (1956). The courts have defined \\"gift\\" as proceeds from a \\"detached and disinterested generosity.\\"See (quoting ). \\"Gifts\\" received from employers that benefit employees are not excluded from taxation. clearly states employers cannot exclude as a gift anything transferred to an employee that benefits the employee. Consequently, an employer cannot \\"gift\\" an employee's salary to avoid taxation. Gifts from certain parties will always be taxed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Under Internal Revenue Code section 102(c), gifts transferred by or for an employer to, or for the benefit of, an employee cannot be excluded from the gross income of the employee for Federal income tax purposes. While there are some statutory exemptions under this rule for de minimis fringe amounts, and for achievement awards, the general rule is the employee must report a \\"gift\\" from the employer as income for Federal income tax purposes. The foundation for the preceding rule is the presumption that employers do not give employees items of value out of \\"detached and disinterested generosity\\" due to the existing employment relationship. Under Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(1), income subsequently derived from any property received as a gift is not excludable from the income taxed to the recipient. In addition, under Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(2), a donor may not circumvent this requirement by giving only the income and not the property itself to the recipient. Thus, a gift of income is always income to the recipient. Permitting such an exclusion would allow the donor and the recipient to avoid paying taxes on the income received, a loophole Congress has chosen to eliminate. History The gift tax is a backstop to the United States estate tax. Without the gift tax, large estates could be reduced by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential estate tax. Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime gift tax exclusion. Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 at a much lower rate than the estate tax, a full 25% under the estate tax rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under estate tax.Cooper, Jeffrey A. \\"Ghosts of 1932\\", in Florida Tax Review (Vol 9, Number 10, 2010), p.913. The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the estate tax rate.Cooper, pp.913-914. The intention was to rapidly generate revenue in the Great Depression, effectively encouraging avoidance of the estate tax by doing so, while lawmakers at the same time publicly, and in both House and Senate, proclaimed the exact opposite objective.Cooper, pp.912-913. Moreover, this was directly at the expense of state tax revenues, as well as of future federal tax revenues.Cooper, p.914. The primary beneficiaries were the wealthiest citizens, whom the estate tax was supposedly designed to target, since only they had enough money to freely make large gifts.Cooper, p.915. This was the express intention.Cooper, p.915 fn 171.

It was one of the novels in the series which was adapted into the 1967 film Doctor Dolittle. Plot John Dolittle, MD, is a respected physician and quiet bachelor living with his spinster sister Sarah in the small English village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. His love of animals grows over the years and his household menagerie eventually scares off his human clientele, leading to loss of wealth. But after learning the secret of speaking to all animals from his parrot Polynesia, he takes up veterinary practice. His fortunes rise and fall again after a crocodile takes up residence, leading to his sister leaving in disgust with the intention of getting married, but his fame in the animal kingdom spreads throughout the world. He is conscripted into voyaging to Africa to cure a monkey epidemic just as he faces bankruptcy. He has to borrow supplies and a ship, and sails with a crew of his favourite animals, but is shipwrecked upon arriving to Africa. On the way to the monkey kingdom, his band is arrested by the king of Jolliginki, a victim of European exploitation who wants no white men travelling in his country. The band barely escapes by ruse, but makes it to the monkey kingdom where things are dire indeed as a result of the raging epidemic. He vaccinates the well monkeys and nurses the sick back to health. In appreciation, the monkeys find the pushmi-pullyu, a shy two- headed gazelle-unicorn cross, whose rarity may bring Dr. Dolittle money back home. On the return trip, they again are captured in Jolliginki. This time they escape with the help of Prince Bumpo, who gives them a ship in exchange for Dolittle's bleaching Bumpo's face white, his greatest desire being to act as a European fairy-tale prince. Dolittle's crew then have a couple of run-ins with pirates, leading to Dolittle's winning a pirate ship loaded with treasures and rescuing a boy whose uncle was abandoned on a rock island. After reuniting the two, Dolittle finally makes it home and tours with the pushmi- pullyu in a circus until he makes enough money to retire to his beloved home in Puddleby.

Based on the novel of the same name by Howard Fast, it stars Jeff Daniels as George Washington. Also appearing in the film are Roger Rees as Hugh Mercer, Sebastian Roche as John Glover and Steven McCarthy as Alexander Hamilton. Plot After repeated losses and defeats during the American Revolutionary War's campaign of 1776, the Continental Army retreats across New Jersey. After the army narrowly escapes across the river to the Pennsylvania shore, Washington meets with his officers. In the past six months, they have lost New York City and been chased through New Jersey by the British, and 90% of their troops have either been killed, taken prisoner, or deserted. In possession of the only boats of any use on that stretch of the Delaware River, the army has a reprieve from further pursuit until the river freezes and they must retreat again, leaving Philadelphia open to capture. Compounding their problems, Washington's closest friend, General Hugh Mercer (a physician in civilian life), reminds him that their supplies of food, medicine, ammunition and winter clothing are dangerously low. Realizing that something must be done or the Revolution will collapse, Washington conceives a plan to cross the river and conduct a surprise attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton. The situation makes the plan appear all but impossible to Colonel John Glover, but due to his loyalty to Washington, he agrees to take the army across. When Washington proposes this operation to his staff, General Gates scoffs at its possibility, going over the line by calling Washington insane and unfit for command. Furious, Washington dismisses Gates from the camp at gunpoint, ordering him into silence. The rest of the staff laughs, but Washington and Glover silence them with the lack of advantages they have. On Christmas night, the Hessians will be feasting and drinking, so the morning after, hopefully still in darkness, the Continentals must take the fight to them while they are sluggish and hung over. The officers have only a few days to prepare their troops and weapons, and the soldiers, until it is time to cross, must be told no more than necessary. Despite their own fatigue and the winter weather, Washington manages to lift his weary soldiers' spirits, allowing the army to cross the river on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776. The crossing is done in one night, allowing the troops to attack Trenton at eight o' clock in the morning on December 26, 1776, and achieve a stunning victory, capturing almost all the Hessian garrison. The film claims that none of Washington's men were killed or even wounded. However, the Army's standard military history textbook, ROTCM 145-20, \\"American Military History 1607-1958,\\" states on page 61 that in fact two were killed in action, two were wounded, and two men froze to death during the operation.

The ensemble cast includes Idris Elba, Oris Erhuero, Carole Karemera, and Debra Winger. Plot The story revolves around Augustin Muganza, a Hutu who struggles to find closure after bearing witness to the killing of close to a million people in 100 days while becoming divided by politics and losing some of their own family. The plot intersperses between the genocide in 1994, and April 2004, when Augustin is invited by his brother, Honor√© Butera, to visit him as he stands trial for his involvement in the genocide. The film depicts the attitudes and circumstances leading up to the outbreak of brutal violence, the intertwining stories of people struggling to survive the genocide, and the aftermath as the people try to find justice and reconciliation. The plot is also intercut with scenes of Prudence Bushnell, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs for American President Bill Clinton, and her failed attempts to stop the genocide and advise the American government and public to acknowledge the unfolding genocide. = 1994 = Augustin, a captain in the Rwandan Armed Forces, lives in Kigali with his wife Jeanne, a Tutsi hospital worker with whom they have two sons, Yves-Andr√© and Marcus, and a daughter, Anne-Marie, who is staying in an all-girls Catholic boarding school 150 kilometres from Kigali. Despite constant political disagreement, he remains in close contact with Honor√©, a pro-Hutu Power radio personality working for Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). Augustin is also friends with Xavier Miango, a fellow Hutu officer and fianc√© to Felicie, a Tutsi. By April 1994, the power-sharing agreement between the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government and Paul Kagame's Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is breaking down as President Juv√©nal Habyarimana is viewed by Hutus to be conceding too far in favor of the Tutsis. Augustin and Xavier gradually come to the distressing realization that the military is preparing for targeted killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus on the behest of Hutu extremists in the government, but Augustin insists on taking the position of a moderate and remaining in the country to Jeanne's disapproval, despite history of anti-Tutsi violence by hardline Hutus earlier in the Rwandan Civil War and warnings from Honor√© that violent action from Hutu extremists may recur. On the night of April 6, Habyarimana is killed when his plane is shot down, reigniting the civil war and signaling the start of mass killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by g√©nocidaires comprising pro-Hutu government soldiers and militiamen backed by Hutu extremists, who were prior civilians, indoctrinated by Hutu Power propaganda; the following morning, Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana is assassinated by government soldiers. In response to the outbreak of violence, Xavier and Felicie seek refuge at Augustin's home. Fearing danger to his family, Augustin calls on Honor√© to use his influence in the community to safely transport his family and Felicie to the H√¥tel des Mille Collines, which is harboring refugees, while confident that Anne-Marie is out of harm's way. As Augustin learns from Honor√© that he is documented as a Tutsi sympathizer by the government, he elects to stay at home alongside Xavier until it is safe to head to the hotel. On route, Honor√© manages to slip his passengers through g√©nocidaire roadblocks, but is stopped at an unexpected military checkpoint, where the group is detained and a scuffle ensues. After a few days of hiding, Augustin and Xavier escape the house and trail a UNAMIR convoy evacuating expatriates, but are separated from the convoy at a militia roadblock when the officer in charge of the convoy refuses to help. Augustin's life is spared but Xavier is executed as he has been branded a traitor on the radio. Augustin eventually reaches the hotel but is unable to locate his family, and remains there for the rest of the genocide. Meanwhile, Jeanne awakens in shock without her sons at the Sainte-Famille Church over a week after the altercation at the checkpoint. Felicie is later seen lined up for execution by the church building. G√©nocidaires eventually breach the school Anne-Marie resides at to screen for Tutsi elements. Martine, a teacher at the school, shelters a group of students, including Anne-Marie, in a dormitory. The students rally behind Martine in solidarity as Martine refuses to divide them into Hutus and Tutsis, only for the group to be indiscriminately slaughtered by gunfire from government soldiers. Martine and Victorine, a fellow student, survive and find Anne-Marie alive but mortally wounded; as they escape, Anne-Marie eventually dies. The two soon find safety among the thick vegetation of the Kayumba swamps, where they are rescued by advancing RPF soldiers. Towards late-July, the RPF has scored massive territorial gains as members of the Hutu political and military elite and Hutu civilians flee the country out of fear of reprisal from the RPF, ending the civil war and the genocide. Augustin seeks out Anne-Marie at her school, only to find Martine and another woman tending to bodies in the dormitory where the massacre occurred. He grieves when Martine confirms that Anne-Marie is dead. = 2004 = Haunted by the events in 1994 and resigning to never learn of what had become of Jeanne and his sons, Augustin finds work as a school teacher and lives unmarried with Martine, who remains traumatized by her experience at her old school. Around the tenth anniversary of the start of the genocide, Augustin receives a letter from Honor√© expressing interest to discuss in person the fates of Jeanne and his first sons. Honor√© has been detained in Arusha, Tanzania, where he is tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his role at RTLM, after being on the run until his arrest in Italy in 1997. On Martine's insistence, Augustin reluctantly flies to Tanzania to attend the trial hearings as a visitor, dithering to meet Honor√©. Furious to learn that those charged for inciting the genocide live in relative luxury with ample medication and meals while his countrymen still struggle to survive, Augustin begins to question the point of his visit. His stance softens when he befriends Valentine, another genocide survivor. She invites him to listen to her testify in court as an anonymous witness, where he hears of the constant rape she endured in the hands of Interahamwe militiamen. Valentine is revealed to be mothering two sons. Inspired by Valentine's courage to testify, Augustin is motivated to meet Honor√©. At the meeting, Honor√© recounts the events that unfolded at the checkpoint to the hotel in 1994: The soldiers were ordered to kill Jeanne, Yves-Andr√© and Marcus due to their Tutsi lineage. Augustin's sons were promptly shot dead, but in their excitement, the soldiers presumed Jeanne was also dead despite only being knocked unconscious by a rifle butt. Honor√© hid Jeanne in a ditch, before carrying her to the safety of the church at night. For objecting to the kill order, Honor√© was listed as a traitor and lost his privilege for safety, forcing him into exile and being unable to aid Jeanne any further. Honor√© would later learn that while Jeanne was initially safe and pleaded to join Augustin at the hotel, she was raped by soldiers after the military began to probe the church for Tutsis. With the imminent threat of being killed, Jeanne sacrificed herself with a grenade to save a few rape victims and inflict injury on her aggressors. Reflecting on Honor√©'s revelation, Augustin finally finds peace and returns to Rwanda to raise his new family with Martine, who is now expecting a son. The film closes with Martine laying flowers at the remains of the school dormitory before attending a nearby Gacaca court to recount her experiences in the genocide.

Paul Bonerwitz is one of the speakers. In contrast to Hotel Rwanda, which was rated PG-13 and had most of the genocide violence subtly implied rather than explicitly shown, this film was noted for its more gruesome and graphic portrayal of the violence, which gave it a TV-MA rating. In addition, various scenes set in Rwanda were shot in location in and around Kigali, with prominent landmarks such as H√¥tel des Mille Collines and the Sainte-Famille Church featured.

The gun crew worked from a raised platform with a modest amount of protection from the sides - the twin 20 mm gun fired through a large Gun shield gave further protection for the crew from that direction.

From 1972 to 1995, he taught at the Faculty of Medicine in Abidjan. During his career, he supervised about 40 doctoral theses in medicine, wrote over fifty medical articles/reports, helped train many doctors, and served as a senior physician in several hospitals. He was a consultant for the World Health Organization (WHO), and joined the organization in 1995. From 1998 to 2001, he was responsible for the Development of Human Resources for Health unit in the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa. In 2001, three months before his death, he assumed the post of World Health Organization Representative in Burundi. Death The badly beaten body of Kassi Manlan was found in the shallows of Lake Tanganyika, near a sailing club, on November 20, 2001. He was killed when he discovered a scam that diverted aid money from the purchase of malaria drugs to private bank accounts. Thirteen people were convicted of the murder, including Gertrude Nyamoya, a former employee of Kassi Manlan; Gerard Ntunzwenayo, deputy administrator of Burundi's secret service; and Major Emile Manisha, director general of the public security police.

Debs' campaign from prison satirizes Harding's front porch campaign in the Election of 1920. A front porch campaign is a low-key electoral campaign used in American politics in which the candidate remains close to or at home to make speeches to supporters who come to visit. The candidate largely does not travel around or otherwise actively campaign.\\"Front-Porch Campaign.\\" Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com, n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2012. The successful presidential campaigns of James A. Garfield in 1880, Benjamin Harrison in 1888, and William McKinley in 1896 are perhaps the best-known front porch campaigns. McKinley's opposing candidate, William Jennings Bryan, gave over 600 speeches and traveled many miles all over the United States to campaign, but McKinley outdid this by spending about twice as much money campaigning. While McKinley was at his Canton, Ohio, home conducting his \\"front-porch campaign\\", Mark Hanna was out raising millions to help with the campaign. Another president that has been known for his front porch campaign was Warren G. Harding during the presidential election of 1920. In 2020, Joe Biden's presidential campaign shifted to a front-porch style during the summer. The candidate has used videoconferencing technology to fundraise and speak to supporters and the media from his home in Delaware during the COVID-19 pandemic given the imposition of stay at home orders (including in the candidate's home state) and that rallies were impractical due to social distancing guidelines.

The Ohio Historical Society, 2003. Web. 14 Dec. 2012. These speeches started as organized meetings between McKinley and delegations from all over the nation. Although it was expensive for the campaign to bring these delegations, all in all, this idea became a good strategy because of the publicity it generated. In addition, due to the fact that McKinley's campaign chose those who would travel as part of the delegation, it was possible to make those who spoke portray McKinley positively.

He and his father James Wright are the only parent/child pair to have won the Pulitzer Prize in the same category. Life and career Wright was born in Vienna, Austria. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1977. Wheeling Motel (Knopf, 2009), had selections put to music for the record Readings from Wheeling Motel. Wright wrote the lyrics to and performs the Clem Snide song \\"Encounter at 3AM\\" on the album Hungry Bird (2009). Wright's most recent books include Kindertotenwald (Knopf, 2011), a collection of sixty-five prose poems concluding with a love poem to his wife, written while Wright had terminal lung cancer. The poem won Poetry magazine's premier annual literary prize for best work published in the magazine during 2011. The prose poem collection was followed in 2012 by Buson: Haiku, a collection of translations of 30 haiku by the Japanese poet Yosa Buson, published in a limited edition of a few hundred copies by Tavern Books. In 2013 Wright's primary publisher, Knopf in New York, brought out another full length collection of verse and prose poems, F, which was begun in the ICU of a Boston hospital after excision of part of a lung. F was the most positively received of any of Wright's work. Writing in the Huffington Post, Anis Shivani placed it among the best books of poetry yet produced by an American, and called Wright \\"our greatest contemporary poet.\\" In 2013 Wright recorded 15 prose poems from Kindertotenwald for inclusion in a series of improvisational concerts performed in European venues, arranged by David Sylvian, Stephan Mathieu and Christian Fennesz. Prior to his death, Wright completed his final manuscript, entitled \\"Axe in Blossom,\\" which is forthcoming from Knopf. Wright has been anthologised in works such as The Best of the Best American Poetry as well as Czeslaw Milosz's anthology A Book of Luminous Things Bearing the Mystery: Twenty Years of Image,\\"Language as Sacrament in the New Testament\\" Editor Gregory Wolfe, Wm.

[His poems'] best forms of originality [are] deftness in patterning, startling metaphors, starkness of speech, compression of both pain and joy, and a stoic self-possession with the agonies and penalties of existence.\\" Novelist Denis Johnson has said Wright's poems \\"are like tiny jewels shaped by blunt, ruined fingersmiraculous gifts.\\" The Boston Review has called Wright's poetry \\"among the most honest, haunting, and human being written today.\\"Boston Review Poet and critic Ernest Hilbert wrote for Random House's magazine Bold Type that \\"Wright oscillates between direct and evasive dictions, between the barroom floor and the arts club podium, from aphoristic aside to icily poetic abstraction.\\" Walking to Martha's Vineyard (2003) in particular, was well received. According to Publishers Weekly, the collection features \\"[h]eartfelt but often cryptic poems...fans will find Wright's self-diagnostics moving throughout.\\"\\"WALKING TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD\\" Publishers Weekly September 1, 2003 The New York Times noted that Wright promises, and can deliver, great depths of feeling, while observing that Wright depends very much on our sense of his tone, and on our belief not just that he means what he says but that he has said something new...[on this score] Walking to Martha's Vineyard sometimes succeeds.\\" Poet Jordan Davis, writing for The Constant Critic, suggested that Wright's collection was so accomplished it would have to be kept \\"out of the reach of impulse kleptomaniacs.\\" Added Davis, \\"deader than deadpan, any particular Wright poem may not seem like much, until, that is, you read a few of them. Once the context kicks in, you may find yourself trying to track down every word he's written.\\" Some critics were less welcoming. According to New Criterion critic William Logan, with whom Wright would later publicly feud, \\"[t]his poet is surprisingly vague about the specifics of his torment (most of his poems are shouts and curses in the dark). He was cruelly affected by the divorce of his parents, though perhaps after forty years there should be a statute of limitation... 'The Only Animal,' the most accomplished poem in the book, collapses into the same kitschy sanctimoniousness that puts nodding Jesus dolls on car dashboards.\\" \\"Wright offers the crude, unprocessed sewage of suffering\\", he comments. \\"He has drunk harder and drugged harder than any dozen poets in our health-conscious age, and paid the penalty in hospitals and mental wards.\\" The critical reception of Wright's 2011 collection, Kindertotenwald (Knopf), has been positive on the whole. Writing in the Washington Independent Book Review, Grace Cavalieri speaks of the book as a departure from Wright's best known poems. \\"The prose poems are intriguing thought patterns that show poetry as mental process... This is original material, and if a great poet cannot continue to be original, then he is really not all that great... In this text there is a joyfulness that energizes and makes us feel the writing as a purposeful surge. It is a life force. This is a good indicator of literary art... Memory and the past, mortality, longing, childhood, time, space, geography and loneliness, are all the poet's playthings. In these conversations with himself, Franz Wright shows how the mind works with his feelings and his brain's agility in its struggle with the heart.\\" Cultural critic for the Chicago Tribune Julia Keller says that Kindertotenwald is \\"ultimately about joy and grace and the possibility of redemption, about coming out whole on the other side of emotional catastrophe.\\" \\"This collection, like all of Wright's book, combines familiar, colloquial phrasesthe daily lingo you hear everywherewith the sudden sharpness of a phrase you've never heard anywhere, but that sounds just as familiar, just as inevitable. These pieces are written in closely packed prose, like miniature short stories, but they have a fierce lilting beauty that marks them as poetry. Reading 'Kindertotenwald' is like walking through a plate-glass window on purpose. There ispredictablypain, but once you've made it a few steps past the threshold, you realize it wasn't glass after all, only air, and that the shattering sound you heard was your own heart breaking. Healing, though, is possible. \\"Soon, soon,\\" the poet writes in \\"Nude With Handgun and Rosary,\\" \\"between one instant and the next, you will be well.\\" Awards 1985, 1992 National Endowment for the Arts grant * 1989 Guggenheim Fellowship * 1991 Whiting Award * 1996 PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry * 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, for Walking to Martha's Vineyard Selected worksThe Toy Throne, Tungsten Press (2015) *The Writing, Argos Books, 2015, *The Raising of Lazarus, Tungsten Press (2014) *F, Knopf, 2013 *Kindertotenwald Alfred A.

Fly-ins may be formally or informally organised, members of the public may or may not be invited, the gathering may be at an airport or in a farmer's field. Fly-ins can be aimed at specific aircraft classes, such as taildraggers, warbirds, experimental aircraft or specific aircraft models. They may be organized by a national organization, such as the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association or the Experimental Aircraft Association, the airport owner or authority, a flying club, an aircraft type club or by a group of friends meeting perhaps for a barbecue and to socialize. The term \\"fly-in\\" is not formally defined in the aviation legislation of many countries and it may refer to a range of events, while in others it has a specific legal meaning. For example, in Canada fly-ins may not legally include air displays or competitive flying. History Poster for the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne A fly-in of Short Wing Piper aircraft from an Aircraft type club. The aircraft are (l-r) a Piper PA-17 Vagabond, a Piper PA-16 Clipper and a Piper PA-22-150 Tri-Pacer Both fly-ins and airshows evolved out of the first aviation meets held in the pioneering days of flying, early in the twentieth century, before the First World War. Although there were some minor aviation meets in France earlier in 1909, at Port-Aviation south of Paris, in Douai and in Vichy, the first major international aviation meet was the Grande Semaine d'Aviation (English: Grand Week of Aviation) held in Reims, France between 22‚Äì29 August 1909. The event attracted some of the world's foremost pilots of the day, including Louis Bl√©riot, Henry Farman, L√©on Delagrange, Hubert Latham, Charles de Lambert, Louis Paulhan, Roger Sommer, Claude Grahame-White and one American, Glenn Curtiss. The event was primarily a competition for record setting. Curtis set a speed record of flying a biplane he had designed, winning the first race for Gordon Bennett Coupe Internationale d'Aviation. Henry Farman set a distance record of in just over three hours. Hubert Latham won the altitude contest by attaining . The event attracted large crowds of spectators including 3,000 from the United Kingdom and 2,000 from the United States. None of the aircraft were flown-in, but arrived via ground transport and assembled in place.Villard, Henry Serrano & Willis M. Allen Jr: Looping The Loop, pages 42-54. Kales Press, 2000. The first person to actually fly into an aviation meeting was Hubert Latham, who flew to the 1909 Konkurrenz-Fliegen Berlin at Johannisthal Air Field from the Tempelhof field on 27 September 1909, a distance of . This was one of the several meetings inspired by the Reims meeting. Latham's flight was the first cross-country flight in Germany. Flying to aviation meetings was sometimes discouraged. For example, Robert Martinet wanted to fly his plane to the June 1910 Angers aviation meeting, but was refused by the organizers, on the grounds that this potentially dangerous flight would put his appearance at the meeting at risk.Le Petit Courrier (1 June 1910, page 2) The expression in English most commonly used for similar events in the pre-World War I era was \\"aviation meeting\\" (in Europe) or \\"aviation meet\\" (in the USA). The first aviation meet located in the United Kingdom was held at Doncaster between 15‚Äì23 October 1909. It preceded the second UK event held at Blackpool by only three days. Both events competed for the honour of being the first of their type in the country and as a result neither drew the expected public interest. The Doncaster event attracted a dozen aircraft and pilots, but bad weather prevented much of the planned flying and many of the trophies were not awarded. The event lost a considerable amount of money. The first major competitive aviation meet held in the United States was the Los Angeles Aviation Meet, held 10‚Äì20 January 1910 at Dominguez Field. Again this was a competition-style meet with almost all the aircraft from France. Louis Paulhan set a height record of just under one mile (1.6 km) and also took the prize for endurance with a flight of 1:49:40 that covered . The first African aviation meet was the Grande Semaine d'Aviation d'Egypt held at Heliopolis, east of Cairo, 6‚Äì13 February 1910. The event took advantage of the good winter weather found in that country and attracted fliers from all over Europe. The event was organized by the Aero Club of Egypt assisted by the Aero Club de France and was sponsored by Prince Pasha, uncle of the Khedive of Egypt. Pilots flew from an aerodrome that was staked out in the desert that had a landing and take-off surface that was by wide. Competitions were flown between the twelve pilots participating and 173,000 Francs in prize money was disbursed. One participant was \\"Baroness\\" Raymonde de Laroche, the first woman in the world to earn a pilot's licence, who won a 10,000 Franc prize for her flight of . The People's Republic of China has been a difficult environment for general aviation, having had severe limits placed on it in the communist era, but by 2011 the government agreed to lift restrictions and to promote the use of business and personal aviation. China's first fly-in was to be held 20‚Äì24 September 2011 in Beijing as part of a five-day conference on general aviation, but the fly-in was \\"postponed indefinitely\\" due to a Beijing Police Department helicopter crash that raised safety concerns. Switzerland's fly-ins include the one from La C√¥te, near Prangins, which was held each every 2 years since 2007, organized by the local air-club \\"Club A√©ronautique Swissair Gen√®ve\\" (CASG).

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was the Grammy award winning older brother of former Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick. Early career and Kiss Bob Kulick took a chance in late 1972 and auditioned for the lead guitar spot in a then-new band called Kiss. The band, with Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss, was very impressed by his performance, however the glitzier Ace Frehley (who auditioned immediately after him) was chosen to fill the spot. Kulick later played (uncredited) on three Kiss albums: Alive II (three of the five studio tracks), Killers (all four new studio tracks), and some minimal work on Creatures of the Night. He also played on Paul Stanley's 1978 solo album and on his 1989 solo tour. Other work Kulick in 1986 Early in his session career, Bob Kulick played lead guitar for Lou Reed on his Coney Island Baby record. Kulick followed this up with a long-running stint in the Neverland Express, Meat Loaf's touring band, on and off for years, which led to appearances on several Meat Loaf albums, most notably on 1984's Bad Attitude. He also formed a band called Balance, with Peppy Castro (aka Emil \\"Peppy\\" Thielhelm, formerly of the Blues Magoos) and Doug Katsaros (multi- platinum recording arranger and Broadway conductor), which had modest chart success in the early 1980s, followed up by playing rhythm and lead guitar on Michael Bolton's 1983 self-titled album. Bob Kulick was involved with a project called Skull, releasing one album, No Bones About It, in 1991. Bruce Kulick, his brother, who would become a member of KISS, co-wrote one song and appeared as a guest guitarist on another track. In addition, Kulick played on the W.A.S.P. albums The Crimson Idol and Still Not Black Enough. He was only involved with the studio work and never toured with W.A.S.P. or became a member of the band. In 1996 he released Murderer's Row with his band of the same name. This group included David Glen Eisley (of Giuffria and Dirty White Boy) on vocals. Thereafter, Kulick served in various side projects such as Blackthorne and Observation Balloon. He also produced Mot√∂rhead's \\"Whiplash\\" (winner of the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance), produced and played guitar on the theme for WWE wrestler Triple H, and earned 11 platinum or gold records working with Kiss and Diana Ross. Kulick also composed, produced, and performed \\"Sweet Victory\\" with Eisley in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Band Geeks\\" on Nickelodeon. The song further appears on SpongeBob SquarePants: The Yellow Album. Personal life In 1983 Kulick began a long-term relationship with actress Stella Stevens. Kulick resided in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was a regular participant in the annual \\"KISS Night in Las Vegas\\" fundraiser for music programs in Clark County, Nevada schools until his death.

Her novel Property (2003) won the Orange Prize for Fiction. In 2012, The Observer named Property as one of \\"The 10 best historical novels\\". Early life Martin was born in Sedalia, Missouri, to John Roger Metcalf and Valerie Fleischer Metcalf. Her father was a sea captain and her mother was a housewife whose family goes back several generations in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was raised in New Orleans from the age of three, attending public elementary school and a Catholic high school (Mount Carmel Academy). She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of New Orleans in 1970 and graduated from the MFA Program for Poets & Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1974. In the 1970s, Martin took a writing course at Loyola University New Orleans taught by Southern novelist Walker Percy. Academic career Martin has taught at multiple colleges and universities in the United States, in both visiting and tenure-track positions. * 1978‚Äì1979: University of New Mexico, Las Cruces (visiting lecturer in creative writing) * 1980‚Äì1984 and 1985‚Äì1986: University of New Orleans (assistant professor of English) * 1984‚Äì1985: University of Alabama (writer-in-residence/visiting associate professor) * 1986‚Äì1989: Mount Holyoke College (lecturer in creative writing) * 1989‚Äì1997: University of Massachusetts Amherst (associate professor of English) * 1998‚Äì1999: Loyola University New Orleans (visiting writer-in- residence) * 1999 and 2002: Sarah Lawrence College (visiting writer) * 2009‚Äìpresent: Mount Holyoke College (professor of English) While at the University of Alabama, Martin lived a few blocks away from novelist Margaret Atwood and they became friends. Martin was the first person to read the completed manuscript of Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, claiming she told Atwood that the book would make her rich. Atwood returned the favor and read some of Martin's then-unpublished works, and liked them enough to send them to editor and publisher Nan A. Talese, who has remained Martin's editor ever since. Writing career Martin's fictional works include Set in Motion (1978), Alexandra (1979), A Recent Martyr (1987), The Consolation of Nature and Other Stories (1988), The Great Divorce (1993), Italian Fever (1999), The Unfinished Novel and Other Stories (2006), Trespass (2007), and The Confessions of Edward Day (2009). She also wrote a biography of St. Francis of Assisi titled Salvation: Scenes from the Life of St. Francis (2001). Her most recent novel, The Ghost of the Mary Celeste, was published in 2014, and Sea Lovers: Selected Stories appeared in 2016. Her 1990 novel, Mary Reilly, a retelling of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the point of view of a servant in the doctor's house, won the Kafka Prize in 1990 and has been translated into 16 languages. It was released as a film in 1996 by Columbia TriStar Pictures, directed by Stephen Frears and starred John Malkovich as Dr. Jekyll and Julia Roberts as Mary. The short film Surface Calm (2001), directed by Michael Miley, is based on her short story of the same title from her first book, Love (1977). With her niece, poet Lisa Martin, she has written a trilogy of children's books about cats named Anton and Cecil. Personal life She was married to artist Robert M. Martin from 1970 until their divorce in 1984. They had one daughter, Adrienne, born in 1975. Martin currently resides in Dutchess County, New York with her partner John Cullen and her cat named Jackson Gray. She enjoys gardening. Martin has continued to teach at the college level even though her writing career has been successful, sometimes taking breaks from the classroom in order to complete a work. She says she needs the social activity of working with young authors to balance the solitary activity that is writing. She initially writes in longhand, later transferring the text to a computer.

It was formed in June 2003, by Chris Munns, who wanted to provide curling opportunities for those based in England (a country that at the time had no curling facilities whatsoever). This was achieved by club members regularly traveling to other countries within Europe to both train and compete. At the same time, the club actively campaigned for the introduction of curling facilities in England. In November 2004 the club was able to base itself at England's first ever dedicated curling rink when Fenton's Rink, near Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent, opened to the public. Privately owned, funded and built by a local landowner (and not any specific curling club) the rink is now at the heart of English curling.

U'Ren in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1898. U'Ren had been politically activated by reading the influential 1893 book Direct Legislation Through the Initiative and Referendum, and the group's founding followed in the wake of the 1896 founding of the National Direct Legislation League, which itself had its roots in the Direct Legislation League of New Jersey and its short-lived predecessor, the People's Power League. The group led efforts in Oregon to establish an initiative and referendum system, allowing direct legislation by the state's citizens. In 1902, the Oregon Legislative Assembly approved such a system, which was known at the time as the Oregon System. The group's further efforts led to successful ballot initiatives implementing a direct primary system in 1904, and allowing citizens to directly recall public officials in 1908.

Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston's Farewell to Manzanar devoted a chapter to the concept to explain why the Japanese Americans interned in the US during World War II did not put up more of a struggle against the restrictive conditions and policies put upon them. The historical manga Barefoot Gen shows many of the citizens in Hiroshima using the phrase \\"Shikata ga nai\\" to explain why they accept the military rule, and the acceptance of the below-poverty conditions that cause many of their citizens to starve. Similarly, John Hersey's Hiroshima applies the phrase after efforts to assist fatally injured hibakusha ceased. James Clavell used the phrase in his novel Sh≈çgun. The Japanese characters explain it to the westerner who comes to see its wisdom. The phrase is also introduced or explained by Japanese or Japanese-American characters in books such as David Guterson's Snow Falling on Cedars. In the book The Hostile Beaches by Gordon D. Shirreffs, the character Lieutenant Carney says the phrase. When asked what it means, he says it means \\"Let's get to work\\", not knowing its actual meaning.

White Heart's discography includes thirteen albums, the most recent of which was released in 1997. Original members Billy Smiley and Mark Gersmehl worked with a continually-changing cast of band-mates. In 1985, former roadie Rick Florian became the lead singer. Smiley started his own label, Cul-de-Sac Records. Gersmehl continues to write music and has released solo efforts. Florian is a real estate agent in the Franklin, Tennessee area and also continues to sing for various recording projects.  History  = Formation = White Heart formed in 1982 with two of its members coming from Bill Gaither's group. The first two albums were produced by Smiley and Huff, the two friends who formed the group and were listening to groups like Toto, Boz Scaggs, Journey, and Steely Dan at the time. The original lineup consisted of Billy Smiley (guitar, keyboards, and occasional lead vocals), Mark Gersmehl (keyboards and occasional lead vocals), Steve Green (lead vocals), Gary Lunn (bass), and brothers Dann and David Huff (guitars/vocals & drums respectively). Whiteheart was pursued by every major Christian label until Chris Christian heard their demo and signed them to Home Sweet Home Records and gave them their first record deal. By the time they released their third album, they were selling in excess of 250,000 albums. After their self-titled debut album was released in 1982, the band suffered its first lineup change. Green left the band, saying that rock was not his style. They went on to tour with David Meece and Farrell and Farrell for the next two years, building their fan base, with Scott Douglas as Green's replacement as lead vocalist. Green continued to sing background vocals on Vital Signs, and they had their first No. 1 single, We Are His Hands, with Douglas singing the lead, and Smiley and Green singing the harmonies. The band released its second album, \\"Vital Signs\\", in 1984. Douglas was with the band for two years before being charged with aggravated sexual battery on June 30, 1985. He was sentenced to prison in March 1986. Dann Huff left the band shortly after to pursue his dream of being a studio musician, and recommended his high school friend, Gordon Kennedy as his replacement for the WhiteHeart album, Hotline. Later, in 1985, David Huff left the band to pursue other interests as well, including touring with Michael W. Smith. Eventually, he would join his brother Dann to form the hard rock band Giant. = The Sparrow years = With Douglas gone, the remaining band members began to audition singers. In 1985, they were surprised when they saw and heard their stage manager and roadie, Rick Florian, dancing around on the stage and \\"karaoke\\" singing along to the song \\"Every Time You Go Away\\", which the sound company used to sonically tune the room each night during soundcheck. A few weeks later, Florian came up to Smiley and asked if he could audition for the lead vocalist position, and he was later chosen as Douglas' replacement. He became a core member of the band and continued through the rest of White Heart's discography. Chris McHugh was also picked up to fill the drummer seat. White Heart's 1986 release, Don't Wait for the Movie, was released with their first major headlining tour and had major support from Sparrow Records and Billy Ray Hearn, who had personally come out to meet and hopefully sign the band. He hired Smiley as the producer for the record. It continues to be one of the band's most successful selling albums with three No. 1 song, and breaking all previous album sales. The band kept on touring and recording. Gary Lunn left the band to become a studio musician and was replaced with Tommy Sims. After \\"Emergency Broadcast\\" was released in 1987, White Heart made an important change with Brown Bannister coming on as producer for their next album. Bannister was known for working with Amy Grant, recording out at the Bennett House in Franklin, TN. Because of the fractured approach to having each member producing songs for \\"Emergency Broadcast\\", Smiley suggested getting an outside presence that every member would respect and respond to. The band's album, 1989's \\"Freedom\\", featured a more original approach, with the band going to a rehearsal hall and working out all the material for three weeks before even going into the studio, and having Bannister help find the best songs, and pull the most out of each member both musically and vocally. \\"Freedom\\" has been hailed as one of White Heart's best ever. Songs like \\"The River Will Flow\\", \\"Let The Kingdom Come\\", \\"Over Me\\", \\"Bye Bye Babylon\\", and \\"Sing Your Freedom\\" would become live fan favorites for years to come. But stability remained elusive. The band reached the end of its contract with Sparrow Records and Brown Bannister. Also, Chris McHugh, Gordon Kennedy, and Tommy Sims left the band to become studio musicians. = The Star Song era = White Heart signed on with Star Song Records, and hired Brian Wooten (guitars), Anthony Sallee (bass), and Mark Nemer (drums) to fill the spots. With these pieces in place, the band released one of its best-known albums, \\"Powerhouse\\", in 1990. \\"Desert Rose\\", \\"Independence Day\\", and \\"Powerhouse\\" were No. 1 songs, and \\"Desert Rose\\" became one of their biggest anthems and career songs to date. Nemer left soon after and the band brought back former drummer Chris McHugh to do the drumming for \\"Tales of Wonder\\", with the exception of one song on which they used Jon Knox. The band released \\"Tales of Wonder\\" in 1992 produced by Smiley and Gersmehl. They also brought back Brown Bannister as a production adviser for the project and announced Jon Knox as their new drummer. White Heart followed this success with \\"Highlands\\" in 1993, which also received critical and commercial praise. Touring non-stop from the \\"Freedom\\" through the \\"Highlands\\" release, this period was the most rewarding and captivating time of their touring career. Anthony Sallee left the band and John Thorn was hired to replace him for the Highlands Tour. In 1994, the band released two compilation albums: \\"Nothing But the Best: Rock Classics\\" and \\"Radio Classics\\", which included two new songs each and marked the end of the band's contract with Star Song. = The Curb years = White Heart signed with a mainstream label, Curb Records, as the label's first foray into the Christian Music contemporary rock market. The band released \\"Inside\\" in 1995 and stylized their name as \\"Whiteheart\\". The album had mixed reviews from the Christian market, but was quite successful on the Christian radio charts and yielded several No. 1 singles in the Christian Radio Market: \\"Inside\\" and \\"Even the Hardest Heart\\" were both No. 1 songs. This album was notably produced and mixed by the legendary Ken Scott. This record marked an edgier sound and was also the band's launch through the newly created and now-defunct Warner Christian Distribution. The band's lineup continued to be a revolving door. Brian Wooten, John Thorn and Jon Knox all left to pursue other projects. The remaining core members (Smiley, Gersmehl, Florian) regrouped to consider the band's future. They released their final Curb album, \\"Redemption\\", in 1997 using studio musician friends. It received critical praise for its depth and musical maturity. After \\"Redemption\\", Smiley, Gersmehl and Florian entered what they called \\"a dormant or eternal sabbatical stage\\". They have not officially broken up Whiteheart, but each of them is working on separate personal projects as well as Smiley producing full-time. Florian issued a statement in 1999 regarding the future of the band. On August 25, 2006, White Heart received a Soul2Soul Honor award in New Albany, Indiana. Billy Smiley, Rick Florian, Mark Gersmehl, Tommy Sims, Jon Knox and Gordon Kennedy reunited to perform \\"Over Me\\" and \\"Sing Your Freedom\\". According to Florian, it was the first time in 17 years that particular combination of musicians had performed together, although Knox had never actually been in the band at the same time as Sims or Kennedy. In July 2013 the band announced their first full concert since 1998 would be at Easterfest in Toowoomba, Australia on April 19, 2014. After Easterfest, a limited reunion US tour was announced, originally planned for late 2014. The tour was postponed to early 2015. Several venues were selected and tickets were sold, however, on January 13, 2015, the band announced the tour would have to be canceled due to circumstances beyond their control, and all tickets were refunded. Florian, Gershmehl, Kennedy, McHugh, and Sims performed a benefit concert in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the release of \\"Freedom\\" on June 29, 2019, at the New Hope Community Church in Brentwood, Tennessee. Scott Bernard, who joined White Heart for the Australian Easterfest concert in 2014, handled Smiley's original album guitar parts. The album's producer, Brown Bannister, was also present, and vocalist Bart Millard of MercyMe acted as emcee for the evening.  Honors  Although White Heart is considered one of the premier bands to ever play contemporary Christian music, and despite the many No. 1 hits and albums, they have never won a Dove Award. White Heart was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame on November 6, 2010.As noted on the website of The Christian Music Hall of Fame.

United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court redefined what constitutes \\"searches\\" and \\"seizures\\" with regard to the protections of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The decision expanded the Fourth Amendment's protections from the right of search and seizures of an individual's \\"persons, houses, papers, and effects\\", as defined in the Constitution, to include \\"what [a person] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public\\" as a constitutionally protected area. The case introduced the Katz test to determine a reasonable expectation of privacy, defined as a two-part test written in a concurrence by Justice John Marshall Harlan II. The Katz test has been used in thousands of cases, particularly with the advancement of technology that poses new questions on expectations of privacy. Background Charles Katz was a resident of Los Angeles, California, who had long been involved in sports betting. By the mid-1960s, he had become \\"probably the preeminent college basketball handicapper in America.\\" In February 1965, Katz on several occasions used a public telephone booth near his apartment on Sunset Boulevard to provide his gambling handicaps to bookmakers in Boston and Miami. Unbeknownst to him, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had begun investigating his gambling activities, and was recording his conversations via a covert listening device attached to the outside of the phone booth. After recording a number of his phone calls, FBI agents arrested Katz and charged him with eight counts of knowingly transmitting wagering information over telephone between U.S. states, which is a federal crime under . Katz was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Katz's lawyer made a motion to have the court suppress the FBI's recordings as evidence, arguing that because the FBI agents did not have a search warrant allowing them to place their listening device, the recordings had been made in violation of the Fourth Amendment and should be inadmissible per the exclusionary rule. The judge denied his motion and ruled that the recordings were admissible, and Katz was convicted based on them. Katz appealed his conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In November 1966, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed Katz's conviction, ruling that because the FBI's eavesdropping device did not physically penetrate the telephone booth's wall, no Fourth Amendment search occurred, and so the FBI did not need a search warrant to place the device. Katz then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case and ordered certiorari. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case in October 1967, and took the unusual step of giving each party a full hour to argue their side. Decision On December 18, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a 7‚Äì1 decision in favor of Katz that invalidated the FBI's wiretap and overturned Katz's conviction. Newly-appointed Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself from the case to avoid a conflict of interest because, as the previous U.S. Solicitor General, he had authored the U.S. government's brief in opposition to Katz prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court. =Opinion of the Court= Justice Potter Stewart, who authored the Court's opinion in Katz Seven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice Potter Stewart. The Court began by dismissing the parties' characterization of the case in terms of traditional trespass-based analysis that hinged on, first, whether the public telephone booth Katz had used was a \\"constitutionally protected area\\" where he had a \\"right of privacy\\", and second, on whether the FBI had \\"physically penetrated\\" the protected area and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the Court viewed the situation through the lens of how Katz's use of the phone booth would be perceived by himself and then objectively by others. In a now well-known passage, Stewart wrote: The Court then briefly surveyed the history of American jurisprudence on governmental searches and seizures. It described how American courts had traditionally analyzed Fourth Amendment searches by analogizing them to the long-established doctrine of trespass. In their legal briefs, the parties had focused on the 1928 case Olmstead v. United States, in which the Court had ruled that surveillance by wiretap without any trespass did not constitute a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. However, the Court stated that in later cases it had begun recognizing that the Fourth Amendment governed even recorded speech obtained without any physical trespassing, and that the law had evolved. The Court wrote: Stewart then concluded the Court's opinion by ruling that even though the FBI knew there was a \\"strong probability\\" that Katz was breaking the law with the phone booth, their wiretap was an unconstitutional search because they did not obtain a search warrant before placing it. =Harlan's concurrence= Justice John Marshall Harlan II, whose concurring opinion created the two-part \\"Katz test\\" that is regularly applied in Fourth Amendment cases Justice John Marshall Harlan II filed a concurring opinion in Katz that has become more well-known than the majority opinion because of its importance to American courts' attempts to interpret and apply the legal principles in the Katz decision. It describes a two-part test which has come to be known as the \\"Katz Test\\". Harlan began his opinion by noting that he concurred with the majority's judgment, but then explained that he was writing separately to elaborate on the meaning of Stewart's majority opinion. Harlan explained that he interpreted Stewart's statements that \\"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\\" and \\"what a person knowingly exposes to the public ... is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection\\" to mean that the Fourth Amendment protects any time a person has an expectation of privacy that is both subjective and objectively reasonable in the eyes of society at large. He summarized his view of the law as comprising a two-part test: The Supreme Court eventually adopted Harlan's two-part test as a formulation of the Fourth Amendment search analysis in the 1979 case Smith v. Maryland. =Black's dissent= Justice Hugo Black was the only dissenter in the decision. He argued that the Fourth Amendment was only meant to protect \\"things\\" from physical search and seizure, and was not meant to protect personal privacy. Additionally, Black argued that the modern act of wiretapping was analogous to the act of eavesdropping, which was around even when the Bill of Rights was drafted. Black concluded that if the drafters of the Fourth Amendment had meant for it to protect against eavesdropping they would have included the proper language. Effect and legacy The Supreme Court's decision in Katz significantly expanded the scope of the Fourth Amendment's protections, and represented an unprecedented shift in American search and seizure jurisprudence. Many law enforcement practices that previously were not \\"within the view\\" of the Fourth Amendmentsuch as wiretaps on public phone wiresare now covered by it and cannot be done without first obtaining a search warrant. However, Katz also created significantly more uncertainty surrounding the application of the Fourth Amendment. The Katz test of an objective \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\", which has been widely adopted by U.S. courts, has proven much more difficult to apply than the traditional analysis of whether a physical intrusion into \\"persons, houses, papers, and effects\\" occurred.

The Doha Development Round or Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is the trade-negotiation round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which commenced in November 2001 under then director- general Mike Moore. Its objective was to lower trade barriers around the world, and thus facilitate increased global trade. The Doha Round began with a ministerial-level meeting in Doha, Qatar in 2001. The aim was to put less developed countries' priorities at heart. The needs of the developing countries were the core reasons for the meeting. The major factors discussed include trade facilitation, services, rules of origin and dispute settlement. Special and differential treatment for the developing countries were also discussed as a major concern. Subsequent ministerial meetings took place in Canc√∫n, Mexico (2003), and Hong Kong (2005). Related negotiations took place in Paris, France (2005), Potsdam, Germany (2007), and Geneva, Switzerland (2004, 2006, 2008). Progress in negotiations stalled after the breakdown of the July 2008 negotiations. The most significant differences are between developed nations led by the European Union (EU), the United States (US), Canada, and Japan and the major developing countries led and represented mainly by India, Brazil, China, and South Africa. There is also considerable contention against and between the EU and the US over their maintenance of agricultural subsidies‚Äîseen to operate effectively as trade barriers. Since the breakdown of negotiations in 2008, there have been repeated attempts to revive the talks, so far without success. Intense negotiations, mostly between the US, China, and India, were held at the end of 2008 seeking agreement on negotiation modalities, an impasse which was not resolved. In April 2011, then director-general Pascal Lamy \\"asked members to think hard about 'the consequences of throwing away ten years of solid multilateral work'.\\"Documents from the negotiating chairs, 21 April 2011 at WTO official website A report to the WTO General Council by Lamy in May 2012 advocated \\"small steps, gradually moving forward the parts of the Doha Round which were mature, and re-thinking those where greater differences remained.\\"Report by the Chairman of the Trade Negotiations Committee News item at WTO official site, 2 May 2012 Adoption of the Bali Ministerial Declaration on 7 December 2013Bali Ministerial Declaration and decisions at WTO official website.

However, , the future of the Doha Round remains uncertain. Negotiations Doha Round talks are overseen by the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), whose chair is the WTO‚Äôs director-general, currently Roberto Azev√™do. The negotiations are being held in five working groups and in other existing bodies of the WTO. Selected topics under negotiation are discussed below in five groups: market access, development issues, WTO rules, trade facilitation and other issues. =Before Doha= Before the Doha ministerial, negotiations had already been under way on trade in agriculture and trade in services. These ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round, 1986‚Äì1994). However, some countries, including the United States, wanted to expand the agriculture and services talks to allow trade-offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization. The first WTO ministerial conference, which was held in Singapore in 1996, established permanent working groups on four issues: transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation (customs issues), trade and investment, and trade and competition. These became known as the Singapore issues. These issues were pushed at successive ministerials by the European Union, Japan and Korea, and opposed by most developing countries. Since no agreement was reached, the developed nations pushed that any new trade negotiations must include the mentioned issues. The negotiations were intended to start at the ministerial conference of 1999 in Seattle, and be called the Millennium Round but, due to several different events including protest activity outside the conference (the so-called \\"Battle of Seattle\\"), the negotiations were never started. Due to the failure of the Millennium Round, it was decided that negotiations would not start again until the next ministerial conference in 2001 in Doha, Qatar. Just months before the Doha ministerial, the United States had been attacked by terrorists on September 11th, 2001. Some government officials called for greater political cohesion and saw the trade negotiations as a means toward that end. Some officials thought that a new round of multilateral trade negotiations could help a world economy weakened by recession and terrorism- related uncertainty. According to the WTO, the year 2001 showed \\"...the lowest growth in output in more than two decades,\\" and world trade contracted that year. =Doha, 2001= The Doha round officially began in November 2001, committing all countries to negotiations opening agricultural and manufacturing markets, as well as trade-in-services (GATS) negotiations and expanded intellectual property regulation (TRIPS). The intent of the round, according to its proponents, was to make trade rules fairer for developing countries. However, by 2008, critics were charging that the round would expand a system of trade rules here were bad for development and interfered excessively with countries' domestic \\"policy space\\".E.g., \\"Statement By Civil Society Organisations on the WTO Negotiating Situation, and on Food And Financial Crises\\" Accra, 2008 The 2001 ministerial declaration established an official deadline for concluding negotiations for the Doha round at 1 January 2005. =Canc√∫n, 2003= The 2003 Canc√∫n talks‚Äîintended to forge concrete agreement on the Doha round objectives‚Äîcollapsed after four days during which the members could not agree on a framework to continue negotiations. Low key talks continued since the ministerial meeting in Doha but progress was almost non-existent. This meeting was intended to create a framework for further negotiations. The Canc√∫n ministerial collapsed for several reasons. First, differences over the Singapore issues seemed incapable of resolution. The EU had retreated on few of its demands, but several developing countries refused any consideration of these issues at all. Second, it was questioned whether some countries had come to Canc√∫n with a serious intention to negotiate. In the view of some observers, a few countries showed no flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about trade-offs. Third, the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was a major obstacle. The US‚ÄìEU agricultural proposal and that of the G20 developing nations, for example, show strikingly different approaches to special and differential treatment. Fourth, there was some criticism of procedure. Some claimed the agenda was too complicated. Also, Canc√∫n ministerial chairman, Mexico‚Äôs Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez, was faulted for ending the meeting when he did, instead of trying to move the talks into areas where some progress could have been made. The collapse seemed like a victory for the developing countries. The failure to advance the round resulted in a serious loss of momentum and brought into question whether 1 January 2005 deadline would be met. The North-South divide was most prominent on issues of agriculture. Developed countries' farm subsidies (both the EU‚Äôs Common Agricultural Policy and the US government agro-subsidies) became a major sticking point. The developing countries were seen as finally having the confidence to reject a deal that they viewed as unfavorable. This is reflected by the new trade bloc of developing and industrialized nations: the G20. Since its creation, the G20 has had fluctuating membership, but is spearheaded by the G4 (the People's Republic of China, India, Brazil, and South Africa). While the G20 presumes to negotiate on behalf of all of the developing world, many of the poorest nations continue to have little influence over the emerging WTO proposals. In dispute resolution mechanism of the WTO regime, the collapse of the Doha Round talks at Cancun in September 2003 has been attributed to Subsidies in agriculture and agricultural domestic support policies of developed nations =Geneva, 2004= The aftermath of Canc√∫n was one of standstill and stocktaking. Negotiations were suspended for the remainder of 2003. Starting in early 2004, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick pushed for the resumption of negotiations by offering a proposal that would focus on market access, including an elimination of agricultural export subsidies. He also said that the Singapore issues could progress by negotiating on trade facilitation, considering further action on government procurement, and possibly dropping investment and competition. This intervention was credited at the time with reviving interest in the negotiations, and negotiations resumed in March 2004. In the months leading up to the talks in Geneva, the EU accepted the elimination of agricultural export subsidies \\"by date certain\\". The Singapore issues were moved off the Doha agenda. Compromise was also achieved over the negotiation of the Singapore issues as the EU and others decided. Developing countries too played an active part in negotiations this year, first by India and Brazil negotiating directly with the developed countries (as the so-called \\"non-party of five\\") on agriculture, and second by working toward acceptance of trade facilitation as a subject for negotiation. With these issues pushed aside, the negotiators in Geneva were able to concentrate on moving forward with the Doha Round. After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what has become known as the Framework Agreement(sometimes called the July Package), which provides broad guidelines for completing the Doha round negotiations. The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A‚ÄìD) covering agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong. =Paris, 2005= Trade negotiators wanted to make tangible progress before the December 2005 WTO meeting in Hong Kong, and held a session of negotiations in Paris in May 2005. Paris talks were hanging over a few issues: France protested moves to cut subsidies to farmers, while the US, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India failed to agree on issues relating to chicken, beef and rice. Most of the sticking points were small technical issues, making trade negotiators fear that agreement on large politically risky issues will be substantially harder. =Hong Kong, 2005= Sixth WTO Ministerial Conferencerightthumb The Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference took place in Hong Kong, 13 to 18 December 2005. Although a flurry of negotiations took place in the fall of 2005, WTO director-general Pascal Lamy announced in November 2005 that a comprehensive agreement on modalities would not be forthcoming in Hong Kong, and that the talks would \\"take stock\\" of the negotiations and would try to reach agreements in negotiating sectors where convergence was reported. Trade ministers representing most of the world's governments reached a deal that sets a deadline for eliminating subsidies of agricultural exports by 2013. The final declaration from the talks, which resolved several issues that have stood in the way of a global trade agreement, also requires industrialized countries to open their markets to goods from the world's poorest nations, a goal of the United Nations for many years. The declaration gave fresh impetus for negotiators to try to finish a comprehensive set of global free trade rules by the end of 2006. Director-general Pascal Lamy said, \\"I now believe it is possible, which I did not a month ago.\\" The conference pushed back the expected completion of the round until the end of 2006. The round had been planned for conclusion in December 2005‚Äîafter two more ministerial conferences had produced a final draft declaration. The WTO pushed back its self-imposed deadline to slightly precede the expiration of the US President's Congressional Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority. Any declaration of the WTO must be ratified by the Congress to take effect in the United States. Trade Promotion Authority prevents Congress from amending the draft. It expired on 30 June 2007, and congressional leaders decided not to renew this authority for President George W Bush. =Geneva, 2006= The July 2006 talks in Geneva failed to reach an agreement about reducing farming subsidies and lowering import taxes, and negotiations took months to resume. A successful outcome of the Doha round became increasingly unlikely, because the broad trade authority granted under the Trade Act of 2002 to President George W. Bush was due to expire in 2007. Any trade pact would then have to be approved by the Congress with the possibility of amendments, which would hinder the US negotiators and decrease the willingness of other countries to participate. Hong Kong offered to mediate the collapsed trade liberalisation talks. Director-general of Trade and Industry, Raymond Young, says the territory, which hosted the last round of Doha negotiations, has a \\"moral high-ground\\" on free trade that allows it to play the role of \\"honest broker\\". =Potsdam, 2007= In June 2007, negotiations within the Doha round broke down at a conference in Potsdam, as a major impasse occurred between the US, the EU, India and Brazil. The main disagreement was over opening up agricultural and industrial markets in various countries and how to cut rich nation farm subsidies. =Geneva, 2008= On 21 July 2008, negotiations started again at the WTO's HQ in Geneva on the Doha round but stalled after nine days of negotiations over the refusal to compromise over the special safeguard mechanism. \\"Developing country members receive special and differential treatment with respect to other members' safeguard measures, in the form of a de minimis import volume exemption. As users of safeguards, developing country members receive special and differential treatment with respect to applying their own such measures, with regard to permitted duration of extensions, and with respect to re- application of measures.Technical Information on Safeguard Measures WTO official site Negotiations had continued since the last conference in June 2007. Director-general Pascal Lamy said before the start of the conference that the odds of success were over 50%. Around 40 ministers attended the negotiations, which were only expected to last five days but instead lasted nine days. Kamal Nath, India's Commerce Minister, was absent from the first few days of the conference due to a vote of confidence being conducted in India's Parliament. On the second day of the conference, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab announced that the US would cap its farm subsidies at $15 billion a year, from $18.2 billion in 2006. The proposal was on the condition that countries such as Brazil and India drop their objections to various aspects of the round. The US and the EU also offered an increase in the number of temporary work visas for professional workers. After one week of negotiations, many considered agreement to be 'within reach'. However, there were disagreements on issues including special protection for Chinese and Indian farmers and African and Caribbean banana imports to the EU. India and China's hard stance regarding tariffs and subsidies was severely criticized by the United States. In response, India's Commerce Minister said \\"I'm not risking the livelihood of millions of farmers.\\" The negotiations collapsed on 29 July over issues of agricultural trade between the United States, India, and China. In particular, there was insoluble disagreement between India and the United States over the special safeguard mechanism (SSM), a measure designed to protect poor farmers by allowing countries to impose a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall. Pascal Lamy said, \\"Members have simply not been able to bridge their differences.\\" He also said that out of a to-do list of 20 topics, 18 had seen positions converge but the gaps could not narrow on the 19th‚Äîthe special safeguard mechanism for developing countries. However, the United States, China and India could not agree on the threshold that would allow the mechanism to be used, with the United States arguing that the threshold had been set too low. The European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson characterized the collapse as a \\"collective failure\\".\\" Dismay at collapse of trade talks\\", BBC News, 30 July 2008 On a more optimistic note, India's Commerce Minister, Kamal Nath, said \\"I would only urge the director-general to treat this [failure of talks] as a pause, not a breakdown, to keep on the table what is there.\\" Several countries blamed each other for the breakdown of the negotiations.Voice of America News 30 July 2008 The United States and some European Union members blamed India for the failure of the talks.Times Online, London, 30 July 2008 India claimed that its position (i.e. that the US was sacrificing the world's poor for US/European commercial interests) was supported by over 100 countries.Guardian ‚Äì Doha: India accuses U.S. of sacrificing world's poor at trade talks Heather Stewart in Geneva, 31 July 2008 Brazil, one of the founding members of the G-20, broke away from the position held by India. Then-European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson said that India and China should not be blamed for the failure of the Doha round.NDTV Profit, India 30 July 2008 In his view, the agriculture talks had been harmed by the five-year program of agricultural subsidies recently passed by the U.S. Congress, which he said was \\"one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the U.S.\\". =Nairobi, 2015= On 19 December 2015, a WTO meeting in the Kenyan Capital led to an agreement for developed countries to end export subsidies immediately and developing countries to follow by the end of 2018. Attempts to restore In 2008, several countries called for negotiations to start again. Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, former president of Brazil, called several countries leaders to urge them to renew negotiations. The director-general and chair of the Trade Negotiations Committee Pascal Lamy visited India to discuss possible solutions to the impasse. A mini-ministerial meeting held in India on 3 and 4 September 2008 pledged to complete the round by the end of 2010.Liu Guoyuan Doha Round talks not optimistic despite positive signs at China View, 16 September 2009 The declaration at the end of the G20 summit of world leaders in London in 2009 included a pledge to complete the Doha round. Although a WTO ministerial conference scheduled in November 2009 would not be a negotiating session,WTO to hold 7th Ministerial Conference on 30 November-2 December 2009 WTO official website there would be several opportunities in 2009 to discuss the progress.FACTBOX: Meetings where WTO Doha round could be discussed Reuters, 26 May 2009 The WTO is involved in several events every year that provide opportunities to discuss and advance trade negotiations at a conceptual level. In early 2010, Brazil and Lamy focused on the role of the United States in overcoming the deadlock. President Lula urged Barack Obama to end a trade dispute between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies after the WTO gave Brazil the formal go-ahead in 2009 to impose sanctions on imports of over 100 US goods.Lula: Brazil urges US to respect WTO cotton ruling at Reuters, 10 March 2010 Lamy highlighted the difficulty of obtaining agreement from the US without the presidential fast- track authority and biennial elections. One of the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 is the desire of political leaders to shelter their constituents from the increasingly competitive market experienced during market contractions. Lamy hoped that the drop in trade of 12% in 2009, quoted as the largest annual drop since the Second World War, could be countered by successful conclusion of the Doha round. At the 2011 annual conference of the World Economic Forum in Davos, British prime minister David Cameron called for the Doha talks to conclude by the end of the year, saying that \\"We've been at this Doha round for far too long. It's frankly ridiculous that it has taken 10 years to do this deal.\\" Peter Sutherland, a former WTO director-general, called for the talks to be concluded in December that year. That hope having failed to eventuate, Pascal Lamy \\"reported to the General Council on 1 May 2012 that on the Doha Round, 'my conversations over the past few weeks with ministers and delegations have provided me with a sense that members wish to continue to explore any opportunities to gain the necessary traction and make tangible progress soon'.\\"Lamy: Members continue to explore opportunities for Doha progress News item at WTO official site, 2 May 2012 In December 2013, under new director-general Roberto Azev√™do, negotiations of the Ninth Ministerial Conference held in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia produced agreement on a \\"Bali Package\\", addressing a small portion of the Doha programme, principally bureaucratic \\"red tape\\".Agreement on Trade Facilitation: Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013 from official WTO website. Accessed 31 December 2013 Because of the controversial nature of reforming laws on intellectual property, trade in services and subsidising crops for Food Security, the talks focused on trade facilitation, which means lowering cross- border tariffs and other regulations which impede international trade. However, there was still some controversy over this, with Cuba threatening to oppose any deal which did not affect the US embargo on Cuba. The trade facilitation measures agreed in Bali could cut the cost of shipping goods around the world by more than 10%, by one estimate, raising global output by over $400 billion a year, with benefits flowing disproportionately to poorer countries. It was claimed that the Bali Package, if implemented in full, could boost the global economy by US$1 trillion and create 21 million new jobs. The Bali agreement included a 12-month deadline for the development of \\"a clearly defined work programme\\" on the remaining issues. The alternative to the WTO was seen as a proliferation of bilateral and regional agreements and, in the case of agriculture, the increased use of private standards. Issues Agriculture has become the lynchpin of the agenda for both developing and developed countries. Three other issues have been important. The first, now resolved, pertained to compulsory licensing of medicines and patent protection. A second deals with a review of provisions giving special and differential treatment to developing countries; a third addresses problems that developing countries are having in implementing current trade obligations. =Agriculture= Agriculture has become the most important and controversial issue. Agriculture is particularly important for developing countries, because around 75% of the population in developing countries live in rural areas, and the vast majority are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. \\"USAID ‚Äì Our work\\", 2010 The first proposal in Qatar, in 2001, called for the end agreement to commit to \\"substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.\\" The United States is being asked by the Indians (EU) and the developing countries, led by Brazil and India, to make a more generous offer for reducing trade-distorting domestic support for agriculture. The United States is insisting that the EU and the developing countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and to limit the number of import-sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts. Import-sensitive products are of most concern to developed countries like the European Union, while developing countries are concerned with special products ‚Äì those exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development, food security, or livelihood considerations.http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp- content/uploads/assets/crs/RS21905.pdf Brazil has emphasized reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, especially by the United States (some of which it successfully challenged in the WTO U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute), while India has insisted on a large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening. =Access to patented medicines= A major topic at the Doha ministerial regarded the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The issue involves the balance of interests between the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries that held patents on medicines and the public health needs in developing countries. Another issue concerns the protection of traditional medicinal knowledge and practices. Before the Doha meeting, the United States claimed that the current language in TRIPS was flexible enough to address public health emergencies, but other countries insisted on new language. On 30 August 2003, WTO members reached agreement on the TRIPS and medicines issue. Voting in the General Council, member governments approved a decision that offered an interim waiver under the TRIPS Agreement allowing a member country to export pharmaceutical products made under compulsory licenses to least- developed and certain other members. =Special and differential treatment= In the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the trade ministers reaffirmed special and differential (S&D;) treatment for developing countries and agreed that all S&D; treatment provisions \\"...be reviewed with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational.\\" The negotiations have been split along a developing-country/developed-country divide. Developing countries wanted to negotiate on changes to S&D; provisions, keep proposals together in the Committee on Trade and Development, and set shorter deadlines. Developed countries wanted to study S&D; provisions, send some proposals to negotiating groups, and leave deadlines open. Developing countries claimed that the developed countries were not negotiating in good faith, while developed countries argued that the developing countries were unreasonable in their proposals. At the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial, members agreed to five S&D; provisions for least developed countries (LDCs), including the duty-free and quota-free access. Research by the ODI sheds light on the priorities of the LDCs during the Doha round. It is argued that subsidies to agriculture, especially to cotton, unite developing countries in opposition more than SDT provisions and therefore have a greater consensus. Duty-free and quota-free access (DFQFA) currently discussed covers 97% of tariff lines and if the US alone were to implement the initiative, it would potentially increase Least Developed Countries' (LDCs) exports by 10% (or $1bn).Prowse, Susan 2009. Doha and the Global Crisis. Briefing Paper, 57. Overseas Development Institute. Many major trading powers already provide preferential access to LDCs through initiatives such as the Everything but Arms (EBA) initiative and the African Growth and Opportunity Act. =Implementation issues= Developing countries claim that they have had problems with the implementation of the agreements reached in the earlier Uruguay Round because of limited capacity or lack of technical assistance. They also claim that they have not realized certain benefits that they expected from the Round, such as increased access for their textiles and apparel in developed-country markets. They seek a clarification of language relating to their interests in existing agreements. Before the Doha ministerial, WTO members resolved a small number of these implementation issues. At the Doha meeting, the Ministerial Declaration directed a two-path approach for the large number of remaining issues: (a) where a specific negotiating mandate is provided, the relevant implementation issues will be addressed under that mandate; and (b) the other outstanding implementation issues will be addressed as a matter of priority by the relevant WTO bodies. Outstanding implementation issues are found in the area of market access, investment measures, safeguards, rules of origin, and subsidies and countervailing measures, among others. Benefits Most countries participating in the negotiations believe that there is some economic benefit in adopting the agreement; however, there is considerable disagreement of how much benefit the agreement would actually produce. A study by the University of Michigan found that if all trade barriers in agriculture, services, and manufactures were reduced by 33% as a result of the Doha Development Agenda, there would be an increase in global welfare of $574.0 billion. A 2008 study by World Bank Lead Economist Kym Anderson Kym Anderson found that global income could increase by more than $3000 billion per year, $2500 billion of which would go to the developing world.Kym Anderson and Bj√∏rn Lomborg, Free Trade, Free Labor, Free Growth, Project Syndicate May 2008 Others had been predicting more modest outcomes, e.g. world net welfare gains ranging from $84 billion to $287 billion by the year 2015. Pascal Lamy has conservatively estimated that the deal will bring an increase of $130 billion. Several think tanks and public organizations assess that the conclusion of the trade round will result in a net gain. However, the restructuring and adjustment costs required to prevent the collapse of local industries, particularly in developing countries, is a global concern. For example, a late 2009 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the United Nations Development Programme and the Kenyan Institute for Research and Policy Analysis found that Kenya would see gains in its exports of flowers, tea, coffee and oil seeds. It would concurrently lose in the tobacco and grains markets, as well as manufacturing of textiles and footwear, machinery and equipment.cited in IPS report Kenya faces grim prospects if Doha round succeeds at Corporate News in Business Daily, Nairobi, Kenya. 20 November 2009 The Copenhagen Consensus, which evaluates solutions for global problems regarding the cost-benefit ratio, in 2008 ranked the DDA as the second-best investment for global welfare, after the provision of vitamin supplements to the world's 140 million malnourished children.Copenhagen Consensus 2008 Press release: Copenhagen Consensus 2008 Results See also Safeguard * Subsidy * Trade bloc * Copenhagen Consensus * WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 * Anti-Globalization * Global administrative law * Globality References Further reading Anderson, Kym (ed.): Agricultural Trade Reform and the DOHA Development Agenda.

Plot summary The book tells the story of Ted Mundy, the Pakistan- born son of a British army officer, who as a student becomes proficient in the German language. He joins a 1960s-era student protest group in West Berlin and becomes a lifelong friend of a West German student anarchist named Sasha. Having been brutally beaten by West Berlin police and ejected from Germany, Mundy fails at several careers; as a teacher at an English prep school, as a newspaper reporter, a radio interviewer and a novelist. Eventually Mundy obtains a position with the British Council. Meanwhile, Sasha has defected to East Germany to become a member of the notorious Stasi secret police. On a trip to East Germany with a youth theatre group, Mundy and Sasha meet again. By this time Sasha has become totally disillusioned with the Communist Bloc and enlists the na√Øve Mundy to become a double agent. Sasha has access to state secrets and he recruits Mundy to help him smuggle them out of East Germany and deliver them to MI6, the British Secret Service. Their efforts contribute to the collapse of the GDR and eventual destruction of the Berlin Wall. Later, Sasha and Mundy once again conspire in grandiose schemes to combat American military and industrial globalization. The two ideologues become pawns of the group they thought they were combating. They are framed with planted explosives by American and German security services, who brutally shoot them during a staged raid. After they are killed, they are portrayed as terrorists \\"with connections to Al-Qaeda\\", in efforts to convince European governments to support the United States in its \\"war on terror\\". After Mundy's death, Amory, his controller from the British intelligence service during his espionage years, tries to publicize the truth, but slander by the British government results in his story being totally discredited.

A 7‚Ä≤2‚Ä≥ center, Burleson played for North Carolina State University's 1974 NCAA national championship team.  Early life  Burleson is a native of Avery County, North Carolina. He was an All-American at Newland High School and Avery County High School, as well as North Carolina State University.  College  As a collegian, Burleson teamed with All-American David Thompson, guard Monte Towe and forward Tim Stoddard (who would go on to have success as a Major League Baseball pitcher) to dethrone UCLA and win the 1974 NCAA Championship. Burleson was the MVP of the 1973 and 1974 ACC Tournaments and was All-Final Four in 1974. Burleson's defense of UCLA superstar Bill Walton was key to the Wolfpack's semifinal win. He was a member of the 1973 World University Games Gold Medal basketball team. When Burleson was recruited he was officially measured at tall, but the coaching staff at North Carolina State decided to list him at . Burleson wanted to be listed at his actual height but the coaching staff said he would officially be the tallest player in American basketball and it would bring a lot of good exposure to him and the school. The ploy worked and Burleson was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1974.  Olympic team  During the 1972 Olympics held in Munich, Burleson unwittingly walked into a parking lot where the Israeli hostages were brought before they were removed by helicopter from the Olympic village and later massacred. Burleson was held at gunpoint against a wall by one of the terrorists, and told not to move or look at the hostages as they came through the parking lot. He is the last athlete who had any contact with the Israeli Olympians 45 minutes before they died. Burleson was also a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team that lost a controversial gold medal game to the Soviet Union. The entire 1972 Olympic Basketball team believed they had been cheated and voted unanimously to not accept the silver.  Pro career  Before the 1974 NBA draft, it appeared almost certain that Burleson would be taken by the Phoenix Suns. But because Seattle traded Dick Snyder to the Cleveland Cavaliers at the last minute, the Sonics gained the right to pick before the Suns, so the two teams vied for a contract with Burleson. After considering both offers, Burleson chose Seattle. Drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics as the third overall player in the 1974 NBA Draft, Burleson entered the league tied with Artis Gilmore and Kareem Abdul- Jabbar as the tallest active NBA player at 7 feet 2 inches. Named to the 1974‚Äì75 NBA All-Rookie Team. Playing under coach Bill Russell, Burleson recorded strong playoff performances in both 1975 and 1976 for Seattle. For his playoff career, Burleson averaged 20.7 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game in 15 career playoff games. His second season as a professional proved to be his best, as he averaged 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game. Just as he began to come into his own in the NBA, he was injured breaking up a fight between his teammate and an opposing team member. The injury was instrumental in his steady decline over the next several years. Burleson was known throughout his amateur and pro career as a good shot blocker. He played seven seasons in the NBA with Seattle, the Kansas City Kings and the Atlanta Hawks.  Personal life  He lives in Avery County, North Carolina with his wife Denise. They have three sons: Robert, David, and Quentin. He is an avid supporter of North Carolina State University. He has served for several years a Special Ambassador to the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games.  Honors  In 2002, Burleson was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the fifty greatest players in Atlantic Coast Conference history.  Basketball camp  In 1983 Burleson founded the Tommy Burleson Basketball Camp, which is held in collaboration with the Avery County Parks and Recreation Department in North Carolina.

It is designed for quick and easy start up of development, while also using open-source Java technologies such as Spring Framework, Hibernate and Struts. AppFuse was originally created by Matt Raible, who wanted to eliminate the \\"ramp up\\" time in building new web applications. AppFuse provides a project skeleton, similar to the one that's created by an IDE when one clicks through a \\"new web project\\" wizard. AppFuse 1.x uses Ant to create the project, as well as build/test/deploy it, whereas AppFuse 2.x uses Maven 2 for these tasks. IDE support was improved in 2.0 by leveraging Maven plugins to generate IDE project files. AppFuse 1.x uses XDoclet and JDK 1.4+. Unlike other \\"new project\\" wizards, the AppFuse wizard creates a number of additional classes and files that implement features, but also serve as examples for the developer. The project is pre-configured to talk to a database, to deploy in an appserver, and to allow logging in. When AppFuse was first developed, it only supported Struts and Hibernate. In version 2.x, it supports Hibernate, iBATIS or JPA as persistence frameworks. For implementing the MVC model, AppFuse is compatible with JSF, Spring MVC, Struts 2 or Tapestry. Features integrated into AppFuse includes the following: * Authentication and Authorization * User Management * Remember Me (saving your login information so you don't have to log in every time) * Password Reminder * Signup/Registration * SSL Switching * E-Mail * URL rewriting * Skinnability * Page Decoration * Templated Layout * File Upload This out-of-the-box functionality is one of the main features in AppFuse that separates it from the other \\"CRUD Generation\\" frameworks, including Ruby on Rails and Grails. AppFuse is similar to Spring Roo in that both provide rapid productivity solutions for the Java programming language (whereas Grails and Ruby on Rails focus on other programming languages). The aforementioned frameworks, as well as AppFuse, allow you to create master/detail pages from database tables or existing model objects. AppFuse has also been included in JBuilder. The AppFuse project was shut down in April 2016. Its founder, Matt Raible, recommends using JHipster as an alternative.

History Founded in 1962 as the Canadian division of British Hawker Siddeley Group, the company assumed the assets of the A.V. Roe Canada Company Ltd.. Hawker Siddeley Canada focused on manufacturing heavy rail cars (hopper and tank cars) and transit vehicles (subway cars, intercity railcars and streetcars). Major clients included: * Toronto Transit Commission - H series (Toronto subway) (H1 to H5 only as H6 built by UTDC and H3 rebuilt H2 by TTC) cars * GO Transit - bi- level coaches Series I to II (Series III to IV were jointly built with UTDC) * Soo Line Railroad * Canadian Wheat Board - cylindrical grain hoppers * Saskatchewan Grain Car Corporation - grain hoppers * Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority - Orange and Blue line transit cars * National Railways of Mexico - passenger coaches Hawker Siddeley Canada headquarters was in Mississauga, Ontario. Its formation in 1962 saw the company acquire control of several A.V. Roe Canada subsidiaries including the Canadian Car and Foundry (CC&F;) as well as the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO) conglomerate, which included various steel mills, coal mines, manufacturing plants, and Halifax Shipyards. Consequently, Hawker Siddeley had two primary railcar manufacturing plants: * CC&F; factory in Thunder Bay, Ontario, for manufacturing railway transit cars, and *DOSCO factory in Trenton, Nova Scotia, for manufacturing railway freight cars (TrentonWorks), along with the Trenton Forge - the largest forge in North America. Hawker Siddeley forced its DOSCO subsidiary to close money-losing coal mines and steel mills, subsequently expropriated by the federal and Nova Scotia governments (see: Cape Breton Development Corporation and Sydney Steel Corporation). Likewise, CC&F; was forced to shed various assets. Halifax Shipyards was sold to Irving Shipbuilding Inc., a subsidiary of J.D. Irving Limited, in the 1990s. Hawker Siddeley Canada's operations were then acquired by Kingston-based UTDC (later sold to Bombardier Transportation of Montreal, Quebec). SNC-Lavalin purchased the railcar business but mothballed the TrentonWorks plant, which was later acquired by the Government of Nova Scotia and sold to Greenbrier. SNC-Lavalin sold the Thunder Bay plant to Bombardier Transportation and the Hawker Siddeley Canada name was ultimately dissolved in 2001.

Today the Thunder Bay plant is owned by Bombardier Transportation. The Trenton plant was sold in 1988 to Lavalin Industries and renamed TrentonWorks. The Greenbrier Companies acquired the plant in 1995 but during a serious contraction within the railcar sector in the mid 2000s closed the plant. The Thunder Bay plant primarily built passenger rail and transit equipment, while the Trenton plant built freight cars. * Covered Hopper Cars - for grain and other dry bulk commodities * Tank Cars - for liquids and compressed gases * Box Cars - for paper and general freight * Flat Cars - for lumber, steel, vehicles and large bulky freight * Gondolas - for steel, logs, stone, other bulk freight * Passenger cars  RT85 lightweight \\"Tempo\\" passenger cars (Coach Class T3, Club Coach Class T1 and Club Caf√© Class T2) for CN and NdeM.

According to the critic Bill Ectric, \\"much of Aylett‚Äôs work combines the bawdy, action-oriented style of Voltaire with the sedentary, faux cultivated style of Peacock.\\" Stylistically, Aylett is often seen as a difficult writer. As the critic Robert Kiely suggests, his books tend to be \\"baroque in their density, speed, and finely crafted detail; they are overcrowded, they dazzle and distort and wait for us to catch up with their narrative world.\\" Although Aylett is best known for his novels, and for his transmedial metafiction Lint, he has also created comics, stand-up, performance, music, movies, and art, often working in appropriative and other avant-garde modes. Aylett is also one of the few UK authors associated with the largely US-based Bizarro literary movement. Writing =Beerlight= Aylett's Beerlight series includes the novels The Crime Studio (1994), Slaughtermatic (1997), Atom (2000) and Novahead (2011), as well as shorter fiction such as 'The Siri Gun' (1998) and 'Shifa' (1999). The setting of these works has been described as a \\"cyber-noir vision of a near-future metropolis with a comic-book aesthetic\\" and as \\"a crime-ridden urban-noir hell inhabited by a menagerie of grotesque, amoral characters and surreal, mind-bending technology.\\" Stylistically, the Beerlight series \\"marries the cyberpunk vision of William Gibson‚Äôs Sprawl trilogy or Neal Stephenson‚Äôs Snow Crash, William S. Burroughs‚Äô talent for utterly weird but comprehensible description, and the hardboiled stylings of Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard.\\" =Accomplice= Only an Alligator (2001), The Velocity Gospel (2002), Dummyland (2002), and Karloff's Circus (2004) are set in Accomplice, a suburb on a tropical peninsula in a perhaps nuclear-blasted future, underneath which live demons; Aylett says he is in the tradition of \\"real satirists\\" such as Voltaire, Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain. The four books are collected in The Complete Accomplice (2010). =Jeff Lint= Lint (2005) is a satirical, Zelig-like biography of an imaginary author. The book traces Jeff Lint's career through thinly disguised satires on a number of well-known writers from the late 20th century, including Philip K. Dick, Hunter S. Thompson and Ken Kesey. As Paul Di Filippo remarks, Jeff Lint's work is sometimes not dissimilar to Aylett's. Jeff Lint is also a transmedial creation, incorporating a comic, The Caterer #3 (2008), purportedly written by Jeff Lint; a spoof Wikipedia page; a spoof collection of academic essays on Lint's work, And Your Point Is? (2014); and a mockumentary Lint: The Movie (2011), which features reminisces by \\"[Alan] Moore, Stewart Lee, Robin Ince, Mikey Georgeson, Josie Long, D. Harlan Wilson, Bill [Ectric], and many others on Lint‚Äôs outrageous and irritating career.\\" =Comic books= Aylett has also written for comics, most notably the Jeff Lint title The Caterer (2008). Other projects include #27 of Tom Strong (2004), The Promissory for Arthur magazine‚Äôs \\"mimeo\\" line (2007), Get That Thing Away From Me (2014), and Johnny Viable, which appeared in Alan Moore's print magazine Dodgem Logic and was collected and expanded as the standalone Johnny Viable & His Terse Friends (2014). Awards Slaughtermatic was shortlisted for the 1998 Philip K. Dick Award. Aylett was the recipient of the 2006 Jack Trevor Story Award.

Life and political career Alak was born to a family of Spanish, Italian and Armenian descent in Benito Ju√°rez, a pampas town in Buenos Aires Province. He worked as a journalist while studying law at the University of La Plata, and joined Chacho √Ålvarez and other center- left Peronists supporting Antonio Cafiero in the APU. Alak taught Public Law at the university and established a private practice. He married Marita Scarpino and had three children. Alak joined the Justicialist Party in 1984. Alak became the President of the La Plata branch of the party in 1988, and was nominated its mayoral candidate in 1991. He won the election, narrowly defeating the incumbent UCR mayor, and held the post until the 2007 election. =Tenure as mayor and stadium controversy= In the 1990s, Alak pushed through the construction of a new stadium for La Plata, over the objections of the two major football clubs, which chose to remain in their home fields. Concurrently, Alak sponsored a minor club, La Plata FC, which some claimed was part of an Alak patronage scheme. Significant sums were allegedly spent from the city budget for activities related to that club, which has virtually no following. For some time, it was thought that it would be the only side to play in the new stadium, which was used mainly for concerts. When a security regulation forbidding wooden stands came into effect in 2005, Estudiantes de La Plata relocated their home games to the Bosque (the field of rival side Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata), and later to the Quilmes stadium. The municipality has refused to allow Estudiantes an upgrade of their field, and ignored a court order that allowed its operation until a better solution was found. This behavior triggered animosity in the Estudiantes fan base. In 2006, Gimnasia's stadium was banned as well, and their management transferred their games to the new stadium, over fans' objections. In April 2006, Alak intervened against a judicial order that would have allowed the re-opening of both fields.Ol√©. In August 2006, an agreement has been reached to allow remodeling Estudiantes' field, using newer technologies, to allow for a 20,000 sitting room capacity. Critics argue that while millions went into the construction of the stadium, which the city did not need, thousands of poor people live in its shadows without receiving proper municipal services. When Estudiantes obtained the 2006 Apertura title, Alak invited the team to an official ceremony but the players declined to attend, claiming that the pressure from the crowd would not allow them to reach his office; actually, the players were at the Cathedral, 200 m (650 ft) from City Hall, and so the refusal to attend was perceived as a rebuke of Alak.La Naci√≥n Prior to the 2007 provincial election, Alak signed Estudiantes legend Juan Ram√≥n Ver√≥n to a post as children sports services coordinator. Estudiantes fans puzzled over the designation, which is perceived as cementing Alak's alignment with candidate Daniel Scioli and an attempt to heal the rift between Estudiantes and Alak's administration.El D√≠aEl D√≠a La Plata FC was dissolved only three months after Alak left office. =National government career= Initial results of the October 28, 2007, election indicated that Alak finished behind opposition candidate Pablo Bruera who took 25% to Alak's 20%.El D√≠a Sensing defeat, Alak's campaign operators attempted to suggest a link between Bruera and the killing of three policemen in La Plata, which took place nine days before the election; all investigations were inconclusive as of voting day, however (three suspects were detained and subsequently released). Alak was named to the Board of Directors of Aerol√≠neas Argentinas, on February 14, 2008, as the Argentine Government's representative on the air carrier's board,El D√≠a and served as its CEO following the air carrier's July 2008 nationalization. Following the ruling Front for Victory's defeat in the 2009 mid-term elections, Alak was tapped to replace Attorney General An√≠bal Fern√°ndez, who had been appointed the President's Cabinet Chief, effective July 8. Justice Minister Alak spearheaded more vigorous laws against terrorism, money laundering, and market manipulation during his tenure, as well as stepped up prosecutions of Dirty War perpetrators.

History The J.H. Filbert company, based in Baltimore, Maryland, developed the product in 1979 as a low-cost alternative to butter for the food service industry. The name originated from a comment by the husband of a company secretary as he sampled the product and it was first marketed to retail consumers in 1981. The company was acquired by Unilever in 1986, which then expanded sales of the product, previously only available primarily in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area, throughout the entire United States in 1988 and later to the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico in 1991.Wyman, Carolyn (2004). Better Than Homemade: Amazing Foods That Changed The Way We Eat. Quirk Books. pp.50-52. Jones, Geoffrey (2005). Renewing Unilever: Transformation and Tradition. Oxford University Press. pp. 102-03. The product was put on the market in Germany in 2011 and in Chile in 2012. Varieties In addition to a regular and 'light' spread, Unilever also uses the brand name to market a liquid butter substitute contained in a spray- bottle. This product is an emulsion of vegetable oil in water formulated with a 'hint' of butter flavor (derived from buttermilk) and is marketed as having zero calories and zero fat content. In 2017, Unilever announced two new varieties, \\"It's Vegan\\" and \\"It's Organic\\". Consumer sales =United States= It was reported in July 2005 (per research from the market research company Information Resources) that the product at that time led in product sales for its category of margarines, butter blends and spreads, with sales revenue standing at $244.7 million USD, summarized from 52 weeks up to July 10, 2005. But by 2012, the situation had changed. It was reported in 2012 by Euromonitor International that while sales of butter and spreadable oil fell, margarine sales increased by 1.1 percent, but sales of I Can‚Äôt Believe It‚Äôs Not Butter fell by 3.9 percent. 7 percent of sales at Unilever consists of spreads, with a significant amount consisting of butter substitutes, the sales of which are on the decline. In 2016, there were $248.4 million in sales of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and $47.7 million of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light. UK rebrand In February 2017, Unilever rebranded the product as \\"I Can't Believe It's So Good... For Everything!\\" in the UK. The stated objective was to increase awareness of the product's versatility. The rebrand was greeted with puzzlement and some derision by many media commentators. Subsequently, the branding was simplified to \\"I Can't Believe It's So Good...\\". The brand was returned to its original form in November 2019.

He is currently a lawyer in private practice. Life and career Rufus L. Edmisten was born and raised in Boone, North Carolina. He earned an undergraduate degree in political science with honors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a J.D. from the George Washington University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where he served on the Law Review. During law school, he joined the Capitol Hill staff of North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, where he served as the Counsel to Senator Ervin's Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights and as Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Subcommittee on Separation of Powers. In 1973-1974, Edmisten was the Deputy Chief Counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, which Ervin chaired. With Terry Lenzner, an assistant counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee, Edmisten served the subpoena to the White House for the Watergate tapes. It was the first time in history that a Congressional Committee served a subpoena on a sitting president. During his time working for Senator Ervin, Edmisten participated in important legislative initiatives, such as securing constitutional rights for American Indians and providing constitutional protections for military personnel. Following Senator Ervin's retirement in 1974, Edmisten returned to North Carolina. He was elected state attorney general in 1974 and served in that post for ten years. While attorney general, Edmisten engaged in a successful effort to prevent the damming of the scenic New River. He launched a variety of legislative efforts, such as securing victim's rights, enhancing the state's historic preservation laws, and setting new educational standards for the state's law enforcement personnel. Edmisten was the Democratic nominee for governor in 1984, losing to Republican James G. Martin, a loss attributed to Martin's endorsements by Edmisten's Democratic primary rivals. After his unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, Edmisten practiced law with Reagan H. Weaver for four years. In the 1988 and 1992 elections, Edmisten won the office of Secretary of State. As Secretary of State he broadened securities oversight in an effort to protect investors, and worked with the General Assembly to craft a law to establish Limited Liability Corporations in North Carolina. In 1996 Edmisten resigned from office after an audit of the Secretary of State's office led to a State Bureau of Investigations inquiry into several alleged abuses of office. The investigation, which involved more than 100 interviews and culminated in a 3000-page report, exonerated Edmisten and his staff from all the accusations. Edmisten maintained that his resignation had nothing to do with the investigation. After his resignation in 1996 Edmisten launched a legal practice that merged with that of former NC Department of Justice colleague and Deputy US attorney, Woody Webb, in 1998. Edmisten has filled key roles in several private organizations outside of his legal practice. He runs a charity in North Carolina called the Foundation for Good Business: Extra Special Super Kids. The Super Kids program provides college scholarships to underprivileged high school students who wish to pursue higher learning. Rufus has served on the N.C. Capitol Foundation for over 25 years, including a six-year stint (2000‚Äì2006) as president of the foundation. He is a member of the boards of directors of the Julia Crump Foundation and Project Enlightenment, both of which are charitable organizations that seek to enhance educational opportunities for disadvantaged youths. Rufus also served as a board member for the Raleigh region of Union Bank. Thirty years ago, Rufus, famous Jim Valvano, and Don Shea founded the Jim Valvano Kids Klassic Golf Tournament, which has raised several million dollars to seek a cure for children suffering from cancer at Duke University Hospital. Rufus and his wife, Linda, live in a designated 1921 National Register and Raleigh Historic Landmark house. He is a panelist on NC Spin, North Carolina's longest running political talk show, and he is a frequent guest on the Weekend Gardener, a 40-year-old popular garden show on WPTF Radio. Edmisten is an avid gardener. Jasper, a six-year-old, feisty English Setter, is Rufus's best buddy and the protector of the 2 1/2 acre home place.

Career Pollock worked as a teacher in the late 1970s eventually becoming director of sport at the College Beausoleil in Villars, Switzerland. Here he met a young Jacques Villeneuve who had been sent to the school following the death of his Formula One driver father Gilles. After leaving school Villeneuve pursued a career as a racing driver, following in his father's footsteps. Villeneuve entered Formula 3 with Prema Racing in Italy and had relatively poor results. The two men were brought back together by a chance meeting at the Suzuka circuit. Villeneuve was invited by a Japanese Photographer and fan of his late father to attend an event during the GP weekend. Pollock was attending on Honda related business. The meeting at the circuit led to 3 meetings in Switzerland when Villeneuve was pursuing the possibility of Pollock managing his career. Pollock accepted after the last meeting. Pollock's first initiative was to negotiate with Toyota Team Tom's in Japan and move Villenuve to Tokyo where he could have the chance to work on his pure talent as a driver. (1992). During this year Pollock was contacted by Jean-Claude Torchia working for Imperial Tobacco in Montreal to see if Villeneuve would accept driving in the Formula Atlantic are at Trois Riviers in Quebec. This opened the door for Pollock to commence future negotiations for Villeneuve's future career in the States. A 3 year deal was signed. In 1993 Villeneuve raced in American Formula Atlantic before breaking into IndyCars in 1994. After winning a Road America (Elkhart lake) in his rookie season Villeneuve won the Indy car championship and prestigious Indianapolis 500 win in 1995. Pollock used this winning streak to negotiate Villeneuve's entry into F1 with the Williams F1 team where he won the championship in his second year (1997). During Villeneuve's final year in Indy Car Pollock had been working in the background to set up a new Formula One Team when he had been told by Reynard (Adrian Reynard) if he could get the funding, the Engine supply partner and the driver, he could count on Reynard to help. Imperial Tobacco was taken over by BAT (British American Tobacco) and the door was open for pollock ago use his contacts from the Indy Car success. Pollock convinced BAT to invest in the project using his old contacts then working for BAT in the UK. In 1998 Pollock purchased Tyrrell with his partners at the same time he was building BAR (British American Racing) from a Greenfield site, Pollock signed his close friend and driver to be team leader. Immediately a controversial figure, Pollock made numerous claims about how successful his team would be. These claim's were in reality made during the huge announcement event by his partner and technical director of the team Adrian Reynard when he announced in front of all the journalists (in a London based event) that \\"Reynard\\" had always obtained \\"pole position\\" in their first race then \\"won\\" the Championship in their second season. BAR was last in the championship in their first year. Pollock spent the time working with the team to improve and was successful in his endeavour to sign Honda to return to F1 with his team. He was successful and Honda returned with BAR to become BAR Honda in 2000. BAR Honda finished 5th in the Championship (4th equal in points with Benneton). Pollock managed Villeneuve through the end of his Formula career. Further to Pollock leaving BAR he was contacted by Kevin Kalkhoven to enter Formula One and carried out a due diligence of the bankrupt Arrows Team but decided against it. Kalkhoven suggested that they enter the CART series and Pollock negotiated the purchase of the assets of PacWest Cart team and entered the CART championship for the 2003 series. Pollock managed this only for one season and requested that Kalkhoven purchase his shares to manage this team himself. During this period Pollock introduced Kalkhoven to an ex business partner Gerald Forsythe. From this introduction both Kalkhoven and Forsythe bought the series and Cosworth. Pollock and Villeneuve ended their business relationship in January 2008. \\"Jacques Villeneuve parts ways with longtime manager Craig Pollock\\" =PURE= In May 2011, Pollock announced his creation of Propulsion Universelle et Recuperation d'Energie (PURE), an engineering company which was set up to design and supply Power Units to F1 as an independent supplier. Pollock became to sole investor in PURE SA and ran out of funds in 2014. PURE SA was liquidated the same year. In July 2012, technical director Gilles Simon announced his departure from PURE in a general email sent out to suppliers and colleagues due to the financial difficulties the company was having. Since Gilles Simon's departure PURE's financial trouble has been well publicised throughout the globe.http://www.eurosport.fr/formule-1/saison-2014/2014/le-developpement-du- moteur_sto3364222/story.shtml References 1956 births Living people People from Falkirk Formula One people Scottish motorsport people Formula One team owners British sports agents ","title":"Craig Pollock"},{"id":"1845516","text":"Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) is a North American music publishing company and is part of the Universal Music Group, a subsidiary of Vivendi and Tencent.

The 65th book by Naylor, it is the first in a quartet about a young boy and the title character, an abused dog. Naylor decided to write Shiloh after an emotionally taxing experience in West Virginia where she encountered an abused dog. Narrator and protagonist Marty Preston lives in the hills of Friendly, West Virginia. After finding an abused beagle owned by his brutal neighbor Judd Travers, Marty defies his society's standards of not meddling with each other's business. Marty resolves to steal and hide the dog, naming him Shiloh and fabricating a web of lies to keep his secret. After his theft is discovered, Marty discovers Judd shooting a deer out of season and blackmails him into selling Shiloh to him. Because he lacks the money to buy Shiloh, Marty resolutely works for Judd doing numerous chores. Primarily a Bildungsroman and adventure novel, the novel depicts the emotional tribulations and maturing of an 11-year-old boy. Some themes of the novel are ethics, consequentialism, religion and morality, and animal‚Äìhuman relationships. Marty learns that morality is confounding and must choose between two unpalatable choices: rescuing the abused Shiloh through stealing and lying or allowing Judd to keep abusing Shiloh. Reviewers generally gave positive reviews of the book and were impressed by the novel's suspense and vernacular language. In addition to the Newbery Medal, Shiloh has received several state awards voted upon by children, including the Sequoyah Children's Book Award, the Mark Twain Readers Award, and the William Allen White Children's Book Award. In 1996, the book was adapted into a movie of the same name. The novel spawned three sequels, Shiloh Season, Saving Shiloh, and A Shiloh Christmas published in 1996, 1997, and 2015, respectively. Shiloh is taught in many elementary school courses in the United States. Background and publishing Phyllis Reynolds Naylor in her writing chair, where she writes the first two drafts of every book by hand Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor was raised in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her childhood she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed a major part of her early years‚Äî\\"the happiest part\\". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren. Naylor writes books for children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor typically takes several years to finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and character traits when she thinks of them. She considered Shiloh to be a deviation from the norm because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks. Edited by Jonathan Lanman, Shiloh was published by Atheneum Books on September 30, 1991. The novel has been translated into at least 10 languages: Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Swedish. Plot summary The novel is set in the small town of Shiloh, West Virginia, where an eleven-year-old boy named Marty Preston finds a stray beagle named Shiloh wandering in the hills near his house. Shiloh follows him home. The dog's name is a tribute to a neighborhood schoolhouse. Shiloh's real owner is Judd Travers, who owns several hunting dogs. Fearing for the dog's safety because Judd drinks and treats his hunting dogs poorly, Marty does not want to return Shiloh. His father insists that Shiloh be returned to his rightful owner and they take the dog home to Judd. Shiloh returns to Marty who hides him from his family. Concealing Shiloh in the woods in a wire pen he builds, Marty smuggles some of his dinner to the dog each evening. After his mother discovers Marty feeding the dog, he persuades her not to reveal the secret. That night, Shiloh is attacked by a German Shepherd Dog while in his makeshift cage and his family discovers Marty has been lying and hiding the dog. After taking the dog to the town doctor, the family must return Shiloh to his rightful owner by Sunday. Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' house to try to convince Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At the end of the first week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, repents, and lets him keep Shiloh. Autobiographical elements Clover, the mistreated beagle in West Virginia who inspired Naylor to write Shiloh In a 1992 interview about Shiloh, Naylor said: \\"Like a patchwork quilt, a novel is made up of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings.\\" Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was \\"the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen\\", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night. Rex asked her if she would have a \\"nervous breakdown\\" or if she would \\"do something about it\\". That \\"something\\" referred to writing a book, which she did. She believed that someone had abused the dog and was confronted by a series of questions: The Maddens resided near Shiloh, West Virginia, where Naylor found the abused dog in 1989, so she decided to name the book's dog Shiloh. Because the Maddens' post office address is in Friendly, West Virginia, Naylor chose the town as her book's setting. Trudy and Frank Madden adopted the abused dog Naylor had seen. Trudy Madden said in a 1997 interview that Naylor's description of Shiloh, West Virginia, was precise. By following the directions in Shiloh and its sequels, the town's houses, mill, and schoolhouse could be located easily. Style Shiloh is told in the first person in main character Marty Preston's voice. The prose has perceptible grammatical errors and a bucolic tone. Arlene Perly Rae of Toronto Star wrote that the novel is written in the \\"uncomplicated style\\" for which Naylor is distinguished. Jane Langton of The New York Times Book Review stated that the novel was written in a \\"comfortable, down-home style\\". Writing that the main story in Shiloh is Marty's struggle in his mind with morality, Langston noted that it is \\"presented simply, in a way any third- or fourth-grade reader can understand\\". Scholar Kathie Cerra praised the novel for its \\"vivid sensory detail\\", which enables readers to experience Marty's \\"inner life of thought and feeling\\". In Marty's \\"teem[ing] with life\\" first-person narrative, he shows how he feels when he tells lies to his parents and when he embraces the wriggling Shiloh. Academic Leona W. Fisher wrote in Children's Literature Association Quarterly that the novel employs a seldom used yet ingenious literary technique: the story is told with \\"the sustained internal monologue presented almost exclusively in the present tense\\". The mores of his society and the actions of adults are strained through Marty's mind concurrently with his emotional agony and ethical judgments. The dialogue of the other characters tempers but does not counteract the \\"exclusivity of his linguistic point of view\\" because Marty is the sole narrator. Shiloh has a \\"compacted time-frame, bounded by the past-tense opening and closing\\". Fisher noted that because the novel's events are confined to several weeks in the summer, there is no need for a \\"panoramic sweep\\" of the actions. The reader can concentrate solely on Marty's ethical crisis. Conveying the mood of the novel is also mostly confined to Marty's thoughts and current action. Naylor uses the past- perfect verb \\"had\\" on several occasions to depict the tones of the scenes. This usage conveys turning-points in the story, transferring the reader from the \\"immediate tension\\" of the present to a growing cognizance. Scholars Alethea Helbig and Agnes Perkins wrote that the \\"Appalachian setting is well evoked, in both its beauty and its code of ethics that Marty must defy to save the dog\\". Reviewer Ellen Mandel of Booklist wrote that the \\"West Virginia dialect richly seasons the true-to-life dialogue\\". Kenneth E. Kowen of School Library Journal perceived an incongruity in Naylor's depiction of Marty's family. He noted that Marty's father is a postman, one of the best paid jobs in suburban settings. In the novel, however, the family is poverty-stricken. Reviewer Cecilia Goodnow noted that Shiloh is a Bildungsroman and adventure novel. Marty undergoes a physical and emotional transformation in his quest to save Shiloh. After confronting an abusive adult, he mentally grows, concluding: \\"I saved Shiloh and opened my eyes some. Now that ain't bad for eleven.\\" Salem Press's Carol Ann Gearhart has characterized the novel as domestic realism. Themes =Abuse and love= Physically abused as a child, Judd wants to keep Shiloh because he does not comprehend why people are so interested in rescuing the abused dog. No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him. =Animal‚Äìhuman relationships= Author Timothy Morris wrote that the plot and themes in Shiloh had many parallels to the 1940 novel Lassie Come-Home by Eric Knight. In both novels, boys fall in love with dogs owned by others. The dogs repeatedly return to the children in \\"mirror imag[e] scenes\\", while the ethical fathers try to convince them not to betray their morals and fall for the dogs. Morris wrote that Shiloh's faithfulness to Marty is portrayed in \\"affective human terms\\". In the secluded, bucolic West Virginia, Shiloh becomes the masculine friend Marty did not have. The beagle adopts the persona of the brother Marty never had. Marty doggedly believes that Shiloh and other animals are creatures with feelings. Attune with Marty's emotions, the beagle is considered by Marty to be a confidante. On the other hand, in pastoral West Virginia, some adults consider animals to bring only economic benefits to humans. Morris stated that children like Marty defy their rural culture and advance to an upper-class mindset. Scholar Claudia Mills wrote that Marty's parents subscribe to the belief that because Shiloh is Judd's property, they should not be concerned with how Judd treats Shiloh. They tell Marty: \\"You've got to go by the law. The law says that a man that pays money for a dog owns that dog.\\" At odds with this philosophy, Marty strongly believes that love‚Äînot money‚Äîshould determine ownership. =Ethics= In Shiloh, Naylor does not impart an explicit meaning of \\"honesty\\" to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how \\"confusing and unanswerable\\" morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions serve as a contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, \\"Jesus ... which do you want me to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so that one of your creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?\\" According to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, Naylor makes the statement that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: Naylor believes that there is much \\"gray area between right and wrong\\". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times- Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that \\"nothing is as simple as it seems\\". Entertainment Weekly Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that Shiloh is a \\"strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life\\". In the children's literature journal The ALAN Review published by The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents, Edgar H. Thompson, Connie B. Blevins, and Allison Fitzgerald argued that protagonist Marty \\"consistently behaves\\" at levels 5 and 6 of Kohlberg's stages of development. For instance, on his walk to Judd's house, he wonders: \\"Easy as pie for Judd Travers to put a bullet hole in my head, say he didn't see me.\\" Despite his fears, Marty continues walking to Judd's house, persistent on protecting Shiloh despite potential bodily harm and even death to himself. The authors brooded over whether an 11 year old could attain such an elevated level despite most adults' never being able to do so. Ultimately noting that the Newbery Committee and thousands of readers consider Marty to be realistic, they concluded that Marty is a positive role model for children to strive to be. =Consequentialism= In her essay \\"The Structure of the Moral Dilemma in Shiloh\\" for Children's Literature, Claudia Mills wrote that Shiloh deals with \\"consequentialism pitted against deontological respect for moral duty\\". Taught from his youth to be respectful to others and worship God, Marty is confounded by the injustice of Shiloh's being abused. He seeks to justify his unethical actions by thinking that \\"[a] lie don't seem a lie anymore when it's meant to save a dog.\\" Consequentionalists base the worthiness of a person's act on its result. Marty's act of saving Shiloh is worse for Shiloh's well-being. After Shiloh is concealed in the woods, a German shepherd attacks the beagle, causing to become permanently lame. Marty laments: \\"Worst of all, I'd brought Shiloh here to keep him from being hurt, and what that German shepherd done to him was probably worse than anything Judd Travers would have brought himself to do, short of shootin' him, anyways.\\" Mills noted that consequentialism does not merely expect that the consequences to one entity is determined. It requires a review of the consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: \\"By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill this one out of season, he'll figure maybe he can kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer\\". In essence, he selects the \\"domestic love over the grander principle\\". =Religion and morality= Reviewers observed that religion plays an influential role in Marty's moral decisions. After Marty takes a forbidden bite from his sister Dara Lynn's chocolate Easter rabbit and refuses to own up, his mother is disappointed. She tells him: \\"Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't know who did it, but Jesus knows. And right this minute Jesus is looking down with the saddest eyes on the person who ate that chocolate.\\" Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be \\"separated forever from God's love.\\" Academic Claudia Mills wrote that Marty determines to save Shiloh in a scene that is reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn's well-known resolution to save Jim from slavery: \\"All right, then, I'll go to hell.\\" Thinking about the falsehoods he has told to save Shiloh, he believes he is bound for hell. He reflects: Near the novel's conclusion, Judd refuses to honor his agreement with Marty because there was no witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: \\"Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it.\\" Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: \\"I got no choice. All I can do is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do.\\" After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: \\"What you going to do with that dog once he's yours?\\" Marty's simple reply is: \\"Love him.\\" Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: \\"The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh.\\" Reception The News & Observers Elizabeth Ward listed Shiloh as one of the best children's books in 1991. She called the book a \\"heartstopping, but tough-as-steel story of a boy and an abused dog in the hardscrabble hill country of West Virginia\\". Author Timothy Morris deemed Shiloh to be the \\"most celebrated dog novel of the nineties\\". Michele Landsberg of Entertainment Weekly called Shiloh a \\"compelling read\\" and rated the novel an A. Equating Shiloh to classics like Charlotte's Web, author Laura Elliott praised the novel's \\"voice, suspense, and layer of themes\\". After Shiloh received the Newbery Award, Jane Langton wrote in The New York Times Book Review: \\"Did Shiloh really deserve the prize? Surely there must have been a book more important than this agreeable but slight story.\\" Langton opined that Shiloh was \\"a good book, not a great book\\" and that there must have been few worthy children's books that year. The Sacramento Bees Judy Green disagreed, believing that Shiloh was \\"worthy of its award, which labels it the best fiction for children written last year\\". Green lauded Naylor for her \\"excellent portrayal of Marty's introspection and superb storytelling in the area's vernacular\\". The Booklists Ellen Mandel extolled the novel for its \\"moving and powerful look\\" at the virtues and vices of human nature and the murky moral choices in conflicts of everyday life. In her favorable review of Shiloh, Betsy Hearne of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books wrote that \\"readers will be absorbed by the suspenseful plot, which will leave them with some memorable characterizations as well as several intriguing ethical questions\\". K.B. Cartwright of The Reading Teacher also praised the novel for providing a \\"gripping account of family conflict and honesty\\". In a similarly positive review, Kirkus Reviews praised the book for being a \\"gripping account of a mountain boy's love for a dog he's hiding from its owner\\". Calling it \\"unusually warm and moving\\", Heather Vogel Frederick of The Christian Science Monitor praised the novel for being an \\"excellent choice as a family read- aloud\\". Censors have objected to the profanity in Shiloh. Naylor received an angry letter from the parents of a 10-year-old boy, who were angered by the language in the book. The character Judd had sworn, \\"dammit\\". The author replied in an interview with The Virginian-Pilot that some people in the world \\"speak crudely\\" and \\"you can't put your child in a glass bubble and protect him always\\". Several West Virginian book reviewers have complained about the dialect in the novel, believing that West Virginians do not speak with a dialect. In one review, a newspaper writer said that when she read the book to her children, she chose not to read with the dialect. Honors In 1992, Shiloh received the John Newbery Medal. The annual award, bestowed by the children's librarians division of the American Library Association, is given for \\"the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". Shiloh was a dark horse for the award. Ohio State University Professor Rudine Sims Bishop, a member of the 1992 Newbery committee, said in an interview that Shiloh was a \\"sleeper\\" that surfaced as a serious contender deep in their debate. After the January 27, 1992 announcement of Shilohs winning the Newbery Medal, Naylor was flooded with numerous phone calls, requests for interviews, and mail. In an April 1992 interview, Naylor said: \\"Frankly, to go the bathroom, I have had to take the phone off the hook.\\" The book was also selected as an American Library Association Notable Children's Book. In January 1994, over 60,000 third‚Äìsixth graders in the state of Oklahoma selected from Shiloh 23 nominees as the winner of the Sequoyah Children's Book Award. The Sequoyah Award was presented to Naylor in April 1994 during the yearly Oklahoma Library Association conference. On April 14, 1994, at the annual conference of the Missouri Association of School Librarians, Shiloh received that year's Mark Twain Readers Award. The Mark Twain Award is decided annually through a vote by fourth‚Äìeighth graders in the state of Missouri. On October 29, 1994, Naylor received the William Allen White Children's Book Award for Shiloh. The award is decided through the tallying of over 55,000 children in the state of Kansas. In 1997, The Virginian-Pilot chose Shiloh as the subject of a \\"community-wide effort to get people of all ages reading and talking about books\\". Beginning in October, the newspaper serialized Shiloh, publishing two chapters every week until the end of November. It also created a book guide about Shiloh and printed 1,000 copies for parents and teachers. A chat room was created for children to direct questions and comments about Shiloh. In 1999, Shiloh was selected as a recommended novel for children ages nine to twelve in the Read Across America initiative. In 2000, the Shiloh trilogy placed at number seven on the National Education Association's Children's Top 100 book list. Naylor was delighted that children had given her work such a high ranking. Shiloh is taught in many American elementary school courses. Sequels Shiloh has three sequels, Shiloh Season, Saving Shiloh, and A Shiloh Christmas published in 1996, 1997, and 2015 respectively. In Shiloh Season, Naylor renews the strife by restoring Judd's hostility and aggravating it with a bout of drinking issues. Marty fears Judd will take back Shiloh and be faithless to the deal they made. Whereas in Shiloh Marty confronts the confusing and ambiguous concept of morality, in Shiloh Season he must face the notion of wickedness. In the third book, Saving Shiloh, Marty's parents persuade Marty that people who have wronged are worthy of forgiveness. In the midst of several robberies and a murder, the community hastily faults Judd. Willing to grant Judd a second chance, Marty attempts to help him. Meanwhile, Marty and his family must face the intricacies of life such as death, hostility, and sibling rivalry. Published on September 22, 2015, the fourth book, A Shiloh Christmas, was published by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents to determine whether the disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together. Naylor penned the sequels in response to \\"the surprising degree of hatred which children show toward Judd Travers\\". Noting that Judd's life had been molded by the abuse he suffered as a child, she hoped that the novels would enable children to see Judd as a person like Marty who must make difficult moral choices. The first three books in the quartet each were made into a movie: Shiloh in 1996, Shiloh Season in 1999, and Saving Shiloh in 2006. Adaptations =Film= In 1996 Warner Bros. Pictures released Shiloh, which was directed by Dale Rosenbloom. The first of Naylor's more than 100 juvenile and adult works to be adapted into a movie, it starred Blake Heron as Marty and Scott Wilson as Judd Travers. Budgeted at less than $2 million, Shiloh was filmed in 30 days in October 1996 at Topanga, California. Rosenbloom's film differed from Naylor's novel in several key aspects. In the novel, Marty's family is poor and economic opportunities are limited. The family's four-room homestead is ancient and has not seen remodeling in decades. In the film, the family is wealthy and there are numerous economic opportunities. The family's two-story house is a \\"stunning showplace of hardwoods, elegant color schemes, and tasteful appointments\\". Marty makes money very quickly by doing various chores. By transforming Marty's family from being poor to being well off, Rosenbloom makes the conflict between Marty and Judd an emotional, instead of an economic one. In the novel, Marty and his family hunt animals, while in the film, his father does not hunt. Author Timothy Morris states that \\"[t]he force of the film's ideology is to blur all distinctions between humans and animals\\". Judd is transformed from a native in the novel into an interloper in the film who holds the contrarian view that humans and animals are different, that \\"[a]nimals were put here for us. They ain' got no other purpose or feelin's.\\" Instead of being about Marty's love for Shiloh, most of the novel occurs in Marty's thoughts such as when he ponders about telling falsehoods to his parents. Because the book was considered \\"very internal\\" by the major film studios, director Dale Rosenbloom labored over making the film more external. Rosenbloom added new characters and scenes to the story and faxed each change to the novel's author. Naylor was neither fearful of Rosenbloom's changes nor unhesitant at suggesting changes. After the film was released, Naylor said that Rosenbloom \\"did a very good job\\", and Rosenbloom said, \\"We did do right by the book and her ... She lives by her code and if you honor it, she appreciates it.\\" By June 1997, Naylor had seen the film six times. In an interview that month, she noted that she was always struck by the hush of the theater and by how the film entrances everyone, even the children. Despite an underwhelming performance in the movie theaters, the film received high video sales. Ranking Shiloh as one of his top 10 selections, Roger Ebert praised the film for being a \\"remarkably mature and complex story about a boy who loves a dog and cannot bear to see it mistreated\\", depicting \\"the real world with all of its terrors and responsibilities\\". Shiloh was honored with \\"best film\\" at the Chicago International Film Festival. =Audiobook= The audiobook version of Shiloh was released by Bantam Books in 1992. Performed by Peter MacNicol, the three- hour-long audiobook is unabridged. Author John Wynne praised MacNicol's delivery, writing that he \\"does character voices well‚Äîboth male and female‚Äîand creates a folksy atmosphere appropriate to the material\\".

The marriage ended when the children were young, and he left Ohio, having no further contact with Rosa or the children. Huhta worked briefly as a reporter for the daily News-Tribune in Duluth, Minnesota but resigned after an editor \\"misquoted him and balled up his article\\" about an Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) mass meeting. According to one account, this was when he joined the IWW or \\"Wobblies\\", as they are sometimes called. Huhta contributed numerous articles and songs to IWW publications over a period of twenty years and was widely regarded as one of the union's finest writers. He was a regular columnist for Industrial Solidarity and later wrote for the Industrial Worker and Industrialisti. In addition to his writing, Huhta supported himself in various ways. His experience working on docks and barges around the country had by the mid-1930s garnered him a position as barge captain in New York City. On May 15, 1942 Huhta's body was found floating in the Hudson River, where it appeared to have been for several days. The death was ruled an accidental drowning although the exact circumstances were unclear. There was no funeral, and in the end Huhta was buried in a potter's field on Hart Island.

This species has some claim to being the world's largest flower, for although the average size of R. arnoldi is greater than the average R. kerrii, there have been two recent specimens of exceptional size: One specimen found in the Lojing Highlands of peninsular Malaysia on April 7, 2004 by Prof. Mat-Salleh and Mat Ros measured in width,\\"Rafflesia in Bloom\\" at http://rafflesia-in-bloom.blogspot.com/ while another found in August 2007 in Kelantan State, peninsular Malaysia by Dr. Gan Canglin measured .http://rafflesiaspp.blogspot.com/2008/03/r-kerrii-world- biggest-rafflesia-found.html\\"World's Biggest Rafflesia Found in Kelantan\\" at http://e.sinchow-i.com/content.phtml?sec=31&artid;=200708110005&sdate;= The photograph of Dr Gan with the flower clearly shows that the coronal ring is in width; the largest corona ever reported anywhere. The plant is a parasite to the wild grapes of the genus Tetrastigma (T. leucostaphylum, T. papillosum and T. quadrangulum), but only the flowers are visible. Small buds appear along the trunk and roots of the host, which after 9 months open the giant flowers. After just one week the flower dies. The species seems to be flowering seasonally, as flowers are only reported during the dry season, from January to March, and more rarely till July. The flower is endangered. Though already naturally rare, tourists trying to get close to the flower for photos easily trample the host plant or young buds. Also the locals collect both buds and flowers both as a delicacy as well as for its claimed medical powers. A concoction of cooked buds or flowers is used as a general tonic, to help for fever or backache or even as a sexual stimulant. However, western medicine doesn't recognize any medical power of the flower. The flower is the symbol flower of Surat Thani Province, which is the location of the Khao Sok NP. Discovery The species is named after the Irish botanist A.F.G. Kerr (1877‚Äì1942), the first botanist to collect plants extensively in Thailand. It was Kerr who first collected a specimen of this species in 1927, and further three till 1929. The specimen later used as the type specimen was collected on February 3, 1929 at Khao Pho Ta Luang Kaeo near Ranong. It was scientifically collected several times afterwards, believed to be R. patma.

XLI manifests with dry, scaly skin and is due to deletions or mutations in the STS gene. XLI can also occur in the context of larger deletions causing contiguous gene syndromes. Treatment is largely aimed at alleviating the skin symptoms.: Treatment Section The term is from the Ancient Greek 'ichthys' meaning 'fish'.  Signs and symptoms  X linked ichthyosis The major symptoms of XLI include scaling of the skin, particularly on the neck, trunk, and lower extremities. The extensor surfaces are typically the most severely affected areas. The >4 mm diameter scales adhere to the underlying skin and can be dark brown or gray in color. Symptoms may subside during the summer. = Associated medical conditions = Aside from the skin scaling, XLI is not typically associated with other major medical problems.

Female carriers generally do not experience any of these problems but can have difficulty during childbirth, as the STS expressed in the placenta plays a role in normal labor. Female carriers may also be at slightly increased risk of developing mental health problems following childbirth Cavenagh A, Chatterjee S, Davies W (2019) Behavioural and psychiatric phenotypes in female carriers of genetic mutations associated with X-linked ichthyosis. PLoS One 14(2):e0212330 PMID:30768640 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0212330 URL:https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212330 For these reasons carriers should ensure their obstetrician is aware of the condition.  Genetics  X linked ichthyosis - this boy has an infant brother and maternal uncle with the same affliction The STS gene is located on the X chromosome at band Xp22.3. Thus, the syndrome is an X-linked condition, and it affects males and females differently. The 23rd pair of chromosomes is typically termed the \\"sex chromosomes\\". Females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Therefore, in normal individuals, males carry a single copy of the STS gene and females carry two copies. This gene partially escapes X-inactivation and females normally express higher amounts of the STS enzyme than males. XLI can occur through new deletions or mutations of the STS gene but is more commonly inherited from a carrier mother. A hemizygous deletion or mutation of the STS gene in a male results in complete absence of enzyme activity, while a female carrier of a mutation or deletion is heterozygous and still has a normal copy of the STS gene. Female carriers of an STS deletion or mutation still express the STS enzyme, although with decreased enzyme activity. For this reason, XLI most commonly affects males, although individuals with numeric abnormalities of the sex chromosomes (45,X and 47,XXY) who also carry STS deletions or mutations would be exceptions to this rule. In addition, a female could be affected if she were the offspring of an affected male and a carrier female and inherited a deletion or mutation of the STS gene on both X chromosomes. = Genetic counseling issues = Since the majority of cases appear to occur through transmission of an STS deletion from a carrier mother, enzyme testing or DNA testing should be performed in the mother of any newly diagnosed simplex case (i.e. the first case in a family). In the case of an extended family with many affected individuals, carrier status can often be assigned based on pedigree analysis. * Males with XLI will transmit the X chromosome harboring the STS deletion or mutation to each of his female offspring, who will therefore be an obligate carrier. However, all male offspring will be unaffected, since they receive their father's Y chromosome. * Female carriers of an STS deletion or mutation have a 50% chance with each pregnancy of transmitting it to an offspring. Thus, each male offspring has a 50% chance of being affected by XLI, while each female offspring has a 50% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Any individual that inherits the mother's normal copy of the STS gene will be unaffected and will have an extremely low chance of having a child affected with this condition. Due to random segregation of the chromosomes during gametogenesis, each pregnancy will be subject to the same probabilities, regardless of the number of previously affected or unaffected offspring. The above recurrence risks are based on the assumption that an affected male or carrier female will have children with an unaffected or non-carrier individual. The risks of having affected offspring would clearly increase in the case of a union between a male with XLI and a carrier female. =Physiology/biochemistry= DHEA sulfate The STS enzyme (EC 3.1.6.2), also referred to as Arylsulfatase C, is expressed throughout the body, with highest expression in the skin, liver, lymph nodes, and placenta, and lower expression in breast tissue and brain STS catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfated steroids, such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), to non- sulfated steroids estradiol and androstenediol, respectively. Prenatally, the enzyme is involved in placental estrogen production. The enzyme is also involved in adrenal steroid production as well as conversion of sulfated steroids in other tissues. There seems to be a particularly important role for the enzyme in skin. Deficiency of the enzyme leads to the characteristic dry and scaly skin seen in ichthyosis. Recent research indicates that the skin abnormalities seen in XLI may be due to accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in the outer epidermis, leading to abnormal barrier function and corneocyte retention.  Diagnosis  XLI can be suspected based on clinical findings, although symptoms can take varying amounts of time to become evident, from a few hours after birth, up to a year in milder cases. The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist, who also typically formulates the treatment plan (see below). STS enzyme deficiency is confirmed using a clinically available biochemical assay. Carrier detection can be performed in mothers of affected sons using this test (see Genetics, below). Molecular testing for DNA deletions or mutations is also offered, and can be particularly useful in the evaluation of individuals with associated medical conditions (see below). Prenatal diagnosis is possible using either biochemical or molecular tests. However, the use of prenatal diagnosis for genetic conditions that are considered to be generally benign raises serious ethical considerations and requires detailed genetic counseling. Treatment Because XLI is caused by a gene mutation or deletion, there is no \\"cure.\\" One of the aims of treatment is to reduce scaling by removing the excess, flaky scales, and keep the skin hydrated. This can be achieved using a variety of topical creams. * Keratolytic agents such as Ammonium lactate (Lac-Hydrin) are used to facilitate the release of retained corneocytes. * Topical isotretinoin * The topical receptor-selective retinoid tazarotene Research is ongoing with regard to the use of gene therapy to treat XLI.

She currently writes a column for the Daily Mail. Early life Mooney was born in Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, to Gladys (n√©e Norbury) and Edward Mooney. She spent her earliest years in Liverpool on a council estate called The Green on Queen's Drive. She passed her 11-plus and went to Aigburth Vale High School for Girls. Mooney moved to Wiltshire at the age of fourteen, when her parents bought their first house. She then attended school in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, at Trowbridge Girls' High School (a girls' grammar school which merged with a boys' grammar school to become the comprehensive The John of Gaunt School in 1974). She passed eight O levels and took English, Latin and Art at A level. She applied unsuccessfully to the University of Oxford (at that time nobody from her school had been admitted to Oxford), and went on to study English Language and Literature at University College London, where she obtained a distinguished First in 1969. She met philosophy student Jonathan Dimbleby while they were both working on the student newspaper Pi. Dimbleby became her first husband; they married in February 1968 in Kensington after knowing each other for four months. Career Giving up her idea of postgraduate work, Mooney became a journalist in 1969, contributing first to the Bath Chronicle and the Times Educational Supplement (whilst teaching part- time in Bath) then got her first job on Nova Magazine as Assistant to the Editor. In the early 1970s, Mooney wrote for the New Statesman, the Daily Telegraph Magazine, Cosmopolitan and many others. From 1979‚Äì80 she was a columnist on the Daily Mirror. She has also been a regular columnist for The Times (2005‚Äì07), The Sunday Times (1982‚Äì83) and The Listener (1984‚Äì86). From 1970 to 1979 she was a freelance journalist. (Her reference to Margaret Thatcher in Nova magazine in 1973 as a 'possible future Prime Minister' is believed to have been the first suggestion of its kind in the media.) In January 1976 she wrote a deeply personal article for the Guardian newspaper about the experience of having a stillborn child. This article was to have far-reaching effects as it was the first time a journalist had written on the subject with such raw feeling, and it directly inspired a shift in the awareness of how to treat stillbirth. She was instrumental in the foundation of the Stillbirth Society, later to be known as Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society. As well as her fiction (see below) Mooney has written many other books, including 'Bel Mooney's Somerset' (1989) and a memoir about love, loss, recovery ‚Äì and dogs: 'Small Dogs Can Save Your Life' (2010). =Novelist and children's author= Having made her name as a journalist, columnist, and a broadcaster, she turned her hand to writing fiction for adults and children. In 1985 she collaborated with Gerald Scarfe on a satire on Margaret Thatcher and her government, called Father Kissmas and Mother Claws. Mooney's novels for adults are The Windsurf Boy (1983), The Anderson Question (1985), The Fourth of July (1988), Lost Footsteps (1993), Intimate Letters (1993) and The Invasion of Sand (2005). She is the author of the best-selling Kitty and Friends series of stories for young girls, including I Don't Want To! and So What?, which were inspired by her own daughter, Katherine. There were 13 volumes in all, published 1985‚Äì2002. She then went on to write a series of six books inspired by her small dog Bonnie, with titles like Big Dog Bonnie and Brave Dog Bonnie. In all, she published 26 books for children and young people. In addition, Bel Mooney has written many short stories for magazines and collections. Published in France as Petula, Big Dog Bonnie was shortlisted for the prestigious Prix Tam-Tam in France. Her fiction (adults and children) has been translated into twelve languages. Mooney has reviewed fiction and non-fiction for many newspapers including the Spectator, the Observer, the Times and the Times Literary Supplement. She has been a judge for the Whitbread (now Costa) Book of the Year (1986) and the Orange Prize (2008). =Broadcasting= She was a regular broadcaster on BBC Radio 4 from 1982 until 2008, notably as presenter of Devout Sceptics, a programme devoted to public figures' private beliefs ‚Äì the participants were not necessarily agnostic or atheistic, as the title might suggest. She also made many series for Channel 4 (for example Mothers By Daughters, 1983) and BBC2 (Grief, 1994) and one-off documentaries on people including Ellen Wilkinson MP and Dora Russell. In the '90s Mooney was interviewed many times on radio and television in connection with environmental campaigning. In particular she was involved, like her former husband, in the campaign against the Batheaston Bypass in the 1993‚Äì95. During the '80s and '90s she wrote six novels and made many programmes for television and for Radio 4. =Daily Mail= In June 2007 she began writing a weekly column for the Saturday edition of the Daily Mail (after two years in the same role at The Times), advising readers on emotional and relationship issues, and she contributes other comment articles to the paper as well as regular book reviews. =Awards and charitable work= She was awarded the degree, Hon D.Litt., from the University of Bath in 1998 and appointed Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2002 and is a Fellow of University College London. Devout Sceptics (BBC Radio 4) won a Sandford St Martin Trust award for religious broadcasting, and the children's novel The Voices of Silence won a New York Public Library Book of the Year citation and was shortlisted for a Gold Medal in the state of California. She has won special awards for journalism from charities including CRUSE. In the '90s she was involved in the establishment of a new literary festival in Bath, and introduced the first ever 'performer', Ted Hughes, in 1996. From 2002 until 2011 she was involved in charitable fund-raising in Bath, as Chairman of the Egg Appeal (to built a dedicated theatre for young people), as President of the Royal United Hospital appeal to build a new NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care) unit, and as Chair of the 2010 appeal to refurbish the Theatre Royal, Bath, Somerset. She served on the board of directors of that theatre until 2015. Mooney is also Patron of National Family Mediation (NFM) and Relate.

A Connecticut resident, he was married to art historian Betty Rogers Rubenstein (deceased 2013).  Education  Rubenstein began his tertiary education at Hebrew Union College, an institution within the Reform Judaism tradition. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a B.A. degree. He then was awarded the Master of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Conservative tradition) and was also ordained as a rabbi by that institution. He then studied at Harvard Divinity School and was awarded a Master of Sacred Theology degree. Finally, he pursued doctoral studies and received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, in 1960. Rubenstein has two honorary doctorates: Doctor of Hebrew Letters (Jewish Theological Seminary) and Doctor of Humane Letters (Grand Valley State University).  Career  Following his ordination in 1952, Rubenstein was the rabbi of two Massachusetts congregations in succession, and then in 1956 became assistant director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at Harvard University, Radcliffe and Wellesley, where he served until 1958. From 1958 to 1970 he was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon University and Duquesne University. At the University of Pittsburgh he also taught an upper division course on French Existentialism. Rubenstein taught in religious studies at Florida State University from 1970 to 1995 and held the professorial chair. He then became president and professor of Religion at the University of Bridgeport, where he served from 1995 to 1999. \\"A Brief Biographical Note\\", University of Bridgeport website, June 2003 Accessed 2008-09-14 Rubenstein has also been a newspaper columnist for a Japanese newspaper and has written many books concerned with the Holocaust, theology, Jewish-Christian relations, ethics, and politics.  The Holocaust and death of God  Rubenstein emerged in the 1960s as a significant writer on the meaning and impact of the Holocaust for Judaism. His first book, After Auschwitz, explored radical theological frontiers in Jewish thought. Rubenstein argued that the experience of the Holocaust shattered the traditional Judaic concept of God, especially as the God of the covenant with Abraham, in which the God of Israel is the God of history. Rubenstein argued that Jews could no longer advocate the notion of an omnipotent God at work in history or espouse the election of Israel as the chosen people. In the wake of the Holocaust, he believed that Jews have lost hope and there is no ultimate meaning to life. > [A]s children of the Earth, we are undeceived concerning our destiny. We > have lost all hope, consolation and illusion.After Auschwitz, p. 70 In After Auschwitz, Rubenstein argued that the covenant had died. He did not mean he was now an atheist, nor that religion had to be discarded as irrelevant. However, he believed not in a transcendent God, but in God as the ground of being: > Terms like \\"ground\\" and \\"source\\" stand in contrast to the terms used for the > transcendent biblical God of history who is known as a supreme king, a > father, a creator, a judge, a maker. When he creates the world, he does so > as do males, producing something external to himself. He remains essentially > outside of and judges the creative processes he has initiated. As ground and > source, God creates as does a mother, in and through her own very substance. > As ground of being, God participates in all the joys and sorrows of the > drama of creation which is, at the same time, the deepest expression of the > divine life. God's unchanging unitary life and that of the cosmos' ever- > changing, dynamic multiplicity ultimately reflect a single unitary > reality.After Auschwitz, ch. 16 > http://www.newenglishreview.org/Richard_L._Rubenstein/God_after_the_Death_of_God/ Rubenstein explored what the nature and form of religious existence could possibly comprise after Auschwitz (e.g., after the experience of the Holocaust). He suggested that perhaps the way forward was to choose some form of paganism. When his work was released in 1966, it appeared at a time when a \\"death of God\\" movement was emerging in radical theological discussions among Protestant theologians such as Gabriel Vahanian, Paul Van Buren, William Hamilton, and Thomas J. J. Altizer. Among those Protestants, the discussions centred on modern secular unbelief, the collapse of the belief in any transcendent order to the universe, and their implications for Christianity. Theologians such as Altizer felt at the time that \\"as 'Death of God' theologians we have now been joined by a distinguished Jewish theologian, Dr Richard Rubenstein.\\"John Warwick Montgomery and Thomas J. J. Altizer, The Altizer-Montgomery Dialogue: A Chapter in the God is Dead Controversy (InterVarsity Press, Chicago, 1967), p.7 During the 1960s, the \\"Death of God\\" movement achieved considerable notoriety and was featured as the cover story of the April 8, 1966, edition of Time magazine. However, as a movement of thought among theologians in Protestant circles, it had dissipated from its novelty by the turn of the 1970s. Unification Church Rubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council,Richard L. Rubenstein Papers, American Jewish Archives as well as on the board of directors of the church-owned Washington Times newspaper.\\"Rabbi Joins the Board of Moonie Newspaper\\", The Palm Beach Post, May 21, 1978 In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport, which was then affiliated with the church.U. of Bridgeport Honors Rev.

The type species, D. brevitertius, is considered a synonym of Ornithomimus edmontonicus by some authors, while others consider it a distinct and valid taxon. Taxonomy Skeleton at Canadian Museum of Nature Size comparison of UALVP 16182 The type species, D. brevitertius was originally described as a species of Struthiomimus by William Parks in 1926 on the basis of a partial postcranium, ROM 797, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.Parks, 1926. Struthiomimus brevetertius - A new species of dinosaur from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta. Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, series 3. 20(4), 65-70. In his review of Canadian ornithomimids, Dale Russell made S. brevitertius the type species of a new genus, Dromiceiomimus, meaning \\"emu mimic\\" from the old generic name for the emu, Dromiceius. Russell also synonymized Struthiomimus ingens with Dromiceimimus brevitertius. He renamed Ornithomimus samueli into a second Dromiceiomimus species: Dromiceiomimus samueli. Dromiceiomimus was distinguished from Ornithomimus edmontonicus on the basis of the following characters: humerus shorter than scapula; ulna ~70% of femoral length; preacetabular process, tibia, metatarsus and pedal digit III longer compared to femur.Russell, D. (1972). \\"Ostrich dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of western Canada.\\" Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 9: 375-402. In a 1981 publication, however, Nicholls and Russell cast doubt on the validity of Dromiceiomimus and though keeping it distinct from Ornithomimus argued that the limb proportions might be insufficient to distinguish ornithomimid taxa from each other.Nicholls and Russell, 1981. A new specimen of Struthiomimus altus from Alberta, with comments on the classificatory characters of Upper Cretaceous ornithomimids. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. 18, 518-526. In the second edition of the Dinosauria, Makovicky et al. claimed that there is no statistical support for the distinction of Dromiceiomimus from Ornithomimus, and synonymized it with Ornithomimus edmontonicus Sternberg 1933.Makovicky, Kobayashi and Currie, 2004. Ornithomimosauria. In Weishampel, Dodson and Osmolska (eds). The Dinosauria Second Edition. University of California Press. 137-150. However, a few authors continued to treat Dromiceiomimus as valid, and Longrich (2008, 2014) treated ROM 840 (holotype of Struthiomimus samueli) as a distinct species of ornithomimid related to Ornithomimus.P.

For osteoporosis it is less preferred than bisphosphonates. It is also used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling, and joint pain. Severe side effects may include blood clots and stroke. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The medication may worsen menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and therefore a mixed agonist‚Äìantagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). It has estrogenic effects in bone and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts and uterus. Raloxifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 3.50 ¬£ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about $16. In 2017, it was the 330th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. Medical uses Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Raloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%. Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk. Contraindications Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant. It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis. Side effects Common side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25‚Äì28% vs. 18‚Äì21% for placebo), vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo).Raloxifene label Last updated 09/2007] Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer. It does not appear to affect cognition or memory. Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects. Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women ( = 3.1). Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen. In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole. A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene, used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. A recent human case report in July 2016 suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug. Unlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer ( = 0.8). Raloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women. Overdose Raloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Mechanism of action Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues. It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus. Its affinity (Kd) for the ERŒ± is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERŒ± and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERŒ≤. Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERŒ± and as a pure antagonist of the ERŒ≤. In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein- coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) ( = 10‚Äì100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor. Clinical effects Raloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies. In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer. It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women. This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals. In premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol. Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women. In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels. Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene. Raloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis. It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine. Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in vitro. The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women. Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors. For these reasons, raloxifene increases the risk of thrombosis. Raloxifene increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women but decreases it in premenopausal women. In the MORE trial, the risk of vertebral fractures was decreased by 30%, and bone mineral density was increased in the spine (by 2.1% at 60 mg, 2.4% at 120 mg) and femoral neck (2.6% at 60 mg, 2.7% at 120 mg). It has been found to possess estrogenic effects in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women, promoting a shift from an android fat distribution to a gynoid fat distribution. The medication has been found to increase levels of leptin, an adipokine. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption The absorption of raloxifene is approximately 60%. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is only 2.0%. Raloxifene is rapidly absorbed from the intestines upon oral administration. Peak plasma levels of raloxifene occur 0.5 to 6 hours after an oral dose. Distribution Raloxifene is widely distributed throughout the body. There is extensive distribution of raloxifene into the liver, serum, lungs, and kidneys. The volume of distribution of raloxifene with a single 30 to 150 mg oral dose is approximately 2348 L. Both raloxifene and its metabolites show high plasma protein binding (>95%), including to both albumin and Œ±1 acid glycoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin. Metabolism Raloxifene is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. It is metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation and is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Less than 1% of radiolabeled material in plasma comprises unconjugated raloxifene. The metabolites of raloxifene include several glucuronides. The elimination half-life of raloxifene after a single dose is 27.7 hours (1.2 days), whereas its half-life at steady state at a dosage of 60 mg/day is 15.8 to 86.6 hours (0.7‚Äì3.6 days), with an average of 32.5 hours (1.4 days). The extended half-life of raloxifene is attributed to enterohepatic recirculation and its high plasma protein binding. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible metabolism and enterohepatic recycling, which prolongs the elimination half-life of raloxifene with oral administration. The medication is deconjugated into its active form in a variety of tissues, including liver, lungs, spleen, bone, uterus, and kidneys. Elimination Raloxifene is mainly excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces. Less than 0.2% of a dose is excreted unchanged in urine and less than 6% of a dose is excreted in urine as glucuronide conjugates. Chemistry Raloxifene hydrochloride has the empirical formula C28H27NO4S‚Ä¢HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene hydrochloride is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene derivative and is structurally distinct from the triphenylethylene SERMs like tamoxifen, clomifene, and toremifene. It is the only benzothiophene SERM to have been marketed. A benzothiophene SERM that was not marketed is arzoxifene (LY-353381). Bazedoxifene (Duavee, Viviant) and pipendoxifene (ERA-923) are structurally related to raloxifene but are technically not benzothiophenes and instead are indoles. History Raloxifene was approved in the United States for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1997, the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1999, and to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain postmenopausal women in 2007. It received orphan designation in 2005. Society and culture A bottle of raloxifene. =Names= Raloxifene is the generic name of the drug and its and , while raloxif√®ne is its and raloxifene hydrochloride is its , , and . It has also been known by the name keoxifene. Raloxifene is sold mainly under the brand name Evista and to a lesser extent the brand name Optruma. It is also sold under a variety of other brand names in various countries. =Availability= Raloxifene is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, and elsewhere in the world such as in Israel and Egypt. Raloxifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. =Controversy= An editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that research about the medication for breast cancer prevention was released. Research Clinical studies of raloxifene for metastatic breast cancer in women have been conducted but found little effectiveness at 60 mg/day in those previously treated with tamoxifen, though modest effectiveness has been observed at higher doses. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Raloxifene has been studied in men for a variety of uses, such as for treatment of schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis. It has been studied in combination with castration and bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Raloxifene has been studied as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia in postmenopausal women. A 2017 meta-analysis concluded that it was safe and effective for this indication, although further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for confirmation. It may be effective in women with less severe symptoms. A tissue-selective estrogen-receptor complex (TSEC) of estradiol and raloxifene has been studied in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene (60 mg/day) was reported to be effective in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia in adolescent boys in a small retrospective chart review. Other SERMs are also known to be effective in the treatment of gynecomastia. Raloxifene has been reported to augment the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). June 18th 2020, Exscalate4CoV, the private-public consortium supported by the EU‚Äôs Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation, led by Domp√© farmaceutici and currently representing 18 partners (including Fraunhofer Institute, CINECA, Chelonia Applied Science, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and others) has requested access to clinical trials for the use of Raloxifene in Covid 19 patients. Raloxifene, already proven effective against Mers and Sars in precliinical tests, has been indicated as effective against Sars-Cov2 by the ‚Äúin-silico‚Äù research conducted by the consortium which has shown efficacy in countering the replication of the virus in cells.

It is primarily about George Washington's leadership during the 1776 campaign of the American Revolutionary War, culminating with George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River and the subsequent campaign, with the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, and the Battle of Princeton.  Organization  Fischer discusses the historical context of the crossing, including the crossing's precursors, the intensity of effort required to make the crossing itself, and the effects upon the outcome of the American Revolutionary War made possible by the success of the crossing and the brilliant exploitation. He follows up with more than 180 pages, divided into appendices, source citations, and acknowledgements. Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware Using as his starting point, the famous painting \\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\\" by Emmanuel Leutze, Fischer continues through the shift in momentum resulting from this campaign. He shows that before the crossing, the British were intent upon attacking and defeating the revolutionaries. After the crossing and subsequent campaign, the British focused on being attacked. Fischer proceeds through the aftermath and finishes with a discussion of how a new, American way of fighting developed during the campaign surrounding the crossing, including an entrepreneurial spirit and a policy of humanity. The goal-oriented spirit still guides America's warfare: to win the war and then to return to everyday life with all dispatch. The Americans' policy of humanity to their defeated opponents was so attractive that large numbers of the Hessian enemy stayed in America, and more returned with their families following the war.  Acclaim  Fischer's work is admired as one of the most comprehensive books on the critical and suspenseful turning point of the American War of Independence. The book was published in February 2004 and it won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for History.

He is the CEO of StoryBrand, a marketing company. He is also an author of personal essays and reflections about faith, God, and self-discovery. His first New York Times bestselling book was Blue Like Jazz and his latest book is called Building a StoryBrand. Biography At 21, Miller left his home in Pearland, Texas and went to Portland, Oregon, where he owned a small Portland-based textbook publishing company called Coffee House Books. Miller became a New York Times Bestselling Author when he published Blue Like Jazz in 2003. In 2004, Miller released Searching For God Knows What, which discusses how the traditional understanding of the gospel of Jesus aligns with a theory of personality. In 2005, he released Through Painted Deserts, a republished version of his first book, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance, originally published in 2000. In 2006, he wrote another book, To Own A Dragon, on his reflections on growing up without a father. Miller is also the founder of The Mentoring Project, a non-profit that partners with local churches to mentor fatherless young men. Miller's next book, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, was released in late 2009. In 2009, Miller served on a Presidential Advisory Council on Fatherhood and Healthy Families. On November 30, 2013 Donald Miller married Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Miltenberger. They now live in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2015, he published a book called Scary Close, discussing his views and personal history of self- discovery and intimacy in relationships. In 2015 Miller helped The Federation for Children create the Failing Our Kids campaign that lobbied state governments for school voucher programs. In early 2016 Miller consulted with Fox River Partnerships, an economic think tank in Illinois, to develop a messaging campaign for a new economic and tax plan called a Circulation Economy. The Circulation Economy plan was created by Joe Ritchie and aims to shift America's economic machine from a trading-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy. In 2017, he released his latest book, Building a StoryBrand, on marketing and messaging. He presents a marketing framework inspired by principles of storytelling called the StoryBrand 7 Part Framework. The framework is made up of 7 parts: # A character who wants and needs something # The character's problem # A guide who helps the character # A plan that is delivered by the guide. # A call to action. The guide calls the character to action. # Success - the call to action results in success or the 7th part (failure). # Failure - the call to action results in failure. In this framework, the \\"main character\\" of one's branding and marketing is the customer, not the brand. The brand plays the role of the guide ‚Äî leading the \\"main character\\" to success.

The DN model poses scientific explanation as a deductive structure‚Äîthat is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion‚Äîhinged on accurate prediction or postdiction of the phenomenon to be explained. Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know causality, this was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that derive the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general laws. Still, the DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors. Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers. When logical empiricism fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to modern physics. In the early 1980s, a revision to the DN model emphasized maximal specificity for relevance of the conditions and axioms stated. Together with Hempel's inductive-statistical model, the DN model forms scientific explanation's covering law model, which is also termed, from critical angle, subsumption theory.  Form  The term deductive distinguishes the DN model's intended determinism from the probabilism of inductive inferences. The term nomological is derived from the Greek word ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ or nomos, meaning \\"law\\".Woodward, \\"Scientific explanation\\", ¬ß2 \\"The DN model\\", in SEP, 2011. The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose conditions of adequacy (CA)‚Äîsemiformal but stated classically‚Äîare derivability (CA1), lawlikeness (CA2), empirical content (CA3), and truth (CA4).James Fetzer, ch 3 \\"The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation\\", in Fetzer, ed, Science, Explanation, and Rationality (Oxford U P, 2000), p 113. In the DN model, a law axiomatizes an unrestricted generalization from antecedent A to consequent B by conditional proposition‚ÄîIf A, then B‚Äîand has empirical content testable.Montuschi, Objects in Social Science (Continuum, 2003), pp 61‚Äì62. A law differs from mere true regularity‚Äîfor instance, George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet‚Äîby supporting counterfactual claims and thus suggesting what must be true,Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 2, subch \\"DN model of explanation and HD model of theory development\\", pp 25‚Äì26. while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 2, subch \\"Axiomatic account of theories\\", pp 27‚Äì29. The phenomenon to be explained is the explanandum‚Äîan event, law, or theory‚Äîwhereas the premises to explain it are explanans, true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.Suppe, \\"Afterword‚Äî1977\\", \\"Introduction\\", ¬ß1 \\"Swan song for positivism\\", ¬ß1A \\"Explanation and intertheoretical reduction\\", pp 619‚Äì24, in Suppe, ed, Structure of Scientific Theories, 2nd edn (U Illinois P, 1977).

Roots  Aristotle's scientific explanation in Physics resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.Kenneth F Schaffner, \\"Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences\\", pp 79‚Äì125, in Laudan, ed, Mind and Medicine (U California P, 1983), p 81. The framework of Aristotelian physics‚ÄîAristotelian metaphysics‚Äîreflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized vitalism and teleology, an intrinsic morality in nature.G Montalenti, ch 2 \\"From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin\\", in Ayala & Dobzhansky, eds, Studies in the Philosophy of Biology (U California P, 1974). With emergence of Copernicanism, however, Descartes introduced mechanical philosophy, then Newton rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within natural philosophy.In the 17th century, Descartes as well as Isaac Newton firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found teleology to be outside science's inquiry (Bolotin, Approach to Aristotle's Physics, pp 31‚Äì33). By 1650, formalizing heliocentrism and launching mechanical philosophy, Cartesian physics overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy. Newton more especially sought the laws of nature‚Äîsimply the regularities of phenomena‚Äîwhereby Newtonian physics, reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800. At 1740, David HumeNicknames for principles attributed to Hume‚ÄîHume's fork, problem of induction, Hume's law‚Äîwere not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference. staked Hume's fork,By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as formal sciences are universal through \\"relations of ideas\\"‚Äîsimply abstract truths‚Äîthus knowable without experience. On the other hand, the claimed truths of empirical sciences are contingent on \\"fact and real existence\\", knowable only upon experience. By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross. Any treatises containing neither can contain only \\"sophistry and illusion\\". (Flew, Dictionary, \\"Hume's fork\\", p 156). highlighted the problem of induction,Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming constant conjunction, make the unrestricted generalization of an enumerative induction, and justify it by presuming uniformity of nature. Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience‚Äîthe problem of induction‚Äîhow humans irrationally presume discovery of causality. (Chakraborti, Logic, p 381; Flew, Dictionary, \\"Hume\\", p 156. and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.For more discursive discussions of types of causality‚Äînecessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, counterfactual‚Äîsee Rothman & Greenland, Parascandola & Weed, as well as Kundi. Following is more direct elucidation: A necessary cause is a causal condition required for an event to occur. A sufficient cause is a causal condition complete to produce an event. Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors‚Äîthat is, other component causes‚Äîmight be required to produce the event. Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event. Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors. And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs. (Language can state necessary causality as a tautology‚Äîa statement whose terms' arrangement and meanings render it is logically true by mere definition‚Äîwhich, as an analytic statement, is uninformative about the actual world. A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a synthetic statement, rather.) Sufficient causality is more actually sufficient component causality‚Äîa complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation‚Äîwhich, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover. Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as necessary and sufficient‚Äîa single factor both required and complete‚Äîthe one and only cause, the cause. One may so view flipping a light switch. The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors‚Äîintact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, explanation of electricity by James Clerk Maxwell, harnessing of electricity by Benjamin Franklin, metal refining, metal mining, and on and on‚Äîwhile, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery. From a Humean perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on. If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's mind, but one's mind cannot know that the event violated nature. As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip. Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew p 156). Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject metaphysics, Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew p 154). Hume thus placed his own theory of knowledge on par with Newton's theory of motion (Buckle pp 70‚Äì71, Redman pp 182‚Äì83, Schliesser ¬ß abstract). Hume found enumerative induction an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei pp 28‚Äì29). Hume found constant conjunction to reveal a modest causality type: counterfactual causality. Silent as to causal role‚Äîwhether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism‚Äîcounterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest. Hume also highlighted the fact/value gap, as what is does not itself reveal what ought.Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating norms‚Äîsupposedly what should be‚Äîwith barely explanation. Yet such values, as in ethics or aesthetics or political philosophy, are not found true merely by stating facts: is does not itself reveal ought. Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable‚Äîthat no statements of facts can ever justify norms‚Äîalthough Hume himself did not state that. Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it. Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by communal reinforcement. (Flew, Dictionary, \\"Hume's law\\", p 157 & \\"Naturalistic fallacy\\", pp 240‚Äì41; Wootton, Modern Political Thought, p 306.) Near 1780, countering Hume's ostensibly radical empiricism, Immanuel Kant highlighted extreme rationalism‚Äîas by Descartes or Spinoza‚Äîand sought middle ground. Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into substance, space, and time, Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found Newton's theory of motion universally true, Kant inferred that the mind's constants arrange space holding Euclidean geometry‚Äîlike Newton's absolute space‚Äîwhile objects interact temporally as modeled in Newton's theory of motion, whose law of universal gravitation is a truth synthetic a priori, that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience. Thus, the mind's innate constants cross the tongs of Hume's fork and lay Newton's universal gravitation as a priori truth. yet knowledge of things in themselves impossible. Safeguarding science, then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of scientific realism. Aborting Francis Bacon's inductivist mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the noumena‚Äîmetaphysical view of nature's ultimate truths‚ÄîKant's transcendental idealism tasked science with simply modeling patterns of phenomena. Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the mind's constants holding also universal moral truths,Whereas a hypothetical imperative is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the categorical imperative is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do. and launched German idealism, increasingly speculative. Auguste Comte found the problem of induction rather irrelevant since enumerative induction is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth. Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific‚Äîthe ultimate stage‚Äîrejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable. Comte in the 1830s expounded positivism‚Äîthe first modern philosophy of science and simultaneously a political philosophyBourdeau, \\"Auguste Comte\\", ¬ß¬ß \\"Abstract\\" & \\"Introduction\\", in Zalta, ed, SEP, 2013.‚Äîrejecting conjectures about unobservables, thus rejecting search for causes.Comte, A General View of Positivism (Tr√ºbner, 1865), pp 49‚Äì50, including the following passage: \\"As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination. These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts\\". Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a law, thereupon applied to benefit human society.Flew, Dictionary (St Martin's, 1984), \\"Positivism\\", p 283. From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe. Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's natural selection brought the Copernican Revolution into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to vitalism and teleology. Growth Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as description, logical positivism emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as explanation, perhaps to better unify empirical sciences by covering not only fundamental science‚Äîthat is, fundamental physics‚Äîbut special sciences, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and anthropology.Woodward, \\"Scientific explanation\\", ¬ß1 \\"Background and introduction\\", in SEP, 2011. After defeat of National Socialism with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, logical empiricism.Friedman, Reconsidering Logical Positivism (Cambridge U P, 1999), p xii. All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,Any positivism placed in the 20th century is generally neo, although there was Ernst Mach's positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science‚Äîtraceable to the inductivist trend from Bacon at 1620, the Newtonian research program at 1687, and Comptean positivism at 1830‚Äîthat continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences. sharing the quest of verificationism.Neopositivists are sometimes called \\"verificationists\\". Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline philosophy of science, researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge. Scientific realism takes scientific theory's statements at face value, thus accorded either falsity or truth‚Äîprobable or approximate or actual.Chakravartty, \\"Scientific realism\\", ¬ß1.2 \\"The three dimensions of realist commitment\\", in SEP, 2013: \\"Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world. In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'. According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false. This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so- called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports. Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today). Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables\\". Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as instrumentalism, holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather. *Chakravartty, \\"Scientific realism\\", ¬ß4 \\"Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism\\", ¬ß4.1 \\"Empiricism\\", in SEP, 2013: \\"Traditionally, instrumentalists maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity. The most influential advocates of instrumentalism were the logical empiricists (or logical positivists), including Carnap and Hempel, famously associated with the Vienna Circle group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere. In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non- literal semantics according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, 'electron' might mean 'white streak in a cloud chamber'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called 'operationalism'). Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of logical empiricism and the growth of realism. The contrast here is not merely in semantics and epistemology: a number of logical empiricists also held the neo-Kantian view that ontological questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on pragmatic grounds), thereby rejecting the metaphysical dimension of realism (as in Carnap 1950)\\". *Okasha, Philosophy of Science (Oxford U P, 2002), p 62: \\"Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti- realism. According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all. So when a scientist puts forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'. Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical. This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today. It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept. The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise. But we will never know which, says the anti-realist. So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism. They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which. Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort\\". DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by Carl G Hempel, first in his 1942 article \\"The function of general laws in history\\", and more explicitly with Paul Oppenheim in their 1948 article \\"Studies in the logic of explanation\\". Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the Humean empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect, as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables. DN model bypasses causality beyond mere constant conjunction: first an event like A, then always an event like B. Hempel held natural laws‚Äîempirically confirmed regularities‚Äîas satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality. In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by inductive-statistical model (IS model). DN model and IS model‚Äîwhereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%‚Äîtogether form covering law model, as named by a critic, William Dray.von Wright, Explanation and Understanding (Cornell U P, 1971), p 11.

Decline Amid failure of neopositivism's fundamental tenets, Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of cognitive meaningfulness, the analytic/synthetic gap, and the observation/theory gap. From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion. In 1951 Willard Van Orman Quine attacked the analytic/synthetic gap. In 1958, Norwood Russell Hanson blurred the observational/theoretical gap. In 1959, Karl Raimund Popper attacked all of verificationism‚Äîhe attacked, actually, any type of positivism‚Äîby asserting falsificationism. In 1962, Thomas Samuel Kuhn overthrew foundationalism, which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism. Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise. Fetzer, \\"Carl Hempel\\", ¬ß3 \\"Scientific reasoning\\", in SEP, 2013: \\"The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position. At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit. Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure. Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of cognitive significance in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, Aspects of Scientific Explanation (1965d). There he proposed that cognitive significance could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach. Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the cognitive significance of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117). The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic‚Äîexplanatory and predictive‚Äîpower of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b). The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement\\". From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting falsificationism, which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.Popper, \\"Against big words\\", In Search of a Better World (Routledge, 1996), pp 89-90.Hacohen, Karl Popper: The Formative Years (Cambridge U P, 2000), pp 212‚Äì13. Even Popper's 1934 bookLogik der Forschung, published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, and arrived in the English-speaking world in 1959. embraces DN model,Woodward, \\"Scientific explanation\\", in Zalta, ed, SEP, 2011, abstract. widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science. In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytologyAs scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell organelles beyond the nucleus. and biochemistry,The first famed biochemistry experiment was Edward Buchner's in 1897 (Morange, A History, p 11). The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating colloids in biological systems, a \\"biocolloidology\\" (Morange p 12; Bechtel, Discovering, p 94). This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term macromolecule introduced by German chemist Hermann Staudinger in 1922 (Morange p 12). cell biology aroseCell biology emerged principally at Rockefeller Institute through new technology (electron microscope and ultracentrifuge) and new techniques (cell fractionation and advancements in staining and fixation). and established existence of cell organelles besides the nucleus. Launched in the late 1930s, the molecular biology research program cracked a genetic code in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as cell and molecular biology, its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.Bechtel, Discovering Cell Mechanisms (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp pp 24‚Äì25. Biology became a new model of science, while special sciences were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics. In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal conditions of adequacy, Hempel and Oppenheim acknowledged redundancy of the third, empirical content, implied by the other three‚Äîderivability, lawlikeness, and truth. In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, Wesley Salmon called for returning cause to because,James Fetzer, ch 3 \\"The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation\\", in Fetzer J, ed, Science, Explanation, and Rationality (Oxford U P, 2000), pp 121‚Äì122. and along with James Fetzer helped replace CA3 empirical content with CA3' strict maximal specificity.Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, Science, Explanation, and Rationality (Oxford U P, 2000), p 129. Salmon introduced causal mechanical explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such. Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced statistical- relevance model (SR model). Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in applied sciences, most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific. Strengths As theory of knowledge, epistemology differs from ontology, which is a subbranch of metaphysics, theory of reality. Ontology poses which categories of being‚Äîwhat sorts of things exist‚Äîand so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 1, subch \\"Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science\\", ¬ß \\"Metaphysics\\", pp 8‚Äì9, ¬ß \\"Epistemology\\", p 11. Natural laws, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological‚Äîconcerning human knowledge‚Äîthe epistemic. Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ontic. Blurring epistemic with ontic‚Äîas by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying‚Äîtends to generate a category mistake.H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop & A Amann, \\"Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws\\", in Khrennikov, ed, Proceedings (World Scientific, 2001), pp 51‚Äì52.Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, Science, Explanation, and Rationality (Oxford U P, 2000), p 118, poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when epistemic can fail as ontic: \\"The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our knowledge of the universe. Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws. First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity. Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature. And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased\\". Discarding ontic commitments, including causality per se, DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to‚Äîthat is, subsumed by‚Äîa more fundamental theory's laws. The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws. Thus, the epistemic success of Newtonian theory's law of universal gravitation is reduced to‚Äîthus explained by‚ÄîAlbert Einstein's general theory of relativity, although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting Kepler's laws of planetary motionThis theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, Philosophy of Physics, pp 60‚Äì62). is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing absolute space despite absolute time. Covering law model reflects neopositivism's vision of empirical science, a vision interpreting or presuming unity of science, whereby all empirical sciences are either fundamental science‚Äîthat is, fundamental physics‚Äîor are special sciences, whether astrophysics, chemistry, biology, geology, psychology, economics, and so on.Reutlinger, Schurz & H√ºttemann, \\"Ceteris paribus\\", ¬ß 1.1 \\"Systematic introduction\\", in Zalta, ed, SEP, 2011.Spohn, Laws of Belief (Oxford U P, 2012), p 305.Whereas fundamental physics has sought laws of universal regularity, special sciences normally include ceteris paribus laws, which are predictively accurate to high probability in \\"normal conditions\\" or with \\"all else equal\\", but have exceptions [Reutlinger et al ¬ß 1.1]. Chemistry's laws seem exceptionless in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman p 5, Schwarz Fig 1, and so are special sciences. All special sciences would network via covering law model.Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch \\"Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories\\" pp 71‚Äì72. And by stating boundary conditions while supplying bridge laws, any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing‚Äîtheoretically although generally not practically‚Äîto fundamental science.Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch \\"Theory reduction model and the unity of science program\\" pp 72‚Äì76. (Boundary conditions are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur. Bridge laws translate terms in one science to terms in another science.)Bem & de Jong, Theoretical Issues (Sage, 2006), pp 45‚Äì47. Weaknesses By DN model, if one asks, \\"Why is that shadow 20 feet long?\\", another can answer, \\"Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at x angle, and laws of electromagnetism\\". Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, \\"Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?\\", another could answer, \\"Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at x angle, and laws of electromagnetism\\", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect. By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, \\"Why did that man not get pregnant?\\", one could in part answer, among the explanans, \\"Because he took birth control pills\\"‚Äîif he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy‚Äîas covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans. Many philosophers have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.O'Shaughnessy, Explaining Buyer Behavior (Oxford U P, 1992), pp 17‚Äì19. DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation‚Äîsuccessful prediction‚Äîbut not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance Z always following Y, but not Z because of Y, instead Y and then Z as an effect of X. By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, Boyle's law permits prediction of an unknown variable‚Äîvolume, pressure, or temperature‚Äîbut does not explain why to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the kinetic theory of gases. Scientific explanations increasingly pose not determinism's universal laws, but probabilism's chance, ceteris paribus laws. Smoking's contribution to lung cancer fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).Bechtel, Philosophy of Science (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 3, subch \\"Repudiation of DN model of explanation\\", pp 38‚Äì39. (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).) An applied science that applies statistics seeking associations between events, epidemiology cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest. Versus nonsmokers, however, smokers as a group showed over 20 times the risk of lung cancer, and in conjunction with basic research, consensus followed that smoking had been scientifically explained as a cause of lung cancer,Boffetta, \\"Causation in the presence of weak associations\\", Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 2010; 50(S1):13‚Äì16. responsible for some cases that without smoking would not have occurred, a probabilistic counterfactual causality.Making no commitment as to the particular causal role‚Äîsuch as necessity, or sufficiency, or component strength, or mechanism‚Äîcounterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor from its factual state prevents or produces by any which way the event of interest.In epidemiology, the counterfactual causality is not deterministic, but probabilistic Covering action Through lawlike explanation, fundamental physics‚Äîoften perceived as fundamental science‚Äîhas proceeded through intertheory relation and theory reduction, thereby resolving experimental paradoxes to great historical success,Schwarz, \\"Recent developments in string theory\\", Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 1998; 95:2750‚Äì7, esp Fig 1. resembling covering law model.Ben- Menahem, Conventionalism (Cambridge U P, 2006), p 71. In early 20th century, Ernst Mach as well as Wilhelm Ostwald had resisted Ludwig Boltzmann's reduction of thermodynamics‚Äîand thereby Boyle's lawInstances of falsity limited Boyle's law to special cases, thus ideal gas law.‚Äîto statistical mechanics partly because it rested on kinetic theory of gas,Spohn, Laws of Belief (Oxford U P, 2012), p 306. hinging on atomic/molecular theory of matter. Mach as well as Ostwald viewed matter as a variant of energy, and molecules as mathematical illusions,Newburgh et al, \\"Einstein, Perrin, and the reality of atoms\\" , Am J Phys, 2006, p 478. as even Boltzmann thought possible.For brief review of Boltmann's view, see ch 3 \\"Philipp Frank\\", ¬ß 1 \\"T S Kuhn's interview\\", in Blackmore et al, eds, Ernst Mach's Vienna 1895‚Äì1930 (Kluwer, 2001), p 63, as Frank was a student of Boltzmann soon after Mach's retirement. See \\"Notes\\", pp 79‚Äì80, #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of Einstein. The more relevant here is #12: \\"Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning atomism. First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the reality of atoms. Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics. Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience. Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after J J Thomson and the distinction between electrons and nuclei. Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905. And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism\\". In 1905, via statistical mechanics, Albert Einstein predicted the phenomenon Brownian motion‚Äîunexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist Robert Brown. Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real. Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in particles, doubted until this helped resolve atomic theory in the 1910s and 1920s. Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as mechanical energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, Everyday Quantum Reality, pp 22‚Äì23). In the 1890s, the problem of blackbody radiation was paradoxical until Max Planck theorized quantum exhibiting Planck's constant‚Äîa minimum unit of energy. The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as particles, yet simply as units of energy. Another paradox, however, was the photoelectric effect. As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency. Within the electromagnetic spectrum's visible portion, frequency sets the color. Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height. In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity‚Äîhigher wave amplitude‚Äîraises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect. And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond‚Äîa certain frequency and higher‚Äîwas found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off. Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital. Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy‚Äîmore total particles‚Äîeach individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron. Einstein's model, far more intricate, used probability theory to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles. This revival of the particle hypothesis of light‚Äîgenerally attributed to Newton‚Äîwas widely doubted. By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in atomic theory, and thus quantum mechanics emerged. In 1926, Gilbert N Lewis termed the particles photons. QED models them as the electromagnetic field's messenger particles or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions. Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or electromagnetic,Wolfson, Simply Einstein (W W Norton & Co, 2003), p 67. whose two theories misaligned.Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated absolute space and absolute time. To fit Young's transverse wave theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with Fresnel's luminiferous aether at 1814. By Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether. Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to‚Äîthus vary in relation to‚Äîlight's speed. Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an interferometer by Michelson & Morley at 1887, revealed no apparent aether drift‚Äîlight speed apparently constant, an absolute. Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible. For brief summary, see Wilczek, Lightness of Being (Basic Books, 2008), pp 78‚Äì80. Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.Cordero, EPSA Philosophy of Science (Springer, 2012), pp 26‚Äì28.Hooper, Aether and Gravitation (Chapman & Hall, 1903), pp 122‚Äì23.Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate mechanical philosophy's founding principle, No instant interaction at a distance (Einstein, \\"Ether\\", Sidelights (Methuen, 1922), pp 15‚Äì18). At experimental paradoxes, Rowlands, Oliver Lodge (Liverpool U P, 1990), pp 159‚Äì60: \\"Lodge's ether experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of special relativity and their significance is usually seen in this context. Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics. Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them. With the emphasis on relativity, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium. It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case. The Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether. Its results‚Äîand the FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz contraction‚Äîcould have been predicted on Heaviside's, or even Maxwell's, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place. The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual. Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists. The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work\\". physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.Mainly Hendrik Lorentz as well as Henri Poincar√© modified electrodynamic theory and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, Einstein's Mistakes, pp 281‚Äì85). Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, Philosophy of Physics, p 180). Finding the luminiferous aether a useless hypothesis,Tavel, Contemporary Physics (Rutgers U P, 2001), pp , 66. Einstein in 1905 a priori unified all inertial reference frames to state special principle of relativity,Introduced soon after Einstein explained Brownian motion, special relativity holds only in cases of inertial motion, that is, unaccelerated motion. Inertia is the state of a body experiencing no acceleration, whether by change in speed‚Äîeither quickening or slowing‚Äîor by change in direction, and thus exhibits constant velocity, which is speed plus direction. which, by omitting aether,Cordero, EPSA Philosophy of Science (Springer, 2012), pp 29‚Äì30. converted space and time into relative phenomena whose relativity aligned electrodynamics with the Newtonian principle Galilean relativity or invariance.To explain absolute light speed without aether, Einstein modeled that a body at motion in an electromagnetic field experiences length contraction and time dilation, which Lorentz and Poincar√© had already modeled as Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction and Lorentz transformation but by hypothesizing dynamic states of the aether, whereas Einstein's special relativity was simply kinematic, that is, positing no causal mechanical explanation, simply describing positions, thus showing how to align measuring devices, namely, clocks and rods. (Ohanian, Einstein's Mistakes, pp 281‚Äì85). Originally epistemic or instrumental, this was interpreted as ontic or realist‚Äîthat is, a causal mechanical explanation‚Äîand the principle became a theory,Ohanian, Einstein's Mistakes (W W Norton, 2008), pp 281‚Äì85. refuting Newtonian gravitation.Newton's theory required absolute space and time. By predictive success in 1919, general relativity apparently overthrew Newton's theory, a revolution in scienceBuchen, \\"May 29, 1919\\", Wired, 2009.

Melia, Black Hole (Princeton U P, 2003), pp 83‚Äì87. resisted by many yet fulfilled around 1930.Crelinsten, Einstein's Jury (Princeton U P, 2006), p 28. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg as well as Erwin Schr√∂dinger independently formalized quantum mechanics (QM).Cushing, Quantum Mechanics (U Chicago P, 1994), pp 113‚Äì18. Despite clashing explanations,Schr√∂dinger's wave mechanics posed an electron's charge smeared across space as a waveform, later reinterpreted as the electron manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely while eventually building up that deterministic waveform. Heisenberg's matrix mechanics confusingly talked of operators acting on quantum states. Richard Feynman introduced QM's path integral formalism‚Äîinterpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient‚Äîpredictively identical with Heisenberg's matrix formalism and with Schr√∂dinger's wave formalism. the two theories made identical predictions. Paul Dirac's 1928 model of the electron was set to special relativity, launching QM into the first quantum field theory (QFT), quantum electrodynamics (QED).Torretti, Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge U P, 1999), pp 393‚Äì95. From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's antiparticle, soon discovered and termed positron,Torretti, Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge U P, 1999), p 394. but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies. Elsewhere and otherwise, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force were discovered.Recognition of strong force permitted Manhattan Project to engineer Little Boy and Fat Man, dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath‚Äîradioactive fallout‚Äîof diverse health consequences. In 1941, Richard Feynman introduced QM's path integral formalism, which if taken toward interpretation as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's matrix formalism and with Schr√∂dinger's wave formalism, although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, Werner Heisenberg as well as Erwin Schr√∂dinger developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, QED, p xiv). Schr√∂dinger introduced wave mechanics, whose wave function is discerned by a partial differential equation, now termed Schr√∂dinger equation (p xiv). Heisenberg, who also stated the uncertainty principle, along with Max Born and Pascual Jordan introduced matrix mechanics, which rather confusingly talked of operators acting on quantum states (p xiv). If taken as causal mechanically explanatory, the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible empirically, that is, when not used for interpretation, and taken as simply formalism (p xv). In 1941, at a party in a tavern in Princeton, New Jersey, visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to Richard Feynman a different formalism suggested by Paul Dirac, who developed bra‚Äìket notation, in 1932 (p xv). The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as sum over histories or sum over paths or path integrals (p xv). Feynman would joke that this approach‚Äîwhich sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient‚Äîabolishes the uncertainty principle (p xvi). All empirically equivalent, Schr√∂dinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi). There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated (p xvii). In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate (pp xvi‚Äìxvii). By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the \\"canonical\\" (p xvii). In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a \\"roaring comeback\\", became the predominant means to make predictions from QFT, and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique (p xviii). Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty. As each known fundamental forceThe four, known fundamental interactions are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed. Louis de Broglie's waveparticle duality had rendered atomism‚Äîindivisible particles in a void‚Äîuntenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.Grandy, Everyday Quantum Reality (Indiana U P, 2010), pp 24‚Äì25. Meeting in 1947, Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga soon introduced renormalization, a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,Torretti, Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge U P, 1999), p 395.Schweber, QED and the Men who Made it (Princeton U P, 1994). subsuming chemistry, optics, and statistical mechanics.Feynman, QED (Princeton U P, 2006), p 5. QED thus won physicists' general acceptance. Paul Dirac criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,Torretti, Philosophy of Physics, (Cambridge U P, 1999), pp 395‚Äì96. and called for an aether.Cushing, Quantum Mechanics (U Chicago P, 1994), pp 158‚Äì59. In 1947, Willis Lamb had found unexpected motion of electron orbitals, shifted since the vacuum is not truly empty.Close, \\"Much ado about nothing\\", Nova, PBS/WGBH, 2012: \\"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when Willis Lamb measured spectrum of hydrogen. The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths. This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on. Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another. According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million. What could be causing this tiny but significant difference? \\"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing. Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons. These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly. This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise. \\"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances. Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something‚Äîor at nothing‚Äîthe more dramatic these energy fluctuations become. Combine that with Einstein's E=mc2, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void. This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing\\". Yet emptiness was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it, even suppressing it. Meanwhile, \\"sickened by untidy math, most philosophers of physics tend to neglect QED\\". Physicists have feared even mentioning aether, *Vongehr \\"Higgs discovery rehabilitating despised Einstein Aether\\", Science 2.0, 2011. * renamed vacuum,Riesselmann \\"Concept of ether in explaining forces\\", Inquiring Minds, Fermilab, 2008. which‚Äîas such‚Äîis nonexistent.Close, \\"Much ado about nothing\\", Nova, PBS/WGBH, 2012. General philosophers of science commonly believe that aether, rather, is fictitious,On \\"historical examples of empirically successful theories that later turn out to be false\\", Okasha, Philosophy of Science (Oxford U P, 2002), p 65, concludes, \\"One that remains is the wave theory of light, first put forward by Christian Huygens in 1690. According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe. (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.) The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena. Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true. But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it. Again, we have an example of a false but empirically successful theory\\". \\"relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since\\" 1905 brought special relativity.Pigliucci, Answers for Aristotle (Basic Books, 2012), p 119: \\"But the antirealist will quickly point out that plenty of times in the past scientists have posited the existence of unobservables that were apparently necessary to explain a phenomenon, only to discover later on that such unobservables did not in fact exist. A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate. It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since. The antirealists will relish pointing out that modern physics features a number of similarly unobservable entities, from quantum mechanical 'foam' to dark energy, and that the current crop of scientists seems just as confident about the latter two as their nineteenth-century counterparts were about aether\\". Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence, simply said it superfluous. Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether,Wilczek, Lightness of Being (Basic Books, 2008), pp 78‚Äì80. and to explain motion was led back to aether in general relativity.Laughlin, A Different Universe (Basic Books, 2005), pp 120‚Äì21.Lorentz aether was at absolute rest‚Äîacting on matter but not acted on by matter. Replacing it and resembling Ernst Mach's aether, Einstein aether is spacetime itself‚Äîwhich is the gravitational field‚Äîreceiving motion from a body and transmitting it to other bodies while propagating at light speed, waving. An unobservable, however, Einstein aether is not a privileged reference frame‚Äîis not to be assigned a state of absolute motion or absolute rest. Yet resistance to relativity theoryRelativity theory comprises both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR). Holding for inertial reference frames, SR is as a limited case of GR, which holds for all reference frames, both inertial and accelerated. In GR, all motion‚Äîinertial, accelerated, or gravitational‚Äîis consequent of the geometry of 3D space stretched onto the 1D axis of time. By GR, no force distinguishes acceleration from inertia. Inertial motion is consequence simply of uniform geometry of spacetime, acceleration is consequence simply of nonuniform geometry of spacetime, and gravitation is simply acceleration. became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo. Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether,Einstein, \\"Ether\\", Sidelights (Methuen, 1922), pp 14‚Äì18. but Einstein aether, too, was opposed. Objects became conceived as pinned directly on space and timeIn Einstein's 4D spacetime, 3D space is stretched onto the 1D axis of time flow, which slows while space additionally contracts in the vicinity of mass or energy. by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.Torretti, Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge U P, 1999), p 180. By 1970, QED along with weak nuclear field was reduced to electroweak theory (EWT), and the strong nuclear field was modeled as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Comprised by EWT, QCD, and Higgs field, this Standard Model of particle physics is an \\"effective theory\\",As an effective field theory, once adjusted to particular domains, Standard Model is predictively accurate until a certain, vast energy scale that is a cutoff, whereupon more fundamental phenomena‚Äîregulating the effective theory's modeled phenomena‚Äîwould emerge. (Burgess & Moore, Standard Model, p xi; Wells, Effective Theories, pp 55‚Äì56). not truly fundamental. As QCD's particles are considered nonexistent in the everyday world, QCD especially suggests an aether, routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry.Laughlin, A Different Universe, (Basic Books, 2005), pp 120‚Äì21: \\"The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. ... Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. It turns out that such matter exists. About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo\\". Confirmation of the Higgs particle, modeled as a condensation within the Higgs field, corroborates aether, although physics need not state or even include aether. Organizing regularities of observations‚Äîas in the covering law model‚Äîphysicists find superfluous the quest to discover aether. In 1905, from special relativity, Einstein deduced mass‚Äìenergy equivalence,Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc2. particles being variant forms of distributed energy,Einstein, \\"Ether\\", Sidelights (Methuen, 1922), p 13: \\"[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy\\". how particles colliding at vast speed experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,Braibant, Giacomelli & Spurio, Particles and Fundamental Interactions (Springer, 2012), p 2: \\"Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass\\". although physicists' talk promotes confusion.Brian Greene explained, \\"People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the LHC, and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it. The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside. Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy. Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2, energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding protons. The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being\\" [Avent, \\"The Q&A;\\", Economist, 2012]. As \\"the contemporary locus of metaphysical research\\", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as excitation modes of fields,Torretti, Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge U P, 1999), p 396. the particles and their masses being states of aether,Wilczek, \\"The persistence of ether\\", Phys Today, 1999; 52:11,13, p 13. apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,Wilczek, Lightness of Being (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 \\"The grid (persistence of ether)\\", p 73: \\"For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from QCD is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.

Yet a quantum field is an intricate abstraction‚Äîa mathematical field‚Äîvirtually inconceivable as a classical field's physical properties.Kuhlmann, \\"Physicists debate\\", Sci Am, 2013. Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory. Though discovery of causality is popularly thought science's aim, search for it was shunned by the Newtonian research program, even more Newtonian than was Isaac Newton.Whereas Newton's Principia inferred absolute space and absolute time, omitted an aether, and, by Newton's law of universal gravitation, formalized action at a distance‚Äîa supposed force of gravitation spanning the entire universe instantly‚ÄîNewton's later work Optiks introduced an aether binding bodies' matter, yet denser outside bodies, and, not uniformly distributed across all space, in some locations condensed, whereby \\"aethereal spirits\\" mediate electricity, magnetism, and gravitation. (Whittaker, A History of Theories of Aether and Electricity (Longmans, Green & Co: 1910), pp 17‚Äì18) By now, most theoretical physicists infer that the four, known fundamental interactions would reduce to superstring theory, whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms. Given uncertainties of scientific realism,Challenges to scientific realism are captured succinctly by Bolotin, Approach to Aristotle's Physics (SUNY P, 1998), pp 33‚Äì34, commenting about modern science, \\"But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet. For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world. For instance, Newton's first law of motion (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one. This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events. Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in The Evolution of Physics, that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'. Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'. To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'. But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'. In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon\\". some conclude that the concept causality raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key folk science, but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.Norton, \\"Causation as folk science\\", in Price & Corry, eds, Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality (Oxford U P, 2007), esp p 12. Even epidemiology is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality. Covering law model is among Carl G Hempel's admired contributions to philosophy of science.Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, Science, Explanation, and Rationality (Oxford U P, 2000), p 111.

The movement originated in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw). They were joined for a time by somewhat more conservative dissidents under the leadership of Johannes Czerski. This latter movement took the name of Christian Catholics and originated in Schneidem√ºhl (now Pi≈Ça). Controversy over robe exposition Wilhelm Arnoldi, bishop of Trier In the 15 October 1844 issue of the S√§chsische Vaterlandsbl√§tter, Johannes Ronge, a Roman Catholic priest in Silesia, published a vigorous attack upon Wilhelm Arnoldi, bishop of Trier since 1842, for having ordered (for the first time since 1810) the exposition of the alleged seamless robe of Jesus, an event that drew countless pilgrims to the cathedral. Bishop Arnoldi had proclaimed that the artifact had healing powers, and accompanied the exhibition of the holy coat by a promise of plenary indulgence to whoever should make a pilgrimage to Trier to honor it. Ronge denounced the projected pilgrimages as idolatry. Ronge, who had formerly been chaplain at Grottkau, was then a schoolmaster at Laurah√ºtte. He had already been suspended from his charge on account of his independent views. Ronge's article made a great sensation, and led to his excommunication by the chapter of Breslau in December 1844. The ex-priest received much public sympathy, and a dissenting congregation calling itself the \\"New Catholics\\" was soon formed at Breslau. They were later forced to change their name from \\"New Catholics\\" to \\"German Catholics\\". Early growth Johannes Ronge Within less than a year, the German Catholics grew to over 8,000 members. Communities were formed at Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin, Offenbach am Main, Worms, Wiesbaden and several other locations. The movement garnered support from Robert Blum, a newspaper publisher in Leipzig. Blum published writings of the new movement and helped to organize it. Magdeburg was also prominent among the towns where congregations belonging to the new body were formed. There an instructor named Kote was a prominent worker. Even before the beginning of the agitation led by Ronge, another movement fundamentally distinct, though in some respects similar, had been originated at Schneidemuhl, Posen, under the guidance of Johannes Czerski, also a priest, who had come into collision with the church authorities on the then much discussed question of mixed marriages, and also on that of the celibacy of the clergy. The result had been his suspension from office in March 1844; his public withdrawal, along with twenty-four adherents, from the Roman communion in August; his excommunication; and the formation, in October, of a \\"Christian Catholic\\" congregation which, while rejecting clerical celibacy, the use of Latin in public worship, and the doctrines of purgatory and transubstantiation, retained the Nicene theology and the doctrine of the seven sacraments. Together Ronge and Czerski appealed to the lower grades of the clergy to unite in founding a National German Church independent of the Pope and governed by councils and synods. Leipzig council A council convened at Leipzig at Easter (March) 1845 to deliberate on the affairs of the body. Twenty-seven congregations were represented by delegates, of whom only two or at most three were in clerical orders. The council proceeded under the presidency of Professor Wigard to arrange a system of doctrine and practice which was to form the basis of union for the whole Church. The Bible was recognized as the sole standard of faith and its interpretation was left to reason, ‚Äúpenetrated and animated‚Äù by the Christian idea. Only two sacraments were admitted: baptism and the Lord's Supper. In matters of ritual, each congregation was left free to carry into practice its own views. Each congregation was to choose its own pastor and elders. Affairs of a general interest were entrusted to the management of a general council to meet every five years, but the decisions of this council were to be ratified by a majority of the congregations before they came valid. The authority of the Pope was not recognized. The constitution of the new Church was thus democratic and Protestant, but in some respects the German Catholics went even further than the majority of Protestants in a liberal direction, inasmuch as they claimed for all complete religious liberty and declared their religion to be capable of development and modification with the progress of the human mind. The confession of sins, indulgences, canonization and invocation of saints, use of the Latin language in divine service, prohibition of mixed marriages, the hierarchy of the clergy and the celibacy of the priests were abolished. Nothing was declared either for or against the subject of purgatory. Czerski was at some of the sittings of the council of Leipzig, but when a formula somewhat similar to that of Breslau had been adopted, he refused his signature because the divinity of Christ had been ignored, and he and his congregation continued to retain by preference the name of \\"Christian Catholics\\", which they had originally assumed. Beliefs German Catholics adhered to a very simple creed, in which the chief beliefs were: * God the Father, creator and ruler of the universe. * Jesus Christ the Saviour, who delivers from the bondage of sin by his life, doctrine and death. * The operation of the Holy Ghost. * A holy, universal, Christian church. * Forgiveness of sins and the life everlasting. Politics Many of the German Catholics were involved in politics. Ronge himself was a foremost figure in the troubles of 1848. In Austria, and ultimately also in Bavaria, the use of the name \\"German Catholic\\" was officially prohibited, with that of \\"dissidents\\" being substituted, while in Prussia, Baden and Saxony the adherents of the new creed were put under various disabilities, being suspected of both undermining religion and encouraging the revolutionary tendencies of the age. Later developments A second council in Leipzig, which met in May 1850, had to be transferred to K√∂then on account of the interference of the police. It proposed an alliance with the Free Congregations, which had formed themselves by secession from the Protestant churches, and the election of a joint executive committee from both denominations, which was to act as a presiding board until the meeting of a triennial diet, which was appointed for 1852, but it did not meet. In June 1859, the representatives of the German Catholics and Free Congregations met at Gotha, where a union between the two parties was effected under the name of Bund freireligi√∂ser Gemeinden (Confederation of free religious congregations). It was proposed that the confederation admit all free Protestant and even Jewish congregations. Legislation in the different states had become more tolerant, and the carrying out of the scheme of the council of Gotha seemed to be at least practicable. But the result proved otherwise. The confederation consisted of too heterogeneous elements. While some of the members receding further and further from orthodoxy proclaimed simple design as their religion and abolished baptism and the Lord's Supper, others on the contrary lost themselves in an exaggerated mysticism. Many of the congregations which were formed in 1844 and the years immediately following dissolved, including that of Schneidem√ºhl itself, which ceased to exist in 1857. The majority of the German Catholics joined the national Protestant church. As of 1911, there were only about two thousand strict German Catholics, all in Saxony. The movement was superseded by the Old Catholic Church.

Plot In the small town of Burnside, the Jerome's family house is destroyed by teenage vandals, who defecate on the floors and push their daughter down the stairs, placing her in a coma. A childlike stalker calling himself \\"The Avenger\\" witnesses the incident and, enraged, begins to track down each culprit. Characters Characters in We All Fall Down are Jane Jerome, Buddy Walker, and The Avenger. After the vandalism, the book separates into three discrete storylines: one from Jane's point of view, which reveals how she and her family feel after the trashing; one from Buddy's point of view, which reveals his problems, family, and friends; and one from the Avenger's point of view, which reveals his cruel past and plans and cares. =Jane Jerome= In the novel, Jane Jerome, 16, is one of the main characters. She goes to high school and lives with her parents, her younger sister, Karen, and her younger brother, Artie, in a small town named Burnside. After the trashing early in the novel, Jane feels bad about arguing with her sister. A lot of thoughts come to her about her relationship with Karen. The incident in the house and Karen's coma make Jane‚Äôs behaviour change. She feels less comfortable in her home. Then she goes out with Buddy Walker. She allows him to kiss her, hug her, and caress her. She thinks that when she is with Buddy everything is wonderful and her troubles go away. =Buddy Walker= Buddy Walker, 16, changes after his family has been broken into. In the beginning, he trashes the house of Jane Jerome and watches silently as Jane's sister Karen is assaulted and finally thrown down the stairs to the cellar, which results in a coma. Later on in the story, he starts noticing Jane and begins to fall for her and fills the empty hole with the love for Jane. However, while desperately trying to cope with the incident of his father moving out and him not telling Jane about the trashing, Buddy struggles to find comfort and support. For some time, it seems as though Buddy finds these things in groups of individuals, but they do not offer Walker true companionship. They instead offer him the temptation and consolation found with alcohol. =The Avenger= Mickey \\"Looney\\" or Mickey Stallings, a middle- aged man, has killed a bully at school and his grandfather. He is portrayed as 11 most of the story, until he abducts Jane Jerome. It is then revealed that Mickey committed those crimes 30 years ago and is planning to kill Jane for dating Buddy. He commits suicide at the end of the book as he is about to murder Jane. Reception Because of its frank language and adult themes, it is named one of the top 100 most challenged books from 1990 to 2000, by the American Library Association,http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.htm and has been banned from some libraries.http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/oct/30/ban_spurs_giveaway/ In 2003, it was in the top 10 most challenged books reported to the Office for Intellectual Freedom. Despite the controversy surrounding this novel, We All Fall Down received positive reviews from School Library Journal, The Horn Book Magazine, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly.Foerstel, Herbert N., and Inc ebrary.

Web. =Challenges= In 1988, a parent in Simcoe County (ON) complained to their children‚Äôs school board about We All Fall Down, because she believed the violence in the novel was inappropriate for children to read in school. The school board moved the novel from the primary schools to the high schools in that district, though the parent remained unsatisfied. In November 2000, parents in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, complained about We all Fall Down because of the violence in several scenes, as well as the description of suicide in the book. Officials in the school district created a new book selection policy in response to the parents' objections.Foerstel, Herbert N., and Inc ebrary.

In March 2000, We All Fall Down was removed from the Carver Middle School in Leesburg, Florida, because parents of a sixth-grader who was studying the book were unhappy with the language used in the novel. The father of the student, said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a book for school. It‚Äôs everything negative about society, like rape, vulgarity, alcohol abuse, murder and how to cover it up.‚Äù The principal of the middle school agreed, and the book was removed from the school library. The principal also held a faculty meeting to advise staff to look carefully at the books they are assigning to children.

Background on why the new encoding standard was developed Standard 6-dot braille only provides 63 distinct characters (not including the space character), and thus, over the years a number of distinct rule-sets have been developed to represent literary text, mathematics, scientific material, computer software, the @ symbol used in email addresses, and other varieties of written material. Different countries also used differing encodings at various times: during the 1800s American Braille competed with English Braille, in the War of the Dots. As a result of the expanding need to represent technical symbolism, and divergence during the past 100 years across countries, braille users who desired to read or write a large range of material have needed to learn different sets of rules, depending on what kind of material they were reading at a given time. Rules for a particular type of material were often not compatible from one system to the next (the rule-sets for literary/mathematical/computerized encoding-areas were sometimes conflicting‚Äîand of course differing approaches to encoding mathematics were not compatible with each other), so the reader would need to be notified as the text in a book moved from computer braille code for programming to Nemeth Code for mathematics to standard literary braille. Moreover, the braille rule-set used for math and computer science topics, and even to an extent braille for literary purposes, differed among various English-speaking countries. Overview of the goals of UEB Unified English Braille is intended to develop one set of rules, the same everywhere in the world, which could be applied across various types of English-language material. The notable exception to this unification is Music Braille, which UEB specifically does not encompass, because it is already well-standardized internationally. Unified English Braille is designed to be readily understood by people familiar with the literary braille (used in standard prose writing), while also including support for specialized math and science symbols, computer-related symbols (the @ sign as well as more specialised programming- language syntax), foreign alphabets, and visual effects (bullets, bold type, accent marks, and so on). According to the original 1991 specification for UEB, the goals were: : 1. simplify and unify the system of braille used for encoding English, reducing community-fragmentation : 2. reduce the overall number of official coding systems, which currently include: :: a. literary code (since 1933, English Braille Grade 2 has been the main component) ::: i. BANA flavor used in North America, et cetera ::: ii. BAUK flavor used in United Kingdom, etc. :: b. Textbook Formats and Techniques code :: c. math- notation and science-notation codes ::: i. Nemeth Code (since 1952, in North America and several other countries) ::: ii. modern variants of Taylor Code, a subset of literary code (since 18xx, standard elsewhere, alternative in North America) ::: iii. Extended Nemeth Code With Chemistry Module ::: iv. Extended Nemeth Code With Ancient Numeration Module ::: v. Mathematical Diagrams Module (not actually associated with any particular coding-system) :: d. Computer Braille Code (since the 1980s, for special characters) ::: i. the basic CBC ::: ii. CBC With Flowchart Module :: e. Braille Music Code (since 1829, last upgraded/unified 1997, used for vocals and instrumentals‚Äîthis one explicitly not to be unified nor eliminated) :: f. [added later] IPA Braille code (used for phonetic transcriptions‚Äîthis one did not yet exist in 1991) : 3. if possible, unify the literary-code used across English-speaking countries : 4. where it is not possible to reduce the number of coding systems, reduce conflicts :: a. most especially, rule-conflicts (which make the codes incompatible at a \\"software\\" level‚Äîin human brains and computer algorithms) :: b. symbol conflicts, for example, the characters \\"$\\", \\"%\\", \\"]\\", and \\"[\\" are all represented differently in the various code systems :: c. sometimes the official coding-systems themselves are not explicitly in conflict, but ambiguity in their rules can lead to accidental conflicts : 5. the overall goal of steps 1 to 4 above is to make acquisition of reading, writing, and teaching skill in the use of braille quicker, easier, and more efficient : 6. this in turn will help reverse the trend of steadily eroding usage of Braille itself (which is being replaced by electronics and/or illiteracy) : 7. besides those practical goals, it is also desired that braille‚Äîas a writing system‚Äîhave the properties required for long-term success: :: a. universal, with no special code-system for particular subject-matter, no special-purpose \\"modules\\", and no serious disagreements about how to encode English :: b. coherent, with no internal conflicts, and thus no need for authoritative fiat to \\"resolve\\" such conflicts by picking winners and losers :: c. ease of use, with dramatically less need for braille-coding-specific lessons, certifications, workshops, literature, etc. :: d. uniform yet extensible, with symbol-assignment giving an unvarying identity-relationship, and new symbols possible without conflicts or overhauls : 8. philosophically, an additional goal is to upgrade the braille system to be practical for employment in a workplace, not just for reading recreational and religious texts :: a. computer-friendly (braille-production on modern keyboards and braille- consumption via computerized file formats‚Äîsee also Braille e-book which did not really exist back in 1990) :: b. tech-writing-friendly (straightforward handling of notations used in math/science/medical/programming/engineering/similar) :: c. precise bidirectional representation (both #8a and #8b can be largely satisfied by a precision writing system‚Ä¶but the existing braille systems as of 1990 were not fully precise, replacing symbols with words, converting unit-systems, altering punctuation, and so on) : 9. upgrades to existing braille-codes are required, and then these modified codes can be merged into a unified code (preferably singular plus the music-code) Some goals were specially and explicitly called out as key objectives, not all of which are mentioned above: * objective#A = precise bidirectional representation of printed-text (see #8c) * objective#B = maximizing the usefulness of braille's limited formatting mechanisms in systematic fashion (so that readers can quickly and easily locate the information they are seeking) * objective#C = unifying the rule-systems and symbol-assignments for all subject-matters except musical notation, to eliminate 'unlearning' (#9 / #2 / #3) * objective#D = context-independent encoding (symbols must be transcribable in straightforward fashion‚Äîwithout regard to their English meaning) * objective#E = markup or mode-switching ability (to clearly distinguish between information from the printed version, versus transcriber commentary) * objective#F = easy-to-memorize symbol- assignments (to make learning the coding system easier‚Äîand also facilitate reading of relatively rare symbols) (see #7c / #5 / #1) * objective#G = extensible coding-system (with the possibility of introducing new symbols in a non-conflicting and systematic manner) (see #7d) * objective#H = algorithmic representation and deterministic rule-set (texts are amenable to automatic computerized translation from braille to print‚Äîand vice versa) (see #8a) * objective#I = backward compatibility with English Braille Grade 2 (someone reading regular words and sentences will hardly notice any modifications) * objective#J = reverse the steadily declining trend of braille-usage (as a statistical percentage of the blind-community), as soon as possible (see #6) Goals that were specifically _not_ part of the UEB upgrade process were the ability to handle languages outside the Roman alphabet (cf. the various national variants of ASCII in the ISO 8859 series versus the modern pan- universal Unicode standard, which governs how writing systems are encoded for computerized use). History of specification and adoption of UEB Work on UEB formally began in 1991,http://www.acb.org/magazine/2001/bf092001.html#bf06 and preliminary draft standard was published in March 1995 (as UBC),http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_ubc.html then upgraded several times thereafter. Unified English Braille (UEB) was originally known as Unified Braille Code (UBC), with the English-specific nature being implied, but later the word \\"English\\" was formally incorporated into its name‚ÄîUnified English Braille Code (UEBC)‚Äîand still more recently it has come to be called Unified English Braille (UEB). On April 2, 2004, the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) gave the go-ahead for the unification of various English braille codes. This decision was reached following 13 years of analysis, research, and debate. ICEB said that Unified English Braille was sufficiently complete for recognition as an international standard for English braille, which the seven ICEB member-countries could consider for adoption as their national code. South Africa adopted the UEB almost immediately (in May 2004). During the following year, the standard was adopted by Nigeria (February 5, 2005), Australia (May 14, 2005), and New Zealand (November 2005). On April 24, 2010, the Canadian Braille Authority (CBA) voted to adopt UEB, making Canada the fifth nation to adopt UEB officially. On October 21, 2011, the UK Association for Accessible Formats voted to adopt UEB as the preferred code in the UK. On November 2, 2012 the Braille Authority of North America (BANA) became the sixth of the seven member-countries of the ICEB to officially adopt the UEB. Controversy over math-notation in UEB The major criticism against UEB is that it fails to handle mathematics or computer science as compactly as codes designed to be optimal for those disciplines. Besides requiring more space to represent and more time to read and write, the verbosity of UEB can make learning mathematics more difficult. Nemeth Braille, officially used in the United States since 1952, and as of 2002 the de facto standardhttp://www.ams.org/notices/200210/comm-morin.pdf for teaching and doing mathematics in braille in the US, was specifically invented to correct the cumbersomeness of doing mathematics in braille. However, although the Nemeth encoding standard was officially adopted by the JUTC of the US and the UK in the 1950s, in practice only the USA switched their mathematical braille to the Nemeth system, whereas the UK continued to use the traditional Henry Martyn Taylor coding (not to be confused with Hudson Taylor who was involved with the use of Moon Type for the blind in China during the 1800s) for their braille mathematics. Programmers in the United States who write their programming codefiles in braille‚Äîas opposed to in ASCII text with use of a screenreader for example‚Äîtend to use Nemeth-syntax numerals, whereas programmers in the UK use yet another system (not Taylor-numerals and not literary-numerals).http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_seb.html The key difference of Nemeth Braille compared to Taylor (and UEB which uses an upgraded version of the Taylor encoding for math) is that Nemeth uses \\"down-shifted\\" numerals from the fifth decade of the Braille alphabet (overwriting various punctuation characters), whereas UEB/Taylor uses the traditional 1800s approach with \\"up- shifted\\" numerals from the first decade of the (English) Braille alphabet (overwriting the first ten letters, namely ABCDEFGHIJ). Traditional 1800s Braille, and also UEB, require insertion of numeral-prefixes when speaking of numerals, which makes representing some mathematical equations 42% more verbose. As an alternative to UEB, there were proposals in 2001 and 2009, and most recently these were the subject of various technical workshops during 2012. Although UEB adopts some features of Nemeth, the final version of UEB mandates up-shifted numerals, which are the heart of the controversy. According to BANA, which adopted UEB in 2012, the official braille codes for the USA will be UEB and Nemeth Braille (as well as Music Braille for vocals and instrumentals plus IPA Braille for phonetic linguistics), despite the use of contradictory representation of numerals and arithmetical symbols in the UEB and Nemeth encodings. Thus, although UEB has officially been adopted in most English-speaking ICEB member-countries, in the USA (and possibly the UK where UEB is only the \\"preferred\\" system) the new encoding is not to be the sole encoding. Another proposed braille-notation for encoding math is GS8/GS6, which was specifically invented in the early 1990s as an attempt to get rid of the \\"up-shifted\\" numerals used in UEB‚Äîsee Gardner‚ÄìSalinas Braille. GS6 implements \\"extra-dot\\" numeralshttp://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs_numbers.html from the fourth decade of the English Braille alphabet (overwriting various two-letter ligatures). GS8 expands the braille-cell from 2√ó3 dots to 2√ó4 dots, quadrupling the available codepoints from the traditional 64 up to 256, but in GS8 the numerals are still represented in the same way as in GS6 (albeit with a couple unused dot-positions at the bottom).Gardner‚ÄìSalinas Braille#Digits Attempts to give the numerals their own distinct position in Braille are not new: the original 1829 specification by Louis Braille gave the numerals their own distinct symbols, with the modern digraph-based literary-braille approach mentioned as an optional fallback. However, after trying the system out in the classroom, the dashes used in the numerals‚Äîas well as several other rows of special characters‚Äîwere found to be too difficult to distinguish from dot- pairs, and thus the typical digraph-based numerals became the official standard in 1837. Implementation of UEB in English-speaking countries As of 2013, with the majority of English-speaking ICEB member-countries having officially adopted UEB, there remain barriers to implementation and deployment. Besides ICEB member-nations, there are also many other countries with blind citizens that teach and use English: India, Hong Kong/China, Pakistan, the Philippines, and so on. Many of these countries use non-UEB math notation, for English-speaking countries specifically, versions of the Nemeth Code were widespread by 1990 (in the United States, Western Samoa, Canada including Quebec, New Zealand, Israel, Greece, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Lebanon) in contrast to the similar-to-UEB-but-not-identical Taylor notation in 1990 (used by the UK, Ireland, Australia, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Jordan, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Singapore, and Zimbabwe). Some countries in the Middle East used Nemeth and Taylor math-notations as of 1990, i.e. Iran and Saudi Arabia. As of 2013, it is unclear whether the English-using blind populations of various ICEB and non-ICEB nations will move to adopt the UEB, and if so, at what rate. Beyond official adoption rates in schools and by individuals, there are other difficulties. The vast majority of existing Braille materials, both printed and electronic, are in non-UEB encodings. Furthermore, other technologies that compete with braille are now ever-more-widely affordable (screen readers for electronic-text-to-speech, plus physical-pages-to-electronic-text software combined with high-resolution digital cameras and high-speed document scanners, and the increasing ubiquity of tablets/smartphones/PDAs/PCs). The percentage of blind children who are literate in braille is already declining‚Äîand even those who know some system tend not to know UEB, since that system is still very new. Still, as of 2012 many of the original goals for UEB have already been fully or partially accomplished: * A unified literary code across most English-speaking countries (see separate section of this article on the adoption of UEB) * Number of coding-subsystems reduced from five major and one minor (banaLiterary/baukLiteraryAndTaylor/textbook/nemeth/cbc + music/etc.) down to two major and two minor (uebLiterary/nemeth using formal codeswitching \\\\+ music/ipa), plus the generality of the basic uebLiterary was increased to fully cover parentheses, math-symbols, emails, and websites. * Reasonable level of backward compatibility with the American style of English Braille (more time is required before the exact level of transitional pain can be pinpointed, but studies in Australia and the UK indicate that braille users in the United States will also likely cope quite easily) * Making braille more computer-friendly, especially in terms of translation and backtranslation of the encoding system * Fully extensible encoding system, where new symbols can be added without causing conflicts or requiring coding-overhauls Not all the symbol-duplications were eliminated (there are still at least two representations of the $ symbol for instanceContrast page 12 definition versus page 13 example and compare with page 236 which follows the second style). Since there are still two major coding-systems for math-notation and other technical or scientific writing (Nemeth as an option in the United States versus the Taylor-style math-notation recently added to uebLiterary that will likely be used in other countries), some rule conflicts remain, and braille users will be required to \\"unlearn\\" certain rules when switching. In the long run, whether these accomplishments will translate into broader goals, of reducing community fragmentation among English-speaking braille users, boosting the acquisition speed of reading/writing/teaching skill in the use of braille, and thereby preserving braille's status as a useful writing-system for the blind, as of 2013 remains to be seen.

The stave church was originally constructed just after the year 1168,Official dating by Riksantikvaren Directorate of Cultural Heritage in Norway which is known through dendrochronological dating of the ore-pine used in the construction. The logs were not completely dry when the construction took place.  Construction history  An archeological excavation that took place during 1978Uvdal stavkirke Riksantikvaren under the guidance of H. Christie and J. H. Jensenius showed that the church was built on the remains of a previous church. It is thought to have been made with the use of embedded corner column technology at the beginning of the 11th century. Churches made during the 12th century were usually very small, often no more than 40 square meters, and were therefore often expanded, even during the Middle Ages and certainly just before and after the Reformation, which took place during 1537 in Norway. The nave of the church was first expanded to the west during the Middle Ages, when the original apse of the chancel was also removed and the chancel itself elongated. Again, during that period, an extra center column was added. The chancel was torn down again in 1684, when a new and wider chancel was made, with the same width as the nave. Then, during the period 1721‚Äì1723, the church was made into a cruciform. A new ridge turret had to be made, to fit the new shape. Later, in 1819, a new vestry was added to the north wall of the chancel. = Exterior = The exterior walls were paneled in 1760. =Interior= Benches with ornately decorated sidewalls were added to the nave in 1624. The oldest part of the interior was probably richly ornately decorated by painting during 1656, the expansions during 1684 and 1723. Two scary halfmasks are quite visible on the poles of the chancel, and according to myth they were able to capture demons.  Miscellaneous  The church survives today as museum piece, owned by Fortidsminneforeningen, which also happens to own several other stave churches that survive. The church was taken out of use in 1893, but services still take place during the summer season. As of June 2016, photographing of the highly decorated interior (even with flash) was allowed. In the late nineties the local internet site Numedalsnett was allowed to shoot a short interior video with minimum equipment and lightning. The video clip is available on YouTube.

It was the site of one of the fiercest battles of the Six-Day War. Ammunition Hill is now a national memorial site.The Mysteries of Jerusalem, Ammunition Hill Museum, 2007, Jerusalem, p.120-121 Historical background Ammunition Hill was located west of a police academy, with a fortified trench connecting them. The site was built by the British during their Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s, and was used to store the police academy's ammunition. The Jordanian Arab Legion seized control of the hill during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, severing the link between Mount Scopus and West Jerusalem. In the wake of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, parts of Mount Scopus remained an Israeli enclave in Jordanian-held territory, with the Jordanians blocking access to Hadassah Medical Center and the campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on the hilltop. The post consisted of tens of bunkers built along the three main trench systems surrounding the hill, with fortified gun emplacements covering each trench. The living quarters for the Jordanian defenders of the hill were in a large underground bunker. At the time of the Six-Day War, the post was defended by a reinforced Jordanian company of 150 soldiers of the El-Hussein regiment (number 2). The battle Bunkers and trenches on Ammunition Hill A decision was taken by the Israeli Jerusalem Command, under General Uzi Narkis, to forgo an aerial attack on the hill due to its proximity to civilian areas. Instead an artillery barrage was to be focused on the police post, followed by a ground attack using an enlarged paratroop company. The size of the Israeli assault force was based on incorrect intelligence, which detailed the hill as being defended by a single platoon. When the ground assault began, the police academy was discovered to be empty of Jordanian troops, as they had taken shelter from the barrage in the bunker system of the hill, thereby enlarging the force defending the hill to one equal in size to the assault force rather than 1/3 of its size, as had been anticipated by Israeli Central Command. The fighting at the police academy and Ammunition Hill began on June 6, 1967, at 2:30 AM. The task of capturing the hill was given to the Israeli 3rd Company of the 66th Battalion, of the 55th Paratroopers Brigade, and during the battle, a force of the 2nd Company joined the fighting. The battle ended at 6:30 AM, although Israeli troops remained in the trenches due to sniper fire from Givat HaMivtar until the Harel Brigade overran that outpost in the afternoon. Thirty-six Israeli soldiers and 71 Jordanians were killed in the fighting. Ten of the soldiers who fought in this battle were given citations by the Israeli Chief of General Staff. The commander of the Paratroopers Brigade was Mordechai Gur. The commander of the 66th Battalion was . Memorial site Sign for Ammunition Hill museum The water tower In 1975, a memorial site and museum were inaugurated on the hill, preserving a part of the old post and opening a museum in the bunker. In addition, 182 olive trees were planted on the hill, commemorating the 182 Israeli soldiers who fell in the battle for Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. In 1987, the site was declared a national memorial site. The main ceremony on Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day) is held here. An estimated 200,000 visitors tour the site each year, including 80,000 soldiers. Ammunition Hill is also the main induction center for IDF paratroopers. In popular culture The song Ammunition Hill (Hebrew: ◊í◊ë◊¢◊™ ◊î◊™◊ó◊û◊ï◊©◊™ Givat Hatachmoshet), by Israeli song writer Yoram Taharlev, is one of many which struck a chord with the public due to its authentic description of the experience of the battle.

History University Hills is in the eastern San Rafael Hills. They were part of the Pre-columbian homeland of the Tongva Indians for thousands of years, and they named this area Otsunga (place of roses). It is the former site of one of California's 36 original adobes, built in 1776 by Franciscan missionaries, and destroyed by a fire in 1908. The area was part of the 1831 Mexican land grant of Rancho Rosa Castilla, given to Juan Ballesteros by Alta California Governor Manuel Victoria. It was named for the abundant amount of native Wood roses (Rosa californica) along the creek.J. N.

Characters Box Office Poison features a wide array of major, supporting, and minor characters from many walks of life. =Lead characters=Sherman Davies, a bookstore clerk. His hatred of his job is never quite enough to get him to quit. *Ed Velasquez: Sherman's friend, who laments never having had a girlfriend for the better part of the series. Ed has aspirations of being a major cartoonist, which are hampered by the various twists and turns of the industry.

The Tulane Hullabaloo is also self-funded by selling advertisements to business owners and other organizations on the self- serve advertising platform. It is published every Thursday of the academic year, except holidays, and has received multiple Pacemaker Awards, the highest award in college journalism.  History  The Tulane Weekly began in 1905 to rival The Olive and Blue, another Tulane newspaper that dates back to 1896. (There were more Tulane newsletters and newspapers before The Olive and Blue named College Spirit, Collegian, Topics and The Rat.) The first issue of The Tulane Weekly was published on November 8, 1905 and stated that \\"the organization of this paper is the result of a dispute between the student body and a few individuals at The Olive and Blue. If a few students have a right to publish a periodical under the name of the University, and represent it as a student publication when the students have no voice in its management; then this paper has no right to an existence.\\" There is no record of The Olive and Blue after 1906. The Tulane Weekly changed its name to The Hullabaloo on January 16, 1920. A staff editorial titled \\"Note: Please Send Your Dollars to The Hullabaloo\\" appeared in the first issue and stated \\"The staff favors the new name because it is representative of Tulane and is original above all else.\\" The paper still retains this name. Tulane University's mascot and nickname, the Green Wave, owes its origins to a song published in The Hullabaloo in October 1920. The paper's editor at the time, Earl Sparling, wrote and published a football song called \\"The Rolling Green Wave\\" in support of the \\"Olive and Blue\\" (as the team was officially known at the time). Within a month, The Hullabaloo started referring to the university's teams by the new nickname, a practice that was soon picked up by the daily press.

It has grown up around the Abbey of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata, founded in 1004. Nearby communes include Frascati, Rocca di Papa, Marino and Rome. History The history of Grottaferrata identifies largely with that of the Basilian Monastery of Santa Maria, founded here in 1004 by Saint Nilus the Younger. The founding legend narrates that, at the spot where the abbey now stands, the Virgin Mary appeared and bade him found a church in her honour. From Gregory, the powerful Count of Tusculum, father of Popes Benedict VIII and John XIX, Nilus obtained the site, which had been a Roman villa, where among the ruins there remained a low edifice of opus quadratum that had been a sepulchral monument but had been converted to a Christian oratory in the fourth century. Its iron window grates gave the site the name, first of Cryptoferrata then of Grottaferrata, commemorated in the coat-of-arms of the commune. From the site, a Roman bronze of a man and a cow attracted the antiquarian attention of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who had the group removed to Lucera.Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:12. Nilus died soon afterwards (26 December 1005) in the Sant' Agata monastery in Tusculum. The monastic building was carried out by his successors, especially the fourth abbot, Saint Bartholomew, who is usually considered the second founder. Building materials scavenged from the ruined villa were incorporated into the new structure, marble columns, sections of carved cornice, and blocks of the volcanic stone called peperino. The sanctuary was complete enough in 1024 to be consecrated by the Tusculan Pope John XIX. The high repute of the monks attracted many gifts; eleventh- and thirteenth-century mosaics remain, but of the ambitious ensemble of Cosmatesque inlay, only the polychrome stone paving remains. The abbey's possessions in lands were numerous and widespread, and in 1131 King Roger II of Sicily made the abbot Baron of Rossano with an extensive fief. Between the 12th and 15th centuries the monastery suffered from the continual strife of warring factions: Romans and Tusculans, Guelphs and Ghibellines, popes and antipopes, Colonna and Orsini. From 1163 till the destruction of Tusculum in 1191, the greater part of the monastic community sought refuge in a dependency of the abbey, the Benedictine protocaenobium of Subiaco. In the middle of the 13th century the Emperor Frederick II made the abbey his headquarters during the siege of Rome, while in 1378 Breton and Gascon mercenaries held it for the antipope Clement VII. The fifteenth century saw the bloody feuds of the Colonna and the Orsini raging round the walls. According to the humanist Ambrogio Traversari, in 1432 the appearance of the abbey was that of a barracks rather than a monastery. In 1462 began a line of non-resident abbots in commendam, fifteen in number, of whom all but one were cardinals. The most distinguished were the Greek Bessarion, Giulio della Rovere (afterwards Julius II), and the last of the line, Cardinal Consalvi, secretary of state to Pius VII. Cardinal Bessarion, himself a Basilian monk, increased the scanty and impoverished community and restored the church. Cardinal Giulio della Rovere, for more selfish motives, erected the castle and surrounded the whole monastery with the imposing fortifications that still exist. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese replaced the ceiling. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned by Cardinal Francesco Barberini to provide the high altar, completed in 1665. Till 1608 the community was ruled by priors dependent on abbots in commendam, but in that year Grottaferrata became a member of the Basilian congregation founded by Gregory XIII. The revenues of the community were separated from those of the commendatory abbots, and the first of a series of triennially appointed regular abbots was appointed. The triennial system survived the suppression of the commendam and lasted till the end of the nineteenth century, with one break from 1834 to 1870, when priors were appointed by the Holy See. In 1901, new constitutions came into force and Arsenio Pellegrini was installed as the first perpetual regular abbot since 1462. The Greek Rite which was brought to Grottaferrata by St. Nilus had lost its native character by the end of the twelfth century, but was restored by order of Leo XIII in 1881. The Basilian abbey has always been a home of Greek learning, and Greek hymnography flourished there long after the art had died out within the Byzantine Empire. Monastic studies were revived under Cardinal Bessarion and again in 1608. On 11 August 1901 the first electricity reached Grottaferrata from the hydroelectric plant in S. Bartholomew fall. In 1937, the monastery was made a territorial abbacy of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. Main sights Facade of the abbey church Cappella Farnese The has several courts, which lead to the famous portico designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, with an arcade of nine bays supported by slender columns with Renaissance capitals. Of the abbey church consecrated by John XIX in 1024, little can be seen in the interior except the mosaics in the narthex and over the triumphal arch, the medieval structures having been covered or destroyed during the \\"restorations\\" of various abbots in commendam. Some fragmentary thirteenth- century frescoes were revealed in a partial restoration of the church in 1904 to commemorate its novecentennial, when it was made a Roman basilica. The mosaics portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. Domenichino's frescoes, commissioned by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in 1608, can be seen in the chapel of St. Nilus. Annibale Carracci executed the altarpiece of the Madonna with Child with St. Nilus and St. Bartholomew. The modern portico protects the ancient fa√ßade; the marble portal with a mosaic above it, an example of Italo-Byzantine art of the twelfth century. In the interior is a baptismal font supported on winged lions, of the tenth or eleventh centuries. Noteworthy also is the Romanesque campanile (twelfth century), with five storeys of tripartite arched windows. The library of the Abbey, which contains some 50,000 volumes, has a paper conservation Laboratorio di Restauro, which was entrusted with the conservation of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana; the library houses writings of St. Nilus and his pupils and a rare copy of Alvise Cadamosto's collected travel accounts, printed in the early sixteenth century.

This style has come to be known as Nummedals-type. Decoration are from different periods. Nore is decorated with tendril and animal carvings. Animal characters featured include dragons and lions. The church has a central mast, that was originally the support for a tower, mostly likely containing church bells. The walls and ceiling of the interior are decorated with murals, among them scenes from the Bible presented as riddles. The church has been remodeled several times, with many original parts are preserved. The church was partly rebuilt in the 1600s and 1700s. The chancel was replaced in 1683 and the spokes of the nave in the first half of 18th century. The church received a new roof in 1730. Comprehensive repair was carried out in 1927. In 1888, art historian, professor of art history and author, Lorentz Dietrichson (1834‚Äì1917), became the owner of the church. Professor Dietrichson, who had played a major role in founding the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments (Fortidsminneforeningen), donated the property to the society in 1890.

It is located in the village of R√∏ldal. It is the church for the R√∏ldal parish which is part of the Hardanger og Voss prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The brown, wooden stave church was built in around the year 1250 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 130 people and is built in a long church style. The church is a preserved historic museum, but it is still a regularly-used parish church that holds regularly scheduled worship services twice a month. History The estimated construction date of the Church is generally suggested to be between 1200 and 1250. A baptismal font in the church is dated to the same period. A crucifix in the church dates from about 1250. The altarpiece dates to 1629. It was the design of German born painter Gottfried Hendtzschel from Breslau in Silesia. The Church has a rectangular- shaped nave and chancel. The baptismal font is of soapstone and dated 1200-1300 century. The Bergen Museum holds a variety of building components and other artifacts from the medieval church. These include altar frontal and wooden sculptures of St. Olaf from about 1250, of the Virgin Mary with child from about 1250, and the Archangel Michael, dated about 1200. In the Middle Ages, R√∏ldal Church received large donations from many of pilgrims who flocked to the church. As a result, the small village where the church is located, became quite prosperous. In the 17th century the walls inside the church were richly decorated with paintings. During reconstruction of the church in 1844, some of the history of the church was uncovered. This led to an investigation to determine how the church was built. The resulting belief is that R√∏ldal Stave Church was quite different from other stave churches. Some controversy developed about whether this is in fact a stave church or rather an example of the assumed predecessor type, a post church. From 1913 to 1918, the church underwent an extensive renovation and restoration. Paneling from the 19th century was removed and the Renaissance interior was restored. A new gallery was also built around the church to protect the wall tables. The church reconstruction was led by Norwegian architect Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland (1866‚Äì1926), and the color restoration was performed by Norwegian painter Domenico Erdmann (1879‚Äì1940), who was assisted by Norwegian painter Alfred Obert Hagn (1882‚Äì1958), and Danish-Norwegian artist Ulrik Hendriksen (1891‚Äì1960).

Washburn served several terms in the United States House of Representatives (1863‚Äì71) and as the 28th Governor of Massachusetts from 1872 to 1874, when he won election to the United States Senate in a special election to succeed the recently deceased Charles Sumner. A moderate Republican, Washburn only partially supported the Radical Republican agenda during the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed. A Yale graduate, Washburn parlayed early business success in furniture manufacture into banking and railroads, based in the Connecticut River valley town of Greenfield. He was a major proponent of railroads in northern and western Massachusetts, sitting on the board of the Connecticut River Railroad for many years, and playing an oversight role in the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel. He has been described as a latter-day \\"Connecticut River God\\" because of his role as a leading regional businessman and politician. Early life William Barrett Washburn was born on January 31, 1820 in Winchendon, Massachusetts, to Asa and Phoebe (Whitney) Washburn. His father was a hat maker from a family with deep colonial roots; Emory Washburn, who was Governor of Massachusetts in 1854, was a distant cousin. Asa Washburn died in 1823.Williams, pp. 34‚Äì35 Washburn was educated in the academies at Hancock and Westminster, and then attended Yale College, graduating in 1844.Williams, p. 35 He was a member of the Skull and Bones Society.Millegan, pp. 597‚Äì690. \\"This list is compiled from material from the Order of Skull and Bones membership books at Sterling Library, Yale University and other public records.

He established a chair factory in Erving, operating it from 1847 to 1857 and parlaying a $10,000 ($ in dollars) investment into a wood products business whose annual production exceeded $150,000 ($). In 1849 he cofounded the Franklin County Trust Company, on whose board he sat until 1858.Lockwood, p. 664 He moved to Greenfield in 1857, where he was elected president of the Greenfield Bank (later the First National Bank), a post he would hold for the rest of his life.McGee, p. 866 In 1847, Washburn married Hannah Sweetser of Athol; the couple had six children,Hurd, p. 1068 with four surviving to adulthood.Giddings, p. 503 Political career Washburn won election to the Massachusetts Senate in 1850 and served two years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1853 to 1855.Tager and Herman, p. 40 His elections to the state legislature were supported by proponents of the Hoosac Tunnel. In 1862 Washburn ran for Congress as a Republican, winning election to the 38th Congress against no opposition. He was reelected four times, winning each time by wide margins.Clay, pp. 35‚Äì36 He was viewed as relatively moderate, in comparison to the mostly Radical Republican Massachusetts delegation.Baum (1984), p. 244 He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims during the 41st Congress. In 1871, Washburn ran for Governor of Massachusetts. The Republican Party was then dominant in state politics,Hart, pp. 4:588‚Äì589 and a number of well-known politicians vied for the party nomination to replace outgoing Governor William Claflin. Most prominent was the former Congressman and American Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler, who was disliked by the fiscally conservative state Republican establishment over his support for the continued issuance of greenbacks (currency not backed by silver or gold),West, pp. 349‚Äì350 and who frequently used populist tactics to upset convention proceedings. Butler's opponents eventually united behind Washburn to give him the nomination, and he won the general election by a 13,000 vote margin over John Quincy Adams II and a labor candidate.Austin, pp. 543‚Äì545 He was reelected to further terms in 1872 and 1873, the former despite dissension in Republican ranks that had resulted in the splitting off of the Liberal Republican Party, who fielded Francis W. Bird.Austin, pp. 547‚Äì548 The 1873 convention was particularly affected by the actions of Butler supporters, but Washburn prevailed and was again comfortably reelected.Austin, pp. 552‚Äì553 Washburn's three victories over Butler in these conventions marked a low point in the latter's career.West, pp. 350‚Äì351 The major event of 1872 during Washburn's tenure as governor was the Great Boston Fire of 1872, which destroyed of prime commercial real estate in the city on November 9. The legislature was called into a special session to enable the provision of state assistance. Measures it passed included a bill simplifying the establishment of insurance companies, since several were bankrupted by the blaze, and a bill authorizing the city to issue bonds to speed the rebuilding effort.Austin, pp. 545‚Äì549 1873 brought a new round of state funding in the amount of $200,000 to fund the final completion of the Hoosac Tunnel, a tightening of the state's alcohol prohibition laws, and the establishments of a new prison in Concord (now MCI Concord) and a mental hospital in Salem.Austin, pp. 550‚Äì552 In 1874, Washburn signed legislation establishing a women's reformatory.Mohr, p. 6 Although Washburn was a supporter of women's suffrage, the matter was not seriously considered by the legislature during his term.Baum (1983), pp. 69‚Äì70 He also supported legislation reforming the state's child labor and education laws, which were widely flouted.Mohr, p. 13 He opposed enactment of a labor bill limiting work to ten hours per day, a subject of regular labor agitation during his tenure.Blewett, p. 133 When United States Senator Charles Sumner died in March 1874, the state senate, which then chose the state's US senators, met to choose his replacement. After a long and contentious debate involving thirty-three ballots,Roe, p. 659 Washburn was chosen to succeed Sumner as a compromise candidate acceptable to supporters of Henry L. Dawes and George F. Hoar. Washburn then resigned the governorship, leaving Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot as Acting Governor.Austin, p. 554 Washburn served from April 17, 1874 until the term ended on March 3, 1875, and refused to run for reelection. Other activities Not long after leaving the governorship, Washburn was appointed to a state commission established to investigate the finances and operations of the Hoosac Tunnel, whose construction, originally estimated at $2 million ($), had instead cost over $14 million ($) and the financing and involvement of the state to complete.Schiffler, p. 131 This commission filed its report with the legislature in 1875.Austin, p. 557 Washburn served at various times as a trustee of Yale, the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst), Amherst College, and Smith College,History of the Connecticut Valley in Massachusetts, p. 585 whose Washburn House he funded. Harvard University conferred a law degree upon him in 1872.

He served as a Minister in the illegal revolutionary government of the Bavarian Soviet Republic and subsequently in the People's State of Bavaria administration, 1919-20. Biography Born in Ilbesheim, near Landau, Palatinate, his parents were Peter Hoffmann and Maria Eva, n√©e Keller. He attended the Gymnasium in Landau, and, having completed his studies at the teaching seminary, served as a school teacher in Kaiserslautern from 1887. He married Luise Ackermann in 1892. Between 1899 and 1904, Hoffmann was a member of the Kaiserslautern city council, seconded by the liberal German People's Party (DVP). In 1907, he joined the Social Democrats and was elected deputy of the Bavarian Landtag the next year; his candidacy earned him disciplinary proceedings and he finally had to quit public service. In 1910 he returned into the Kaiserslautern city council and from 1912 he held the position of second mayor. In the same year, he was elected to the German Reichstag parliament. After the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 and the establishment of the People's State of Bavaria, he served as Bavarian Minister of Education under Minister-President Kurt Eisner. During his tenure as Minister of Education, he removed the Bavarian schooling system from the supervision of the Catholic Church. After Eisner's assassination he succeeded him as minister-president of the People's State of Bavaria on 17 March 1919 as the first freely elected Bavarian Minister President. Ousted from Munich by the forces of the Bavarian Soviet Republic and the local worker's council led by Hoffmann's former party fellow Ernst Niekisch, the parliament and government evaded to Bamberg in April 1919, where Hoffmann took part in the working out of the Bavarian Constitution (\\"Bamberg Constitution\\"). After his government had Munich occupied by Reichswehr troops and paramilitary Freikorps units, Hoffmann and his cabinet were able to return in May 1919. However, on 14 March 1920, Hoffmann resigned and was succeeded by Gustav von Kahr,Bayern (Bavaria) - Minister-presidents after he was forced out of office by the Bavarian Civil Guards and Freikorps forces.Diehl, James M. Paramilitary Politics in Weimar Germany. Indiana University Press, 1977. Pg.72-74. Hoffmann returned to Kaiserslautern. After standing unsuccessfully for Mayor of Ludwigshafen, he again tried to pursue his teaching career. Nevertheless, he was dismissed on charges of collaboration during the Allied occupation of the Rhineland. At least, Hoffmann retained his Reichstag mandate until his death in 1930. All pension claims raised by his widow were denied by the Bavarian government.

The action takes place in a rural Irish village as well as in London in the 1950s. It is notable as the last of Binchy's novels to be set in the 1950s. Binchy explores the roles of women in Irish society and inconstant lovers, and uses an operatic plot to hold the reader's attention. Plot Helen McMahon disappears when her daughter Kit is 12 years old, and it is suspected that she drowned in the local lake. Kit finds a letter from her mother and burns it before reading it, fearing that a suicide note will prevent her from meriting a church burial. In fact, Helen has left her kindly but unexciting husband Martin and two children to run off to London to be with her dashing lover, and left the note to let them know that she would like to keep in touch with her children as they grow up. Kit struggles to grow up without her mother and with the stigma of her mother's death. While Kit has many friends and mentors to help her grow, she forges a close relationship via a pen pal relationship with a woman named Lena Gray, who claims to have been a close friend of Helen. The story then traces the fallout of Kit finding out that her mother is not dead and is in fact Lena Gray. Other characters in the novel who play significant roles in Kit's life are her on-again, off-again friend Clio Kelly, the doting Philip O'Brien who has wanted to marry her all his life, Stevie Sullivan who owns the car garage across the street, and Sister Madeleine, a reclusive older woman who shares everyone's confidences. Themes Like Tara Road, in which Binchy introduces an American character to an Irish town, The Glass Lake offers readers a look at the lives of women in another country ‚Äì namely, England, to which Lena escapes with her lover. This plot device plays up the \\"Irishness\\" of the other protagonists and reinforces the self-identity of Binchy's Irish women readers. Priests, brothers, and nuns are all featured in this and other early works by Binchy. In The Glass Lake, Bincy creates the character of Sister Madeleine, an all-knowing, tolerant, and giving woman who lives as a hermit on the edge of town. Binchy's husband, Gordon Snell, asked her to \\"tone down\\" Sister Madeleine's goodness after reading the first draft and finding the character \\"too soppy\\" and \\"too sentimental\\". However, \\"she remains the most wholly admirable person in the story\\". Reception The Detroit Free Press notes that The Glass Lake differs from previous Binchy titles in being plot-driven rather than character-based. This review, which gave the book 2¬Ω out of 4 stars, called the overlay of \\"mystery and tragedy swirling around the main character\\" unsettling, and accused Binchy of \\"in some cases neglect[ing] the credibility of her characters\\" in favor of the plot. The Star Tribune, in contrast, felt the major characters were credible but reflected a strong gender bias: > Binchy's women, once again, tend to be the \\"good guys.\\" They are capable and > loving, ambitious and intelligent. They are disappointed in their > relationships with men. Male characters, the \\"bad guys\\", lack motivation, > discipline and commitment. They are, more often than not, the source of the > women's problems. This review suggests that the gender bias could be traced to Binchy's upbringing in Ireland's male-dominated society, and her coming-of-age during the women's liberation movement. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel praised Binchy for writing \\"strong and realistic female characters\\" who possess an inner fortitude to survive the ups and downs of daily life. The Quad-City Times also lauded Binchy's eye and ear for describing the people, conversations, and settings of Ireland of the 1950s. As of 1998, The Glass Lake was Ireland's best-selling book of all time. Adaptations The Glass Lake was produced on an abridged audiobook with a running time of six hours.

Andimeshk is located about north of Shush, on the main road and the rail line between Tehran and Ahvaz. The name first appears in cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia from the Ur III period (21st to 20th century BCE) in the form \\"Adamshakh\\", with a probable meaning \\"Crocodile (Town)\\". Later it was called \\"Andamaska\\" or \\"Andimaska\\", meaning \\"plenty of butter\\"; local villages like Gheel-AB and Lour and two fortresses were added to it.Iranica The city was en route to Ilam and Anshan and subsequently to Lorestan, which made it strategically important until the late Sassanid era. History During the Pahlavi dynasty era, Andimeshk received a great deal of modern development projects because of its location and resources. These included a railway, the Dokoohe military depot and an aluminum factory-silo, as well as many other industrial developments. The city had been connected along the Trans-Iranian Railway in 1929. During World War II a pipeline was also laid from Abadan, then the location of the world's largest refinery, to Andimeshk; from there the fuel was re-loaded onto trucks and transported to the Soviet Union. In 1955 the pipeline was extended from Andimeshk to Tehran. Encyclopaedia Iranica According to Tarikh-e-Tabari most of the people in this city are of Khuzi origin. Archaeology North Khuzestan was home to some of the oldest civilizations in the world. The Choghamish hills have more than 8,000 years of treasures from different periods, and archaeologists have called on the city of dawn. Susa's Zanbil temple symbolizes the knowledge of the people who lived in this area over 3,000 years ago. Apadana palace is a symbol of the greatness of the Iranians.

Karkheh Dam This dam was a mistake and an environmental crime among many other so called dams that IRGC made.[very biased and poor wording, should be removed] the information is ambiguous as after revolution no American stayed or worked in Iran. The dam is not 127 m high rather 48 m and River Dez has the dam with 127m high and build by American multinational company. The karkhe dam damaged wild life down stream up to Shoush some 30 km south.[Please remove the false info down here!] The dam is on the Karkheh River in the north-western province of Khuzestan, the closest city being Andimeshk to the east. It is 127 metres high and has a reservoir capacity of 5.9 billion cubic meters. The Karkheh Dam is designed to irrigate 320,000 hectares of land, produce 520 MW of hydro-electricity and prevent downstream floods. In 1956, studies began on the Karkheh Dam by the American company Development and Resources Corporation, which was headed by David E. Lilienthal, the former Chairman of the TVA. In 1990, the final studies were completed by Mahab Ghods Consulting Engineers. The engineering division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) started construction on the Karkheh Dam in 1992 and the dam was complete in 2001. During construction, 120 contractual and over eight consultative companies worked on the dam. 5,000 workers constructed the dam and 40 died in the process.http://www.industcards.com/hydro-iran.htm Hydroelectric Power Plants in Iran It is also possible to visit the powerhouse which is located at the east side of the dam in the mountains. The powerhouse has eight vertical Francis turbines. The dam's current problem is the annual loss of reservoir capacity due to the erosion of soil in upstream areas. Geography Andimeshk sits close to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains on the main north-south highway from Tehran to Ahvaz, the provincial capital of Khuzestan. The main rail line from Tehran to the Persian Gulf is 15 km (9 mi) from Andimeshk.. Persian Gulf is at least 200 km south. Climate Andimeshk has a hot semi- arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh) with extremely hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is higher than most of southern Iran, but is almost exclusively confined to the period from November to April, though on occasions it can exceed per month or per year.Andimeshk rainfall Economy Andimeshk Because Railway Station is the primary commercial center for northern Khuzestan and one of the main producers of agricultural products in Iran .

The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the United States, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on personal / personally, and identifiable / identifying. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the General Data Protection Regulation, the term \\"personal data\\" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime. National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-122 defines personally identifiable information as \\"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\\" So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.Section 3.3.3 \\"Identifiability\\" However, in the European Union, the IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classed as personal data. Personal data is defined under the GDPR as \\"any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person\\". The concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII, and lawmakers such as the European Parliament have enacted a series of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII. Important confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII identifies them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non- prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, \\"PII\\" is typically deprecated internationally.  Conceptions  The U.S. government used the term \\"personally identifiable\\" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22) and that usage now appears in US standards such as the NIST Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (SP 800-122). The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows: A term similar to PII, \\"personal data\\" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive: However, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes‚Äîquasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In the GDPR Personal Data is defined as: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person Another term similar to PII, \\"personal information\\" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386: The concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from \\"personal information\\", as defined by SB1386. Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 \\"personal information\\", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name John Smith has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 \\"personal information\\", but it is PII. A Social Security Number (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 \\"personal information\\", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 \\"personal information\\". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 \\"personal information\\". The combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic. However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII. The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm. According to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is \\"sensitive\\", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive. = Australia = In Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition. The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified: This raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from information which does not include a name or address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to find out who it relates to. How much extra effort does it take to make it unreasonable that such information could be identified? For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re- link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be \\"reasonably ascertained\\"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point? It appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law. In particular, online behavioral advertising businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act. Note that the term \\"PII\\" is not used in Australian privacy law. = Canada = Privacy Act governs the Federal Government agencies * Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and similar Provincial legislation governs Provincial Government agencies * Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act governs private corporations, unless there is equivalent Provincial legislation * Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act and other similar Provincial legislation governs health information = European Union = European data protection law does not utilize the concept of personally identifiable information, and its scope is instead determined by non-synonymous, wider concept of \\"personal data\\". * Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights * The General Data Protection Regulation adopted in April 2016.

The protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. Additionally, any person may ask in writing a company (managing data files) the correction or deletion of any personal data. Cesla Amarelle, Droit suisse, √âditions Loisirs et p√©dagogie, 2008.

One of the primary focuses of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is to protect a patient's Protected Health Information (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the Privacy Act of 2005, which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) Anti- Phishing Act of 2005 attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through phishing. U.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the social security number because it can be easily used to commit identity theft. The (proposed) Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005 and (proposed) Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005 each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number. = NIST definition = The National Institute of Standards and Technology is a physical sciences laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness The following data, often used for the express purpose of distinguishing individual identity, clearly classify as personally identifiable information under the definition used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (described in detail below): * National identification number (e.g., Social Security number in the U.S.) * Bank account numbers * Passport number * Driver's license number * Credit card numbers The following are less often used to distinguish individual identity, because they are traits shared by many people. However, they are potentially PII, because they may be combined with other personal information to identify an individual. * Full Name * Home Address * City * State * Postcode * Country * Telephone * Age, Date of Birth, especially if non-specific * Gender or race * Web cookie When a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as \\"a 34-year-old white male who works at Target\\". Note that information can still be private, in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, ZIP code, and full date of birth. In hacker and Internet slang, the practice of finding and releasing such information is called \\"doxing\\". It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement. On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the \\"doxed\\" individual may panic and disappear.  State laws and significant court rulings  California  The California state constitution declares privacy an inalienable right in Article 1, Section 1.  California Online Privacy Protection Act (OPPA) of 2003  SB 1386 requires organizations to notify individuals when PII (in combination with one or more additional, specific data elements) is known or believed to be acquired by an unauthorized person.  In 2011, the California State Supreme Court ruled that a person's ZIP code is PII. * Nevada  Nevada Revised Statutes 603A-Security of Personal Information * Massachusetts  201 CMR 17.00: Standards for The Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth  In 2013, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that ZIP codes are PII.Tyler v.

Criminals may go to great trouble to avoid leaving any PII, such as by: * wearing masks, sunglasses, or clothing to obscure or completely hide distinguishing features, such as eye, skin, and hair colour, facial features, and personal marks such as tattoos, birthmarks, moles and scars. * wearing gloves to conceal fingerprints, which themselves are PII. However, gloves can also leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.James W.H. McCord and Sandra L. McCord, Criminal Law and Procedure for the paralegal: a systems approach, supra, p. 127. * avoiding writing anything in their own handwriting. * masking their internet presence with methods such as using a proxy server to appear to be connecting from an IP address unassociated with oneself.  Personal safety  Personal data is a key component of our Online identity and can be exploited by individuals. For instance, data can be altered and be used to create fake documents, hijack mail boxes and phone calls or harass people, like on the data breach from the EE Limited company. Another key case can be referred as Financial Identity Theft , usually about bank account and credit card information being stolen, and then being used or sold. Personal data can also be used to create fake Online identity, including fake accounts and profiles (that can be referred as Identity Cloning , or Identity Fraud) for celebrities to gather data from other users more easily. Even individuals can be concerned, especially for personal purpose (this is more widely known as Sockpuppet (internet)). The most critical information, such as password, date of birth, ID documents or Social Insurance Number, can be used to log in to different websites (See Password reuse and Account verification) to gather more information and access more content. Also, several agencies ask for discretion on subject related to their work, for the safety of their employees. For this reason, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of personally identifiable information of DoD personnel. Many intelligence agencies have similar policies, sometimes to the point where employees do not disclose to their friends that they work for the agency. Similar identity protection concerns exist for witness protection programs, women's shelters, and victims of domestic violence and other threats. Trade of personal data During the second half of the 20th century, the digital revolution introduced \\"privacy economics\\", or the trade of personal data. The value of data can change over time and over different contexts. Disclosing data can reverse information asymmetry, though the costs of doing so can be unclear. In relation to companies, consumers often have \\"imperfect information regarding when their data is collected, with what purposes, and with what consequences.\\" Writing in 2015, Alessandro Acquisti, Curtis Taylor and Liad Wagman identified three \\"waves\\" in the trade of personal data: #In the 1970s, the Chicago Boys school claimed that protection of privacy could have a negative impact on the market because it could lead to incorrect and non-optimal decisions. Other researchers like Andrew F. Daughety and Jennifer F. Reinganum suggested that the opposite was true, and that absence of privacy would also lead to this. #In the mid 1990s, Varian retook the Chicago Boys approach and added a new externality, stating that the consumer would not always have perfect information on how their own data would be used. Kenneth C. Laudon developed a model in which individuals own their data and have the ability to sell it as a product. He believed that such a system should not be regulated, to create a free market. #In the 2000s, researchers worked on price discrimination (Taylor, 2004), two-sided markets (Corni√®re, 2011) and marketing strategies (Anderson and de Palma, 2012). The theories became complex, and showed that the impact of privacy on the economy highly depended on the context.

Career Bhutto entered the Legislative Council of the Bombay Province, of which Sindh was a part, in 1921 at the age of 33. He continued till 1936. During this time, he received the honours of CIE followed by knighthood. In 1934, he became a minister in the Bombay government. Bhutto attended the Round Table Conference in 1931 as a leader of Sindhi Muslims demanding separation of Sind from the Bombay province. This was eventually granted in the Government of India Act 1935, with Sind becoming a separate province on 1 April 1936. Bhutto was appointed as a chief advisor to the Governor of Sind. In preparation for the provincial elections in 1937, the Sind United Party was formed by Haji Abdullah Haroon and Bhutto joined it as the vice-chairman of the party. It was modeled after the Punjab Unionist Party and claimed to represent all Sindhis irrespective of religion. Nevertheless, Bhutto brought leading pirs (Sufi saints) to influence the voters 'religiously' to cast their votes in his favour.Ansari, Sarah F. D. Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947. Cambridge South Asian studies, 50. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. pp. 115-116 The Sind United Party emerged as the largest party in the elections, winning 21 out of 60 seats. However, both Harron and Bhutto failed to get elected. The Larkana seat, which Bhutto had contested, was won by Sheikh Abdul Majid Sindhi. The Governor invited Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, the leader of the Sind Muslim Party and a political rival of Bhutto in Sind, to form a government. Large scale defections took place in the Assembly, Bhutto resigned from the party and Haroon eventually merged his party into the All-India Muslim League.Afzal, Nasreen. Role of Sir Abdullah Haroon in Politics of Sindh (1872-1942) Bhutto returned to Bombay to become the Chairman of the Bombay- Sind Public Service Commission. Dewan of Junagadh Early in 1947, Bhutto joined the council of ministers of Muhammad Mahabat Khan III the Nawab of Junagadh in the modern-day province of Gujarat, becoming its Dewan, or prime minister in May. At the time of the independence of India in 1947, the princely states were asked by the British to decide whether to join the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or to remain autonomous and outside them. The Constitutional Advisor to the Nawab, Nabi Baksh, indicated to Lord Mountbatten that he was recommending that the State should join India. However, the Nawab did not make a decision. Early in 1947, Bhutto was invited to join the Council of Ministers of the Nawab. In May, when the Dewan Abdul Khadir Muhammad Hussain went abroad for medical treatment, Bhutto was appointed as the Dewan. On 15 August 1947, the State announced that it had acceded to Pakistan. On 13 September 1947, the Government of Pakistan accepted the accession. However, the Hindu citizens of the State revolted, leading to several events and also a plebiscite, resulting in the integration of Junagadh into India.Gandhi, Rajmohan (1991). Patel: A Life. India: Navajivan. p. 292. Nawab Muhammad Mahabat Khan III of Junagadh (erstwhile Babi Nawab dynasty of Junagadh) fled to Sindh, Pakistan. As Dewan of Junagarh; it was Shah Nawaz Bhutto who wrote and signed the letter addressed to Indian Government to come and take over the administration of the Junagadh state. Shah Nawaz Bhutto moved to Larkana District, where his land-ownership made him among the wealthiest and most influential people in Sindh.http://www.bhutto.org/sir- shahnawaz-bhutto.php, Retrieved 7 Jan 2017 Bhutto was a good friend of Governor General (later President) Iskander Mirza, who was a regular guest for the annual hunt in Larkana, staying at the Bhutto family home called Al- Murtaza. In the winter of 1955-1956, Mirza brought General Ayub Khan with him to Larkana for the hunt. Honours and legacy The British imperial government awarded Bhutto the title of Khan Sahib, subsequently raising it to Khan Bahadur. Bhutto was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (OBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours list, with a further appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1925 New Year Honours list. In the 1930 New Year Honours, Bhutto was knighted, and was invested with his knighthood on 27 February 1930 at Viceroy's House in New Delhi by the Viceroy of India, the Lord Irwin.Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto * He was a Delegate to the Round Table Conference in London in 1930-31 as a leader of Sindhi Muslims demanding separation of Sindh from the Bombay Province * Pakistan Postal Services issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' series. Family Bhutto was a first cousin once removed of Wahid Baksh Bhutto, who in 1924 was made a sardar and in 1926 was elected to the Imperial Legislative Assembly from Sindh, a constituency of the Bombay Presidency, becoming the first member of the Bhutto family to be elected to public office. Shah Nawaz Bhutto was married to Khursheed Begum, formerly Lakhi Bai, who was of a modest Hindu family. She converted from Hinduism to Islam before her marriage.Burki, Shahid Javed, Historical Dictionary of Pakistan, Scarecrow Press, 1991, Her brothers remained Hindu and eventually migrated to India. Their children included Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and a daughter called Mumtaz, who married Brigadier Muhammad Mustafa Khan Bahadur of the Sidi clan. Their first child, Sikandar, died from pneumonia at the age of seven in 1914, and their second child, Imdad Ali, died of cirrhosis at the age of thirty-nine in 1953. Their son Zulfikar Ali was born in his parents' residence near Larkana, and was their third child.

Mahm≈´d ibn Mu·∏•ammad ibn Umar al-Jaghmini () or 'al-Chaghmƒ´nƒ´', or al-Jaghmini, was a 13th or 14th-century Arab physician, astronomer and author of the Qanunshah (The Canon of Medicine) a short epitome of by Avicenna in Persian, and Mulakhkhas (Summary), a work on astronomy completed in 808 AH - 1405/6 AD. Life Little of him is known beyond what is indicated by his name, that he was a native of Jaghmin, a village in Khwarezm (Khiva), current day Uzbekistan. Confusion over the date of his death also exists as both 1344 and 1221 have been cited. Qanunshah The popularity of the Qanunshah may be indicated by the number of scholarly commentaries it produced. Two were by contemporaries of his, the scientists Ghazƒ´ Zade R≈´mi and Mƒ´r Seyed Sharƒ´f Gorganƒ´. Several versefied versions were also produced and considerable evidence exists of its use in medical teaching in the eastern provinces of the Islamic world. Mulakhkhas The celebrated Ottoman-Turkish historian Haji Khalifa, in his biographic account contained in Sullam al-Wus≈´l, mentions reading al-Jaghmini's Mulakhkhas, together with another astronomical work, Ashkal al-ta'sis by Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Ashraf al-Samarqandi, with his tutor A'rej Mehmed Efendi, between the years 1643-45 AD. A treatise by Musa ibn Muhammad Qadizade al-Rumi (fl. AH 815/1412 AD) called Sharh al- mulakhas fi al-hay'a (Compendium of the Science of Astronomy, seems to have been a commentary on it.

Life Born to a mill foreman in Kafr Dawar, Egypt, Abouhalima spent his adolescence with the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an outlawed Islamic group that heralded Omar Abdel Rahman as their spiritual leader. He briefly attended Alexandria University, but dropped out and left Egypt altogether in 1981, moving to Germany. There, he later recalled he had lived a life \\"of corruption - girls, drugs, you name it\\".Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. \\"The Age of Sacred Terror\\", 2002 The following year, Germany denied him political asylum, and he quickly married Renate Soika, a troubled German woman, which guaranteed he could remain in the country. He divorced Soika three years later but in short order married another woman named Marianne Weber in a Muslim ceremony. He flew to Brooklyn with his new wife and after his American tourist visa expired, applied for amnesty claiming to be an agricultural worker and was accepted as a permanent resident under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. He worked as a New York City cabdriver for five years from 1986‚Äì1991, though he saw his license suspended ten times during that period, for failing to attend traffic court for cab violations including traffic violations and an attempt to overcharge a customer. In his free time, Abouhalima worked long hours for a non-profit group in Brooklyn that raised money for the Afghan Mujahideen. Militancy Abouhalima travelled to Afghanistan in 1988, saying he wanted to prove he \\"was a Muslim, not a sheep\\", and received combat-training in Peshawar. Ali Mohamed, a sergeant at Fort Bragg, provided United States Army manuals and other assistance to individuals at the al-Farouq Mosque, and some members including Abouhalima and El Sayyid Nosair practiced at the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island, many of the group wearing t-shirts reading \\"Help Each Other in Goodness and Piety...A Muslim to a Muslim is a Brick Wall\\" with a map of Afghanistan emblazoned in the middle. Abouhalima wore an NRA cap during their practices. When Nosair assassinated Meir Kahane, Abouhalima was driving the purported getaway car, although Nosair accidentally jumped into another cab by mistake. He was the subject of an FBI investigation through January 1993, at which point the investigation was called off, shortly before the World Trade Center bombing. On February 26, 1993, the day of the WTC bombing, he was seen by several witnesses with Mohammed A. Salameh at the Jersey City storage facility allegedly used to prepare the explosives.

It was founded in 1907 and now represents nearly one million members (caravanners, motorhomers and campervanners). History Caravan Club logo used until 2017. The Club was founded in 1907 as The Caravan Club of Great Britain and Ireland. Its aim was to \\"... bring together those interested in van life as a pastime...to improve and supply suitable vans and other appliances...to develop the pastime by collecting, publishing and supplying to members, books and periodicals and lists of camp sites etc... to arrange camping grounds...\\". The Club was renamed as The Caravan Club in 1959 and celebrated its centenary on 14 June 2007. The club's current name, the Caravan and Motorhome Club was adopted in February 2017. Structure The Caravan Club is a membership organisation. The Club is led by the Executive Committee, which airs policy issues with the Club Council. The council in turn is supported by the 10 Regional Councils. Their aim of the Regional Councils is to coordinate communications throughout The Club membership. Regional Councils provide a forum to discuss Club issues and to solve local and regional problems. Club members may also vote at the Annual Members Meeting. The Club is a member of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), an organisation that represents the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users. The Club has over 900 staff and an annual turnover of over ¬£100 million. The Caravan and Motorhome Club represents nearly one million tourers. Sites The Club operates around 200 main Caravan Club sites and over 2,200 smaller certificated \\"five-van\\" sites, known as CLs (certificated locations). =Certificated locations (CLs)= Sandringham estate A certificated location (or 'CL') is an informal privately owned caravan site for up to 5 caravans in the United Kingdom. Visitors with caravans pay a small fee to the CL owner in order to pitch overnight. This is usually cheaper than larger commercial caravan sites. There are over 2200 CLs in the UK and they are for exclusive use by Caravan And Motorhome Club members. Each year the Caravan And Motorhome Club issues a certificate to those sites that continue to meet their standards, hence 'certificated locations'. Caravan And Motorhome Club members vote annually for the best CL in the 'CL of the Year' competition. Most CLs are in the countryside, they are individually owned and can be on a farm or smallholding, on spare land next to a pub, golf course or hotel or on land attached to the owner's house. CLs need no site licence or formal planning permission, but are covered by two Acts of Parliament: *Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 and *Caravans Act (Northern Ireland) (1963) Chapter 17. The laws state that visitors with caravans must be members of The Caravan And Motorhome Club, who are required to act responsibly and to observe the Country Code and no more than 5 caravans may be accommodated on the site at any one time. Caravans may not stay for more than 28 days per visit and must be occupied overnight. CLs are for recreational purposes and only touring caravans, motor caravans or trailer tents are permitted ‚Äì tents are not permitted, other than attached caravan awnings, toilet tents or small pup tents; and permanently sited (static) caravans are not permitted on the same landholding. There are also a number of guidelines stated. For example, CLs should be fairly level and have at least ¬Ω acre of land; and have safe access for caravans including 12 ft wide gateway and safe approach road. If the landowner has a caravan site licence from their Local Authority, the Caravan And Motorhome Club is unlikely to issue a Certificate, unless the CL is entirely separate from the landowner's other business activities. To become a CL, owners should provide an emptying point for chemical closets; a safe drinking water supply; A bin for dry rubbish; and public liability insurance cover. Some owners provide optional extras such as electrical hook ups, showers and toilets. Although exempt from planning permission, CL owners are liable to pay business rates and income tax on their profits. The National Each year, the club holds a \\"National Rally\\" over the Spring Bank holiday at the end of May. The rally usually taking place in the grounds of a stately home and can attract up to 10,000 caravanners at a time. The first National Rally was held at Leamington Spa in 1936 and attracting 100 caravans. In 2007, for the Club's Centenary year, the 80th National Rally was held in the grounds of Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire from Friday 25th to Tuesday 29 May. Other services The club offers a variety of other services with the intention of supporting and improving the lifestyle and holidays of its members. They offer a variety of insurance products including caravan, motorhome, car, breakdown, holiday, home and pet coverage. They also provide overseas ferry and pitch bookings for members looking to holiday overseas, as well as an extensive range of technical advice. The club is also active in lobbying on behalf of its members. Alliances The Caravan Club has developed alliances with a number of groups: * Haven Holidays offers Club members an exclusive deal at 21 of their Touring Parks. * National Cycle Network (co-ordinated by Sustrans) offers 12,000 miles of signed cycle routes throughout the UK.

The preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti-German sentiment and the approach of the Soviet Red Army and the US Third Army offered a chance of success. On 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, Czech citizens spontaneously attacked the German occupiers and Czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising. The Russian Liberation Army, which had been fighting for the Germans, defected and supported the Czechs. German troops counter-attacked, but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the Czech citizenry. On 8 May, the Czech and German leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the German forces to withdraw from the city, but not all Waffen-SS units obeyed. Fighting continued until 9 May, when the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city. The uprising was brutal, with both sides committing war crimes. Violence against Germans, sanctioned by the Czechoslovak government, continued after the liberation, and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage Germans to flee. George Patton‚Äôs US Third Army was ordered by General Dwight Eisenhower not to come to the aid of the Czech insurgents, which undermined the credibility of the Western powers in postwar Czechoslovakia. Instead, the uprising was presented as a symbol of Czech resistance to Nazi rule, and the liberation by the Red Army was used by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase popular support for communism. Background =German occupation= Czech districts with a high ethnic German population; the northern portions were annexed by Germany in 1938. In 1938, the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, announced his intention to annex the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia with a high ethnic German population. As the previous appeasement of Hitler had shown, the governments of both France and Britain were intent on avoiding war. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier negotiated with Hitler and ultimately acquiesced to his demands at the Munich Agreement, in exchange for guarantees from Nazi Germany that no additional lands would be annexed. No Czechoslovak representatives were present at the negotiations. Five months later, when the Slovak Diet declared the independence of Slovakia, Hitler summoned Czechoslovak President Emil H√°cha to Berlin and forced him to accept the German occupation of the Czech rump state and its re-organisation into the German-dominated Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Germany promptly invaded and occupied the remaining Czech territories. Although France had a defensive alliance with Czechoslovakia, neither the French nor British intervened militarily. The Nazis considered many Czechs to be ethnically Aryan, and therefore suitable for Germanisation. As a consequence, the German occupation was less harsh than in other Slavic nations. Wartime living standards were actually higher in the occupied region than in Germany itself. However, freedom of speech was curtailed and 400,000 Czechs were conscripted for forced labour in the Reich. During the six-year occupation, more than 20,000 Czechs were executed and thousands more died in concentration camps. In 1941, the Nazi Reinhard Heydrich was made Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia and began enforcing the occupation more harshly. Within five days of Heydrich's arrival, 142 people were executed. His brutality led to the Allies ordering his assassination the following year, but the Germans killed more than a thousand Czechs in reprisal, including the entire villages of Lidice and Le≈æ√°ky. While the general violence of the occupation was much less severe than in Eastern Europe, it nevertheless incited violent anti-German sentiment in many Czechs. =Military situation= During the spring of 1945, partisan forces in Bohemia and Moravia totalled about 120 groups, with a combined strength of around 7,500 people. Partisans disrupted the railway and highway transportation by sabotaging track and bridges and attacking trains and stations. Some railways could not be used at night or on some days, and trains were forced to travel at a slower speed. Waffen-SS units retreating from the Red Army's advance into Moravia burned down entire villages as a reprisal. Despite losing much of their leadership to a March 1945 purge by the Gestapo, Communist groups in Prague distributed propaganda leaflets calling for an insurrection. German soldiers and civilians became increasingly worried and prepared to flee violent retaliation for the occupation. In an attempt to reassert German authority, SS police general Karl Hermann Frank broadcast a message over the radio threatening to destroy Prague and drown any opposition in blood. In early 1945, former Czechoslovak Army officers set up the commanded by General to oversee fighting inside Prague, and the under General Franti≈°ek Sluneƒçko to direct insurgent units in the suburbs. Meanwhile, the Czech National Council (cs), with representatives from various Czech political parties, formed to take over political leadership after the overthrow of the Nazi and collaborationist authorities. Military leaders planning an uprising within Prague counted on the loyalty of ethnically Czech members of the police and the Government Army of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as employees of key civil services, such as transport workers and the fire brigade. The Russian Liberation Army (ROA), composed of Soviet POWs that had agreed to fight for Nazi Germany, was stationed outside of Prague. Hoping that the ROA could be persuaded to switch sides in order to avoid accusations of collaboration, the Czech military command sent an envoy to General Sergei Bunyachenko, commander of the 1st ROA Infantry Division (600th German Infantry Division). Bunyachenko agreed to help the Czechs. On 4 May, the US Third Army under General George S. Patton entered Czechoslovakia. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the only political leader to advocate the liberation of Prague by the Western Allies. In a telegram to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Churchill said that \\"the liberation of Prague...by US troops might make the whole difference to the postwar situation of Czechoslovakia and might well influence that in nearby countries.\\" Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, also wanted his forces to liberate the city, and asked that the Americans stop at Plze≈à, 50 miles to the west. The Red Army was planning a major offensive into the Protectorate, due to start 7 May. Eisenhower, disinclined to accept American casualties or risk antagonising the Soviet Union, acquiesced to the Soviet demands that the Red Army enter Prague. Uprising =5 May= Staff of Czech Radio opposed to the occupation began the morning by broadcasting in the banned Czech language. The Barto≈° Command and Communist groups met separately and both scheduled the armed uprising to begin 7 May. Czech citizens gathered in the streets, vandalised German inscriptions, and tore down German flags. Czechoslovak flags appeared openly in windows and on jacket lapels. Tram operators refused to accept Reichmarks or to give the stops in German, as was required by the occupiers. Some German soldiers were surrounded and killed. In response to growing popular agitation, Frank threatened to shoot Czechs gathering in the streets, and increased armed German patrols. Some German soldiers began to fire into the crowds. Around noon, the radio broadcast a series of appeals to the police and gendarmerie requesting aid in fighting SS guards inside the radio building. A detachment of Government Army policemen responded to the call, and met stiff resistance as they retook the building. During the entire time, the radio continued to broadcast. Although not directed at the populace, the appeal ignited fighting all over the city, concentrated in the downtown districts. Crowds of unarmed civilians, mostly young men with no military training, overwhelmed German garrisons and stores. Many casualties were inflicted by German soldiers and civilians sniping from strong-points or rooftops; in response, Czech forces began to intern Germans and suspected collaborators. Czech noncombatants assisted by setting up makeshift hospitals for the wounded and bringing food, water, and other necessities to the barricades, while German forces were often resorted to looting to obtain essential supplies. Czech forces seized thousands of firearms, hundreds of Panzerfausts, and five armoured vehicles, but still suffered a shortage of weapons. By the end of the day, the resistance had seized most of the city east of the Vltava River. The insurgents held many important buildings, including the radio, the telephone exchange, most railway stations, and ten of twelve bridges. Three thousand prisoners were liberated from Pankr√°c Prison. By controlling the telephone exchange, resistance fighters were able to sever communication between German units and commanders. German forces held most of the territory to the west of the river, including an airfield at Ruzynƒõ, northwest of the city, and various surrounded garrisons such as the Gestapo Headquarters. At the orders of Field Marshal Ferdinand Sch√∂rner, in command of Axis forces in Bohemia, Waffen-SS units were pulled from fighting the Red Army and sent into Prague. The SS was relatively well-equipped with tanks, armoured carriers, weaponry and motorised units. Information on this force movement reached insurgent headquarters late in the day. The radio broadcast appeals in English and Russian for an air attack on the tanks. Hearing of events in Prague, Patton asked for permission to advance to the Vltava in order to aid the Czech resistance, but Eisenhower refused. The Red Army was ordered to advance the launch of its offensive to 6 May. =6 May= Barricades along a street in Prague, erected to prevent the passage of tanks and give Czech insurgents cover from German fire. Late in the evening on 5 May, the radio broadcast an appeal to the people in the streets of Prague to build barricades in order to slow the anticipated German attack. Despite poor weather, tens of thousands of civilians worked overnight to construct over 1,600 barricades by morning. A total of 2,049 were constructed by the end of the uprising. SS General Carl Friedrich von P√ºckler-Burghauss ordered the Luftwaffe to firebomb Prague, but the attack had to be scaled back due to lack of fuel. The first strike was made by two Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter-bombers from elements of KG 51 at Ruzynƒõ. One of their targets was the radio building, which was hit by a 250-kg bomb that disabled the transmitter. However, the radio continued to broadcast from alternate locations. In successive attacks, the Luftwaffe bombed barricades and hit apartment buildings with incendiary bombs, causing many civilian casualties. At midday, the First Battalion of the ROA entered Prague and attacked the Germans; during its time in Prague, it disarmed around 10,000 German soldiers. An American reconnaissance patrol met with an ROA officer as well as Czech leaders. This was when the Czechs learnt of the demarcation line agreement and that the Third Army was not coming to liberate Prague. As a consequence, the Czech National Council, which had not been involved in negotiations with Bunyachenko, denounced the ROA. A Soviet liberation meant that they could not politically afford to endorse the ROA, whom Stalin considered traitors. Despite the rejection of the ROA, their aid to Prague became a point of friction between Moscow and Czechoslovakia after the war. =7 May= Under the terms of the provisional unconditional surrender, signed in the early hours of 7 May, German forces had a forty- eight-hour grace period to cease offensive operations.Act of Military Surrender Signed at Rheims at 0241 on the 7th day of May 1945, The Avalon Project, Yale Law School, ¬© 1996‚Äì2007, The Lillian Goldman Law Library in Memory of Sol Goldman. Eisenhower hoped that the capitulation would put an end to the fighting in Prague and therefore obviate American intervention. However, the German leadership was determined to use the grace period to move as many soldiers as possible westward to surrender to the Americans. Sch√∂rner denounced the rumours of a ceasefire in Prague and said that the truce did not apply to German forces fighting the Red Army or Czech insurgents. On 7 May, the US Third Army was much closer to Prague than Soviet forces. In order to gain control of Prague's transportation network, the Germans launched their strongest attack of the uprising. Waffen-SS armoured and artillery units arriving in Prague gradually punched through the barricades with several tank attacks. Intense fighting was accompanied with the SS use of Czech civilians as human shields and damage to the Old Town Hall and other historic buildings. When the Barto≈° Command learnt of the Rheims surrender, it ordered an immediate ceasefire for Czech forces. This caused some confusion among the defenders, who were also suffering from desertion due to the worsening military situation. The ROA played a decisive role in slowing the progress of the Germans, but withdrew from Prague over the afternoon and evening in order to surrender to the US Army. Only a few ROA units stayed in the city, departing late on 8 May. With the bulk of the ROA gone, the poorly armed and untrained Czech insurgents fared badly against the reinforced German forces. By the end of the day, German forces had taken much of the rebel-held territory east of the Vltava, with the resistance only holding a salient in the Vinohrady-Stra≈°nice area. ROA forces captured the Luftwaffe airfield at Ruzynƒõ, destroying several aircraft. =8 May= In the morning, the Germans made an air and artillery bombardment followed by a renewed infantry attack. The fighting was almost as intense as the previous day. One particularly fierce battle took place at the Masaryk train station. At 10 am, SS troops captured the station and murdered around 50 surrendered resistance fighters and noncombatants (cs). In one of the last battles of the uprising, Czech insurgents regained the train station at 2 am on 9 May and photographed the victims' bodies. Faced with military collapse, no arriving Allied help, and threats to destroy the city, the Czech National Council agreed to negotiate with Wehrmacht General Rudolf Toussaint. Toussaint, running out of time to evacuate Wehrmacht units westward, was in an equally desperate position. After several hours of negotiations, it was agreed that on the morning of 9 May, the Czechs would allow German soldiers to pass westward through Prague, and in exchange German forces leaving the city would surrender their arms. A ceasefire was finally agreed to around midnight. However, some pockets of German forces were unaware of or disobeyed the ceasefire, and civilians feared a continuation of the German atrocities which had intensified over the previous two days. Late in the evening, reports reached Prague of the liberation of Theresienstadt concentration camp, northwest of the city, and the advance of the Red Army into other areas north of Prague. =9 May= The last of the German forces to escape Prague left in the early hours of the morning. At 4:00, elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front reached the suburbs of Prague. Fighting was mostly with isolated SS units that had been prevented from withdrawing by Czech insurgents. Over the next few hours, the Red Army quickly overcame the remaining German forces. Because most of the Germans had already left, the 1st Ukrainian Front avoided the house-to-house fighting that had occurred in the capture of Budapest and Vienna. The Red Army lost only ten soldiers in what has been described as their \\"easiest victory\\" of the war. At 8:00 am, the tanks reached the centre city and the radio announced the arrival of the Soviet forces. Czechs poured out into the streets to welcome the Red Army. War crimes =German = SA tortured and murdered 44 people. German forces committed war crimes against Czech civilians throughout the uprising. Many people were killed in summary executions, and the SS used Czech civilians as human shields, forced them to clear barricades at gunpoint, and threatened to shoot hostages in revenge for German soldiers killed in action. When tanks were halted by barricades, they were known to fire into surrounding houses. After violently evicting or murdering the inhabitants, German soldiers looted and burned Czech houses and apartment buildings. On several occasions, more than twenty people were killed at once; most of the massacres occurred on 7 and 8 May. Among those killed were pregnant women and young children, and some of the dead were found mutilated. After the uprising, a Czech police report described war crimes committed by the Nazis: In addition to the war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht and the SS, Luftwaffe soldiers, along with the SA, participated in the torture and murder of prisoners held at the Na Pra≈æaƒçce school. =Czech = The Czechoslovak government-in-exile planned to expel the German minority of Czechoslovakia in order to create an ethnically pure Czech-Slovak nation-state. Throughout the occupation, Czech politicians had broadcast messages from London calling for violence against German civilians and suspected Czech collaborators. President Edvard Bene≈° believed that vigilante justice would be less divisive than trials, and that encouraging Germans to flee would spare the effort of deporting them later. Before he arrived in Czechoslovakia, he broadcast that \\"everyone who deserves death should be totally liquidated... in the popular storm\\" and urged the resistance to avenge Nazi crimes \\"a thousand times over.\\" Minister of Justice asked resistance leaders to make liberation \\"bloody\\" for the Germans and to drive them out with violence. Communist leaders also supported the violence. Military leaders not only overlooked anti-German massacres and failed to punish the perpetrators, but actively encouraged them. The Czech Radio likely played a role in inciting the violence by passing on the anti-German messages of these political leaders, as well as broadcasting anti-German messages on its own initiative. Almost no one was prosecuted for violence against Germans, and a bill was proposed in the postwar parliament that would have retroactively legalised it. In Prague, Czech insurgents murdered surrendered German soldiers and German civilians both before and after the arrival of the Red Army. Historian argues that there was no clear-cut distinction between the end of the uprising and the beginning of the expulsions. Some captured German soldiers were hung from lampposts and burned to death, or otherwise tortured and mutilated. Czech rioters also assaulted, raped, and robbed German civilians. Not all those killed or affected by anti-German violence were actually German or collaborators, as perpetrators frequently acted on suspicion, or exploited the chaos to settle personal grudges. In one massacre at Bo≈ôislavka on 10 May, forty German civilians were murdered. During and after the uprising, thousands of German civilians and surrendered soldiers were interned in makeshift camps where food and hygiene were poor. Survivors claimed that beatings and rape were commonplace. The violence against German civilians continued throughout the summer, culminating in the expulsion of Sudeten Germans. About three million Czechoslovak citizens of German ethnicity were stripped of their citizenship and property and forcibly deported. Legacy As \\"the greatest military action of the Czechs for freedom and national independence fought on their own territory,\\" in the words of journalist , the Prague uprising became a national myth of the new Czechoslovak republic and the subject of much literature. The Western Allies' failure to liberate Prague was seen as emblematic of their lack of concern for Czechoslovakia, first demonstrated by the Munich Agreement. It also served as a blow to democratic forces within the country who opposed Czechoslovakia's drift towards communism in the years after the war. It was not forgotten that Stalin had opposed the Munich Agreement, and Prague's liberation by the Red Army turned public opinion in favour of communism. Few Czechs were aware of the demarcation line agreement between the Western Allied and Soviet forces, allowing communists to accuse the American forces of \\"having remained a cowardly or cynical onlooker while Prague was struggling for life,\\" in the words of Hungarian historian Stephen Kertesz. According to British diplomat Sir Orme Sargent, the Prague uprising was the moment that \\"Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West.\\" In 1948, the democratic government of Czechoslovakia was toppled by a Communist coup d'√©tat. Following the coup, Czechoslovakia became a communist state aligned with the Soviet Union until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The Communist government attempted to discredit the Czech resistance, which was considered a threat to Communist legitimacy, by purging or arresting former resistance leaders, and distorting history, for instance overstating the role of the working class in the uprising and inflating the number of Red Army soldiers killed in Prague.

Budlong, founder of Budlong Pickle Company. Collection of the Chicago Public Library.The Budlong Pickle Company was an American company based in Chicago that made and marketed pickles from its own cucumbers. Founded in the late 1850s, it was sold in 1958 to a company which was later acquired by Dean Foods. The Budlong pickle legacy has recently been revived as the namesake of a hot dog restaurant in Chicago.  Background  In the 19th century, Chicago was a powerhouse of American agriculture. The Union Stock Yards was the center of American meatpacking, and the Chicago Board of Trade provided financial support for investment in agricultural commodities. In addition to its dominance in meatpacking and the grain trade, Chicago was a center of American pickle industry in the late 19th century. Among the reasons for Chicago's pickle prominence were ample supplies of salt and a robust rail infrastructure. The Budlong family, an old Rhode Island family and the namesake of Budlong Farm, were established farmers and picklers on the East Coast, with a large operation in Cranston, Rhode Island.  Early history  In the late 1850s, Lyman A. Budlong (1829‚Äì1909) started a large farm in Chicago‚Äîin an area now named Budlong Woods‚Äîcalled the Budlong Nursery. Dates of the Nursery's establishment vary, but it must have been in 1857, the year that Lyman first came to Chicago, or later. The Nursery, nicknamed the \\"village of glass\\" after its many greenhouses, produced large quantities of cucumbers, onions, and other vegetables. It also grew flowers. Approximately in size, the center of the farm was at what is now the intersection of California and Foster Avenues in the Budlong Woods section of Chicago's Lincoln Square community area. The Budlong Pickle Company, founded in 1857 or 1859, was initially part of the same enterprise as the Nursery. In 1903, the Chicago Sunday Tribune called Budlong's the largest pickle farm in the world; as of 1928, the Tribune called \\"one of the largest pickle factories in the world\\". It sold approximately 100,000 bushels of pickled cucumbers per year during the late 19th century. In 1899, Joseph J. Budlong‚ÄîLyman's brother‚Äîpatented a vegetable sorting device \\"particularly applicable to the sorting or grading of pickles according to size\\".. The factory was located at the intersection of Lincoln and Berwyn avenues, and a special \\"pickle train\\" ran on the Chicago and North Western line to pick up its employees. The farm employed a number of laborers who had immigrated to the United States from central and eastern Europe. As of 1903, workers earned an average of $1.25 per day, or approximately $ today; some earned as little as 25 cents, or around $. The Nursery property was a golf course by the late 1920s, but the Pickle Company continued operations thereafter. Lyman Budlong had reportedly made at least $1.5 million (approximately ) from the Nursery as of his death .  Mid- century and sale  George L. Hathaway was Budlong's longtime president. In 1945, Hathaway was presented with an award by the National Pickle Packers Association for demonstrating \\"outstanding fairness ‚Ä¶ in procuring pickles for the armed forces\\". Budlong had operations in Columbia, Mississippi, as of 1936; and in Ora, Indiana, as of 1940. In 1958, it merged with a Green Bay, Wisconsin‚Äìbased food company specializing in pickles, which was later acquired by Dean Foods (now part of Dairy Farmers of America).  Present day  Although the Nursery and Pickle Company no longer exist, a Chicago-based hot dog restaurant and food truck has taken on the Budlong name.

Izz al-Din Aydamir al- Jildaki (), also written al-Jaldaki (died 1342/743 H) was an Egyptian alchemist from 14th century Mamluk Sultanate. Life Despite being one of the most important Islamic scholars of the 14th century, almost nothing is known about his early life. Al-Jildaki was probably born in Egypt into a family of Turkic Mamluk origin. In his writings he reveals that he spent seventeen years traveling through Iraq, Anatolia, Yemen, North Africa, and Syria Based on a speculative vocalization of his Nisba as \\"al-Jaldaki \\", some 20th century writers like Henry Corbin suggested that he was originally from Jaldak, a town in Khorasan before emigrating to Egypt \\"Lastly, answering the third question requires us to revisit the position of Henry Corbin who pegged al-Jildaki as an Iranian emigre to the Mamluk domains.\\" Nicholas G. Harris has criticized this theory noting that it was never mentioned in any pre-modern source before. \\"Otherwise, apart from this one putative instance, \\"al-Jaldaki as a name element denoting an origin from the village of Jaldak does not exist in any pre-modern source.\\" Instead, he notes that all the biographical information known about him- like his Turkic name \\"Aydamir\\", places of residence and native language- would make sense only when set against a Mamluk background. \\"If al-Jildaki had been a native of a town outside of Mashad, born shortly after the turn of the 14th century, we would expect him to be a Persian speaker, born and raised in a village inside Ilkhanid controlled territory. Nowhere in his many works is there so much as a hint that al- Jildaki read or understood Persian (or Turkish, for that matter); his works are all in Arabic, and the works on which he commented were all in Arabic. His first name, Aydemir, is also a problem. Aydemir is an archly Turkic name.\\" Harris further notes that the name \\"Jildak\\" and its derivative Nisba \\"Al- Jildaki\\" are attested Turkic names, especially among Mamluk amirs. \\"Thus, the nisba al-Jildaki for a Mamluk means that he was purchased and/or manumitted by a master whose name was Jildak. Jildak is an uncommon but attested Turkic name, especially among Mamluk amirs.\\" Al-Jildaki was one of the last and one of the greatest of medieval Islamic alchemists, he was the author of scientific works such as the al-Misbah fi Ilm al-Miftah (, Key of the Sciences of Lights) and alchemical treatise Kitab al-Burhan fi asrar 'ilm al-mizan (, The Proof Regarding Secrets of the Science of the Balance). He was a prolific author of alchemical writings, of which the United States National Library of Medicine has three. His treatises, which reflect interests much broader than simply alchemy, preserve extensive quotations from earlier authors. He died in Cairo in 1342. References SourcesC.

The story is set in England as Sharpe looks for the missing Second Battalion of the South Essex Regiment needed in Spain to fight in the Napoleonic Wars. Plot summary The South Essex Regiment is in need of recruits so Nairn grants Sharpe permission to return to England to find if the regiment's second battalion has the men needed. Sharpe heads to the battalion headquarters with Harper, D'Alembord and Price and finds only a few wounded men but is told battalion recruiting parties have been seen, yet no-one knows where the recruits go. Sharpe is then summoned before the Prince Regent where he meets Lord Simon Fenner, the secretary of state for war. Fenner has his mistress, Lady Anne Comoynes, seduce Sharpe to find out what he knows, and then sends two soldiers to kill him. Sharpe kills the two assassins and Sharpe's friend Maggie Joyce makes it look as though the bodies are those of Sharpe and Harper. They then join a South Essex recruiting party under assumed names. They are taken to a secret and brutal training camp in Foulness Island, run by the second battalion's commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Girdwood and the regiment's disgraced founder Sir Henry Simmerson. Sharpe learns that Fenner, Simmerson and Girdwood are secretly selling the recruits to other regiments after training them. Harper is sentenced to be hunted to death after he tries to prevent a would-be deserter being killed in cold blood. Sharpe rescues him and, with help from Simmerson's niece Jane Gibbons, they escape to London. Sharpe reports his findings to his former commander Sir William Lawford but Lawford tries to do a deal with Fenner which will see the matter covered up and Sharpe paid off with command of a regiment in the American wars. Lady Anne, who has been forced to prostitute herself to Fenner to pay off her late husband's debts, informs Sharpe. Sharpe and his friends take charge of the training camp from Girdwood but are unable to find evidence of the illegal sales. Instead, Sharpe takes the second battalion to London and presents them to the Prince Regent at Hyde Park, proving they exist. Fenner and Simmerson attempt to have Sharpe court- martialled but are foiled when Lady Anne arrives, having found the incriminating ledgers. Fenner is forced to cancel Lady Anne's debts and give in to Sharpe's demands: A proper second battalion and training camp will be set up, while Sharpe will take the recruited soldiers, including Girdwood, back to Spain with him. He also marries Jane. At the Battle of the Nivelle, Girdwood, the regiment's nominal commander, suffers a complete nervous breakdown after his first experience of battle, leaving Sharpe in command until a new colonel is appointed. Television adaptation The novel was adapted as the opening episode of the fourth season of the Sharpe television series. The adaptation introduced Abigail Cruttenden as Jane and Caroline Langrishe as Lady Anne and guest starred Nicholas Farrell as Fenner, Mark Lambert as Girdwood, Julian Fellowes as the Prince Regent and Julie T. Wallace as Maggie Joyce. It also introduced James Laurenson as an original character, Major-General Ross, who took on the role given to Nairn in the book. The adaptation was faithful to the novel but omitted D'Alembord and Price along with various scenes, including much of the aftermath of the Hyde Park sequence.

Debrett Goes to Hollywood, New York, U.S.A.: St. Martin's Press, 1986, page 43. Lord Ashley shocked London society by marrying Hawkes, an English model and actress from the chorus line. They were divorced after she began an affair with American actor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr, who was named as co-respondent in the petition for divorce. Lord Ashley's second wife was the French-born Fran√ßoise Soulier, daughter of Georges Soulier of Caudebec-en- Caux, France. Lord Ashley and Soulier were married on 31 March 1937 and remained married until his death in 1947. Their two children were: * Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury (22 May 1938 ‚Äì c. 5 November 2004) * Lady Frances Mary Elizabeth Ashley-Cooper (born 9 April 1940). Lord Ashley was heir apparent to the Earldom of Shaftesbury throughout his life. On 8 November 1943, his father appointed him a deputy lieutenant of Dorset. However, at age 46, Ashley died unexpectedly of heart disease before his father. At that time, his son, another Anthony Ashley-Cooper, became heir apparent, inheriting the earldom in 1961 upon the death of his grandfather the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury. Military service Lord Ashley was a cadet in the Eton College contingent of the Officers' Training Corps. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 94th (Dorset & Somersetshire Yeomanry) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery on 26 June 1925. On 1 May 1926, he transferred to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry with the same rank. Lord Ashley was promoted to lieutenant on 12 March 1929. Soon after, on 25 May 1929, he was seconded away from the regiment to serve, from 19 August, as an aide-de-camp to Sir Frederick Sykes, Governor of Bombay, and restored to the establishment on 19 April 1930. He was restored to his unit on 2 May 1931. Lord Ashley was promoted to captain on 26 June 1937, and to major on 5 March 1938. On 5 January 1940, he was removed from the Wiltshire Yeomanry and placed on the general list of Yeomanry officers. Major Lord Ashley was transferred to the Intelligence Corps on 22 July 1940, having requested to serve as a captain during World War II. He served with the Auxiliary Units, which were highly covert Resistance groups trained to engage and counteract the expected invasion of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany. Members of the Auxiliary Unit were stationed in covert hidden bunkers scattered throughout Great Britain. While Major Lord Ashley was trained at Coleshill House near Highworth, Wiltshire, specific details regarding his assignments and operational base remain classified.Lampe, David. The Last Ditch: Britain's Secret Resistance and the Nazi Invasion Plan, London: Greenhill Books, 2007, p. 92. On 18 December 1941, he was transferred to the Territorial Army reserve of officers for the Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Tank Regiment. He was posthumously awarded the Efficiency Decoration. Order of St John On 24 December 1943, Lord Ashley was appointed an Officer of the Order of St John (OStJ).

They were the first team in history to hold both the ROH Tag Team Championship and the CZW Tag Team Championship. History The Backseat Boyz were well known for their work in Combat Zone Wrestling. They began wrestling together in the early years of the company with Dewey Donovan as their manager. The Backseat Boyz became CZW Tag Team Champions by defeating the Haas Brothers in June 2000. They began a feud with Nick Mondo and Ric Blade, who eventually beat them for the tag team title. After losing the title, Acid and Kashmere continued teaming together and competed against teams such as The Briscoes, the H8 Club, and VD. They also competed in singles action, and Trent Acid even won some singles titles. In 2003, The Backseat Boyz joined Messiah in his attempt to take over CZW and eliminate Zandig as part of the Hi-V stable. At Cage of Death V, The Backseat Boyz teamed with the rest of the Hi-V members in the Cage of Death match against Zandig's ultraviolent team. The Backseat Boyz had some setbacks that night as Acid had to wrestle twice and Kashmere had to be the first man in the Cage of Death with Zandig. Both Kashmere and Acid were eliminated from the Cage of Death match, and Hi-V broke up after that night. They only wrestled a few more matches in CZW after Cage of Death, and in February 2004, they officially parted ways with the company. The Backseat Boyz also wrestled in Ring of Honor. They made their ROH debut in 2002 as CZW invaders at Glory By Honor when they jumped in the ring after coming through the crowd and made a challenge to any team. The challenge was accepted by Homicide and Steve Corino. The Backseats won after Corino turned on Homicide. One year later at Glory By Honor II, they competed in a tag team gauntlet match for the vacant ROH Tag Team Championship and won by defeating Special K in the last match. This win made them the first team in history to win the tag team championship in both ROH and CZW. They only held the title for a few weeks as they lost it to Special K at the following show. They continued wrestling together in ROH until Johnny Kashmere left the company, leaving Trent Acid to wrestle in singles competition. The team also competed in their own promotion, Pro Wrestling Unplugged. On June 18, 2010, it was announced by Kashmere on his Facebook that Trent Acid died. He was found dead at his home by his mother. He was 29.

His life was devoted to the study of geometry and reforming advanced mathematical teaching in Italy. His reputation mainly rests on his Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane. He notably enriched our knowledge of algebraic curves and algebraic surfaces. Biography Luigi Cremona was born in Pavia (Lombardy), then part of the Austrian-controlled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. His youngest brother was the painter Tranquillo Cremona. In 1848, when Milan and Venice rose against Austria, Cremona, then only seventeen, joined the ranks of the Italian volunteers. He remained with them, fighting on behalf of his country's freedom, until, in 1849, the capitulation of Venice put an end to the campaign. He then returned to Pavia, where he pursued his studies at the university under Francesco Brioschi, and determined to seek a career as teacher of mathematics. He graduated in 1853 as dottore negli studi di ingegnere civile e architetto. Cremona is noted for the important role he played in bringing about the great geometrical advances in Italy. While, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Italy had very little mathematical standing, the end of the century found Italy in the lead along geometric lines, largely as a result of the work of Cremona. He was very influential in bringing about reforms in the secondary schools of Italy and became a leader in questions of mathematical pedagogy as well as in those relating to the advancement of knowledge. The mathematical advances which Italy made since the middle of the nineteenth century were largely guided by Cremona, Brioschi, and Beltrami.George Abram Miller, Historical Introduction to Mathematical Literature The Macmillan Company, 1916 His first appointment was as elementary mathematical master at the gymnasium and lyceum of Cremona, and he afterwards obtained a similar post at Milan. In 1860 he was appointed to the professorship of higher geometry at the University of Bologna, and in 1866 to that of higher geometry and graphical statics at the higher technical college of Milan. In this same year he competed for the Steiner Prize of the Berlin Academy, with a treatise entitled Memoria sulle superfici del terzo ordine, and shared the award with J. C. F. Sturm. Two years later the same prize was conferred on him without competition. As early as 1856 Cremona had begun to contribute to the Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche, and to the Annali di matematica, of which he became afterwards joint editor. Papers by him appeared in the mathematical journals of Italy, France, Germany and England, and he published several important works, many of which have been translated into other languages. His manual Graphical Statics and his Elements of Projective Geometry (translated by Thomas Hudson Beare and C. Leudesdorf respectively) were published in English by the Clarendon Press. In 1873 he was called to Rome to organize the Royal College of Engineering, and was also appointed professor of higher mathematics at the university. Cremona's reputation had now become European, and in 1879 he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Society. In the same year he became a member of the senate of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1898 he was briefly minister for education. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences elected Cremona as member in 1901. The following year, he was awarded the German Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts. He died in Rome in 1903. WorksElementi di calcolo grafico: ad uso degli Istituti Tecnici (Stamperia reale di G. B.

His older brother, the late Vernon Bellecourt, was also active. Clyde was the seventh of 12 children born to his parents (Charles and Angeline) on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota. His Ojibwe name is Nee-gon-we-way-we-dun which means \\"Thunder Before the Storm.\\" Biography Bellecourt's birthplace is occupied by the largest and poorest of northern Minnesota's Ojibwe bands. In his youth, Clyde fought against the forces of authority, because he did not think they respected his family and other Indians. As a child, he could hear his parents speaking in low tones late at night in a language he did not understand. When he asked what they were saying, he was told to think about his education and do as well as he could. The years in school were not pleasant. As a boy, he attended a reservation mission school run strictly by Benedictine nuns. After the Bellecourt family moved to Minneapolis Twin Cities, the boy Clyde continued to act up in school, receiving detentions. He ultimately incurred more serious charges, resulting in a conviction and sentence to the adult correctional facility at St. Cloud. Clyde was arrested for a succession of offenses‚Äîincluding burglary and robbery. On his 25th birthday, he was transferred to Stillwater Prison in Stillwater, where he served out the remainder of his sentence. Activism Bellecourt helped found AIM in July 1968 with Dennis Banks and George Mitchell of the Leech Lake Reservation during a meeting. in Minneapolis. The meeting was held with the intention of raising awareness to issues American Indians faced in the Twins Cities and to discuss ideas how to solve those problems. Some of the issues discussed included police harassment, discrimination by employers, discrimination in school, poor housing, and unemployment. Bellecourt was elected the group's first chairman, Dennis Banks field director, and Charles Deegan vice chairman. They began to monitor arrests of American Indians made by the local police department to ensure their civil rights and treatment with dignity and respect. In August 1972, Rosebud Reservation tribal chairman Robert Burnette brought forth the idea of a peaceful march on Washington, D.C., which became known as the Trail of Broken Treaties, in order to demand new legislation to remove the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) as an agency of the Department of the Interior. The group involved supported establishing a Federal Indian Commission, reporting directly to the president, in order to ensure that Indian interests were considered in all aspects. Organizers originally planned a peaceful tour of Washington landmarks and meeting with leading government officials to present their \\"20 points,\\" as a list of their grievances. The activists ended up storming and occupying the BIA Headquarters before beginning negotiations for their 20 points. They called for ending the corruption and mismanagement of the BIA. Bellecourt, along with other AIM leaders, led the negotiations with the federal government In 1973 AIM activists were invited to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota by its local civil rights organization to aid in securing better treatment from law enforcement in the border towns, which had been slow to prosecute attacks against Lakota. Protesting discrimination against the Lakota in border towns and the failed impeachment of the elected tribal chairman, Richard Wilson, AIM led an occupation of the Town of Wounded Knee, within the reservation. They were also protesting the poor living conditions on that reservation. FBI agents and U.S. Marshals soon surrounded the town. Bellecourt became a negotiator. Eventually, he, Russell Means, and Carter Camp held a meeting with a representative for the US President. They negotiated an audit of Wilson's operation of tribal finances and an investigation of abuses by his private militia, the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs). After leaving Pine Ridge, Bellecourt and Means were arrested in Pierre, South Dakota, with a bond set at $25,000. They were served a restraining order against approaching closer than five miles to the town of Wounded Knee. After being released on bond, Bellecourt went on a fundraising tour across the United States, trying to raise money for the activists still occupying Wounded Knee. After the occupation of Wounded Knee ended, Bellecourt hosted seminars and other public appearances. He claimed that, \\"the seminar represents the beginning of an educational effort by AIM and a turning point for the organization, which hopes to avoid violent confrontations in the future.\\" Throughout the rest of his speaking tour about Wounded Knee and the BIA takeover, Bellecourt would maintain that Christianity, the Office of Education, and the Federal Government were enemies to Indians. He defended AIM actions at the BIA and Wounded Knee, saying, \\"We are the landlords of the country, it is the end of the month, the rent is due, and AIM is going to collect.\\" 1985 Conviction In January 1986, Bellecourt met with an undercover agent in a laundry room at Little Earth of United Tribes, a south Minneapolis housing development, and sold her LSD. Bellecourt was arrested, along with a group of Indian and non- Indian associates, in possession of an estimated $125,000 worth (5000 \\"hits\\") of LSD and other \\"hard\\" drugs (cocaine). Charged on eight counts of being a major drug distributor, each compounded by a conspiracy charge, Bellecourt accepted a plea bargain arrangement and confessed, entering a guilty plea to lesser felonies shortly thereafter. Federal District Judge Paul Magnuson sentenced him to only five years imprisonment (of which he served less than two). Current involvement Bellecourt lives in South Minneapolis. He continues to direct national and international AIM activities, is a coordinator of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media, and leads Heart of the Earth, Inc., an Interpretive Center located behind AIM's 40-year school site in Minneapolis. Bellecourt founded the Heart of the Earth Survival School in 1972, which was approved for 501(c)(3) status in 1974. The passage of the American Indian Education Act provided possible yearly funding on a competitive basis, which Heart of the Earth was successful in winning for 24 years. It created a pre-school to grade 12 school. In the 1980s, it added adult learning and prison programs. Heart of the Earth has coordinated a national law education program. When it developed into an independent charter school in 1999, Heart of the Earth became the property owner. It continued to offer a wide variety of independent cultural programs, awarded scholarships to Indian students, and developed indigenous language research. The charter was revoked in 2008. The school ceased to exist after serious financial irregularities were discovered, including embezzlement. In all, over 10,000 students attended the school in its 40-year history. Other organizations founded in part by Bellecourt include the Elaine M. Stately Peacemaker Center for Indian youth; the AIM Patrol, which provides security for the Minneapolis Indian community; the Legal Rights Center; MIGIZI Communications, Inc.; the Native American Community Clinic; Women of Nations Eagle Nest Shelter; and Board of American Indian OIC (Opportunities Industrialization Center), a job program to help Native Americans get full-time jobs.*Mosedale, Mike (February 16, 2000). \\"Bury My Heart\\", City Pages.

According to the latest template on road signage in automatic toll stations, this sign shall be posted on the toll station, and the only sign posted prior to passing the station itself is a \\"Kr\\" symbol that is added on the direction signs on roads leading to the toll station. The \\"Kr\\" symbol, road sign 765, is added on the direction signs on roads leading to toll stations. This is the only sign posted prior to the station itself except for in city areas where a new 560-zone sign is posted on city limits. Autopass (stylized autoPASS) is an electronic toll collection system used in Norway. It allows collecting road tolls automatically from cars. It uses electronic radio transmitters and receivers operating at 5.8 GHz (MD5885) originally supplied by the Norwegian companies Q-Free and Fenrits. Since 2013 Kapsch and Norbit supplied the transponders. In 2016 the Norwegian Public Roads Administration revealed that they had chosen Norbit and Q-Free as suppliers of Autopass-transponders the next four years. With an AutoPASS contract it is also possible to use the tag in Denmark and Sweden on ferries and bridges through the EasyGo partnership. In 2019 more and more ferry crossings are also using Autopass as a payment option through the \\"AutoPass for ferry\\" concept. A few crossings are automatic, but most are still manual. If you have a tag you pay only for the vehicle at fully automatic crossings with a 10% discount. If you apply for an Autopass ferry account, which is prepaid, you get a 50%(40% corporate) discount for vehicle, and 17% for passengers at manual payment crossings. See https://www.autopassferje.no for more information. Technology The road sign which indicates an automatic toll collection lane in toll stations that are not automatic. Most toll stations are automatic and uses the signs above. The system involves the installation of a DSRC based radio transponder on the windscreen of a vehicle, and to sign an agreement with one of the toll collection companies in Norway. Tolls are charged at toll plazas and cars can drive past in over . The system is administrated by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. All public toll roads now use the electronic toll collection system. Each Autopass unit contains a microcontroller which will process requests from the road side, and respond with the proper information to the road side. There are 5 generations of cryptographic key pairs inside each Autopass unit, which are unique for each unit. The cryptographic keys are used for authenticating the unit when passing a toll plaza, thus making it difficult to make fraudulent copies of an Autopass unit. Unlike similar DSRC based tolling systems used in many countries, there is no access control in the Norwegian system, the unique ID within the unit being available for those who have the proper DSRC equipment. There is an internal storage space for 100 log entries, which are normally updated each time a vehicle owner is charged when passing a toll plaza. This is a collection of receipt entries which includes the time, date, and the station identity of the toll plaza which did the tolling transaction. Each Autopass unit features a move detect mechanism. When the unit is removed from the windscreen, an electrical switch will be activated, causing a flag to be set in a processor within the Autopass unit. This flag will be registered when doing a tolling transaction the next time the unit passes a toll plaza. Obligatory tag for heavy vehicles As of 1 January 2015 it is compulsory for all vehicles over which are registered to an enterprise, state, county, or municipal administration, or which are otherwise primarily used for business purposes, to have an electronic toll payment tag when driving in Norway. The provision has its legal basis in regulations that were adopted on 10 October 2014. It applies to all above-mentioned Norwegian and foreign vehicles on the entire public road network. Failure to carry a toll payment tag will result in a fine of 8,000 NOK. Failure to pay within three weeks means that the penalty charge will be increased to 12,000 NOK. If you are stopped twice without a tag within a period of two years, you will be fined 16,000 NOK.Obligatory tag for heavy vehicles Supporting toll plazas ; ;Toll rings *Oslo and Akershus *Kristiansand *Nord-J√¶ren *Haugalandet *Bergen *Ask√∏y *Namsos *Bod√∏ *Harstad *Grenland *F√∏rde *Trondheim ; ;Public roads *E6 Helgeland nord *E6 Helgeland s√∏r *E6 Trondheim‚ÄìStj√∏rdal *E6 Tingberg *E6 24x24pxSvinesund Bridge *E6 Moss *E6 Raukerud, √òstfoldpakka *E6 Gardermoen-Moelv, Akershus *E6 Frya-Sjoa, Oppland *E6 24x24pxH√•logaland Bridge *E6/E10 Tr√¶ldal - Leirvik, Nordland *E16 Bolstad, Hordaland *E16 Kongsvinger- Slomarka, Hedmark *E16 F√∏nhus-Bagn, Oppland *E18 √òstfoldpakka, √òstfold *E18 Vestfold (Gulli-Sky) *E39 Handeland, Vest-Agder *E134 24x24pxStordalstunnelen, √Ökrafjorden, Hordaland *E136 24x24pxTresfjord Bridge and 24x24pxV√•gstrand Tunnel, M√∏re og Romsdal *Rv4 Lunner grense, Oppland *Rv 7 Sokna-√òrgenvika, Buskerud *Rv13 24x24pxHardanger Bridge, Hordaland *Rv13 Svelgane, Hordaland *Rv36 Ullevik, Telemark *Rv 80 Nordland *Fv7 Kvammapakken, Hordaland *Fv16 Lunner grense, Oppland *Fv 17 Tverlandet - God√∏ystraumen, Nordland *Fv 33 Langsletta, Oppland *Fv 34 Grime, Oppland *Fv43 Kollevoll *Fv45 Gjesdal, Rogaland *Fv47 24x24pxT-Link, Rogaland *Fv78 Vegpakke Helgeland, Nordland *Fv107 24x24pxJondal Tunnel *Fv108 24x24pxKr√•ker√∏yforbindelsen, √òstfold *Fv118 24x24pxThe old Svinesund Bridge *Fv128 √òstfoldpakka *Fv163 Around Tresfjorden, M√∏re og Romsdal *Fv175 Kongsvinger-Slomarka, Hedmark *Fv250 Kongsvinger- Slomarka, Hedmark *Fv255 Gausdalsvegen, Oppland *Fv311 Kambo, √òstfoldpakka, √òstfold *Fv312 Frya-Sjoa *Fv312 Skarsmoen, Oppland *Fv315 Lundg√•rd, Gausdalsvegen, Oppland *Fv465 Gjervollstad, Vest-Agder *Fv519 24x24pxFinn√∏ytunnelen *Fv542 B√∏mlopakken, Hordaland *Fv544 Halsn√∏ysambandet, Hordaland *Fv714 Laksevegen *Fv 715 Krinsvatn *Fv858 24x24pxRya Tunnel ;Former *T√∏nsberg Toll Ring *E6 Grillstad‚ÄìV√¶rnes *E6 Trondheim ‚Äì Stj√∏rdal *E16 Hadelandsvegen *E18 Buskerud *E18 Vestfold Nord *E18 Agder *E39 Rennes√∏y Fixed Link *E39 Triangle Link *E39 √òysand‚ÄìThamshavn *E134 24x24pxOslofjord Tunnel *Rv4 Oppland *Rv 9 Setesdal *Rv19 Skoppum, Horten, Vestfold *Rv55 24x24pxFatla tunnel *Fv71 24x24pxSykkylven Bridge *Fv108 24x24pxHvaler Tunnel *Fv551 24x24pxFolgefonna tunnel *Fv562 24x24pxAsk√∏y Bridge *Fv566 24x24pxOster√∏y Bridge *Fv661 24x24pxStraumsbrua  See also Toll roads in Norway * Dedicated Short Range Communications External links English version of Official site * More information about Autopass References Road transport in Norway Electronic toll collection Toll roads in Norway ","title":"Autopass"},{"id":"1846019","text":"Johnny is an English language personal name.

Invention and design People demonstrating a Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope at a sidewalk gathering The American astronomer and lens designer James Gilbert Baker first proposed a Cassegrain design for Bernhard Schmidt's Schmidt camera in 1940.The General History of Astronomy, Volume 2, Part 2, Cambridge University Press, 1984, page 177 The optical shop at Mount Wilson Observatory manufactured the first one during World War II as part of their research into optical designs for the military. Abrahams, P., The Mount Wilson Optical Shop during the Second World War, American Astronomical Society Meeting 205, #02.01; Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 36, p.1339 As in the Schmidt camera, this design uses a spherical primary mirror and a Schmidt corrector plate to correct for spherical aberration. In this Cassegrain configuration the convex secondary mirror acts as a field flattener and relays the image through the perforated primary mirror to a final focal plane located behind the primary. Some designs include additional optical elements (such as field flatteners) near the focal plane. The first large telescope to use the design was the James Gregory Telescope of 1962 at the University of St Andrews. As of 2018, the James Gregory Telescope is also recognised as the largest Schmidt-Cassegrain. The telescope is noted for its large field of view, up 60 times a full moon. Applications The Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain design is very popular with consumer telescope manufacturers because it combines easy-to-manufacture spherical optical surfaces to create an instrument with the long focal length of a refracting telescope with the lower cost per aperture of a reflecting telescope. The compact design makes it very portable for its given aperture, which adds to its marketability. Their high f-ratio means they are not a wide- field telescope like their Schmidt camera predecessor, but they are good for more narrow-field deep sky and planetary viewing. Derivative designs View of the corrector and primary mirror of a commercial Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain. While there are many variations, (both mirrors spherical, both mirrors aspherical, or one of each) they can be divided into two principal design forms: compact and non-compact. In the compact form, the corrector plate is located at or near the focus of the primary mirror. In the non-compact, the corrector plate remains at or near the center of curvature (twice the focal length) of the primary mirror. Typical examples of the compact design are Celestron and Meade Instruments commercial instruments, combining a fast primary mirror and a small, strongly curved secondary. This yields a very short tube length, at the expense of field curvature. Most compact designs from Meade and Celestron have a primary mirror with a focal ratio of f/2 and a secondary with a focal ratio of f/5 yielding a system focal ratio of f/10. One notable exception is the Celestron C9.25, which has a primary focal ratio of f/2.3 and a secondary focal ratio of f/4.3, the result being a slightly flatter field and a slightly longer tube aspect ratio than most other compact designs. Non-compact designs keep the corrector at the center of curvature of the primary mirror. One very well-corrected design example would be the concentric (or monocentric) Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain, where all the mirror surfaces and the focal surface are concentric to a single point: the center of curvature of the primary. Optically, non-compact designs often yield better aberration correction and a flatter field than a compact design, but at the expense of longer tube length.

She is recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church, and is inscribed in the General Roman Calendar for optional celebration throughout the Roman Rite, as a memorial on November 16. Life Little is known of the early life of Gertrude who was born on the Feast of the Epiphany, January 6, 1256, in Eisleben, Thuringia (within the Holy Roman Empire). At the age of four,Her biographer states \\"in her fifth year\\", leading some to misinterpret this as being when she was five years old. See Alexandra Barrett, 'Introduction', in Gertrud the Great of Helfta, The Herald of God's Loving-Kindness: Books One and Two, (Kalamazoo, 1991), p10 she entered the monastery school at St. Mary at Helfta (with much debate having occurred as to whether this monastery is best described as Benedictine or Cistercian),This has been a point of some contention in twentieth-century studies of Gertrude. The best answer is that, technically, Helfta was a Benedictine monastery, but one which was strongly influenced by the Cistercian reform; this reflects the lack of clear-cut distinctions between the Orders at this time. Helfta, like many other monasteries of nuns following the Rule of St Benedict, was very much influenced by the Cistercian customs (and was in fact founded in 1258 by a group of nuns from Halberstadt who had adopted Cistercian customs). However, it was not, and could not, have been officially Cistercian, because in 1228 the General Chapter of Citeaux had forbidden the acceptance of any more monasteries of nuns into their Order, since the monks were already overburdened by the number of nuns under their care. Helfta, therefore, could not have been officially Cistercian. It is clear, though, that Helfta's customs seem to have been those of Citeaux, and certainly the works of Bernard of Clairvaux were extremely influential at Helfta. It is unclear whether the nuns wore a black 'Benedictine' or white 'Cistercian' habit, but interesting to note that both Gertrude and Mechtilde are almost universally represented in black. The spiritual directors of the monastery were neither Benedictines nor Cistercians, but Dominicans. See Sr Maximilian Marnau, 'Introduction', in Gertrude of Helfta, The Herald of Divine Love, (New York: Paulist Press, 1993), p10; Caroline Bynum Walker, Jesus as Mother, (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1982), pp174-5. under the direction of its abbess, Gertrude of Hackeborn. It is speculated that she was offered as a child oblate to the Church by devout parents. Given that Gertrude implies in the Herald that her parents were long dead at the time of writing,Herald, Book 2, chapter 16 however, it is also possible that she entered the monastery school as an orphan. Gertrude was confided to the care of Mechtilde, younger sister of the Abbess Gertrude, and joined the monastic community in 1266. It is clear from her own writings that she received a thorough education in a range of subjects. She, and the nun who authored Books 1 and 3-5 of the Herald, are thoroughly familiar with Scripture, the Church Fathers such as Augustine and Gregory the Great, and also more contemporary spiritual writers such as Richard and Hugh of St Victor, William of St Thierry, and Bernard of Clairvaux. Moreover, Gertrude's writing demonstrates that she was well-versed in rhetoric, and her Latin is very fluent.Sr Maximilian Marnau, 'Introduction', in Gertrude of Helfta, The Herald of Divine Love, (New York: Paulist Press, 1993), p6 In 1281, at the age of 25, she experienced the first of a series of visionsThis is described in Herald 1.1 and 2.1 that continued throughout her life, and which changed the course of her life. Her priorities shifted away from secular knowledge and toward the study of Scripture and theology. Gertrude devoted herself strongly to personal prayer and meditation, and began writing spiritual treatises for the benefit of her monastic sisters. Gertrude became one of the great mystics of the 13th century. Together with her friend and teacher Mechtilde, she practiced a spirituality called \\"nuptial mysticism,\\" that is, she came to see herself as the bride of Christ.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media Gertrude died at Helfta, near Eisleben, Saxony, around 1302. Her feast day is celebrated on November 16, but the exact date of her death is unknown; the November date stems from a confusion with Abbess Gertrude of Hackeborn. Works Gertrud von Helfta, Merazhofen Pfarrkirche Chorgest√ºhl Gertrude produced numerous writings, though only some survive today. The longest survival is the Legatus Memorialis Abundantiae Divinae Pietatis (known in English today as The Herald of Divine Love or The Herald of God's Loving-Kindness, and sometimes previously known as Life and Revelations), partly written by other nuns. There also remains her collection of Spiritual Exercises. A work known as Preces Gertrudianae (Gertrudian Prayers) is a later compilation, made up partly of extracts from the writings of Gertrude and partly of prayers composed in her style. It is also very possible that Gertrude was the author of a part of the revelations of Mechthild of Hackeborn, the Book of Special Grace. The Herald is composed of five books. Book 2 forms the core of the work, and was written by Gertrude herself; she states that she began the work on Maundy Thursday 1289. Books 3, 4, and 5 were written by another nun, or possibly more than one, during Gertrude's lifetime and probably at least in part at her dictation. Book 1 was written shortly before or after Gertrude's death as an introduction to the whole collection; it is possible it was written by Gertrude's confessor, but far more likely that the author was another Helfta nun.Sr Maximilian Marnau, 'Introduction', in Gertrude of Helfta, The Herald of Divine Love, (New York: Paulist Press, 1993), p12. Sr. Marnau suggests that Book 1 was written after Gertrude's death. Alezandra Barrett suggests that the absence of mention of Gertrude's death in Book 1 implies it was possibly written before her death. See Alexandra Barrett, 'Introduction', in Gertrud the Great of Helfta, The Herald of God's Loving-Kindness: Books One and Two, (Kalamazoo, 1991), p17 The importance of the Spiritual Exercises extends to the present day because they are grounded in the themes and rites of Catholic Liturgy for occasions of Baptism, conversion, commitment, discipleship, union with God, praise of God, and preparation for death. Gertrude's Spiritual Exercises can still be used by anyone who seeks to deepen spirituality through prayer and meditation. Devotion to the Sacred Heart One of the most esteemed woman saints of the Christian West, she was a notable early devotee of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Book 2 of the Herald of Divine Love is notable within the history of Christian devotion because its vivid descriptions of Gertrude's visions show a considerable elaboration on the long-standing but ill-defined veneration of Christ's Heart. This veneration was present in the belief that Christ's Heart poured forth a redemptive Fountain through the Wound in His side, an image culminating in its most famous articulation by Bernard of Clairvaux in his commentary on the Song of Songs. The women of Helfta‚ÄîGertrude foremost, who surely knew Bernard's commentary, and to a somewhat lesser extent the two Mechthilds, Mechthild of Magdeburg and Mechthild of Hackeborn‚Äîmade this devotion central to their mystical visions. Gertrude had a vision on the Feast of John the Evangelist. She was resting her head near the Wound in the Savior's Side and hearing the Beating of the Divine Heart. She asked John if on the night of the Last Supper he had felt these Pulsations, why he had never spoken of the fact. John replied that this revelation had been reserved for subsequent ages when the world, having grown cold, would have need of it to rekindle its love., Mark W. Lynn Phd, Mark W., \\"History of the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\\", Knights of Columbus-Florida State Council Later reputation and influence After her death, Gertrude's works seem to have vanished almost without trace. Only five manuscripts of the Herald have survived, the earliest one being written in 1412, and only two of these manuscripts are complete. With the invention of printing, Gertrude became far more prominent, with Latin, Italian and German editions being published in the sixteenth century. She was popular in seventeenth-century France, where her trust in and burning love for God were potent antidotes to Jansenism. Philip Neri and Francis de Sales both used her prayers and recommended them to others. In Spain, Bishop Diego of Tarragona, the confessor to Philip II, read the revelations of Gertrude aloud to the king as he lay dying in the Escorial. Her works were also popular with the Discalced Carmelites in the sixteenth century. Francisco Ribera, the confessor to Teresa of √Åvila, recommended that she take Gertrude as spiritual mistress and guide. More recently, Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger, the restorer of Benedictine monasticism in France, was influenced by Gertrude. His Congregation of Solesmes was responsible for most of the work done on Gertrude in the nineteenth century. Veneration Saint Gertrude by Miguel Cabrera, 1763 Gertrude was never formally canonized, but a liturgical office of prayer, readings, and hymns in her honor was approved by Rome in 1606. The Feast of St. Gertrude was extended to the Catholic Church by Clement XII and today is celebrated on November 16, the date of her death. Some religious communities, including the Benedictines, celebrate her feast on November 17. Pope Benedict XIV gave her the title \\"the Great\\" to distinguish her from Abbess Gertrude of Hackeborn and to recognize the depth of her spiritual and theological insight. Gertrude showed \\"tender sympathy towards the souls in purgatory\\" and urged prayers for them. She is therefore invoked for suffering souls in purgatory. The following prayer is attributed to St. Gertrude, and is often depicted on her prayer card: Perhaps for that reason, her name has been attached to a prayer that, according to a legend of uncertain origin and date (neither are found in the Revelations of Saint Gertrude the Great), Christ promised to release a thousand souls from purgatory each time it was said; despite the fact that practices relative to alleged promises to free one or more souls from purgatory by the recitation of some prayer were prohibited by Pope Leo XIII. Nonetheless, the material that is found in her Revelations, such as the celebration of Gregorian Masses for the departed, is well in line with the devotions approved by the Catholic Church. Patronage In compliance with a petition from King Philip IV of Spain she was declared Patroness of the West Indies; in Peru her feast is celebrated with great pomp, and in New Mexico the town Santa Gertrudis de lo de Mora was built in her honor and bears her name. LegacyIn subsequent centuries, Gertrude the Great was often confused with the abbess of St Mary at Helfta, Gertrude of Hackeborn; as a result, she is often incorrectly depicted in art holding a crosier. * The Monastery of St. Gertrude in Cottonwood, Idaho, is home to a community of about 50 professed Benedictine nuns. *Parishes are dedicated to St. Gertrude in Washington, Missouri; Cincinnati, Ohio; Kingsville, Texas; Woodstock, New Brunswick, Canada; and Chicago, Illinois. *Saint Gertrude High School is a Catholic college preparatory day school for young women in grades 9-12 in Richmond, Virginia. *Saint Gertrude Church in Firies, Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland. *Saint Gertrude the Great Catholic School (TK-8th Grade) and Parish in Bell Gardens, California.

Ettlingen is the second largest town in the district of Karlsruhe, after Bruchsal. Alb River in Ettlingen Geography Ettlingen is situated at the northern edge of the Black Forest on the Upper Rhine Plain. The Alb River arises in the hills of the Black Forest and flows through Ettlingen before emptying into the Rhine at Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, making Ettlingen a central feature of the Albtal, the Alb Valley. Central Ettlingen and its largest constituent communities (Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, Oberweier) lie on the plain itself, but some of the villages (Spessart, Sch√∂llbronn, and Schluttenbach) are nestled among the northernmost foothills of the Black Forest. = Neighbouring communities = The municipality of Ettlingen is bordered by the following communities, clockwise from the north: Karlsruhe, Waldbronn, Karlsbad (Baden), Marxzell, Malsch, and Rheinstetten, all of which belong to the district of Karlsruhe, except for the independent city of Karlsruhe itself. = Constituent communities = Since the major communal reforms enacted by Baden-W√ºrttemberg in the early 1970s, the municipality of Ettlingen has consisted of the town of Ettlingen itself and the communities of Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, Oberweier, Schluttenbach, Sch√∂llbronn, and Spessart. History Ettlingen was an important crossroads during Roman times, when the region was part of the province of Germania Superior. This is demonstrated by the many artifacts found in the area, including the \\"Neptune Stone,\\" which commemorates a flood of the Rhine, and the remains of a Roman bath excavated beneath St. Martin's Church. The town was first mentioned in 788 as \\"Ediningom\\" in a deed of donation belonging to Weissenburg Abbey in Alsace (now in France). In 965, the village of Ettlingen (\\"Ediningom\\") received market rights (Marktrecht) from Emperor Otto the Great. In 1192, Emperor Henry VI, one of Frederick Barbarossa's sons. Margrave Herman V of Baden-Baden became Ettlingen's feudal lord in 1219. In the following centuries, Ettlingen developed into an important administrative centre within the Margraviate of Baden-Baden. Ettlingen gave its name to a line of defensive earthworks known as the Ettlingen Line built to deter French aggression. During the Nine Years' War the town was nearly completely burned to the ground by the troops of Louis XIV, but was nevertheless rebuilt in the following decades under Margravine Sibylle Auguste. After the Catholic line of Baden- Baden died out in 1771, Ettlingen passed to the Protestant Margraviate of Baden-Durlach, which would become the reunited Margraviate of Baden. During the French Revolutionary Wars, Ettlingen was the site of a battle between elements of the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle and the Habsburg Army of the Upper Rhine on 9 July 1796.Smith, Digby (1998). The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill. p. 111. . In the period of Napoleon's activities in Germany, Margrave Karl Friedrich of Baden was made Elector in 1806 and Grand Duke in 1806. Ettlingen remained an independent town until 1937, when it was incorporated into the administrative unit that would become the district of Karlsruhe in 1939. Ettlingen and its surrounding villages and land continue to be part of this district. In 1966, Ettlingen passed the 20,000 population mark and raised to the status of Gro√üe Kreisstadt by the state government of Baden- W√ºrttemberg. During the communal reforms of the early 1970s, several smaller communities were incorporated into Ettlingen, raising the population to over 30,000. Ettlingen's renowned open-air theater series, the Schlossfestspiele first took the stage in the Baroque inner courtyard of Ettlingen Palace in 1979. = Religions= Ettlingen was originally a part of the ancient Diocese of Speyer and was under the pastoral care of the Archdeacon of St. German and Moritz in Speyer. The town originally belonged to the deanery of Durlach but was itself made archdeaconate in the 16th century. The Protestant Reformation made gains in Ettlingen as early as 1520, but the town remained mostly Catholic, and the town's Catholic majority was supported by the Catholic line of Baden-Baden; later, starting in 1624, the Jesuits played an active role in converting many of the town's inhabitants back to the Catholic faith. By the beginning of the 19th century, Protestants were a small minority. St. Martin's Church (Martinskirche) During the period of secularization following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Ettlingen was part of the ordinariate of Bruchsal. In 1821, it became part of the newly founded Archdiocese of Freiburg, and the town was made the seat of a deanery, which included not only the parishes within Ettlingen proper, but also those in surrounding villages and neighboring municipalities. Today, Ettlingen belongs to the deanery of Karlsruhe, with the various parishes organized into pastoral units (Seelsorgeeinheiten). These include Ettlingen Stadt, with the parishes Herz Jesu (Sacred Heart), Liebfrauen (Our Lady), and St. Martin's, the town's oldest church; Ettlingen South, with St. Dionysius' in Ettlingenweier, St. Wendelin's in Oberweier, and St. Joseph's in Bruchhausen; and Ettlingen Heights, with St. George's in V√∂lkersbach, St. Boniface's in Sch√∂llbronn, and St. Anthony's in Spessart, although V√∂lkersbach belongs politically to the municipality of Malsch. Jewish families lived in Ettlingen since at least the 17th century. They lived primarily in F√§rbergasse ('Dyers' Alley), which was formerly known as \\"Judengasse\\" (Jews' Alley). Ettlingen's first synagogue was built on Albstra√üe in 1849, only to be torn down again when a new synagogue was built on Pforzheimerstra√üe and dedicated in 1889. The \\"New Synagogue\\" was itself destroyed during the infamous Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938. Most of the remaining Jewish citizens of Ettlingen were deported soon thereafter as part of the Nazi \\"Final Solution.\\" Protestants (Lutherans), most of whom had moved to Ettlingen since the early 19th century, were first administered from R√ºppurr, but in 1848 they received their own clergyman, and in 1869 their own parish (Johannesgemeinde - Congregation of St. John), which soon got its own church, the oldest Protestant church in Ettlingen. The Johannesgemeinde belonged to the city deanery of Karlsruhe at first, but was later transferred over to the deanery of Alb-Pfinz with its seat in Pfinztal. The congregation continued to grow and was eventually divided in 1951, creating the Paulusgemeinde (Congregation of St. Paul). The Paulusgemeinde had a parish hall built in 1953, adding a bell tower in 1965. The Paulusgemeinde was split up in 1972 to create the Luthergemeinde (Luther Congregation), which caters to the Protestants of Ettlingen West, Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, and Oberweier. From 1969 to 2003, Ettlingen was the seat of the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church in Baden's district of Central Baden. However, in the wake of efforts to save money, this district was dissolved and Ettlingen incorporated into the district of North Baden. Alongside the two major churches, there are also a few free churches and congregations, including a Free Evangelical congregation and the Liebenzell Congregation. The Jehovah's Witnesses, the New Apostolic Church, and a small Jewish community are also represented in Ettlingen.

Gothic influence is seen in tying shawls and kerchiefs on the head. Fine pleats and gathered lace collars typify the Renaissance era. From Baroque bell-shaped skirts to delicate Slavic patterns, these folk costumes show the complex growth of Czech and Slovak traditions. Kroje had many regional variants with typical decorations and/or colours. There are three basic types of kroje: # the simple one, used in everyday life that looks very similar in all regions. # the celebration one, used for Sunday masses, feasts etc. - these are the decorative ones you often see on pictures. # the wedding one - used only when you were a bride or a groom. As it was not reasonable to have a one-purpose clothing, it was often a celebration one upgraded by typical wedding accessories. Kroje are not worn by people in Czech and Slovak republics anymore, only during feasts people use them as a living tradition. Kroje started being replaced by \\"town\\" clothing during 19th century: it started in bigger cities and towns and villages followed. It was quicker in Bohemia and industrial regions and of course for male clothing, so on the old photos you can see a father in a suit, but a mother (and possibly children) in a local costume (kroj). The last regions where kroje were worn on everyday or almost everyday basis were regions near the border between Moravia and Slovakia - Slov√°cko, Hor≈à√°cko, Vala≈°sko - where you could meet esp. old women wearing kroje even in the second half of 20th century.

It is nearly five times as long as its predecessor and the writing style is pitched at a more mature audience. The scope of the novel is vast; it is divided into six parts and the illustrations are also more sophisticated. It won the Newbery Medal for 1923. It was one of the novels in the series that was adapted into the 1967 film Doctor Dolittle. Plot The novel begins when Tommy Stubbins, the narrator of the story, finds a squirrel injured by a hawk. Matthew Mugg, the cat's meat man, informs him to get help from Doctor Dolittle, who can speak the language of animals. The Doctor is away on a voyage, but when he returns, he attends to the squirrel. Tommy is introduced to some of the strange animals in Dolittle's care, such as the Wiff-Waff fish, and those who care for his household, such as Dab-Dab the duck, and Jip the dog. Polynesia the parrot arrives in Puddleby from Africa informs the Doctor that Bumpo is studying in Bullford. Tommy begins his studies with Dolittle, or rather with Polynesia who teaches Tommy the language of animals. Chee-Chee comes from Africa disguised as a lady and tells about his voyage to Puddleby. The Doctor acquires The Curlew and is thinking of taking Tommy, Polynesia, and Luke the Hermit. They find out from the hermit's dog, Bob, that he was sent to prison for murder but Bob is a witness so when the court is in the process the Doctor proves to the judge that he can talk to animals when this is settled he translates Bob's story to English. When the story is finished the judges conclude that the hermit is innocent. Later, the Purple Bird of Paradise informs the Doctor that Long Arrow, son of Golden Arrow, who is a friend of the Doctor, is missing so after they play the game Blind Travel, which would determine where in the world they would voyage, they decide to take a trip to Spider Monkey Island to find Long Arrow. The Doctor, Tommy, Bumpo, and Polynesia start the voyage across the sea but on the way they discover some stowaways and drop them off at Penzance. Their first stop is in the Capa Blanca islands of Spain; the Doctor makes a deal with the bullfighters that if he can beat them in a fight they would stop bullfighting. Bumpo makes a side bet of 3000 pesetas that the Doctor will win. The Doctor talks to the bulls and they agreed to stick to the plan to make everyone think that he outwitted them. When the fight is over and the doctor wins against the other bullfighters, the crew set off again the Doctor shows Tommy he has caught a fidgit that talks English so he consults it and realizes that if he goes deeper, he will find the Great Glass Sea Snail. Afterwards there is a storm that wrecks the ship leaving Tommy alone; the Purple Bird of Paradise tells him that his friends are on Spider Monkey Island so with the help of the porpoises Tommy reaches the island and the crew. Dolittle finds out from catching a Jabizri, a rare beetle, that Long Arrow is stuck inside Hawk's Head Mountain so they try to find an opening but fail so they use the Jabizri to locate it. When they find a slab in the mountain they dig under it until it collapses and Long Arrow is free. The Doctor finds out from the people of the island that the island is going southward and is going to perish so the doctor gets some whales to push the island back to South America. After this the Doctor is told by the Popsipetels, the people of the island, that they will be attacked soon by their rivals the Bag-jagderags so the Doctor uses the birds of the island as well as the Popsipetels to battle them. The Doctor and his army win but the people then decide after so much he did for them that they would crown him king of their island. So for many months the doctor rules the island and makes good changes for the Popsipetels. Polynesia finds the Great Glass Sea Snail and brings her to Doolittle. He talks to the Great Glass Sea Snail and learns that it is because of the island colliding with South America that it ends up on the shores of Spider Monkey Island so the Doctor asks the snail to take him in his shell with his crew back to England. The Doctor abandons Spider Monkey Island and sets off with Polynesia, Tommy, Matthew, Chee-Chee and Jip and makes his journey through the ocean in the shell of the Great Glass Sea Snail. When they come back to England the Doctor and his crew go back to Puddleby in the doctor's house and Dub-Dub says they are just in time for tea.

Ecology P. palmata is to be found growing from mid-tide of the intertidal zone (the area between the high tide and low tide) to depths of 20 m or more in sheltered and exposed shores. Culinary use Dulse Dulse is commonly used as food and medicine in Ireland, Iceland, Atlantic Canada, and the Northeastern United States. It can be found in many health food stores or fish markets and can be ordered directly from local distributors. It is also used as fodder for animals in some countries. Dulse is a good source of minerals and vitamins compared with other vegetables, contains all trace elements needed by humans, and has a high protein content. Dulse contains iodine, which prevents goitre. It is commonly found from June to September and can be picked by hand when the tide is out. When picked, small snails, shell pieces, and other small particles can be washed or shaken off the plant, which is then spread to dry. Some gatherers may turn it once and roll it into large bales to be packaged later. Fresh dulse can be eaten directly off the rocks before sun-drying. Sun- dried dulse is eaten as is or is ground to flakes or a powder. When used in cooking, dulse's properties are similar to those of a flavour-enhancer. In Iceland, the tradition is to eat it with butter. It can be pan-fried quickly into chips, baked in the oven covered with cheese, with salsa, or simply microwaved briefly. It can be used in soups, chowders, sandwiches, and salads, or added to bread or pizza dough. Finely diced, it can be used as a flavour enhancer in meat dishes, such as chili, in place of monosodium glutamate. In Ireland dulse can be used to make \\"White Soda Bread\\".Allen, R. Coast Recipes inspired by Ireland's Wild Atlantic Coast p.155 HarperCollins In Ballycastle, Northern Ireland, it is traditionally sold at the Ould Lammas Fair. It is particularly popular along the Causeway Coast. Although a fast-dying tradition, many gather their own dulse. Along the Ulster coastline from County Down to County Donegal, it is eaten dried and uncooked as a snack. It is commonly referred to as dillisk on the west coast of Ireland. Dillisk is usually dried and sold as a snack food from stalls in seaside towns by periwinkle sellers. Velella velella & Palmaria palmata, Moonstone beach, Cambria, California Researchers at Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center have selected a fast-growing strain of Pacific dulse (P. mollis). Originally intended as a feed for abalone farming, they claim their strain of the seaweed tastes like bacon when fried.

Biography The Amateur Gentleman (1926) Born in Cripple Creek, Colorado, Lawson appeared on the Broadway stage as a child in The School Girl (1904). In 1924, Dunbar went to Hollywood, where she starred in several motion pictures, including her role as the heroine in The Amateur Gentleman (1926) opposite Richard Barthelmess, which attracted considerable attention for her. She was also the fourth actress who played Jane, starring in the 1927 version of the Tarzan story, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, opposite James Pierce, who played the title role. Also in the cast was Boris Karloff, who played a native named Owaza. Dunbar left the movies upon marrying her second husband, wealthy Minneapolis society man Thomas Bucklin Wells, II, who apparently acted in one movie himself, Ain't Love Funny? released in 1927 by Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). She is said to have had seven husbands, including theatrical producer Maurice (divorced); Thomas Wells (married October 1926-his death); South American millionaire Jaime De Garson (divorced 1931); boxer/actor Max Baer (married July 8, 1931-divorced 1933); portrait painter Tino Costa (married 1936 -annulled 1937); and Russell Lawson. She and Lawson had two sons, Richard and Russell. When Dunbar was preparing to divorce Tommy Wells, she received a cable from him to come to Paris, where he was dying. She rushed to his bedside in the French capital and forgave him. He died in her arms, having succumbed to drug addiction. She received a $2,500 monthly income from his estate. She divorced De Garson, whom she married in London, to marry Baer. She later styled herself as Dorothy Dunbar Wells. In 1936, she completed a book of poetry, but had not found enough nerve to send it to a publisher. She had long decided movies were behind her. Dunbar asked that her marriage to French husband Costa be annulled because he was \\"temperamental and cold.\\" In December 1937, she sued family members of her former husband, Wells, seeking $270,000 in trusts from his estate, because she said they had misrepresented certain papers they gave her to sign after his death. They told her, she said, the documents were to make certain the trusts were held for her, but she learned later the papers were actually waivers of her interest in the trusts. After marrying Lawson, her seventh husband, Dunbar went by the name Dorothy Wells Lawson. She played bridge and golf, and won some trophies. She died at age ninety in Seattle, Washington. Her memorial service was private by family. Filmography The Flaming Crisis (1924) (Mesco Productions) (Western) ... Tex Miller * The Masquerade Bandit (1926) (FBO) (Western) ...

Estoppel in English law is a doctrine that may be used in certain situations to prevent a person from relying upon certain rights, or upon a set of facts (e.g. words said or actions performed) which is different from an earlier set of facts. Estoppel could arise in a situation where a creditor informs a debtor that a debt is forgiven, but then later insists upon repayment. In a case such as this, the creditor may be estopped from relying on their legal right to repayment, as the creditor has represented that he no longer treats the debt as extant. A landlord may tell his tenant that he is not required to pay rent for a period of time (\\"you don't need to pay rent until the war is over\\"). Until the war is over, the landlord would be \\"estopped\\" from claiming rents during the war period. Estoppel is often important in insurance law, where some actions by the insurer or the agent estop the insurer from denying a claim. There are a huge array of different types of estoppel which can arise under English law. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasions that the link between them is often tenuous. Treitel on Contracts notes that \\"unconscionability ... provides the link between them.\\" But they nevertheless have \\"separate requirements and different terrains of application.\\"Treitel on Contracts, 14th ed. (2015) at 3-090. The courts have generally abandoned any attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle; in First National Bank plc v Thompson [1996] Ch 231 Lord Millett said: \\"the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by representation and that they are all governed by the same principle [has] never won general acceptance.\\"at 236 Reliance-based estoppels Under English law, estoppel by, promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel are regarded as 'reliance-based estoppels' by Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 16(2), 2003. Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise if and only if it would be \\"unconscionable\\" for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation (\\"it's not fair!\\"). Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defence, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action. The requirement of inducement and reliance are broadly the same for all reliance-based estoppels: *(i) the representor must have intended (actual or presumed) the representee, or have been reasonably understood by the representee as having intended him, to act on the relevant representation (or promise), *(ii) the form of reliance must have been reasonable or intended, and *(iii) the representation must have caused the representee to act in such a way that it would be \\"unconscionable\\" for the representor to resile. Detriment is measured at the time when the promisor proposes to withdraw his promise, not at the time when the promise is made. Estoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future). Proprietary estoppel can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under estoppel by representation of fact. English courts will consider unconscionability taking into account many factors, including the behaviour, state of mind, and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative (Michael Spence, Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel, Oxford: 1999, pp60‚Äì66): *how the promise/representation and reliance upon it were induced *the content of the promise/representation *relative knowledge of the parties *parties' relative interest in the relevant activities in reliance *nature and context of the parties' relationship *parties' relative strength of position *history of the parties' relationship *steps, if any, taken by the promisor/representor to ensure he has not caused preventible harm. =Estoppel by representation= Estoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as \\"common law estoppel by representation\\" in Halsbury's Laws of England, vol 16(2), 2003 reissue. In The Law relating to Estoppel Representation, 4th edition, 2004 at para I.2.2, Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows: A second definition can be found at Wilken and Villiers, The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel, 2nd ed, Oxford: 2003, at para 9.02: A representation can be made by statement or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account unconscionability under estoppel by representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.see Wilken and Villiers, para 9-03; The Commonwealth v Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 444 per Deane J. Lord Justice Lewison, in his judgment as to the circumstances obtaining at the time of the withdrawal of Employment Tribunal (ET) proceedings did not draw the conclusion that the appellant, Dr Srivatsa, intended to concede the merits of his claim when withdrawing his ET action. In allowing the appeal of Dr Srivatsa against a prior judgement of a cause of action or issue estoppel, and in respectful disagreement with the judge of first instance, he said that the effect of that judge's decision was that, in the words of Mummery LJ in the case ofSajid v Sussex Muslim Society, = Equitable estoppel = As noted above, under English law, promissory and proprietary estoppel are both species of equitable estoppel. Proprietary estoppel Proprietary estoppel arises when A purports to give but fails to effectively convey, or promises to give property or an interest in property, to B, while being generally aware (Crabb v Arun District Council[1976] Ch 179) that B will expend money or otherwise act to his detriment in reliance of the supposed or promised gift, so much so that it would be \\"unconscionable\\" not to enforce the expectation (Taylor Fashions v Liverpool Victoria Trustees).(1982) QB 133 For example, in Dillwyn v Llewelyn(1862) 4 De G.F.& J. 517 in Chancery a father promised a property to his son, who took possession, expended a large sum of money on the house and otherwise improved the property. The father never actually gifted the property to the son. After his death the son, claiming to be the equitable owner, obtained a court judgment forcing the trustees to convey the land to him. Similarly in Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29, a father encouraged his son to build a house on his own land, promising to leave that land to the son in his will. Subsequently, the son built a house and lived there for some 30 years. No transfer of land was made in the father's will when he died. It was held that despite this the personal representatives of the father were estopped from evicting the son. While the courts will generally uphold the expectations of parties, if the parties are themselves not clear about their expectations the court's starting point will be the detriment incurred by the parties (per Robert Walker LJ Jennings v Rice[2002] EWCA Civ 159). Proprietary estoppel claims, therefore do not necessarily result in the transfer of the property to the claimant; in Jennings v Rice itself, there was a monetary award. In June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, and in the process was quite fierce in describing its limits. In that light, it must be very doubtful that Mr Jennings would have got the result he did: properly understood, Jennings v Rice is a bit of a muddle, probably concerning promissory estoppel, with a bit of quantum meruit thrown in for good measure. In Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd[2008] UKHL 55 the House overturned the decision of a fairly heavy-weight Court of Appeal on the very issue of estoppel, thereby illustrating the level of confusion about the meaning of the doctrine. Lord Scott of Foscote, with whom the other Lords agreed, described at length that someone who seeks to rely on proprietary estoppel must establish an actual or certain interest in the property to which he claimed a right. Without that, he is not off the starting blocks. In particular he remarked that the following rationes of Deane J in Muschinski v Dodds(1985) 160 CLR 583 \\"repay careful reading\\" (his Lordship said they applied to proprietary estoppel as they do to constructive trusts): Lord Scott added, He then found that that was exactly what the Court of Appeal, no less, had done. Once the proprietary right is established, then and only then will the court consider the conduct of the party seeking to deny the right and if that conduct is wanting, will estop him from denying the right. The court should not begin with an examination of a party's behaviour. Promissory estoppel (contract law) Promissory estoppel is the doctrine that prevents a party from acting in a certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one pound in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule. The doctrine of Promissory Estoppel was first developed in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by Lord Denning in the leading case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd.[1947] KB 130 In this case, the claimants let a block of flats to the defendants at an annual rent of ¬£2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to ¬£1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during World War II. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At the end of the war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an obiter dictum that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been estopped from doing so even though no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this. Promissory estoppel requires (1) an unequivocal promise by words or conduct, (2) a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (not necessarily to their detriment), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is \\"a shield not a sword\\" ‚Äì it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In High Trees the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given. Estoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and is therefore discretionary. In the case of D & C Builders v Rees the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of ¬£300 on a debt of ¬£482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In Combe v Combe Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a \\"sword\\" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband. Promissory estoppel is not available when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in Pinnel's Case,(1602) 5 Co Rep 117a and affirmed in Foakes v Beer.(1884) 9 App Cas 605 This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the recent decision of Collier v Wright Ltd.[2007] EWCA Civ 1329 Note that Promissory Estoppel should not be confused with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably. Yet proprietary estoppel has also arisen by acquiescence. The leading case in this area is Ramadan v Dyson (1866) LR 1 HL 129. = Estoppel by acquiescence = A legally binding contract occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance from the other party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration is concerned with the bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: ‚ÄúA valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other\\". The doctrine of consideration can therefore be seen as a set of rules, which play the principal role in the decision by the courts as to which agreements or promises are found to be legally binding. Promissory estoppel is a term used in contract law that applies where there may not otherwise be an enforceable contract. The importance of promissory estoppel in contract law is that it has enabled legal obligations, which fall into the category of contract law but fail to show any consideration, to be argued for. Promissory estoppel provides a way in which promises can be legally binding even if no consideration has been given. Promissory estoppel relates to a form of future conduct. The doctrine of promissory estoppel may not make the total contract fully enforceable. The specific facts in the case must actually establish the elements of promissory estoppel before the contract becomes enforceable in law. The promises within a contract will be enforced under the promissory estoppel doctrine, when enforcing the contract promises avoids injustice. Lord Justice Denning is a leading figure in the field of promissory estoppel in the case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130 (the High Trees case), was concerned with the modification of the rent payable on a block of flats during the Second World War. The importance of the case, however, lies in an obiter statement of principle which Denning LJ set out, ‚Äúa promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply‚Äù. Applying this principle, Denning held that a promise to accept a lower rent during the war years was binding on the landlord, regardless of the fact that the tenant had supplied no consideration for it. There are limitations which must be satisfied to this doctrine which derived from both Lord Cairns in the case Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877) 2 AC 439 and Denning LJ in the High Trees case. They are: # There must be a promise # There must be a clear promise intended to alter the contracted obligation. The court assesses intention objectively rather than taking evidence on the party's state of mind. Woodhouse Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Produce Marketing Board [1972] AC 741 held that a contract for the sale of some coffee beans was agreed to be payable in pound sterling. The sellers mistakenly sent an invoice stating price was payable in Nigerian pounds. At the time the value of sterling and Nigerian pounds was equal. The buyers accepted the delivery and invoice without objection. Subsequently the value of the pound fell quite dramatically in relation to Nigerian pounds. The buyers then sought to revert to pound sterling as stated in the contract. The buyers conduct in accepting the invoice unquestionably amounted to an implied clear and unambiguous promise to accept on those terms.  The doctrine can only be used as a ‚Äòshield not a sword‚Äô  The full force application of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to ‚Äúuse it as a shield and not as a sword‚Äù restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not to be used as a cause of action against another. In Combe v Combe [1951] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: \\"The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them\\". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC [1975] QB 917, here the courts held \\"that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action.\\" Early cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for Employment v Globe Elastic Thread Co Ltd [1980] AC 506. The promise or representation must be ‚Äúprecise‚Äù and ‚Äúunambiguous‚Äù although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‚Äòwaiver‚Äô has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. In Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a \\"promise\\" as such, but merely an \\"understanding\\". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to \\"relief against forfeiture\\" cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases. This case was the one on which Denning placed considerable reliance in the High Trees case. It never applied to situations of part payment of debts, however, under the modern law the concept of waiver has been effectively considered within \\"promissory estoppel\\".  Contractual / Legal relationship  It remains unsettled whether promissory estoppel may arise in pre-contractual relationships. In the case Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr [1979] 2 All ER 753 CA, a landlord made an oral promise to his tenants that if they bought a 99 year lease to their flats he would repair the roofs of the flats at his own expense. After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof at a cost of ¬£15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that promissory estoppel may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in Durham Fancy Goods v Michael Jackson [1969] 2 QB 839, where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is ‚Äúa pre-existing legal relationship which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties‚Äù.  Detrimental reliance on the representation  The proof of possible detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor is allowed to revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position as a result of relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr & Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion in the evolution of the doctrine.  Temporary suspension of contractual obligations and rights  This doctrine does not operate to completely extinguish the original rights of the parties accruing from the contract. It only provides for the suspension of such right, which can subsequently be revived after certain event or time. In Tool Metal Manufacturing v Tungsten [1955] 1 WLR 761 HL, The courts held that generally promissory estoppel will merely suspend legal rights rather than extinguish them. However, where periodic payments are involved and a promise has been made to reduce the payments because of pressing circumstances which are not likely to persist, promissory estoppel can be used to extinguish legal rights. This final limitation to the scope of estoppel operates in the sense that the doctrine applies to representations relating to past and present events only by excluding the future events executory promise. However, promissory estoppel may permanently extinguish the rights of the promisor to claim lump sum after part-payment. In D & C Builders v Rees [1965] 2 QB 617, Lord Denning expressed that the: To conclude, the above limitations help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined with the use of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.  Other estoppels  =Contractual estoppel= The law relating to contractual estoppel was summarised in : =Issue estoppel = The civil law use of issue estoppel or res judicata (literally translated as \\"the fact has been decided\\") is relatively uncontroversial. It expresses a general public interest that the same issue should not be litigated more than once even when the parties are different. The criminal law application, called double jeopardy provides that a person should not be tried twice for the same offence. A notable case occurred as a result of the Birmingham Six case where the House of Lords ruled in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police(1982) that issue estoppel applied. Lord Diplock said: =Other estoppels= Estoppel in pais (literally ‚Äúby act of notoriety\\", or \\"solemn formal act‚Äù) is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. Estoppel in pais and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American legal parlance. * Estoppel by convention as understood in English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract based on a shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same. It has been said that estoppel by convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel or proprietary estoppel, though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation. * Estoppel by deed is a rule of evidence. A statement in a deed, usually facts stated in the recital of a deed, is evidentially conclusive against the parties of the deed. The parties are estopped from asserting otherwise.

Paris, 1836 Fanny Elssler as Sarah Campbell in the ballet 'La Gypsy', performed at Her Majesty's Theatre in London in 1839 Fanny Elssler dancing in La Voli√®re, a now-forgotten ballet by her sister Therese Elssler. Fanny Elssler (born Franziska El√üler; 23 June 181027 November 1884) was an Austrian ballerina of the Romantic Period.  Life and career  She was born in Gumpendorf, a neighborhood of Vienna. Her father Johann Florian Elssler was a second generation employee of Nikolaus I, Prince Esterh√°zy. Both Johann and his brother Josef were employed as copyists to the Prince's Kapellmeister, Joseph Haydn. Johann was to eventually become valet to Haydn and attended Haydn up to and was present at Haydn's death. From her earliest years she was trained for the ballet, and made her appearance at the K√§rntnertortheater in Vienna before she was 7. She almost invariably danced with her sister Therese, who was 2 years her senior; the sisters studied dancing with Jean-Pierre Aumer and Friedrich Horschelt beginning when Fanny was 9 years old, also traveling to Naples to study with Gaetano Gioja. After some years' experience together in Vienna, the sisters went in 1827 to Naples. While there, she had an affair with Leopold, Prince of Salerno, the son of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, which resulted in the birth of a son, Franz. Their success in Naples, to which Fanny contributed more than her sister, led to an engagement in Berlin in 1830. This was the beginning of a series of triumphs for Fanny's personal beauty and skill in dancing. After captivating all hearts in Berlin and Vienna, and inspiring the aged statesman Friedrich von Gentz with a remarkable passion, she paid a visit to London, where she received much kindness at the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Grote, who practically adopted the little girl who was born three months after the mother's arrival in England. In September 1834 Elssler appeared with the Ballet du Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Musique (today known as the Paris Opera Ballet), a step to which she looked forward with much misgiving on account of Marie Taglioni's supremacy on that stage. However, Elssler and Taglioni were exceptionally different dancers, and the Opera's management saw this as an opportunity to incite some controversy by hiring Elssler. Taglioni was known as a , represented by the lightness of her leaps and jumps. Elssler, on the other hand, distinguished her dancing with the precision in which she performed small, quick steps. Elssler's type of dancing was known as . The results of her performances, however, were another triumph for Elssler, and the temporary eclipse of Taglioni. Taglioni, although the finer artist of the two, could not for the moment compete with the newcomer's personal fascination. It was conspicuous in her performance of the Spanish Cachucha (from the 1836 Coralli/Gide ballet ) that Elssler outshone all rivals. Elssler was not Spanish, but her performances of the Cachucha were filled with fire and sensual life. The poet Th√©ophile Gautier titled her the \\"pagan\\" dancer because of her performances in the Cachucha, juxtaposed with Taglioni, the \\"Christian\\" dancer. The success of Elssler and the Cachucha led to a widespread demand for more choreographed ballet dances of specific national flavor. These types of dances became very popular, and Elssler herself added a Polish ' (Krakowiak) and an Italian tarantella to her repertoire. Her image was often identified with pink satin and black lace as the fleshy, sensuous Spanish dancer, in stark contrast to depictions of Taglioni as the modest sylph in white. Elssler did not only possess technical gifts, her ability to perform dramatically was exceptional. Her performances of the great Romantic ballets, including La Sylphide, Giselle and La Esmeralda, portrayed heightened aspects of their former characters. This earned Elssler a place among the most talented and notable ballerinas of the Romantic ballet period. In 1840 she sailed with her sister for New York for a tour arranged by Henry Wikoff, and after two years of unmixed success they returned to Europe.Princeton University Henry Wikoff Collection 1836‚Äì1884 While in New York City, Fanny dined with and was escorted by John Van Buren, son of the President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. In Washing D.C., Congress closed so that no one need miss Elssler's performance. Elssler is considered by Lillian Moore to have been \\"the most illustrious Sylphide ever to dance the role in America\\", with the final scene bringing many audience members to tears. At the St Charles Theater in New Orleans, Elssler was contracted for two weeks at $1,000 for ever night that she danced. During the following five years Fanny appeared in Germany, Austria, France, England, and Russia. In 1845, she was invited to perform along with her rivals Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi and Fanny Cerrito in Jules Perrot's Pas de Quatre in London, but she declined. In the same year, having amassed a fortune, she retired from the stage and settled near Hamburg. A few years later her sister Theresa contracted a morganatic marriage with Prince Adalbert of Prussia, and was ennobled under the title of Baroness von Barnim. Theresa was left a widow in 1873, and died on 19 November 1878. Fanny Elssler died in Vienna on 27 November 1884. She was played by Lilian Harvey in the 1937 German film Fanny Elssler. Lya Mara had previously played her in the 1920 silent film Fanny Elssler.

January 1945) was a Czech pianist, classical music composer, educator and organizer of cultural life at Theresienstadt concentration camp. Life Klein was born into a Moravian Jewish family in P≈ôerov and, showing musical talent early, studied piano with R≈Ø≈æena Kurzov√° and Vil√©m Kurz, and composition with Alois H√°ba (in 1939‚Äì40). He was forced to abort his university studies in 1940 when the Nazis closed all institutions of higher learning following their occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Since compositions and performances by Jewish musicians were banned, his own works could not be performed, though he managed to perform as a concert pianist under several aliases for a time, e.g., under the pseudonym Karel Vranek. Despite those harsh circumstances Klein managed to continue composing. In 1940 he was offered a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London, but by that time anti-Jewish legislation prevented his emigration. In December 1941 he was deported by the Nazis to Terez√≠n concentration camp, where along with Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's pupil Pavel Haas, Hans Kr√°sa, and Schoenberg's pupil Viktor Ullmann he became one of the major composers at that camp. He gave concerts in secret,Rodney Winther, An Annotated Guide to Wind Chamber Music, Alfred Music 2004 p.141 but the camp became one of the few in which artistic activity was eventually permitted by Nazis on any scale, if only to deceive the broader public as to their real intentions.Lucy Miller Murray, Chamber Music:An Extensive Guide for Listeners, Rowman & Littlefield 2015 p.237. His works from these years include music for string quartet (similar in tone to Berg's opus 3 work), a string trio, and a piano sonata, among others. Moreover, Klein performed as solo pianist at approximately 15 recitals,Kuna, p. 117 and also participated in chamber music performances (member of piano trio, piano quartet). Klein was deported to Auschwitz in October 1944 and then to F√ºrstengrube, a coal-mining labour camp, in October 1944, less than two weeks after completing his string trio. He died under unclear circumstances during the liquidation of the F√ºrstengrube camp in January 1945. He had confided his manuscripts to Irma Semtska, his Theresienstadt girlfriend, before leaving, and they were turned over to his sister Eliska at the war's end. His work was influenced by Alois H√°ba, Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and particularly Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. He used melody from Jan√°ƒçek's Z√°pisn√≠k zmizel√©ho as a theme in his Divertimento (1940).

She was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom, after being convicted of the murder of her lover, David Blakely. During her childhood, her family moved from Rhyl, to Basingstoke in Hampshire, and, in 1941, to Hampstead in London. In her teens Ellis entered the world of London nightclub hostessing, which led to a chaotic life that included various relationships with men. One of these was with David Blakely, a racing driver engaged to another woman. On Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis shot Blakely dead outside the Magdala public house in Hampstead and was immediately arrested by an off-duty policeman. At her trial in June 1955, she was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. On 13 July, she was hanged at HM Prison Holloway. Early life Ellis was born in Rhyl in North Wales, the fifth of six children. During her childhood her family moved to Basingstoke in Hampshire. Her mother, Elisaberta (Bertha) Goethals, was a Belgian refugee; her father, Arthur Hornby, was a cellist from Manchester. The Register of Marriages gives Arthur Hornby as marrying Elisa B. Goethals, at Chorlton, in 1920. Arthur changed his surname to Neilson after the birth of Ruth's older sister Muriel in 1925. Ellis attended Fairfields Senior Girls' School in Basingstoke, leaving when she was 14 to work as a waitress. Shortly afterwards, in 1941, the Neilsons moved to London. In 1944, 17-year-old Ruth became pregnant by a married Canadian soldier named Clare and gave birth to a son, whom she named Clare Andria Neilson,Dunn, Jane (2010). \\"Ruth Ellis,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. known as \\"Andy\\".Jakubait, Muriel and Weller, Monica (2005).

The child eventually went to live with her mother.Blackhall, p. 95 Career Ellis became a nightclub hostess through nude modelling work, which paid significantly more than the various factory and clerical jobs she had held since leaving school. Morris Conley, the manager of the Court Club in Duke Street, where she worked, blackmailed his hostess employees into sleeping with him. By early 1950 she was making money as a prostitute and became pregnant by one of her regular clients. She had this pregnancy terminated (illegally) in the third month and returned to work as soon as she could. On 8 November 1950, she married 41-year-old George Johnston Ellis, a divorced dentist with two sons, at the register office in Tonbridge, Kent. He had been a customer at the Court Club. He was a violent alcoholic, jealous and possessive, and the marriage deteriorated rapidly because he was convinced she was having an affair. Ruth left him several times but always returned. In 1951, while four months pregnant, Ruth appeared, uncredited, as a beauty queen in the Rank film Lady Godiva Rides Again. She subsequently gave birth to a daughter Georgina, but George refused to acknowledge paternity and they separated shortly afterwards and were later divorced. Ruth and her son moved in with her parents and she went back to prostitution to make ends meet. Murder In 1953, Ruth Ellis became the manager of the Little Club, a nightclub in Knightsbridge. At this time, she was lavished with expensive gifts by admirers, and had a number of celebrity friends. She met David Blakely, three years her junior, through racing driver Mike Hawthorn. Blakely was a well-mannered former public school boy who was educated at Shrewsbury and Sandhurst, but also a hard-drinking racer. Within weeks he moved into her flat above the club, despite being engaged to another woman, Mary Dawson. Ellis became pregnant for the fourth time but had an abortion, feeling she could not reciprocate the level of commitment shown by Blakely towards their relationship.Blackhall, p. 96 She then began seeing Desmond Cussen. Born in 1922 in Surrey, he had been an RAF pilot, flying Lancaster bombers during the Second World War, leaving the RAF in 1946, when he took up accountancy. He was appointed a director of the family business Cussen & Co., a wholesale and retail tobacconists with outlets in London and South Wales. When Ruth was sacked as manager of the Little Club, she moved in with Cussen at 20 Goodward Court, Devonshire Street, north of Oxford Street. The relationship with Blakely continued, however, and became increasingly violent and bitter as Ellis and Blakely continued to see other people. Blakely offered to marry Ellis, to which she consented, but in January 1955 she had another miscarriage after Blakely punched her in the stomach during an argument. The Magdala pub in 2008.

Retrieved 31 May 2019 On Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis took a taxi from Cussen's home to a second floor flat at 29 Tanza Road, Hampstead, the home of Anthony and Carole Findlater, where she suspected Blakely might be. As she arrived, Blakely's car drove off, so she paid off the taxi and walked the to the Magdala,\\"The Magdala\\". Retrieved 6 June 2016 a relatively large public house in South Hill Park where she found Blakely's car parked outside. At around 9:30 pm David Blakely and his friend Clive Gunnell emerged. Blakely passed Ellis waiting on the pavement when she stepped out of Henshaws Doorway, a newsagent next to the Magdala. He ignored her when she said \\"Hello, David,\\" then shouted \\"David!\\" As Blakely searched for the keys to his car,David Cocksedge, on his website 'The Lady Died for Love' described Blakely's car as a green 'Vauxhall Vanguard', a make/model that does not exist. It is presumed that he could have been referring to either a Standard Vanguard or some other model of Vauxhall Ellis took a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson Victory model revolver from her handbag and fired five shots at Blakely. The first shot missed and he started to run, pursued by Ellis round the car, where she fired a second, which caused him to collapse onto the pavement. She then stood over him and fired three more bullets into him. One bullet was fired less than half an inch from Blakely's back and left powder burns on his skin. Ellis was seen to stand over Blakely as she repeatedly tried to fire the revolver's sixth shot, finally firing it into the ground. This bullet ricocheted off the road and slightly injured a bystander. Trial Ellis, in apparent shock, asked Gunnell, \\"Will you call the police, Clive?\\" She was arrested immediately by an off-duty policeman, who heard her say, \\"I am guilty, I'm a little confused.\\" Blakely's body was taken to hospital with multiple bullet wounds to the intestines, liver, lung, aorta and trachea. At Hampstead police station Ellis appeared to be calm and not obviously under the influence of drink or drugs. She made a detailed confession and was charged with murder. She made her first appearance at the magistrates' court on 11 April 1955 and was ordered to be held on remand. She was twice examined by principal Medical Officer, M. R. Penry Williams, who failed to find evidence of mental illness; an electroencephalograph examination on 3 May found no abnormality. While on remand she was examined by psychiatrist Dr D. Whittaker for the defence, and by Dr A. Dalzell on behalf of the Home Office. Neither found evidence of insanity. On 20 June 1955, Ellis appeared in the Number One Court at the Old Bailey, London, before Mr Justice Havers. She was dressed in a black suit and white silk blouse with freshly bleached and coiffured blonde hair. Her defending counsel, Aubrey Melford Stevenson, supported by Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, expressed concern about her appearance (and dyed blonde hair), but she did not alter it to appear less striking. The only question put to Ellis by prosecutor Christmas Humphreys was, \\"When you fired the revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?\\"; her answer was, \\"It's obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.\\" This reply guaranteed a guilty verdict and the mandatory death sentence. The jury took 20 minutes to convict her.Block, Brian P. and Hostettler, John (1997). Hanging in the Balance. Waterside Press. . p. 164. Reprieve decision Ellis remained at Holloway Prison while awaiting execution. She told her mother that she did not want a petition to reprieve her from the death sentence, and took no part in the campaign. But at her relatives' urging her solicitor, John Bickford, wrote a seven-page letter to the Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, setting out the grounds for reprieve.Bresler, pp. 245‚Äì46. George denied the request. In a 2010 television interview, the grandson of the trial judge Sir Cecil Havers, actor Nigel Havers, said his grandfather had written to the Home Secretary recommending a reprieve as he regarded it as a crime passionnel, but received a curt refusal. Ellis dismissed Bickford (who had been chosen by Desmond Cussen) and asked to see Leon Simmons, the clerk to solicitor Victor Mishcon (whose law firm had previously represented her in her divorce proceedings). Before going to see Ellis, Simmons and Mishcon visited Bickford, who urged them to ask Ellis where she had obtained the gun. On 12 July 1955, the day before her execution, Mishcon and Simmons saw Ellis, who wanted to make her will. When they pressed Ellis for the full story, she asked them to promise not to use what she said to try to secure a reprieve; Mishcon refused.Bresler, p. 247. Ellis then said that she had been drinking with Cussen for most of the weekend and that Cussen had given her the gun and some shooting practice. Cussen had also driven her to the murder scene. Following the two-hour interview, Mishcon and Simmons went to the Home Office; the Permanent Secretary, Sir Frank Newsam, was summoned back to London and ordered the head of CID to check the story.Bresler, pp. 248‚Äì49. Lloyd George later said that the police were able to make considerable enquiries but that it made no difference to his decision, and in fact made Ellis's guilt greater by showing the murder was premeditated.Bresler, p. 250. Lloyd George also said that the injury to the bystander was decisive in his decision: \\"We cannot have people shooting off firearms in the street!\\"Bresler, p. 251. In a final letter to Blakely's parents from her prison cell, Ellis wrote \\"I have always loved your son, and I shall die still loving him.\\"Cocksedge, David. The Lady Died For Love. blakeleyons.org.uk Execution The Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, visited Ellis just before the execution.

In the early 1970s the remains of executed women were exhumed for reburial elsewhere, Ellis's in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Her headstone was inscribed \\"Ruth Hornby 1926‚Äì1955\\". Her son, Andy, destroyed the headstone shortly before he committed suicide in 1982. Public reaction and legacy The case caused widespread controversy at the time, evoking exceptionally intense press and public interest to the point that it was discussed by the Cabinet.James, Robert Rhodes (1987), Anthony Eden, p. 420, Papermac, On the day of her execution, the Daily Mirror columnist Cassandra wrote a column attacking the sentence, writing: \\"The one thing that brings stature and dignity to mankind and raises us above the beasts will have been denied her ‚Äî pity and the hope of ultimate redemption\\".Blackhall, p. 98 A petition to the Home Office asking for clemency was signed by 50,000 people, but the Conservative Home Secretary Major Gwilym Lloyd George rejected it. The British Path√© newsreel reporting Ellis's execution openly questioned whether capital punishment‚Äîof a female or of anyone‚Äîhad a place in the 20th century. The novelist Raymond Chandler, then living in Britain, wrote a scathing letter to the Evening Standard, referring to what he described as \\"the medieval savagery of the law\\".Hiney, Tom (1997) Raymond Chandler, A Biography. Grove Press. . p. 224 Though the execution was on the whole supported by the British public, it helped strengthen support for the abolition of the death penalty, which was halted in practice for murder in Britain ten years later (the last execution in the UK occurred in 1964). Reprieve was by then commonplace; according to one statistical account, between 1926 and 1954, 677 men and 60 women had been sentenced to death in England and Wales, but only 375 men and seven women had been executed.Block, Brian P. and Hostettler, John (1997). Hanging in the Balance. Waterside Press. . p. 165. In the early 1970s, Bickford told Scotland Yard that Cussen had told him, in 1955, that Ellis lied at the trial. A police investigation followed but no further action regarding Cussen was taken. Anthony Eden, the Prime Minister at the time, made no reference to the Ellis case in his memoirs, nor is there anything in his papers. He accepted that the decision was the responsibility of the Home Secretary, but there are indications that he was troubled by it.James, Robert Rhodes (1987) \\"Anthony Eden,\\" p. 420. Papermac, . Foreign newspapers observed that the concept of the crime passionnel seemed alien to the British. =Family aftermath= Ellis's husband, George Ellis, descended into alcoholism and died by suicide, hanging himself at a Jersey hotel on 2 August 1958. In 1969 Ellis's mother, Berta Neilson, was found unconscious in a gas-filled room in her flat in Hemel Hempstead. She never fully recovered and did not speak coherently again. Her son, Andy, who was ten at the time of his mother's hanging, took his own life in a bedsit in 1982, shortly after desecrating his mother's grave. The trial judge, Sir Cecil Havers, had sent money every year for Andy's upkeep, and Christmas Humphreys, the prosecution counsel at Ellis's trial, paid for his funeral. Ellis's daughter, Georgina, who was three when her mother was executed, was fostered when her father killed himself three years later. She died of cancer aged 50. =Pardon campaign= The case continues to have a strong grip on the British imagination and in 2003 was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The Court firmly rejected the appeal, although it made clear that it could rule only on the conviction based on the law as it stood in 1955, and not on whether she should have been executed.Court of Appeal, 2003; section 89 The court was critical of the fact that it had been obliged to consider the appeal: In July 2007 a petition was published on the 10 Downing Street website asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reconsider the Ruth Ellis case and grant her a pardon in the light of new evidence that the Old Bailey jury in 1955 was not asked to consider. It expired on 4 July 2008.Author May Prove Hanged Woman's Innocence (from This Is Local London).

He was regarded as one of the most brilliant conductors of his day. He composed three operas, of which Agnes Bernauer (Weimar, 1880) was the most successful, as well as a string quartet and numerous songs and other music. His orchestration of Richard Wagner's \\"Wesendonck Lieder\\" is still the most commonly performed version. He was also a teacher, and his pupils included Ernest van Dyck and Wilhelm Petersen. Career Mottl was born in Unter Sankt Veit, today Hietzing, Vienna in 1856. His date of birth has been reported variously as 29 July, 24 August, and 29 August. After early voice training at the L√∂wenburg Konvikt, a training school for the Imperial Court Chapel, he had a successful career at the Vienna Conservatory. He was soon recognized as a gifted conductor of Wagner's music, assisted Hans Richter in preparing the first complete Ring Cycle at Bayreuth in 1876, and himself conducted Tristan und Isolde at Bayreuth in 1886. The best-known version of Wagner's \\"Wesendonck Lieder\\" is an orchestration by Mottl. From 1881 to 1903 he was chief conductor at the Karlsruhe Opera and was widely renowned for his work there, particularly in Wagner, Berlioz and Chabrier, whose operas he championed. In 1903 he conducted the premier of Friederich Klose's opera Ilsebill there to great acclaim. He also orchestrated Chabrier's Bourr√©e fantasque and Trois valses romantiques, and arranged a popular suite of orchestral excerpts from Christoph Willibald Gluck's operas. In later years, as a conductor of Wagner especially, he visited Amsterdam, London and New York, guest-conducting the Metropolitan Opera in 1903. He was made a director of the Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1904. Mottl's grave monument In June 1907 he cut some player piano rolls with Welte-Mignon, including his own piano transcription of the Prelude, the Love Duet and Brang√§ne's Warning from Tristan. He suffered a heart attack on 21 June 1911 while conducting his 100th performance of Tristan in Munich. He was taken to a hospital where he died 11 days later on 2 July, aged 54, but not before marrying his longtime mistress, the soprano Zdenka Fa√übender. His grave monument was made by Fritz Behn.

Over the next several seasons he provided solid play at first base, routinely batting between .270 and .291 every season but one through 1943, though he lost significant playing time from 1938 to 1940 due to a hip injury and an ankle broken twice while sliding.

The track conducted Thoroughbred flat racing and Standardbred harness racing between 1997 and 2014, and the racing returned to the track in 2019. It is owned by the Colonial Downs Group. History and information The track opened on September 1, 1997. More than 13,000 attended the track on opening day. The track used several unconventional construction and business approaches. They constructed one of the largest tracks in size in the country but built a relatively small clubhouse. They also built OTBs prior to the opening of the track. The track also struck a deal with Maryland to stop Maryland racing during the Colonial Downs thoroughbred meet, although this later ended. The tract of land on which the track is built was obtained through an eminent domain suit brought by the State of Virginia against an African American/Native American family (Tero Johnson) that had owned the majority of the land since 1863. Until 2005, the track was managed by the Maryland Jockey Club under a complicated agreement with Virginia and Maryland regulators and the Maryland-Virginia Racing Circuit. The track was fairly successful and offered good summertime turf racing in the traditionally poor three-year-old turf division. The track ran two legs of the annual Jacobs Investments Grand Slam of Grass. This event consisted of the Colonial Turf Cup and the Virginia Derby from Colonial Downs, the Secretariat Stakes from Arlington Park and the Breeders' Cup Turf. The track requested 25 thoroughbred dates in 2009, down from 45 in 2008. After negotiations with the track's horsemen and the Commonwealth of Virginia, the track ran 40 thoroughbred dates. The schedule originally ran from June 12 to August 4, 2009, but was later moved up one week. This allowed the track to run live racing on Belmont Stakes day, June 6. The fall harness meet ran 36 dates, from September 8 through November 7. The harness meet was timed to end on Breeders' Cup weekend. Colonial Downs has not offered thoroughbred racing since 2013, due to a dispute between track management and horsemen's groups. Harness racing ended the following year, and all track-affiliated betting sites were closed in April 2015. The track filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking clarity in recently-amended state horse racing laws, but the case was dismissed in the District Court on November 24, 2015. A race on the Secretariat turf course after racing was resumed at Colonial Downs in New Kent County, Virginia. Aug. 10, 2019.In November 2015, Colonial Downs was denied 2016 racing dates by the Virginia Racing Commission. In rendering their decision, commissioners stated that Colonial Downs \\"displayed callous disregard for the industry\\" when it surrendered its unlimited racing license in 2014. A spokesman for Jacobs Entertainment said that all options to keep the track open have been exhausted. In April 2018, Virginia enacted a law to allow historical racing machines (similar to slot machines) at the track and at off-track betting parlors, in an effort to make it economically viable to reopen the track. Weeks later, the track was purchased by Revolutionary Racing, a Chicago-based group of investors and gaming executives, for a price of over $20 million. Revolutionary Racing alongside other investors then formed the Colonial Downs Group, who currently own the track. Colonial Downs held its first race since 2013 on August 8, 2019. Physical attributes The track has a one and one-quarter mile dirt oval, a seven and one half furlong inner turf oval and a one and one-eighth mile outer turf oval. Harness races start from a chute on the back stretch of the dirt oval, making for the only one-turn mile in harness racing. Racing The track featured an autumn harness racing meet. Colonial Downs was the only 1 and 1/4 mile track in North America with harness racing and features a one turn mile. The horses start from a chute on the backstretch. Harness racing times at Colonial Downs were the fastest in racing. On October 11, 2008, the world trotting record was set during the $100,000 Patriot Invitational. It was set by Enough Talk.

Biography La battaglia delle belle donne, published by Laterza, 1938 Il libro delle rime, published by Laterza, 1936 Born in Florence or in RagusaBari≈°a Krekiƒá, Dubrovnik, Italy, and the Balkans in the late Middle Ages (modern Dubrovnik), he was the son of Benci di Uguccione, surnamed \\"Buono\\", a Florentine merchant of the noble and ancient family of the Sacchetti. He was married three times; first to Maria Felice Strozzi with whom he had two sons, Filippo and Niccolo. Franco‚Äôs second wife was Ghita di Piero Gherardini, his third wife was Giovanna di Francesco Bruni. He was the brother of Giannozzo Sacchetti, a follower of Catherine of Siena, who was executed following the Ciompi Revolt. While still a young man he achieved repute as a poet, and he appears to have traveled on affairs of more or less importance as far as to Genoa, Milan and Slavonia. After 1363 he settled in Florence. When a sentence of banishment was passed upon the rest of the house of Sacchetti by the Florentine authorities in 1380 (after the Ciompi revolt) it appears that Sacchetti was expressly exempted, per esser tanto uomo buono (\\"because he is a very good man\\"), and in 1383 he was one of the eight, discharging the office of prior for the months of March and April. In 1386 he was chosen ambassador to Genoa, but preferred to go as podest√† to Bibbiena in Casentino. In 1392 he was podest√† of San Miniato, and in 1396 he held a similar office at Faenza. In 1398 he received from his fellow-citizens the post of captain of their then province of Romagna, having his residence at Portico. The date of his death is unknown; most probably it occurred about 1400, though some writers place it as late as 1410. He wrote sonnets, canzoni, madrigals, and other poems; his best known works are however his Novelle (short stories). They were originally 300 in number, but today only 258 remain, the rest having been lost. They were not fitted into any framework like that of Boccaccio's Decameron. The best of them are of a humorous character; and their style is more simple and colloquial than Boccaccio's. The story given as a specimen probably exists (under one form or another) in the folk tales of every European nation. Sacchetti died at San Miniato around 1400.

It was introduced alongside the Quadra 900 as the first computers in the Quadra series using Motorola 68040 processor. It is also the first computer from Apple to be housed in a mini-tower form factor, which in 1991 was becoming a popular alternative to standard desktop-on-monitor cases that were common through the 1980s. The Quadra 700 originally had a list price of US$5,700, but had dropped to under $4,700 for a base model by the time its replacement, the Macintosh Quadra 800, went on sale in early 1993. The Centris 650, also introduced around the same time, offered incrementally more performance than the Quadra 700 in a desktop-style case at a price point closer to $3,000.  Hardware  Form factor: The Quadra 700 case is largely the same as the popular Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci models; this made it possible for users of those models to upgrade to the more powerful Quadra 700. Users sometimes placed the older case vertically in a mini-tower orientation and the Quadra 700 recognized this by having the Apple logo and model name printed in the vertical orientation. The IIcx and IIci were designed to allow their rubber feet to be moved to the side for vertical orientation as well. CPU: Motorola 68040 @ 25 MHz. The clock oscillator runs at 50 MHz; replacing it with a faster oscillator (up to 74 MHz) results in a performance increase. Memory: The Quadra 700 could be upgraded to 68 megabytes of RAM, which with its 25 MHz processor made it a very useful computer for scientific or design work. Expansion: Two Nubus slots and a PDS slot; processor upgrades from Apple and other manufacturers were sold for the 700 when the PowerPC 601 accelerator cards came along in 1994. Storage: 80 and 160 MB hard disks were available at launch. A faster 230 MB unit became available in mid-1993 when the Quadra 950 was introduced. Video: Like the IIci, the 700 has integrated graphics built into the system board but, unlike the earlier model, it uses dedicated VRAM for its video memory. The onboard video came with 512 kilobytes VRAM soldered to the motherboard, and supported resolutions up to 1152x870. The video memory was expandable to 2 megabytes via 6 256-kilobyte 100 nS VRAM SIMMs in each of VRAM SIMM expansion slots on the motherboard. Expanding the video memory to 2 megabytes allowed for 24-bit (Millions) color at resolutions up to 832x624. Sound: The sound was 8-bit stereo. Ports: I/O was available with dual serial ports, an AAUI ethernet port, mic in, and a DB-25 SCSI connector. The Quadra 700, along with the 900, are the first Macintosh models with built-in support for Ethernet networking. Operating system: System 7.0.1 was included as standard. This is the earliest Macintosh model to support Mac OS 8. In popular culture This Macintosh, along with some other models, was one of the computers featured in the film Jurassic Park (1993).

Early years  Dingeman Adriaan Henry van der Sluijs was born in 1947 in Hilversum, Netherlands. His father is Harry van der Sluijs (also seen as Vandersluys) and he has a younger sister. Diamonde emigrated with his family from the Netherlands to Australia when he was four years old. Diamonde was raised in a Jehovah's Witness family, living in the suburb of Villawood near the migrant hostel of that name.  The Easybeats  Widely regarded as Australia's greatest pop group of the mid-1960s, The Easybeats had their beginnings in Sydney's Villawood Migrant Hostel. All of the five founding members were migrants to Australia from Europe. In mid-1964 the group were formed by van der Sluys (renamed as Dick Diamonde) on bass guitar, he was joined by fellow Dutchman, Johannes van den Berg (known as Harry Vanda) on lead guitar and vocals, George Young from Scotland on guitar and vocals, and two Englishmen: lead singer Stevie Wright (Yorkshire) and drummer, Snowy Fleet (Liverpool). By October 1969 the Easybeats had disbanded and according to Young, Diamonde was \\"having a ball just being Dick.\\" In that same month his mother reflected, \\"He has given up the faith... We never encouraged him to follow this life. As Jehovah's Witnesses we do not believe in creature worship... It is not right the children idolise him.\\" In September 1986 Diamonde participated in a reunion of the Easybeats for a series of concerts touring Australian capitals in the following two months.

Background Hertford was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway, and Charlotte Shorter, daughter of John Shorter of Bybrook. He was a descendant of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. He succeeded to the barony on the death of his father in 1732. The first few years after his father's death were spent in Italy and Paris. On his return to England he took his seat, as 2nd Baron Conway, among the Peers in November 1739. Henry Seymour Conway, politician and soldier, was his younger brother. Political career In August 1750 he was created Viscount Beauchamp and Earl of Hertford, both of which titles had earlier been created for and forfeited by his ancestor Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of England, following his attainder and execution in 1552. The Seymour family had inherited a moiety of the feudal barony of Hatch Beauchamp, in Somerset, by marriage to the heiress Cicely Beauchamp (d.1393). In 1755, according to Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, \\"The Earl of Hertford, a man of unblemished morals, but rather too gentle and cautious to combat so presumptuous a court, was named Ambassador to Paris.\\" He appointed David Hume as his Secretary, who wrote of him, \\"I do not believe there is in the World a man of more probity & Humanity, endowd with a very good Understanding, and adornd with very elegant Manners & Behaviour\\".Klibansky, Raymond and Mossner, Ernest C. (eds.) (1954). New Letters of David Hume. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.78. However, due to the demands of the French, the journey to Paris was suspended. From 1751 to 1766 he was Lord of the Bedchamber to George II and George III. In 1756 he was made a Knight of the Garter and, in 1757, Lord-Lieutenant and Guardian of the Rolls of the County of Warwick and City of Coventry. In 1763 he became Privy Councillor and, from October 1763 to June 1765, was a successful ambassador in Paris. He witnessed the sad last months of Madame de Pompadour, whom he admired, and wrote a kindly epitaph for her.Mitford, Nancy Madame de Pompadour Hamish Hamilton 1954 In the autumn of 1765 he became Viceroy of Ireland where, as an honest and religious man, he was well liked. An anonymous satirist in 1777 described him as \\"the worst man in His Majesty's dominions\\", and also emphasised Hertford's greed and selfishness, adding \\"I cannot find any term for him but avaricious.\\" However, this anonymous attack does not seem to be justified. In 1782, when she was only fifty-six, his wife died after having nursed their grandson at Forde's Farm, Thames Ditton, where she caught a violent cold. According to Walpole, \\"Lord Hertford's loss is beyond measure. She was not only the most affectionate wife, but the most useful one, and almost the only person I ever saw that never neglected or put off or forgot anything that was to be done. She was always proper, either in the highest life or in the most domestic.\\" (Walpole visited Forde's Farm on several occasions from his residence at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham.) Within two years of the tragedy, Lord Hertford had sold Forde's Farm to Mrs Charlotte Boyle Walsingham, and a further two years later, she had re-developed the estate, building a new mansion which she called Boyle Farm, a name still in use today. In July 1793 he was created Marquess of Hertford, with the subsidiary title of Earl of Yarmouth. He enjoyed this elevation for almost a year until his death at the age of seventy-six, on 14 June 1794, at the house of his daughter, the Countess of Lincoln. He died as the result of an infection following a minor injury he received while riding. He was buried at Arrow, in Warwickshire. Marriage Isabella, Countess of Hertford by Alexander Roslin (1765) Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow Lord Hertford married Lady Isabella Fitzroy, daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, on 29 May 1741. Her grandfather was Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton (1663-1690), an illegitimate son of King Charles II. By his wife he had thirteen children: *Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford (12 February 1743 ‚Äì 28 June 1822) *Lady Anne Seymour-Conway (1 August 1744 ‚Äì 4 November 1784), married Charles Moore, 1st Marquess of Drogheda. *Lord Henry Seymour-Conway (15 December 1746 ‚Äì 5 February 1830) *Lady Sarah Frances Seymour-Conway (27 September 1747 ‚Äì 20 July 1770), married Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry. *Lord Robert Seymour-Conway (20 January 1748 ‚Äì 23 November 1831) *Lady Gertrude Seymour-Conway (9 October 1750 ‚Äì September 1793), married George Mason-Villiers, 2nd Earl Grandison. *Lady Frances Seymour-Conway (4 December 1751 ‚Äì 11 November 1820), married Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, a son of Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. *Rev.

He married Isabella Hamilton, granddaughter of James Hamilton, 7th Earl of Abercorn, and was the father of Sir George Hamilton Seymour, a British diplomatist. He is not known to have suffered himself from any mental abnormality, but a noted strain of eccentricity, even madness, appeared among his descendants: the debauched behaviour of his grandson, the 3rd Marquess, and the suicide of another grandson, Viscount Castlereagh, were both attributed to a strain of madness supposed to be hereditary in the Seymour Conway family.Hyde, Montgomery The Strange Death of Lord Castlereagh William Heinemann 1959 p.157 Lord Hertford died in Surrey, England.

Top row is the view into the cavity and the bottom is the side view Cucurbiturils are macrocyclic molecules made of glycoluril (=C4H2N4O2=) monomers linked by methylene bridges (-CH2-). The oxygen atoms are located along the edges of the band and are tilted inwards, forming a partly enclosed cavity. The name is derived from the resemblance of this molecule with a pumpkin of the family of Cucurbitaceae. Cucurbiturils are commonly written as cucurbit[n]uril, where n is the number of glycoluril units. Two common abbreviations are CB[n], or simply CBn. These compounds are particularly interesting to chemists because they are suitable hosts for an array of neutral and cationic species. The binding mode is thought to occur through hydrophobic interactions, and, in the case of cationic guests, through cation-dipole interactions as well. The dimensions of cucurbiturils are generally on the ~ 10 √Ö size scale. For instance, the cavity of cucurbit[6]uril has a height ~ 9.1 √Ö, an outer diameter ~ 5.8 √Ö, and an inner diameter ~ 3.9 √Ö.

Other common molecular capsules that share a similar molecular shape with cucurbiturils include cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and pillararenes.  Synthesis Cucurbituril Synthesis Cucurbiturils are amidals (less precisely aminals) and synthesized from urea 1 and a dialdehyde (e.g., glyoxal 2) via a nucleophilic addition to give the intermediate glycoluril 3. This intermediate is condensed with formaldehyde to give hexamer cucurbit[6]uril above 110 ¬∞C. Ordinarily, multifunctional monomers such as 3 would undergo a step-growth polymerization that would give a distribution of products, but due to favorable strain and an abundance of hydrogen bonding, the hexamer is the only reaction product isolated after precipitation. Decreasing the temperature of the reaction to between 75 and 90 ¬∞C can be used to access other sizes of cucurbiturils including CB[5], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10]. CB[6] is still the major product; the other ring sizes are formed in smaller yields. The isolation of sizes other than CB[6] requires fractional crystallization and dissolution. CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8] are all currently commercially available. The larger sizes are a particularly active area of research since they can bind larger and more interesting guest molecules, thus expanding their potential applications. Crystal structure of the CB[10]‚Ä¢CB[5]complex including a chlorine anion. Cucurbit[10]uril is particularly difficult to isolate. It was first discovered by Day and coworkers in 2002 as an inclusion complex containing CB[5] by fractional crystallization of the cucurbituril reaction mixture. A Cucurbituril-Based Gyroscane: A New Supramolecular Form AnthonyI. Day, Rodney J. Blanch, Alan P. Arnold, Susan Lorenzo, Gareth R. Lewis, and Ian Dance Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.; 2002; 41(2) pp 275-277. The CB[10]‚Ä¢CB[5] was unambiguously identified by single crystal X-ray structural analysis that revealed the complex resembled a molecular gyroscope. In this case, the free rotation of the CB[5] within the CB[10] cavity mimics the independent rotation of a flywheel within the frame of a gyroscope. Isolation of pure CB[10] could not be accomplished by direct separation methods since the compound has such a high affinity for CB[5]. The strong binding affinity for the CB[5] can be understood since it has a complementary size and shape to the cavity of the CB[10]. Pure CB[10] was isolated by Isaacs and coworkers in 2005 by introducing a more strongly binding melamine diamine guest that is capable of displacing the CB[5].Cucurbit[10]uril Simin Liu, Peter Y. Zavalij, and Lyle Isaacs J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 2005; 127(48) pp 16798 - 16799; (Communication) Abstract The melamine diamine guest was then separated from the CB[10] by reaction with acetic anhydride that converted the positively charged amine groups to neutrally charged amides. Cucurbiturils strongly bind cationic guests, but by removing the positive charge from the melamine diamine guest reduces the association constant to the point it can be removed by washing with methanol, DMSO, and water. The CB[10] has an unusually large cavity (870 √Ö3) that's free and capable of binding extraordinarily large guests including a cationic calix[4]arene.  Applications Cucurbiturils have been used by chemists for various applications, including drug delivery, asymmetric synthesis, molecular switching, and dye tuning. = Supramolecular host molecules = host‚Äìguest complex with a p-xylylenediammonium bound within a cucurbit[6]uril Cucurbiturils are efficient host molecules in molecular recognition and have a particularly high affinity for positively charged or cationic compounds. High association constants with positively charged molecules are attributed to the carbonyl groups that line each end of the cavity and can interact with cations in a similar fashion to crown ethers. The affinity of cucurbiturils can be very high. For example, the affinity equilibrium constant of cururbit[7]uril with the positively charged 1-aminoadamantane hydrochloride is experimentally determined at 4.23*1012. Host guest interactions also significantly influence solubility behavior of cucurbiturils. Cucurbit[6]uril dissolves poorly in just about any solvent but solubility is greatly improved in a solution of potassium hydroxide or in an acidic solution. The cavitand forms a positively charged inclusion compound with a potassium ion or a hydronium ion respectively which have much greater solubility than the uncomplexed neutral molecule. CB[10] is large enough to hold other molecular hosts such as a calixarene molecule. With a calixarene guest different chemical conformations (cone, 1,2-alternate, 1,3-alternate) are in rapid equilibrium. Allosteric control is provided when an adamantane molecule forces a cone conformation with a calixarene - adamantane inclusion complex within a CB[10] molecule. =Rotaxane macrocycles= Given their high affinities to form inclusion complexes cucurbiturils have been employed as the macrocycles component of a rotaxane. After formation of the supramolecular assembly or threaded complex with a guest molecule such as hexamethylene diamine the two ends of the guest can be reacted with bulky groups that will then act as a stoppers preventing the two separate molecules from dissociating.The complex formation of a, w-dicarboxylic acids and a, w-diols with cucurbituril and a-cyclodextrin. the first step to the formation of rotaxanes and polyrotaxenes of thepolyester type Hans-J√ºrgen Buschmann, Klaus Jansen, Eckhard Schollmeyer Acta Chim. Slov. 1999, 46(3), pp. 405-411 Article In another rotaxane system with a CB[7] wheel, the axle is a 4,4'-bipyridinium or viologen subunit with two carboxylic acid terminated aliphatic N-substituents at both ends. In water at concentration higher than 0.5 mM complexation is quantitative without need of stoppers. At pH = 2 the carboxylic end-groups are protonated and the wheel shuttles back and forth between them as evidenced by the presence of just two aromatic viologen protons in the proton NMR spectrum. At pH = 9 the wheel is locked around the viologen center. More recently, rotaxaneV. Ramalingam and A. R. Urbach, Org. Lett., 2011, 13, 4898 with a CB[8] wheel was synthesized. This rotaxane can bind neutral guest molecules. =Drug delivery vehicles= Cucurbituril's host‚Äìguest properties have been explored for drug delivery vehicles. The potential of this application has been explored with cucurbit[7]uril that forms an inclusion compound with the important cancer fighting drug oxaliplatin. CB[7] was employed despite the fact that it is more difficult to isolate since it has much greater solubility in water and its larger cavity size can accommodate the drug molecule. The resulting complex was found to have increased stability and greater selectivity that may lead to fewer side effects. =Supramolecular catalysts= Cucurbiturils have also been explored as supramolecular catalysts. Larger cucurbiturils, such as cucurbit[8]uril can bind multiple guest molecules. CB[8] forms a complex 2:1 (guest:host) with (E)-diaminostilbene dihydrochloride which is accommodated by CB[8]'s larger internal diameter of 8.8 angstrom and height 9.1 angstrom.A facile, stereoselective [2 + 2] photoreaction mediated by cucurbit[8]uril Sang Yong Jon, Young Ho Ko, Sang Hyun Park, Hee-Joon Kim and Kimoon Kim Chemical Communications, 2001, (19), 1938 - 1939 DOI Abstract The close proximity and optimal orientation of the guest molecules within the cavity enhances the rate of the photochemical cyclization to give cyclobutane dimer with a 19:1 stereoselectivity for the syn configuration when bound to CB[8].

Sci. 2008, 7, 408-414. In general, it has been found that the confined, low-polarity environment provided by the cucurbiturils leads to enhanced brightness, increased photostability, increased fluorescence lifetimes, and solvatochromism consistent with moving to an environment of lower polarity.  Related compounds  Inverted cucurbiturils or iCB[x] are CB analogues with one glycoluril repeating unit inverted. In this unit the methine protons actually point into the cavity and this makes the cavity less spacious. Inverted cucurbiturils form as a side-product in CB-forming reactions, with yields between 2 and 0.4%. Isolation of this type of CB compound is possible because it is more difficult to form inclusion compounds that ordinarily form with regular CB's. Inverted cucurbiturils are believed to be the kinetically controlled reaction products because the heating of iCB[6] in acidic medium results in a mixture of CB[5], CB[6] and CB[7] in a 24:13:1 ratio.

Y√©-y√© was a particular form of counterculture that derived most of its inspiration from British and American rock and roll. Additional stylistic elements of y√©-y√© song composition include baroque, exotica, pop, jazz and the French chanson. History The y√©-y√© movement had its origins in the radio program Salut les copains (loosely translated as \\"hello mates\\" or \\"hello pals\\"), created by Jean Frydman and hosted by Daniel Filipacchi and Frank T√©not,Tinker, Chris. ‚ÄúShaping 1960s youth in Britain and France: Fabulous and Salut lescopains.‚Äù International Journal of Cultural Studies. 14 (6) (November 2011): pg. 641-657. which was first aired in December 1959. The phrase \\"Salut les copains\\" itself dates back to the title of a 1957 song by Gilbert B√©caud and Pierre Delano√´, who had little regard for the y√©-y√© music that the radio show typically featured. The program became an immediate success, and one of its sections, \\"Le chouchou de la semaine\\" (\\"This Week's Sweetheart\\"), became the starting point for most y√©- y√© singers. Any song that was presented as a chouchou went straight to the top places in the charts. The Salut les copains phenomenon continued with the magazine of the same name, which was first published in 1962 in France, with German, Spanish and Italian (\\"Ciao Amici\\") editions following shortly afterward.Tinker, Chris. ‚ÄúShaping 1960s youth in Britain and France: Fabulous and Salut les copains.‚Äù International Journal of Cultural Studies. 14 (6) (November 2011): pg. 641‚Äì657.

Serge Gainsbourg, France Gall and Mario del Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest 1965, where \\"Poup√©e de cire, poup√©e de son\\" took the award. Y√©-y√© music was a mostly European phenomenon and usually featured young female singers. France Gall, for example, was only sixteen years of age when she released her first album and seventeen when she won the Eurovision Song Contest (for Luxembourg) singing the prototype bubblegum song \\"Poup√©e de cire, poup√©e de son\\". Another later hit by Gall included \\"Laisse tomber les filles\\", a cover version of which by April March called \\"Chick Habit\\" appeared in Quentin Tarantino's 2007 film Death Proof. Y√©-y√© songs had innocent themes such as that of Fran√ßoise Hardy's \\"Tous les gar√ßons et les filles\\" (\\"All the guys and girls my age know how it feels to be happy, but I am lonely. When will I know how it feels to have someone?\\"). France had a large market for the consumption of French-language songs at the time. Unlike other European nations such as West Germany, the French were more willing to support artists from their own country, singing in their native tongue.Achterberg, P., Heilbron, J., Houtman, D., and Aupers, S. ‚ÄúA Cultural Globalization of Popular Music?

Y√©-y√© helped assimilate that music in a unique, French way, and with the popularity of Salut les copains, the public began to see stars such as France Gall emerge. The singers were sexy in a deliberately contrived na√Øve manner. Composer and singer/songwriter Serge Gainsbourg once called Gall the French Lolita and, wanting to exploit her innocence,Briggs, Jonathyne. \\"Sex and the Girl‚Äôs Single: French Popular Music and the Long Sexual Revolution of the 1960s.\\" Journal of the History of Sexuality 21.3 (2012): 523-547.

Sylvie Vartan married rock star Johnny Hallyday in 1965 and toured in America and Asia, but she remained a y√©-y√© at heart, and as late as 1968 she recorded the song \\"Jolie poup√©e\\" (\\"Pretty Doll\\"), about a girl who regrets having abandoned her doll after growing up. Sheila portrayed the image of a well-behaved young girl. Her first hit was \\"L'√©cole est finie\\" (\\"School is over\\") in 1962. In 1967, teen y√©-y√© singer Jacqueline Ta√Øeb won the Best Newcomer award in Cannes at the Midem awards for her hit single \\"7 heures du matin\\". Other significant girl singers of the era include teen TV star Christine Delaroche, Jocelyne, Zouzou, Evy, Cosette and Annie Philippe. Some girl groups emerged, such as Les Parisiennes, influenced by acts like the Shangri-Las. Although originating in France, the y√©-y√© movement extended over Western Europe. Italian singer Mina became her country's first female rock-and-roll singer in 1959.Nessuno. In TV esplode Mina. Galleria della canzone site. Retrieved 27 June 2007 In the following few years, she move to middle-of-the-road girl pop. After her scandalous relationship and pregnancy with a married actor in 1963, Mina developed her image into that of a grown-up \\"bad girl\\". An example of her style may be found in the lyrics of the song \\"Ta-ra-ta-ta\\": \\"The way you smoke, you are irresistible to me, you look like a real man.\\"Mina ‚Äì Fumo blu (Ta ra ta ta ta ta) Musica e memoria site. Retrieved 21 January 2008 By contrast, her compatriot Rita Pavone cast the image of a typical teenage y√©-y√© girl; for example, the lyrics of her 1964 hit \\"Cuore\\" complained how love made the protagonist suffer. In Italy, the y√©-y√© wave ended around 1967, vanishing under the emergence of British blues rock, pop and psychedelia. Parisian-born singer Catherine Spaak had a massive success in Italy with a style very close to that of Fran√ßoise Hardy. Other significant Italian y√©-y√© girls include Mari Marabini, Carmen Villani, Anna Identici and the girl groups Le Amiche, Le Snobs and Sonia e le Sorelle. In Spain, y√©-y√© music was at first considered to be incompatible with Catholicism. However, this did not stop the y√©-y√© culture from spreading, although a bit later than in the rest of Europe; in 1968 Spanish y√©-y√© girl Massiel won the Eurovision song contest with \\"La, la, la\\", while the sweet, na√Øve-looking singer Karina enjoyed success as the Spanish y√©-y√© queen with her hits \\"En un mundo nuevo\\" and \\"El ba√∫l de los recuerdos\\". In the 1965 film Historias de la televisi√≥n, Concha Velasco's character, who competes against a y√©-y√© girl, sings La chica ye-ye (\\"The Y√©-y√© Girl\\"). The song became a hit, and Velasco is often remembered as, of course, la chica yey√©. Y√©-y√© grew very popular in Japan and formed the origins of Shibuya-kei and Japanese idol music. Gall recorded a Japanese version of \\"Poup√©e de cire, poup√©e de son\\". The film Cherchez l'idole, featuring Johnny Hallyday, has seen a Japanese DVD release. The y√©-y√© vocal group Les Surfs appear in the film performing their hit song \\"Ca n'a pas d'importance\\". At the end of the 1970s, there was a brief but successful y√©-y√© recurrence in France, spreading across the charts of Western Europe with electro-pop-influenced acts such as Plastic Bertrand, Lio and Elli et Jacno and, in a harder rock vein, Ici Paris and Les Calamit√©s (a subgenre dubbed \\"Y√©-y√© punk\\" by Les Wampas leader Didier Wampas). Lio had a string of hits during 1980, the most famous of which was \\"Amoureux Solitaires\\". This new brand of y√©-y√©, although short-lived, echoed the synthesizer-driven sound that had surfaced recently with new wave music. Because female singers dominated the y√©-y√© scene, the movement is often seen as a feminist statement. Music had long been controlled by men, yet in the midst of the male-centric world of jazz in the 1950s, the number of female singers increased. The y√©-y√© movement contributed to a significant and more feminist portrayal of women within music. In lieu of a desperate and codependent voice, the fun and almost flirtatious point of view depicted in these songs entered the music scene and brought about a small surge of liberation for the leading women of the y√©-y√© genre. Gall's 1966 song \\"Baby Pop,\\" for example, adopts a playful attitude toward the traditional institution of marriage, singing \\"On your wedding night, it'll be too late to regret it.\\"  Y√©-y√© boys  While the y√©-y√© movement was led by female singers, it was not an exclusively female movement. The y√©-y√© masterminds (such as Serge Gainsbourg, who wrote several hits for France Gall, Petula Clark and Brigitte Bardot, but was considerably older and came from a jazz background) were distinct from the actual y√©-y√© singers. Michel Polnareff, for example, played the tormented, hopeless lover in songs such as \\"Love Me Please Love Me\\", while Jacques Dutronc claimed to have seduced Santa Claus's daughter in \\"La Fille du P√®re No√´l\\". Among the more popular male y√©-y√© singers was Claude Fran√ßois, notable for songs such as \\"Belles, Belles, Belles\\", a French- language adaptation of the Everly Brothers' and Eddie Hodges' \\"(Girls, Girls, Girls) Made to Love\\". In Portugal, the first y√©-y√© bands appeared in Coimbra in 1956, most notably Os Babies, led by Jos√© Cid. Other Portuguese bands followed afterward, including Os Conchas, Os Ekos, Os Sheiks, Os Celtas, Conjunto Acad√©mico Jo√£o Paulo, Os Dem√≥nios Negros and singers such as Daniel Bacelar.  Impact of y√©-y√©  The y√©-y√© movement maintains a particular prevalence in the music world because of its swinging, catchy rhythms and carefree lyrics. Unlike the confining strictures of society, y√©-y√© promoted a refreshing and invigorating newness and inevitably promoted a sort of sexual rebellion that greatly characterized the 1960s. Dalida's 1960 song \\"Itsi bitsi, petit bikini\\", previously recorded as \\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\\" by Brian Hyland, perfectly illustrated y√©-y√©'s newfound nonchalance and release from prudish subject matter. The song, \\"...which denotes a nonchalant and undisciplined listening,\\" is about a girl afraid to reveal her bikini to fellow beachgoers, and it represents the shocking aspect of the lax attitude toward an increased sexuality, especially for women, as bikinis were previously considered scandalous. Similarly, y√©-y√© contributed to the creation a youth culture within a postwar France that expressed a certain playfulness and carefree perspective on life. Sociologist and philosopher Edgar Morin commented on the rise and popularity of y√©-y√© music and culture, \\"...seeing in y√©-y√©'s frantic, syncopated rhythms simultaneously a commodified music...of adult consumption, and a festive, playful hedonism...\\" As it was for any postwar youth culture, y√©-y√© acted as a creative outlet that aided in defining an era as well as an identity for Europe, specifically France. The archetype of la parisienne, exuding an exotic charm and magnetic appeal, was greatly defined by the influence of the numerous y√©-y√© girls within the scene and created an indelible mark in the worlds of both fashion and style. The \\"...escapist, ironic...\\" facets of y√©-y√© enticed thousands of listeners, promoting a gaiety and glamour that intertwined with the sexual freedom and modernity of the Swinging Sixties. In popular cultureA 1964 Life article titled \\"Hooray for the Y√©-Y√© Girls\\" attempted to introduce three popular female y√©-y√© singers, Sylvie Vartan, Sheila and Fran√ßoise Hardy, to American readers. It erroneously implies that the term \\"y√©-y√©\\" is derived from the shouts of the crowds watching the performers.Y√©-Y√© Land *In her 1964 essay \\"Notes on \\"Camp\\"\\", Susan Sontag cited y√©-y√© as an example of an entire genre being annexed by the camp sensibility. * The Italian title of the 1966 film Out of Sight was 007 1/2 agente per forza contro gli assassini dello y√© y√©. * American singer April March brought back the y√©-y√© sound when she released the EP Chick Habit, a rewrite of the famous Serge Gainsbourg song \\"Laisse tomber les filles,\\" and also recorded many other y√©-y√©-inspired songs both in the US and France. * French-american singer C√©line Dijon (an obviously parodic pseudonym) with the groups Les Sans-Culottes and Nous non plus (2002-2010). * In 2012, French-Canadian actress Jessica Par√© performed a version of \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\" in the fifth-season premiere of the American television series Mad Men.

After his sports career, he served three terms as a Republican U.S. congressman from North Carolina from 1969 to 1975. He represented North Carolina's 5th congressional district, including Winston- Salem. Prior to that, he had performed as a left-handed pitcher in major league baseball. Early life Mizell was born near Vinegar Bend, Alabama, and was later nicknamed for his birthplace. He was reared in nearby Leakesville, Mississippi, where he graduated from high school in 1949. Career = Baseball = Mizell was a professional pitcher between 1949 and 1963. He took two years out to serve in the United States Army during 1953 and 1954. \\"Vinegar Bend\\" began his Major League Baseball career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952, continuing through 1953, and then again (following military service) from 1956-60. Mizell was twice named an All-Star as a Cardinal, as he was named to both National League teams in 1959 (in those days, two All-Star games were played in a season). Mizell did not appear in either game. In 1960 Mizell joined the Pittsburgh Pirates, playing with them through 1962. He won one championship with them. He also played with the expansion New York Mets in 1962 before retiring. His trade to the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 28, 1960 is considered one of the catalysts towards the Pirates championship run that season. Mizell went 13-5 for the Pirates that season, and finished sixth in the National League in winning percentage. Julian Javier, one of the players traded for Mizell, became a mainstay of the St. Louis Cardinals championship teams of the 1960s. In a nine-season career, Mizell was 90-88 with a 3.85 ERA in 268 games, 230 of which were starts. He pitched 61 complete games, including 15 shutouts. He allowed 654 earned runs and struck out 918 in 1528 and 2/3 innings pitched. Mizell appeared in two World Series games in 1960 (Game 3 as a starter, Game 6 in relief), going 0-1 with a 15.43 ERA, with 2.1 innings pitched. After leaving baseball, Mizell worked in sales and public relations for the Pepsi-Cola company in Winston-Salem until 1967. =Politics= Mizell entered North Carolina politics in the 1960s. He was elected to the Davidson County board of commissioners in 1966. He was the chairman of the board for the two years when he was a member. In 1968, Mizell, a Republican, was elected to represent the 5th District in the 91st United States Congress. A previous Republican candidate, G. Fred Steele, Jr., had polled 46.9 percent of the vote in District 5 in 1966; Steele's showing helped prepare the district for a party transformation in 1968. Mizell defeated Democratic nominee Smith Bagley, an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company official, 84,905 (52.4 percent) to 77,112 (47.6 percent). The previous 5th District representative, Democrat Nick Galifianakis, was moved to the 4th District for the 1968 elections. Mizell was the first Republican to be elected in decades from the 5th District, which was based in Winston-Salem and included much of the northwestern part of the state. He was one of the most popular congressmen in Washington and one of the most conservative. Mizell's 1972 Member of Congress license plate In 1970, Mizell defeated Democrat James G. White, 68,937 (58.1 percent) to 49,663 (41.9 percent). In 1972, he trounced former liberal Arkansas Congressman Brooks Hays, who had moved to North Carolina, 101,375 (64.8 percent) to 54,986 (35.2 percent). Mizell may have thought that his 1972 margin would insulate him from further Democratic challenges in 1974. The Watergate scandal affected Republican House members. Mizell was unseated by Democrat Stephen L. Neal, 64,634 (52 percent) to 59,182 (47.6 percent). In his 1974 defeat, Mizell polled less than three fifths of the total votes that he had received in 1972. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., a former House colleague, appointed Mizell as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for the Economic Development Administration, a post he held from March 1975 to May 1976. In 1976, Mizell challenged Neal again and lost, 83,129 (45.6 percent) to 98,789 (54.2 percent). Neal, a strong supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter, polled almost the same raw vote as Mizell had four years earlier, when he was running on the Nixon-Agnew slate. In 1981, Mizell was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Governmental and Public Affairs in the Reagan administration. Later he was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs, Department of Veterans Affairs, in the George H. W. Bush administration. Mizell also worked as executive director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. =Retirement= Birthplace marker and memorial to Mizell After leaving government life, Mizell resided in Midway, North Carolina. He considered running for his old seat again in the 1990s, but decided against it. In the fall of 1998, Mizell had a heart attack while watching his son Dave coach High Point Andrews High School in a football game against North Davidson High School in Welcome. Just before kickoff, rescue crews were called, and the game was postponed for about a half hour. Mizell was taken to the cardiac care unit of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. He recovered for a few months. Mizell died at the age of 68 in Kerrville, Texas, where he was visiting his wife's family. Mizell was survived by his two sons, Danny and Dave, who both live in North Carolina, and by four grandchildren.

Starting from barren land, the growing town absorbed surrounding villages, such as Yelnikovo, Urakovo, Yandashevo, Anatkasy, and Tsygankasy. November 18, 1960 is customarily considered to be the city's birthday. City status was granted in 1971. The city grew at a rapid rate; in 1978 it covered , and on October 29, 1983 it passed 100,000 inhabitants. Construction began on vacant land. Expanding, it incorporated the neighboring villages of Yelnikovo, Yandashevo, Anatkasy, Tsygankasy, etc. On December 27, 1971 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR issued the Decree \\"On Granting the City of Novocheboksarsk of the Chuvash ASSR the Status of a City Under Republic Jurisdiction\\". It was designed by architects from Leningrad. One of its first streets was Vinokurova, site of a 1985 monument to I. S. Semenovu. Another monument commemorates victims of the Great Patriotic War. Another honors Vladimir I of Kiev. The city consists of three residential areas comprising eighteen microdistricts. The available housing as of August 1, 1999 was 458 apartment houses: 39,452 apartments plus 4,033 rooms.

After being enlarged by publisher Daniel O'Neill it was reportedly one of the largest and most prosperous newspapers in the United States. From 1880 to 1887 native of nearby Cochran's Mills, Nellie Bly worked for the Dispatch writing investigative articles on female factory workers, and later reported from Mexico as a foreign correspondent. The paper was politically independent and was particularly known for its in-depth court reporting. History =The Foster years= J. Heron Foster, founder Established by Col. J. Heron Foster, the Dispatch made its first appearance on 9 February 1846. It was the first penny paper published in western Pennsylvania, initially comprising only four pages. The paper was almost unique in the industry for being profitable almost from the very beginning despite being started during an economic recession. Foster was a strong opponent to slavery in the United States and, having determined that the local market thought similarly lent an abolitionist tone to the paper. He was also a strong supporter of woman suffrage. His daughter Rachel Foster Avery became a prominent worker in the National American Woman Suffrage Association. He hired a woman to work in the newsroom and invited the protesting men to leave if they did not wish to work alongside her. Initially Foster acted not only as business manager and financier of the paper, but wrote extensively in it as well, even producing the copy on a hand press. =Foster & Fleeson= In 1849 Foster brought in a partner, RC Fleeson and the firm changed names to Foster & Fleeson. At the outbreak of the American Civil War Foster joined the Army, but production of the paper continued. The paper had become successful due to its independent approach to the news and in-depth court reporting: :\\"A leading feature of the Dispatch was its elaborate, accurate and interesting reports of the various courts of the county. In regard to the latter, judges and lawyers were profuse in their praise of the legal intelligence in the paper daily, and on more than one occasion lawyers, addressing juries in important cases, analyzed the testimony as it appeared in the Dispatch, and that, too, from longhand reports ‚Äî there were no stenographers in those days.\\" In 1857 the Dispatch was Pittsburgh's leading newspaper with a combined daily and weekly circulation of 14,000, compared with the number two Chronicle's 5,584. Fleeson remained with the paper until his death in 1863. Although ostensibly independent with regard to party politics, the pre-Civil War Dispatch tended in editorial sentiment toward the anti-slavery Free Soil Party and later the Know Nothings, and eventually the Republicans. The paper's warmth toward Know-Nothingism in the mid-1850s reflected Foster's belief that the movement was a better reform vehicle than the competing parties, which he saw as corrupt and beholden to the rising foreign-born vote. Foster rationalized the movement's nativism and anti- Catholicism, arguing that \\"the foreign Catholic vote is almost unanimously cast for slavery\\" and that immigrants made up much of the \\"rum party\\" opposed to temperance reforms. =O'Neill & Rook= Alexander W. Rook, publisher Following the war, in 1865 two employees of the paper, Daniel O'Neill and Alexander W. Rook bought a half interest in the paper, eventually taking full control when Foster died in 1868. O'Neill had been city editor for several years and had his finger on the pulse of the city. Additionally, O'Neill forged an independent path on state and national issues, lending weight to the paper's editorial page. At this point the paper was still four sheets, but management bought new rotary presses and they significantly enlarged its coverage - eventually doubling its size making it one of the largest and most prosperous newspapers in the United States. While a risky move because of the expense, the cover price was increased from 6 to 15 cents per week and the public liked the results and circulation grew making the Dispatch the greatest circulation paper in Pittsburgh with a circulation of 14,000. =Technology upgrade= Eugene M O'Neill, Publisher The two partners ran the paper until O'Neill's death in 1877. Following O'Neill's death, Eugene M O'Neill, Daniel's brother, took a more leading role in the paper along with Rook. E. M. O'Neill continued his brother's independent approach to political and civic issues which the public enjoyed. The same year as Daniel's death, 1877, the firm suffered the loss of the printing plant due to fire. O'Neill replaced the rotary press with a state-of-the-art \\"perfecting press\\" which could print both sides of the paper at the same time. They simultaneously reduced the size of the printed sheet and doubled the number of pages. The smaller size and greater bulk made the Dispatch stand out from the competition most of whom were using the older blanket press in a broad sheet format. Another advantage gained by introducing new technology came from the press' ability to print and fold the paper. Boys who once were used to fold in the printing plant were sent into the street to sell the paper, redoubling the publisher's marketing effort. O'Neill led the Pittsburgh papers on the news gathering side of the operation. At this time most newspapers relied on the Associated Press newswire for their national news. Consequently, all papers were printing the same stories word for word. O'Neill reinvested the savings realized from his advanced presses and engaged correspondents in Washington and the other news centers around the country. The result was a fresher perspective and different stories from competitive papers. This advantage showed particularly in the hotly contested presidential election of 1880 which saw James A. Garfield elected. =Eugene M O'Neill years= Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline When Alexander Rook died in 1880 Eugene M O'Neill took control of the paper and its editorial direction and eventually bought full ownership from Rook's estate. E.M. continued in charge of both the editorial and business departments for the next 12 years. The paper began publishing a Sunday edition on 9 September 1883, targeting the leisure time of its audience on that day, and justifying its higher price by providing more in-depth articles and a wider selection than the daily paper. The strategy was an instant success. An earlier attempt at a Sunday paper, in 1870, had failed in the same year. Ownership of the paper was reorganized in corporate form under the title \\"The Dispatch Publishing Company\\" in 1888 with E.M. O'Neill as President, Bakewell Phillips, Treasurer, and C.A. Rook, Secretary. Phillips was the son of Ormby Phillips who was part owner of the paper until his death in 1884. Phillips, a former mayor of the City of Allegheny had been the business manager of the firm. Eugene O'Neill continued to oversee the paper until his retirement in 1902. Alexander Rook's son, Charles A Rook, purchased control of the corporation and took over as President and editor-in-chief of the paper, Eugene O'Neill became Vice President, and Daniel O'Neill's son Florence became Treasurer. In 1908 Charles Wakefield Cadman became the music editor and critic for the Dispatch.Charles Wakefield Cadman Biography. Listen to Classical Music by Charles Wakefield Cadman =Paper shortage= The entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 began a period of paper shortages, especially newsprint. According to The Bureau of Business Research at Northwestern University the price of newsprint doubled between 1916 and 1917. Making matters worse was an increasingly difficult task of sourcing paper at all for the next 5 years. Matters came to a head in 1920 when a number of newspapers nationwide simply couldn't source newsprint at all and had to publish extremely truncated editions. In 1940 the price of newsprint doubled again, reaching a level 4 times higher than the pre-war price. On 23 March the paper appeared with 86 news headlines on the front page and virtually no advertising except for customers under contract. The paper shortage was not caused by a decrease in nationwide production, which had been steadily rising, instead the strong post World War I economy and the attendant advertising boom caused an increase in demand which the paper mills could not meet. In 1921 the paper had a circulation of 56,857. =Closure and liquidation= The combination of rapidly rising costs and higher spending on new press technology led to a trend toward industry consolidation in the 1910s and 1920s. Multi-city newspaper syndicates, such as Scripps-Howard bought up independent papers and either consolidated them or closed them to cut costs. The days of a large city having 5 or 10 local papers was drawing to a close. The Pittsburgh Dispatch published its last issue on 14 February 1923, its property, plant, and goodwill having been sold to the other Pittsburgh papers: the Pittsburgh Post, The Gazette Times and the Pittsburgh Press. The circulation of the paper was merged with the other papers, and the Rook Building at 1331-1335 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh was sold. The paper's membership in the Associated Press was transferred to the Pittsburgh Sun. The papers taking over the Dispatch also took over the assets of the Pittsburgh Leader at around the same time.

He is most remembered for turning Ptolemy against his sister and co-ruler Cleopatra, thus starting a civil war, and for having Pompey decapitated and presenting the severed head to Julius Caesar. When Ptolemy XII died in 51 BC, his will stated that Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII were to become co-rulers of Egypt, with the Roman Republic as their guardians. Ptolemy XIII was underage and Pothinus was appointed as his regent. The general Achillas and the rhetorician Theodotus of Chios were also guardians of the Egyptian king. When Ptolemy and Cleopatra were elevated to the status of senior rulers, Pothinus was maintained as the former's regent. Most Egyptologists believed that Pothinus used his influence to turn Ptolemy against Cleopatra. In the spring of 48 BC, Ptolemy, under Pothinus' guidance, attempted to depose Cleopatra in order to become sole ruler while Pothinus planned to act as the power behind the throne. They gained control of Alexandria, then the capital of Egypt, and forced Cleopatra out of the city. She soon organized her own army and a civil war began in Egypt, while Arsinoe IV also began to claim the throne for herself. Rome was also enveloped in civil war, and after his defeat in the Battle of Pharsalus Pompey sought asylum in Egypt. Initially, Pothinus pretended to have accepted his request, but on September 29, 48 BC, Pothinus had the general murdered, hoping to win favor with Julius Caesar, who had defeated Pompey. When Caesar arrived, he was presented with the head of Pompey, but he responded with grief and disgust and ordered that Pompey's body be located and given a proper Roman funeral. Pothinus had neglected to note that Caesar had been granting clemency to his enemies, including Cassius, Cicero, and Brutus. Cleopatra used Pothinus's mistake to gain favor with Caesar and eventually became his lover. Caesar then arranged for the execution of Pothinus and the marriage of Cleopatra to Ptolemy. In the very last chapter of Commentarii de Bello Civili, however, it is described that Pothinus arranged for Achillas to attack Alexandria and upon sending a message not to hesitate but to fulfill the plan, the messengers were exposed, whereupon Caesar had Pothinus imprisoned and killed, probably with a knife. His death was shortly followed by the ten-month siege of Alexandria. Depictions Unfortunately, only Roman and Greek sources have mentioned Pothinus. He is thus criticized for his murder of Pompey and his insidious behavior with regard to Caesar, while both measures are generally believed to have served to keep Egypt out of Caesar's Civil War. As it happened, however, Caesar came to emerge as the sole credible contender for his position of power, with Pompey dead and a Roman protectorate installed in Egypt.Konrat Ziegler: Potheinos 1). In: Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft (RE), vol. XXII, 1 (1953), col. 1177 Pothinus's brief role and death have been depicted more fancifully in dramatic literature. * In George Bernard Shaw's play Caesar and Cleopatra, Cleopatra arranges to have him secretly murdered by her female servant Ftatateeta after he embarrasses her (Cleopatra) in front of Caesar by telling him that she longs for his departure from Egypt so that she can rule alone. He is killed offstage. In the 1945 film based on this play, Caesar and Cleopatra, he was portrayed by Francis L. Sullivan, and in a 1976 television version of the play, he was portrayed by Noel Willman. * In Cecil B. DeMille's 1934 film Cleopatra, in which he was portrayed by Leonard Mudie, Cleopatra kills him herself, after realizing that he is hiding behind a curtain, ready to murder Caesar. * In the 1963 film Cleopatra, starring Elizabeth Taylor, he was portrayed by Gr√©goire Aslan. Pothinus tries to poison Cleopatra, but the plot is discovered in time, whereupon he is put on trial (with no witnesses testifying), pronounced guilty, and sentenced to death by Caesar. Cleopatra's faithful male servant Apollodorus follows Pothinus and the small procession of guards as they exit the room, and within a few seconds an off-screen death scream is heard. One of the returning guards approaches Caesar and gives him a dagger. Caesar then summons his servant Flavius and hands him the dagger with the words, \\"Please return this to Apollodorus. You might clean it first; it has Pothinus all over it.\\" * Pothinus is depicted, portrayed by David Foxxe, in the 2002 TV miniseries Julius Caesar, as he pretends to welcome Pompey but rather silently orders for him to be assassinated by his own guards, and later welcomes Caesar, in the famous gift scene. He is later mentioned by Cleopatra while explaining the Civil War to Caesar. * In \\"Caesarion\\", an episode of the television series Rome (2005‚Äì07), Pothinus is portrayed by actor Tony Guilfoyle; he is beheaded by the Romans and his head is placed on a spike on the outer wall of the palace. * In The Judgment of Caesar (part of the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor) he is forced to drink poisoned wine by Caesar. * Pothinus is a character in Assassin's Creed Origins, where he is depicted as one of the leaders of the Order of the Ancients, a precursor organization to the Knights Templar.

Circular helicate [(Fe5L5)Cl]9+, where L stands for s tris-bpy ligand strand; the central gray atom is Cl, while the smaller gray spheres are Fe. A supramolecular assembly is a complex of molecules held together by noncovalent bonds. While a supramolecular assembly can be simply composed of two molecules (e.g., a DNA double helix or an inclusion compound), or a defined number of stoichiometrically interacting molecules within a quaternary complex, it is more often used to denote larger complexes composed of indefinite numbers of molecules that form sphere-, rod-, or sheet-like species. Colloids, liquid crystals, biomolecular condensates, micelles, liposomes and biological membranes are examples of supramolecular assemblies. The dimensions of supramolecular assemblies can range from nanometers to micrometers. Thus they allow access to nanoscale objects using a bottom-up approach in far fewer steps than a single molecule of similar dimensions. The process by which a supramolecular assembly forms is called molecular self-assembly. Some try to distinguish self-assembly as the process by which individual molecules form the defined aggregate. Self-organization, then, is the process by which those aggregates create higher-order structures. This can become useful when talking about liquid crystals and block copolymers. Templating reactions 18-crown-6 can be synthesized from using potassium ion as the template cation Illustrations of a. metal-organic frameworks and b. supramolecular coordination complexes As studied in coordination chemistry, metal ions (usually transition metal ions) exist in solution bound to ligands, In many cases, the coordination sphere defines geometries conducive to reactions either between ligands or involving ligands and other external reagents. A well known metal-ion-templating was described by Charles Pederson in his synthesis of various crown ethers using metal cations as template. For example, 18-crown-6 strongly coordinates potassium ion thus can be prepared through the Williamson ether synthesis using potassium ion as the template metal. Metal ions are frequently used for assembly of large supramolecular structures. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one example. MOFs are infinite structures where metal serve as nodes to connect organic ligands together. SCCs are discrete systems where selected metals and ligands undergo self- assembly to form finite supramolecular complexes, usually the size and structure of the complex formed can be determined by the angularity of chosen metal-ligand bonds.

(b) Hydrogen bond network in cyanuric acid-melamine crystals. Hydrogen bond- assisted supramolecular assembly is the process of assembling small organic molecules to form large supramolecular structures by non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions. The directionality, reversibility, and strong bonding nature of hydrogen bond make it an attractive and useful approach in supramolecular assembly. Functional groups such as carboxylic acids, ureas, amines, and amides are commonly used to assemble higher order structures upon hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bond play an essential role in the assembly of secondary and tertiary structures of large biomolecules. DNA double helix is formed by hydrogen bonding between nucleobases: adenine and thymine forms two hydrogen bonds, while guanine and cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds (Figure \\"Hydrogen bonds in (a) DNA duplex formation\\"). Another prominent example of hydrogen bond-assisted assembly in nature is the formation of protein secondary structures. Both the Œ±-helix and Œ≤-sheet are formed through hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogen and the amide carbonyl oxygen (Figure \\"Hydrogen bonds in (b) protein Œ≤-sheet structure\\"). In supramolecular chemistry, hydrogen bonds have been broadly applied to crystal engineering, molecular recognition, and catalysis. Hydrogen bonds are among the mostly used synthons in bottom-up approach to engineering molecular interactions in crystals. Representative hydrogen bond patterns for supramolecular assembly is shown in Figure \\"Representative hydrogen bond patterns in supramolecular assembly\\". A 1: 1 mixture of cyanuric acid and melamine forms crystal with a highly dense hydrogen-bonding network. This supramolecular aggregates has been used as templates to engineering other crystal structures. Applications Supramolecular assemblies have no specific applications but are the subject of many intriguing reactions. A supramolecular assembly of peptide amphiphiles in the form of nanofibers has been shown to promote the growth of neurons. An advantage to this supramolecular approach is that the nanofibers will degrade back into the individual peptide molecules that can be broken down by the body. By self-assembling of dendritic dipeptides, hollow cylinders can be produced. The cylindrical assemblies possess internal helical order and self- organize into columnar liquid crystalline lattices. When inserted into vesicular membranes, the porous cylindrical assemblies mediate transport of protons across the membrane. Self-assembly of dendrons generates arrays of nanowires. Electron donor-acceptor complexes comprise the core of the cylindrical supramolecular assemblies, which further self-organize into two- dimensional columnar liquid crystaline lattices. Each cylindrical supramolecular assembly functions as an individual wire. High charge carrier mobilities for holes and electrons were obtained.

It is the largest Indian reservation in that state by land area. The reservation includes all of Mahnomen County, plus parts of Becker and Clearwater counties in the northwest part of the state, along the Wild Rice and White Earth rivers. It is about 225 miles (362 km) from Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul and roughly 65 miles (105 km) from Fargo‚ÄìMoorhead. Community members often prefer to identify as Anishinaabe or Ojibwe rather than Chippewa, a corruption of Ojibwe that came to be used by European settlers to refer to them. The reservation's land area is 1,093 sq mi (2,831 km¬≤), and its population was 9,192 as of the 2000 U.S. census. The White Earth Indian Reservation is one of six bands that make up the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, their governing body for major administrative needs. The Band issues its own reservation license plates to vehicles. Reservation flag The White Earth Reservation was created on March 19, 1867, during a treaty () signing in Washington, DC. Ten Ojibwe Indian chiefs met with President Andrew Johnson at the White House to negotiate the treaty. The chiefs (White Cloud), a Gull Lake Mississippi Chippewa, and Fine Day, of the Removable Mille Lacs Indians, were among the first to move with their followers to White Earth in 1868. The reservation originally covered 1,300 square miles (3,400 km¬≤). Much of the community's land was improperly sold or seized by outside interests, including the U.S. federal government, in the late 19th century and early 20th century. According to the Dawes Act of 1887, the communal land was to be allotted to individual households recorded in tribal rolls, for cultivation in subsistence farming. Under the act, the remainder was declared surplus and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The Nelson Act of 1889 was a corollary law that enabled the land to be divided and sold to non-Natives. In the latter half of the 20th century, the federal government arranged for the transfer of state and county land to the reservation in compensation for other property that had been lost. In 1989, Winona LaDuke formed the White Earth Land Recovery Project, which has slowly been acquiring land privately held to add back to the value of the non-profit 501(c)(3) to be used for collateral. At that time, less than 10% of the land within the reservation boundaries was owned by tribal members. The White Earth Band government operates the Shooting Star Casino, Hotel and Event center in Mahnomen, Minnesota. The entertainment and gambling complex employs over 1000 tribal and non-tribal staff, with a new location in Bagley, Minnesota. History Family and goods in a wagon on the White Earth Reservation, 1934 Originally, the United States wanted to relocate all Anishinaabe people from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota to the White Earth Reservation in the western part of Minnesota. It planned to open the land of the vacated reservations to sale and settlement by European Americans. The US government even proposed relocating the Dakota people to the White Earth Reservation, although the two peoples had been traditional enemies since the Anishinaabe had invaded their land in the late 18th century. The US continued to promote this policy until 1898. Before the Nelson Act of 1889 took effect, groups of Anishinaabe and Dakota peoples began to relocate to the White Earth Reservation from other Minnesota Chippewa and Dakota reservations. The 1920 census details provide data on the origins of the Anishinabe people living on the White Earth Reservation, as they indicated their original bands. There were 4,856 from the Mississippi Band of Chippewa (well over 1,000 had come from Mille Lacs, and many were Dakota); the Pillagers numbered 1,218; the Pembina Band were 472; and 113 were from the Fond du Lac and Superior Chippewa bands. On July 8, 1889, the United States broke treaty promises; it told the Minnesota Chippewa that Red Lake Reservation and White Earth Reservation would remain, but that the others would be eradicated. It also told them the Chippewa from the other Reservations would be relocated to White Earth Reservation. Instead of dealing with the Chippewa of Minnesota on a nation-to- nation level, the United States put decisions about communal land use to a vote of tribal members. It said that the decision to accept land allotments under the Dawes Act would be settled by a vote of individual adult Chippewa males, rather than allowing the tribe to make a decision according to their own traditions of council. Included in the decision to allow allotment was that lands classified as surplus, after all households received allotments, would be declared 'surplus' and could be sold to non-Chippewa, namely, the European Americans. Chippewa leaders were outraged. They knew they could count on the average Anishinaabe adult male to obey the council's decision. But, included in the voting were many Dakota men, who were not part of their tribe. The Chippewa also mistrusted administration of the vote; the whites, who had an interest in allotment, counted the total number of votes, rather than the Chippewa. Red Lake leaders warned the United States about reprisals if their Reservation was violated. The White Earth and Mille Lacs reservations overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and allow surplus land sold to the whites. Supposedly the Leech Lake Reservation's men also overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and have the Reservation surplus land sold to the whites. The events of October 1898 indicate otherwise. At the time (1889), the White Earth Reservation covered 1,093 sq. mi. After the votes were counted, the whites claimed that voting men had overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and have the Reservations surplus land sold to the whites. After this process, only a small portion of the White Earth Reservation remained. It was located in the northeast part of the White Earth Reservation and was only a fraction of the original size. All other Minnesota Chippewa reservations were closed and emptied of Native Americans. The rebellion which occurred on the Leech Lake Reservation in 1898 saved Minnesota's Chippewa reservations, including the White Earth Reservation and probably the Red Lake Reservation, and the Chippewa reservations of Wisconsin. White Earth, like the Red Lake and Leech Lake reservations, is known for its tradition of singing hymns in the Ojibwe language. Communities White Earth Reservation has many settlements located within its borders. Some are predominantly non-Indian, or include a large percentage of mixed-bloods. Today, how individuals live in terms of their culture often determines whether they are considered Ojibwe. According to tradition, the Ojibwe had a patrilineal society in which inheritance and descent was passed down paternal lines. Children were considered born into their father's clan and took their social status from his people. At one time, children who had white fathers were not considered Ojibwe; such children had no formal place in the tribe unless they were adopted by a male of the tribe, as their biological father did not belong to a tribal clan. Over time, many unions were made among Ojibwe and Europeans, typically of European males and Ojibwe women. Their mixed-race descendants have taken a variety of roles: some bridging the cultures; others identifying with one or the other. The questions of ancestry and style of life continue to be contentious. Predominantly, Indian settlements include Elbow Lake; Naytahwaush, the largest Indian community on the Reservation; Pine Point; Rice Lake; Twin Lakes; and White Earth, which is the second-largest Indian settlement on the Reservation. The following communities are considered to have predominantly Indian populations when their mixed-blood residents are included, whether or not those are enrolled tribal members: Waubun, Ogema, and Callaway. The largest community is Mahnomen, which is predominantly non-Indian in population. Tiny settlements that are likely predominantly Native American include Mahkonce, which is very rural; Maple Grove Township; Pine Bend; Roy Lake, a popular tourist and vacation destination; and the region around Strawberry Lake, which is also popular with vacationers. In July 2007, according to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, the total number of enrolled members of the White Earth Reservation is 19,291. Most members live off- Reservation, particularly those of Dakota ancestry. Some live in Minneapolis or other cities that offer more economic prospects. *Beaulieu *Bejou *Callaway *Elbow Lake *Mahnomen *Midway *Naytahwaush *Ogema *Pine Bend *Pine Point *Rice Lake *Roy Lake *South End *The Ranch *Twin Lakes *Waubun *West Roy Lake *White Earth Demographics The population of the White Earth Reservation is predominantly white, as the Nelson Acts permitted sales of land to non- Natives. The 2000 census reported a population of 9,192 for the White Earth Reservation. The Native American population was reported as 3,378, much less than that at the Leech Lake Reservation. When including mixed heritage Ojibwe people and Hispanics, the Native American population is 4,154. The white population was reported as 5,205. The chairwoman of the White Earth Reservation says that the Indian populations of reservations are higher than counted during censuses. She said that many Reservation families had more than one family sharing the same residence, and these were not always counted. In some cases up to three families shared the same residence. During census counts, the extra families will likely not participate for fear of being evicted from their homes. It may be that the population of the White Earth Band is larger than that of whites on the reservation. Economy White Earth Reservation has an economy which is similar to other Native American reservations. In 2011, the government of the White Earth Reservation employed nearly 1,750 employees. The tribal payroll was near $21 million. The government of the White Earth Reservation employs non-Indians as well as Chippewa from off the reservation in order to fill its staffing needs. The White Earth Reservation owns and operates an Event Center, a hotel, the Shooting Star Casino, the White Earth Housing Authority, the Reservations College, and other business enterprises. The poverty rate on the White Earth Reservation may be near 50%. The unemployment rate on the White Earth Reservation is near 25%. The White Earth Reservation is classified as the poorest reservation in the State of Minnesota. Topography White Earth Reservation is situated in an area where the prairie meets the boreal forest. About half the Reservation is covered by a forest and lakes, with second- growth trees. In the late 19th century, lumber companies clear‚Äìcut much of the original forest that had covered the Reservation. The western part of the Reservation is prime prairie land. Many farms are located in this section. Another area of numerous farms is the extreme northeastern section of the Reservation. The most dense forest is situated between Callaway and Pine Point, on up to just west and north of Mahkonce. North of there, the forest becomes less dense, especially around the Pine Bend and Rice Lake regions. The region between Mahkonce and Pine Bend has a few farms. Many lakes dot the Reservation's land. Large lakes include Bass Lake; Big Rat Lake; Lower Rice Lake; Many Point Lake; North Twin Lake-South Twin Lake; Roy Lake; Round Lake; Snider Lake; Strawberry Lake; Tulaby Lake; and White Earth Lake. The White Earth Land Recovery Project encourages ownership of reservation land by members of the White Earth Band, as well as projects for reforestation and revival of the wild rice industry on the reservation's lakes. It sells a reservation brand of wild rice and other products. The White Earth Reservation holds the 160,000-acre White Earth State Forest. The Reservation's land is still recovering from the effects of the destruction which the lumber companies caused over a century ago. The Reservation is especially beautiful during the spring, summer and autumn. Climate Climate conditions on the White Earth Reservation are extreme. Winters are long and cold. During the months of December, January, and February, average low temperatures are 1, -6, and 0 at Mahnomen. Average high temperatures for the same winter months are 20, 14, and 21. The summer months of June, July, and August have high temperatures that average 76, 81, and 80 at Mahnomen. Average low temperatures during the same summer months are 52, 56, and 54 at Mahnomen. Precipitation is influenced by the forest and many lakes which are located within the Reservation's borders. Average yearly precipitation at Mahnomen is over 22 inches.

The line was financially troubled for its entire life span and declared bankruptcy after just six years of operation. It would spend the remaining 42 year of its existence in receivership or trusteeship, one of the longest bankruptcy proceedings in American railroading history. The Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad is often confused with the similarly named Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad which was a spinoff company from the PS&N.; Further adding to the confusion is the fact that both were nicknamed the Shawmut Line, both operated in roughly the same geographic area, and both used nearly identical logos during their history. In fact the two were completely separate companies after their 1916 split. The main line consisted of approximately 190 miles (306 km) of track extending from Brockway, Pennsylvania to Wayland, New York with several branches, particularly Olean, New York to Prosser, New York (a location on the southeastern edge of South Valley, New York) and Moraine, New York (a location on the eastern edge of Canaseraga, New York) to Hornell, New York. Principal shops were divided between Angelica, New York (car shop, paint shop, maintenance of way) and St. Marys, Pennsylvania (motive power shop). Each shop burned and was rebuilt. The Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad began life on August 2, 1899, as the merger of five small railroads in New York and Pennsylvania. of what ultimately became the PS&N; were originally narrow gauge lines, though by the time of the PS&N;'s incorporation only remained as narrow gauge. At the time of its incorporation the PS&N; operated four physically disconnected divisions. The expense of connecting the divisions and upgrading the physical plant to handle through coal trains coupled with the failure of the PS&N;'s principal bond underwriter forced the company to declare bankruptcy in 1905. The company would continue to operate in receivership until 1946 when the bankruptcy was converted to a trusteeship. The spelling of Pittsburgh as Pittsburg in the company name derives from the company‚Äôs original 1899 charter. At the time, the name of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was commonly spelled without the h. The United States Board on Geographic Names advocated the h-less spelling from 1891 to 1911 as part of an effort to standardize the spelling of place names in the United States. The more lucrative Brockway to Freeport route was constructed beginning in 1903 as the Brookville & Mahoning. Confusion with the Boston & Maine caused the name to be changed to the Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad. The P&S; was leased (but never owned) by the PS&N; from 1906 until 1916. After 1916, the lease was terminated and the two companies operated separately. During the time of the lease, the bigger \\"200 class\\" 2-8-2s of the P&S; operated over the combined systems. Coal (bituminous) was the principal commodity for the line during its entire existence, though passenger trains and, after the late 1920s, self- propelled gas-powered motor cars (known on the PS&N; as \\"Hoodlebugs\\") also ran on the route until they were discontinued in 1935. In the early 1930s, the final years of service, the railroad's passenger service on its full mainline route was segmented. Train 9 southbound (10 northbound) traveled as a passenger train from Wayland, New York to Prosser, New York. At Prosser, passengers traveling the full route south would switch to a motor car in Train 11 southbound (12 northbound) which began its trip on a side branch from Olean. This motor car train would continue south to St. Marys, whereupon southbound travelers would transfer to Train 1, another motor car train, for the final trip to Brockway. This trip would involve an overnight layover in St. Marys between a 6:45 pm arrival and #1's 8:00 am departure. Travelers heading northbound would need to make an overnight stop at Prosser, as #12 from Brockway arrived in Prosser at 1:30 pm and #10 bound for Wayland would depart Prosser at 6:39 am.'Official Guide of the Railways of North America,' February 1930, Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad section, p. 137 PS&N; operations ended effective April 1, 1947. Portions of the line serving Olean, Brandy Camp, and Farmers Valley were acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad (the Farmers Valley portion is today owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and operated by the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad). The Erie Railroad acquired the PS&N;'s Hornell Terminals in a complex transaction from the American National Red Cross, which had been gifted ownership of the Rochester, Hornellsville & Lackawanna Railroad, an 11-mile-long railroad leased to and operated by the PS&N; and predecessors prior to 1946.

The lake has an area of , of shoreline with a little under three miles of paved walking and biking paths, and a maximum depth of . Some of the stately homes around Lake of the Isles The lake seen from the south in July, with birdlife sanctuary islands on the left and right Lake of the Isles is known for its two wooded islands, its long north arm, and the surrounding stately houses of the Kenwood, Lowry Hill, and East Isles neighborhoods. The lake was named for small islands that used to exist in the lake, wetlands area, and was used from the earliest days of settlement of Minneapolis. At one time the lake contained four small islands, but two of them, near the south shore of the lake, were converted to parkland as the lake was developed and dredged to its current shape and size. The two remaining wooded islands, Mike's Island in the north and Raspberry Island, are protected wildlife refuges which contain virgin woods. Landing on either of the islands is prohibited, as marked by signs. The lake was created in its current form in the early 20th century by dredging a small lake, called Wita Tomna (\\"four islands lake\\") by the local Dakota people, and an adjacent marsh. The dredged materials‚Äîmostly peat and silt‚Äîwere used to create about of parkland around the lake and the two islands in the middle of the lake. The settling of these materials and the pressure of urban development led to an unstable shoreline and reduced water quality. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is engaged in a multiyear project to stabilize the shoreline, renovate the parkland, and construct twelve stone points of access to the lake. Fish The lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, common carp, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, tiger muskellunge, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some guideline restrictions have been placed on the consumption of bluegill, carp, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch from the lake, because of contamination with mercury and PFOS.

It was the first infill station added to an existing line on the Singapore MRT network. It is also the first elevated station in Singapore with two side platforms on either side of the tracks, as opposed to having an island platform commonly found in other elevated MRT stations. A similar layout was adopted at Canberra MRT station. As the second above-ground MRT station built in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, it has a distinctive architectural design. Like most projects of this period, the use of glass and steel is extensive. Dover station provides MRT access to students and staff of Singapore Polytechnic, as well as residents of the nearby Mount Sinai and Dover estates. History An exterior view of the Dover MRT station, which was built around existing elevated railway track and has overpasses leading to Singapore Polytechnic and bus stops on both sides of the road. Dover MRT Station was announced on 28 July 1997. Adjacent to the Singapore Polytechnic on one side, and undeveloped land on the other, the building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over the small area it serviced when construction began in June 1998. There were criticisms over the spending of \\"taxpayers' money\\" chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution. The Land Transport Authority, the government department in charge of public transport operations, proceeded with the construction anyway, to serve commuters along Singapore Polytechnic with Dover housing estate. Originally, the station was named Polytechnic in the planning stage. With the change of plans, it was renamed to Dover, after the nearby Dover Road. Originally, the station was not assigned a station code. On 18 July 2001, with the introduction of the new MRT map, including new station codes, Dover was assigned with EW22. Trains were running slower due to the construction. There were test runs from 13 to 17 October 2001 when the trains stopped at this station but did not open their doors. Shuttle buses were provided from this station to National University Hospital (NUH), previously from Buona Vista. However, services ceased with effect from 1 November 2011 due to the opening of Kent Ridge MRT station on the Circle line, which is located within NUH premises. Half height platform screen doors (HHPSD) were installed in this station and they became operational on 5 August 2011. Incidents On 19 September 2009, a retiree Muhammad Osmail Paiman, 61, was pulled out to safety after he fell onto the MRT tracks at the station. A similar incident happened the next day when a retiree Carolyn Quek was saved by a man. The retiree felt giddy and fell into the tracks.

The hotel has two different buildings. The Sassoon House, originally housed the Cathay Hotel and is today the Fairmont Peace Hotel run by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Canada. The South Building was built as the Palace Hotel and is today a residence and studio for artists, known as The Swatch Art Peace Hotel. The two buildings both face the Bund, but are divided by Nanjing Road. North Building The south building on the left, north building on the right The larger North Building is called Sassoon House. The building was built by Sir Victor Sassoon, of the Sassoon family, which built a Shanghai business and real estate empire in the early 20th century. He was a British Sephardic Jew of Iraqi origin, educated at Harrow School and Cambridge University. His family owned the trading company \\"E.D. Sassoon & Co.\\", which managed extensive business interests in Bombay, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Sassoon House was the first high-rise building built by Victor Sassoon, and one of the first skyscrapers in the Eastern Hemisphere. It was designed by architects Palmer and Turner, with a reinforced concrete structure. Construction began in 1926, and was completed in 1929. The building occupies 4,617 square meters (49,697 square feet), and offers 36,317 square meters (390,913 square feet) of floor space. The building is ten stories in height, and the tenth floor is a penthouse, where Victor Sassoon once lived. The North Building is 77 meters (253 feet) high to the roofline, and 83 meters (272 feet) to the spire. The builders followed a consistent art deco scheme, from exterior design to interior decor. Most of the building features granite facing, while the ninth floor and the roof are surfaced with terracotta. The eastern facade (facing the Huangpu River and the Bund) features a pyramidal roof with steep sides, and a height of about 10 meters (33 feet). The pyramid is faced with copper, which has corroded to light green. Banks and shops leased the ground floor space until 1949. This space became the Shanghai branch of Citibank in 2002. The fourth through ninth floors once housed the Cathay Hotel. After the Communist takeover in 1949, some of the offices were used by the Municipal Finance Committee. In 1952, the building was taken over by the Municipal Government. In 1956, it once again became a hotel under the name \\"Peace Hotel\\". During the Cultural Revolution, the hotel was used by the Gang of Four, most famously by Zhang Chunqiao as he headed the Shanghai Commune from headquarters in the Peace Hotel. Its Old Jazz Band was recently the basis for a movie, \\"As Time Goes By\\" a film by Uli Gaulke. Its roof terrace restaurant overlooks the district of Pudong across the Huangpu. This hotel was also used as an inspiration for Vicki Baum's 1937 novel \\"Shanghai '37\\", also known as \\"Hotel Shanghai\\" and \\"Nanjing Road\\". In 2007, the hotel closed for a three-year renovation of both the exterior and interior, including the guest rooms, the lobby, and the dining and entertainment venues. The North Building reopened in 2010, as the Fairmont Peace Hotel Shanghai. The hotel now offers 270 guestrooms and 39 suites, including Victor's Caf√©, named for Sir Victor Sassoon. The eighth floor hosts the Peace Hall, plus several meeting rooms, and an outdoor terrace. A low-rise extension has been added to the rear of the hotel, housing guestrooms, a swimming pool, and spa. South Building The Swatch Art Peace Hotel Separated from the North Building by Nanjing Road, the South Building dates back to the 1850s, when it was known as the Central Hotel. In 1903, the hotel was restructured and renamed the Palace Hotel. The building that stands today was completed in 1908, and offered two elevators, the first building in Shanghai to do so. It was also once home to a Kuhn & Komor shop. The hotel occupies , with a floor space of . It has a brick veneer, with its six stories reaching in height. The exterior is in a Renaissance style. The hotel has eighteen artist residences and seven guest rooms. In 1911, after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen stayed at the hotel and advocated commitment to the revolutionary cause. During World War II, the building was occupied by the Japanese army. In 1947 it was purchased by a Chinese company. After the revolution in 1949, it continued operations until 1952, when it was confiscated and used by the Municipal Construction Department. In 1965 it resumed operations as a hotel, as a wing of the Peace Hotel. Similar to its counterpart to the north, the South Building was renovated in preparation for the 2010 World Expo. It emerged as The Swatch Art Peace Hotel. It hosts artists from around the world who live and work for a limited time in apartments/workshops. The heritage facade and public rooms of the building have been restored.

This station is located along Changi South Avenue 1 at the junction of Expo Drive, in between Changi City Point and the Singapore Expo, in the Tampines planning area, Singapore. The station is part of the current two- station branch line which extends from Tanah Merah to Changi Airport station. The plans to connect to Changi Airport were finalised in 1996 and construction began in 1999. The station opened on 10 January 2001, a year earlier than the Changi Airport station. It later became the terminus for the DTL upon the completion of Stage 3 of the line in 2017. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line (TEL) as it extends to the airport's Terminal 5 by 2040. History =Changi Airport Branch= EWL platforms of Expo station In 1994, there were plans to build a new rail connection to Changi Airport. The two-station branch, which included Expo station, was finalised through an announcement by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996. The contract 502 for the constriction of Expo station was awarded to Penta-Ocean Construction Limited, which completed the station in 2000. As part of the President's Challenge 2001, a part of a charity walk goes through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations. The station opened on 10 January 2001 on the request by Singapore Expo, a year before the opening of the Changi Airport station. The branch line later extended to Changi Airport when the station opened on 8 February 2002. As with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the EWL, the station was built without platform screen doors. Installation of the half-height screen doors (PSDs) started on 20 June 2011 and finished on 31 August, the last station on the EWL to have PSDs installed. =Downtown line= Downtown line platforms of Expo station On 20 August 2010, it was announced that the Stage 3 of the DTL will terminate and interchange with the EWL at Expo station.Downtown Line 3 station Locations Unveiled .

On 28 November 2011, LTA marked the start of construction of Stage 3 of the DTL with a groundbreaking ceremony at this station. To facilitate the construction for the Downtown line 3 Expo station and its tunnels, part of Changi South Avenue 1 towards Somapah Road and Changi South Avenue 2, together with a short section of Expo Drive were temporarily closed to traffic from 2 October 2011 to May 2017. The construction of the DTL station also involves the underpinning of two existing Expo MRT viaduct pier foundations. A transfer- beam was constructed before the excavation to support the two pillars and hydraulic jacks were installed on the transfer beam. It was followed by the cutting away of the existing pilers. The underpinning works were carried out successfully without disruption to the EWL operations. On 31 May 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that the station, together with the rest of DTL3, will be opened on 21 October that year. Passengers were offered a preview of the station along with the other Downtown Line 3 (DTL 3) stations at the DTL 3 Open House on 15 October. =Incorporation into the TEL= On 25 May 2019, the LTA announced an extension of the (TEL) to Changi Airport. Set to be completed by 2040, The TEL will be extended from its current terminus at Sungei Bedok MRT station to serve the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and the stretch between Tanah Merah and Changi Airport, which is currently part of the East‚ÄìWest line, will be transferred over to the Thomson-East Coast line. Station details =Architecture= Exterior view of the EWL station The elevated EWL station is designed by British architectural firm Foster and Partners. The station features two roofs overlapping one another ‚Äî a stainless-steel roof over the concourse and ticket level in diameter, and a long titanium roof stretching over the platform level. The former reflects sunlight into the concourse which minimises the need for artificial lighting, while the latter deflects sun rays, which cools the platform by up to four degrees less than its surroundings. These materials for the roof were adapted to fit into warm tropical Singaporean climate. The spacious interior of the station allows natural lighting and ventilation. Its futuristic design reflects the country's willingness to experiment with new ideas and technology, symbolising the \\"thriving world-class city\\" that Singapore was building for in the 21st century. =Services= Exit A of the station leading to the DTL and EWL platforms The station is an interchange station on the EWL and DTL. On the EWL, the station is between the Tanah Merah and Changi Airport stations on the Changi Airport branch. Train services to Expo station initially operated as a 2-station shuttle service from Tanah Merah station, then briefly converted to a through service from Boon Lay station when the branch extended to Changi Airport station. However, due to ridership falling below expectations, the service was reverted into shuttle mode on 22 July 2003. On the DTL, the station is the current terminus on the line, with the next station being Upper Changi station. When the DTL extends to Sungei Bedok in 2024, the next station will be Xilin station. =Art in transit= An artwork titled \\"A Banquet\\" by Yeo Chee Kiong is featured at the DTL station as part of the MRT network's Art-in-Transit programme. The massive 3D artwork depicts two reflective isometric chairs and a bulbous speech balloon to signify not only the importance of organic communication in an era of technological advancement and digital media but also the spirit of free trade. According to the sculptor, \\"Expo is where business is done, the speech balloons show the kind of conversations and dialogues which people have, and the chairs show where business takes place.\\" With the surrounding colours of the station reflected in the artwork's shiny surfaces, it transformed them into two sets of magnificent kaleidoscopes which also symbolises cultural exchange.

The combustion may take place in a controlled manner such as in an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace, or may result in an explosion (e.g., a dust explosion, gas or vapour explosion or in a thermobaric weapon). The air-fuel ratio determines whether a mixture is combustible at all, how much energy is being released, and how much unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and upper explosive limits. In an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace, the air-fuel ratio is an important measure for anti- pollution and performance-tuning reasons. If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel, the ratio is known as the stoichiometric mixture, often abbreviated to stoich. Ratios lower than stoichiometric are considered \\"rich.\\" Rich mixtures are less efficient, but may produce more power and burn cooler. Ratios higher than stoichiometric are considered \\"lean.\\" Lean mixtures are more efficient but may cause higher temperatures, which can lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides. Some engines are designed with features to allow lean-burn. For precise air-fuel ratio calculations, the oxygen content of combustion air should be specified because of different air density due to different altitude or intake air temperature, possible dilution by ambient water vapor, or enrichment by oxygen additions.  Internal combustion engines In theory a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. In practice this is never quite achieved, due primarily to the very short time available in an internal combustion engine for each combustion cycle. Most of the combustion process is completed in approximately 2 milliseconds at an engine speed of . (100 revolutions per second; 10 milliseconds per revolution of crank shaft - which for a four stroke engine would mean typically 5 millisecond for each piston stroke). This is the time that elapses from the spark plug firing until 90% of the fuel‚Äìair mix is combusted, typically some 80 degrees of crankshaft rotation later. Catalytic converters are designed to work best when the exhaust gases passing through them are the result of nearly perfect combustion. A stoichiometric mixture unfortunately burns very hot and can damage engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel‚Äìair mixture. Due to the high temperatures at this mixture, detonation of the fuel‚Äìair mix while approaching or shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible under high load (referred to as knocking or pinging), specifically a \\"pre-detonation\\" event in the context of a spark-ignition engine model. Such detonation can cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder. As a consequence, stoichiometric mixtures are only used under light to low-moderate load conditions. For acceleration and high-load conditions, a richer mixture (lower air‚Äìfuel ratio) is used to produce cooler combustion products and so avoid overheating of the cylinder head, and thereby prevent detonation. Engine management systems The stoichiometric mixture for a gasoline engine is the ideal ratio of air to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess air. For gasoline fuel, the stoichiometric air‚Äìfuel mixture is about 14.7:1 i.e. for every one gram of fuel, 14.7 grams of air are required. For pure octane fuel, the oxidation reaction is: :25 O2 \\\\+ 2 C8H18 ‚Üí 16 CO2 \\\\+ 18 H2O + energy Any mixture greater than 14.7:1 is considered a lean mixture; any less than 14.7:1 is a rich mixture ‚Äì given perfect (ideal) \\"test\\" fuel (gasoline consisting of solely n-heptane and iso-octane). In reality, most fuels consist of a combination of heptane, octane, a handful of other alkanes, plus additives including detergents, and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) or ethanol/methanol. These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio, with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward (oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at time of combustions; for MTBE-laden fuel, a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as 14.1:1). Vehicles that use an oxygen sensor or other feedback loop to control fuel to air ratio (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different carburetor jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate. Vehicles that use oxygen sensors can monitor the air‚Äìfuel ratio with an air‚Äìfuel ratio meter.  Other types of engines  In the typical air to natural gas combustion burner, a double cross limit strategy is employed to ensure ratio control. (This method was used in World War II). The strategy involves adding the opposite flow feedback into the limiting control of the respective gas (air or fuel). This assures ratio control within an acceptable margin.  Other terms used  There are other terms commonly used when discussing the mixture of air and fuel in internal combustion engines. =Mixture= Mixture is the predominant word that appears in training texts, operation manuals and maintenance manuals in the aviation world. Air‚Äìfuel ratio is the ratio between the mass of air and the mass of fuel in the fuel‚Äìair mix at any given moment. The mass is the mass of all constituents that compose the fuel and air, whether combustible or not. For example, a calculation of the mass of natural gas‚Äîwhich often contains carbon dioxide (), nitrogen (), and various alkanes‚Äîincludes the mass of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and all alkanes in determining the value of mfuel.See Example 15.3 in For pure octane the stoichiometric mixture is approximately 15.1:1, or Œª of 1.00 exactly. In naturally aspirated engines powered by octane, maximum power is frequently reached at AFRs ranging from 12.5 to 13.3:1 or Œª of 0.850 to 0.901. Air-fuel ratio of 12:1 is considered as maximum output ratio, where as the air-fuel ratio of 16:1 is considered as maximum fuel economy ratio. = Fuel‚Äìair ratio (FAR) = Fuel‚Äìair ratio is commonly used in the gas turbine industry as well as in government studies of internal combustion engine, and refers to the ratio of fuel to the air. :\\\\mathrm{FAR} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{AFR}} = Air‚Äìfuel equivalence ratio (Œª) = Air‚Äìfuel equivalence ratio, Œª (lambda), is the ratio of actual AFR to stoichiometry for a given mixture. Œª = 1.0 is at stoichiometry, rich mixtures Œª < 1.0, and lean mixtures Œª > 1.0. There is a direct relationship between Œª and AFR. To calculate AFR from a given Œª, multiply the measured Œª by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. Alternatively, to recover Œª from an AFR, divide AFR by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. This last equation is often used as the definition of Œª: :\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{AFR}}{\\\\mathrm{AFR}_\\\\text{stoich}} Because the composition of common fuels varies seasonally, and because many modern vehicles can handle different fuels, when tuning, it makes more sense to talk about Œª values rather than AFR. Most practical AFR devices actually measure the amount of residual oxygen (for lean mixes) or unburnt hydrocarbons (for rich mixtures) in the exhaust gas. =Fuel‚Äìair equivalence ratio (œï)= The fuel‚Äìair equivalence ratio, œï (phi), of a system is defined as the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. Mathematically, : \\\\phi = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio}}{(\\\\mbox{fuel-to- oxidizer ratio})_\\\\text{st}} = \\\\frac{m_\\\\text{fuel}/m_\\\\text{ox}}{\\\\left(m_\\\\text{fuel}/m_\\\\text{ox}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st}} = \\\\frac{n_\\\\text{fuel}/n_\\\\text{ox}}{\\\\left(n_\\\\text{fuel}/n_\\\\text{ox}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st}} where, m represents the mass, n represents number of moles, suffix st stands for stoichiometric conditions. The advantage of using equivalence ratio over fuel‚Äìoxidizer ratio is that it takes into account (and is therefore independent of) both mass and molar values for the fuel and the oxidizer. Consider, for example, a mixture of one mole of ethane () and one mole of oxygen (). The fuel‚Äìoxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the mass of fuel and air is : \\\\frac{m_\\\\ce{C2H6}}{m_\\\\ce{O2}} = \\\\frac{1 \\\\times (2\\\\times12+6\\\\times1)}{1 \\\\times (2\\\\times16)} = \\\\frac{30}{32} = 0.9375 and the fuel-oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the number of moles of fuel and air is : \\\\frac{n_\\\\ce{C2H6}}{n_\\\\ce{O2}} = \\\\frac{1}{1} = 1 Clearly the two values are not equal. To compare it with the equivalence ratio, we need to determine the fuel‚Äìoxidizer ratio of ethane and oxygen mixture. For this we need to consider the stoichiometric reaction of ethane and oxygen, :C2H6 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 CO2 \\\\+ 3 H2O This gives :(\\\\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on mass})_\\\\text{st} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m_\\\\ce{C2H6}}{m_\\\\ce{O2}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st} = \\\\frac{1 \\\\times (2 \\\\times 12 + 6 \\\\times 1)}{3.5 \\\\times (2 \\\\times 16)} = \\\\frac{30}{112} = 0.268 :(\\\\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on number of moles})_\\\\text{st} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{n_\\\\ce{C2H6}}{n_\\\\ce{O2}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st} = \\\\frac{1}{3.5} = 0.286 Thus we can determine the equivalence ratio of the given mixture as : \\\\phi = \\\\frac{m_\\\\ce{C2H6}/m_\\\\ce{O2}}{\\\\left(m_\\\\ce{C2H6}/m_\\\\ce{O2}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st}} = \\\\frac{0.938}{0.268} = 3.5 or, equivalently, as : \\\\phi = \\\\frac{n_\\\\ce{C2H6}/n_\\\\ce{O2}}{\\\\left(n_\\\\ce{C2H6}/n_\\\\ce{O2}\\\\right)_\\\\text{st}} = \\\\frac{1}{0.286} = 3.5 Another advantage of using the equivalence ratio is that ratios greater than one always mean there is more fuel in the fuel‚Äìoxidizer mixture than required for complete combustion (stoichiometric reaction), irrespective of the fuel and oxidizer being used‚Äîwhile ratios less than one represent a deficiency of fuel or equivalently excess oxidizer in the mixture. This is not the case if one uses fuel‚Äìoxidizer ratio, which take different values for different mixtures. The fuel‚Äìair equivalence ratio is related to the air‚Äìfuel equivalence ratio (defined previously) as follows: :\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} =Mixture fraction= The relative amounts of oxygen enrichment and fuel dilution can be quantified by the mixture fraction, Z, defined as :Z = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{s Y_\\\\mathrm{F} - Y_\\\\mathrm{O} + Y_\\\\mathrm{O,0}}{s Y_\\\\mathrm{F,0} + Y_\\\\mathrm{O,0}} \\\\right], where :s = \\\\mathrm{AFR}_\\\\mathrm{stoich} = \\\\frac{W_\\\\mathrm{O} \\\\times v_\\\\mathrm{O}}{W_\\\\mathrm{F} \\\\times v_\\\\mathrm{F}}, YF,0 and YO,0 represent the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions at the inlet, WF and WO are the species molecular weights, and vF and vO are the fuel and oxygen stoichiometric coefficients, respectively. The stoichiometric mixture fraction is :Z_\\\\mathrm{st} = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\frac{Y_\\\\mathrm{F,0} \\\\times W_\\\\mathrm{O} \\\\times v_\\\\mathrm{O}}{Y_\\\\mathrm{O,0} \\\\times W_\\\\mathrm{F} \\\\times v_\\\\mathrm{F}}} \\\\right ] The stoichiometric mixture fraction is related to Œª (lambda) and œï (phi) by the equations :Z_\\\\text{st} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1+\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\phi}, assuming :\\\\mathrm{AFR} = \\\\frac{Y_\\\\mathrm{O,0}}{Y_\\\\mathrm{F,0}}Introduction to Fuel and Energy: 1) MOLES, MASS, CONCENTRATION AND DEFINITIONS, accessed 2011-05-25 = Percent excess combustion air = Ideal stoichiometryIn industrial fired heaters, power plant steam generators, and large gas-fired turbines, the more common terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air. For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used. A combustion control point can be defined by specifying the percent excess air (or oxygen) in the oxidant, or by specifying the percent oxygen in the combustion product. An air‚Äìfuel ratio meter may be used to measure the percent oxygen in the combustion gas, from which the percent excess oxygen can be calculated from stoichiometry and a mass balance for fuel combustion. For example, for propane () combustion between stoichiometric and 30 percent excess air (AFRmass between 15.58 and 20.3), the relationship between percent excess air and percent oxygen is: :\\\\mathrm{Mass\\\\% \\\\ O_2 \\\\ in \\\\ propane \\\\ combustion \\\\ gas} = -0.1433(\\\\mathrm{\\\\% \\\\ excess \\\\ O_2})^2 + 0.214(\\\\mathrm{\\\\% \\\\ excess \\\\ O_2}) :\\\\mathrm{Volume\\\\% \\\\ O_2 \\\\ in \\\\ propane \\\\ combustion \\\\ gas} = -0.1208(\\\\mathrm{\\\\% \\\\ excess \\\\ O_2})^2 + 0.186(\\\\mathrm{\\\\% \\\\ excess \\\\ O_2}) See alsoAdiabatic flame temperature *AFR sensor *Air‚Äìfuel ratio meter *Mass flow sensor *Combustion *Stoichiometric air-to- fuel ratio of common fuels References  External links  HowStuffWorks: fuel injection, catalytic converter * University of Plymouth: Engine Combustion primer * Chemical reactions Engineering ratios Engine fuel system technology Engines ","title":"Air‚Äìfuel ratio"},{"id":"1846375","text":"National Party (in Spanish: Partido Nacional) was a political party in Peru.

He played professionally as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons with the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets. Tuiasosopo was selected in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Raiders with the 59th overall pick. In 2013, he joined his alma mater, the University of Washington, serving as quarterbacks coach and as interim head coach in the 2013 Fight Hunger Bowl. Tuiasosopo is currently the tight ends coach for the University of California, Berkeley. He was previously the passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach at UCLA. Early years Born in Long Beach, California, Tuiasosopo was raised in Woodinville, a suburb northeast of Seattle. An excellent athlete, he was also a standout shortstop in baseball at Woodinville High School. After his senior year, Tuiasosopo was selected in the 28th round of the 1997 MLB Draft by the Minnesota Twins, but chose to play college football instead. Although he played on both offense & defense in high school (option quarterback & safety), he was primarily recruited by Division I football programs to play defense. Tuiasosopo accepted a football scholarship to the nearby University of Washington in Seattle, primarily because head coach Jim Lambright was one of the few that granted him the opportunity to compete at quarterback, rather than just at safety. College career As a true freshman in 1997, Tuiasosopo rose to second on the depth chart at quarterback. In the season's third week, he was called into action in a nationally televised home game against Nebraska, due to an injury to starter Brock Huard. Despite losing 27-14, Tuiasosopo was impressive against the sixth-ranked (and eventual national champion) Cornhuskers, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns. Later in the year against Oregon, he became the Huskies' first true freshman to start a game at quarterback, throwing for 261 yards and rushing for 95, in a 31-28 loss. He also played considerably the following year for the oft-injured Huard, and was never redshirted. Following his sophomore season in 1998, Rick Neuheisel replaced Lambright as head coach and named Tuiasosopo as the starting quarterback to replace the graduating Huard. As a junior in October 1999, Tuiasosopo became the only player in NCAA college football history to pass for over 300 yards and run for over 200 yards in a game, during a 35-30 victory over the Stanford Cardinal at Husky Stadium. That year, he led the Huskies to a 6-2 conference record, finishing in second place to the Cardinal and earning the team a bid to the Holiday Bowl. As a senior in 2000, he led the Huskies to the Pac-10 title and a 34-24 Rose Bowl victory over Drew Brees and the Purdue Boilermakers, and was named the MVP of the game. The Huskies finished the season with an 11-1 record, ranked third in the national polls. The season included a victory over the Miami Hurricanes at Husky Stadium in September, the Hurricanes' only loss of the season. Tuiasosopo threw for 225 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 45 yards and another touchdown in the 34-29 win, earning national acclaim while finishing eighth in Heisman voting. While at Washington, Tuiasosopo majored in business administration. Professional career =Oakland Raiders= Tuiasosopo was selected by the Raiders in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, the 59th overall pick and the fourth quarterback selected (behind Michael Vick, Drew Brees, and Quincy Carter). In the NFL, Tuiasosopo was primarily a reserve quarterback, the Raiders' backup to Rich Gannon and Kerry Collins. He was on the sidelines for Super Bowl XXXVII at the conclusion of the 2002 season, but did not appear in the game as his team lost 48-21. His first significant playing time came during a Monday Night Football game during the 2003 season, throwing for 224 yards, all in the second half. Marques played well enough to earn his first career NFL start the following week, but struggled, throwing for just 65 yards along with an interception before leaving the game with an injury late in the first half. He did not start another game until late in the 2005 season, where he again struggled losing 26-10. He was promptly demoted back to the sidelines the next week. The team finished just 4-12 in the 2005 season with primarily Collins as the starting quarterback, paving the way for the younger Tuiasosopo to receive more consideration for the job. =New York Jets= Tuiasosopo signed a one- year contract with the New York Jets on March 23, 2007. =Second stint with Raiders= A free agent in the 2008 offseason, Tuiasosopo re-signed with the Raiders on May 22, on a one-year contract in his final NFL season. Post- football career Following his playing career, Tuiasosopo became an assistant strength coach in 2009 at his alma mater, the University of Washington. He moved to UCLA in 2011, on the staff of Neuheisel, his former head coach. He remained with UCLA under new head coach Jim Mora as the tight ends coach in 2012, then returned to the University of Washington in 2013 as quarterbacks coach under fifth-year head coach Steve Sarkisian. Upon Sarkisian's acceptance of the USC head coaching job at the end of the 2013 regular season, Tuiasosopo was named interim head coach for Washington's bowl game. Shortly after leading the Huskies to a win in the 2013 Fight Hunger Bowl Tuiasosopo left Washington to join Sarkisian's staff at USC as tight ends coach and was also given the title of associate head coach. On January 13, 2016, UCLA announced the hiring of Tuiasosopo as quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator. On January 23, 2017, Tuiasosopo was announced as the quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator for the University of California, Berkeley. In 2019, the program realigned the coaching staff and he began working with the tight ends. Personal life Tuiasosopo is the son of former NFL defensive lineman Manu Tuiasosopo, who played collegiately for UCLA, then professionally from 1979 to 1986 for the Seahawks and 49ers, being a starter at nose tackle and winning Super Bowl XIX. Marques' brother is fullback Zach Tuiasosopo, who played for the Philadelphia Eagles until he was waived on July 11, 2007. Zach and Marques were also teammates on the Raiders for part of a season. His youngest brother, Matt, played baseball for the Seattle Mariners, Detroit Tigers and Atlanta Braves. Their sister Leslie, the eldest of the five siblings, played volleyball for Washington, trained with the U.S. national team, and as of 2013 was the Huskies' associate head coach. Marques' younger sister, Ashley, played outfield for the Washington softball team and helped lead the Huskies to a national championship in 2009. His wife Lisa is a former collegiate volleyball player and they have three children.

It was originally called the Radical Party (Partido Radical) by one of its founders Manuel Gonz√°lez Prada. That name seemed too confrontational to many in the party and thus it became known as the National Union. The party grew out of the Literary Circle and morphed into a political party in 1891. One of the central reasons it formed was to create a party of ideas, avoiding the cult of personality that guided the more traditional parties. One of the ideas that guided it was the call for greater European immigration to Peru. Such a stance seems to be a paradox because many of its members defended Peru's Quechua speaking citizens. The only way to understand this paradox is to remember that the National Union was partly founded on the ideals of liberalism and that the Spanish language was the language of commerce.

Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disneyland are the only Magic Kingdom-style Disney parks that do not have the Jungle Cruise in their attraction rosters. The attraction simulates a riverboat cruise down several major rivers of Asia, Africa and South America. Park guests board replica tramp steamers from a 1930s British explorers' lodge and are taken on a voyage past many different Audio-Animatronic jungle animals. The tour is led by a live Disney Cast Member delivering humorous narration. This narration is based on a written and practiced script, but generally is largely delivered ad-lib. Inspiration and design Sources of inspiration for the attraction include a 1955 True-Life Adventure, \\"The African Lion,\\" about a pride of lions, and the film The African Queen. Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the African Queen frequently in his ideas; even his designs of the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film. The project was placed on the schedule to open with the July 17, 1955 debut of Disneyland. When plans began to develop, Bill Evans, the Imagineer responsible for landscaping Disneyland and most of Walt Disney World, faced the daunting task of creating a convincing jungle on a limited budget. Aside from importing many actual tropical plants, he made wide use of \\"character plants\\" which, while not necessarily exotic, could give the appearance of exoticism in context. In a particularly well-known trick, he uprooted local orange trees and \\"replanted\\" them upside-down, growing vines on the exposed roots. Disney controls the clarity of the water (known as \\"turbidity\\") in order to obscure from guests' view the boat's guidance system and undesirable items like perches and mechanized platforms of the bathing elephants and hippos. Initially, the clean water was dyed brown but after a few years the colorant was changed to a green hue and in recent years a bluish-green has been used. The water of the Jungle Cruise is approximately 5 feet deep and is part of the park's 'dark' water system which circulates southward from the northern end of Frontierland's Rivers of America, through Fantasyland and creates the moat of Storybook Land Canal Boats,and Sleeping Beauty Castle. The water's journey continues flowing past Frontierland's entrance and into Adventureland where it meanders alongside the Tiki Room before entering the Jungle Cruise beside the ride's exit. The water returns to the south end of the Rivers of America via a 37\\" diameter underground pipe near Tarzan's Treehouse. Originally, the Jungle Cruise waterway was 1,920 feet in length before being slightly shortened and re-routed in 1994. Although Goff and Evans can be credited with the creation and initial design of the ride, Marc Davis, recognized for his work on venerable attractions such as The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, added his own style to the ride in later versions and Disneyland updates. The \\"Indian Elephant Bathing Pool\\" and \\"Rhinoceros Chasing Explorers up a Pole\\" were among his contributions.Minnick, Nathaniel. The Jungle Cruise: Foray into the Faux, (University of Michigan, 2005) Disneyland The attraction was in the opening day roster of the park, and has remained open and largely unchanged in theme and story since then. The original plan was to use real animals, but these plans were abandoned once Disney realized that the animals would likely sleep during the day. Aside from alterations and maintenance changes, four completely new show scenes have been added to date. In 1994 the river channel was rerouted to make way for the queue buildings and entrance courtyard of the Indiana Jones Adventure. While the current version and most previous instances have made use of a comedic spiel, filled with intentionally bad puns, the original intent of the ride was to provide a realistic, believable voyage through the world's jungles. Until 1962, the original spiel had no jokes and sounded much like the narration of a nature documentary. =Attraction summary= The queue and station are themed as the headquarters and boathouse of the Jungle Navigation Company, a river trading company located in a British colony (as evidenced by the Union Jack flying above the boathouse) circa 1938. The queuing area is cluttered with appropriate props, such as pinned insects, an old radio on top of a bookshelf, an old typewriter, and a chessboard with miniature animals and decorated shotgun shells replacing the pieces. The extended queue winds upstairs, underneath an Audio-Animatronic great hornbill, and then downstairs again. Big band music from the 1930s and 1940s plays overhead, punctuated by jungle-related news bulletins, helping to reinforce the setting and threading together the show scenes and boat. Once aboard the boats, guests are introduced to their skipper and they head into the jungle, allegedly never to return. The first rivers simulated are the Irrawaddy and Mekong rivers, representing tropical Southeast Asia. The boats sail through a dense rainforest inhabited by large butterflies and a pair of toucans, before passing by the Temple of the Forbidden Eye and a shrine to the Hindu monkey deity Hanuman. Passengers then glide precariously under the first of a pair of stone arches severely damaged by an earthquake centuries ago. These are part of the ruins of an ancient Cambodian city where a crumbling temple is one of the few things which have managed to avoid tumbling into the river. Here passengers see an Indo-Chinese tiger, giant spiders, king cobras and mugger crocodiles. Passing a statue of the elephant-headed Hindu deity Ganesha, the boats pass under the second arch and enter the Sacred Indian Elephant Bathing Pool. Here a large herd of Indian elephants frolic and squirt water at the passing vessels. The theme moves to the rivers of Africa, and riders see a family of baboons, and a safari camp that has been overrun by gorillas. The boats narrowly avoid the dramatic waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls), and turn down Africa's Nile river where they pass between two African elephants, and large termite mounds. A tableau of the African Veldt follows, showing zebras, wildebeest, giraffes, and gazelles watching a pride of lions feasting on a zebra beneath a rocky outcropping. Beyond the lion's den, an angry rhinoceros has chased a safari party up a tree. Antelope and hyenas watch from nearby. The skipper then pilots the boat into the Congo river disturbing a pod of hippos that signal their intent to attack the boat. Drums and chanting are heard as the boats come to headhunter territory. The vehicles pass a native village before sailing into an ambush by natives wielding spears, the sound effects for which are usually provided by the skipper. The boats now pass behind Schweitzer Falls (referred to as \\"the Backside of Water\\") to enter the Amazon River. Skeletal animal remains and warning signs featuring pictures of dagger-toothed fish forewarn the next show scene, where the boats encounter a swarm of leaping piranha. The guests then pass a couple of water buffalo and a boa constrictor before they meet shrunken head dealer Trader Sam (\\"He'll trade you two of his heads for just one of yours\\") before returning to the dock. =Major changes= 1957 - Addition of rainforest, pair of menacing gorillas, native war party and dancing natives. Trader Sam begins offering his \\"... two for one deal.\\" * 1961 - Original two-story boathouse removed; open waterway between Jungle Cruise and Rivers of America filled in to create space for the Swiss Family Treehouse walk-through attraction (now Tarzan's Treehouse.) * 1962 - A $7 million enhancement of Adventureland includes the addition of the Indian elephant pool and temple of Ganesha/lost city/Cambodian ruins scenes along the Jungle Cruise. * 1963 - African elephants re-positioned on the Nile river section; removal of two original lions and pair of 'charging' rhinos. * 1964 - African Veldt and Trapped Safari scenes. * 1976 - Addition and enhancement of several scenes: crocodiles snapping at hornbill, Indo-Chinese tiger and cobras added to Cambodian ruins, safari camp overrun by gorillas, gorilla battling crocodile, baboons on termite mounds, lions feasting on zebra moved into new rock outcropping/den, python threatening water buffalo calf replacing gorillas threatening from the river banks. * 1993 - Boats repainted and \\"weathered\\" in anticipation of Indiana Jones Adventure * 1994 - Addition of new two-story boathouse queue; attraction re-themed to take place in June 1938 to coincide with the construction of Indiana Jones Adventure. * 1997 - Replacement of the original ride boats with slightly longer models with increased capacity. * 2001 - Skippers were disarmed of their pistols and no longer fired shots during the ride. * 2005 - Various replacements and reconstructions including complete replacement of Schweitzer Falls; addition of piranhas; updates to safari jeep camp scene including 'exploding' gasoline drums * 2010 - After 55 years of growth and care, Disneyland's man-made jungle is declared \\"real\\" and complete with its own self-sustaining ecosystem. * 2013 - During the Holiday season, the Jungle Cruise turned into the \\"Jingle Cruise,\\" a new Christmas overlay. This did not see many changes to the jungle itself (other than the skippers using a holiday-themed script), but the boathouse was decorated and the boats were renamed temporarily and covered in Christmas lights. * 2014 - The holiday \\"Jingle Cruise\\" overlay is redone and is a dramatic departure from the previous year. This time, there is very little decoration on the boats and in the boathouse itself, but instead the various show scenes out in the jungle are covered in Christmas and Hanukkah decorations. The skippers are given another new script, one that reflects the various holiday-themed show scenes the boat sails through. The Jingle Cruise is also given a new story: A shipment of holiday supplies intended for the skippers crash-landed in the jungle instead, and the skippers are taking their passengers out to go find the decorations. The boats are also given new holiday names, different from the ones used the year before. * 2015 - The \\"Jingle Cruise\\" overlay from 2014 was reused for the 2015 holiday season, using the 2014 script, boat names, and show scenes. There was one new scene added, involving giant snowmen and snowflakes on the termite mounds by the African Veldt. * 2016 - A four-month refurbishment lasting from January until May included a new dock designed to stabilize the boats while loading and unloading, as well as some mechanical animal repairs, replacement of the on-ride audio systems, and tree replacement. Description of specific changes: The baboons at the safari jeep camp previously sat on the African termite mounds. A total of six lions have been removed since opening day: one that growled when the African Veldt was added, two lionesses from the Veldt that were fighting over a bloody strand of zebra meat, a lion and a lioness that each had a zebra leg in their mouth, and a dead lion hanging on a spit over a fire in the native village. Also removed from the Veldt were jackals barking at the pride. =Boats= There are 12 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time. The boats in 1955 were painted as clean, idealized replicas, but have since been given a more realistic theming reflecting the grunge and wear of actual watercraft due to the addition of Indiana Jones Adventure and its ruggedness. Names in use: *Amazon Belle (Renamed \\"Jingle Belle\\" during Christmas) *Congo Queen (Renamed \\"Congo Caroler\\" then \\"Candy Cane Queen\\" during Christmas) *Ganges Gal (Renamed \\"Ganges Garland\\" then \\"Gingerbread Gal\\" during Christmas) *Hondo Hattie (Renamed \\"Hondo Hollie\\" then \\"Hanukkah Hattie\\" during Christmas) *Irrawaddy Woman (Renamed \\"Irrawaddy Snowwoman\\" during Christmas) *Kissimmee Kate (Renamed \\"Yule Kissimmee\\" then \\"Kissimmee Under the Mistetoe\\" during Christmas) *Nile Princess (Wheelchair equipped) (Renamed \\"Nile Nutcracker\\" then \\"Noel Princess\\" during Christmas) *Orinoco Adventuress (Renamed \\"Orinoco Ornament\\" then \\"Navidad Adventuress\\" during Christmas) *Suwannee Lady (Renamed \\"Suwannee Sleigh\\" then \\"Sugar Plum Lady\\" during Christmas) *Ucayali Una (Wheelchair equipped) (Renamed \\"Ucayali Eggnog\\" then \\"Evergreen Una\\" during Christmas) *Yangtze Lotus (Renamed \\"Yuletide Lotus\\" during Christmas) *Zambezi Miss (Renamed \\"Peppermint Miss\\" during Christmas) Names decommissioned in 1997: *Magdalena Maiden *Mekong Maiden Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland Jungle Cruise at Tokyo Disneyland =Attraction summary= The skipper introduces themself, and begins to take the boat full of guests down the tropical rivers of the world. The ride starts out in the Amazon River, where the passengers encounter butterflies with one-foot wingspans, or as the skipper might say, twelve inches. The boat then passes Inspiration Falls, which transitions into the Congo River in Africa. The skipper explains that there is a pygmy welcoming party waiting for them, but when the boat arrives at the beach, the canoes are empty, and the place deserted. The skipper wonders what scared off the pygmies, and they soon discover that it was a giant python. The boat then passes a camp that has been raided by gorillas, which transitions the cruise into the Nile River. After encountering two elephants, the boat passes along the African Veldt, where numerous African animals watch a pride of lions eat their kill. The boat then passes a lost safari group that has been chased up a pole by an angry rhinoceros and are now trapped. The group then passes by another waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls) and heads past the remains of a plane crash. The boat then encounters a pool of hippos, about to charge the boat until the skipper scares them off. Ominous drums are heard as the group enters headhunter territory. Natives are seen dancing near the boat and guests soon find themselves in an ambush. They escape and proceed into the Mekong River. They enter a temple which has been destroyed by an earthquake. Inside, baboons, cobras, giant spiders and a tiger can be found. After they exit, they come across an elephant bathing pool where numerous elephants are relaxing in the water. The boat narrowly avoids being sprayed by water from one of the elephants. The cruise concludes after passing Chief Nami or Trader Sam (Trader Sam-Ta during Christmas), the head salesman of the jungle, who offers two shrunken heads for one of the passengers'. =Magic Kingdom= The Walt Disney World Jungle Cruise is set as a depression-era British outpost on the Amazon River, operated by the fictional company, The Jungle Navigation Co., whose advertisement poster is painted on the wall near the exit of the attraction. Albert Awol's broadcast is different from that of Disneyland's, being ride specific. Also unlike Disneyland, the queue never extended to a second level. Near the Hippo Pool, a piece of a downed airplane can be seen along the shoreline. This is the back half of the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior previously found at The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Casablanca scene. Each variety of plant throughout the attraction was carefully selected by landscape architect Bill Evans to ensure that the foliage would be able to endure Florida's unique climate: hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most difficult aspect of this was making sure these plants had the appropriate look and feel of traditional tropical plants in the equatorial jungle. A Holiday overlay, Jingle Cruise, runs during the Holiday season at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. This started in the Holiday season of 2013. A Jungle Cruise themed restaurant, the Skipper Canteen, opened in December 2015 and expanded on the Jungle Navigation Co. storyline, making Dr. Albert Falls into the founder of the company in 1911, with his granddaughter Alberta Falls taking charge of the Navigation Company and the Jungle Cruise in the 1930s. Queue The queue of the Jungle Cruise is heavily themed with period artifacts, tools, gear, photos and more. It is intended to resemble a colonial outpost where an exploration of the jungle rivers may be booked. It is divided into four main sections which may be opened or closed in sequence to accommodate crowd fluctuation. The queue was designed to wind about extensively so that guests may see all of the different artifacts in the queue. The most notable section of the queue is the office of Albert Awol. Boats There are 15 vehicles, with a maximum of 9 in operation at any given time. The Sankuru Sadie is one of two boats in the Magic Kingdom's fleet to have ever sunk. * Amazon Annie (Renamed \\"Eggnog Annie\\" during Christmas) * Bomokandi Bertha (Wheelchair lift equipped) (Renamed \\"Brrrrr Bertha\\" during Christmas) * Congo Connie (Renamed \\"Candy Cane Connie\\" during Christmas) * Ganges Gertie (Renamed \\"Garland Gertie\\" during Christmas) * Irrawaddy Irma (Renamed \\"Icicle Irma\\" during Christmas) * Mongala Millie (Renamed \\"Mistletoe Millie\\" during Christmas) * Nile Nellie (Renamed \\"Noel Nellie\\" during Christmas) * Orinoco Ida (Renamed \\"Orino-cocoa Ida\\" during Christmas) * Rutshuru Ruby (Renamed \\"Reindeer Ruby\\" during Christmas) * Sankuru Sadie (Renamed \\"Sleigh Ride Sadie\\" during Christmas) * Senegal Sal (Renamed \\"Poinsettia Sal\\" during Christmas) * Ucyali Lolly (Renamed \\"Yule Log Lolly\\" during Christmas) * Volta Val (Renamed \\"Vixen Val\\" during Christmas) * Wamba Wanda (Wheelchair lift equipped) (Renamed \\"Wassail Wanda\\" during Christmas) * Zambezi Zelda (Renamed \\"Fruitcake Zelda\\" during Christmas) Retired boats * Kwango Kate (Retired in 2000) =Tokyo Disneyland= The Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland attractions are very similar to each other, with the exception of a few minor differences. While the boats in the Magic Kingdom's attraction travel counter-clockwise, the boats at Tokyo Disneyland travel in a clockwise direction. In Tokyo Disneyland, the station and surrounding area are themed to a more upscale African city, as opposed to an isolated jungle outpost. This version shares a station building with the park's steam train ride, Western River Railroad. The spiels in Tokyo Disneyland are delivered in Japanese. In 2015, the ride was refurbished to include special effects. Boats There are 13 vehicles, with a maximum of 12 in operation at any given time. All boat names, except Orinoco Ida, are alliterations. Jungle Cruise in Tokyo Disneyland shares a station complex with the Western River Railroad. * Amazon Annie * Congo Connie * Ganges Gertie * Irrawaddy Irma * Kwango Kate * Nile Nelly * Orinoco Ida * Rutshuru Ruby * Sankuru Sadie * Senegal Sal * Volta Val * Wamba Wanda * Zambezi Zelda =Retired boats= Bomokandi Bertha (Retired in 2020) Disneyland Paris Disneyland Paris does not have any Jungle Cruise attraction, due to the cold temperature and weather of northern France. Because many copies of the original Jungle Cruise attractions exist in other French theme parks, French guests might be used to the experience and not find it exciting. An indoor jeep ride called Jungle Expedition was originally planned at the opening of the park, but was cancelled due to financial difficulties. Hong Kong Disneyland Jungle River Cruise at Hong Kong Disneyland fire god sets and a water bomb The shape of Hong Kong Disneyland's route is significantly different compared to the others, and circumnavigates Tarzan's Treehouse. A grand finale is included with a battle between angry fire and water gods. Three languages are regularly available: Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Each language has a separate queue, allowing visitors to experience the journey in their preferred language. =Attraction summary= The queue takes place in a small boathouse of The Jungle Navigation Co. that is less elaborate than the boathouses found at the other parks. After winding through the queue, guests board one of the boats and meet their skipper who speaks either English, Cantonese, or Mandarin, to accompany the park's guests who speak many different languages themselves. The boats then depart and head down the river, past Tarzan's Treehouse where the skipper tells guests to wave goodbye to the guests traversing the treehouse, for they will never see them again. The boats then drift past an Indian elephant and her calf playing in the water, followed by another elephant showering in a waterfall. A large bull Indian elephant emerges from the water squirting a plume of water at the boats with the guests narrowly avoiding the free shower. The vessels then drift down a narrow stream past ancient Cambodian ruins which have been claimed by the jungle. Giant spiders and king cobras watch the boats as they move on. Up ahead several crocodiles are seen resting on a small beach, while a school of hungry piranha are jumping in the hopes of attacking the guests. The boats escape into Africa and they pass a large safari camp where several curious gorillas have discovered clothes, guns, hammocks, and books, as the \\"Trashing the Camp\\" song from Tarzan plays on a nearby 1930s radio. The African Veldt comes into view where antelope, giraffes, zebras, and African elephants stare at the boats. The vessels then drift into a small pool where a pod of hippos try to tip the boat. Several feet ahead a rhino is seen chasing a safari group up a tree while several hyenas look on laughing. Skulls and cloth impaled on broken bamboo sticks appears as tribal drums and horns fill the air. The skipper tells guests that they have entered head hunter country and must quietly sneak by. The boats slowly pass through the main village where several upright shields rest in the tall grass. A native notices the boats and all the shields now revealed to have head hunters behind them begin firing spears and poison darts at the boats as they narrowly escape into a rocky canyon. In the rocky canyon, the boats stop near two unusual rock formations that look like faces, revealed by the skipper to be the fire god and the water god who constantly feud over their differences. The fire god sets the river ablaze while the water god vomits a water bomb, causing the flames to die and the whole canyon to become a cloud of steam. The boats escape the canyon and pass a baby elephant before returning to the boathouse. Major changes 2006 - Piranha Attack and Trapped Safari scenes added, enhancement of Gorilla Camp, African Veldt, and Headhunter Territory * 2007 - Temporary scenes added during the \\"Pirate Takeover\\" summer event (from May to August); attraction name changed to \\"Jungle River Cruise, Pirate Takeover!\\" * 2015 - Temporary scenes added during Halloween event; attraction name changed to \\"Jungle River Cruise - Curse of the Emerald Trinity\\" Boats There are 9 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time. * Amazon Annie * Congo Queen (Wheelchair accessible) * Ganges Gal (Wheelchair accessible) * Irrawaddy Irma * Lijiang Lady * Mekong Maiden * Nile Nellie * Yangzi Ying Ying * Zambezi Zelda Albert Awol Albert Awol is a fictional Jungle Cruise boat captain and disc jockey for the Disney Broadcasting Company. Considered the \\"Voice of the Jungle\\", he broadcasts everything from news, to quizzes, reminders, weather, etc. on the DBC (Disney Broadcast Company). He also serves as a period disc jockey for the station, filling the airwaves with music from the 1930s Depression era. Albert Awol was added in 1991 to the Jungle Cruise during a refurbishment. According to one report: Albert's broadcast is projected not just over the Jungle Cruise queuing area, but over Adventureland as a whole, setting the time period. In Disneyland, Albert is replaced by \\"Jungle Radio.\\" Various air personalities comment on the environment, the luminaries who are in the area (including references to the designers of the attraction - Harper Goff, Bob Mattey, Winston Hibler [True- Life Adventure films, upon which Jungle Cruise is based]). The music is a good deal slower in pace and tempo than the tracks used at Walt Disney World. The music was previously linked with the outdoor speakers at the Temple of the Forbidden Eye (Indiana Jones Adventure), however, two separate tracks of material with similar tone and some songs now exist. The Jungle Radio at Disneyland does connect the setting with the nearby Indiana Jones attraction, and ties in announcements that reference Indiana Jones, and the temple in which the ride is set.b Minnick, Nathaniel. \\"Disney's Lands in the History of Colonial Displays of the Exotic\\" (University of Michigan, 2006) Jingle Cruise Since 2013, a Christmas overlay called Jingle Cruise has run during the holiday season in the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland versions of the Jungle Cruise except for 2017 at Disneyland in which the overlay was not installed. Redesign In April 2017, it was reported that the ride will undergo extensive planning to change the ride. The updated re-engineering and redesign has extended to the future-star of the film adaptation Dwayne Johnson, and his film production company. Johnson is working with Disney to implement the changes for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts locations worldwide. In popular cultureThere was a tribute to the ride in 2005 on an episode of the podcast The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd, as well as a Strong Bad E-mail titled \\"theme park\\". *In the sing along songs video Disneyland Fun during \\"Following the Leader\\", Jungle Cruise made an appearance. *Jungle Cruise was parodied as Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari on The Lion King Special Edition (as their Nighttime Safari Boat Tour). *A stand-up comedy show featuring only Jungle Cruise skippers, called The Skipper Stand Up Show, has been doing shows in Fullerton, California since May 2006. *\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic wrote and recorded a song titled \\"Skipper Dan\\" about a failed actor who ended up as a guide on the Jungle Cruise. The song is included on his 2009 digital Internet Leaks EP and his 2011 album, Alpocalypse. *The cruise boat and the \\"River Expedition Company\\" boathouse were incorporated into an original painting and limited edition print offering by artist Randy Souders titled \\"Jungle Cruise\\", created for the 1999 Official Disneyana Convention at Disneyland. =Soundtrack= A studio recorded soundtrack of the Jungle Cruise was released in 1968 by Disneyland Records included as the B side of the album Walt Disney Presents The Enchanted Tiki Room and the Adventurous Jungle Cruise (ST-3966). The Jungle Cruise attraction has always featured narration by a live Disney Cast Member; for the release the narration was provided by Thurl Ravenscroft. This soundtrack was also used in Disneyland television features as early as 1964. =Film adaptation= For years, Walt Disney Pictures had been toying with the idea of turning the Jungle Cruise into a full-length action adventure motion picture, which it would be loosely inspired by the theme park attraction of the same name. The film, originally scheduled for release in 2007, experienced various delays and changes. Shooting of the film, originally scheduled for 2006, was postponed. Moreover, the original screenplay by Josh Goldstein and John Norville was reportedly rewritten by Al Gough and Miles Millar. The film plot follows a group's riverboat journey through a jungle in search of a cure. Though initially announced to star Toy Story duo Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, a new iteration of the project is moving forward with Dwayne Johnson starring. The film is described as a \\"period piece in the vein of Humphrey Bogart's The African Queen.\\" Later, Johnson signed on as a producer in addition to his starring role, and the film was to start filming in spring 2018. The film's release was delayed first from 2019 to 2020, and then again to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has three parishes, two urban parishes, one called La Puntilla and the other called Town of Samborond√≥n (Cabecera cantonal). There's another rural parish called Tarifa. La Puntilla's parish is one of the most exclusive residential and entertainment districts in Ecuador, boasting many Gated Communities (urbanizaciones cerradas) and several retail developments are located in the suburb. Its proximity to the country's second-largest city, Guayaquil (merely crossing a bridge), allows many of its residents to work there. Most of the upper-class families in Guayaquil live at La Puntilla's Parish in Samborond√≥n. Samborond√≥n was founded on May 24, 1776 and achieve its independence on October 10, 1820. Since October 31, 1955 the suburb has been a canton. The canton has 105 localities and two urban parishes (La Puntilla) and Samborond√≥n Town (Cabecera cantonal) and one rural parish (Tarifa).History The name Samborond√≥n comes from Saint Brendan, in Spanish San Borond√≥n. The name of the Saint was commonly used in Spain and subsequently in Latin America for towns and villages. The name Samborond√≥n, in general usage, often refers to the rich downtown area of the canton called La Puntilla. In fact, Samborond√≥n consists of a much larger area than just La Puntilla, which is a peninsula between the rivers Babahoyo and Daule (where the River Guayas is formed). La Puntilla is known as the home of many of the rich and powerful of Guayaquil, including banana tycoon and several-time presidential candidate √Ålvaro Noboa, Ecuador's richest man. But much the canton is in fact rural and poor, and most of its inhabitants live from the cultivation of rice. Nevertheless, the mayor (who himself lives in Guayaquil) has done a lot to improve their situation and his policies are intended to benefit poorer inhabitants of the canton, as well as the richer inhabitants.Two examples from the newspaper El Universo: Mayor promises mending in 8 days and Plan for pedestrian bridge Several improvements have been made to the area recently. Health care A new branch of the Kennedy Hospital, a local private hospital chain, was finished in 2007 and is now in use.El Universo There are also a few building complexes specially built for medical practices. Shopping and entertainment The local shopping center, Riocentro Entrerios has many retail stores, a hypermarket, a food court, and a cinema. The Village Plaza was inaugurated in August 2010. A hypermarket from the Supermaxi chain and other 90 stores have been announced. Bocca, La Piazza, La Torre, Las Terrazas, Plaza Lagos, Piazza Villa Club and Plaza Navona are smaller shopping centers, mainly around exclusive restaurants, gyms, night clubs and stores. Tierra Diversi√≥n is an amusement park for children aged 2‚Äì10 and has a capacity of 100 children. They specialize in children's birthday parties and business events for children. Riverpark is an open-air amusement park for children and young people set with a castle theme. Tourism The Parque Hist√≥rico, a botanical garden and zoo of the local fauna and flora with reconstructions of historical buildings, is one of the main tourist attractions of Guayaquil.El Universo Samborond√≥n has a hotel boutique, Orilla del Rio, located in Entrerios. Its close proximity to Guayaquil (5 minutes by car, pedestrian access prohibited on the bridge) makes this unproblematic for the visitor, except on peak hours (7‚Äì8 a.m. and 4‚Äì7 p.m.) Samborond√≥n is also home to the most exclusive night clubs in Greater Guayaquil and also there are three restaurants-complex with luxurious and innovative cuisine, that otherwise are not found in the city. Education Due to the increasing growth of the area, many schools have relocated or established branch campuses from Guayaquil and Quito to Samborond√≥n. Most of them are exclusive private schools, among them Colegio Menor, Abd√≥n Calder√≥n, Torremar and Delta (belonging to Opus Dei), Nuevo Mundo, Liceo Panamericano, Moderna Sergio P√©rez Valdez, Centro Educativo Naciones Unidas, La Moderna, CREAR and Monte Tabor. The German School Guayaquil inaugurated a second Kindergarten in Samborond√≥n on April 13, 2009. There are 23 public elementary schools in the Canton.Public schools in Samborond√≥n The first university located in the suburb was the Universidad de Especialidades Esp√≠ritu Santo, which opened its doors on 1994.

The company is a distributor of fuel additives. Among other products, Ethyl Corporation distributes tetraethyllead, an additive used to make leaded gasoline. History Founded in 1923, Ethyl Corp was formed by General Motors and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso). General Motors had the \\"use patent\\" for tetraethyllead (TEL) as an antiknock, based on the work of Thomas Midgley, Jr., Charles Kettering, and later Charles Allen Thomas,Ralph Landau, \\"Charles Allen Thomas,\\" Memorial Tributes, vol. 2, National Academy of Engineering and Esso had the patent for the manufacture of TEL. Since the patents affected the marketing of TEL, General Motors and ESSO formed Ethyl Corp; each parent company had a 50% stake in the new corporation. Since neither company had chemical plant experience, they hired Dupont to operate the manufacturing facilities. After patents ran out, Dupont started manufacture of TEL on their own, and Ethyl started running its own operations. Within the first year of its operation, the company‚Äôs plants were plagued by cases of lead poisoning, hallucinations, insanity, and even the deaths of its employees due to exposure to lead. While the company tried to hush the news, at times it was impossible, for example in 1924 when five production workers died and 35 more turned into staggering wrecks at one ill-ventilated facility. To counter these accusations, Thomas Midgley, Jr. participated in a press conference to demonstrate the apparent safety of TEL on October 30, 1924, in which he poured TEL over his hands, placed a bottle of the chemical under his nose, and inhaled its vapor for 60 seconds, declaring that he could do this every day without succumbing to any problems. In fact, he knew the dangers of lead poisoning, having been made seriously ill from over exposure a few months earlier. The State of New Jersey ordered the Baywater plant to be closed a few days later, and Jersey Standard was forbidden to manufacture TEL again without state permission. In 1962, Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, in Richmond, borrowed $200 million and purchased Ethyl Corporation (Delaware), a corporation 13 times its size. Albemarle then changed its name to Ethyl Corporation. It is believed that General Motors thought to divest itself of \\"Ethyl Corporation,\\" owing to concern about liabilities of TEL. The 1962 transaction was the largest leveraged buyout until that time. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Ethyl Corporation expanded and diversified in response to the gradual decline of the market for TEL, as the automotive industry shifted to unleaded gasoline due to the US' Clean Air Act of 1970 and when leaded patrol became in the US in 1986. In the late 1980s, Ethyl began to spin off a number of divisions. The aluminum, plastics, and energy units became Tredegar Corporation in 1989. In 1993, it spun off its life insurance company, First Colony Life, and then in 1994, the specialty chemicals business was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation. In 2004, Ethyl Corporation became a subsidiary of NewMarket Corporation (). Tetraethyllead Tetraethyllead has been recognized as a contributor to soil, air and water lead pollution, and is toxic to humans. While leaded gasoline made engines more efficient, lead pollution has increased by over 625 times previous levels in the past century due partly to pollution by leaded fuel. Ethyl Corporation historically denied that tetraethyllead poses significant public health risks in excess of those associated with gasoline itself. Tetraethyllead was supplied for blending with raw gasoline in the form of \\"Ethyl Fluid\\", which blended tetraethyllead with the lead scavengers 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. Ethyl fluid contained a dye which would distinguish treated gasoline from untreated gasoline and discourage the diversion of gasoline for other purposes, such as cleaning.

He was the eldest son of Sir James Audley of Stratton Audley in Oxfordshire. Biography When the order of the Garter was founded, he was initiated as one of its first members and his stall in St. George's Chapel, Windsor was the eleventh on the side of Edward, the Black Prince. He served in France in 1346, where, at Crecy, he fought in the rearguard under Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. In August 1350 he took part in the naval Battle of Winchelsea. When hostilities were renewed between England and France in 1354 Sir James was in constant attendance upon the Black Prince, and earned a great reputation for valour. At the Battle of Poitiers on September 19, 1356 he took his stand in front of the English army, and after fighting for a long time was severely wounded and carried from the fight. After the victory, the prince inquired after Sir James, who was brought to the royal tent, where Edward told him he had been the bravest knight on his side, and granted him an annuity of five hundred marks. Sir James made over this gift to the four esquires who had attended him during the battle, and received from the prince a further pension of six hundred marks. A variation of this story states that, after commending highly his four esquires, and attributing his success mainly to their enterprising spirit, made over to them the donation of five hundred marks. This act of generosity coming to the ear of the prince Edward, and, approving what he had done, confirmed the grant to the esquires, assigning to sir James an annual rent of six hundred marks.Froissart, iii. p. 197. In 1359 he was one of the leaders of an expedition into France. In 1360 he took the fortress of Chaven in Brittany, as well as the castle of Ferte-sous-Jouarre, and was present at Calais when peace was made between England and France in October 1360. He was afterwards governor of Aquitaine and great seneschal of Poitou, and took part in the capture of the town of La Roche-sur-Yon by Edmund, earl of Cambridge. He died in 1369 at Fontenay-le-Comte, where he had gone to reside, and was buried at Poitiers.Michael Jones, ‚ÄòAudley, Sir James (c.1318‚Äì1369)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 accessed 1 March 2009 Arms \\"Gules fretty Or\\" Henry de Aldithley (or Audley), 1st in the line of Lord Audeley who died in 1246, had a seal with a fretty shield and his descendants bore a shield described as 'gules fretty or'.

The spine injury is characterized by a shooting or stinging pain that travels down one arm, followed by numbness and weakness in the parts of the arms, including the biceps, deltoid, and spinati muscles. Many athletes in contact sports have suffered stingers, but they are often unreported to medical professionals. Anyone who experiences significant trauma to his or her head or neck needs immediate medical evaluation for the possibility of a spinal injury. In fact, it's safest to assume that trauma victims have a spinal injury until proven otherwise because: * The time between injury and treatment can be critical in determining the extent of complications and the amount of recovery * A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. If it is not recognized, more severe injury may occur * Numbness or paralysis may develop immediately or come on gradually as bleeding or swelling occurs in or around the spinal cord  Mechanism  The three main mechanisms of a stinger include receiving direct blows, extension, and compression of the brachial plexus, with most of the brachial plexus injuries being an extension-compression mechanism. A stinger is an injury that is caused by restriction of the nerve supply to the upper extremity via the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior rami of the nerves at the 5th cervical level of the spinal cord all the way to the nerves at the 1st thoracic level of the spinal cord. The brachial plexus innervates the upper extremity as well as some muscles in the neck and shoulder.Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. 6th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2012. Print. Damage to the brachial plexus can occur when the nerves are stretched too far from the head and neck; specifically the upper trunk of the plexus ‚Äìnerve roots at the 5th and 6th cervical level ‚Äìare primarily affected. The upper trunk provides part of the nerve to supply to the upper extremity via the Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial and Median nerves.PM&R; Knowledge. \\"AAPM&R;  American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\\" PM&R; Knowledge NOW. American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 2012. It is for this reason that stingers do not affect both arms simultaneously, however it is possible for both arms to accrue injuries. Repeated nerve trauma can cause recurring stingers, chronic pain, and muscle weakness, while recovery can take weeks to months in severe cases. Since stingers are a nerve injury, a stinger can fall into two different categories of peripheral nerve injury with physiological differences. Grade I is neurapraxia, which involves focal damage of the myelin fibers around the axon, with the axon and the connective tissue sheath remaining intact. The disruption of nerve function involves demyelination. Axonal integrity is preserved, and remyelination occurs within days or weeks.Neal, S. L., & Fields, K. B. (2010). Peripheral Nerve Entrapment and Injury in the Upper Extremity. American Family Physician , 81(2), 147‚Äì155. Retrieved from https://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0115/p147.htmlKuhlman , G. S., & Mckeag , D. B. (1999). The ‚ÄúBurner‚Äù: A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports. American Family Physician , 2035‚Äì2040. Retrieved from https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html Grade II is categorized by axonotmesis which is the most severe case of nerve injury in the context of stingers and involves the injury of the axon. Grade III is classified as neurotmesis where there is a complete disruption of the axon, where it is unlikely of recovery. If this is to happen it is not considered a stinger, and usually is a high-energy injury to the shoulder-girdle.  Diagnosis and treatment  Stingers are best diagnosed by a medical professional. This person will assess the athlete's pain, range of head and neck motion, arm numbness, and muscle strength. Often, the affected athlete is allowed to return to play within a short time, but persistent symptoms will result in removal. Athletes are also advised to receive regular evaluations until symptoms have ceased, specifically, the restoration of pain-free mobility. If they have not after two weeks, or increase, additional tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to detect a more serious injury, such as a herniated disc. The order of treatments applied depends on whether the athlete's main complaint is pain or weakness. Both can be treated with an analgesic, anti-inflammatory medication, ice and heat, restriction of movement, and if necessary, cervical collar or traction. Surgery is only necessary in the most severe cases.  Returning to play  Returning from this injury depends on the number of burners that occurs. If a stinger occurs, the athletes usually return to play after they restore full strength, are asymptomatic where no pain persists, and painless range of motion in the cervical spine. At low frequencies of stingers, like 1 or 2, there is a much lower risk of the symptoms reoccurring. If three or more stingers occur in one season, one has a higher increased risk at the symptoms persisting. If one is returning from play to contact sports it is important to adopt a strict exercise regimen of the neck muscles so the player has the ability to handle the trauma associated with tackles.  Prevention  Stingers can be prevented by several of the following factors, but first, it is crucial to identify the severity of the stinger because treatment usually depends on that factor. If strengthening treatment starts too early with a severe case, it can prevent one from healing. The dysfunctions that caused the peripheral nerve injury must be identified to treat and prevent future injury. Flexibility and strength of the neck, shoulder, and upper extremity are essential because stiffness and weakness are predisposing factors for a burner as well as consequences of this injury. Factors that could help in the prevention of stingers could include strengthening the muscles, increasing the range of motion, and improving technique when playing.KUHLMAN, GEOFFREY S, and DOUGLAS B MCKEAG. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòBurner‚Äô: A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports.‚Äù American Family Physician, 1 Nov. 1999, https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html. Simple measures can be taken to help in the recovery from stingers. A chest- out posture should be adapted to prevent the neck from extending too far because it brings the head over the shoulders. The chest-out posture is emphasized due to it not being commonly adopted by athletes due to developed shoulders and is perpetuated by brachial plexus irritation. The chest-out posture also reduces pressure on the brachial plexus by opening the thoracic outlet. Finally, stingers can be prevented by wearing protective gear, such as butterfly restrictors, designed to protect the head and neck from being forced into unnatural positions. This equipment is more feasible in positions where unrestricted head and neck movement is not required, such as American football lineman, than in positions like quarterback, where such movement is integral. Regardless of equipment, it is important to report even minor symptoms to an athletic trainer or team physician, and to allow appropriate recovery time.  Epidemiology  Stingers commonly occur in contact sports like wrestling, hockey, basketball, boxing, rugby, weightlifting, and, most notably, football. One study found that up to 65% of college football players have suffered at least one stinger. However, it is difficult to ping an exact number of athletes that suffer from stingers as stingers are historically under- reported. This could be due to the players fear of being removed from play or the injury being viewed as unimportant.Weinberg , J., Rokito , S., & Silber , J. S. (2003). Etiology, treatment, and prevention of athletic ‚Äò‚Äòstingers.‚Äô‚Äô CLINICS IN SPORTS MEDICINE , 493‚Äì500. Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.624.6013&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf The following study found different frequencies in the number of stingers that occur. Incidence of stingers over a six-year study period with only 1.5 stingers per team each season. Most of the stingers reported were either during competitions or preseason. Exactly 93% of stingers were due to player contact, specifically 36.7% occurring while tackling and 25.8% occurring while blocking.  History  In 1976 most major American football leagues banned the technique of spearing in the sport due to the risk of injury. When a player makes head-down contact, that player has much more of a chance of a significant spinal cord injury. After the initial rule change, many of the cervical spine injuries stopped. Therefore, this prompted a new tackling technique to be adopted, such as the head-up tackling technique. This technique does prevent catastrophic spine injuries, but it can result in brachial plexus injuries. After the rule change, it has been estimated that stingers have gone up in prevalence.

In the cytosol, other transporters sequester the dopamine into vesicles for storage and later release. Dopamine reuptake via DAT provides the primary mechanism through which dopamine is cleared from synapses, although there may be an exception in the prefrontal cortex, where evidence points to a possibly larger role of the norepinephrine transporter. DAT is implicated in a number of dopamine-related disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, alcoholism, and substance use disorder. The gene that encodes the DAT protein is located on human chromosome 5, consists of 15 coding exons, and is roughly 64 kbp long. Evidence for the associations between DAT and dopamine related disorders has come from a type of genetic polymorphism, known as a VNTR, in the DAT gene (DAT1), which influences the amount of protein expressed.  Function  DAT is an integral membrane protein that removes dopamine from the synaptic cleft and deposits it into surrounding cells, thus terminating the signal of the neurotransmitter. Dopamine underlies several aspects of cognition, including reward, and DAT facilitates regulation of that signal. Mechanism DAT is a symporter that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and co-transport of two Na+ ions and one Cl‚àí ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase. In the most widely accepted model for monoamine transporter function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane. Studies using electrophysiology and radioactive-labeled dopamine have confirmed that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane with one or two sodium ions. Chloride ions are also needed to prevent a buildup of positive charge. These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient. Because of the tight coupling of the membrane potential and the sodium gradient, activity-induced changes in membrane polarity can dramatically influence transport rates. In addition, the transporter may contribute to dopamine release when the neuron depolarizes. =DAT‚ÄìCav coupling = Preliminary evidence suggests that the dopamine transporter couples to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (particularly Cav1.2 and Cav1.3), which are expressed in virtually all dopamine neurons. As a result of DAT‚ÄìCav coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release. Protein structure The initial determination of the membrane topology of DAT was based upon hydrophobic sequence analysis and sequence similarities with the GABA transporter. These methods predicted twelve transmembrane domains (TMD) with a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth TMDs. Further characterization of this protein used proteases, which digest proteins into smaller fragments, and glycosylation, which occurs only on extracellular loops, and largely verified the initial predictions of membrane topology. The exact structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter (dDAT) was elucidated in 2013 by X-ray crystallography. Location and distribution Regional distribution of DAT has been found in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry including: nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. The nuclei that make up these pathways have distinct patterns of expression. Gene expression patterns in the adult mouse show high expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta. DAT in the mesocortical pathway, labeled with radioactive antibodies, was found to be enriched in dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. This pattern makes sense for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the synapse. Staining in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the mesolimbic pathway was dense and heterogeneous. In the striatum, DAT is localized in the plasma membrane of axon terminals. Double immunocytochemistry demonstrated DAT colocalization with two other markers of nigrostriatal terminals, tyrosine hydroxylase and D2 dopamine receptors. The latter was thus demonstrated to be an autoreceptor on cells that release dopamine. TAAR1 is a presynaptic intracellular receptor that is also colocalized with DAT and which has the opposite effect of the D2 autoreceptor when activated; i.e., it internalizes dopamine transporters and induces efflux through reversed transporter function via PKA and PKC signaling. Surprisingly, DAT was not identified within any synaptic active zones. These results suggest that striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of synaptic specializations once dopamine diffuses from the synaptic cleft. In the substantia nigra, DAT is localized to axonal and dendritic (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes. Within the perikarya of pars compacta neurons, DAT was localized primarily to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation. Genetics and regulation The gene for DAT, known as DAT1, is located on chromosome 5p15. The protein encoding region of the gene is over 64 kb long and comprises 15 coding segments or exons. This gene has a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the 3‚Äô end (rs28363170) and another in the intron 8 region. Differences in the VNTR have been shown to affect the basal level of expression of the transporter; consequently, researchers have looked for associations with dopamine related disorders. Nurr1, a nuclear receptor that regulates many dopamine related genes, can bind the promoter region of this gene and induce expression. This promoter may also be the target of the transcription factor Sp-1. While transcription factors control which cells express DAT, functional regulation of this protein is largely accomplished by kinases. MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, and PKC can modulate the rate at which the transporter moves dopamine or cause the internalization of DAT. Co-localized TAAR1 is an important regulator of the dopamine transporter that, when activated, phosphorylates DAT through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization ( reuptake inhibition), but phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine efflux). Dopamine autoreceptors also regulate DAT by directly opposing the effect of TAAR1 activation. The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. In contrast, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) do not contain zinc binding sites. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Biological role and disorders The rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell. This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters. These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of ADHD. Differences in the functional VNTR have been identified as risk factors for bipolar disorder and ADHD. Data has emerged that suggests there is also an association with stronger withdrawal symptoms from alcoholism, although this is a point of controversy. An allele of the DAT gene with normal protein levels is associated with non-smoking behavior and ease of quitting. Additionally, male adolescents particularly those in high-risk families (ones marked by a disengaged mother and absence of maternal affection) who carry the 10-allele VNTR repeat show a statistically significant affinity for antisocial peers. Increased activity of DAT is associated with several different disorders, including clinical depression. Mutations in DAT have been shown to cause dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, an autosomal recessive movement disorder characterized by progressively worsening dystonia and parkinsonism. Pharmacology The dopamine transporter is the target of substrates, dopamine releasers, transport inhibitors and allosteric modulators. Cocaine blocks DAT by binding directly to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport. In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to or enters synaptic vesicles through . When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKIIŒ±-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine. The dopaminergic mechanisms of each drug are believed to underlie the pleasurable feelings elicited by these substances.  Interactions  Dopamine transporter has been shown to interact with: * Alpha- synuclein, * PICK1, and * TGFB1I1. Apart from these innate protein-protein interactions, recent studies demonstrated that viral proteins such as HIV-1 Tat protein interacts with the DAT and this binding may alter the dopamine homeostasis in HIV positive individuals which is a contributing factor for the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.

In The Horse and his Boy, (the events of which all occur during the reign of the four Pevensie children in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), Hwin and Aravis fall into company with the talking stallion, Bree, to whom Hwin is distantly related, and the boy Shasta. In the course of their adventures, the companions thwart an attempted invasion of Archenland and Narnia, and Hwin, nervous, gentle and humble by nature, passes through testing grounds in which courage and the ability to lead are developed in her.  Name  Hwin's name brings to mind the word \\"whinny\\", a sound that horses make. Primarily, \\"Hwin\\" is a contraction of \\"Hwinhynym\\", which, spelled \\"Houyhnhnm\\" is the name of the race of noble horses from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.  Biographical summary  = Prior story = Hwin was born in Narnia, but was captured as a foal and sold into slavery in Calormen. She became the property of Aravis Tarkeena, a member of the ruling class in Calormen. During her years in slavery, Hwin did not speak, in order to hide her Narnian origin. However, not long before the appearance of Hwin and Aravis in The Horse and His Boy, Hwin has revealed her nature as a talking horse to Aravis, while intervening to prevent Aravis from killing herself to avoid an arranged marriage. Hwin has persuaded Aravis that they should escape together to the free land of Narnia. = In The Horse and His Boy = In this chapter, Hwin and Aravis make their first appearance in the story, driven together with Bree and Shasta by roaring lions. Hwin looks up to Bree as \\"a noble war horse\\", and prefers to accept his \\"assistance and protection\\" on their journey. Although Aravis is the acknowledged leader of the Aravis-Hwin pair, Hwin defends her right to compare escape stories with Bree: \\"No, I won't [be silent], Aravis. This is my escape just as much as yours.\\" Hwin and Bree discover that they know the same places in Narnia, and that they are possibly distantly related. Hwin also plays a vital role in their escape through Tashbaan, but her plan of disguising themselves fails when King Edmund of Narnia mistakes Shasta for Prince Corin of Archenland and Aravis is recognised by a friend. Eventually, the group reunite and head to Archenland. Hwin remains friends with Bree, Shasta (who is later revealed to be Prince Cor of Archenland, Prince Corin's long-lost twin) and Aravis throughout her life, and it is mentioned that she later marries (though not to Bree). Personality Hwin's logical thinking and humility serve as the counter to Bree. Hwin is generally very clear-thinking and reasonable, and though she seems a bit shy at times, her advice is usually the smartest of the group's; it is she, for example, who devises the best plan for getting through Tashbaan (though it doesn't work well for reasons beyond their control). Her wisdom is to be compared to Bree, who is somewhat less sensible and not quite as wise. He also seems to be more concerned than her with what others would think of himfor example, that the other Talking Horses might think his rolling in the grass is silly, while she replies she enjoys it and doesn't care what others think.

The object of the game is to have the fewest cards at the end of the round. Setup The first part of the game is for the dealer to set up the table of cards, called The Bus. This can be done in two ways; =Diamond= This method requires 9 cards, placed in a diamond pattern of 1,2,3,2,1 cards, so that the start and end of the Bus are shorter than the center. If there are eight people, you must arrange an extra row. =Triangle= This requires placing 10 cards face down on the table in a non-overlapping triangle. The triangle consists of 4, 3, 2, and 1 card per layer, with the apex facing the dealer. Deal The dealer deals four cards to each player, beginning on their left. Remaining cards are left aside in the pile. The pile is left aside as it will be used at the end of the round. =Alternate Dealing Pattern= The dealer deals cards to each player in 4 rounds and each time the player gets the answer wrong, he/she must drink: # Player must guess the color of the card (black or red). # Player must guess whether the card is higher or lower. # Player must guess whether the face value of the card is between or outside the previous two cards. # Player must guess the suit of the card (spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts). \\"Riding the Bus\\" The dealer then turns a card in the furthest row of the Bus. All players with a card with the same face value may choose to play as many as they have and then discard the played cards. If a player has a playable card, they nominate any other player to take a drink of the victim's choice. If the card turned over was from the bottom row (4 cards), the player with a playable card can nominate another player to take one drink. Each successive row increases the amount of drinks the nominated player can be forced to take (or the drinks can be distributed amongst several players at the player with the playable card's discretion). Ex. If a player with a playable card plays his/her card in the last row of the bus containing only 1 card, the player can nominate 1 player to take 4 drinks or nominate several players to take a drink. Play continues with the Dealer gradually showing every card in the Bus, being sure to empty each row before uncovering the next. The game ends once the card in the bottom row of the Bus has been acquired. The player with the most cards remaining will continue playing from the beginning using the alternate deal until he/she guesses the answer correct. Aces are neither high and low. Drawing an ace immediately requires a drink and restarts the round. This rule originated in Nova Scotia and has been followed since the mid 90s.

The area of 162.872 sq mi (421.838 km¬≤) surrounds Nett Lake in Koochiching and St. Louis counties. This section comprises Nett Lake, Koochiching County plus Nett Lake, St. Louis County. * The Deer Creek Indian Reservation, at , the second-largest section, comprises 35.109 sq mi (90.931 km¬≤) in Effie unorganized territory in Itasca County, just east of the city of Effie. This reservation was originally set aside for the Little Forks Band of Rainy River Saulteaux. Today, as the population have all relocated onto either the Nett Lake or to the Lake Vermilion Indian Reservation, this reservation is kept as a natural resources reserve for the band. * The smallest section is the Lake Vermilion Indian Reservation (Ojibwe: Onamanii- zaaga'iganiing, \\"At the Lake with Red ochre\\"). It consists of 1.623 sq mi (4.205 km¬≤, or 1,039 acres) of land at in southeastern Greenwood Township on Lake Vermilion just west of the city of Tower in St. Louis County. Set aside by executive order, originally for the Lake Vermilion Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, today this reservation is one of the most accessible reservations for the Band. Consequently, the band operates Fortune Bay Resort Casino, The Wilderness at Fortune Bay golf course, and the Atisokanigamig (Legend House) Heritage Center out of this reservation. There are additional scattered parcels less than in size associated with the reservation. The reservation's total land area is 199.605 sq mi (516.974 km¬≤). Demographics As of the 2000 census, the reservation had a total population of 657; the Nett Lake section had 328, the Itasca County section had 157, and the Lake Vermilion section had 172. The Bois Forte Indian Reservation is a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, who in July 2007, reported 3,052 people enrolled through Bois Forte. History The community first entered into a treaty with the United States in 1854 that set aside an undefined region around Lake Vermilion as a reservation. The regions at Nett Lake and Itasca County were officially established in an 1866 treaty, and the Lake Vermilion lands were defined in an 1881 executive order. Following the Nelson Act of 1898, the lands were surveyed and subdivided, but the U.S. federal government did not force tribe members to move to the White Earth Indian Reservation. 50% of the reservation is wetland, and the 7,300 acre (30 km¬≤) Nett Lake is said to be the largest producer of wild rice in the United States.

Population: History It was founded in 1891. Between 1891 and 1925 it was called Shikhrany (). The town's history is closely linked to the development of the railway. The Moscow‚ÄìKazan line was completed, except for the Imperatorsky Romanovsky railway bridge across Volga, in December 1884 by private Moscow Ryazan Railway Company which was renamed to Moscow Kazan Railway Company on July 11, 1891, which provided all train service in the area up to 1918, when all the remaining private railways were nationalized by the Bolsheviks. The opening of the station, which was then surrounded by woodland, provided a convenient production point for the timber industry, and windmills were built in the area. In 1911, there were more than forty trading firms in Shikhrany. In 1912, a primary school was opened, and in 1914‚Äîa middle school. In 1919, Shikhrany station became a railway junction, when the Arzamas‚ÄìShikhrany line, which had been under construction from 1914, when the last section was completed from the Tsarkli River bridge to Shihrany, and opened to full traffic. The line had been in restricted use with limited car loads since summer 1917. By 1925, when Kanash was granted town status, its population was approximately 2,200. Another station was built in 1926 for goods transit. The first power station, which supplied electricity to the railway station, portions of the town, and thirteen nearby villages, was constructed in 1929. Construction of the Kanash‚ÄìCheboksary line began in 1939, bringing the number of lines connecting Kanash up to four. During World War II, railway production facilities and transit capacity were substantially increased. From the 1950s to the 1970s, local industry was diversified. Factories producing furniture, tools, polymers, and plastics, and car repair factories were built.

Its origin is at the barycenter of the Solar System, with axes that are intended to be \\"fixed\\" with respect to space. ICRS coordinates are approximately the same as equatorial coordinates: the mean pole at J2000.0 in the ICRS lies at 17.3¬±0.2 mas in the direction 12 h and 5.1¬±0.2 mas in the direction 18 h. The mean equinox of J2000.0 is shifted from the ICRS right ascension origin by 78¬±10 mas (direct rotation around the polar axis). The defining extragalactic reference frame of the ICRS is the International Celestial Reference Frame (currently ICRF3) based on hundreds of extra- galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to our current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 arcsecond or better. At optical wavelengths, the ICRS is currently realized by the Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame (HCRF), a subset of about 100,000 stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue.

After the Anschluss in 1938, her family was subjected to Nazi persecution. As a half Jew she was not allowed to continue her studies and became a slave labourer in a button factory. Her sister Helga escaped from Nazism in July 1939 through a Kindertransport to England where she eventually gave birth to a daughter, who became English artist Ruth Rix.\\"World War II saga: Gail Wiltshire revisits Ilse Aichinger‚Äôs novel\\" by Tess Livingstone, The Australian, 8 August 2015 During World War II, Aichinger was able to hide her mother in her assigned room, in front of the Hotel Metropol, the Viennese Gestapo headquarters. But many relatives from her mother's side, among them her grandmother Gisela, whom she was particularly fond of, were sent to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk, and murdered.  Career  In 1945, Aichinger began to study medicine at the University of Vienna, while writing in her spare time. In her first publication, ' (The Fourth Gate), she wrote about her experience under Nazism. In 1947 she and her mother Berta were able to travel to London and visit Aichinger's twin Helga and her daughter Ruth. The visit was the inspiration for a short story, \\"Dover\\". She gave up her studies in 1948 in order to finish her novel, ' (\\"The greater hope\\", translated as Herod's Children). The book went on to become one of the top German-language novels of the twentieth century. It is a surrealist account of a child's persecution by the Nazis in Vienna. In 1949, Aichinger wrote the short story \\"Spiegelgeschichte\\" (). It was published in four parts in an Austrian newspaper, and is well known in Austria because it is part of the set of books taught in schools.See Resler, W. Michael: \\"A Structural Approach to Aichinger's 'Spiegelgeschichte'\\", in: Die Unterrichtspraxis / Teaching German, Vol. 12, No. 1 (Spring, 1979), pp. 30‚Äì37 (jstor-link) The story is written backwards, beginning with the end of the biography of the unnamed woman, and ending with her early childhood.See Stanley, Patricia Haas: \\"Ilse Aichinger's Absurd 'I'\\", in: German Studies Review, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Oct., 1979), pp. 331‚Äì350 (jstor-link). In 1949, Aichinger became a reader for publishing houses in Vienna and Frankfurt, and worked with Inge Scholl to found an Institute of Creative Writing in Ulm, Germany. In 1951, Aichinger was invited to join the writers' group Gruppe 47, a group which aimed to spread democratic ideas in post-war Austria. She read her story \\"Spiegelgeschichte\\" aloud at a meeting of the group, and leading group members such as Hans Werner Richter were impressed with the unusual narrative construction. The following year, she won the group's prize for best text, becoming the first female recipient. In 1956, she joined the Academy of Arts, Berlin. She was also a guest lecturer at the German Institute at the University of Vienna, teaching on literature and psychoanalysis. Reviewing a 1957 volume of her short works in translation, The Bound Man and Other Stories, Anthony Boucher describes Aichinger as \\"a sort of concise Kafka,\\" praising the title story, \\"\\" (\\"The Bound Man\\"), for its \\"narrative use of multi-valued symbolism\\",\\"Recommended Reading\\", F&SF;, July 1957, p. 91. The similarity to Kafka's work has been frequently commented on, however other critics state that Aichinger's work goes beyond Kafka's in her emphasis on the emotional side of human suffering. After the death of her husband, the German poet G√ºnter Eich, in 1972, Aichinger and others edited his works and published them as Collected Works of Gunter Eich. In 1996, at the age of 75, she was the host of a German radio series Studio LCB for the Literary Colloquium Berlin. Aichinger died on 11 November 2016, aged 95.  Personal life  Aichinger met the poet and radio play author G√ºnter Eich through the Group 47 and they were married in 1953; they had a son (1954‚Äì1998), and in 1958 a daughter, Mirjam.

History The first high school classes in Affton were offered in 1930 at 8701 Mackenzie Road in the basement of the former McKenzie School, in a building that now serves as the district administrative office building. The first section of the original building, which was later named W.F. Gaunt High School, was constructed in 1936 at 8520 Mackenzie Road, and 1937 marked the first class to graduate from the new high school. The building is currently the Sanders Work Activity Center. The current high school building was built on a plot in 1955. A classroom and cafeteria addition was added in 1958. Ninth grade students were temporarily moved to McKenzie School in the fall of 1958, back to the Senior High in 1959, and into a new ninth grade center at Gaunt School, after an addition was finished in 1961. The terra cotta cougar and bronze school seal, located in the lobby, were donated by the Classes of 1961 and 1962, respectively. An addition was added in 1963, and in 1965 a bond issue was passed to provide the high school with an auditorium, pool, library and additional classrooms. The \\"pod\\" area of the high school was added in 1969. Ninth grade students were moved back to the high school after the Gaunt school was closed in 1978. Prior to the start of the 2002‚Äì2003 school year, new science labs were added to the science classrooms. In addition, business computer labs, FACS classrooms, Science classrooms and administrative offices were upgraded. This work was made possible by the passing of Proposition A in 2000. A new student commons addition was built on to the existing cafeterias and opened for the 2004‚Äì2005 school year. The commons was made possible by a million-dollar donation from Affton High School alumni Bill ('63) and Nancy ('65) Thompson. A new athletic complex, which included a new football field, bleachers, all-weather track and lights made its debut at the start of the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, with contributions from actor and alumnus John Goodman. Scenes from the 2009 film Up in the Air were shot at Affton High School.'Up In The Air' features St. Louis landmarks - Columbia Missourian On August 12, 2010, the original high school building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. About 20 percent of the school is of Bosnian descent.https://www.stlbosnians.com/bosnian-studies-at-affton-high/ Activities For the 2013‚Äì2014 school year, the school offered 18 activities approved by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA): baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, sideline cheerleading, dance team, 11-man football, boys' golf, music activities, boys' and girls' soccer, softball, boys' and girls' swimming and diving, boys' and girls' track and field, boys' and girls' volleyball, and wrestling.MSHSAA: Affton In addition to its current activities, Affton students have won several state championships, including: *Girls' basketball: 1985MSHSAA: Championship Histories by Sport *Ice Hockey: 1974-1975 State Champions *Ice Hockey: 1999-2000 Wickenheiser Memorial Cup Champions * The school also has had two state individual champions in boys' swimming and diving. Towards the end of the 2018‚Äì2019 school year the school began an Esports team with 5 students. The following year the team expanded past 30 students and the district purchased 10 gaming computers. Towards the end of the 2019-2020 students would not return from their Spring Break following March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic this resulted in the school encouraging participation in the Esports team to retain student engagement in activities. At the start of the 2020‚Äì2021 school year with students remotely learning the district hired a full-time coach for the team.

History In 1994, lawyer and radio personality Enrique Evans Espi√±eira, economic analyst Gonzalo Chamorro Oschilewsky, and Jos√© Artemio Espinosa Mart√≠nez received the first ever UHF television concession in Chile. The station went on the air October 9, 1995, as Gran Santiago Televisi√≥n. The station suffered in its early years from an underpowered signal that failed to cover the entire Santiago Metropolitan Region and from being the only operating UHF outlet in the country. The founders brought with them their programming: Evans Espi√±eira's radio show \\"Gente de Mundo\\" migrated to television, while Chamorro's business program, \\"La Bolsa de Comercio a sus √ìrdenes\\", moved from UCV TV. Espinosa Mart√≠nez would later become a priest. In 1998, the station moved its transmitter from its studios at Praga 555 to San Crist√≥bal Hill. Two years later, five of the controllers of the private Andr√©s Bello National University, who already owned 20 percent of the station, bought the remainder for $1 million and rebranded the channel as Andr√©s Bello Televisi√≥n (ABT). The university built modern studios for the station in the Lo Barnechea area. However, the improvements failed to attract increased viewership. ABT's programming mostly consisted of classic films, Canal Vasco programs, and infomercials. One of its few programming coups was airing the short-lived exclusive soccer highlight program \\"F√∫tbol Total\\", alongside UCV, as part of the rights shakeup that launched CDF. Entertainment magnate Bernardo Carrasco acquired Andr√©s Bello Televisi√≥n in 2005, rebranding the station as Televisi√≥n √ìptima (TVO) and making waves with several notable talent signings. However, many of them ended in surprise exits, most notably when Pamela Jiles was fired by TVO for appearing in a presidential campaign advertisement‚Äîall while the channel touted its \\"pluralist\\" and \\"tolerant\\" editorial stance. Programs on TVO included Estrictamente para mayores, a strand of adult movies, and a program hosted by Eduardo Bonvallet that was constantly mocked on Caiga Quien Caiga. After just a year, Carrasco sold the station to Pabell√≥n de la Construcci√≥n, a real estate showroom, which bought TVO for $2.5 million plus an additional $1.5 million investment in equipment, relaunching it as \\"M√°s Canal\\". Few viewers took notice, and the station typically only made news for business reasons, including layoffs and budget cuts. A low point came in 2008, when national cable operator VTR dropped M√°s Canal from its systems to make way for a Christian channel. =Copesa and failed 3TV project= In July 2010, √Ålvaro Saieh, the 20 percent owner of VTR and media conglomerate Copesa, acquired M√°s Canal for $2.5 million. It was the second major media acquisition for Saieh that year, as he had only bought the VTR stake in January; he also owned La Tercera newspaper and several radio stations. In 2013, Copesa made preparations to relaunch channel 22, which it had renamed \\"M√°s Visi√≥n\\", as \\"3TV\\", with national ambitions. It had bought several television station concessions outside of Santiago to support this launch, while 150 employees had been hired and studios were being prepared. However, financial problems within the group caused the venture to be scuttled before it signed on the air. =CNC Medios ownership= In 2016, Copesa announced that it would sell most of its television station holdings to CNC Inversiones, an Antofagasta- based group headed by Marcelo Mendiz√°bal; this included Canal 22 and channels 21 in Temuco and 35 in Concepci√≥n. On February 1, 2018, Canal 22 changed its name to the present Televisi√≥n Regional de Chile and began broadcasting digitally on channel 14.1.

She first appeared in Showcase #34 (October 1961), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Gil Kane. The character appeared continually in minor roles until the 2004 storyline Identity Crisis, in which she suffered a mental breakdown and responsible for the deaths of Sue Dibny, wife of the Elongated Man, and Jack Drake, father of the third Robin (Tim Drake). This would later lead Loring to assume the mantle of the supervillain Eclipso. Jean Loring, portrayed by Teryl Rothery as the attorney for Oliver Queen and his family, was a recurring character on the CW television series Arrow. Fictional character biography =Lawyer and wife= Ray Palmer. Art by Gil Kane. Jean Loring's career as an attorney in Ivy Town began at almost the same time that her boyfriend, Ray Palmer, became the Atom. Jean encountered the Atom who often helped in her cases many times before learning that he and Ray were the same person. Ray proposed to Jean often, but she rejected him, wanting to make it as a lawyer before becoming a wife. Only when Ray was thought killed in a car accident (engineered by the Bug-Eyed Bandit) did she accept his proposal.The Atom #26 (September 1966) In Atom and Hawkman #45 (November 1969), Jean was abducted and driven insane by the sub-atomic Jimberen race. Although quickly freed from the Jimberen by the Atom and Hawkman, Jean remained insane until Justice League of America #81 (June 1970), when she was cured by the equally insane alien the Jest-Master. After Jean was kidnapped by T. O. Morrow, Ray went into an interdimensional search to retrieve her, asking for help from the Flash, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Captain Comet.Super-Team Family #11-14 (June 1977 ‚Äì January 1978 This event direly affected Jean, and also led to the end of their marriage.Justice League of America #157 For a few years, they were happy ‚Äì but Ray‚Äôs adventurous life began taking its toll on their marriage. Ray caught Jean having an affair with another man and they divorced.Sword of the Atom #1 (1983) Despite the occasional high-profile case, notably her defense of the Justice League of America in Justice League of America (vol. 1) #19 and #77, Jean did not truly come to national prominence until the divorce. Jean soon remarried and with her new husband, Paul Hoben, opened up a law office in Calvin City. She eventually returned to Ivy Town without him and established the firm of Grabemann, Loring and Ross. In general, Jean was not involved in criminal law anymore and attended to more mundane matters such as the administration of the estates of Carter Hall and David Clinton. She made exceptions, though, as in her defense of Risk of the Teen Titans. =Mental breakdown= Jean Loring in Identity Crisis. Art by thumb Jean suffered a mental breakdown as revealed in the 2004 miniseries Identity Crisis. Wanting to resume her relationship with Ray, she came to believe that the surest way to do this was to endanger the loved one of another superhero. She believed that this would send all of the superheroes, including Ray, running back to their spouses and other relatives. Jean used one of Ray's old costumes to shrink down and enter the brain of Sue Dibny, the Elongated Man's wife. She attempted to cause a minor stroke but accidentally applied too much pressure to Dibny's brain and killed her. Jean panicked and used a flamethrower in an attempt to destroy Sue's body before escaping. Unbeknownst to even Sue's husband, Sue had been pregnant. Jean attempted to divert suspicion away from herself by faking an attack on her own life. She then sent out several mysterious death threats to others such as Lois Lane in order to make everyone think that there was a serial killer on the loose who was targeting the loved ones of superheroes. These events caused the superhero community to launch a massive investigation to identify the killer, which resulted in the death of Firestorm at the hands of the Shadow Thief. In the final stage of her plan, Jean set up Captain Boomerang to attack Jack Drake, the father of Tim Drake, the third Robin. Jean had a gun sent to Jack so that he would be able to kill Boomerang in self-defense. Jean's hope was that afterward, everyone would believe that Boomerang had been the killer. Unfortunately for Jean, she miscalculated again and the situation ended in tragedy. Jack and Boomerang killed each other, leaving both of their sons without their fathers. As Jean had originally planned, Ray returned to her. However, during a conversation with Ray about the deaths of Jack and Boomerang, Jean accidentally incriminated herself by asking about the \\"Protect Yourself\\" note that was sent to Jack along with the gun, something that she should not have known about as Batman had removed the note from the crime scene before reporters had arrived. Caught in her lie, Jean confessed everything, and Ray had her institutionalized at Arkham Asylum. =Becoming Eclipso= thumb Infinite Crisis While she is institutionalized, the supernatural entity known as Eclipso (aided by the actions of the Psycho-Pirate and Alexander Luthor of the former Earth-3) manipulates Jean into becoming his new host so she could seduce the Spectre into destroying all of the magical beings in the DC Universe series Day of Vengeance. Due to Eclipso's actions, the Spectre goes on a mass-murdering rampage, killing over 700 magicians. With all their lives in danger, a group of mystics band together, forming the Shadowpact. They recruited Black Alice, a girl who has the ability to steal a person's magical powers for a short amount of time, leaving the being powerless in the process. The Shadowpact uses Black Alice's power to strip the Spectre of his own, leaving him defenseless. They then attempt to kill the Spectre while he is powerless. The plan hits a snag, as without his powers the Spectre is nothing but an empty spirit, leaving him invulnerable. During her brief possession of the Spectre's powers, Black Alice uses them to help fellow Shadowpact member Nightshade send Eclipso into a perpetual orbit around the sun, weakening Eclipso's powers. However, Eclipso's incapacitation did not help the Shadowpact with the Spectre, who continues to wreak havoc and ends up killing the ancient wizard Shazam. After the Spectre kills Nabu, the last and most powerful of the Lords of Order, the Presence's attention is finally drawn to him, and the Spectre is forced into a human host, finally stopping his mad rampage. 52 In Week Twenty-Seven of 52, Ralph Dibny approaches the Spectre as part of his quest to restore his wife Sue to life, promising to fulfill any bargain demanded of him in order to accomplish this. The Spectre, desiring revenge on Eclipso, but rendered incapable of taking it owing to his then-lack of a host (the Spectre had given Crispus a year to be by himself before he became his new host), orders Dibny to punish Eclipso in return for his wife's life; Dibny, temporarily granted the power of the Spectre, takes Eclipso back to the point at which she (as Jean Loring) murdered his wife and, restoring Jean's sanity, intends to trap her in a permanent time loop and force her to watch herself murder Sue Dibny over and over for all eternity. But the now-sane Loring tearfully begs for forgiveness and Dibny - affected by her pleas, his sense of compassion, and his own feelings on watching his wife's death - finds himself incapable of completing his pact with the Spectre. He thus returns Eclipso to her orbit around the sun. Countdown to Final Crisis Blue Beetle #16 shows Eclipso kidnapping a baby with huge raw magical abilities and attempting to corrupt it into a new host for herself. The combined efforts of Blue Beetle and Traci Thirteen foil her plans, steering her attention toward Mary Marvel instead. In Countdown to Final Crisis Eclipso tries to corrupt Mary. Feeding the young girl mistrust and lies, Jean manages to sway Mary from the side of the heroes, corrupting the young girl into becoming her follower. Mary Marvel rebels, and refusing to be given to Darkseid as a concubine, strips Eclipso of her black diamond, blasts her unconscious and leaves Eclipso powerless in space. Eclipso retrieves the diamond and attempts to kill Mary, only to find that Mary is too strong for her. During the battle, Mary calls down the magic lightning bolt, removing Eclipso's power from Jean. In Countdown to Mystery #4, following Mary and Eclipso's battle, the black diamond chooses Bruce Gordon as a host. Jean is shown falling into the ocean near Themiscyra and a shark is seen approaching her. =Blackest Night= Jean Loring as a Black Lantern. Art by thumb In Green Lantern #43, it is confirmed by Black Hand that Jean Loring had died, since he can hear the voice of Death, which is later revealed to be Nekron, the \\"black personification\\" of it.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #43 (July 2009) In the Blackest Night storyline, on the night of the superhero's memorial day, her widower, Ray asks Hawkman to visit her grave to be honored as a fallen member of the community, but Hawkman refuses because of what she did in Identity Crisis.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) Jean is reanimated (off-panel) as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, wearing a costume based on her Eclipso persona. She kills Damage from behind, ripping out his heart as Ray stares in shock. This final kill helps the Black Rings reach a power level of one hundred percent, thus bringing about the rise of Nekron.Blackest Night #4 (October 2009) Jean then uses Ray's own technology to shrink him, Mera and herself into the reanimated Damage's ring.Blackest Night #5 (November 2009) While inside the ring, she relates to Ray and Mera Nekron's origins: that he is the guardian of the darkness that existed before the light entered the universe.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #49 (December 2009) Jean is then possessed by Deadman, who had followed the trio into the ring, who forces her to release Ray and Mera, allowing them to return to normal size.Blackest Night #6 (December 2009) Jean then confronts Ray, who has recently been deputized into the Indigo Tribe, tormenting him with a recreation of her murder of Sue Dibny, and summoning Black Lantern versions of the minuscule tribe Ray had befriended in the Sword of the Atom series to attack him. However, Ray manages to fight back, using his indigo staff to combine the green light of willpower with the indigo light of compassion, using them to destroy Jean and her ring.The Atom and Hawkman #46 (January 2010) Rebirth Following the Rebirth event in 2015, it was revealed in Justice League of America #17 in late 2017 that the elements established in Identity Crisis had been retconned away, and Jean Loring was mentioned as being married once again to Ray Palmer. Other versions Jean Loring makes an appearance in Alex Ross' Justice. She called her husband Ray Palmer when he was shot by Giganta. She sat by his side in the hospital. She is among the sidekicks and loved ones attacked by the Legion of Doom. In other media =Television= Arrowverse Pre-Crisis * Jean Loring appears in the second season of Arrow, portrayed by Teryl Rothery. A defense attorney working in Starling City, she is depicted as a friend and lawyer to Moira Queen, who was on trial for conspiracy to commit murder. Loring ends up winning the case and Moira is found not guilty by the jury. In the sixth season, she returns as Moira's son, Oliver Queen's, defense attorney at his arraignment hearing in \\"Doppelganger\\". In the episode \\"Shifting Allegiances,\\" a news report mentions that Loring was representing Oliver after he is arrested on charges related to vigilantism by the police officers on Ricardo Diaz's payroll. In the episode \\"Docket No. 11-19-41-73\\", Loring does everything she can to prove Oliver's innocence. During this time, Jean learns that Oliver is the Green Arrow. When the jury finds Oliver Queen guilty, Christopher Chance posed as Judge C. McGarvey while Loring calls for judgment notwithstanding verdict procedure. Chance as McGarvey agrees and tells Oliver to seek probation before he is free to go.  In Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow, Ray Palmer had a fiancee named Anna Loring (portrayed by Barbara Kottmeier) who was killed during Slade Wilson's soldiers' attack on Starling City. It is unknown if she had any relation to Jean Loring. Post-Crisis * In season 6 of The Flash, in the episode \\"A Girl Named Sue\\", Sue Dearbon claims to have been hunted by an arms dealer named John Loring (portrayed by Silver Kim) and joins forces with Ralph Dibny to take him down. Loring is later apprehended by the Flash and is taken into custody. =Film= An alternate universe version of Jean Loring appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced by Andrea Romano.

It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.  History  According to the French historian of the environment Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, financial compensation (not named \\"polluter pays principle\\" at that time) is already the regulation principle of pollution favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century. Nic Ulmi, \\"Aux origines de la crise √©cologique\\" [The origins of the ecological crisis], Le temps, 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016). He wrote that: \\"This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves.\\"  Applications in environmental law The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an ecotax, which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment. =Australia= The state of New South Wales in Australia has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of ecologically sustainable development in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i). =European Union= The polluter pays principle is set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Article 191(2) TFEU and Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle.

This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the Swedish government in 1990.The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).\\"Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production\\" Doctoral Dissertation (2000) EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines extended producer responsibility as: > a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a > significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their > products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts > inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from > manufacturers‚Äô production process itself, and downstream impacts from the > use and disposal of the products.

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include: * the Gas Guzzler Tax for motor vehicles * Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), a \\"polluter pays\\" fine. * the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified. In 2003, an amendment was passed negating the \\"polluter pays\\" provision of the Florida Constitution. Limitations of polluter pays principle The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in US laws and programs. For example, drinking water and sewage treatment services are subsidized and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs. =Zimbabwe= The Zimbabwe Environmental Management Act of 2002 Chapter 20:27 prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment.

Several ancient Egyptian deities were depicted and sculptured with cat-like heads such as Mafdet, Bastet and Sekhmet, representing justice, fertility and power. The deity Mut was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat. Cats were praised for killing venomous snakes and protecting the Pharaoh since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt. Skeletal remains of cats were found among funerary goods dating to the 12th Dynasty. The protective function of cats is indicated in the Book of the Dead, where a cat represents Ra and the benefits of the sun for life on Earth. Cat-shaped decorations used during the New Kingdom of Egypt indicate that the cat cult became more popular in daily life. Cats were depicted in association with the name of Bastet. Cat cemeteries at the archaeological sites Speos Artemidos, Bubastis and Saqqara were used for several centuries. They contained vast numbers of cat mummies and cat statues that are exhibited in museum collections worldwide. Among the mummified animals excavated in Gizeh, the African wildcat (Felis lybica) is the most common cat followed by the jungle cat (Felis chaus). In view of the huge number of cat mummies found in Egypt, the cat cult was certainly important for the country's economy, as it required breeding of cats and a trading network for the supply of food, oils and resins for embalming them.  History  Mafdet was the first known cat- headed deity in ancient Egypt. During the First Dynasty 2920‚Äì2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the Pharaoh's chambers against snakes, scorpions and evil. She was often also depicted with a head of a leopard (Panthera pardus). She was particularly prominent during the reign of Den. The deity Bastet is known from at least the Second Dynasty 2890 BC onwards. At the time, she was depicted with a lion (Panthera leo) head. Seals and stone vessels with her name were found in the tombs of the pharaohs Khafra and Nyuserre Ini, indicating that she was regarded as protector since the mid 30th century BC during the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties. A wall painting in the Fifth Dynasty's burial ground at Saqqara shows a small cat with a collar, suggesting that tamed African wildcats were kept in the pharaonic quarters by the 26th century BC. Amulets with cat heads came into fashion in the 21st century BC during the 11th Dynasty. A mural from this period in the tomb of Baqet III depicts a cat in a hunting scene confronting a rat-like rodent. A tomb at the necropolis Umm El Qa'ab contained 17 cat skeletons dating to the early 20th century BC. Next to the skeletons stood small pots that are thought to have contained milk for the cats. Several tomb murals in the Theban Necropolis show cats in domestic scenes. These tombs belonged to nobles and high-ranking officials of the 18th Dynasty and were built in the 15th and 14th centuries BC. The murals show a cat sitting under a chair during a buffet, eating meat or fish; some show it in the company of a goose or a monkey. A cat in hunting and fowling scenes is another recurring motif in murals of Theben tombs. The first known indication for the mummification of a cat was found in an elaborately carved limestone sarcophagus dated to about 1350 BC. This cat is assumed to have been Prince Thutmose‚Äôs beloved pet. From the 22nd Dynasty at around the mid 950s BC onwards, the deity Bastet and her temple in the city of Bubastis grew in popularity. She is now shown only with a small cat head. Domestic cats (Felis catus) were increasingly worshiped and considered sacred. When they died, they were embalmed, coffined and buried in cat cemeteries. The domestic cat was regarded as living incarnation of Bastet who protects the household against granivores, whereas the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was worshipped as protector of the pharaohs. During the reign of Pharaoh Osorkon II in the 9th century BC, the temple of Bastet was enlarged by a festival hall. Cat statues and statuettes from this period exist in diverse sizes and materials, including solid and hollow cast bronze, alabaster and fa√Øence. Mummifying animals grew in popularity during the Late Period of ancient Egypt from 664 BC onwards. Mummies were used for votive offerings to the associated deity, mostly during festivals or by pilgrims. Catacombs from the New Kingdom period in the Bubastis, Saqqara and Beni Hasan necropoli were reused as cemeteries for mummies offered to Bastet. In the mid 5th century BC, Herodotus described the annual festival at the Bubastis temple as the largest in the country, attended by several hundred thousand pilgrims. During the Hellenistic period between 323 and 30 BC, the goddess Isis became associated with Bastet and cats, as indicated by an inscription at the Temple of Edfu: ‚ÄúIsis is the soul of Bastet‚Äù. In this period, cats were systematically bred to be killed and to be mummified as sacrifices to the gods. As described by Diodorus Siculus, killing a cat was regarded a serious crime. In the years between 60 and 56 BC, outraged people lynched a Roman for killing a cat, although pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes tried to intervene. Cats and religion began to be disassociated after Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC. A series of decrees and edicts issued by Roman Emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries AD gradually curtailed the practice of paganism and pagan rituals in Egypt. Pagan temples were impounded and sacrifices prohibited by 380 AD. Three edicts issued between 391 and 392 prohibited pagan rituals and burial ceremonies at all cult sites. Death penalty for offenders was introduced in 395, and the destruction of pagan temples decreed in 399. By 415, the Christian church received all property that was formerly dedicated to paganism. Pagans were exiled by 423, and crosses replaced pagan symbols following a decree from 435. Egypt has since experienced a decline in the veneration once held for cats. They were still respected in the 15th century, when Arnold von Harff travelled to Egypt and observed mamluk warriors treating cats with honour and empathy. Gentle treatment of cats is part of Islamic tradition. Expeditions and excavations In 1799, members of the French Commission des Sciences et des Arts surveyed the old city of Lycopolis near Asyut for the first time and found mummified cats and remains of other animals. They also found mummified cats and cat skeletons in the Theban Necropolis. In the 1820s, the Louvre Museum exhibited cat statues made of wood, bronze, and enameled pottery that originated mostly in Bubastis. Exhibit showing mummified cats at Louvre museum In 1830, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg accounted of having observed three different small cat forms in Egypt: the jungle cat, the African wildcat, and a sacred cat that was intermediate in size between the jungle cat and the domestic cat. He called this cat Felis bubastis. The Egypt Exploration Society funded excavations in Bubastis in the late 1880s. √âdouard Naville accounted of numerous cat statues already available in Cairo shops at the time. At the city's cemetery of cats, he and colleagues emptied several large pits up to a volume of filled with cat and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) bones. Among the bones, some embalming material, porcelain and bronze objects, beads and ornaments, and statues of Bastet and Nefertem were also found. By 1889, the cemetery was considered exhausted. In the late 1880s, more than 200,000 mummified animals most of them cats, were found in the cemetery of Beni Hasan in central Egypt. In 1890, William Martin Conway wrote about excavations in Speos Artemidos near Beni Hasan: \\"The plundering of the cemetery was a sight to see, but one had to stand well windward. The village children came from day to day and provided themselves with the most attractive mummies they could find. These they took down the river bank to sell for the smallest coin to passing travelers. The path became strewn with mummy cloth and bits of cats' skulls and bones and fur in horrid positions, and the wind blew the fragments about and carried the stink afar.\\" In 1890, a shipment of thousands of animal mummies reached Liverpool. Most of them were cat mummies. A large part was sold as fertiliser, a small part was purchased by the zoological museum of the city's university college. The Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon received hundreds of cat mummies excavated by Gaston Maspero at Beni Hasan, Sakkara and Thebes. The cats were of all ages from adult to kittens with deciduous teeth. Some of them were contained in statues and sarcophagi. The larger ones were bandaged in cloth of different colours with decorated heads and ears formed of rubberized tissue. The Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale funded excavations near Faiyum where Pierre Jouguet found a tomb full of cat mummies in 1901. It was located in the midst of tombs with crocodile mummies. In 1907, the British Museum received a collection of 192 mummified cats and 11 small carnivores excavated at Gizeh by Flinders Petrie. The mummies probably date to between 600 and 200 BC. Two of these cat mummies were radiographed in 1980. The analysis revealed that they were deliberately strangulated before they reached the age of two years. They were probably used to supply the demand for mummified cats as votive offerings. Remains of 23 cats were found in the early 1980s in a small mastaba tomb at the archaeological site Balat in Dakhla Oasis. The tomb was established during the Old Kingdom of Egypt in the 25th century BC and reused later. The cats were probably mummified as tissue shreds were still stuck in their bones. Excavations in the Bubasteum area at Saqqara in the early 1980s yielded 200 cat mummies in the tomb of the Vizier Aperel. Another 184 cat mummies were found in a different part of this tomb in the 1990s, comprising 11 packets with a few cat bones and 84 packets containing mud, clay and pebbles. Radiographic examination showed that mostly young cats were mummified; most cats died of skull fractures and had dislocated spinal bones, indicating that they were beaten to death. In this site, the tomb of Tutankhamun's wet nurse Maia was discovered in 1996, which contained cat mummies next to human mummies. In 2001, the skeleton of a male lion was found in this tomb that also showed signs of mummification. It was about nine years old, probably lived in captivity for many years and showed signs of malnutrition. It had probably lived and died in the Ptolemaic period. Mummified remains of 335 domestic and 29 jungle cats were excavated in the catacombs of Anubis at Saqqara during works started in 2009.  Legends  In the 2nd century, Polyaenus accounted of a stratagem allegedly deployed by the Persian king Cambyses II during the Battle of Pelusium (525 BC): Cambyses II ordered placing of cats and other animals venerated by Egyptians before the Persian front lines. Egyptians purportedly stopped their defending operations, and the Persians then conquered Pelusium.

It is the native place of the Shona people. Currently, Mashonaland is divided into three provinces, * Mashonaland West * Mashonaland Central * Mashonaland East In addition, the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, a province unto itself, lies entirely in Mashonaland. Provincial history It was originally one of the regions that the country was divided into following occupation by the Pioneer Column in 1890 and designated the extent of territory under administration of the British South Africa Company as distinct from the remainder of the territory that was directly under the control of the Matabele king, Lobengula, which was named Matabeleland when it was occupied in 1893. The two had separate administrations for part of the BSA Company colonial period. Revolt broke out against the British South Africa Company in 1896, led by priests of the Mwari religion. The British prevailed, executed some leaders, and tried to reform the system. In 1923, the territory became part of the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia and Mashonaland became one of the five provinces. In 1970, an administrative reform led to Mashonaland being divided into a northern and a southern half. Most recently, in 1983, it was divided into the current three sectors and the capital city of Harare was given its own provincial status as well. Since the constitutional amendments that took effect in 1988, each is run by a governor appointed by the president. Geographical features The territory is composed of a broad plateau that slopes gradually to the north and north-west. The lowest land is on its northern border, which is formed by the Zambezi River, with Zambia beyond. A small part straddles the plateau at its south-eastern edge and here the land drains into the Save River but the rest of Mashonaland is part of the Zambezi drainage basin. To the south, the Munyati River forms the border with the current and former province of Midlands. The Nyangadzi river forms the border with Manicaland to the east. Much of the landform is rolling low hills divided by river valleys. About half the land is over altitude and the central watershed in the south and centre is at . Only a few isolated mountains and the spine of the Umvukwes Range in the west rise higher. The highest point is in the Wedza Mountains in the south east at . Economy The region's economy consists of the mining, agriculture and the service industry. Its facilities for tourism, fertile lands and mineral filled regions such as Bindura could improve the economy, but due to poor leadership and policies, the economy is lagging behind. Many Mashonaland citizens are peasant farmers, and gain their source of income from agriculture.

Background Dalhousie was the eldest son of William Maule, 1st Baron Panmure, and a grandson of George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie. Christened Fox as a compliment to Charles James Fox, the great Whig, he served for a term in the Army. This cites G. Douglas and G. D. Ramsay (editors), Panmure Papers, 1908.

In the ministry of Lord Melbourne (1835‚Äì1841), Maule was Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and under Lord John Russell, he was Secretary at War from July 1846 to January 1852, when for two or three weeks he was President of the Board of Control. In April 1852, he succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Panmure. In February 1855, he joined Lord Palmerston's cabinet, filling the new office of Secretary of State for War. Lord Panmure held this office until February 1858. He was at the War Office during the concluding period of the Crimean War, and met a good deal of criticism. He was Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland from 1853 until his death. Always interested in church matters, Dalhousie was a prominent supporter of the Free Church of Scotland after it split from the Church of Scotland in the disruption of 1843. In December 1860, he succeeded his kinsman, the 1st Marquess of Dalhousie, as 11th Earl of Dalhousie. He shortly afterwards changed his surname to \\"Maule-Ramsay\\" (his father had changed his surname to \\"Maule\\" from the family's patronymic \\"Ramsay\\" before being created Baron Panmure).  Freemasonry  Maule was appointed Senior Grand Warden of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1832, and later (as Lord Panmure) Deputy Grand Master in 1857. He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1867. In 1860, Panmure Lodge (now No. 723) was warranted, being named after the then Deputy Grand Master. Marriage Lord Dalhousie married the Hon. Montague, daughter of George Abercromby, 2nd Baron Abercromby, in 1831. They had no children. She died in November 1853, aged 46. Lord Dalhousie died July 1874, aged 73. On his death, the barony of Panmure became extinct, but the earldom of Dalhousie (and its subsidiary titles) passed to his cousin, George Ramsay.

The tribe was created on June 18, 1934; the organization and its governmental powers are divided between the tribe, and the individual bands, which directly operate their reservations. The bands that make up the tribe are: *Bois Forte Band of Chippewa *Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa *Grand Portage Band of Chippewa *Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe *Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe *White Earth Band of Ojibwe As of July 2003, the six bands have 40,677 enrolled members. The White Earth Band is the largest, which had more than 19,000 members. According to the 2010 US Census, the Leech Lake Band had 10,660 residents living on its reservation, the most of any single reservation in the state. Notably, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa is not part of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 1934 it declined to participate, as its citizens did not want to give up the band's system of hereditary chiefs. The Red Lake Band developed its constitution in the 1950s, electing its first chairman in 1959. The Chippewa nation predates the European colonization of the Americas. Services The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe provides basic services to each of its six-member Bands, unless the individual Band has signed a compact to provide these services themselves.

The band's land base is the White Earth Indian Reservation. Historically, the tribe was formed from the unification of Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) bands from the northern part of the state who were displaced by European settlement. These bands are: * Gull Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa * Removable Mille Lacs Indians * Rabbit Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa * Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa With 19,291 members in 2007, the White Earth Band is the largest of the six component bands of the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, formed after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. It is also the largest band in the state of Minnesota. History On March 19, 1867, the US Congress established the White Earth Indian Reservation for the Mississippi Chippewa Indians in Minnesota, following ratification of a treaty between them and the United States. Congress had several session agreements regarding the White Earth Band of Ojibwe. After hearing many complaints about the Pillagers, who were then landless, Congress authorized the relocation of the western Pillagers to the White Earth Indian Reservation. They had not been included in the 1855 Treaty of Washington (), which was made with the eastern Pillagers at the Mississippi River headwaters. Eventually the Otter Tail Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians and Wild Rice River Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians also came to settle alongside the Mississippi Chippewa at White Earth Reservation and effectively became part of the White Earth Band. Up until the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the six historical component bands located on the White Earth Indian Reservation acted independently of each other. Following the Reorganization Act, the six wrote a constitution to form the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They divided Minnesota into six Band districts, and unified those scattered Ojibwe bands that were not associated with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, which did not join the Tribe. The six component bands located on the White Earth Indian Reservation were unified into the single White Earth Band of Ojibwe of today. The six Minnesota Chippewa Tribe bands continue to enroll members separately, but also combine their numbers for the entire tribe. According to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, the White Earth Band had 19,291 enrolled members in July 2007. It is the largest of the six bands in the Tribe, and the largest of any band in the state.

The Bois Forte Band is one of six constituent members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 2007, the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe reported having 3,052 people enrolled through the Bois Forte (Nett Lake) Reservation as members of the Bois Forte Band. History The Bois Forte Band is an amalgamation of three separate groups, of which the Zagwaandagaawininiwag was the largest component, also known on some documents as Zoongaatigwitoonag (\\"Strong-wooded Ones\\", reflected in French as \\"Les Songatikitons\\"). Others now considered part of the Bois Forte Band includes the Lake Vermilion Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the southern half of the Little Forks Band of Rainy River Saulteaux. Due to their very peaceful existence, Warren reports they were called the \\"Rabbit\\" (Ojibwe language: Waabooz). Under the Treaty of Paris (1783) and the Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842), the Little Forks Band of Rainy River Saulteaux were divided in half, with the southern half living about the Little Fork River being in the United States. The Lake Vermilion Band went into a treaty relationship with the United States in 1854. In 1866, the Bois Forte Band entered into a treaty with the United States, which also began the amalgamation process of these three historical bands into a single Band of today. Ethnonyms The Bois Forte Band are named after their location of thick conifer forest of northern Minnesota.

She has been a member of supervillain groups, including the Alliance of Evil and the Acolytes, as well as the superhero team the X-Men. Publication history Frenzy first appeared in X-Factor #4 (May 1986) as a member of the Alliance of Evil, and was created by Bob Layton and Keith Pollard. Though Joanna Cargill's first and last name have been spelled with variations such as Johanna or Cargil, her name was first mentioned in Uncanny X-Men #298 as Joanna Cargill. Frenzy should not be confused with another Joanna Cargill, a columnist introduced in Marvel Comics Presents #27. During a March 2, 2011 Marvel Comics Liveblog, it was revealed that Frenzy is joining X-Men: Legacy in 2011 as a member of Rogue's team of X-Men, alongside Professor X, Magneto, Legion, and Gambit.http://marvel.com/news/story/15282/tune_in_to_year_of_the_x- men_liveblogs Fictional character biography =Early life= The woman who would one day become the super-powered mutant, Frenzy, began her life as a battered child in an abusive household. Her father, an officer in the Armed Forces, despised her from birth not only because of her gender - he instead doted on his son in whom, according to Cargill, he saw a continuation of the family legacy as soldiers - but also because she was born prematurely, and was a sickly, frail child, greatly increasing the financial burdens on the family. Her mother, meanwhile, was thoroughly cowed by her husband's abuse, and did nothing to stop the beatings he would constantly inflict on his daughter for even seemingly minor infractions. One day, not long after his son was killed in action, he took his rage out on his daughter for the death of his son, seemingly wanting to beat her to death. Either her rage or her fear awakened her mutant powers as he beat her savagely, and she unintentionally punched straight through his body with a single blow, killing him instantly. Shocked at what she had done, albeit accidentally, she ran away from home.X-Men: Legacy, vol. #1, #268, June 2012.

Various features of the forelimbs, skull and pelvis unite these finds as both theropods and maniraptorans, close relatives to birds. The representative genus, Therizinosaurus, is derived from the Greek Œ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ∂œâ (ther√≠zo, meaning scythe, reap or cut) and œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (sauros, meaning lizard). The older representative, Segnosaurus, is derived from the Latin word segnis (meaning slow) and the Greek œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (sauros, meaning lizard). History of research Forelimbs of Therizinosaurus, specimen IGM 100/15 displayed at Nagoya City Science Museum Therizinosaurs were long considered an enigmatic group, whose mosaic of features resembling those of various different dinosaur groups, and scarcity of their fossils, led to controversy over their evolutionary relationships for decades after their initial discovery. The first genus, Therizinosaurus, was originally identified as a turtle when described from forelimb elements in 1954. Translated paper Perle noted in 1979 that the Segnosaurus fossils were possibly representative of a new family of dinosaurs, which he tentatively classified as theropods (traditionally thought of as the \\"meat-eating\\" dinosaurs). He named the family Segnosauridae, with Segnosaurus as type genus and sole member. He distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families Deinocheiridae and Therizinosauridae (then only known from the genera Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus, both mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia) by features of their humeri and hand claws. Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids so different from those of \\"true\\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of infraorder within Saurischia (one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs, the other being Ornithischia). In 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus Erlikosaurus (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton) which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid, and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as Segnosaurus. Combined, the specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial, and were distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods (perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early), and therefore warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with them. Since the Erlikosaurus specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure if that of the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to it, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family. Though Erlikosaurus was difficult to compare directly to Segnosaurus due to the incompleteness of their remains, Perle stated in 1981 that there was no justification for separating it into another family. Reconstructed pelvis and metatarsus of the holotype of Segnosaurus, which together with Erlikosaurus became the basis of the new infraorder Segnosauria; this group is now a synonym of Therizinosauria In 1982, Perle reported hindlimb fragments similar to those of Segnosaurus, and assigned them to Therizinosaurus, whose forelimbs had been found in almost the same location. He concluded that Therizinosauridae, Deinocheiridae, and Segnosauridae, which all had enlarged forelimbs, represented the same taxonomic group. Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus were particularly similar, leading Perle to suggest they belonged in a family to the exclusion of Deinocheiridae (today, Deinocheirus is recognized as an ornithomimosaur). Translated paper Barsbold retained Segnosaurus and Erlikosaurus in the family Segnosauridae in 1983, and named the new genus Enigmosaurus based on the previously undetermined segnosaurian pelvis, which he placed in its own family, Enigmosauridae, within Segnosauria. Though the structure of the pelvis of Erlikosaurus was unknown, Barsbold considered it unlikely the Enigmosaurus pelvis belonged to it, since Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus were so similar in other respects, while the pelvis of Enigmosaurus was very different from that of Segnosaurus. Barsbold found that segnosaurids were so peculiar compared to more typical theropods that they were either a very significant deviation in theropod evolution, or that they went \\"beyond the borders\\" of this group, but opted to retain them within Theropoda. Translated paper In the same year, Barsbold stated that the segnosaurian pelvis deviated strongly from the theropod norm, and found the configuration of their ilia generally similar to those of sauropods. Translated paper Outdated restoration of a prosauropod-like, quadrupedal Erlikosaurus. Therizinosaurs were often depicted this way until they were definitively identified as theropods Paleontologist Gregory S. Paul concluded in 1984 that segnosaurs did not possess any theropodan features, but were instead derived, late-surviving Cretaceous prosauropods with adaptations similar to those of ornithischians. He found segnosaurs similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot, and to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle, and similar to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods, and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relict of this transition, which supposedly took place during the Triassic period. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to be to herbivorous dinosaurs what monotremes are to mammals. He did not rule out that segnosaurs could be derived from theropods, or that segnosaurs, prosauropods and ornithischians were each independently derived from early dinosaurs, but found these options unlikely. He considered the common descent of these groups as support for the idea that dinosaurs were a monophyletic (natural) group, which was contested by some paleontologists at the time (who instead thought different dinosaurs groups evolved independently from thecodonts). Paleontologist David B. Norman considered Paul's idea a contentious claim \\"bound to provoke much argument\\" in 1985. In 1988, Paul maintained that segnosaurs were late surviving ornithischian-like prosauropods, and proposed a segnosaurian identity for Therizinosaurus. He also placed segnosauria within Phytodinosauria, a superorder that palaontologist Robert Bakker had created in 1985 to retain all plant-eating dinosaurs. In a 1986 study of the interrelationships of saurischian dinosaurs, paleontologist Jacques Gauthier concluded that segnosaurs were prosauropods. While he conceded they had similarities with ornithischians and theropods, he proposed these featured had evolved independently. In a 1989 conference abstract about sauropodomorph interrelatonships, paleontologist Paul Sereno also considered segnosaurs as prosauropods, based on skull features. Reconstructed skeleton of Alxasaurus from China, the completeness of which confirmed therizinosaurs as theropods in 1993 In a 1990 review article, Barsbold and paleontologist Teresa Marya≈Ñska found Segnosauria to be a rare and aberrant group of saurischians, in an unresolved position among sauropodomorphs and theropods, probably closer to the former. They therefore listed them as Saurischia sedis mutabilis (\\"position subject to change\\"). Though they agreed the hindlimbs assigned to Therizinosaurus in 1982 were segnosaurian, they did not consider this justification for Therizinosaurus itself being a segnosaur, since it was only known from forelimbs. In 1993, paleontologists Dale A. Russell and Dong Zhi- Ming described the new genus Alxasaurus from China, at the time the most complete large theropod from its time and place. While it was similar to prosauropods in some respects, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to Therizinosaurus and segnosaurs. Since it preserved both fore and hindlimbs, Alxasaurus showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to Therizinosaurus was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a junior synonym of Therizinosauridae (since the latter name was older), with Alxasaurus being the most completely known representative so far, providing a better understanding of the group. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank Therizinosauroidea to contain Alxasaurus and Therizinosauridae (since the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives), which they placed in the group Tetanurae within Theropoda. They considered therizinosaurs most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group Oviraptorosauria (since they found Maniraptora, the conventional grouping of these, invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux at the time). basal therizinosaur Beipiaosaurus with impressions of feather structures, Paleozoological Museum of China The synonymy of Segnosauridae with Therizinosauridae was accepted by Perle himself and co-authors of a redescription of the holotype skull of Erlikosaurus in 1994, and they considered therizinosaurs maniraptoran theropods, the group that also includes modern birds (since they did find Maniraptora to be valid through their analysis). They also discussed the previous ornithischian and sauropod hypotheses for therizinosaur affinities in detail and demonstrated various faults with them. Palaeontologist Lev Alexandrovich Nessov rejected that therizinosaurs were theropods in 1995, and instead considered them a distinct group within saurischia.Nessov, L. A., 1995, Dinosaurs of northern Eurasia: New data about assemblages, ecology and paleobiogeography. Saint Petersburg In 1996, paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz Jr. found therizinosaurs to group with oviraptorosaurs in a phylogenetic analysis of coelurosauria. In 1999, paleontologist Xing Xu and colleagues described a small, basal therizinosauroid from China, Beipiaosaurus, which confirmed that the group belonged among the coelurosaurian theropods, and that similarities with prosauropods had evolved independently. They published the first ever cladogram showing the evolutionary relationships of Therizinosauria, and demonstrated that Beipiaosaurus had features of more basal theropods, coelurosaurs, and therizinosaurs. By the early 21st century, many more therizinosaur taxa had been discovered, including outside Asia (the first being Nothronychus from North America), as well as various basal taxa that helped understanding of the early evolution of the group (such as Falcarius, also form North America). Therizinosaurs were not considered as rare or aberrant anymore, but more diverse than previously thought (including in size), and their classification as maniraptoran theropods was generally accepted. The placement of Therizinosauria within Maniraptora continued to be unclear; in 2017, paleontologist Alan H. Turner and colleagues found them to group with oviraptorosaurs, while Zanno and collagues found them to be the most basal clade within Maniraptora in 2009, bracketed by Ornithomimosauria and Alvarezsauridae. Despite the additional fossil material, the interrelations within the group were also still uncertain by 2010, when Zanno conducted the most detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria until that point. She cited the inaccessibility, damage, potential loss of holotype specimens, scarcity of cranial remains, and fragmentary specimens with few overlapping elements as the most significant obstacles to resolving the evolutionary relationships within the group. Description Life restoration of Beipiaosaurus inexpectus Therizinosaurs spanned a large range of sizes, from the smaller Beipiaosaurus ( long) and Jianchangosaurus ( long) to the large-sized long Segnosaurus and Suzhousaurus. Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Therizinosaurus itself, obtained the top dimensions of the group, growing up to long and weighing over , dimensions that make the genus among the largest-known theropods. Therizinosaurs had a very distinctive, often confusing set of characteristics. Their long necks, wide torsos, and hind feet with four toes used in walking resembled those of basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Their unique hip bones, which pointed backwards and were partially fused together, initially reminded paleontologists of the \\"bird-hipped\\" ornithischians. Among the most striking characteristics of therizinosaurs are the enormous claws on their hands, which reached lengths of around one meter in Therizinosaurus. The unusual range of motion in therizinosaur forelimbs, which allowed them to reach forward to a degree other theropods could not achieve, also supports the idea that they were mainly herbivorous. Therizinosaurs may have used their long reach and strongly curved claws to grasp and shear leafy branches, in a manner similar to large mammals that lived later on, such as chalicotheres, ground sloths, great apes, and giant pandas.* Burch, S. (2006). \\"The range of motion of the glenohumeral joint of the therizinosaur Neimongosaurus yangi (Dinosauria: Theropoda).\\" Chicago Biological Investigator, 3(2): 20. (Abstract). Skin impressions from Beipiaosaurus indicate that therizinosaurs were covered with a coat of primitive, down-like feathers similar to those seen in the compsognathid Sinosauropteryx, as well as longer, simpler, quill-like feathers that may have been used in display. Classification and systematics =Taxonomy= Hips from different genera Barsbold and Perle named the group Segnosauria as an infraorder of Theropoda in 1980. Dong Zhiming went further, placing the segnosaurs in their own order, Segnosaurischia. This name has been abandoned since the discovery that segnosaurs are a specialized group within the suborder Theropoda. Clark et al. 2004 considered Segnosaurischia a synonym of Therizinosauroidea. The infraorder Therizinosauria was first coined by Dale Russell in 1997‚Äîeffectively replacing the older name Segnosauria, which has not yet been defined as a clade‚Äîto contain all therizinosaurian dinosaurs. The superfamily Therizinosauroidea was first coined in 1993 as a superfamily with no phylogenetic definition. The family Therizinosauridae had been established by Maleev in 1954 to include only the bizarre, giant-clawed theropod Therizinosaurus. Subsequent analyses have proven this family to be more diverse and synonymous with Segnosauridae. The following taxonomy follows Zanno 2010, unless otherwise noted. *Branch Therizinosauria Genus Falcarius Genus Martharaptor Genus Jianchangosaurus Superfamily Therizinosauroidea *Genus Beipiaosaurus *Genus Enigmosaurus *Genus Erliansaurus (more related to Therizinosauridae) *Genus Neimongosaurus (more related to Therizinosauridae) *Genus Suzhousaurus *Family Alxasauridae (dubious utility) *Family Therizinosauridae =Phylogeny= Skeletons of various genera (not to scale) Therizinosauria is defined as Alxasaurus, Enigmosaurus, Erlikosaurus, Nanshiungosaurus, Segnosaurus, Therizinosaurus, and all taxa closer to them than to oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimids, and troodontids. Paul Sereno, in 2005, modified this definition to the most inclusive clade containing Therizinosaurus but not Ornithomimus, Oviraptor, Shuvuuia, Tyrannosaurus, or Troodon.Sereno, P. C. 2005. Stem Archosauria‚ÄîTaxonSearch [version 1.0, 2005 November 7] When it was later realized that Therizinosaurus was an advanced therizinosaur more related to Alxasaurus than other dinosaur lineages, Therizinosauroidea was coined to include Alxasaurus and Therizinosauridae, and has largely replaced the use of the older name Segnosauria in phylogenetic studies, mainly because of the association of the name Segnosauria with the discredited idea that these animals were relatives of prosauropods. Therizinosauroidea was first defined by Zhang et al. in 2001, as the clade containing all theropods more closely related to Therizinosaurus than to birds. This definition, however, defines the same group as the pre- existing Therizinosauria. An alternate definition was given by Clark in 2004 (as the last common ancestor of Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus and all its descendants), comprising a narrower group that excludes more primitive therizinosaurs, such as Falcarius, and allows the name Therizinosauria to remain in use for the larger group comprising all therizinosaurs.Clark, J.M., Maryanska, T., and Barsbold, R. (2004). \\"Therizinosauroidea.\\" Pp. 151‚Äì 164 in Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria, Second Edition. University of California Press., 861 pp. This definition was followed by Sereno (2005), Zanno et al. (2009) and Zanno (2010), though other subsequent studies, such as Senter (2007, 2012) have continued to use Therizinosauroidea for the therizinosaur \\"total group\\". The cladogram below follows the extensive phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria by Lindsay E. Zanno in 2010. Below is the recently performed phylogenetic analysis performed by Hartman et al. 2019 using the data provided by Zanno in 2010: Paleobiology =Senses= CT scans published by Stephan Lautenschlager et al. 2012 focused on the skull and brain cavity of Erlikosaurus, revealing it to have a large forebrain, and suggesting it had well developed senses of balance, hearing and smell, all of which would have been useful in evading predators, finding food, or in performing complex social behavior. These senses were also well-developed in earlier coelurosaurs and other theropods, indicating that therizinosaurs may have inherited many of these features from their carnivorous ancestors and used them for their specialized dietary purposes. =Reproduction= Life restoration of an embryonic therizinosaur based on fossils from the Nanchao Formation Dinosaur eggs with embryos of the Dendroolithidae type from the Nanchao Formation were identified as belonging to therizinosaurs based on anatomical features, and described by paleontologist Martin Kundr√°t and colleagues in 2007. The development of the embryos (their bones were extensiely ossified) and the fact that no adults were found in association with the nests indicate that theirzinosaur hatchlings were precocial, capabale of locomotion from birth, and able to leave their nests to feed alone, independently of their parents. The development of the teeth of the hatchlings was consistent with an omnivorous diet. Subterraneously constructed nests are also indicative of a lack of parental care during the incubation period. In a 2013 conference abstract, paleontologist Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and colleagues reported a nesting ground of theropod dinosaurs at the Javkhlant Formation, which contained at least 17 egg clutches from the same layer within an area of 22 m by 52 m. Each clutch contained 8 spherical eggs with rough surfaces which were in contact with each other and arranged in a circular structure without a central opening. Based on microscopical features in the eggshells, the researchers identified the eggs as the type Dendroolithidae, which had previously been attributed to therizinosaurs. Though therizinosaurs are not known from the Javkhlant Formation, it overlies the Bayan Shireh Formation, where Segnosaurus, Erlikosaurus, and Enigmosaurus were found. The multiple clutches indicate that some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters, like hadrosaurs, prosauropods, titanosaurs, and birds, and the fact that they were found in a single stratigraphic layer suggests the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion, and therefore did not exhibit site fidelity. The discovery was the first record of colonially nesting non-avian theropods from Asia, as well as the largest known non-avian theropod colony.

In 1837 some of his writings were published as Diario de la Navegaci√≥n Emprendida en 1781, Desde el Rio Negro, para Reconocer la Bahia de Todos los Santos, las Islas del Buen Suceso, y el Desague del Rio Colorado.  Early life  Basilio Villarino was born in Noia, Spain, in 1741.  Voyages  In 1773 Villarino arrived to the Rio de la Plata as assistant pilot of the frigate Perpetua, commanded by Captain Bustillos. From 1778 he performed a detailed reconnaissance of the Patagonia, during which he explored the sea shores and the rivers Negro, Colorado, Limay and Deseado among others. In 1779 he participated in the expedition led by Francisco de Viedma, during which the town of Carmen de Patagones was founded; in 1782 he navigated the rivers Negro, Limay and Coll√≥n Cur√° in four chalupas called San Jose, San Juan, San Francisco de Asis and Champagne, accompanied by a local chieftain. In 1783 he discovered the Choele Choel island, although the exploration is suspended due to the permanent attack of the natives.  Death  Villarino was killed by the aboriginals in January 1785, during an expedition to Sierra de la Ventana commanded by Juan de la Piedra.  Legacy  In Argentina, Villarino's legacy as an explorer of Patagonia has been recognized by naming several places after him, including: a lake and a river in Neuqu√©n, a department subdivision in Buenos Aires (Villarino Partido), and some schools. An Argentine Navy 1880s steamer, used on the Patagonian routes, was named after him.Transporte ARA Villarino,\\"Histarmar\\" website (accessed 2016-10-22)  See also  ARA Villarino - Argentine Navy 1880s ship * Villarino Lake - in Neuquen, Argentina  References  = Notes = = Bibliography =  Further reading   *  External links  * Spanish naval officers Spanish male writers Spanish explorers 1741 births 1785 deaths Spanish explorers of South America ","title":"Basilio Villarino"},{"id":"1846692","text":"Matthias I may refer to: * Matthias I, Duke of Lorraine (1119‚Äì1176) * Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1443‚Äì1490) * Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor (1557‚Äì1619) ","title":"Matthias I"},{"id":"1846697","text":"The Type 10 or 12 cm/45 10th Year Type naval gun was a Japanese 120 mm calibre dual purpose anti-aircraft and coastal defense gun used during the Second World War.

He notices some changes in Cuba caused by the rebellion. He checks into a hotel and is contacted by one of Castro's agents, a female, who takes him to a beach resort. He meets a young man who offers to take Errol behind the lines to meet Castro. Flynn flies his own plane, meets the rebels, and files several articles, including one of the Cuban Rebel Girls. The movie then goes into the story of two American girls, Beverly and her friend, Jacqueline, whose brother Johnny (Beverly's boyfriend) is fighting for Castro in Cuba. The two girls decide to visit Cuba. They take $50,000 raised by American friends of the revolution to be used to buy guns. They visit Key West and then fly to Cuba.

She spent her childhood and early youth in Ireland. From her father, a college professor, she learned the ideal of service to mankind as the true service to God. She worked as a school teacher and later also opened a school. She was engaged to marry a Welsh youth, but he died soon after their engagement. Sister Nivedita met Swami Vivekananda in 1895 in London and travelled to Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), India in 1898. Swami Vivekananda gave her the name Nivedita (meaning \\"Dedicated to God\\") when he initiated her into the vow of Brahmacharya on 25 March 1898. In November 1898, she opened a girls' school in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta. She wanted to educate girls who were deprived of even basic education. During the plague epidemic in Calcutta in 1899, Nivedita nursed and took care of the poor patients. Nivedita had close associations with the newly established Ramakrishna Mission. Because of her active contribution in the field of Indian Nationalism, she had to publicly dissociate herself from the activities of the Ramakrishna Mission under the then president Swami Brahmananda. She was very close to Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Ramakrishna and one of the major influences behind Ramakrishna Mission, and also with all brother disciples of Swami Vivekananda. She died on 13 October 1911 in Darjeeling. Her epitaph reads, \\"Here lies Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India\\".  Early life  Margaret Elizabeth Noble was born on 28 October 1867 in the town of Dungannon in County Tyrone, Ireland to Mary Isabel and Samuel Richmond Noble; she was named for her paternal grandmother. The Nobles were of Scottish descent, settled in Ireland for about five centuries.Atmaprana, p. 1 Her father, who was a pastor, taught that service to mankind is the true service to God. The Nobles had six children of whom only Margaret (the eldest), May, and Richmond survived. When Margaret was one year old Samuel moved to Manchester, England; there he enrolled as a theological student of the Wesleyan Church. Young Margaret stayed with her maternal grandfather, Hamilton, in Ireland. When she was four years old she returned to live with her parents at Great Torrington in Devonshire. Margaret was her father's favorite child. When Samuel Noble conducted services or visited the poor, she accompanied him. Margaret's father died in 1877 when she was ten years old. Margaret with her mother and two siblings returned to her grandfather Hamilton's home in Ireland. Margaret's mother, Mary took up a kindergarten course in London and became a teacher. Later, Mary helped her father to run a guest-house near Belfast. Hamilton was one of the first-ranking leaders of the freedom movement of Ireland. Besides her father's religious temperament, Margaret imbibed the spirit of freedom and love for her country through her grandfather Hamilton. Margaret was educated at Halifax College, run by a member of the Congregationalist Church. The headmistress of this college taught her about personal sacrifice. She studied subjects, including physics, arts, music, and literature. At the age of seventeen in 1884, she first started a career in teaching at a school in Keswick. In 1886, she went to Rugby to teach in an orphanage. A year later, she took up a post at the coal- mining area Wrexham in North Wales. Here, she revived her spirit of service and love for the poor which she had inherited from her father. At Wrexham, Margaret became engaged to be married to a Welsh youth who died soon after the engagement. In 1889, Margaret moved to Chester. By this time, her sister May and brother Richmond were living in Liverpool. Soon, their mother Mary joined them. Margaret was happy to be reunited with her family. Occasionally, she went to Liverpool to stay with them.Atmaprana, p. 3 Margaret resumed her studies in the field of education.\\"As a Teacher\\". Freeindia.org. Retrieved 12 June 2012. She became acquainted with the ideas of the Swiss education reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and with the German Friedrich Fr√∂bel. Both Pestalozzi and Froebel emphasized the importance of preschool education. They opined that education should begin by gratifying and cultivating the normal aptitude of the child for exercise, play, observation, imitation, and construction. A group of teachers in England was attracted to this novel method of teaching and they tried to put it into practice. Thus, the 'New Education' was advocated and Margaret, too, became a part of it. Soon, she became a favourite writer and speaker at the Sunday Club and the Liverpool Science Club.Atmaprana, pp. 3‚Äì4 In 1891, Margaret settled in Wimbledon and helped a Mrs. de Leeuw, to start a new school in London. The new experiment in teaching gave her great joy. After a year, in 1892, Margaret started her own independent school at Kingsleygate. At her school, there were no restrictive set methods and formal learning. Children learned through play. At this time, Margaret learned to be a critic of art from one of her staff teachers, Ebenezer Cooke, a well-known art master and reformer of art education. As she gained mastery as an educator, she also became a prolific writer in paper and periodicals and a popular speaker. Soon she became a name among the intellectuals of London and became acquainted with some of the most learned and influential people of her time. Among them were Lady Ripon and Lady Isabel Margesson. They were the founders of a literary coterie, which came to be known as the Sesame Club. The Times of London of 26 October 1911, wrote about Margaret, \\"A trained teacher of exceptional gifts, she was one of a group of educationists who in the early nineties founded the Sesame Club.\\" Famous writers, such as Bernard Shaw and Thomas Huxley, were some of the regular speakers at the Sesame Club. Discussions were held here on literature, ethics, politics, and other similar subjects. In 1892, when the Home Rule Bill for Ireland was before the Parliament, Margaret spoke fearlessly in favor of it.  Seeker of Truth  Coming from a religious background, Margaret had learned Christian religious doctrines from a young age. From childhood, she had learned to venerate all religious teachings. The infant Jesus was her object of adoration and worship. However, as she bloomed into womanhood, doubt in the Christian doctrines crept in. She found the teachings were incompatible with Truth. As these doubts became stronger, her faith in Christianity was shaken. For seven long years, Margaret was unable to settle her mind and this led to unhappiness. She tried to absorb herself in church service. However, her troubled soul could not find satisfaction and she longed for Truth.The Complete Works of Sister Nivedita, Vol. II, p. 470 Search for truth made Margaret take up the study of natural science. Later, in a lecture delivered at the Hindu Ladies' Social Club in Bombay in 1902, she said:  Meeting with Swami Vivekananda  Sister Nivedita In November 1895, she met Swami Vivekananda for the first time, who had come from America to visit London and stayed there for three months.The Complete Works of Sister Nivedita, Vol. I On a cold afternoon, Swami Vivekananda was explaining Vedanta philosophy in the drawing room of an aristocratic family in London. Lady Isabel Margesson, a friend of Margaret, invited Ebenezer Cooke, who was part of the teaching staff at Margaret's 'Ruskin School', to this meeting. Margaret went with him, with much curiosity and interest. Margaret did not know this evening would change her life completely. Margaret described her experience of the occasion. \\"A majestic personage, clad in a saffron gown and wearing a red waistband, sat there on the floor, cross-legged. As he spoke to the company, he recited Sanskrit verses in his deep, sonorous voice.\\" Margaret had already delved deeply into the teachings of the East, and the novelty was not what she heard on this occasion, but the personality of Swamiji himself. She attended several other lectures by Swami Vivekananda. She asked a lot of questions, and his answers dispelled her doubts and established her faith and reverence for the speaker. Nivedita wrote in 1904 to a friend about her decision to follow Swami Vivekananda as a result of her meeting him in England in November,1895: She started taking interest in the teachings of Gautama Buddha, and her discussions with Swami Vivekananda were an alternate source of peace and benediction. She wrote: Vivekananda's principles and teachings influenced her and this brought about a visible change in her. Seeing the fire and passion in her, Swami Vivekananda could foresee her future role in India. 25 March 1898, was the holiest and most unforgettable day of Nivedita's (Margaret) life. That was the day on which her guru dedicated her to God and to the service of India. Swami Vivekananda was deeply pained by the wretchedness and misery of the people of India under the British rule and his opinion was that education was the panacea for all evils plaguing the contemporary Indian society, especially that of Indian women. Margaret was chosen for the role of educating Indian women. In his letter to Margaret, Vivekananda wrote, \\"Let me tell you frankly that I am now convinced that you have a great future in the work for India. What was wanted was not a man but a woman, a real lioness, to work for the Indians, women especially.\\"Atmaprana  Travel to India  Responding to Swami Vivekananda's call, Margaret travelled to India, leaving behind her friends and family, including her mother. Mombasa, the ship bringing Margaret to India, reached Calcutta on 28 January 1898. On 22 February, Margaret visited Dakshineshwar temple, the place where Ramakrishna did his sadhana. Swami Vivekananda devoted the initial few days in teaching her about India and its people, and helping her develop the love for the people; he was broadening her character. He explained India's history, philosophy, literature, the life of the common mass, social traditions, and also the lives of great personalities, both ancient and modern, to her. A few weeks later, two of Swami Vivekananda's women disciples in America, Sara C. Bull, wife of famous Norwegian violinist and composer Ole Bull and Josephine MacLeod arrived in India. The three became lifelong friends. On 11 March 1898, Swami Vivekananda organized a public meeting at Star Theatre to introduce Sister Nivedita to the people of Calcutta. In his speech, Swami Vivekananda said ‚Äì \\"England has sent us another gift in Miss Margaret Noble.\\" In this meeting, Margaret expressed her desire to serve India and its people. On 17 March she met Sarada Devi who greeted Margaret affectionately as Khooki (i.e. little girl). = Brahmacharya = On 25 March 1898, at Nilambar Mukherjee Garden,Hironmoy N. Mukherjee (2015) Swami Vivekananda's Spiritual Daughter: Sister Nivedita. Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai. p. 19 Swami Vivekananda formally initiated Margaret in the vow of Brahmacharya (lifelong celibacy) and gave her the name of \\"Nivedita\\", the dedicated one. Swami Vivekananda said to her \\"Go thou and follow Him, Who was born and gave His life for others five hundred times before He attained the vision of the Buddha.\\" Though Sister Nivedita expressed her desire to take the ultimate vow of Sannyasa, Swami Vivekananda did not approve of it. Later, after the demise of Swami Vivekananda, on 28 July 1902, Nivedita wrote to the Editor of the Statesman the following letter: Swami Vivekananda was anxious to mold Nivedita as a Hindu Brahmacharini. He wanted her to be a Hindu in thoughts and actions. He encouraged her to visit Hindu ladies to observe their way of life.Hironmoy N. Mukherjee (2015) Swami Vivekananda's Spiritual Daughter: Sister Nivedita. Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai. p. 11 He told her:  Relationship with Sarada Devi  alt=Image of Sarada Devi and Sister Nivedita siting Within a few days of her arrival in India, on 17 March 1898, Margaret met Sarada Devi, wife and spiritual consort of Ramakrishna, who, surpassing all language and cultural barriers, embraced her as \\"khooki\\" or \\"little girl\\" in Bengali. It was St.Patrick's Day, a very holy & special day in Margaret's life, and Nivedita recounted it as her \\"day of days.\\"Adhyatmasadhika Nivedita, by Pravrajika Gyanadaprana Until her death in 1911, Nivedita remained one of the closest associates of Sarada Devi. On 13 November 1898, the Holy Mother Sarada Devi came to open Nivedita's newly founded school. After worshiping Ramakrishna she consecrated the school and blessed it, saying: ‚ÄòI pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.‚Äô Nivedita was delighted and recorded her feelings later as \\"I cannot imagine a grander omen than her blessings, spoken over the educated Hindu womanhood of the future.\\"Nivedita of India, published by Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture The first photograph of Sarada Devi was taken at Nivedita's house. Nivedita wrote in a letter to her friend Nell Hammond about Sarada Devi after her first few meetings with her, \\"She really is, under the simplest, most unassuming guise, one of the strongest and greatest of women.\\" An excerpt is provided here from the Gospel of Holy Mother, where Sarada Devi's impressions about Nivedita are captured vividly:  Travels  Nivedita travelled to many places in India, including Kashmir, with Swami Vivekananda, Josephine Mcleod, and Sara Bull. This helped her in connecting to the Indian masses, Indian culture, and its history. She also went to the United States to raise awareness and get help for her cause. On 11 May 1898, she went with Swami Vivekananda, Sara Bull, Josephine MacLeod, and Swami Turiyananda, on a journey to the Himalayas. From Nainital, they travelled to Almora. On 5 June 1898, she wrote a letter to her friend Nell Hammond exclaiming, \\"Oh Nell, Nell, India is indeed the Holy Land.\\"Letters of Sister Nivedita, Vol. I In Almora, she first learned the art of meditation. She wrote about this experience, \\"A mind must be brought to change its centre of gravity... again the open and disinterested state of mind welcomes truth.\\"Complete Works of Sister Nivedita, volume 1, edited by Sankari Prasad Basu, Nababharat publication, Kolkata, 1992 She also started learning Bengali from Swami Swarupananda. From Almora, they went to Kashmir valley where they stayed in houseboats. In the summer of 1898, Nivedita travelled to Amarnath with Swami Vivekananda. Later in 1899 she travelled to the United States with Swami Vivekananda and stayed in Ridgely Manor in upstate New York. She later recorded some of her tour and experiences with her master (guru) in the book The Master as I Saw Him and Notes on Some Wanderings with Swami Vivekananda. She often used to refer to Swami Vivekananda as \\"The King\\" and considered herself as his spiritual daughter (Manaskanya in Bengali).Letters of Sister Nivedita  Swami Vivekananda's death  Sister Nivedita saw Swami Vivekananda for the last time on 2 July 1902 at Belur Math.Linda Prugh (1999) Josephine MacLeod and Vivekananda's Mission, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai. p.290 Vivekananda was observing the Ekadashi fasting on that day. However, when his disciples took their meal, he himself served them joyfully. After the meal, Vivekananda poured water over Nivedita's hands, and dried them with a towel. Nivedita recorded it in The Master As I Saw Him in the following words: Swami Vivekananda died at 9:10 p.m. on 4 July 1902. On that night, Nivedita dreamed Sri Ramakrishna was leaving his body a second time.Atmaprana, p. 139 On the next morning, Swami Saradananda from Belur Math sent a monk with a letter to Sister Nivedita and conveying the message of Vivekananda's death. Instantly everything around Nivedita's eyes became blank. She immediately rushed to the Math and reached the place around 7a.m. and entered the room of Vivekananda. There she found Swamiji's body was laid on the floor. She sat near Vivekananda's head and fanned his body with a hand fan until his body was taken down at 2p.m. to the porch leading to the courtyard. In the afternoon of 5 July, Swami Vivekananda's body was taken for cremation. Vivekananda's body was wrapped in a saffron cloth. Nivedita wished to take a small portion of that cloth so that she could send it as a memento to Josephine MacLeod. Understanding the mind of Nivedita Swami Saradananda asked her to cut a small portion of the Swami's cloth. But, Nivedita was unsure whether the act would be proper or not and decided not to take it. When Vivekananda's body was being cremated she sat all the while looking at the burning pyre. Around six o'clock in the evening, the burning flame was about to go out. Suddenly Nivedita felt somebody had pulled her sleeve. She turned around and found a small piece of saffron cloth which had somehow come out of the pyre during cremation. Nivedita lifted and took the cloth considering it as a message from the Swami. In her letter to Josephine MacLeod on 14 September 1902, Nivedita wrote:  Works of Sister Nivedita  Sister Nivedita, reading a book = Girls' school in Bagbazar = Nivedita was planning to open a school for girls who were deprived of even basic education. She toured England and America on a lecture tour designed to raise monies to establish a girls school. The main reason why Swamiji invited Nivedita to India was to spread education to the women of the country. This is why, when Nivedita informed Vivekananda about her planning, he felt very excited. He organized a meeting at Balaram Bose's house on this issue. Many lay devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, including Mahendranath Gupta ( popularly known as Sri M., the chronicler of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna), Suresh Dutta, Haramohan etc. attended this meeting. In this meeting, Nivedita explained her plan of the proposed school and requested everyone to send their girls to the school to study. During her speech, Vivekananda entered the room and took a seat behind everyone. Nivedita did not notice it. But, when Nivedita appealed to collect girl students for the school, she suddenly discovered Vivekananda in the room pushing others and prompting ‚Äì \\"Ye, get up, get up! It‚Äôs not good enough to just become girls‚Äô fathers. All of you must cooperate in the matter of their education as per national ideals. Stand up and commit. Reply to her appeal. Say, 'We all agree. We shall send our girls to you.'\\" But no one stood up to support Nivedita's proposal. Finally, Vivekananda forced Haramohan to agree to the proposal and behalf of Haramohan Vivekananda promised to send her girls to the school. A memorial plaque in the house of Bagbazar where Sister Nivedita started her school On 13 November 1898, on the day of Kali Puja, at 16 Bosepara Lane in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta, she started the school. The school was inaugurated by Sarada Devi, in the presence of Swami Vivekananda and some of the other disciples of Ramakrishna. Sarada Devi blessed and prayed for the school saying ‚Äì \\"I pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.\\" Nivedita went from home to home in educating girls, many of whom were in pitiable condition owing to the socio-economic condition of early 20th century India. In many cases, she encountered refusal from the male members of the girl's family. Nivedita had widows and adult women among her students. She taught sewing, elementary rules of hygiene, nursing, etc., apart from regular courses. Collecting money for the school was not an easy task. She had to earn money from her writings and giving lectures and later she spent all to meet the expenses of the school. She took part in altruistic activities. She worked to improve the lives of Indian women of all castes. = Work during plague epidemic = During the outbreak of a plague epidemic in Calcutta in 1899, Nivedita nursed and took care of the patients, cleaned rubbish from the area, and inspired and motivated many youths to render voluntary service. She inserted appeals for help in the English newspapers and requested for financial support for her plague relief activities. She also organized the day-to-day activities, inspected the work and personally handed over the written instructions for the preventive measures by moving around. She was a friend to many intellectuals and artists in the Bengali community, including Rabindranath Tagore, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Abala Bose, and Abanindranath Tagore. Later she took up the cause of Indian independence. Sri Aurobindo was one of her friends as well. = Cultivation of Indian culture = She took an active interest in promoting Indian history, culture, and science. She actively encouraged Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Indian scientist and philosopher to pursue original scientific research and helped him financially as well in getting due recognition when he was faced with an indifferent attitude of the British Government. Bose, whom she called \\"khoka\\" or the \\"little one\\" in Bengali, and his wife Abala Bose, were in very close terms with her. Keeping in view Nivedita's contribution to the scientific research work of Jagadish Chandra, Rabindranath Tagore said: \\"In the day of his success, Jagadish gained an invaluable energizer and helper in Sister Nivedita, and in any record of his life‚Äôs work her name must be given a place of honour.\\" Her identity as both a westerner by birth and a disciple of Swami Vivekananda enabled her to do several things that might have been difficult for Indians. For example, she promoted pan-Indian nationalism. = Contribution towards Indian nationalism = Nivedita was a prolific writer and extensively toured India to deliver lectures, especially on India's culture and religion. She appealed to the Indian youth to work selflessly for the cause of the motherland along the ideals of Swami Vivekananda. Initially, Nivedita, like contemporary intellectuals from Europe, was optimistic about British rule in India and believed that it was possible for India and England to love each other. However, in the course of her stay, she came to witness the brutal side of the British rule, the repression and oppression and the division between the ruling elite and the ruled; she concluded that it was necessary for India to gain independence to prosper. Therefore, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to the cause of opposing the British rule. In February 1902, Mahatma Gandhi, or Mr.M.K.Gandhi as he was known then, visited Nivedita in Calcutta.The Life of Swami Vivekananda, 7th ed., Advaita Ashrama, Kolkata, 2011, Vol.II, p. 615. After Vivekananda's death, being acutely aware of the inconvenience of the newly formed Ramakrishna Mission on account of her political activities, she publicly dissociated herself from it. However, until her last days, she had a very cordial relationship with the brother disciples of Swami Vivekananda like Swami Brahmananda, Baburam Maharaj (Swami Premananda) and Swami Saradananda, who helped her in her charitable and educational activities in every possible way; she was very close to the holy mother, Sarada Devi. Nivedita had initially worked with Okakura of Japan and Sarala Ghoshal who was related to the Tagore family. She later started working on her own and maintained a direct relationship with many of the young revolutionaries of Bengal, including those of Anushilan Samity, a secret organization. She inspired many youths in taking up the cause of freeing India through her lectures. She also exposed Lord Curzon after his speech at the University of Calcutta in 1905 where he mentioned that truth was given a higher place in the moral codes of the West, than in East. She undertook her own research and made it public that in the book Problems of The Far East by Curzon she had proudly described how he had given false statements about his age and marriage to the president of the Korean Foreign Office to win his favour. This statement when published in newspapers like Amrita Bazar Patrika and The Statesman caused a furore and forced Curzon to apologize. In 1905 the British Government under Curzon initiated the partition of Bengal which was a major turning point in the Indian independence movement. Nivedita played a pioneering role in organizing the movement. She provided financial and logistical support and leveraged her contacts to get information from government agencies and forewarn the revolutionaries. She met Indian artists like Abanindranath Tagore, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Havell and inspired them to develop pure Indian school of art. She always inspired and guided the talented students of the Calcutta Art School to move along the forgotten tracks of ancient Indian art like Nandalal Bose, Asit Kumar Haldar and Surendranath Gangopadhyay. She exerted great influence on famous Tamil poet, Subrahmanya Bharati, who met her only briefly in 1906. She influenced Bharathi to work for the freedom of women in the country, which he did all through his life Nivedita designed the national flag of India with the thunderbolt as the emblem against a red background. Nivedita tried her utmost to inculcate the nationalist spirit in the minds of her students through all their daily activities. She introduced singing of the song Vande M√†taram in her school as a prayer. Nivedita provided guarded support to Annie Besant and was very close to Aurobindo Ghosh (later Sri Aurobindo), one of the major contributors towards the early nationalist movement. She edited Karma Yogin, the nationalist newspaper of Aurobindo. The following piece is from an editorial in Karma Yogin, written by Nivedita, which depicts her intense respect for India: Manuscript of \\"Blessings to Nivedita\\" a poem written by Swami Vivekananda in his own handwriting  Death  Nivedita died on 13 October 1911, aged 43, at Roy Villa, Darjeeling. Today, her memorial is located below the Railway station on the way to the Victoria Falls (of Darjeeling) with these words inscribed in her epitaph ‚Äì \\"Here lies Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India\\". Swami Vivekananda wrote a poem to Sister Nivedita, A benediction to Sister Nivedita. In this poem, Vivekananda condensed all his hopes, aspirations, and good wishes for his disciple,Sister Nivedita, 118 Nivedita as The mistress, servant, friend in one to India's future son‚Äì > The mother's heart, the hero's will The sweetness of the southern breeze, > The sacred charm and strength that dwell On Aryan altars, flaming, free; All > these be yours and many more No ancient soul could dream before- Be thou to > India's future son The mistress, servant, friend in one.  Influence  Sister Nivedita on a 1968 stamp of India Sister Nivedita remains one of the most influential female figures of India. Her book Kali, the Mother influenced Abanindranath Tagore who painted Bharat Mata. In 2010, the office of the board of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Salt Lake City, Kolkata was named after Sister Nivedita. The Sister Nivedita Academy, an institution dedicated to her memory has been established in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Several schools and colleges have been named after her. In 1968, the Indian Government issued a postal stamp in her memory. The Nivedita bridge near Dakhineswer, Kolkata is named in her honour. In 2015, a new Government Degree College at Hastings House, Alipur, Kolkata was named after Sister Nivedita. Sister Nivedita was one of the important influences on Jagadish Chandra Bose. She supported him by organizing the financial support and editing his manuscripts, she made sure that Bose was able to continue with and share his work.

Though there were some biographies in English and Bengali before this, they lack in historical facts. The historical account of Sister Nivedita's life in Bengali was written by Pravrajika Muktiprana of Sri Sarada Math and was published in 1959. The materials for the biographies were sourced from Sister Nivedita's own works, letters and diaries, references made to her by some of her contemporaries, and interviews with those who had worked with her and her own students. Later, in 1961, the English version of the book written by Pravrajika Atmaprana was published as Sister Nivedita of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda. Since then, the books had seen several revisions. Letters of Sister Nivedita were first published in two volumes in 1960. There were more than 800 letters, half of which were written to Miss Josephine MacLeod. These letters vibrant with her thoughts and feelings cast a lot of light on the versatile genius of Nivedita. In 1975, Barbara Fox published in London a biography of Sister Nivedita titled Long Journey Home. This work attempt to gauge Nivedita's work from an English woman's point of view. Nivedita Lokmata in Bengali was published in three volumes by Sankari Prasad Basu in 1968, 1987, and 1988 respectively.

(1854-1858 reservation shown in orange outline. 1858-present reservation shown in dark red.) Original core Fond du Lac Band area before relocation to the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation shown in green. The Fond du Lac Indian Reservation (or Nah-Gah-Chi-Wa-Nong (Nagaajiwanaang in the Double Vowel orthography), meaning \\"Where the current is blocked\\" in the Ojibwe language) is an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota near Cloquet in Carlton and Saint Louis counties. Off-reservation holdings are located across the state in Douglas County, in the northwest corner of Wisconsin. The total land area of these tribal lands is . It is the land-base for the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. Before the establishment of this reservation, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa were located at the head of Lake Superior, closer to the mouth of the Saint Louis River, where Duluth has developed. History The tribe ceded land to the US as part of an 1837 treaty along with other Ojibwa bands; the lands were located mainly from east-central Minnesota to north-central Wisconsin. Later, as part of the Treaty of La Pointe in 1842, the Fond du Lac Band and other Ojibwa tribes ceded large tracts of land located mainly in the Lake Superior watershed in Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As part of an 1854 treaty, the tribe and the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa (largely situated along the northern shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota) ceded more land to the US. Under this 1854 treaty, the US established the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation farther up the Saint Louis River, at its present location. The original Nagaajiwanaang Reservation was 1.25 times the current size. In treaty discussions the US representatives were recorded as promising the inclusion of the Perch and Big lakes, but these were excluded from the original reservation. Its boundaries extended westward to the western boundaries of the 1854 Ceded Territory. Upon appeal by the tribe, the US extended the reservation boundaries southward to include the two said lakes, but as a concession, the tribe had to agree to a reduction in the western boundaries, which were placed at the current location. It also established a reservation for the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa. Government The FDL adopted a written constitution with an elected government. Its tribal council has x members, who serve staggered terms. The FDL operates social services, tribal housing, a tribal police force, a natural resource building, a gas station, three community centers, and a private health clinic and pharmacy called Min No Aya Win Health Center. The tribe also operates two satellite health clinics, one in Duluth, named The Center for American Indian Resources (CAIR), and another in Minneapolis, the Mashkiki Waakaaigan Pharmacy (Medicine House). It has numerous members who live in these urban areas. Economy The tribe owns two casinos: Black Bear Casino in Carlton, Minnesota and Fond du Luth Casino in Duluth.

Their land base is the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation (Ojibwe language: Nagaajiwanaang), located mainly in Carlton and Saint Louis Counties, Minnesota, 20 miles west of Duluth. The Fond du Lac Ojibwe are one of six bands who comprise the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which was organized in 1934 with a new constitution under the Indian Reorganization Act.

Retrieved 22 Dec 2011. Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is one of six members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe (MCT), from which it receives certain administrative services and support. The tribal government issues its own license plates. In the 2000 United States Census, the reservation recorded a population of 3,728 people and in July, 2007, MCT reported 4,044 people enrolled through Fond du Lac. The largest community on the reservation is the city of Cloquet, of which only the sparsely populated western half of the city is on reservation land. That part has a population of 1,204 persons out of the city's total of 11,201. The only community completely on the reservation is Brookston, at the reservation's northern end. The Band operates two casinos, the Fond du Luth Casino in Duluth and the Black Bear Casino Resort on the reservation. An agreement signed with the City of Duluth, in which property with-in city limits was given to the tribe to build the Fond du Luth Casino in return for profit sharing $6 million, approximately 20%, from slot machine gross revenue, was agreed upon in 1994. Profits are no longer shared with the city due to violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This decision has been widely controversial, but each battle in court has seen the Band prevailing. On August 31, 2018, the Band reached an agreement to let Enbridge build its Line 3 replacement pipeline across the Reservation. The agreement extended Enbridge's rights of way on the Reservation by 10 years, to 2039. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Government The revised Constitution and By- Laws of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe were approved by the Secretary of Interior on March 3, 1964. The governing body of the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation is the Reservation Business Committee, which is composed of a Chairman, Secretary-Treasurer, and three Representatives: one from District I (Cloquet), one from District II (Sawyer) and one from District III (Brookston).

Giovanni Giocondo, Order of Friars Minor, (c. 1433 - 1515) was an Italian friar, architect, antiquary, archaeologist, and classical scholar. Biography Giovanni Giocondo was born in Verona around 1433. He joined the Dominican Order at the age of eighteen and was one of the many of that Order who promulgated the Renaissance. Afterwards, however, he left the Dominicans and entered the Franciscan Order. Giocondo began his career as a teacher of Latin and Greek in Verona, where Julius Caesar Scaliger was one of his pupils. As a young priest, Friar Giovanni was a learned archaeologist and a superb draughtsman. He visited Rome, sketched its ancient buildings, wrote the story of its great monuments, and recorded, deciphered and explained many defaced inscriptions. He stimulated the revival of classical learning by making transcriptions of ancient manuscripts, one of which, completed in 1492, he presented to Lorenzo de' Medici. Giocondo soon returned to his native town where he built bridges and planned fortifications for Treviso, acting as architect engineer, and head-builder during the construction. Architectural works In Verona, Giocondo designed the for Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. It is considered one of the finest buildings in Verona and is famed for the decorations of its loggia. Thomas de Quincey also attributes the church of Santa Maria della Scala to Giocondo. He was then summoned to Venice, along with a number of other well-known architects, to discuss the protection of the lagoons against the rivers. Giocondo's plan of altering the Brenta's bed and leading this river to the sea was accepted by the Venetians, and the undertaking was a complete success. Between 1496 and 1499 Giocondo was invited to France by Louis XII, and made royal adviser. There he built one bridge of remarkable beauty, the Pont Notre-Dame (1500-1512) in Paris, and designed the Palace of the Chambre des Comptes, the Golden Room of the Parliament, and the Chateau of Gaillon (Normandy), one portal of which has been removed to Paris, and stood for years in the courtyard of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts to serve as a model for students of architecture, and was returned in 1977. Between 1506 and 1508 Giocondo returned to Italy and constructed the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (1508), which was decorated by Titian and Giorgione. In 1513 the Rialto Bridge and its environs were burned. Giocondo was one of those who presented plans for a new bridge and surrounding structures. The designs of a rival were chosen. Giocondo left Venice for Rome where he was employed by the Vatican from 1514. In a letter to Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, in 1513, Giocondo referred to himself \\"an old man\\". On Donato Bramante's death he was made part of a team with Raphael and Giuliano da Sangallo to superintend the erection of the new St. Peter's Basilica. The work included strengthening the foundations. He died in 1515, while involved with this project.  Published works  In 1498 Giocondo published Pliny's Epistles in Bologna. He published another edition with Aldus Manutius's press (1508), which he dedicated to King Louis XII. Between 1506 and 1508 Giocondo wrote four dissertations on the waters and waterways of Venice. Giocondo was among the first to produce a corrected edition of De architectura by the classical Roman writer Vitruvius, a treatise that had a major influence on the development of Renaissance architecture. It was an illustrated edition, printed in Venice in 1511, and dedicated to Pope Julius II. Giocondo also published the works of Julius Obsequens, Aurelius Victor, and Cato the Elder's De re rustica. He also edited Julius Caesar's Commentaries and made the first drawing of Caesar's bridge across the Rhine. In addition to his classical and mathematical knowledge, he was a master of scholastic theology. Giocondo is sometimes identified as the author of the widely quoted inspirational letter, A Letter to the Most Illustrious the Contessina Allagia degli Aldobrandeschi, Written Christmas Eve Anno Domini 1513. The British Museum, however, stated in 1970 that the authorship of the letter was uncertain.\\"Fra Giovanni Letter\\" in Bartleby.com.

Initially, the chassis of the Type 61 tank would be used. Later, it had been rejected and had the chassis of the Type 74 tank used instead as a basis for producing the Type 87 SPAAG. Prior to its development, tests had begun underway in 1982 with a prototype SPAAG unit manufactured in 1983. A Type 87 prototype at the JGSDF public information center. Status In 2010, it was reported that the Japan Self-Defense Forces had 52 of these vehicles in service.

Once a common forest bird, its numbers declined drastically after the introduction of rats and stoats, and it is now endangered.  Name  The yellowhead was known in the 19th century as the \\"bush canary\\", after its trilling song. Today it often goes by its MƒÅori name m≈çhua in New Zealand English, but MƒÅori also knew it as m≈çhoua and houa. Recent classification places this species and its close relative, the whitehead, in the family Mohouidae.  Distribution  The yellowhead and the whitehead have allopatric distributions as, conversely, the latter is found only in the North Island and several small islands surrounding it. Although abundant in the 19th century, particularly in southern beech forests on the South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura, m≈çhua declined dramatically in the early 20th century due to the introduction of black rats and mustelids; nesting in tree holes makes them more vulnerable to predators. Today they have vanished from almost all the South Island's forests, and exist in less than 5% of their original range. On the mainland South Island there is currently a small population of m≈çhua in the Marlborough Sounds and around Arthur's Pass, but a quarter of the population lives in the beech forests of the Catlins. The total number of m≈çhua is about 5000. Conservation In New Zealand, m≈çhua have the status of a protected threatened endemic species. Conservation efforts are being made to ensure its survival and m≈çhua populations have been established on several predator-free offshore islands, such as Breaksea Island in Fiordland and Ulva Island. Birds have been captive- bred at Orana Park in Christchurch. In 2003, 39 m≈çhua were translocated from Breaksea Island to predaror-free Whenua H≈çu / Codfish Island, and more were introduced to Whenua H≈çu from the Catlins in 2018, increasing the island's population to about 1000. More releases are planned to islands in Fiordland. M≈çhua on predator-free Ulva Island Pest control efforts by the Department of Conservation have managed to stabilise some mainland m≈çhua populations. For example, where biodegradable 1080 poison was used to control rats in the Dart valley, there was a more than 80% survival rate, compared with just 10% in untreated areas.Making mohua safe at Lake Wakatipu The population of m≈çhua in the Landsborough valley has increased four-fold since 1998, thanks to an intensive programme of pest control, including aerial 1080. The population is now strong enough for birds to be transferred out to establish a new population on Resolution Island. Similar aerial 1080 operations in the CatlinsTVNZ: 1080 poison pays off for endangered NZ bird and the Hurunui,Department of Conservation Hawdon and Eglinton valleys1080: The Facts: 1080 helping mohua have had equally encouraging results. DOC and TBfree New Zealand accounted in March 2014 a significant repopulation in the Catlins of other avian species, including bellbird and tomtit, due to the reduction in predators.  Popular culture  Since the redesign of New Zealand's currency in 1991 a yellowhead has appeared on the reverse side of the New Zealand $100 note.

Its creation was groundbreaking in that it was the first time a leading university had combined all three (theater, film and television) of these aspects into a single administration. The undergraduate program is often ranked among the world's top drama departments. The graduate programs are usually ranking within the top three nationally, according to the U.S. News & World Report. Among the school's resources are the Geffen Playhouse and the UCLA Film & Television Archive, the world's largest university-based archive of its kind, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2015. The Archive constitutes one of the largest collections of media materials in the United States ‚Äî second only to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Its vaults hold more than 220,000 motion picture and television titles and 27 million feet of newsreel footage. The film, television, and digital media program is one of the most prestigious film programs in the world. It is the most selective film school as the film and television major selects about only 15 freshman out of thousands of applicants and a handful of transfer students. The School's enrollment, in 2014, consisted of 631 students. For Fall 2014, the School received 4,442 applications and offered admission to 346 applicants (7.8%). With 140 faculty members teaching 335 undergrads and 296 graduate students, the teacher to student ratio is about 1:5. History The roots of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television go back to 1947 when the Theater Arts Department was created at UCLA and chaired by German theater director William Melnitz. When the department became the UCLA College of Fine Arts in 1961, Melnitz was named the founding dean, and drama critic and film producer Kenneth Macgowan became the chair of the Department of Theater Arts. The College of Fine Arts grew in standing and within seven years, its two departments had moved into their own facilities: Macgowan Hall became home to Theater in 1963, and the Department of Motion Pictures, Television and Radio moved into Melnitz Hall in 1967. Melnitz Hall is one of the few film theaters in the country with the capability of projecting nitrate base motion pictures. Nitrate films were the standard of pre-talkie motion pictures. Twenty years later, in 1987, The College of Fine Arts was disbanded. The School of Theater, Film and Television was created in 1990, and Gilbert Cates, a renowned film, television and Broadway director, became its founding dean. The curriculum was expanded, new faculty was hired, and entertainment industry connections were strengthened. In 1999, Robert Rosen became UCLA TFT‚Äôs second dean. A professor and film historian, Rosen had earlier spearheaded the expansion of the UCLA Film & Television Archive into one of the largest collections of moving image material. As dean, Rosen expanded the School‚Äôs international influence with strong alliances, particularly in China. UCLA alumna Teri Schwartz became the dean of UCLA TFT in 2009. A former award-winning feature film producer, she was previously the founding dean of the School of Film and Television at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. In January 2020, established and award-winning theater director Brian Kite became the interim dean of TFT. Kite is the recipient of the 2018 Joel Hirschhorn Award from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle, for distinguished achievement in musical theater. He is a Los Angeles Ovation Award winner for Best Direction of a Musical for his production of Spring Awakening and was again nominated for his productions of Les Mis√©rables and American Idiot. Kite is a chair emeritus of the Board of Governors of the L.A. Stage Alliance, holds an appointment as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Theatre Academy and is the artistic director of the award-winning Buffalo Nights Theatre Company. The Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment The Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment at UCLA TFT was created in partnership with Participant Media founder and CEO Jeffrey Skoll in 2014. Skoll donated $10 million for the center, the first of its kind dedicated solely to advancing entertainment and performing arts to inspire social change. The idea for the center came to Teri Schwartz, later dean of the UCLA TFT, in 2003; after meeting Skoll in 2007, she shared the idea for the center with him, and seven years later the center was founded. The work of the Center is organized around three pillars: research, education and special initiatives, and public programming and exhibition. The Skoll Center for SIE is one of about a dozen dedicated research institutions focusing on Social impact entertainment. Department of Theater The different areas of studies in the Department of Theater consist of: *Acting *Design for Theater and Entertainment *Directing *Musical Theater *Playwriting *Theater and Performance Studies =Undergraduate program= The undergraduate program requires an interview/audition process for all applicants. The program teaches the general studies of theater broadly, before allowing the student to study their specified area of study. =Graduate program= Offering Master of Fine Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees, the graduate program requires an audition for all acting applicants and a possible interview for other candidates. Each applicant must apply for a specific area of study. Department of Film, Television and Digital Media The different areas of studies in the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media consist of: *Critical Studies: The history, theory and aesthetics of film and television *Film and television production (study and field): Digital, experimental and animation *Film and television writing, film directing, television directing, cinematography, sound recording and editing =Undergraduate program= The undergraduate program in Film, Television and Digital Media gives students the opportunity to learn about the history and theory of film and television while also teaching practical, creative and technical skills. Students must concentrate on one of the following areas: *Film production (Directing) *Producing *Documentary *Screenwriting *Animation *Digital Media *Critical Studies *Cinematography Students must all complete one internship during their senior year. =Graduate program= Offering Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees, the graduate program offers two main areas of study. A Master of Arts and a Doctor of Philosophy degree are available for Cinema and Media Studies. The Master of Fine Arts degree can be obtained with the choice of five specializations: *Animation *Cinematography *Producers Program *Production/Directing *Screenwriting =Professional Programs= The School also offers non-degree certificate programs modeled after the MFA curriculum. The UCLA Professional Programs in Screenwriting, Video Game Writing, Producing and Acting for the Camera are the only non- degree screenwriting and producing programs that have oversight by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, and the only viable alternatives to the UCLA MFA Screenwriting and Producing programs. In the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting (offered both on-campus and online), students focus on the theory and craft of professional screenwriting, without having to take the critical studies seminars and related electives that are required to obtain a degree. The goal of this graduate-level program, which takes place over one academic year, is for the student to start and complete two original feature-length screenplays. The UCLA Professional Program in Producing is a 10-week program that provides an intensive overview of the contemporary film and television industries and introduces students to the tools needed to navigate the studio and independent marketplace. The program consists of a series of lectures, discussions, and appearances by entertainment industry guests. Facilities The School of Theater, Film and Television consists of a linked network of professional theaters, sound stages, and television studios. =The Billy Wilder Theater at the Hammer Museum = Hammer Museum on Wilshire and Westwood Blvds.

The name combi comes from the word combination, and is derived from the famous Volkswagen Type 2 van, often called the \\"Kombi\\" van, specifically the Kombinationskraftwagen (combination motor vehicle) variant, with side windows and removable rear seats, which both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined. Combi aircraft typically feature an oversized cargo door, as well as tracks on the cabin floor to allow the seats to be added or removed quickly. Typically, configured for both passenger and cargo duty, the passenger compartment is pressurized to a higher pressure, to prevent potential fumes from cargo entering the passenger area.  Airlines  =Northwest Airlines= One U.S. air carrier that flew propeller-driven combi aircraft was Northwest Airlines. In 1963, Northwest was operating a domestic and International routing with a Douglas DC-7C four engine propeller aircraft between New York Idlewild Airport (which would subsequently be renamed JFK Airport) and Tokyo that was configured to transport a mixed passenger/cargo load. The round trip routing for this flight which was operated once a week was New York-Chicago-Seattle-Anchorage-Tokyo. The DC-7C was configured with all economy seating in the passenger cabin.http://www.timetableimages.com; Northwest Airlines March 1, 1963 system timetable, pages 8 & 14 By 1966, Northwest was operating jet combi service with Boeing 707-320C aircraft between the U.S. and Asia.http://www.timetableimages.com, March 1, 1966 Northwest Airlines system timetable =Braniff International= Another U.S. airline that operated combi aircraft was Braniff International.

He is more frequently known as Magor, which can be roughly translated as \\"shithead\\",Zantovsky 2014, p161 \\"loony\\", or \\"fool\\" (though meant as a positive title), a nickname given to him by the experimental poet . Trained as an art historian but unable to work in this field in Czechoslovakia under the Communist regime, Jirous became a member of the dissident subculture, and during the period of normalisation, Jirous was imprisoned five times for his activities. His particular contribution to the dissident movement was the concept of \\"second culture\\", according to which simply expressing oneself through forbidden cultural and artistic activities would ultimately undermine the totalitarian system,Zantovsky 2014, p.202 a concept closely related to his friend V√°clav Havel's \\"living in truth\\", and V√°clav Benda's \\"parallel polis\\". Jirous won the Jaroslav Seifert Prize in 2006 and the Tom Stoppard Prize in 1985 for the poem Magor's Swan Song ().  Early life  Jirous was born in Humpolec in Vysoƒçina. His mother was a teacher, and his father worked in tax. He completed his secondary education at Dr. A Hrdliƒçka's Secondary Comprehensive and Primary School in Humpolec (now known as Dr A Hrdliƒçka's Gymnasium). Initially, Jirous wanted to study at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), but his cousin Ji≈ô√≠ Padrta, editor of the journal V√Ωtvarn√° pr√°ce, steered him towards art history. In 1962, Jirous sat the entrance exam to study history of art at the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University in Prague. A condition of entry for students at the time was the completion of a year in industry before beginning their studies; in Jirous' case, he had to work as a construction worker and stoker. Jirous studied between 1963 and 1968. The topic of his diploma thesis was visual poetry in the works of the poets Ji≈ô√≠ Kol√°≈ô and Henri Michaux. His sister Zara, who was two years older than him and married to the photographer , also pursued fine art.  Underground activities  In 1967, Jirous became familiar with the underground group The Primitives Group, and later in 1969 became the artistic director and manager of The Plastic People of the Universe (PPU). His wife, Vƒõra Jirousov√°, wrote a lot of the band's early lyrics. Due to his opposition to his country's totalitarian regime, Jirous was prohibited from publishing his literature. Instead, he had to work as a night watchman and gardener to avoid being unemployed, which was a punishable offence. Jirous was imprisoned five times for his underground organisation and artistic activities. He was often cautioned under paragraph 202 - \\"disturbing the peace\\". Jirous was first imprisoned between 1973 and 1974 for an incident in a pub with a retired Security Service Major. Jirous was convicted alongside Eugen Brikcius, Dan√≠ƒçek and Jaroslav Ko≈ô√°n. After singing the song \\"Send the Russian killers to hell where they belong\\" and exchanging words with the Major, Jirous ate the middle of the newspaper Rud√© pr√°vo and exclaimed \\"Today I ate Rud√© pr√°vo, just like one day we will gobble up the Bolsheviks\\". In June 2011, his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court. Jirous's most influential work was Notes on the Third Czech Musical Revival, which he published in exile in 1975. The work was considered a policy statement for the non-political Czech underground and included: # Radical rejection of any form of coercion; # The renunciation of any imposed artistic programme; # Emphasise authenticity in life and artistic creation; # Determination against totalitarian structures. According to Jirous, \\"the aim of the underground is to create an alternative culture. A culture which will be independent of official communication channels, social evaluation, and the hierarchy of values as imposed by the establishment. A culture which cannot aim to destroy the establishment, for that will only play into the establishment's hands.\\"JIROUS, Ivan. Zpr√°va o t≈ôet√≠m ƒçesk√©m hudebn√≠m obrozen√≠ in Magor≈Øv z√°pisn√≠k. Praha: Torst, 1997. . S. 197 Jirous compiled an anthology of underground poetry entitled Egon Bondy to the 45th birthday of the disabled siblings. He also organised several \\"festivals of independent culture\\"; the first took place in Postupice in September 1974, forcefully broken up by police, followed by another in Bojanovice in 1976, which also served as a belated celebration of Jirous' marriage to his second wife Juliana. In early 1976 Jirous was introduced to V√°clav Havel for the first time, via a mutual friend, Franti≈°ek Smejkal.Zantovsky 2014, p162 The two men became friends and allies, and Jirous is mentioned several times in Havel's Letters to Olga. On 16 March 1976, Jirous was arrested again, along with the PPU and many other musicians. The whole trial was widely publicised by the regime as a deterrent against troublemakers and hooligans; Czechoslovak Television released a documentary about them called An attack on culture, and an episode of television series Thirty Cases of Major Zeman, entitled Mimicry and starring Ji≈ô√≠ L√°bus, portrayed the group as drug addicts and terrorists. The trial took place on 21‚Äì23 September 1976, and Jirous was convicted for \\"aggravated hooliganism\\", along with the musician and pastor Svatopluk Kar√°sek, Pavel Zaj√≠ƒçek of the group DG 307, and Vratislav Brabenec from PPU, and imprisoned for a second time, for 18 months.Zantovsky 2014, p165 The trial became a cause c√©l√®bre, and organised opposition to the charges brought together for the first time the originally apolitical underground groups and political dissidents led by Havel, which eventually led to the creation of Charter 77. On his release from prison in 1977, Jirous signed the Charter, and also organised a third \\"festival of independent culture\\", at V√°clav Havel's country house at Hr√°deƒçek in Trutnov District. Future concerts could only be held as private events since public performances by PPU had been banned. A month after returning home, Jirous was again sentenced to time in prison after he made a speech at a exhibition about the insuperable distinction between official and unofficial culture. He served this sentence between 1977 and 1978. In 1979 he helped create the samizdat Vokno, and wrote the unfinished work The True Story of the Plastic People. He also became a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). Jirous's fourth spell in prison was due to his role in producing, publishing and distributing the magazine Vokno, along with , Michal H√Ωbek, Milan Friƒç, and Jaroslav Chn√°pek. The trial took place in May 1982 with strict security and attended by specially selected people, loyal to the regime. The judgement deemed that articles from Vokno were antisocial, with grossly indecent subject matter and a disrespect for society. Between 1981 and 1985, Jirous was again imprisoned, officially for disturbing the peace, but also, according to Amnesty International and VONS, for unsubstantiated charges of illegal possession of marijuana, allegedly found during a house search. In 1984, Jirous was named Prisoner of the Month by Amnesty International. It was during this time that he wrote the poems later collected as Magor's Swan Song (), for which he later won the Tom Stoppard Award. Between 1985 and 1987, Jirous was under supervision as part of his previous convictions, and had to report daily to the Public Security Office. His fifth imprisonment was in response to his signature on the petition \\"Tak dost\\", created in response to the death of the dissident Pavel Wonka. Jirous was imprisoned for \\"an attack on the state and social organisation\\" together with Jiri Tichy, and was in prison from 1988 until 25 November 1989, when the President of the Republic waived the rest of his sentence.  After 1989  After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Jirous became a member of the Czech PEN club. He and wrote to the Interior Ministry in protest against the police intervention at CzechTek 2004. Until his death, Jirous lived in Prague and in a converted farmhouse in Vysoƒçina, where the Magorovo Vyd≈ô√≠ music festival took place every year from the revolution until 2005. Since 2006 it has been held at Skal√°kovy ml√Ωn. Although his friend Jaroslav Eri Fric described him as \\"a devotee of purity, tenderness and justice\\", Jirous was vulgar and confrontational, often intentionally, and sometimes physically aggressive when drunk. Jirous died suddenly on 9 November 2011. His memorial service took place on 17 November 2011 in the Church of Saint Ignatius in Prague, with the service conducted by Bishop V√°clav Mal√Ω. He was buried in a local cemetery to his home in Vysoƒçina.  Personal life  Jirous's first wife was Vƒõra Va≈ôilov√° (1944‚Äì2011), a poet and art historian. In 1972 their son was born, Tobi√°≈°, now an actor, writer and DJ. Jirous is named as Tobias's father on his birth certificate, but Tobias's biological father is in fact the philosopher Ji≈ô√≠ Nƒõmec. In 1976, Jirous married for a second time, to the painter Juli√°na Stritzkov√° (born 1943), the granddaughter of Josef Florian. Jirous and Juli√°na had two daughters, Franti≈°ka (1980) and Marta (1981). Jirous spent a large proportion of his daughters' childhoods in prison, but remained in contact with his family. The marriage broke down shortly after his release. His daughter Franti≈°ka is a novelist, and the chair of the organisation Magor's Estate, which aims to transform Jirous's estate in Vysoƒçina into a monument to poets. Marta continued her father's poetry in the collection Walk with an Angel. Jirous also had a son, Daniel (born 1992), with translator Daniela Degtƒõvov√°. Daniel studies architecture and lives in Prague. Jirous was in a relationship with the songwriter, D√°≈°a Vokat√°, from the 1990s until his death in 2011.  Works  Ivan Martin Jirous first started publishing art criticism during the 1960s. At first, he focused on foreign modern art (Russian avant-garde, Lucio Fontana, Andy Warhol), then later examined the relationship between beat music and art, and later, he specialised in the K≈ôi≈æovnick√° school of clean humour without the joke (Nadƒõ≈æda Pl√≠≈°kov√°, Karel Nepra≈° and Jan Stekl√≠k). Jirous was also interested in older art, such as the sculptures of V√°clav Lev√Ω. Jirous contributed to journals including Ateli√©r, Divadlo (\\"Theatre\\"), Host do domu (\\"Guesthouse\\"), Se≈°ity pro literaturu a diskusi (\\"Notebooks for literature and discussion\\"), V√Ωtvarn√° pr√°ce (\\"Visual works\\"), V√Ωtvarn√© umƒõn√≠ (\\"Fine art\\"), V√Ωtvarn√Ω ≈æivot (\\"Visual life\\"), to the international periodicals Art Canada and Exile Testimony, as well as the samizdat publication Vokno. = Features of Magor's poetry = Macaronic language, paraphrasing * Expression * Imperfect rhymes * Assonance * Acrostic * Sarcasm and irony * Vulgarism and Catholic elements * Self-expression, existential depth * Search for self and God * Spirituality * Addressing specific people, referring to other authors * \\"I do not consider myself a poet, rather I know that I love poetry\\" = Poetry collections (Czech titles) = Magor≈Øv rann√≠ zpƒõv, samizdat 1975 - complete collection of his first poems * Magorova krabiƒçka, samizdat 1979 * Ml√°d√≠ nevykou≈ôen√©, samizdat 1975, 1979 and 1980 - in all three of his first poetry collections, Egon Bondy's influence is evident * Magorovo bor√°go, samizdat 1981 * Magorova mystick√° r≈Ø≈æe, samizdat 1981 * Magorovy labut√≠ p√≠snƒõ, samizdat 1985, London 1989 - This collection arose while Jirous was in prison and was smuggled out to be published.

He is known for his inking work on a wide variety of DC Comics titles, including the continuity-redefining Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985‚Äì1986), his long run working on the Superman titles from 1986‚Äì1993, and for writing and painting the Captain Marvel original graphic novel The Power of Shazam! (1994), and writing the ongoing monthly series from 1995‚Äì1999. He has provided inks for artists such as Curt Swan, Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, John Buscema, Steve Ditko, John Byrne, George Perez and others. Early life and influences Jerry Ordway was inspired in his childhood by Marvel Comics, and dreamed of drawing Daredevil, Spider-Man, and the Avengers. To date he has only worked on the latter. Ordway is Jewish.NYCC 2015: COMICS AND JEWS with Paul Levitz, Paul ... www.comicosity.com ‚Ä∫ News Sep 30, 2015 - Presented by the American Jewish Historical Society ... The event will feature a discussion with writers, artists, and historians Karen Green, ... prominent Jewish comic writers such as Roy Thomas, Rich Buckler, Ellen Weiss, ... Among the artists he considers influential are Curt Swan, Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, John Buscema, Steve Ditko, all of whose pencils he would later ink over. He cites Gene Colan, Wally Wood, Alex Raymond, Hal Foster and Roy Crane as early inspirations. He names contemporaries such as Lee Weeks, John Romita Jr., Ron Garney, Mike Weiringo and Alan Davis, and inkers such as Joe Sinnott, Dick Giordano, Tom Palmer and Klaus Janson. Ordway attended Milwaukee Technical High School, where he took a three-year commercial art course, before joining a commercial art studio as a typographer in 1976. He subsequently worked his way \\"from the ground floor up at the art studio\\" between 1978 and 1981. Comics career Before beginning his professional career as an inker, Jerry Ordway entered the comics industry as an artist and publisher for small-press comics fanzines. Ordway discovered Marvel comics in \\"June of 1967,\\" and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had \\"been drawing superheroes [ever] since.\\" His first published work, a story entitled \\"The Messenger\\", appeared in Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics No. 4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine Okay Comix followed in May‚ÄìJune, 1975.Ordway, Jerry \\"What? Another 'zine?\\" in Ordway's Okay Comix No. 1 (May‚ÄìJune, 1975), p. 2 Okay Comix featured stories by Ordway and his friend Dave Koula, and art predominantly by Ordway himself. Ordway's own hero \\"Proton\\" headlined the 'zine, which featured a pin-up of a character \\"called Acrobat\\" who was \\"the first superhero [Ordway] created. His birth was Dec. 1969.\\"Okay Comix No. 1 (May‚ÄìJune, 1975), p. 24 Spending the late 1970s working as a painter in a commercial art studio in Milwaukee, between 1978 and 1979, he provided illustrations for a number of fanzines and pro-zines, including Omniverse and The Comics Journal. His first professional work was for Western Publishing's Golden Books on young-reader Marvel books, and the Superheroes Golden Beginning Stampbook '79. =DC Comics= Having produced comics-related artwork for fanzines and licensed publishers, Ordway attended \\"a talent search at the 1980 Chicago Comicon,\\" held by DC Comics. After showing them his \\"DC related artwork from the Golden Books,\\" he \\"walked away with a promise of work.\\" This work began in the summer of 1980 for \\"DC's anthology comics,\\" (including Weird War Tales and Mystery in Space) in which he \\"inked Carmine Infantino, Trevor Von Eeden, as well as Joe Staton, and Dave Cockrum.\\" After continuing to work at the art studio for a further six months, inking comics for DC by night, Ordway began \\"freelancing full time in February 1981.\\" During the mid-1980s, he \\"shared a studio with other artists, including Machlan, Pat Broderick, and Al Vey.\\" At DC, he would illustrate All-Star Squadron, a series which he helped launch in an insert preview in Justice League of America No. 193 (Aug. 1981). With writer Roy Thomas, he co-created Infinity, Inc. in All-Star Squadron No. 25 (Sept. 1983) and the new team was launched in its own series in March 1984.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 207: \\"Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, Infinity, Inc. was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper.\\" Ordway inked DC Comics Presents Annual No. 4 (1985) over artist Eduardo Barreto's pencils, was one of several artists on Batman Annual No. 9 (July 1985), inked George P√©rez's pencils on the epic crossover miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985 and Superman artist Wayne Boring's pencils for a retelling of the definitive Golden Age Superman origin story written by Roy Thomas in Secret Origins No. 1 (April 1986), which he considers a particular favorite. Ordway was the penciller and inker for the DC Comics adaptation of the 1989 Batman film which was published as a \\"movie special\\". Ordway has noted that \\"Inking is a weird job, because as much as you put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler.\\" =Superman= In 1986, along with writer/artist John Byrne and writer Marv Wolfman, Ordway revamped Superman, in the wake of the Ordway-inked continuity-redefining maxiseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. Launching, with a revised origin and new continuity, in Byrne's miniseries, The Man of Steel, Superman soon returned to featuring in a number of titles. After the titular title Superman was cancelled and replaced with The Man of Steel, it was relaunched as The Adventures of Superman, continuing the numbering of the original Superman series, with Wolfman as writer and Ordway as artist.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 226: \\"The original Superman title had adopted the new title The Adventures of Superman but continued the original numbering of its long and storied history. Popular writer Marv Wolfman and artist Jerry Ordway handled the creative chores.\\" When Wolfman departed the title with issue #435, Byrne briefly took over script writing duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely with issue #445 (Oct. 1988), making his writing debut two issues earlier with #443 (Aug. 1988). Ordway had also served as co-plotter on a few issues during both Wolfman and Bryne's writing tenures (issues #426, 435-437, 439-442, and 444). Switching from The Adventures of Superman, Ordway became the writer-artist on the companion title Superman vol. 2 between #34 (Aug. 1989) and #55 (May 1991), before later returning to Adventures of Superman as writer and sometimes as cover artist from issues #480 (July 1991) to #500 (June 1993). Ordway was the writer and primary artist for the story in which Clark Kent proposes to Lois Lane.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 247: \\"When [Clark Kent] proposed to his longtime love Lois Lane, he did so in a modest fashion...Lois accepted and comic book history was made, served up by writer/artist Jerry Ordway.\\" While writing for the Superman family of titles, Ordway cowrote such storylines as \\"Panic in the Sky\\"Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 253: \\"In this seven-part adventure...writers Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Roger Stern, and Louise Simonson, with artists Brett Breeding, Tom Grummett, Jon Bogdanove, and Bob McLeod assembled many of DC's favorite characters to defend the world.\\" and \\"The Death of Superman\\" storyline in 1992. After seven years working on the character, Ordway largely left the Superman titles in 1993, although he would make frequent returns to the character as writer and throughout his career, co-writing Adventures of Superman with Karl Kesel from issues #539-540, 558-562, 564-567 in 1996, and 1998-1999. In Nov. 2017, he drew the variant cover for Action Comics #992 (cover dated Jan. 2018). During the 50th anniversary celebrations for Superman, he inked John Byrne's pencils for the cover of the March 14, 1988 issue of Time magazine and an interior spread celebrating the Man of Steel's anniversary. Ordway has produced a large number of covers for DC from 1982 onwards, including for issues of Secret Origins and the painted cover art to the hardcover reprint collection The Greatest Golden Age Stories Ever Told. He produced the cover art for the prestige format graphic novels, Superman: The Earth Stealers in 1988 where he inked Curt Swan's pencils and Superman For Earth (1991), among other work. =Captain Marvel= In 1994, Ordway masterminded the return of the original Captain Marvel to the DC Universe with the 96-page hardcover graphic novel The Power of Shazam!, which he both wrote and painted. The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former- Fawcett Comics superhero. It proved to be a success, and was followed by an ongoing monthly series, also titled The Power of Shazam! (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series- regular artists Peter Krause and Mike Manley.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 269: \\"Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort The Power of Shazam!, alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause.\\" Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer & artist. =Non-DC work= During the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies. Companies included Wendy and Richard Pini's WaRP Graphics, AC Comics, Charlton Comics, Paragon Publications and fan-turned-pro Marty Greim. For Eclipse Comics, Ordway provided pencils for a short \\"Epilogue\\" story in Mark Evanier's DNAgents No. 18 (Jan. 1985). He produced Munden's Bar for First Comics, and provided pencils and inks on an issue of T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents. For Image Comics, Ordway co-created the character WildStar with Al Gordon in 1993, and published his creator-owned one-shot The Messenger in July 2000. Although the vast majority of Ordway's professional work has been produced for DC, Ordway inked issues of Marvel's Fantastic Four. He produced occasional work for Marvel between 1984 and 1988, then returned a decade later to write and illustrate a three-issue arc of The Avengers vol. 3 #16‚Äì18 (1999), guest artist on Captain America (vol. 3) #32 (Aug. 2000) with writer Dan Jurgens, as well as penciling the four-issue crossover mini-series Maximum Security (#1‚Äì3 and prologue Dangerous Planet), and writer/penciller on a U.S. Agent mini-series in 2000-2001. He was artist for the one-shot Captain America and the Invaders: Bahamas Triangle with writer Roy Thomas, released in July 2019. =Other DC work= As well as inking most of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Ordway inked the second of DC's continuity-redefining event titles in 1994 by inking writer-artist Dan Jurgens' pencils on Zero Hour: Crisis in Time.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 266: \\"In DC's newest summer blockbuster Zero Hour, writer/artist Dan Jurgens and finisher Jerry Ordway crafted a five-issue story that began with issue #4, and counted backward to zero.\\" In 2001, he drew the one-shot Just Imagine... Stan Lee with Jerry Ordway Creating the JLA as part of Marvel-stalwart Stan Lee's foray into the DC Universe, in which the two of them re-imagined DC's Justice League of America. He inked the last year (May 2002-May 2003) of the Batman-related title Azrael: Agent of the Bat (#88-100), and provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in Wonder Woman (vol. 2, issues #189-194), with writer Walt Simonson in 2003. In 2004, Ordway was inker on JLA issues #94-99, the ‚ÄúTenth Circle‚Äù story arc which reunited the former Uncanny X-Men creative team of writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne. From 2003-2008, he provided new covers to the Superman: The Man of Steel series of six trade paperbacks, collecting the early adventures of the Post-Crisis Superman. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the original Crisis, DC published Geoff Johns' Infinite Crisis limited series (Dec. 2005-June 2006), for which Ordway provided the artwork for the flashback scenes set on Earth-Two, including a recreation of the cover to Action Comics #1, which he cites as another favorite piece of his. In the wake of Infinite Crisis, he inked Dan Jurgens' pencils once again in the \\"History of the Multiverse\\" back-up stories in the weekly comic book 'Countdown' (issues No. 39 and No. 38, Chapters 11 and 12) (October 2007). His work since 2008 includes pencilling three issues of The Brave and the Bold (volume 2) (#11‚Äì13, May-July 2008) with writer Mark Waid, and pencils for Justice Society of America Annual No. 1 (Sept. 2008), alongside some interior artwork for the ongoing Justice Society of America series during late 2008.

The Hoya is a student-run paper that prints every Friday and publishes online daily throughout the year, with a print circulation of 4,000 during the academic year. The newspaper has four main editorial sections: News, Opinion, Sports and The Guide, a weekly arts and lifestyle magazine. It also publishes several annual special issues including a New Student Guide, a basketball preview and a semesterly fashion issue. Although The Hoya is not financially independent from the university, it is produced, managed and edited entirely by students and maintains editorial independence. Over 250 students are involved in the publication of the paper. History alt=Several young men and women sit in office chairs working at computers around a room where the walls are covered in printed pages. A central wood table and bookcases are featured. = Founding = The first issue of The Hoya was published on January 14, 1920, under the editorship of Joseph R. Mickler, Jr. Student journalism at Georgetown can be traced as far back as 1824 and the appearance of a hand-copied publication titled Minerva. The Hoya, however, was distinguished from previous student publications by its intent to be a comprehensive university newspaper. The publication took its name from the phrase 'Hoya Saxa', which had been adopted as a common chant at Georgetown sports events in the 1890s. The popularity of the term spread as local newspapers often cited the Hoya, and \\"Hoya\\" began to be widely applied to campus organizations and to athletic groups themselves. = First 40 years = Beginning in the 1940s, the publication shifted its main coverage from athletic to campus events. Weathering the Great Depression, World War II, student unrest in the 1960s and funding cuts in the 1970s, The Hoya has appeared almost continuously since its founding, providing a student perspective on issues and events. In its early years, The Hoya published once a week, focused mainly on internal, campus affairs, promoting student organizations and school functions, and devoted a large part of its coverage to sports. In 1930, The Hoya received the highest rating given to a college weekly publication by the National Collegiate Press Association. In the late 1930s, international events began to influence content. The Hoya was one of the few student groups to remain active during the war years, and its pages at this time juxtapose coverage of blood drives, war bond programs and alumni casualties with details of tea dances and intramural athletics. In the post- war era, the paper's focus returned to internal campus issues, perhaps reflecting the desire of veterans, who made up most of the student body, to return to normal life. The 1950s saw the introduction of two recurring features: the Basketball Preview Issue, which first appeared on December 3, 1957, and the April Fools' issue. One of the high points of The Hoyas entertainment reporting came in 1964, when one of its reporters managed to interview the Beatles, who were in Washington for their first live concert appearance in the U.S. The interview appeared in the issue of February 20, 1964. = 1970s and Watergate = In the 1970s, university support for the paper fell significantly; for example, funding was cut more than 55 percent between 1971 and 1975. As a result, the newspaper was forced to increase its advertising fourfold, and full-page advertisements became common. The paper changed its format from tabloid to broadsheet in the fall of 1976. As the Georgetown student body became more diverse, coverage of minority student groups increased, and articles on the activities and concerns of African American and Jewish students appeared. Women's athletics received more detailed coverage, as did the impact of Title IX, and by the end of the decade, references to \\"girls\\" and \\"hoyettes\\" had been eliminated from the sports pages. Issues in the spring of 1973 contained coverage of attempts by gay students to organize and obtain official recognition. The years of 1973 and 1974 saw a number of articles on the Nixon Administration and the Watergate scandal. The coverage of Watergate is possibly linked to the fact that a number of players in the Watergate investigations had Georgetown connections. In the post-Watergate era, perhaps influenced by the event, The Hoya began to run investigative journalism pieces. As a result, the paper went from being viewed as generally supportive of the administration to being one of the university‚Äôs chief antagonists. The spring of 1977 brought perhaps the most significant example of this when a story about the firing of five resident assistants led to a university hearing about the entire residence life system and, ultimately, to the resignation of both a vice president and a dean. = 1980s and expansion = A number of significant changes to The Hoyas production occurred during the 1980s. The first issue of 1980, produced on January 25, was the first to appear without the approval of a faculty moderator who had previously been a member of the editorial board. And, after six decades of appearing once a week, The Hoya moved to a twice-weekly schedule beginning in the fall of 1987. Other changes included the adoption of the current masthead in 1982 and the development of standard typefaces for headlines and copy. = 1990s to present = The 1990s saw the consolidation and expansion of The Hoyas entertainment coverage into a pullout arts and lifestyle section titled The Guide. The paper already had a long tradition of providing coverage and reviews of both on-campus and off-campus entertainment, with reviews of off-campus plays and movies first appearing in 1929. In 1998, The Hoya launched a website. The Hoya also has two official blogs, The Fourth Edition, launched in 2012, which provides a lighthearted take on Georgetown and D.C. news, and Hoya Paranoia, launched in 2008, which covers university athletics throughout the year as well as providing commentary on national and international sports news. The Hoya joined Facebook in 2008 and has been on Twitter since 2009. In 2017, The Hoya announced its transition into an online- daily format, publishing articles on a daily rather than biweekly basis. In the move to an online format, the paper also reduced its print publication from two issues a week to one, cutting its Tuesday issue while retaining the weekly Friday edition. Campaign for independence In 2004, the newspaper began its official bid to gain financial independence from the university. The Hoya receives around $25,000 from Georgetown University for its operation annually. Late in 2004, the newspaper launched a publicity bid to build grassroots support for the proposition; the school seemed willing to allow the paper to split off, but not with the name \\"The Hoya\\", which administrators claimed belonged to the school. In 2007, the school filed for a trademark on the name. The newspaper relaunched the campaign in early 2008 and circulated a petition that gained over 600 signatures from students and alumni. Though this campaign might have been successful, an April Fool's issue in 2009 put a hold on the independence movement. The issue included several articles that were perceived as racist and insensitive. The newspaper faced significant sanctions for the issue. In a Letter from the Editor in the first issue of the fall 2010 semester, The Hoya acknowledged that the notorious April Fools' day issue of 2009 was distasteful, but assured its readers that the newspaper would no longer participate in satirical issues. No April Fools' issues have been published since 2009. The Hoyas Board of Directors voted in 2010 to delay independence until the national economy and the paper's financial situation becomes more favorable.  Sections  = Editorial = The editorial division is responsible for decisions regarding the content of The Hoya. Two executive editors and the managing editor are selected at the end of the fall and spring semesters and serve for one-semester terms. Senior editors of each section are elected at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Each section‚Äôs deputy editors are appointed by the respective senior editor. Senior editors serve one-semester terms at a time, although the editor-in-chief serves for an entire calendar year. The current editor-in- chief is Kiera Geraghty.  Editorial Board  The Editorial Board is composed of three staff members and three community members, and is chaired by the opinion editor. The Editorial Board, which produces The Hoyas editorials, is an autonomous body whose views do not represent the opinions of The Hoya. = Publishing = The publishing division manages the business operations. The general manager and departmental directors are hired by the Board of Directors. The current general manager is Dave Towell. = Board of Directors = The Board of Directors oversees the overall strategic direction of the newspaper. The current chair of the board of directors is Amber Gillette.

Life  He was born at Sulzheim. He studied law at W√ºrzburg and G√∂ttingen, became professor of public law in the university of W√ºrzburg in 1799, and in 1819 was sent as a deputy to the Landtag of Bavaria. Having associated himself with the party of reform, he was regarded with suspicion by the Bavarian king Maximilian I and the court party, although favoured for a time by Maximilian's son, the future King Louis I. In 1821 he was compelled to give up his professorship, but he continued to agitate for reform, and in 1831 the king refused to recognize his election to the Landtag. A speech delivered by Behr in 1832 was regarded as seditious, and he was arrested. In spite of his assertion of loyalty to the principle of monarchy he was detained in custody, and in 1836 was found guilty of seeking to injure the king. He then admitted his offence; but he was not released from prison until 1839, and the next nine years of his life were passed under police supervision at Passau and Regensburg. In 1848 he obtained a free pardon and a sum of money as compensation, and was sent to the German national assembly which met at Frankfurt in May of that year. He passed his remaining days at Bamberg.

For other meanings of the word catastrophe, including catastrophe theory in mathematics, see catastrophe (disambiguation). Catastrophe modeling Mitchell-Wallace, K. Jones, M., Hillier, J. K., Foote, M. (2017) Natural catastrophe risk management and modelling: A practitioner‚Äôs guide. Wiley . (also known as cat modeling) is the process of using computer-assisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake. Cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the insurance industry and is at the confluence of actuarial science, engineering, meteorology, and seismology.  Catastrophes/ Perils  Natural catastrophes (sometimes referred to as \\"nat cat\\") that are modeled include: * Hurricane (main peril is wind damage; some models can also include storm surge) * Earthquake (main peril is ground shaking; some models can also include tsunami, fire following earthquakes, and sprinkler leakage damage) * severe thunderstorm (main perils are tornado and hail) * Flood * Extratropical cyclone * Wildfire * Winter storm Human catastrophes include: * Terrorism events * Warfare * Casualty/liability events * Displacement CrisesEdwards, Scott. The Chaos of Forced Migration: A Means of Modeling Complexity for Humanitarian Ends *Cyber data breaches  Lines of business modeled  Cat modeling involves many lines of business, including: *Personal property * Commercial property * Workers' compensation * Automobile physical damage * Limited liabilities * Product liability * Business Interruption  Inputs, Outputs, and Use Cases  The input into a typical cat modeling software package is information on the exposures being analyzed that are vulnerable to catastrophe risk. The exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups: * Information on the site locations, referred to as geocoding data (street address, postal code, county/CRESTA zone, etc.) * Information on the physical characteristics of the exposures (construction, occupation/occupancy, year built, number of stories, number of employees, etc.) * Information on the financial terms of the insurance coverage (coverage value, limit, deductible, etc.) The output of a cat model is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events. When running a probabilistic model, the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution; probable maximum losses (\\"PMLs\\") and average annual losses (\\"AALs\\") are calculated from the loss distribution. When running a deterministic model, losses caused by a specific event are calculated; for example, Hurricane Katrina or \\"a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown San Francisco\\" could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures. Cat models have a variety of use cases for a number of industries, including: *Insurers and risk managers use cat modeling to assess the risk in a portfolio of exposures. This might help guide an insurer's underwriting strategy or help them decide how much reinsurance to purchase. * Some state departments of insurance allow insurers to use cat modeling in their rate filings to help determine how much premium their policyholders are charged in catastrophe- prone areas. * Insurance rating agencies such as A. M. Best and Standard & Poor's use cat modeling to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk. * Reinsurers and reinsurance brokers use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of reinsurance treaties. * European insurers use cat models to derive the required regulatory capital under the Solvency II regime. Cat models are used to derive catastrophe loss probability distributions which are components of many Solvency II internal capital models. * Likewise, cat bond investors, investment banks, and bond rating agencies use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of a catastrophe bond.  Open catastrophe modeling  The Oasis Loss Modelling Framework (\\"LMF\\") is an open source catastrophe modeling platform. It developed by a nonprofit organisation funded and owned by the Insurance Industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency. Additionally, some firms within the insurance industry are currently working with the Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (\\"ACORD\\") to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data.

Life and career Hill was born in Fort St. John, British Columbia. Before entering politics, Hill had served as the president of the B.C. Grain Producers Association, and as the Director for Grain with the B.C. Federation of Agriculture. Hill was first elected as a member of the Parliament of Canada with the Reform Party of Canada in 1993. Hill generally voted along official party lines. He opposed changes to divorce laws that would reduce the amount of time divorced fathers spend with their children, and has attempted to help refugees get admitted to Canada. Additionally, Hill called for an inquiry into the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's role in the 1985 Air India bombing. Generally, he is viewed as a right wing Conservative, he has repeatedly called all Government surpluses overtaxation. After the Reform Party transformed into the Canadian Alliance in 2000, Hill was one of seven Members of Parliament ejected from caucus in 2001 for questioning the abilities of then-leader Stockwell Day. This group remained committed to the ideals of the Canadian Alliance, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus (DR) as a way to maintain their efforts. Hill served in various roles for his party, including Chief Whip as well as the opposition critic for National Defence, Transport and Justice ministries. He is the only MP to have served as Whip four times (for the Reform Party, Canadian Alliance, DR/Progressive Conservative Coalition and for the Conservative Party of Canada), both in Opposition and in Government. He also served as House Leader, both in Opposition and in Government. One of Hill's private members bills resulted in the Adoption Expense Tax Credit, introduced in the 2005 federal budget. His bill called for tax breaks for couples who adopt children. On February 16, 2006, Hill was made a privy councillor and the Chief Government Whip, a key position in a minority government. On January 4, 2007, he was appointed Secretary of State in the Harper government; On October 30, 2008, he became Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, serving until August 6, 2010. Hill retired from politics on October 25, 2010.\\"Jay Hill leaves Parliament on his own terms\\", Globe and Mail, July 30, 2010 He was honoured at a retirement dinner in Fort St. John, attended by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, BC Premier Christy Clark, Reform Party of Canada founder and former Opposition Leader Preston Manning and numerous other colleagues and friends. On June 23, 2020, it was announced that following a conference on Zoom, Hill was selected as the new leader of the Wexit Canada Party, a political party that has as its stated goal the creation of an independent country in Western Canada. The party's name was later changed to the Maverick Party in September.

F. Lawton and starring Shannon Tweed and Bill Maher. The film sends up many pop culture motifs and societal trends, including feminism (and feminist movements' fragmentation around various issues), B movies (particularly Cannibal Holocaust), celebrities, major writers and political figures, centred around a spoof of Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. It was the first feature directed (under the pseudonym J. D. Athens) by screenwriter J. F. Lawton, who also authored Pretty Woman, Under Siege and its sequel, and television show V.I.P. Plot The U.S. government grows worried for the nation's avocado supply after some confrontations with the \\"Piranha\\" tribe of cannibal women, who live in the mysterious \\"Avocado Jungle\\" (westernmost outpost: San Bernardino) and ritually sacrifice and eat men. The government recruits Margo Hunt (Tweed), a professor of feminist studies at a local university (\\"Spritzer College\\"), to travel into the Avocado Jungle and make contact with the women to attempt to convince them to move to a reservation/condo in Malibu. Along the way, she and her travelling companions ‚Äî male chauvinist guide Jim (Maher) and ditzy undergraduate Bunny (Karen Mistal) ‚Äî meet a tribe of subservient men called the \\"Donnahew\\" (a reference to talk-show host Phil Donahue) and face dangers in their path. Eventually, the trio (Margo, Bunny and Jim) meets the Piranha women, who have recently taken Dr. Kurtz (played by Adrienne Barbeau) as their \\"empress.\\" Kurtz is Dr. Hunt's former colleague in feminist studies (the internationally famous author of Smart Women, Stupid Insensitive Men) and now her nemesis; she has joined the tribe of Piranha women with her own exploitative agenda. The two argue about the morality of sacrificing men and the exploitation of the Piranha women, and Bunny decides to join the tribe, her first sacrifice being Jim. Bunny cannot go through with the kill, however, and Dr. Hunt escapes, aided by the handsome, intelligent, and sensitive Jean-Pierre (Brett Stimely), who also was to be sacrificed. Dr. Margo Hunt finds in the jungle a rival tribe of cannibal women, the Barracuda Women, who are at war with the Piranha women due to differences over which condiment (guacamole or clam dip) most appropriately accompanies a meal of sacrificed man. Hunt returns to the Piranha stronghold with this other tribe and rescues Bunny and Jim as well as Jean-Pierre. Margo Hunt challenges Kurtz to a duel for supremacy, and they argue while fighting with various weapons; eventually, Margo impales Kurtz with a fencing sword. Kurtz explains her motives to Hunt in her last words: After ruling the Piranha tribe, she cannot return to civilization and the talk-show circuit. She then kills herself by plunging into a pit filled with water and piranha fish. Having discovered the government plot to domesticate the Piranha women by providing aerobics classes and frequent exposure to Cosmopolitan magazine, Hunt refuses to bring the Piranha women with her, and instead persuades the warring cannibal tribes to reunite, maintaining the peace by means of consciousness raising groups. The film ends happily for the trio of main characters: Bunny and Jim are to be married, and Jean-Pierre has enrolled at Dr. Hunt's university as a feminist studies major, becoming in the process the ideal companion for Hunt. CastBill Maher as Jim *Shannon Tweed as Dr. Margo Hunt *Adrienne Barbeau as Dr. Kurtz *Karen Mistal as Bunny *Barry Primus as Ford Maddox *Jim McKrell as Dean Stockwell *Pat Crawford Brown as Secretary Allusions The film's plot loosely parallels that of novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, as well as Apocalypse Now, which was also partly based on Heart of Darkness. Both Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now feature a character named Kurtz who has gone deep into the jungle to become the deranged leader of a group of \\"savages\\"; these peoples engage in barbaric rites as an alternative to the rigid and restrictive values of the outside world. The name of the character Ford Maddox, one of the men who recruits Margo to enter the jungle, refers to author Ford Madox Ford, who collaborated on three novels with Conrad (though not on Heart of Darkness). When Kurtz and Hunt battle with fencing swords, Kurtz is stabbed, and her dying words are: \\"You don't know what it's like, trying to face David Letterman with a book on male insensitivity ... All right, I was exploiting the Piranha women. You don't know what it was like. David Letterman, God, the horror ... the horror of that show ... the horror.\\" In Heart of Darkness, Kurtz's dying words are: \\"The horror! The horror!\\" MiscellaneousAuthor Daryl F. Mallett was an extra in this film. *Filmed almost entirely on location at the University of California, Riverside campus, where J. F. Lawton's father, author Harry Lawton, was a professor. *Is the source for the song \\"Piranha Women of the Avocado Jungle of Death\\" by Christine Lavin. Lavin‚Äôs aunt Pat Crawford Brown played the secretary in the film. *Featured in 13 Nights of Elvira. *Bill Maher, who acted in the movie, brought up the film during the January 29th, 2016 broadcast of his HBO series Real Time with Bill Maher.  Reception  Reviews for the film run the gamut. One reviewer described it as \\"a brilliantly absurd story\\" and \\"a hilariously tongue-in-cheek premise, wonderfully layered humor that runs from broad slapstick to clever satire, and a cast that's filled to the brim with beautiful women wearing very, very little.\\" The Digital Fix's reviewer wrote: TV Guide granted the movie 2 out of 4 stars: \\"This film is not nearly as bad as it might have been, thanks largely to the leads. Moreover, CANNIBAL WOMEN does manage to be on target with its humor from time to time. But there are far more misses than hits as the movie also goes for the corny, the obvious, and the ancient.\\" Julian White of Starburst (a British science fiction magazine), rated the movie 6 out of 10 stars, calling it \\"a light-hearted romp\\" and saying, \\"It's all unashamedly joky and facetious, but also very likeable. The look of the film is rough and ready ... Even the biggest fans of this film would have to admit that director J. F. Lawton is unlikely to go down in history as one of cinema's great visual stylists. That said, he's a very capable screenwriter (as he subsequently demonstrated by penning such perennial favourites as Pretty Woman and Under Siege), and there are some surprisingly sophisticated one-liners lurking among the slapstick. True, the constant ribbing at feminists now seems very dated, but it's never mean-spirited, and anyway the girls give as good as they get.\\" References External links 1989 films American films 1980s comedy horror films American parody films Films about cannibalism English-language films Films based on works by Joseph Conrad Parodies of horror 1989 comedy films ","title":"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"},{"id":"1846858","text":"Pierre Nelson Leval (born September 4, 1936) is a Senior United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

It is played every hour on the hour, four times in succession in each of the four cardinal directions, by a trumpeter on the highest tower of the city's Saint Mary's Church. The noon performance is broadcast via radio to all of Poland and the world. History =Origins= The real origin and author of the hejna≈Ç are unknown. The earliest written mention of it appears in civic pay records of 1392. The word hejna≈Ç comes from hajnal, the Hungarian word for \\"dawn\\". These two facts fit well with a putative origin under King Louis I \\"the Hungarian\\" (r. in Poland 1370‚Äì82) or his daughter Jadwiga, Queen of Poland (r. 1384‚Äì99). Trumpet calls were used in many European cities to signal the opening and closing of city gates at dawn and dusk. The four directions in which the St. Mary's Trumpet Call is currently sounded correspond roughly to the four main Krak√≥w gates before 3 out of 4 of the gates were demolished in the 19th century. 16th- century sources mention other trumpeters on other towers, and it is possible that the ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù anthem was originally meant to allow a second trumpeter at a gate to signal the completion of the opening or closing of the gate. In historic times, trumpet calls on the St. Mary's Church tower were also used to warn of fires and other dangers. =Legends= Hejna≈Ç played \\"for the King\\", towards the south. According to a popular 20th-century legend, during a Mongol invasion of Poland (the invasion usually cited is that of 1241), Mongol troops led by General Subutai approached Krak√≥w. A sentry on a tower of St Mary's Church sounded the alarm by playing the Hejna≈Ç, and the city gates were closed before the Tatars could ambush the city. The trumpeter, however, was shot in the throat and did not complete the anthem, and this is the legendary reason as to why performances end abruptly before completion. The earliest written version of this legend is from the prologue to American Eric P. Kelly‚Äôs 1928 children's book The Trumpeter of Krakow. Kelly, who was teaching at the Jagiellonian University on a scholar exchange in 1925-26, admitted that he did not speak the Polish language very well when he wrote the story, and had relied on French-speaking friends to translate. Part of the current legend may come from a more recent historic incident when a trumpeter died of natural causes while on duty at midnight on 7 July 1901. A 1926 tourist guide vaguely states that the death of a trumpeter was the reason for the premature ending of the anthem, but does not mention the Tartar siege or arrows. Another possible reason is Ludwik Anczyc's 1861 version of the Lajkonik legend, which describes the sentry and the invading Tatars without mentioning arrows or the sentry's death. It is possible that Kelly was simply the first to write down the full version of an existing Cracovian legend that had escaped earlier collectors. It is also possible that he was the victim of a hoax or accidentally conflated two different stories. It is certainly remarkable that Professor Karol Estreicher, Jr.‚Äôs thorough 1931 guide to Krak√≥w does not include the story. Whatever the origins of Kelly's story, it proved popular in Krak√≥w. The first written version of the full Tartars and arrows version in Polish is from a 1935 tourist guide. The second appears in a fiction sequel by Ksawery Pruszy≈Ñski (who was a student at the Jagiellonian University while Kelly was teaching and was later Estreicher's assistant) entitled The Trumpeter of Samarkand which also ties into the Lajkonik legend. After the Second World War, Kelly's role in the legend was largely forgotten and the legend began to be passed down in true folk fashion. Another recent tradition has it that the four directions in which the tune is played are in honour of the King (southwards towards Wawel Castle); the Mayor or Bishop towards City Hall or Bishop's Palace on Kanonicza Street, the citizens towards Main Market Square, and the peasants and visitors (towards the fields outside Krak√≥w and the Barbican of Krakow). At the end of each tune the trumpeter waves at the people in the square who are expected to wave back. =Later usage= The Hejna≈Ç being played at foot of Monte Cassino Abbey after Allied victory in the Battle of Monte Cassino. The Hejna≈Ç was traditionally played twice a day, usually at dawn and dusk; noon was added later. Today, the trumpeter plays hourly, though sleepy trumpeters are sometimes reported to have missed one of the early morning hours. Since 1927 the Hejna≈Ç has been broadcast live on Polskie Radio (the Polish national radio station) from St Mary's Church daily at noon. The Krak√≥w Hejna≈Ç is well known throughout Poland and has been used as a national symbol. During the Second World War, a bugler from the 2nd Polish Corps played the tune to announce the Polish victory in the Battle of Monte Cassino on 18 May 1944. Historical records show that the practise of playing the Hejna≈Ç has been cancelled and then later reinstated several times, with a particularly long gap before it was reinstated in 1810. The Hejna≈Ç Mariacki was replaced twice by the mourning song ≈Åzy Matki (English: \\"The Tears of the Mother\\"). The first time was at noon on 3 April 2005, due to the death of Pope John Paul II the previous day, and the second at two minutes after noon on 11 April 2010 following the deaths of President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and his consort, Maria Kaczy≈Ñska. =Players= Originally played by the town guard, since the 19th century the Hejna≈Ç has been performed by active members of the fire brigade, who also use the church tower as a lookout post. Currently, there are at least four different buglers serving in shifts at the tower. The longest-serving trumpeter was Adolf ≈ömietana, who played the Hejna≈Ç for 36 years beginning in 1926. The Ko≈Çton family has played the Hejna≈Ç for three consecutive generations. In October 2004, Jan Ko≈Çton retired after 33 years of service at the tower. His father had been a Hejna≈Ç bugler for 35 years previously, while his son is one of the four current buglers. On 11 June 2000 the melody was listed in the Guinness Book of Records after it was played by almost 2,000 trumpeters from all over the world. They included military orchestras from Poland, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain, as well as civilians. The youngest bugler was eight years old; the oldest was 79.

Currently owned by Coventry Real Estate Advisors, the mall is anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, Ross Dress For Less, TJ Maxx, and Walmart with one vacant space last occupied by Sears. it is the 20th largest mall in Orange County, with around of retail space. It has languished in sales, however; at $123 million, it brings in half of other malls its size, such as WP Glimcher's Westminster Mall and Westfield MainPlace. History Built in 1961, the Buena Park Mall was one of the first malls in Orange County, anchored by JCPenney, Sears, and May Company California (which opened in 1963). A United Artists movie theater opened in August 1984, to close in 1999; the space has been converted for retail use. May Company closed in January 1993 as one of the 12 J. W. Robinson's and May Company stores closing due to the merging of the two department stores to form Robinson's-May and in November of that same year, the closed May Company became a discount chain Fedco. The mall was neglected in the 1980s and 1990s even as the local retail market changed. In 1995 a group controlled by the Pritzker family of Chicago bought the mall for $41 million from Australia's City Freeholds, Inc., and planned a $120 million renovation. The modernization was stalled for several years. After FedCo closed, the leaseholder sought to sublet the space to Gigante, a Mexican supermarket chain, and opposed a major renovation. Target, which had acquired FedCo in 1999, refused to allow the lease to be transferred to another discount retailer. Finally, in late 2001, the city of Buena Park itself paid $3.2 million to take over the Fedco lease and transfer it to Walmart, which now occupies the space.Businesses - Redevelopment Projects & Success Stories Completed in 2003, the renovation also replaced the former JCPenney with a new Krikorian Theaters multiplex. Burlington Coat Factory, a later addition, closed in 2005 and was replaced with Steve & Barry's which closed in 2008. Tower Records also operated in the mall until the demise of the chain in 2007. The Chicago eatery Portillo's opened their first Southern California outlet at the mall in 2005, next to the Pat & Oscar's, along the La Palma edge of the parking lot. Steve & Barry's closed in 2009. Circuit City was formerly one of the principal stores of Buena Park Place, but closed in 2009 due to its bankruptcy. On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store closed on February 2, 2020 making it the last original anchor store to close.

The Grand Portage Indian Reservation (Ojibwe language: Gichi-onigamiing) is located in Cook County near the tip of Minnesota's Arrowhead Region in the extreme northeast part of the state. The community was considered part of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa, but is not a party to the treaties that group signed. The reservation was established as part of an 1854 treaty, and the land area is 74.396 sq mi (192.686 km¬≤). The unincorporated community of Grand Portage is located within the Grand Portage Indian Reservation. Since 1934, it has been one of the six bands making up the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which wrote a constitution and initiated its new government in 1936. In the federal 2000 census, the reservation had a population of 557. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe reported in July 2007, Grand Portage had 1,127 people enrolled with the Band. Economy The community operates a casino, the Grand Portage Lodge and Casino. The Grand Portage National Monument is located on the reservation and managed by the National Park Service. The site includes a reconstructed trading post which is authentic for the 18th century. In 2000, Minnesota returned ownership of the Grand Portage State Park to the Chippewa Band, which was lost more than 50 years ago in a tax forfeiture. In a unique arrangement in the state, this is the only state park to be managed jointly by the state and an American Indian band. The park includes a 120-foot high waterfall, which has been a landmark for centuries.

For most of his career, Morton has performed with Robert Gibson as The Rock N' Roll Express, described as \\"the consummate baby face tag team\\". Morton has wrestled for multiple promotions in the United States including the Continental Wrestling Association, Mid-South Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, Smoky Mountain Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation, and Extreme Championship Wrestling, as well as the Japanese promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling, and Wrestle Association R. Morton has held dozens of championships throughout his career, including the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, USWA World Tag Team Championship, and WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. He has been inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame, and WWE Hall of Fame. His skill at driving audiences into a sympathetic frenzy by convincingly selling pain gave rise to the expression \\"playing Ricky Morton\\".  Professional wrestling career  = Continental Wrestling Association (1978‚Äì1985) = Morton was trained by his father, Paul, and by veteran wrestler Ken Lucas. He debuted in 1978, facing Ken Wayne in his debut match. He wrestled primarily for the Continental Wrestling Association in Memphis, Tennessee, often teaming with Lucas or Eddie Gilbert. Morton quickly became a popular performer thanks to his \\"athletic prowess\\", \\"sensational looks\\", and \\"spiky blond mullet\\". His popularity with female fans saw him dubbed a \\"teen idol\\". In early 1983, promoters Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Morton with Robert Gibson as The Rock 'n' Roll Express in an attempt to replicate the popularity of The Fabulous Ones. They won the Mid-South Tag Team Title three times and feuded with the team that would become their archrivals, The Midnight Express of Bobby Eaton and Dennis Condrey. Because of his small stature and good looks, he was usually made the \\"Face in Peril\\", meaning he would be the one to take most of the punishment in the matches to get the fans behind the team. He was also the one that always suffered a humiliation or \\"injury\\" to further the storyline the team would be involved in. Nowadays, this is sometimes referred to as \\"Playing Ricky Morton\\". In the early 80s Ricky formed a successful tag team with Robert Gibson in Joe Blanchard's South West wrestling territory feuding with The Grapplers. In 1984, Morton took part in a high profile angle with Randy Savage which saw Savage piledrive him through a table at ringside. = NWA Tri-State / Mid-South Wrestling (1981, 1984‚Äì1986, 1987) = In 1981, Morton began wrestling for NWA Tri-State. He formed a tag team with Eddie Gilbert, winning the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship twice. His second reign ended in August 1981 when he left the promotion. In 1984, Morton and Gibson began wrestling regularly for Mid-South Wrestling, the successor to NWA Tri-State. They won the Mid-South Tag Team Championship three times during 1984, trading the titles with The Midnight Express. Their third and final reign lasted until March 1985, when they lost to Steve Williams and Ted DiBiase. They continued to appear with Mid-South Wrestling until June 1985. Morton and Gibson reappeared with Mid-South Wrestling, by then renamed the Universal Wrestling Federation, throughout 1986. At the \\"Superdome Extravaganza\\" supercard in the Louisiana Superdome in June 1986, Morton unsuccessfully challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. = Jim Crockett Promotions (1985‚Äì1988) = In 1985, both teams moved on to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions and became famous due to the national television exposure of TBS. Ricky and Robert had a major feud with the \\"Russians\\", Ivan and Nikita Koloff and won the NWA World Tag Team Title. They traded the title again with the Russians and lost them to their hated rivals the Midnight Express on February 2, 1986 during Superstars on the Superstation due to their manager, Jim Cornette. Cornette used his tennis racket on Robert to help his team win. Fearing that his self-proclaimed sex appeal with women was being threatened by Morton, NWA Champion Ric Flair began a feud with Morton in 1986. In the spring of that year, Morton was having an interview at ringside when Flair came onto the set and insulted Morton's fans (who consisted mostly of tween girls) by calling them \\"teenyboppers in their training bras.\\" He gave Morton a training bra as a \\"gift from one of Flair's girlfriends\\" and told Morton that he couldn't handle real, grown-up women. In response, Morton stomped on Flair's sunglasses. This led to a fight and then a series of matches, the most notable being their Steel Cage match at the 1986 Great American Bash. To help build Morton as a serious title contender, it was pointed out that he once went to a one-hour draw with then-AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel. Morton never won the title but he proved that he was of the same caliber as Flair was in the ring. At one point in the feud with Flair, after a six-man tag team elimination match in which Morton pinned Flair to become the winner, Flair and the other three Four Horsemen invaded the Rock 'n' Roll Express' dressing room and attacked Morton, rubbing his face on the concrete floor, causing a grotesque-looking facial injury. They also broke his nose in another attack. Horsemen member Arn Anderson would also make fun of Morton, calling him \\"Punky Morton,\\" which was a play on the popular 1980s sitcom Punky Brewster. The term used to belittle Morton backfired when fans began to use it as a term of endearment. Morton and Gibson won the title back from the Midnight Express and feuded with Ole and Arn Anderson for the rest of the year. They culminated this feud with a win over the Andersons in a cage match at Starrcade on November 28. This victory started the Horsemen's dissatisfaction with Ole, who was kicked out of the stable just months later. Morton and Gibson then lost the title to Rick Rude and Manny Fernandez on December 6, 1986, whom they feuded with from December 1986 to June 1987. When Rude left for the World Wrestling Federation, the title was given back to the Rock & Roll Express, with the explanation that they won the title accompanied by footage of a prior non-title match won by the Rock & Roll Express where they pinned the champions. Morton and Gibson then feuded briefly with the New Breed, Sean Royal and Chris Champion, but this feud ended when the New Breed were injured in an auto accident. Their next feud was with Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, who won the title from them on September 29, 1987 after Jim Cornette's new Midnight Express of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane attacked them and injured Morton's arm and shoulder. Morton came out in the middle of the match and blindly tagged Gibson and courageously tried to wrestle but the Horsemen soon took advantage and Gibson gave up the match to save Morton more pain. They feuded for a few months with the Horsemen keeping the titles by getting themselves disqualified, and injuring Gibson's ribs. = All Japan Pro Wrestling (1988) = In May 1988, Morton and Gibson toured Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling, competing in the Super Power Series and facing teams including Samson Fuyuki and Toshiaki Kawada, Shinichi Nakano and Tiger Mask, and Isamu Teranishi and Masanobu Fuchi.

Gibson injured his knee and Morton teamed with Big Josh and Junkyard Dog to win the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. On June 12, 1991, at Clash of the Champions XV, Morton was in the ring to accept an invitation by Alexandra York to join her York Foundation. Gibson appeared and said he was healthy and ready to go and to everybody's shock, Morton turned on Gibson and beat him down before leaving with York, Mr. Hughes and Terrence Taylor. He changed his name to Richard Morton and they soon added Tommy Rich, who became Thomas Rich. They feuded with Gibson, Dustin Rhodes and Bobby Eaton and won the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Title. At The Great American Bash in July 1991, Morton defeated Gibson. In October 1991 at Halloween Havoc, Morton lost to Flyin' Brian in a bout for the newly created WCW Light Heavyweight Championship. They disbanded in early 1992 and Morton was used as a preliminary heel jobber where he teamed with various heels like Diamond Dallas Page. Morton made his last WCW TV appearance in a match against Barry Windham on July 18, 1992. Morton and Gibson returned to World Championship Wrestling in January 1993 feuding with The Heavenly Bodies. They appeared at SuperBrawl III and defeated Heavenly Bodies. = Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992‚Äì1995) = In 1992, Morton joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling and reformed the Rock & Roll Express with Gibson on August 8, 1992 in a match at Johnson City Tennessee. They went back and forth to the two promotions. They feuded with two versions of The Heavenly Bodies for the next year and a half, Stan Lane and Tom Prichard, and Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray. They feuded with The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) in 1994 and went to the NWA to win the Tag Title again in 1995. During 1995 he also teamed briefly with David Jericho.

Other media Morton made his WWE video game debut as DLC for WWE 2K18 along with Robert Gibson.  Personal life  Morton's father, Paul, was a professional wrestling referee. His cousin Todd Morton also wrestled, occasionally teaming with Morton. Morton was arrested in October 2005 for failing to pay child support. Morton contended that the outstanding payments were due to the child support amount having been set when he was earning a significant income working for major promotions as a part of The Rock N' Roll Express, and failed to reflect the much lower amount he was able to earn on the independent circuit. At least two benefit shows were put together in February 2006 to raise money towards his legal fees. A United Wrestling Association show in Alcoa, Tennessee on February 2, 2006, raised $2,475 for this cause. On February 15, 2006, Morton was released under the condition that he continue working and making efforts to catch up on the delinquent payments owed to his ex-wife. He returned to the ring the next night for the United Wrestling Association. In September 2007, while camping with his children at a Tennessee park, Morton was rearrested on the same charges. It was estimated he owed a remaining balance of $63,000. A website was established, and raised enough funds to secure his bail. Ricky currently operates School of Morton in Chuckey, Tennessee, where he lends his ring experience to all his students. He also still works the independent circuit and cameos in several films and videos.

Early career After graduating from Wilson Borough High School in 1957, Van Horne entered the drama department at the Richmond Professional Institute in Richmond, Virginia. While at the school he began hosting a Top 40 program at a local radio station, which led to his dropping out of school and starting a full-time broadcasting career in Roanoke, where he began calling high school football and basketball. This led in turn to Van Horne calling baseball for the Richmond Braves, the Class AAA affiliate of the Atlanta Braves, beginning in 1966.

He perished in the Neuengamme concentration camp in Northern Germany. Pfeffer was given the pseudonym Albert Dussel in Frank's diary, and remains known as such in many editions and adaptations of the publication.  Early life  Fritz Pfeffer was born in Gie√üen, Germany, one of the six children of Ignatz Pfeffer and Jeannette Hirsch-Pfeffer, who lived above their clothing and textiles shop at 6 Marktplatz in Giessen. After completing his education, Pfeffer trained as a dentist and jaw surgeon, obtained a license to practice in 1911 and opened a surgery the following year in Berlin. He served in the German army during the First World War. In 1926, Pfeffer married Vera Bythiner (31 March 1904 - 30 September 1942), who was born in Posen in Imperial Germany (now Pozna≈Ñ, Poland). The marriage produced a son, Werner Peter Pfeffer (3 April 1927 - 14 February 1995), but the couple divorced in 1932. Pfeffer was granted custody of the boy and raised him alone until November 1938, when the rising tide of Nazi activity in Germany persuaded him to send his son into the care of his brother, Ernst, in England. Werner Pfeffer emigrated to California in 1945 after his uncle's death and changed his name to Peter Pepper, later establishing a successful office supplies company under that name. The tide of antisemitism in Germany, which increased with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933, forced most of Pfeffer's relatives to flee the country. His mother had died in 1925, and his father remarried and remained in Germany, only to be arrested. He died in Theresienstadt in October 1942. Of Pfeffer's brothers, Julius had died in 1928, Emil emigrated to South Africa in 1937, Ernst moved to England and died in 1944 and Hans left for New Jersey. His sister Minna remained with their father in Germany and died in Nazi custody, and sister Vera escaped to the Netherlands but was arrested in 1942 and died in Auschwitz. In 1936, Fritz met a young woman, Charlotte Kaletta (1910-1985), born in Ilmenau, Thuringia in central Germany, who shared his history of a broken marriage. She was estranged from her first husband, Ludwig L√∂wenstein and had a son, Gustav, both of whom were deported on 26 September 1942Lfd. Nr. 804 und Lfd. Nr. 805 20.

Kristallnacht cemented the Pfeffers' decision to leave Berlin; they fled to Amsterdam in December 1938. They were there for two years before the German invasion, and subsequent anti- Jewish laws prohibiting cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews forced them to officially separate and register under different addresses. After establishing a dental practice in Amsterdam's Rivierenbuurt, Pfeffer became acquainted with the Van Pels and Frank families. Miep Gies met Pfeffer at one of the Franks' house parties and became a patient in his dental practice.  In hiding and afterwards  In the autumn of 1942, Pfeffer decided to go into hiding and asked Miep Gies about some suitable addresses. She consulted Otto Frank, whose family Gies had been hiding in secret rooms in the Franks' office building along with the Van Pels family. Frank agreed to accommodate Pfeffer, and he was taken into the hiding place on 16 November. Pfeffer's medical degree was valuable to the two families, as they could not contact a doctor while in hiding. Margot Frank moved into a room with her parents to allow Pfeffer to share a small room with Anne, beginning what would become a torturous relationship for both. It has been suggested by at least one biographer that Anne's extreme discomfort at sharing her room with a middle-aged man while she was going through puberty may have been at the root of her problems with Pfeffer, but the pressures of being in hiding and the generational differences of their forty-year age gap undoubtedly exacerbated the differences in their natures. Pfeffer felt his age gave him seniority over Anne and wrote off her writing activities as unimportant compared to his own studies. His observance of orthodox Judaism clashed with her liberal views. Her energy and capriciousness grated on his nerves, while his pedantry and rigidity frustrated her. Anne's irritations and growing dislike of Pfeffer led to complaints and derisory descriptions of him in her diary, against which his son Werner and wife Charlotte defended him once the book was published. The relationship of Anne and Fritz was the toughest of all. Pfeffer left a farewell note to his wife and they stayed in touch through Gies, who met her on a weekly basis to exchange their letters and take provisions from her. His letters never disclosed the location of his hiding place and Gies never revealed it, but on 4 August 1944, Pfeffer and the seven other occupants of the hiding place were arrested for deportation to Nazi concentration camps. With the rest of the group and two of their protectors, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, Pfeffer was taken to the Nazi headquarters in Amsterdam-South, then to a prison for three days before being transported to Westerbork on 8 August. Pfeffer was taken to the Punishment Barracks with the others, where he undertook hard labour, until he was selected for deportation to Auschwitz on 3 September. He was separated from the others on arrival on 6 September and sent to the men's barracks, where he was reunited with Otto Frank. On 29 October, he was transferred with 59 other medics to Sachsenhausen and from there to Neuengamme on an unknown date. In the infirmary there, Pfeffer died of enterocolitis at age 55 on 20 December 1944, according to the camp's records.  Posthumous reputation  Stolperstein, Lietzenburger Stra√üe 20b, Berlin- Sch√∂neberg, Germany According to research done by Melissa M√ºller for her book Anne Frank: The Biography, Charlotte Pfeffer married Fritz Pfeffer posthumously in 1950, with retrospective effect to 31 May 1937. She had become estranged from his son Werner, but both were united in their defense of Pfeffer after the publication of Anne Frank's diary in 1947, feeling that Frank's portrait of him‚Äîand of the pseudonym she had chosen for him, Mr. Dussel (German for \\"nitwit\\")‚Äîwas injurious to his memory. Otto Frank tried to placate them by reminding them of his daughter's youth and of her unflattering portraits of some of the other people in hiding. The subsequent exaggerations of this portrait in the 1955 play and 1959 film (in which Pfeffer was played by comic actor Ed Wynn) led Charlotte Pfeffer to contact screenwriters Albert Hackett and his wife Frances Goodrich to complain that they were libeling her deceased husband, who was depicted as ignorant about Jewish traditions. The Hacketts replied that their script did not mirror reality and that to inform a non-Jewish audience of the significance of Judaic ceremonies, one character had to be ignorant of them. Pfeffer pointed out that her husband was a devout Jew and master of Hebrew, but the character of \\"Mr. Dussel\\" remained unchanged. Embittered by the unrepresentative portrait, Charlotte Pfeffer severed her links with Otto Frank and Miep Gies as Anne Frank's fame grew in the decades after the war, and refused interview requests. Werner Pfeffer remained in touch with Otto Frank and had the opportunity to meet Gies shortly before dying of cancer in 1995, to thank her for her attempt to save his father's life. The meeting was recorded for the documentary film Anne Frank Remembered.Dir. Jon Blair, 1995. A collection of letters written by Fritz Pfeffer to his wife and a box of photographs of him were rescued, with some of Charlotte Pfeffer's possessions, from an Amsterdam flea market after her death in 1985. Ed Wynn's portrayal of Pfeffer (as Dussel) in George Stevens' film The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) earned him a nomination for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor.

DRM provides a way for content creators to set enforced limits on the use and duplication of their content by customers. The system is implemented on many recent phones. To date, two versions of OMA DRM have been released: OMA DRM 1.0 and OMA DRM 2.0. In order to ensure that all manufacturers' implementations of OMA DRM can work with each other, the Open Mobile Alliance provides specifications and test tools for OMA DRM. The OMA DRM group is chaired by Sergey Seleznev (Samsung Electronics). Versions =OMA DRM 1.0= OMA DRM version 1.0 was first drafted in November 2002, and approved in June 2004. It provides basic Digital Rights Management, without strong protection. The standard specifies three main methods: Forward Lock, Combined Delivery (combined rights object / media object), and Separate Delivery (separated rights object + encrypted media object). Forward Lock prevents the user from forwarding content such as ringtones and wallpapers on their phone. The content can be distributed using HTTP or MMS. =OMA DRM 2.0= Version 2.0 was drafted in July 2004 and approved in March 2006. The primary new feature is the extension of DRM 1.0's Separate Delivery mechanism. Each participating device in OMA DRM 2.0 has an individual DRM Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate, with a public key and the corresponding private key. Each Rights Object (RO) is individually protected for one receiving device by encrypting it with the device public key. The RO in turn contains the key that is used to decrypt the media object. Delivery of Rights Objects requires a registration with the Rights Issuer (the entity distributing Rights Objects). During this registration, the device certificate is usually validated against a device blacklist by means of an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) verification. Thus, devices known to be hacked can be excluded once they try to register with an Rights Issuer in order to receive new Rights Objects so they can access the content. =OMA SRM 1.0= Started in September 2005 and approved in March 2009, the goal of the Secure Removable Media (SRM) Work Item is to define the protection and consumption of digital content and associated usage rights on an SRM. An SRM is a removable medium that implements means to protect against unauthorized access to its internal data, such as a secure memory card or smart card. The SRM Work Item does not stand alone; it extends the existing OMA DRM 2.0 specifications. While OMA DRM 2.0 defines a general framework for downloading Rights to devices and sharing Rights in a domain, the SRM Work Item defines mechanisms and protocols for the SRM. It extends OMA DRM version 2.0 or 2.1, allowing users to move Rights between devices and SRMs, and to consume Rights stored in SRMs without generating and managing complex groups of devices in a domain. =OMA SRM 1.1= Started in December 2008 and approved in June 2011, SRM 1.1 is an extension of SRM 1.0 introducing such functions as content license move between two SRMs, direct license provisioning to SRM and support for OMA Broadcasting (OMA BCAST) tokens. Latter allows to turn SRM into a secure electronic wallet capable to store credits that are used to subscribe to mobile broadcast and multicast services. =OMA SCE 1.0= OMA SCE 1.0 started in September 2005 and was approved in December 2008 as a Candidate enabler. The goal of Secure Content Exchange (SCE) is to extend OMA DRM v2.0, enabling seamless sharing of purchased content between multiple devices, including all the devices owned by a subscriber (phone, PC, home electronics system, car audio system, etc.) and the temporary sharing of content on any device that is in close proximity to the subscriber‚Äôs device (e.g., a television set at a friend‚Äôs house or in a hotel room while the user is travelling). Because there will be no single DRM system deployed across all these different devices, the SCE also enhances the interoperability between OMA and non-OMA DRM systems, by defining an Import function for OMA DRM. Implementations and usage OMA DRM 1.0 has been implemented in over 550 models of mobile phone. Many mobile operatorse.g. Vodafone, SFR, Turkcell, Vivo, Orange) use OMA DRM for their content services. The first OMA DRM 2.0 implementations were released in early 2005; implementations were installed on mobile phones by the end of 2005. Software implementations for personal computer and PDA clients are also available. Most of the ringtones pre- installed on mobile phones have implemented DRM. Many commercial ringtone vendors who are not part of any mobile phone carrier do not bother with any form of DRM, perhaps because the number of ringtone vendors is huge, and people will choose to download unprotected ringtones if they can get them. The record industry does not mandate that DRM be implemented on ringtones, unlike most digital music stores. Many ringtones are reverse-engineered by the ringtone provider themselves, so it is their choice whether to implement the DRM. Since 2006, OMA has been working on DRM 2.0.1 and 2.1, and on new features such as SRM (Secure Removable Media) and SCE (Secure Content Exchange). Broadcast Services Security issues with DRM Profile Broadcast services requirements being completely different from video-on-demand, the OMA BCAST Smartcard profile has been recommended by all the industries to be the unified standard used for Mobile TV broadcast. =Providers/Implementations= Commercial OMA DRM providers include: * Authentec * castLabs mobile TV Service Delivery Platform * Discretix * Irdeto * Mutable OMA DRM * NDS * Philips * Saffron Digital * Viaccess An open source solution for OMA DRM 2.0 is also available.http://sourceforge.net/projects/openipmp openIPMP =Licensing format= The OMA DRM specification uses a profile of the Open Digital Rights Language for expressing its licenses.ODRL Initiative Determining that a file is OMA protected =Nokia Series 40= On Nokia Series 40 phones, an installed file with DRM will have its \\"Send\\" option greyed out in its options menu. If the user attempts to send such a file via MMS, a message stating \\"The file is copyright protected\\" will appear. A Bluetooth file transfer will fail if the user tries to extract the file using Bluetooth, yet the file will still appear as present, and will still be deletable via Bluetooth. However, if the file (such as a music track) is received with separate delivery‚Äîthe key is sent separately from the actual download of the file, and the file contains a license URL‚Äîit is possible to forward the file to other devices. Once the file is activated on the new device, it will prompt the user to access the URL embedded in the file, and give the user the option to acquire the key. Criticism Some vendors implement broad DRM systems, restricting consumer rights beyond the scope documented by the OMA DRM standards. For example, some Nokia Symbian-based devicesat least the Nokia 6680 and 6681; possibly many others will completely refuse to send all files of certain types*.mid, *.jar, *.jad and *.sis files over Bluetooth. For these phones, this blocks sending of MIDI files, Java Applets, and Symbian programs regardless of whether or not they are protected by DRM. Such phones will refuse any attempts to send such files with the message \\"Unable to send protected objects\\" or a similar error. This prevents sending such content, even when the content license explicitly allows or even depends on redistribution.

Information may be new, just introduced into the conversation; given, already active in the speakers' consciousness; or old, no longer active.

Information flow affects grammatical structures such as: *word order (topic, focus, and afterthought constructions). *active, passive, or middle voice. *choice of deixis, such as articles; \\"medial\\" deictics such as Spanish ese and Japanese sore are generally determined by the familiarity of a referent rather than by physical distance. *overtness of information, such as whether an argument of a verb is indicated by a lexical noun phrase, a pronoun, or not mentioned at all. *Clefting: Splitting a single clause into two clauses, each with its own verb, e.g. ‚ÄòThe chicken turtles tasted like chicken.‚Äô becomes ‚ÄòIt was the chicken turtle  that tasted like chicken.‚Äô In this case, clefting is used to shift the focus of the sentence to the subject, chicken turtle. *Front Focus: Placing at the start (front) of a sentence information that would normally occur later in the sentence, to give it extra prominence.

His career is of particular interest because he was among political figures such as Joseph Fouch√© who at first aggressively supported the Terror, only to betray its leaders (including Maximilien Robespierre) and support the various conservative reactionary r√©gimes that followed. His was a chevalier de l'Empire from 22 November 1808 and a baron de l'Empire from 31 January 1810. Early life and mandates Born in Nancy, Lorraine, the son of a lawyer, he was brought up in his father's profession. During the first phase of the French Revolution under the National Assembly he was appointed (1790) procureur-syndic of the district of Pont-√†-Mousson in his home department of Meurthe. French Revolution Elected (31 August 1791) as a representative of the D√©partement of Meurthe to the Legislative Assembly (1791‚Äì1792), and then again elected (4 September 1792) to the National Convention (1792‚Äì1795) as a deputy for Meurthe. For Convention he was appointed a member of the committee for finances, and briefly was appointed to the Committee of Public Safety (27 June 1793 ‚Äì 10 July 1793) by resolution of the National Convention to present his plan for food procurement, but did not join the committee's sessions. Mallarm√© attached himself to the Montagnard faction and voted for the death sentence in the trial of Louis XVI. He served as President of the National Convention (30 May 1793 ‚Äì 13 June 1793) and presided over the debates about proscription of the Girondin faction, rivals of the Montagnards, but vacated the chair at vital moments. Mallarm√© did not chair the evening meeting of 1 June 1793 (Henri Gr√©goire presided) and chaired only the first part of the session of 2 June 1793, when Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles replaced him in chair until the end of the session. Terror He served on several missions, including to the Departments of Meurthe, Vosges and Haute-Sa√¥ne (23 August 1793 ‚Äì 3 November 1793) which was in support of the lev√©e en masse, to the army of the Rhine (13 September 1793 - 3 November 1793), and again over winter 1793-1794 to establish revolutionary government in Meuse and Moselle. While on the latter mission he earned a notorious reputation for senseless arrests and executions. The most heinous example is when he ordered the execution of the sentence of death decreed by the Revolutionary Tribunal on some young girls at Verdun who had offered flowers to the Prussian soldiers when they entered the town. He thus joined the ranks of Tallien, Fr√©ron, and Fouch√© as perpetrators of the worst excesses of Terror, and like them found his position growing tenuous. He secured his survival when he spoke against Maximilien Robespierre in the course of the Thermidorian coup (27 July 1794). Thermidorian Reaction In the reactionary political order that followed the demise of Robespierre, Mallarm√© was sent on mission to Haute-Garonne and Gers (21 August 1794 - 23 October 1794, 6 November 1794 - 15 January 1795). It was an entirely different part of France than he had been involved with heretofore, and similarly, he pursued a very different set of goals, closing down the terrorist Jacobin clubs and setting free prisoners who had been locked away during the Terror as enemies of the state. Alas, his own terrorist activities caught up with him and he was denounced and arrested (1 June 1795), but he was released soon after the amnesty of 26 October 1795. Directory, Consulate, and Empire In 1796 he was appointed by the Directory commissioner for the organization of the d√©partements of Dyle and Mont-Tonnerre. Under the Empire, Mallarm√© was collector of the droits r√©unis (sales taxes) at Nancy, and lost his money in 1814 in raising the lev√©e of volunteers. Appointed sous-pr√©fet of Avesnes during the Hundred Days, he was imprisoned by the Prussian authorities in revenge for the death of the maidens of Verdun, and held for six months in Wesel. He took refuge in Brussels and then Mechelen (with the Cellite monks), and remained in exile during the Bourbon Restoration. He died in Mechelen.

The Source is a unit of 4458729 Canada Inc. and is based in Barrie, Ontario. Background Promenade. The Source began as the Canadian branch of Radio Shack (later \\"RadioShack\\"). The chain was originally owned by Radio Shack's American parent company Tandy Corporation, but was spun off in June 1986, along with the rest of Tandy's international operations, as InterTAN. A licensing agreement with what became RadioShack Corporation allowed InterTAN to continue to use the chain's name and logo. InterTAN abandoned its non- profitable West German stores in 1987, left Belgium and France in 1993, sold its British stores to Carphone Warehouse in 1999 and sold its Australian stores to Woolworth subsidiary Dick Smith Electronics in 2002, leaving just the Canadian Radio Shack, Battery Plus, and Rogers Plus stores. In May 2004, InterTAN was acquired by Circuit City. One week after the acquisition was completed, RadioShack Corporation filed a lawsuit in the 352nd Judicial District Court in Tarrant County, Texas, to end the licensing agreement. RadioShack Corporation claimed that InterTAN had breached the terms of their agreement. On March 24, 2005, the district court judge ruled in favour of RadioShack and cancelled the agreement. The ruling prohibited InterTAN from using the brand name on its stores or in any of its products, packaging, and advertising after June 30, 2005. On April 26, 2005, Circuit City announced that the stores would be renamed The Source by Circuit City (La Source par Circuit City in Quebec). The rebranding process was completed in the majority of the chain's Canadian stores by July 1, 2005. The chain also introduced new house brands, including Nexxtech and Vital, in place of RadioShack store brands. In February 2007, The Source announced it would close down 62 low volume stores across Canada. On March 30, 2007, Circuit City announced to its shareholders that it was seeking options including selling off the InterTAN/The Source subsidiary to cut losses. On November 10, 2008, InterTAN sought protection from its creditors, after Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Hoarding or caching in animal behavior is the storage of food in locations hidden from the sight of both conspecifics (animals of the same or closely related species) and members of other species.Vander Wall, Stephen B. (1990) Food Hoarding in Animals. University of Chicago Press. Most commonly, the function of hoarding or caching is to store food in times of surplus for times when food is less plentiful. However, there is evidence that some amount of caching or hoarding is done in order to ripen the food, called ripening caching. The term hoarding is most typically used for rodents, whereas caching is more commonly used in reference to birds, but the behaviors in both animal groups are quite similar. Hoarding is done either on a long-term basis ‚Äì cached on a seasonal cycle, with food to be consumed months down the line ‚Äì or on a short term basis, in which case the food will be consumed over a period of one or several days. Some common animals that cache their food are rodents such as hamsters and squirrels, and many different bird species, such as rooks and woodpeckers. The western scrub jay is noted for its particular skill at caching. There are two types of caching behavior: larder-hoarding, where a species creates a few large caches which it often defends, and scatter-hoarding, where a species will create multiple caches, often with each individual food item stored in a unique place. Both types of caching have their advantage.  Function  Caching behavior is typically a way to save excess edible food for later consumption - either soon to be eaten food, such as when a jaguar hangs a partially eaten prey in a tree to be eaten within a few days, or long term where the food is hidden and retrieved many months later. Caching is a common adaptation to seasonal changes in food availability. In regions where winters are harsh, food availability typically becomes low, and caching food during the times of high food availability in the warmer months provides a significant survival advantage. For species that hoard perishable food weather can significantly affect the accumulation, use and rotting of the stored food. This phenomenon is referenced in the fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. However, in ripening caching behavior, animals collect and cache food which is immediately inedible but will become \\"ripe\\" and edible after a short while. For instance, tayras (a Central American weasel) have been observed to harvest whole green plantains, hide them, and then come back to eat them after they have ripened. Leafcutter ants harvest pieces of inedible leaves and then cache them in underground chambers to ripen with a fungus which is the main food for the colony. Contrary to popular belief, there is no scientific evidence that crocodilians such as the American Alligator cache large prey underwater to consume later.  Hoard distribution and size  Scatter hoarding is the formation of a large number of small hoards. This behavior is present in both birds (especially the Canada jay) and small mammals, mainly squirrels and other rodents, such as the eastern gray squirrel, fox squirrel, and wood mouse. Specifically, those who do not migrate to warmer climates or hibernate for winter are most likely to scatter hoard.Thorington, R.W., Jr., Koprowski, J.L., Steele, M.A., and Whatton, J. (2012) Squirrels of the World. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 472 pp. This behavior plays an important part in seed dispersal, as those seeds that are left uneaten will have a chance to germinate, thus enabling plants to spread their populations effectively. Cache spacing is the primary technique that scatter hoarders use to protect food from pilferers. By spreading the food supply around geographically, hoarders discourage competitors who happen upon a cache from conducting area-restricted searching for more of the supply. Despite cache spacing, however, hoarders are still unable to completely eliminate the threat of pilferage.Hampton, R. R. & Sherry, D. F. (1994) The effects of cache loss on choice of cache sites in the black-capped chickadee. Behav. Ecol. 5:44-50 However, having multiple cache sites is costly because it requires a good memory. Scatter-hoarders generally have a large hippocampus. In larder hoarding, the hoard is large and is found in a single place termed a larder, which usually also serves as the nest where the animal lives. Hamsters are famous larder hoarders. Indeed, the German verb \\"hamstern\\" (to hoard) is derived from the noun \\"Hamster\\" which refers to the rodent; similar verbs are found in various related languages (Dutch hamsteren, and Swedish hamstra). Other languages also draw a clear connection between hamsters and hoarding: Polish chomikowaƒá, from chomik ‚Äì hamster; Hebrew hamster; oger (◊ê◊ï◊í◊®) comes from to hoard; le'egor (◊ú◊ê◊í◊ï◊®). A disadvantage of larder hoarding is that if a cache is raided, this is far more problematic for the animal than if it were a scatter hoarder. While the hoard is much easier to remember the location of, these larger hoards must also be more staunchly defended.  Related behaviors  =Guarding= Most species are particularly wary of onlooking individuals during caching and ensure that the cache locations are secret.Heinrich, B. & Pepper, J. W. (1998) Influence of competitors on caching behavior in the common raven, Corvus corax. Anim. Behav. 56:1083-1090 Not all caches are concealed however, for example shrikes store prey items on thorns on branches in the open. =Shared or individual hoarding= Although a small handful of species share food stores, food hoarding is a solo endeavor for most species, including almost all rodents and birds. For example, a number of jays live in large family groups, but they don't demonstrate sharing of cached food. Rather, they hoard their food supply selfishly, caching and retrieving the supply in secret.Waite, T.A., (1992). Gray jay scatterhoarding behavior, rate maximization and the effect of local cache density. Ornis. Scand., 23: 175-182 There are only two species in which kin selection has resulted in a shared food store, i.e. beavers (Castor canadensis) and acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorous); the former live in family groups and construct winter larders of submerged branches, while the latter are unusual in that they construct a conspicuous communal larder.Koenig, W.D. and Mumme, R.L., (1987). Population Ecology of the Cooperatively Breeding Acorn Woodpecker. Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press. 0691084645 =Pilfering= Pilferage occurs when one animal takes food from another animal's larder. Some species experience high levels of cache pilferage, up to 30% of the supply per day. Models of scatter hoarding suggested the value of cached food is equal to the hoarders ability to retrieve it. =Reciprocal pilfering= It has been observed that members of certain species, such as rodents and chickadees, act as both hoarder and pilferer. In other words, pilfering can be reciprocal and, thus, tolerable. Although this kind of food caching system seems cooperative, it has been suggested that it is actually driven by the selfish interests of the individual. =Recaching= Animals recache the food that they've pilfered from other animal's caches. For example, 75% percent of mildly radioactive (thus traceable) Jeffrey pine seeds cached by yellow pine chipmunks were found in two cache sites, 29% of the seeds were found in three sites, 9.4% were found in four sites and 1.3% were found in five sites over a 3-month period. These results, and those from other studies, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the food supplies of scatter hoarding animals. =Deception= Group-foraging common ravens, (Corvus corax), scatter hoard their food and also raid the caches made by others. Cachers withdraw from conspecifics when hiding their food and most often place their caches behind structures, obstructing the view of potential observers. Raiders watch inconspicuously and keep at a distance to cachers close to their cache sites. In response to the presence of potential raiders or because of their initial movements towards caches, the cachers frequently interrupt caching, change cache sites, or recover their food items. These behaviors suggest that ravens are capable of withholding information about their intentions, which may qualify as tactical deception. Similarly, Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) when being watched by another jay, prefer to cache food behind an opaque barrier rather than a transparent barrier, suggesting they may opt to cache in out-of-view locations to reduce the likelihood of other jays pilfering their caches.

Generally, two or more waves are combined and as the phase difference between them varies, the power or intensity (probability or population in quantum mechanics) of the resulting wave oscillates, forming an interference pattern. The pattern may be visible all at once because the phase difference varies as a function of space, as in a 2-slit experiment. Alternately, the phase difference may be manually controlled by the operator, for example by adjusting a vernier knob in an interferometer. The ratio of the size or amplitude of these oscillations to the sum of the powers of the individual waves is defined as the visibility. The interferometric visibility gives a practical way to measure the coherence of two waves (or one wave with itself). A theoretical definition of the coherence is given by the degree of coherence, using the notion of correlation. Visibility in optics In linear optical interferometers (like the Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometer, Michelson interferometer, and Sagnac interferometer), interference manifests itself as intensity oscillations over time or space, also called fringes. Under these circumstances, the interferometric visibility is also known as the \\"Michelson visibility\\" http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/FringeVisibility.html or the \\"fringe visibility.\\" For this type of interference, the sum of the intensities (powers) of the two interfering waves equals the average intensity over a given time or space domain. The visibility is written as: : u=A/\\\\bar{I}, in terms of the amplitude envelope of the oscillating intensity and the average intensity: :A=(I_\\\\max-I_\\\\min)/2, :\\\\bar{I}=(I_\\\\max+I_\\\\min)/2. So it can be rewritten as: : u=\\\\frac{I_\\\\max- I_\\\\min}{I_\\\\max+I_\\\\min}, where Imax is the maximum intensity of the oscillations and Imin the minimum intensity of the oscillations. If the two optical fields are ideally monochromatic (consist of only single wavelength) point sources of the same polarization, then the predicted visibility will be : u=\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}}{I_1+I_2}, where I_1 and I_2 indicate the intensity of the respective wave. Any dissimilarity between the optical fields will decrease the visibility from the ideal. In this sense, the visibility is a measure of the coherence between two optical fields. A theoretical definition for this is given by the degree of coherence. This definition of interference directly applies to the interference of water waves and electric signals. Visibility in a Mach‚ÄìZehnder, Michelson or Sagnac interferometer. Visibility is similarly defined in double-slit interference. However, now the max and min vary across the interference pattern. The example shows a visibility of 80% (i.e. 0.8). Visibility in quantum mechanics Since the Schr√∂dinger equation is a wave equation and all objects can be considered waves in quantum mechanics, interference is ubiquitous. Some examples: Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates can exhibit interference fringes. Atomic populations show interference in a Ramsey interferometer. Photons, atoms, electrons, neutrons, and molecules have exhibited interference in double-slit interferometers. Visibility in Hong‚ÄìOu‚ÄìMandel interference. At large delays the photons do not interfere. At zero delays, the detection of coincident photon pairs is suppressed.

Another option is to replace a large combustion engine with an electric motor and a small combustion engine, creating a hybrid electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The general trend appears to be that ground vehicles will \\"go electric,\\" and automakers have responded to public demand by producing both hybrid electric vehicles which get gasoline, and electric vehicles which get similar or better mileage by mpg equivalent efficiency rating. In general, commercially- manufactured electric vehicles are inhibited by the limited range per charge of batteries (up to ), battery charge times that are slower than gasoline filling times, apparent greater initial cost over combustion engines, and potentially high service costs for used or worn-out batteries. Electric conversions are often inhibited by either the difficult labor and specialized knowledge involved in a do-it-yourself (DIY) conversion, or the expense of a purchased conversion service with conversion components, often costing . There is a small but steadily growing DIY community for electric conversions.  Elements of a conversionAlmost any vehicle can be converted to electric. Many people prefer to pick a vehicle that is light and aerodynamic in order to maximize distance traveled per battery charge. There must also be adequate room and load capacity for batteries. * If obtaining a vehicle for conversion, choose a car which has an undamaged body (unless also doing the body work). *The battery pack, which provides a source of electrical power. The most commonly available and affordable batteries are lead-acid flooded type. Next are the AGM (Absorption Glass Mat) sealed maintenance free batteries, a little more powerful and expensive. Then there are the more exotic batteries like Ni- MH and Li-ion; more difficult to find but light and longer lasting, maintenance free, and much more expensive. The new lithium batteries are showing some promise for EVs in the near future. *The charger which restores energy to the batteries (which may be mounted within the vehicle or at a special charging station at some fixed location) *The power controller, which regulates the flow of energy between the battery and the electric motor(s), controlled by an electronic throttle. *One or more electric motors and their mechanical attachment to the driveline *Power conductors connecting the battery, controller, and motor(s) *Accessory equipment to power auxiliary equipment such as power brakes and heating system *Control circuitry and equipment to allow control and interlocking of the various components *Instrumentation specific to the operation and maintenance of the conversion Hobbyists and conversions Eliica prototype The full electric Formula Student car of the Eindhoven University of Technology Hobbyists often build their own EVs by converting existing production cars to run solely on electricity. There is a cottage industry supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists. Universities such as the University of California, Irvine even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch. Short-range battery electric vehicles can offer the hobbyist comfort, utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range EVs may be built using high-performance lead‚Äìacid batteries, using about half the mass needed for a range. The result is a vehicle with about a range, which, when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear), does not require power steering, offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, and is freeway capable and legal. But their EVs are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries. By including a manual transmission, short-range EVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed EVs developed by major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for neighborhood electric vehicles, short-range EVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways (where speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short \\"slow-lane\\" on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas. Faced with chronic fuel shortage on the Gaza Strip, Palestinian electrical engineer Waseem Othman al-Khozendar invented in 2008 a way to convert his car to run on 32 electric batteries. According to al-Khozendar, the batteries can be charged with worth of electricity to drive from . After a 7-hour charge, the car should also be able to run up to a speed of . In 2008, several Chinese manufacturers began marketing lithium iron phosphate () batteries directly to hobbyists and vehicle conversion shops. These batteries offered much better power-to-weight ratios allowing vehicle conversions to typically achieve per charge. Prices gradually declined to approximately per kW¬∑h by mid-2009. As the cells feature life ratings of 3,000 cycles, compared to typical lead acid battery ratings of 300 cycles, the life expectancy of cells is around 10 years. cells require more expensive battery management and charging systems than lead acid batteries. Solar power On-board solar cells can be used to power an electric vehicle. The small power generated by solar cells mounted on a vehicle means that the other components in the system must be special to compensate for this. Conversion process Most conversions in North America are performed by hobbyists who typically will convert a well used vehicle with a non-functioning engine, since such defective vehicles can be quite inexpensive to purchase. Other hobbyists with larger budgets may prefer to convert a later model vehicle, or a vehicle of a particular type. In some cases, the vehicle itself may be built by the converter, or assembled from a kit car. A two-stage vehicle is a vehicle that has been built by two separate manufacturers. The result is a standard, complete vehicle. In this process, vehicles may be converted by a manufacturer (as was done by Ford Motor Company to create the Ford Ranger EV). Alternatively, in a process known as \\"third- party (power)trainization\\", an independent converter will purchase new vehicle glidersVehicle analysis, pg 14 (vehicles without a motor or related equipment) and then perform the conversion, to offer a two-stage vehicle. In some countries, the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no installation costs (it is called pre-conversion or previous conversion). Industry The electric vehicle conversion industry has grown to include conversion car garages, aftermarket kits and vehicle components. Some companies focus specifically on certain classic cars (i.e. VW Beetle, Rolls- Royce, Jaguar, Citro√´n H Van, ...)Buyers won't have to choose between classic cars and the environmentCitro√´n HY conversion Vehicle types =Electric bicycle= A bicycle with an aftermarket hub-motor in the front wheel An electric bicycle is a conventional bicycle that has been fitted with an electric motor. Most often electric bicycles or \\"e-bikes\\" are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels, fuel cells, gas generators or other alternative energy sources. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture a small amount of energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills (regenerative braking). Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself (immediate start) if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller, while others require the rider to pedal at all times (pedal assist). This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind (See motorized bicycle). Many battery technologies are available for powering electric bikes. The most common and least expensive battery technology is sealed lead acid but LiFePO4 is fast becoming the battery of choice for the e-bike. Converting one's bike to electric with a conversion kit is an easy and affordable solution for most people interested in learning more about electric vehicle conversion. Image:Trotmcar.JPGElectric scooter Image:EVMotorCycleFrankendragon.jpgCustom drag bike Image:Solarbikemiturl.jpgSolar cruiser Registration of converted and newly constructed vehicles =United States= The ease of registration will vary by state. Some states require safety inspections, usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials. In any case, for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating ‚Äì turn signals, brake lights, headlights, horn, etc. The windshield should have no running cracks (small stone chips and \\"stars\\" may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision). If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle (a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited) inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts. Registration procedures will vary by state and will usually be more difficult in states with strict emissions requirements. On the other hand, changing the registration allows a conversion to qualify for tax incentives available in some states, such as Oregon, for either the vehicle, the charging system, or both. California (US) conversion registration and taxation Registration of a converted existing, or newly self-constructed electric vehicle in California is no longer difficult. This falls into two categories; First, if the vehicle is built from new frame components and possibly some salvage parts, (i.e., it has never been a previously titled motorcar previously, but it has brakes or axles that were obtained used/rebuilt.) In California if you \\"create\\" a car from scratch and want to register and title it with DMV, you need to go through the \\"Specially Constructed Vehicle Emission Control Program\\" or SPCNS for short, this is also called California \\"SB100\\" program. Or Second, a previously registered vehicle converted to electric propulsion. SPCNC: In the past, the process of registering an SPCNS vehicle required meeting with an outside referee at a community college or one of the states mobile referee stations to verify the vehicle. The current process happens at the DMV with the inspection being done by A DMV inspector. The inspector will need to be able to see the motor and batteries and verify that there in no internal combustion engine. The vehicle will still need a brake and light inspection By an outside inspector to verify its compliance with other vehicle codes. Currently Registered Vehicles: If you are converting an existing vehicle and it is older than 1975, you may opt to not bother to get the vehicle converted to the \\"E\\" code unless you are looking for the Diamond Lane stickers, since these vehicles don't require a smog inspection. For vehicles newer than 1975 you will need to go the DMV and have the vehicle inspected as a conversion. The batteries and motor will have to be exposed so the inspector can see them and verify that there is no internal combustion engine. The next step requires the clerk at the local California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office to call the Sacramento office. Only the Sacramento office can make this entry into the computer system. If the local clerk tries, the system will default to the \\"Q\\" code for hybrid. (These procedures are in place to inhibit fraudulent registration of ICE vehicles as Electric in order to avoid smog inspections.) A hybrid is not exempt from smog inspection. Before you leave the DMV make sure your printout has the proper \\"E\\" code or you will have to go back to do it again. There is weight fee of $87 for vehicles under or $266 for vehicles from . This is in addition to any regular registration fees. =Spain= In Spain, the conversion (called transformation) is regulated by Real Decreto 866/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se regula la tramitaci√≥n de las reformas de veh√≠culos.

The reservation forms the land base for the federally recognized Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, one of six bands comprising the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, organized in 1934. The Leech Lake Reservation has the highest population of any reservation in Minnesota, with a resident population of 10,660 indicated by the 2010 United States census. Geography and demographics The reservations of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. As of the 2010 census, the reservation had a population of 10,660, making it the largest in the state by number of residents. As the reservation covers 972.517 sq mi (2,518.806 km¬≤) of land and 337.392 sq mi (873.841 km¬≤) of water, about one-fourth of its territory is covered by lakes. The largest lakes on the reservation are Leech Lake, Lake Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake. The band uses 40 lakes for the production of wild rice, and the community produces more rice than any other reservation in the state. The reservation is the second-largest in Minnesota (after the White Earth Indian Reservation) in terms of land area, and the largest in terms of total area. The core areas of the reservation were established by the 1855 treaty of Washington, which formed three smaller reservations for the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians, and modified several times thereafter. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the present \\"Greater\\" Leech Lake Indian Reservation was formed from the merger of the Leech Lake, Cass Lake, and Lake Winnibigoshish reservations of the Pillager Band, the Chippewa Indian Reservation of the Lake Superior Band, and the White Oak Point reservation of the Mississippi Band. A minimal percentage of reservation land is owned by citizens of the Band; additionally, most of the reservation land is now within the Chippewa National Forest, making settlement expansion extremely difficult. The reservation consists of eleven villages; two additional communities have a substantial number of Leech Lake Band members. Nearly all Leech Lake communities are located in or near the woods of the Chippewa National Forest. The largest community is Cass Lake, situated on the southwestern shores of the eponymous lake.

On April 16, 1994, an average of 65,000 Tutsis traveled to the school. Once the victims arrived, no water or food was provided. This was done to ensure the people were too weak to resist. After defending themselves for a few days using stones, the Tutsi were overrun on April 21. The French soldiers disappeared and the school was attacked by Hutu Interahamwe militiamen. Some 45,000 Tutsi were murdered at the school, and almost all of those who managed to escape were killed the next day when they tried to hide in a nearby church. According to the guide at the memorial, the French brought in heavy equipment to dig several pits where many thousands of bodies were placed. They then placed a volleyball court over the mass graves in an attempt to hide what happened. Among the bodies currently displayed are those of children and infants. Only 34 people are thought to have survived the massacre in Murambi. The memorial was founded on 21 April 1995. The site contains 50,000 graves.Murambi Memorial, GencideArchiveRwanda.org, Retrieved 3 March 2016 The school building is now a genocide museum exhibiting the skeletons and mummified bodies of some of the thousands of people killed in Gikongoro Province in 1994.

While the Cal Band is student-run, it is administered under the auspices of the university and represents Cal at sporting events and social gatherings. The name of the band is \\"The University of California Band\\" by the constitution, but is typically called \\"The University of California Marching Band\\" or \\"The Cal Band\\". When the band marches out of Memorial Stadium's North Tunnel for football pre-games, it is referred to as \\"The Pacesetter of College Marching Bands, the Pride of California\\". Student-run Unlike most other collegiate marching bands, the Cal Band is not under the University's Department of Music but rather the Department of Student Musical Activities, with other student- led organizations such as the University of California Jazz Ensembles and University of California Choral Ensembles. The Band is entirely student-run, save for one University-paid employee, its Director. Five students, each heading a specific point of leadership within the band‚Äîthe Drum Major, Student Director, Executive Secretary, Public Relations Director, and Senior Manager‚Äîare elected by their peers and serve for terms of one calendar year. The five student leaders and the Director form the Executive Committee. The Senior Manager, who is the band's formal liaison with the university, is elected by the previous Executive Committee. All the other student Executive Committee positions are elected by a majority vote of the Band membership. Unlike other major collegiate bands, students run rehearsals, pick the songs, chart shows, arrange trips, and handle promotions through committee vote. This allows members to build their resumes and gain work experience. As of the fall of 2017, the Band has 244 members (no color guard or auxiliary). After Robert Calonico's retirement in June 2018, Dr. Matthew Sadowski was named the University's new director of bands. History The Cal Band has its roots in the University Cadet Band established in 1891. In 1923, the Band was sponsored by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) and its student leadership structure was formalized two years later. In the early years (prior to 1971), various faculty from the Music department were appointed director of the band through an arrangement with the ASUC. After the 1950 Rose Bowl against Ohio State University, the Cal Band decided to adopt its present chair step marching style after they discovered their performance looked lackluster in comparison to Ohio State's marching band. It is one of only three bands in the Pac-12 (the others being the Spirit of Troy and the University of Washington Husky Marching Band), and one of the few outside the Big Ten Conference, to use this physically demanding style. The Straw Hat Band, a subset of the Cal Band, was also established that same year. After Professor Cushing (director from 1934 to 1950) resigned, the Music Department was asked to provide the ASUC with a new Director for the Band. Coincidentally, James Berdahl (Student Director in 1938) was returning to Berkeley to work on his doctoral studies in music. The Music Department Chairman, Albert Elkus, convinced Berdahl to serve as acting Director of the Cal Band until the department could find a permanent replacement for Professor Cushing. Berdahl became permanent Director of the Cal Band at the end of the 1951 season, and remained in that position until 1971. In the fall of 1968, Dr. David W. Tucker (Ph.D, Cal, 1969) was hired as arranger and composer. He was appointed Associate Director in 1969. His responsibilities with the Cal Band included rehearsing, auditioning prospective new members, and directing on the football field opposite director James Berdahl. For the 1971 season, during Berdahl‚Äôs sabbatical year in Japan, Tucker was named Acting Director. At the end of the 1971 season, Tucker left the Cal Band to accept the newly created position of Director of the University of California Jazz Ensembles, after having been the volunteer director since 1969. During the 1971 season, substantial podium time was taken by Assistant Director Robert O. Briggs. He was appointed acting director in 1972, and was made director in 1973. In the 1970s, the Band's leadership structure was reorganized, a new band constitution written, and sponsorship moved from ASUC to the University. In the Spring Quarter of 1973, the all-male band voted to admit women, in the face of Title IX sanctions against the University, which was now the Band's primary funding source. There were fewer than 10 dissenting votes, against more than 100 votes in favor of admitting women. In the Fall 1973 marching season, 23 woman marched, together with 120 men. Although they rehearsed, marched and performed with the Band beginning in 1973, women were not entirely accepted by the Band's \\"inner fellowship\\" until through attrition the dissenting all-male band veterans had rotated out of the Band. More recently, the Band's membership has consisted of an even split of men and women, thus successfully broadening and improving the performance repertory possible for the Band's live performances. In 1993, the Cal Band History Committee published a comprehensive history of the Cal Band. While this volume is now out of print, the text of the History Book can be found online at Cal Band History Book Director Emeritus Robert O. Briggs died in 2008, leaving a legacy of musicianship spanning two generations of musicians. Performances The Cal Band has been seen and heard at a variety of performance venues. In the recent past, the Cal Band has appeared at the San Francisco Symphony's \\"Black and White Ball,\\" performed for such names as George Shultz (former U.S. Secretary of State), Peter E. Haas and family (UC Berkeley benefactors and the owners of Levi Strauss & Co.), and George Lucas. In addition, the Cal Band has been seen on \\"The Ed Sullivan Show,\\" the nationally syndicated game show \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" Santa Rosa TV 50's morning program, KTVU Channel 2's \\"Mornings on Two,\\" KRON Channel 4's newscasts, \\"Bay Area Backroads,\\" and sportscaster Vernon Glen's \\"Mr. Involvement.\\" The Cal Band sound has been heard on dozens of Bay Area radio stations, such as WiLD 94.9 and KMEL 106.1, Live 105, and K101, and rounds out its exposure on the pages of numerous Bay Area newspapers. In 2010, 2012, and 2014, the band also led the San Francisco Giants victory parade in downtown San Francisco. In 2016, the band played alongside Coldplay, Beyonc√©, and Bruno Mars in the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. On May 18, 2016, the Cal Band traveled to Beijing, China and performed at the Juyongguan Pass section of the Great Wall. Wintertime activities include playing at various on campus sporting events and trips to play at various ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe region. Before 2002, in the spring, the Band performed a traditional \\"Spring Show\\" in UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, combining the marching and playing talents of the band with other, hidden talents usually reserved for off the football field. Spring Show was discontinued in 2002 after financial burdens to the band resulting from funding cuts to the University of California system. In 2009, the Spring Show was brought back, to be discontinued again after the spring of 2011. In a different sort of performance, the Cal Band was asked to help with the Nobel Lecture by George Smoot in 2006 by recreating \\"The Big Bang.\\" Cal Band reenacts the Big Bang, with direction by Nobelist George SmootNobelist-George- Smoot-Directs-Big-Bang-with-Cal-Band-12-06 Football Performances The Cal Band performs during a pre-game show During weeks of home football games the Cal Band gives several performances. On Fridays before a game, the Cal Band plays at the noon rallies on Sproul Plaza. On game days the Cal Band gives a concert on Sproul Plaza an hour and a half before kickoff. Following this performance, the Band marches in formation to California Memorial Stadium, leading a procession of Cal alumni and fans. During home football games the band gives a pre-game show, a half time show,Cal band shows its love of video games from the Tech Chronicles Blog of the San Francisco Chronicle and typically a musical performance after the game as the crowd leaves. During the game, the band is seated to the left of the primary student section, and plays stand songs, as well as fight songs throughout the game. A \\"break off\\" band performed in the front of each major section during the third quarter prior to the 2012 renovation of California Memorial Stadium. In 2017, the band played alongside University of Washington Husky Marching Band in their ‚ÄúTribute to Horn Bands‚Äù show, featuring music from The Blues Brothers, Tower of Power, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Chicago (band). In the Bleacher Report's power ranking of the top 25 college marching band pregames shows and traditions, the Cal Band was named 9th (of 25) as having a show that \\"beckons [the] former glory days, full of school songs and traditional formations\\" and is \\"a stand-alone classic\\".Power Ranking the Top 25 College Marching Band Pregame Shows Instrumentation The Cal Band uses a fairly standard military band instrumentation with glockenspiels, piccolos, clarinets, alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, trombones, baritones, sousaphones, snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and cymbals. California Alumni Band The California Alumni Band, usually shorted to Cal Alumni Band, is a marching band consisting of former Cal Band members. The Cal Alumni Band is run by the non-profit Cal Band Alumni Association and is a subset of the Cal Alumni Association, an organization that handles alumni affairs of the University of California, Berkeley.

The first concerns traditional grammar, which tends to view a predicate as one of two main parts of a sentence, the other part being the subject. In the sentence Bill heard Fred, the predicate is heard Fred. On this approach, the purpose of the predicate is to complete an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like. The second notion is derived from work in predicate calculus and first order logic and is prominent in modern theories of syntax and grammar. The predicate of a sentence corresponds to the main verb (and potentially to any auxiliary verbs that accompany the main verb); whereas the arguments of that predicate (e.g. the subject and object noun phrases) are outside the predicate. On this approach, the predicate in the sentence Bill heard Fred is just the verb heard. The competition between these two notions has generated confusion concerning the use of the term predicate in general. This article considers both of these notions. In traditional grammar The predicate in traditional grammar is inspired by propositional logic of antiquity (as opposed to the more modern predicate logic). A predicate is seen as a property that a subject has or is characterized by. A predicate is therefore an expression that can be true of something. Thus, the expression \\"is moving\\" is true of anything that is moving. This classical understanding of predicates was adopted more or less directly into Latin and Greek grammars; and from there, it made its way into English grammars, where it is applied directly to the analysis of sentence structure. It is also the understanding of predicates as defined in English-language dictionaries. The predicate is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other being the subject, which the predicate modifies). The predicate must contain a verb, and the verb requires or permits other elements to complete the predicate, or it precludes them from doing so. These elements are objects (direct, indirect, prepositional), predicatives, and adjuncts: ::She dances. ‚Äì verb-only predicate ::Ben reads the book. ‚Äì verb-plus-direct-object predicate ::Ben's mother, Felicity, gave me a present. ‚Äì verb-plus-indirect-object-plus-direct- object predicate ::She listened to the radio. ‚Äì verb-plus-prepositional-object predicate ::They elected her president. ‚Äì verb-plus-object-plus-predicative- noun predicate ::She met him in the park. ‚Äì verb-plus-object-plus-adjunct predicate ::She is in the park. ‚Äì verb-plus-predicative-prepositional-phrase predicate The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like. The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a nexus. A predicative nominal is a noun phrase, such as in a sentence \\"George III is the king of England\\", the phrase \\"the king of England\\" being the predicative nominal. The subject and predicative nominal must be connected by a linking verb, also called a copula. A predicative adjective is an adjective, such as in Ivano is attractive, attractive being the predicative adjective. The subject and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula. This traditional understanding of predicates has a concrete reflex in many phrase structure theories of syntax. These theories divide an English declarative sentence (S) into a noun phrase (NP) and verb phrase (VP), e.g.Constituency trees like the one here, which divides the sentence into a subject NP and a predicate VP, can be found in most textbooks on syntax and grammar, e.g. , although the trees of these textbooks will vary in important details. ::Predicate tree 1 The subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue. This concept of sentence structure stands in stark contrast to dependency structure theories of grammar, which place the finite verb (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure and thus reject this binary NP-VP division, even for English. Languages with more flexible word order (often called nonconfigurational languages) are often treated differently also in phrase structure approaches. In modern theories of syntax and grammar Most modern theories of syntax and grammar take their inspiration for the theory of predicates from predicate calculus as associated with Gottlob Frege. This understanding sees predicates as relations or functions over arguments. The predicate serves either to assign a property to a singular term argument or to relate two or more arguments to each other. Sentences consist of predicates and their arguments (and adjuncts) and are thus predicate-argument structures, whereby a given predicate is seen as linking its arguments into a greater structure.For examples of theories that pursue this understanding of predicates, see , , , , , , , , , . This understanding of predicates sometimes renders a predicate and its arguments in the following manner: ::Bob laughed. ‚Üí laughed (Bob), or laughed = ∆í(Bob) ::Sam helped you. ‚Üí helped (Sam, you) ::Jim gave Jill his dog. ‚Üí gave (Jim, Jill, his dog) Predicates are placed on the left outside of brackets, whereas the predicate's arguments are placed inside the brackets.For examples of this use of notation, see , , . One acknowledges the valency of predicates, whereby a given predicate can be avalent (not shown), monovalent (laughed in the first sentence), divalent (helped in the second sentence), or trivalent (gave in the third sentence). These types of representations are analogous to formal semantic analyses, where one is concerned with the proper account of scope facts of logical quantifiers and logical operators. Concerning basic sentence structure, however, these representations suggest above all that verbs are predicates, and the noun phrases that they appear with their arguments. On this understanding of the sentence, the binary division of the clause into a subject NP and a predicate VP is hardly possible. Instead, the verb is the predicate, and the noun phrases are its arguments. Other function words ‚Äì e.g. auxiliary verbs, certain prepositions, phrasal particles, etc. ‚Äì are viewed as part of the predicate.See for example , , , , . While the analyses of these linguists vary, they agree insofar as various types of function words are grouped together as part of the predicate, which means complex predicates are very possible. The matrix predicates are in bold in the following examples: ::Bill will have laughed. ::Will Bill have laughed? ::That is funny. ::Has that been funny? ::They had been satisfied. ::Had they been satisfied, ... ::The butter is in the drawer. ::Fred took a picture of Sue. ::Susan is pulling your leg. ::Whom did Jim give his dog to? :: You should give it up. Note that not just verbs can be part of the matrix predicate, but also adjectives, nouns, prepositions, etc.For examples of theories that extend the predicate to other word classes (beyond verbs), see , , , . The understanding of predicates suggested by these examples sees the main predicate of a clause consisting of at least one verb and a variety of other possible words. The words of the predicate need not form a string nor a constituent,That many predicates are not constituents is acknowledged by many, e.g. , . but they can be interrupted by their arguments (or adjuncts). The approach to predicates illustrated with these sentences is widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany. This modern understanding of predicates is compatible with the dependency grammar approach to sentence structure, which places the finite verb as the root of all structure, e.g.Dependency trees like the one here can be found in, for instance, . ::Predicate tree 2' The matrix predicate is (again) marked in blue and its two arguments are in green. While the predicate cannot be construed as a constituent in the formal sense, it is a catena. Barring a discontinuity, predicates and their arguments are always catenae in dependency structures. Predicators Some theories of grammar seek to avoid the confusion generated by the competition between the two predicate notions by acknowledging predicators.For examples of grammars that employ the term predicator, see for instance , , , and The term predicate is employed in the traditional sense of the binary division of the clause, whereas the term predicator is used to denote the more modern understanding of matrix predicates. On this approach, the periphrastic verb catenae briefly illustrated in the previous section are predicators. Further illustrations are provided next: ::Predicate trees 3' The predicators are in blue. These verb catenae generally contain a main verb and potentially one or more auxiliary verbs. The auxiliary verbs help express functional meaning of aspect and voice. Since the auxiliary verbs contribute functional information only, they do not qualify as separate predicators, but rather each time they form the matrix predicator with the main verb. Carlson classes The seminal work of Greg Carlson distinguishes between types of predicates., . Based on Carlson's work, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject. =Stage-level predicates= A stage-level predicate is true of a temporal stage of its subject. For example, if John is \\"hungry\\", then he typically will eat some food. His state of being hungry therefore lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan. Stage-level predicates can occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and are probably the most versatile kind of predicate. =Individual-level predicates= An individual-level predicate is true throughout the existence of an individual. For example, if John is \\"smart\\", this is a property that he has, regardless of which particular point in time we consider. Individual-level predicates are more restricted than stage-level ones. Individual-level predicates cannot occur in presentational \\"there\\" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed): :: There are police available.  available is stage-level predicate :: *There are firemen altruistic.  altruistic is an individual- level predicate Stage-level predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers. Individual-level predicates do not, e.g. :: Tyrone spoke French loudly in the corridor.  speak French can be interpreted as a stage-level predicate :: *Tyrone knew French silently in the corridor.  know French cannot be interpreted as a stage-level predicate When an individual-level predicate occurs in past tense, it gives rise to what is called a lifetime effect: The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise out of existence. ::John was available.  Stage-level predicate does NOT evoke the lifetime effect. ::John was altruistic.  Individual-level predicate does evoke the lifetime effect. =Kind-level predicates= A kind- level predicate is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind. An example of this is the predicate are widespread. One cannot meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread. One may only say this of kinds, as in :: Cats are widespread. Certain types of noun phrases cannot be the subject of a kind- level predicate. We have just seen that a proper name cannot be. Singular indefinite noun phrases are also banned from this environment: :: *A cat is widespread.  Compare: Nightmares are widespread. =Collective vs. distributive predicates= Predicates may also be collective or distributive. Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones do not. An example of a collective predicate is \\"formed a line\\". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject: :: The students formed a line. ‚Äì Collective predicate appears with plural subject. :: *The student formed a line. ‚Äì Collective predicate cannot appear with singular subject. Other examples of collective predicates include meet in the woods, surround the house, gather in the hallway and carry the piano together. Note that the last one (carry the piano together) can be made non-collective by removing the word together. Quantifiers differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with all the can, while ones formed with every or each cannot. :: All the students formed a line. ‚Äì Collective predicate possible with all the. :: All the students gathered in the hallway. ‚Äì Collective predicate possible with all the. :: All the students carried a piano together. ‚Äì Collective predicate possible with all the. :: *Every student formed a line. ‚Äì Collective predicate impossible with every. :: *Each student gathered in the hallway. ‚Äì Collective predicate impossible with each.

Career Born in Orrell, Lancashire, Gaskell began his football career with Manchester United F.C. having been spotted playing for youth team Orrell St Luke's. He made his senior debut for United on 24 October 1956, when he played in the 1956 FA Charity Shield at the age of 16 years and 19 days, making him the youngest player ever to have played for the club. His league debut came over a year later, in a 4‚Äì3 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 30 November 1957. He was not with the Manchester United squad when their aeroplane crashed at Munich on the way home from a European Cup tie on 6 February 1958, killing eight players. By the early 1960s, he had become a regular in the United first team, covering for first choice goalkeeper Harry Gregg. The zenith of Gaskell's career came in 1963, when he kept goal for United in their 1963 FA Cup Final win over Leicester City. A succession of injuries to Gregg meant that Gaskell was in and out of the first team on a regular basis, but the signing of Pat Dunne in May 1964 meant that Gaskell was relegated to the position of third- choice goalkeeper. Both Gregg and Dunne left in 1966, but the arrival of Alex Stepney and the emergence of young Jimmy Rimmer meant that Gaskell was still third-choice at the club, so he left in the summer of 1969.

There is ongoing research into brain modularity in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience, although the current idea is much weaker than what was proposed by Chomsky and Jerry Fodor in the 1980s. In today's terminology, 'modularity' refers to specialisation: language processing is specialised in the brain to the extent that it occurs in different areas than other types of information processing such as visual input. The current view is, then, that language is neither compartmentalised nor based on general principles of processing (as proposed by George Lakoff), but between the two extreme positions that were postulated by non-experts in neuroscience. However, it is modular to the extent that language constitutes a specific cognitive skill.  Meaning of a module  The notion of a dedicated language module in the human brain originated with Noam Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar (UG). The debate on the issue of modularity in language is underpinned, in part, by different understandings of this concept.Coltheart, M. (1999). Modularity and cognition. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 3, 115‚Äì120 There is, however, some consensus in the literature that a module is considered committed to processing specialized representations (domain-specificity) (Bryson and Stein, 2001)Bryson, J. J. (2002). Language isn‚Äôt quite that special. Brain and Behavioral Sciences, 25 (6), 679‚Äì680Fodor, J. A. (1983). The Modularity of Mind. Bradford Books. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA in an informationally encapsulated way.Flombaum, J. I., Santos, L. R., & Hauser, M. D. (2002). Neuroecology and psychological modularity. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 6 (3), 106‚Äì108 A distinction should be drawn between anatomical modularity, which proposes there is one 'area' in the brain that deals with this processing, and functional modularity that obviates anatomical modularity whilst maintaining information encapsulation in distributed parts of the brain.Calabretta, R., Di Ferdinando, A., Wagner, G. P., & Parisi, D. (2003). What does it take to evolve behaviorally complex organisms? BioSystems, 69, 245‚Äì262  No singular anatomical module  The available evidence points towards no one anatomical area solely devoted to processing language. The Wada test, where sodium amobarbital is used to anaesthetise one hemisphere, shows that the left-hemisphere appears to be crucial in language processing.Wada, J., & Rasmussen, T. (1960). Intracarotid injection of Sodium Amytal for the lateralization of cerebral speech dominance. Experimental and clinical observations. Journal of Neurosurgery, 17, 266‚Äì282 Yet, neuroimaging does not implicate any single area but rather identifies many different areas as being involved in different aspects of language processing.Raichle, M.E. (1988). Positron emission tomographic studies of the cortical anatomy of single-word processing. Nature, 331, 585‚Äì589.Martin, R. C. (2003).

Kingstone (Eds.), Handbook of Functional Neuroimaging of Cognition (pp. 187‚Äì251). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press and not just in the left hemisphere.Robertson, D.

Psychological Science, 11, 255‚Äì60 Further, individual areas appear to subserve a number of different functions.Grodinsky, Y. (2006). The language faculty, Broca‚Äôs region, and the mirror system. Cortex, 42 (4), 464‚Äì468 Thus, the extent to which language processing occurs within an anatomical module is considered to be minimal. Nevertheless, as many have suggested,Pinker, S. (1997). How The Mind Works. Harmondsworth: Penguinvon der Malsburg, C. (1995). Binding in models of perception and brain function. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 5, 520‚Äì52 modular processing can still exist even when implemented across the brain; that is, language processing could occur within a functional module.  No double dissociation ‚Äì acquired or developmental  A common way to demonstrate modularity is to find a double dissociation. That is two groups: First, people for whom language is severely damaged and yet have normal cognitive abilities and, second, persons for whom normal cognitive abilities are grossly impaired and yet language remains intact.Dunn, J. C., & Kirsner, K. (2003). What can we infer from double dissociations? Cortex, 39, 1‚Äì7Coltheart, M., & Davies, M. (2003). Inference and explanation in cognitive neuropsychology. Cortex, 39, 188‚Äì191Moscovitch, M. & Umilt√†, C. (1990). Modularity and neuropsychology: implications for the organization of attention and memory in normal and brain-damaged people. In M. F. Schwartz (Ed.), Modular Deficits in Alzheimertype dementia. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press Whilst extensive lesions in the left hemisphere perisylvian area can render persons unable to produce or perceive language (global aphasia),Goodglass, H., & Kaplan, E. (1972). The Assessment of Aphasia and Related Disorders. Philadelphia, PA: Lea & Febiger there is no known acquired case where language is completely intact in the face of severe non-linguistic deterioration.Levy, Y. (1996). Modularity of language reconsidered. Brain & Language, 55 (2), 240‚Äì263 Thus, functional module status cannot be granted to language processing based on this evidence. However, other evidence from developmental studies has been presented (most famously by PinkerPinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: How the mind creates language, pp. 37‚Äì43. New York: W. Morrow) as supporting a language module, namely the purported dissociation between Specific Language Impairment (SLI), where language is disrupted whilst other mental abilities are not,van der Lely, H. K. J. (2005). Domain-Specific Cognitive Systems: Insight from Grammatical Specific Language Impairment, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9 (2), 53‚Äì59 and Williams Syndrome (WS) where language is said to be spared despite severe mental deficits.Bellugi, U., Marks, S., Bihrle, A., & Sabo, H. (1988). Dissociation between language and cognitive functions in Williams syndrome. In D. Bishop and K. Mogford (Eds.), Language development in exceptional circumstances (pp. 177‚Äì189). London: Churchill Livingstone More recent and empirically robust work has shown that these claims may be inaccurate, thus, considerably weakening support for dissociation. For example, work reviewed by BrockBrock, J. (2007). Language abilities in Williams syndrome: A critical review. Development and Psychopathology, 19, 97‚Äì127 and Mervis and BecceraMervis, C. B., & Beccera, A. M. (2007). Language and communicative development in Williams Syndrome. Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews, 13, 3‚Äì15 demonstrated that language abilities in WS are no more than would be predicted by non-linguistic abilities. Further, there is considerable debate concerning whether SLI is actually a language disorder or whether its aetiology is due to a more general cognitive (e.g. phonological) problem.Norbury, C., Bishop, D. V. M., & Briscoe, J. (2001). Production of English finite verb morphology: A Comparison of SLI and mildmoderate hearing impairment. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 44, 165‚Äì178Leonard, L. 1998, Children with Specific Language Impairment. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT PressBishop, D. V. M. (1994). Grammatical errors in specific language impairment: Competence or performance limitations. Applied Psycholinguistics, 15, 507‚Äì550Kail, R. (1994). A method for studying the generalized slowing hypothesis in children with specific language impairment. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 37, 418‚Äì421 Thus, the evidence needed to complete the picture for modularity intact language coupled with gross intellectual deterioration is not forthcoming. Consequently, developmental data offers little support for the notion that language processing occurs within a module. Thus, the evidence from double dissociations does not support modularity, although lack of dissociation is not evidence against a module; this inference cannot be logically made.  Lack of information encapsulation  Indeed, if language were a module it would be informationally encapsulated. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case. For instance, in the McGurk effect, watching lips say one phoneme whilst another is played creates the percept of a blended phoneme.McGurk, H., & MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices. Nature, 264 (5588), 746‚Äì748Carston, R. (1996). The architecture of the mind: modularity and modularization. In D. Green et al. (Eds.), Cognitive Science: An Introduction (pp. 53‚Äì83). Cambridge: Blackwell Further, Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard and Sedivy (1995) demonstrated visual information mediating syntactic processing. In addition, the putative language module should process only that information relevant to language (i.e., be domain- specific). Yet evidence suggests that areas purported to subserve language also mediate motor controlHeiser, M., Iacoboni, M., Maeda, F., Marcus, J., & Mazziotta, J.C. (2003).

Brain, 126 (4), 928‚Äì945 Although it is possible that separate processes could be occurring but below the resolution of current imaging techniques, when all this evidence is taken together the case for information encapsulation is weakened.  Alternative views  The alternative, as it is framed, is that language occurs within a more general cognitive system.Rumelhart, D. E., & McClelland, J. L.

Cognition, 95, 201‚Äì236 about human language. This is usually supported by evidence such as all attempts to teach animals human languages to any great success have failed (Hauser et al. 2003) and that language can be selectively damaged (a single dissociation)Pulvermuller, F. (2003). The Neuroscience of Language. On Brain Circuits of Words and Serial Order. UK, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press suggesting proprietary computation may be required. Instead of postulating 'pure' modularity, theorists have opted for a weaker version, domain- specificity implemented in functionally specialised neural circuits and computation (e.g. Jackendoff and Pinker‚Äôs words, we must investigate language ‚Äúnot as a monolith but as a combination of components, some special to language, others rooted in more general capacities‚Äù).Jackendoff, R. & Pinker, S.

The first artist signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, she released two albums on Asylum and partially completed a third album before dying of a drug overdose in 1979. Her eponymous debut album was released in late 1971 and was followed about 18 months later by Heart Food. In 1974, she recorded demos for a third album, which never was completed. The demos were released posthumously with other rarities on the 2005 two-disc collection Dreams Come True. Sill was influenced by Bach, especially his suites, while lyrically her work drew substantially on Christian themes of rapture and redemption. Biography =Early life and troubles= Judith Lynne Sill was born in Studio City, California on October 7, 1944, and spent her early childhood in the Oakland, California area. Her father, Milford \\"Bun\\" Sill, an importer of exotic animals for use in films, owned a bar in Oakland, in which Sill learned to play the piano. When he died of pneumonia in 1952, Sill's mother Oneta moved with Judee and her older brother Dennis to Los Angeles, where Oneta soon met and married Tom and Jerry animator Kenneth Muse. In a 1972 Rolling Stone magazine interview, Sill described her home life after her mother's remarriage as unhappy and frequently violent due to physical fights between Sill and her parents. She transferred from a public high school (Birmingham High School in Van Nuys) to a private school, where she met other rebellious teenagers, some of whom were allegedly involved in crime. Either during high school or after her graduation (depending on the source), Sill and a man she had met committed a series of armed robberies of businesses such as liquor stores and gas stations. Sill and her robbery partner were soon arrested and she spent nine months in reform school, where she served as church organist and \\"learned a lot of good music\\" including gospel music. After being released, Sill briefly attended San Fernando Valley Junior College as an art major. She also played piano in the school orchestra and worked in a piano bar. In 1964, her mother died, and she left college and moved out of her stepfather's home. She started doing LSD and other drugs, moved in with an LSD dealer and joined a jazz trio. In April 1966, Sill married pianist Robert Maurice \\"Bob\\" Harris. The couple lived in Las Vegas for a time, but both developed crippling heroin addictions within months. When Sill moved back to California, she resorted to sex work, scams, and check forgery to support her habit. A string of narcotics and forgery offenses sent her to jail, and she learned that her brother Dennis had suddenly died of a liver infection. When she got out, she immediately set to work as a song composer. =Music career= Sill encountered Graham Nash and David Crosby and toured with them for a time as their opening act. After some initial interest from Atlantic Records, David Geffen offered her a contract with his new Asylum label. She sold her song \\"Lady-O\\" to the Turtles, and was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone. Harris worked on her first album and was involved with the Turtles (which led to his short stint as keyboardist with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention in 1971). Graham Nash produced her first album's first single, \\"Jesus was a Cross Maker\\", released to radio on October 1, 1971. The album Judee Sill was released on September 15, 1971. It featured Sill's voice in multiple overdubs, often in a four-part chorale or fugue. She worked with engineer Henry Lewy, noted for his work with Joni Mitchell throughout the 1970s. The album was not a commercial success. Sill took over the orchestration and arrangements on her second album Heart Food, which included \\"The Donor\\". Heart Food was released in March 1973 and was critically acclaimed, but sold poorly, leading to the end of her association with Geffen and Asylum Records. Sill's friends have said that she lacked the resilience to cope with poor album sales and bad reviews of her work, and that she was dropped after she refused to perform as an opening act, a task she disliked. According to another source, Geffen pulled support for Heart Food and refused to release any more of her records after Sill, frustrated over what she perceived as his lack of support for her career, publicly referred to him by using a homophobic slur (she either called Geffen \\"fat fag‚Äù on stage or referred to his ‚Äúfaggoty pink shoes‚Äù). She continued to write songs, and in 1974, began to record new material for a planned third album at the studio of Michael Nesmith.\\"Overlooked No More: Judee Sill, Singer Whose Life Was Cut Short,\\" The New York Times, January 23, 2020. By this time, Sill was once again suffering from drug abuse and other health problems, and her music was not regarded as marketable. She also was beginning to lose interest in music and focus on other pursuits, including theosophy and animals. In the mid-1970s, she worked for a time as a cartoonist with a Los Angeles animation studio. Her 1974 recordings were never finished. Twenty-six years after Sill's 1979 death, the unfinished songs were mixed by Jim O'Rourke and released, along with a collection of rarities and home demos, as the album Dreams Come True on the Water label. =Personal life and death= Sill's personal life was turbulent, and she was affected by the early deaths of her father, mother and brother. Sill claimed to have been married twice, saying in interviews that she was briefly married either during or just after high school to a classmate, that her parents had the marriage annulled, and that he later died in a rafting accident. A friend of Sill's has written that she claimed to have married her robbery partner as a teenager. Sill's second marriage was to Robert Maurice \\"Bob\\" Harris on April 27, 1966 in Clark County, Nevada. They divorced in 1972. She married Samir Ben Taieb Kamoun, a Tunisian actor, mime, and Charlie Chaplin impersonator, on January 24, 1979 in Clark County, Nevada. Sill was openly bisexual and had relationships with both men and women. Her romance with singer-songwriter J.D. Souther inspired her song \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\". Souther later wrote the song \\"Something in the Dark\\" about her. She had a long-term relationship with poet David Omer Bearden, who contributed lyrics to Heart Food and toured and performed with her; Sill dedicated Heart Food to him. As Asylum's first published artist, Sill also had a close friendship with David Geffen, which went awry after comments she made in frustration at not receiving enough promotion for her second UK tour. After a series of car accidents and failed surgery for a painful back injury, Sill struggled with drug addiction and dropped out of the music scene. She died of a drug overdose, or \\"acute cocaine and codeine intoxication,\\" on November 23, 1979 at her apartment on Morrison Street in North Hollywood. The Los Angeles coroner ruled her death a suicide, taking into account a note found near her body, but some who knew her have contended that the note, which reportedly contained \\"a meditation on rapture, the hereafter, and the innate mystery of life\\", was not a suicide note but rather a diary entry or song concept. Her ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean after a ceremony organized by a few close friends at the Self-Realization Fellowship in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. According to a 2006 Washington Post story, by the time of Sill's death, she had become so obscure that no obituary was published, and for many years, a number of her friends were unaware she had died. Influence and legacy Although Sill's music was not commercially successful, a number of later songwriters have been fans of her work, including Andy Partridge, Liz Phair, Warren Zevon, Shawn Colvin, Steven Wilson and Terra Spencer. She was included in The Billboard Guide to Contemporary Christian Music; her faith was debatable, but she made frequent use of Christian symbolism in her lyrics, combined with a \\"lack of sensuality\\" and the \\"denial of the physical\\". Her music has been described as \\"intensely devotional\\". A BBC Radio 4 programme titled The Lost Genius of Judee Sill was broadcast on September 9, 2014.\\"The Lost Genius of Judee Sill\\", BBC Radio 4. The Okkervil River song \\"Okkervil River R.I.P.\\" speaks of Sill as having died \\"in some trailer park of cocaine and codeine, all alone.\\" Singer-songwriter Laura Veirs's \\"Song for Judee\\" on the 2016 album case/lang/veirs is about Sill's life and death. In an interview with CBC music, Veirs said of the track \\"We weren‚Äôt sure we were going to track this one because not everyone in the band loved it. We recorded it on a whim and all fell in love with it. It‚Äôs about a tragic songwriter from the ‚Äô70s named Judee Sill. I love how the bouncy chorus offsets the darkness of her story.\\" =Posthumous reissues and releases= Terry Hounsome's 1981 book New Rock Record lists a Sill album titled Tulips From Amsterdam. Unsure of the information's source, Hounsome later removed the listing from his database. Sill appears on Tommy Peltier's Chariot of Astral Light (featuring Judee Sill), which was recorded in the 1970s but not released until 2005 on the Black Beauty label. She contributed guitar, organ and backing vocals to six tracks on the album and is pictured with Peltier on the cover. Also in 2005, Sill's unfinished recordings, mixed by Jim O'Rourke, were released along with other rarities and unreleased demos as Dreams Come True, a two-CD set on Water Records. Sill's two original albums, Judee Sill and Heart Food, were released that year as individual CDs, each with bonus tracks, on the Rhino Handmade label. The next year, Rhino released Abracadabra: The Asylum Years, a two-CD set of both albums with bonus tracks. In 2007, an album of Sill's live performance tracks performed for the BBC was released as Live in London: The BBC Recordings 1972-1973. In 2017 independent record label Intervention Records released 180-gram double 45rpm LP reissues of Sill‚Äôs self-titled album and Heart Food. =Covers= \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\" has been covered by the Hollies on their 1972 album Romany; by Cass Elliot on her self-titled 1972 album; by Judie Tzuke on her 1991 album Left Hand Talking; by Warren Zevon on his 1995 album Mutineer; and by Rachael Yamagata in 2005 for the soundtrack of the Cameron Crowe film Elizabethtown, in which The Hollies‚Äô version is played over the opening credits. The soundtrack album for the film contains versions by both Yamagata and the Hollies. Shawn Colvin performed \\"There's a Rugged Road\\" on her 1994 collection of covers titled Cover Girl. Jane Siberry contributed vocals to a cover of \\"The Kiss\\" for Ghostland's album Interview with the Angel. This version was also released on Siberry's 2001 compilation City.\\"The Kiss\\" was also covered by Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy on his 2004 CD single No More Workhorse Blues; by Neil Cavanagh on his 2008 album Short Flight to a Distant Star; and by Matt Alber, using Sill's original piano arrangement, on his 2011 album Constant Crows. In 2009, the independent label American Dust announced the release of Crayon Angel: A Tribute to the Music of Judee Sill, featuring covers of Sill's songs done by Beth Orton, Bill Callahan, Ron Sexsmith, Daniel Rossen, Final Fantasy, Marissa Nadler, Frida Hyv√∂nen and Meg Baird, among others.

Their sound is diverse with quiet instrumental jazz influenced sections and aggressive black metal blast beats and vocals. Ved Buens Ende means \\"By the end of the bow\\" referring to the mythological rainbow Bifr√∂st.  History  Ved Buens Ende was formed in Oslo in 1993 by the drummer Carl-Michael Eide and guitarist Vicotnik, who were then joined by bassist Skoll. Prior to this, Carl-Michael Eide had been playing in Ulver and Vicotnik in his own project Manes which eventually became Ved Buens Ende, not to be confused with other Norwegian band Manes, known as Perifa, and later, Manii. They were signed to the British label Misanthropy Records. The band was unique by their mixture of many unusual musical elements for Metal, such as atonality and dissonance, a very prominent bass sound as well as Eide's crooning and Vicotnik's characteristic shrieks. The band split up in 1997, after releasing only one album, Written in Waters. On 26 April 2006, Blabbermouth.net announced that Ved Buens Ende had reformed, and were working on new material. Along with Vicotnik and Carl-Michael Eide, who now plays guitar instead of drums, there are two new members; Petter \\"Plenum\\" Berntsen on bass and Einar \\"Esso\\" Sjurs√∏ on drums. They are also members of Carl-Michael Eide's band Virus. Many fans of the band were surprised by the absence of Hugh Mingay (aka Skoll), whose place was taken by Petter Berntsen. The band's drummer, Einar Sjurs√∏, had this to say about the band on Blabbermouth.net: \\"We will record a new album this year, to be released in 2007 by an as-yet-undetermined label (interested parties get in touch) and we also aim at playing live, where we will perform material both from 'Written In Waters' and the [post-VED BUENS ENDE project] VIRUS 'Carheart' album plus of course new compositions. The new material is being developed at the moment and will differ from both 'Written In Waters' and 'Carheart' yet still retain the trademark off the wall guitar sounds of those releases.\\" The band broke up again in early 2007, without having released another album. Several songs intended for this album ultimately appeared on Virus' The Black Flux. As of 2019, they have reunited again. The current lineup is Skoll on bass, Carl- Michael Eide on guitars/clean vocals, Vicotnik on guitars/harsh vocals, and √òyvind Myrvoll on drums.

He was one of the leading advocates of liberalism in the Prussian Landtag and the German Reichstag.Cf. Abb√© E. Wetterl√© (Representative for Alsace-Lorraine): few men exercised over Parliament an action so powerful as his. When the President granted him leave to speak, all the members gathered around him, for he never left his seat to mount the tribune. ... Bismarck, who could not stand contradiction, used to leave the assembly as soon as Richter began to speak. ... Few debaters had the courage to try their strength with the terrible polemicist. Kardorff and Kanitz, like Bebel and Singer, only reluctantly accepted the struggle with the man who always succeeded in having the laugh on his side. In: Behind the Scenes in the Reichstag, New York, 1918, p.47-48. (online) Career Son of a combat medic, Richter attended the Gymnasium in his home town of D√ºsseldorf. In 1856 he began to study Law and Economics, first at the University of Bonn, and later at the Berlin and Heidelberg. He obtained a law degree in 1859. Richter became a strong advocate of free trade, a market economy, and a Rechtsstaat; views he held for all his life. In 1859 he became a civil servant in the judiciary. He achieved some renown for his essay √úber die Freiheit des Schankgewerbes (On the liberty of the tavern trade). His liberal views caused some trouble with the Prussian bureaucracy. In 1864 he was elected the mayor of Neuwied, but the president of the provincial government refused to confirm his election result. Richter left the civil service, and became the parliamentary correspondent of the Elberfelder Zeitung in Berlin. In 1867 he entered the Reichstag, and after 1869 also became a member of the Prussian Lower House. He became the leader of the German Progress Party (Deutsche Fortschrittspartei), after 1884 the German Freeminded Party (Deutsche Freisinnige Partei), after 1893 the Freeminded People's Party (Freisinnige Volkspartei), and was one of the leading critics of the policies of Otto von Bismarck. Richter opposed the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878 that banned the Social Democratic Party. He said: \\"I fear Social-Democracy more under this law than without it\\".W. H. Dawson, Bismarck and State Socialism. An Exposition of the Social and Economic Legislation of Germany since 1870 (London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1891), p. 44. In response to rumours that Bismarck was planning to introduce a tobacco monopoly, Richter unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Reichstag to pass a resolution that condemned such a monopoly as \\"economically, financially, and politically unjustifiable\\".Dawson, pp. 64-65. When Bismarck proposed a system of social insurance that was to be paid for by the state, Richter denounced it as \\"not Socialistic, but Communistic\\".A. J. P. Taylor, Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1955), p. 202. From 1885 to 1904 he was the chief editor of the liberal newspaper Freisinnige Zeitung. Political positions =Opposition to socialism= His novel \\"Pictures of the Socialistic Future\\" (1891) is a dystopian novel which predicts what would happen to Germany if the socialism espoused by the trade unionists, social democrats, and Marxists was put into practice. It is a 19th- century version of George Orwell's 1984. He aims to show that government ownership of the means of production and central planning of the economy would lead to shortages, not abundance as the socialists claimed. He seeks to draw attention to the problem of incentives in the absence of profits, and the public choice vested interests of bureaucrats and politicians. He also focuses on the connection between economic and political liberty. Written in the form of a diary by a supporter of the socialist revolution who comes to see the horrors he has wrought, the narrator begins by applauding expropriation, the use of force to prevent emigration, and the reassignment of people to new tasks, all the while assuring doubters that paradise is just around the corner. At one point he asks rhetorically: \\"What is freedom of the press if the government owns all the presses? What is freedom of religion if the government owns all the houses of worship?\\" highlighting the abuse of power possible when these are owned by the state. Society however begins to deteriorate as shortages begin to occur, the wealth generated by capitalism declines, while the military and the police forces grow. His work has been described as \\"prophetic\\" of what socialism (in Germany and elsewhere) would mean practically, with the protagonist (a committed socialist) still justifying every abuse to himself throughout the novel even as every goal of the socialists' fails.Pictures of the Socialistic Future-Foundation for Economic Education =Opposition to anti-semitism= Anti-semitism was prevalent in the 1870s in Germany, but when the historian Heinrich von Treitschke and the Court Preacher Adolph St√∂cker endorsed it in 1879, what had been a fringe phenomenon gained national attention. Various newspapers (such as the \\"Berliner Antisemitismusstreit\\") published articles attacking Jews. A petition to the Reich Chancellor Otto von Bismarck called for administrative measures banning Jewish immigration, and restricting their access to positions in education and the judiciary (\\"Antisemitenpetition\\", German Wikipedia). Although anti-semitism was opposed by Eugen Richter's Progress Party and some National Liberals led by Theodor Mommsen and Heinrich Rickert (father of the philosopher Heinrich Rickert), other National Liberals, and the other parties ‚Äî Conservatives, Center Party, and Socialists ‚Äî mostly either stayed aloof or flirted with anti-semitism. In November 1880, a declaration by 75 leading scientists, businessmen, and politicians was published in major newspapers condemning anti-semitism (\\"Notabeln-Erkl√§rung\\"). It was signed by among others the Mayor of Berlin Max von Forckenbeck, the anthropologist Rudolf Virchow, the historian Theodor Mommsen, and the entrepreneur and inventor Werner Siemens (founder of Siemens AG).Declaration of 75 Notables against Antisemitism (November 12, 1880) On 20 November 1880 the Progress Party brought the issue before the Prussian Landtag, asking the government to take a stand on whether or not legal restrictions were to be introduced (\\"Interpellation H√§nel\\"). The government confirmed that the legal status of Jews was not to be altered, but fell short of condemning anti-semitism. Rudolf Virchow complained in the ensuing debate:Die Judenfrage vor dem Preu√üischen Landtage. 1880, S. 63, (online, in German), (online, in German) How Berolina sifted the six. In the Reichstag elections of 1881, the candidates of the Progress Party (among them Eugen Richter and Rudolf Virchow) won all six seats in Berlin, here personified as Berolina. The candidates of the anti-semitic movement were not elected. From the satirical weekly Berliner Wespen (Berlin Wasps), 2 November 1881 While on the first day of the debate a consensus seemed to emerge against the anti-semitic movement, on the second day, November 22, 1880 some politicians began to declare their anti-semitism. In his speech, Eugen Richter predicted the eventual consequences of the anti- semitic movement: He concluded his speech with the words: Responding to an anti-semitic meeting on 17 December 1880, the Progress Party invited all electors for the Prussian Landtag to a meeting in the Reichshallen on 12 January 1881 to demonstrate that the citizens of Berlin did not support anti- semitism. Eugen Richter delivered a speech before an audience of 2.500 electors, attacking anti-semitic university students:Condemnation of the anti- Semitic Movement by the Electors of BerlinDie Verurtheilung der antisemitischen Bewegung durch die Wahlm√§nner von Berlin: Bericht √ºber die allgemeine Versammlung d. Wahlm√§nner aus d. 4. Berliner Landtags-Wahlkreisen am 12. Jan. 1881. C. Bartel, Berlin 1881 (in German) He turned the anti- semitic accusations around: Already in February 1880, the German Crown Prince and latter Emperor Frederick III had called the anti-semitic movement in a private conversation with the president of the Jewish corporation of Berlin, Meyer Magnus, \\"a disgrace for Germany\\" (in some reports also \\"a disgrace of our time\\" or \\"a disgrace for our nation\\"). Eugen Richter referred to these words, which the Crown Prince confirmed two days later: He rejected the claim that the anti-semitic movement had grown from the ranks of craftsmen, workers, and businessmen: In his concluding words, he called upon his audience: On 27 October 1881 the Progress Party defeated the anti-semitic \\"Berliner Bewegung\\" (Berlin Movement), winning all six seats for the capital, with Eugen Richter gaining 66% of the vote in the first round.

Presently the only official Triple Tiara is the three race series in New York; they are: The Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park at a distance of 1 mile, The Coaching Club American Oaks, run at Saratoga Race Course at a distance of 1‚Öõ miles and The Alabama Stakes, also run at Saratoga at a distance of 1¬º miles. History There have been attempts to develop a \\"Filly Triple Crown\\" or a Triple Tiara for fillies only, but no set series of three races consistently remained in the public eye. At least four different configurations of races have been designated as such. Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a \\"triple crown.\\" The New York Racing Association designated three of its races as a filly triple crown of sorts, but the races so designated changed over the years. Eight fillies won variations of the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993.  The New York Filly Triple Tiara (1957-2002 and 2007-2009)  The original Triple Tiara consisted of three races at Belmont Park: the 1 mile Acorn Stakes, the 1‚Öõ mile Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks, which varied in distance between 1¬º and 1¬Ω miles. Eight horses have won the series under this system: * Dark Mirage (1968) {also won the Kentucky Oaks} * Shuvee *A* (1969) * Chris Evert (1974) * Ruffian (1975) * Davona Dale (1979) {also won the Kentucky Oaks & the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes} * Mom's Command *A*(1985) * Open Mind *A* (1989) {also won the Kentucky Oaks} * Sky Beauty *A* (1993) *A* = Denotes that the horse also won the Alabama Stakes in the same year, which has been part of the Triple Tiara series since 2010, and was also part of that series from 2003 through 2006.  The New York Filly Triple Tiara (2003‚Äì2006)  In 2003, the Triple Tiara was reconfigured for a time to consist of the Mother Goose Stakes, Coaching Club American Oaks, and the Alabama Stakes, a 1¬º mile race held in August at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. The New York Racing Association, the operator of Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course, once offered a $2 million bonus to any filly that swept the three races. The bonus was discontinued in 2005. In 2007 the New York Racing Association reverted to the original three races of the tiara; the Acorn, Mother Goose and Coaching Club American Oaks. No filly swept this reconfigured series.  The New York Filly Triple Tiara (2010‚Äìpresent)  The Triple Tiara is now a set of three horse races in New York which is open to three-year-old fillies. The three races that compose the series now are The Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park at a distance of 1 mile, The Coaching Club American Oaks, run at Saratoga Race Course at a distance of 1‚Öõ miles and The Alabama Stakes, also run at Saratoga at a distance of 1¬º miles. The current race system was implemented in 2010 by the New York Racing Association and the series is sponsored by Betfair and TVG. No filly has swept this reconfigured series.  National Triple Tiara Proposals  In recent years, many owners and trainers of fillies have submitted proposals to the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to change the three races that compose the Triple Tiara. Although a great deal of prestige is attached to winning one or more of the current Triple Tiara races, all three are held in New York; because of this, the series is skewed to fillies that race in the northeast. Some from outside the area even modify the name of the series by calling it the \\"New York Triple Tiara.\\" Several options of races have been suggested to compose the \\"National Triple Tiara.\\" The most popular proposal of a \\"National Triple Tiara\\" are three races that are on the undercard of the three Triple Crown races for three-year-old males. The National Triple Tiara consists of the Kentucky Oaks, run at Churchill Downs in Louisville; the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, run at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore; and the Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. These three races are run on the same or similar date, and on the same racetrack, as the three races in the Triple Crown for colts. Another proposal has been to use the Kentucky Oaks, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and the Mother Goose Stakes. This version would allow more time for fillies to recuperate between races. Using the Mother Goose would also allow the New York Racing Association to keep the New York Triple Tiara (the Acorn Stakes, the Coaching Club American Oaks, and the Alabama Stakes) in place without interfering with the three National races. * In 1979 Davona Dale was the only filly to have won any combination of races seriously proposed for the National Triple Tiara. She won the three National Triple Tiara races, the Kentucky Oaks and Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and Acorn Stakes. She also won the Mother Goose Stakes, so two races in the New York Triple Tiara as well. A prime reason for favouring the National Triple Tiara is that the Kentucky Oaks is the most popular races for fillies and draws one of the biggest crowds of any stakes races throughout the year (behind only the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes). The Kentucky Oaks consistently outdraws the Belmont Stakes, the Travers Stakes and the Breeders' Cup series. On the other hand, the Black- Eyed Susan is currently only a Grade II race as few modern trainers are willing to race their fillies with only two weeks rest after the Kentucky Oaks. But champion filly Silverbulletday did it in 1999, proving that it is still able to be done.

W. Scripps Company, a diversified media conglomerate, and United Press news service. It became United Press International (UPI) when International News Service (INS) merged with United Press in 1958. The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University is named for him. Early life E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages. E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as \\"Wyllis\\".Edward Willis Scripps at Brittannica.com E. W. was a prolific consumer of whisky and cigars, according to his confidential assistant Gilson Gardner, and was said to drink a gallon (3.79 l) each day while bearing a lit cigar at all waking hours. Newspaper career Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half- brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company. E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not \\"sell out,\\" but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers. In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, now United Press International (UPI), from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said \\"I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press\\", to provide competition to the Associated Press. Scripps believed in editorial independence, stating, Later life In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby, thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of West Chester, (Butler County), Ohio but eventually lived there year-round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate. In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, now named the Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps College is also named in his step sister, Ellen Browning Scripps', honor, because a large part of its endowment derives from the media fortune they had built About Scripps College. Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 ‚Äì 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century. See also Samuel H. Scripps ‚Äì E. W.

He was born in Nechanice, Bohemia, and died in Vienna. His music was well respected by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. He was an instrumental performer as well. While being a prolific Organist, he also played the Violin and Cello. Name Wanhal and at least one of his publishers used the spelling Wa·πÖhal, the dot being an archaic form of the modern h√°ƒçek. \\"Wanhal obviously preferred the German spelling himself, but it should instead be recognized as a logical and ... use of the old Bohemian dot- over-the-n (= modern day h√°ƒçek) as part of his germanized signature.\\" \\"and he strenuously maintained the use of the h√°ƒçek (Weichheitszeichen) in the form of a dot over the n in the first editions issued by his chief Viennese publisher, Ignaz Sauer.\\" Other attested variants include Wanhall, Vanhal and Van Hall. The modern Czech form Jan K≈ôtitel Va≈àhal was introduced in the 20th century.\\"He himself spelt his name Johann Baptist Wa·πÖhal; his Viennese contemporaries and most scholars until World War II used the spelling Wa·πÖhal, but later in the 20th century a modern Czech form, Jan K≈ôtitel Va≈àhal, was erroneously introduced.\\" Paul Robey Bryan, \\"Vanhal, Johann Baptist [Jan K≈ôtitel]\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001), 19:592.  Biography  = Birth and youth in Bohemia: 1739‚Äì1760/61 = Wanhal was born in Nechanice, Bohemia, into serfdom in a Czech peasant family. He received his first musical training from his family and local musicians, excelling at the violin and organ from an early age. From these humble beginnings he was able to earn a living as a village organist and choirmaster. He was also taught German from an early age, as this was required for someone wishing to make a career in music within the Habsburg empire. = First period in Vienna: 1760/61‚Äì1769 = By the age of 21 Wanhal must have been well under way to become a skilled performer and composer, as his patron, the Countess Schaffgotsch, took him to Vienna as part of her personal train in 1760. There he quickly established himself as a teacher of singing, violin and piano to the high nobility, and he was invited to conduct his symphonies for illustrious patrons such as the Erd≈ëdy families and Baron Isaac von Riesch of Dresden. During the years 1762‚Äì63, he is supposed to have been the student of Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, even though they were born the same year. Baron Riesch sponsored a trip to Italy in 1769, so that Wanhal could learn the Italian style of composition, which was very much in fashion. To return the favour, Wanhal was supposed to become Riesch's Kapellmeister. = Journey to Italy: 1769‚Äì1771 = The details of Wanhal's journey to Italy are scant, but it is known that he met his fellow Bohemians Gluck and Florian Gassmann in Venice and Rome respectively. The Italian journeys present the only knowledge we have of Wanhal writing operas: He is supposed either to have written operas over the Metastasian operas Il Trionfo di Clelia and Demofonte, either by himself, or as a cooperation with Gassmann, where Wanhal supplied some or all of the arias; these works have been lost. In additions to his documented travels in northern and central Italy, Wanhal was supposed to travel to Naples ‚Äì arguably the most important centre of music in Italy at the time ‚Äì but never seems to have gotten there. = Vienna and Vara≈ædin: 1771‚Äì1780 = After his journey to Italy, Wanhal returned to Vienna rather than to go to Riesch in Dresden. Claims have been made that Wanhal became heavily depressed or even insane, but these claims are likely to have been overstated. During this period he is supposed to have acted occasionally as a de facto Kapellmeister for Count Erd≈ëdy in Vara≈ædin, although the small number of compositions by him remaining there suggests that this was not the full-time role that would have been expected if he had worked with Riesch; Vanhal might have preferred such employment with the Count precisely because of its part-time nature. There is no evidence of visits after 1779. = Return to Vienna and final years: 1780‚Äì1813 = Around 1780, Wanhal stopped writing symphonies and string quartets, focusing instead on music for piano and small-scale chamber ensembles, masses and other church music. The former, written for a growing middle class, supplied him with the means to live a modest, economically independent life; for the last 30 years of his life he did not work under any patron, probably being the first Viennese composer to do so. During these years, more than 270 of his works were published by Viennese printers. In the 1780s he was still an active participant in Viennese musical life. In 1782 he met Mozart, who admired Wanhal's Symphonies. He enjoyed playing music with Mozart and some of his friends who were composers, as testified in Michael Kelly's account of the string quartet Wanhal played in together with Haydn, Mozart and Dittersdorf in 1784. After 1787 or so, however, he seems to have ceased performing in public, but he nevertheless was economically secure, living in good quarters near St. Stephen's Cathedral. He died in 1813, an elderly composer whose music was still recognized by the Viennese public.  Personal Life  = Pedagogy = He learned to play the Organ from his teacher Anton Erban, who was one of his most prized mentors. He spent the first two decades of his life training to play both string and wind instruments, and to sing as well. = Romantic Isolation = Johann Baptist Wanhal died having never having married and never had any children. His life was rather long and lacked stress.  Style  Wanhal had to be a prolific writer to meet the demands made upon him, and attributed to him are 100 quartets, at least 73 symphonies, 95 sacred works, and a large number of instrumental and vocal works. The symphonies, in particular, have been committed increasingly often to compact disc in recent times, and the best of them are comparable with many of Haydn's. Many of Wanhal's symphonies are in minor keys and are considered highly influential to the \\"Sturm und Drang\\" movement of his time. \\"[Wanhal] makes use of repeated semiquavers, pounding quavers in the bass line, wide skips in the themes, sudden pauses (fermatas), silences, exaggerated dynamic marks ... and all these features ... appear in Mozart's first large-scale Sturm und Drang symphony, no. 25 in g minor (K. 183) of 1773.\\"H. C. Robbins Landon, Mozart and Vienna: Including Selections from Johann Pezzl's 'Sketch of Vienna' (1786‚Äì90) (London: Thames and Hudson; New York: Schirmer Books, 1991, ), 48. This kind of style also appears in Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 83 in g minor, The Hen (1785), and Muzio Clementi's Sonata in g minor, Op.34, No.2 (circa 1795). Around 1780 Wanhal seems to have stopped writing large-scale instrumental music, and rather contented himself with writing piano music for the growing middle class, and church music. In the former category his programmatic pieces, often related to recent events such as \\"the Battle of W√ºrzburg\\", \\"the Battle of Abukir\\", and \\"the Return of Francis II in 1809\\". Judging from the number of extant manuscripts available, these works must have been highly popular. Wanhal was also the most prolific writer of Masses and other Catholic church music of his generation in Vienna. Despite this, it appears that he was never in the employ of any religious institution. This means that his late Masses are both testaments to a genuine personal faith, and evidence of how lucrative his focus on incidental piano music must have been. Robert O. Gjerdingen sees a change in Wanhal's style as he redirected his attention towards the middle class, his music becoming didactic in the sense that it employed musical figures in a clear and self-referential manner, rather than the seamless continuity from figure to figure that had characterized his earlier pieces. In this, Gjerdingen sees Wanhal as prefiguring Beethoven. Such was his success that within a few years of his symphonies being written, they were being performed around the world, and as far distant as the United States. To give one example, a 19th-century manuscript set of all the parts (except the trumpet) of the Symphony in C major, Bryan C6, was found in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In later life, however, he rarely moved from Vienna, where he was also an active teacher.

While originally featured primarily as an enemy of Superman, he has in recent years also been an enemy of the Green Lantern Corps. At times, he is also referred to as The Cyborg (not to be confused with Victor Stone a.k.a. Cyborg from Teen Titans). Publication history While the character debuted in The Adventures of Superman #465 (May 1990) and was created by Dan Jurgens, he was reintroduced as the original Cyborg Superman during the Reign of the Supermen storyline following Superman's death. Fictional character biography left Hank Henshaw first appeared as a crew member on board the doomed NASA Space Shuttle Excalibur in Superman (vol. 2) #42, and Henshaw and the other crew members were next seen in Adventures of Superman #465. Hank and the other three members of the Excalibur crew, including his wife Terri, are part of a radiation experiment designed by LexCorp that is affected by a solar flare, causing their shuttle to crash. As a result of their radiation exposure, the human bodies of two crew members were destroyed. However, their minds survived and they were able to construct new bodies out of cosmic radiation and bits of earth and wreckage from the shuttle, respectively. Initially, Henshaw and his wife suffer no ill effects from the radiation (though Hank's hair turns white), and the crew travels to Metropolis in the hopes of using LexCorp facilities to cure their mutated crewmates. During a brief battle with Superman, one crew member, now composed of radiation, becomes unhinged and flies into the Sun, destroying himself. By this time, Henshaw's body has started to rapidly decay, while his wife is beginning to phase into an alternate dimension. With Superman's help, Henshaw is able to use the LexCorp facilities to save Terri. The remaining member of the shuttle crew commits suicide, using an MRI booth to tear apart the metallic components of his body. Though Henshaw's physical body expired, he was able to transfer his consciousness into the LexCorp mainframe. Now able to control technology, Henshaw appears to his wife in a robotic body. The shock of this bizarre rebirth is too much for Terri to bear and in a fit of insanity, she jumps to her death. By this point, Henshaw's electronic consciousness has begun to disrupt Earth's communications networks. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beams his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from Krypton to Earth as an infant. He creates a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departs into outer space alone. Henshaw spends some time traveling between planets, bonding with local lifeforms to learn about the culture and history of various worlds. Henshaw comes to believe that Superman was responsible for the tragedy of the Excalibur after learning that around the time of the accident, the Man of Steel had thrown a rogue Kryptonian artificial intelligence (the Eradicator) into the Sun. Henshaw believes that this created the solar flare that resulted in the Excalibur crew's transformations (although Superman had shared this concern with Terri after he had saved her life and she had confirmed that the flares would have been triggered before Superman disposed of the Eradicator). Over time, Henshaw becomes delusional and paranoid, believing that the Man of Steel had intentionally caused the deaths of himself, his wife, and his crew, then driven him from Earth. Arriving on a planet controlled by alien overlord and Superman foe Mongul, Henshaw learns of Warworld and forcibly recruits Mongul as part of a plan for revenge against Superman. =Reign of the Supermen= Cover of Superman (vol. 2) #79. Art by Dan Jurgens. With Superman apparently dead after his battle with Doomsday, Henshaw decides to pose as him in order to destroy his reputation. To that end, the Cyborg claims to be Superman reborn, the result of the hero's body being pieced together and revived with technology. The Cyborg then uses knowledge obtained from Superman's birthing matrix to construct a body that is genetically identical to Superman's. When analyzed closely by Professor Hamilton, the Cyborg passes for the real thing, due to components within himself that include Kryptonian alloys, combined with the fact that the replaced body parts correspond with those parts of the original Superman's body that were most severely injured in his fight with Doomsday. After destroying a Superman memorial plaque in front of the Daily Planet, the Cyborg exiles Doomsday into space, prevents a nuclear meltdown, and saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. The White House then endorses the Cyborg as the 'true' Superman. When confronted by Lois Lane, the Cyborg claims his memory is \\"blurry\\", but he can see a \\"spaceship on a farm and the name Kent\\", suggesting that Henshaw may be aware of Superman's secret identity. Henshaw's arrival as Superman is simultaneous with that of three others: John Henry Irons (the self-styled Man of Steel), the Eradicator (the self-styled Last Son of Krypton), and the modern Superboy. The endorsement of the President ensures that the Cyborg eclipses the rest of the heroes claiming to be Superman's heir. During this time, two cults spring up in anticipation of Superman's return from the dead: one that deifies the Eradicator and another that venerates the Cyborg. Supporters of both eventually come to blows over which is the real Superman. =Destroying Coast City= When an alien ship appears over Coast City, the Cyborg attacks and severely injures the Eradicator, allowing Mongul's craft to destroy the city. The Cyborg also murders an entire family of vacationers trying to find a way out of the devastated area. The Cyborg was then able to convince the White House and the public that the Eradicator was responsible. After tricking and defeating Superboy, Henshaw prepares to launch a nuclear warhead intended to convert Metropolis into a second Engine City. Superboy is able to escape and warn John Henry Irons, Supergirl, and the resurrected (but powerless) original Superman of the Cyborg's plans. The quartet travels to the site of the former Coast City, and Superman (whose powers are slowly returning), Supergirl, and Steel confront Mongul and the Cyborg, while Superboy stops the missile from hitting Metropolis. While Green Lantern defeats Mongul, the Cyborg lures Superman and the Eradicator to the Engine City main reactor and attempts to kill Superman with the kryptonite that powers the engine. When Henshaw tries to kill Superman with a concentrated blast of kryptonite radiation, the Eradicator intercepts the blast at the expense of his own life. As the kryptonite energy passes through the Eradicator, the radiation is altered and acts to fully restore Superman's powers. Superman is then able to easily defeat the already weakened Cyborg by sticking his arm through Henshaw's chest, killing him and shattering his body. When Henshaw panics and states that he will \\"somehow\\" find a way to come back, a doubting Superman simply says that if Henshaw does, he will be waiting. It was later revealed that Henshaw chose to attack Coast City first because he and his late wife were former residents. This was part of an effort to erase his former life.Green Lantern (vol. 4) # 13 =Return= Hank Henshaw in Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey #1, drawn by Dan Jurgens and Brett Breeding Before exiling Doomsday into space, Henshaw had installed a device on the monster to allow him to detect if Doomsday were to ever escape. After the destruction of his Cyborg Superman form, Henshaw transfers his consciousness into this device as Doomsday is \\"the safest place in the galaxy\\" for the Cyborg to hide. Doomsday is brought on board a space cruiser and, despite frantic efforts of the crew to jettison him, kills the crew, and upon landing on Apokolips, proceeds to pillage the planet. When Superman, his power now boosted by being repowered by \\"purple kryptonite\\", arrives; Henshaw emerges by reconfiguring an armored Apokoliptian trooper, brutally murdered by Doomsday, into a new body (which, by all accounts, had its DNA overwritten with the Kryptonian DNA Henshaw had obtained while in Superman's birthing matrix, and thus still retains a portion of Superman's abilities and still looks the way the Cyborg Superman looked, except for a change in the color of the Cyborg's metallic components) and proceeds to lay siege to the planet alongside Doomsday. The Cyborg successfully takes over most of Apokolips but is captured by Darkseid's Omega Beams during a battle with Superman.Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey (1994) =Apokolips and beyond= Darkseid did not kill the Cyborg; rather, the Omega Effect captured Henshaw in a small orb, with Darkseid planning to use the Cyborg against Superman at a later date. Darkseid eventually frees Henshaw with the understanding that Henshaw is to leave Apokolips and never return. The Cyborg eventually aligns himself with an intergalactic Tribunal which is seeking to bring Superman to trial for the crimes of his ancestors. Henshaw assists the Tribunal in capturing the Eradicator, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, and Alpha Centurion, who had intended to rescue Superman. However, the Cyborg betrayed the Tribunal and attempted to conquer their planet for conversion into a new Warworld. Superman and his allies stop the Cyborg's plan and, when Henshaw's involvement in the destruction of Coast City is brought to the attention of the Tribunal, they find him guilty of genocide and sentence him to death. As an electronic consciousness, Henshaw cannot be killed by normal means and is transported beyond the event horizon of a black hole, where not even light can escape from the gravity. Rather than being destroyed, the Cyborg is transported (unknowingly by another villain, Thanos) to a Marvel Multiverse dimension designated as 616, as seen at the beginning of the Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances crossover one-shot issue. The Cyborg destroys a planet in another attempt to recreate Warworld, attracting the attention of the Silver Surfer. Their short battle is interrupted by the arrival of Parallax, who has been tracking the Cyborg for some time, seeking vengeance for the destruction of Coast City. In the confusion, Henshaw escapes and is returned to the DC Universe. Parallax undoes the destruction of the planet that Henshaw had caused using power donated from the Silver Surfer. Henshaw in his later, less Superman-based configuration. Art by left The Cyborg encounters Hal Jordan again at the Source Wall,The Final Night (1996) a nexus of statues that channels vital energy to preserve the Fourth World. Parallax uses his powers to generate representations of the victims of Coast City, which tear the Cyborg's body apart. Jordan then disperses Henshaw's consciousness, and the Cyborg is seemingly destroyed once again. During a crisis involving the Godwave, Superman (wearing his blue energy costume at the time) travels to New Genesis and encounters Henshaw again. Henshaw has taken part of the Source Wall's structure and crafted a small world made up of his memories, which he uses to taunt Superman before being defeated again. Unknown to Superman, the Cyborg stored his own consciousness in Superman's high-tech containment suit. After Superman returns to Earth, Henshaw escapes and constructs a new body, this time posing as an art teacher at a high school in an attempt to start over. He is a popular teacher and befriends the blind Ashbury Armstrong (daughter of Dirk Armstrong), but ultimately his rage towards Superman causes him to reveal his true identity and his new body is lost in a fight with Superman. To escape detection, Henshaw stores his consciousness in a clay statue. This statue is later stolen by the Toyman and the two villains join forces to kill Superman. To this end, the Cyborg designs a machine that will break Superman's energy form down into multiple components and beam them to different points in the galaxy, preventing Superman from reforming. A malfunction in the machine causes Superman to split into Superman Blue and Superman Red, the latter of whom eventually defeats and recaptures the Cyborg. The Cyborg later attempts to take over Kandor, but fails when he is defeated by Superman and sent to the Phantom Zone. Shortly after the Superman Y2K story, Henshaw escapes the Zone and attacks Superman, who was suffering from Kryptonite poisoning. Henshaw is defeated with the help of the Kandorians and sent back to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. However, he is not encountered on subsequent visits to the Zone. =Manhunters= Henshaw returns in a form similar to his original body, when he is revealed to be the Manhunters' new Grandmaster.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #11 (2006) With his influence, the Manhunters have been upgraded with organic material, most notably with blood. On the Manhunter home world of Biot, in sector 3601, Henshaw is holding captive several assumed-to-be-dead Green Lanterns, most of whom appeared to die during the Emerald Twilight saga. Henshaw has also used Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters. During the Green Lantern story arc No Fear,Green Lantern (vol. 4) #1-3 (2005) Kryptonian robots are seen servicing the Manhunters. Henshaw, the Grandmaster, allowed the Green Lantern Corps to rebuild for unspecified reasons as a part of his master plan. While Henshaw explains that he first encountered the Manhunters around the time he was imprisoned in the Source Wall by Parallax, it has yet to be revealed how the Cyborg was able to escape the Phantom Zone and take control of Biot. Henshaw is defeated when Biot explodes, destroying most of his body aside from his head. Henshaw's head is then brought by a Guardian back to Oa so that they can learn of how he was able to take control of Biot, what he has learned from the Manhunters and to learn about \\"the 52\\"Green Lantern (vol. 4) #15 (referring to the 51 alternate Earths created during the second Crisis as well as their own reality). It is also revealed that the Cyborg knows of the 52, though exactly how he came by this knowledge is not made completely clear. It is stated that he has explored \\"The Bleed\\"; the space between dimensions, which could have occurred either when he was imprisoned there, when he was imprisoned in the Source Wall, or in his past exploration of the Marvel Universe. =Sinestro Corps= Cover art for Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman #1, by right Henshaw's head is taken by the Sinestro Corps after their invasion of Oa to Qward. Henshaw is later seen as a herald of the newly returned Anti-Monitor. He reconstructs his cyborg body and replaces the S-symbol on his chest with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He now wields ten Qwardian power rings.Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 (August 2007) It is revealed that Henshaw has joined the Sinestro Corps so that the Anti-Monitor can later kill him and allow him to rest in peace.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #22 Henshaw was the focus of the Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman one-shot that was released on October 3, 2007.DC Comics' solicitation for the Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman one-shotReview of Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Cyborg-Superman #1 , Silver Bullet Comic Books In this book, Henshaw and his Manhunters head to Earth to assist the Sinestro Corps in their attack. En route, Henshaw stops leading the Manhunters which continue to their preprogrammed destinations. As he watches them go, he remembers everything that has happened to him, from their dreadful shuttle accident to his wife's suicide when she sees him in his robot form. He finishes this journey down memory lane by going to his wife's grave. He digs her corpse out and rips it into two, shouting that all he wants is not to be with her, but for these memories to fade. Meanwhile, the Manhunters begin an assault on the JLA satellite. Hawkgirl, Black Lightning, and Red Arrow retaliate; however, all three are neutralized when Henshaw assists in the attack and he successfully tampers with the mechanics of the satellite core. As the satellite is thrown out of orbit, Superman appears and engages Henshaw in battle. Their fight continues on Earth, while Sinestro transports his crew and his ship from the anti-matter universe. At first Superman seems to have the upper hand; however after two punches, Henshaw strikes with great power and rage, punching him through the Statue of Liberty. By the end, Henshaw has Superman in a choke hold, thinking that the victory is near. He is later seen briefly in Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman-Prime, having presumably been beaten back by the combined strength of Superman, Supergirl, and Power Girl.Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman-Prime #1 (2007) When the Green Lantern Corps decide to detonate New Warworld and the central power battery of the Sinestro Corps to destroy the Anti-Monitor, Henshaw allows himself to be trapped behind a shield and exposed to the massive explosion. Before he is destroyed, however, he thanks the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25 Most of Henshaw's body survived the explosion, but it took further damage when Superman-Prime hurled the Anti- Monitor into space. The upper part of his skull was retrieved by the android Manhunters. Unable to detect any life signs and confused without his leadership, the Manhunters reanimated the brain of the Cyborg Superman. He shed a tear when he realized he was still alive. =Death and retrieval= In the Brightest Day crossover, Henshaw would eventually return and work with the Alpha Lanterns as they attempted to augment every Green Lantern, including Ganthet, into an Alpha.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #48 (May 2010)Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #49 (June 2010) This was apparently at the suggestion of the robed figure holding Ion and Parallax, who told him that Ganthet held the knowledge to destroy him permanently, after Henshaw's attempts to provoke Nekron into killing him during the Blackest Night failed because he lacked a heart to attract Nekron's interest.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #50 (July 2010) By threatening to make the Alpha Lanterns kill themselves if Ganthet does not cooperate, Henshaw forces Ganthet to work on reversing the augments that turned the Green Lanterns into Alpha Lanterns, hoping that he can use the resulting information to restore his original mortal body.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #51 (August 2010) Henshaw was seemingly killed when his lifeforce was finally separated from his nearly indestructible body by the combined full powered blasts of several Lanterns and Ganthet, and appeared on the mental plane of Alpha-Lantern Boodikka in an attempt to take her bio-mechanical body over, where both beings were their original, un-powered selves. Her essence, gifted with her innate, formidable combat skills, engaged his in one-on-one combat, and she quickly overpowered and killed his astral form. Afterwards, however, Ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her. Boodikka claims this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed him to see her as she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not by what she is (an Alpha Lantern).Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010) In the Reign of Doomsday crossover, Boodikka was attacked by Doomsday while investigating the remains of New Krypton, and Henshaw was revealed to still be alive inside her, forming a new body out of her internal circuitry to fight Doomsday while Batman and Supergirl were trying to repair Boodikka.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #55 (March 2011) Henshaw uses his abilities to take control of the JLA Watchtower and uses the satellite's defenses in an attempt to kill Doomsday, reasoning that if he could manage to destroy the creature that killed Superman, it would prove once and for all that he is superior to Superman. After the creature is violently dismembered by Henshaw, it somehow absorbs the nanotechnology from Henshaw's body and repairs itself, becoming a new being dubbed Cyborg Doomsday. Cyborg Doomsday somehow manages to negate Henshaw's ability to repair himself, which leads Henshaw to believe that he might finally meet his demise. Supergirl bursts onto the scene and attempts to stop Doomsday herself, but Henshaw fires an energy blast at her, stating that he would not allow her to defeat the creature that had humiliatingly beaten him only moments before. With Supergirl distracted, Cyborg Doomsday knocks her out and then tears one of Henshaw's arms off before departing with both of his unconscious captives.Superman/Batman Annual #5 (April 2011) Trapped in a satellite with the other Supermen, the heroes conclude that Henshaw has been trapped with them to keep them disorganized due to the tensions caused by his presence, prompting Henshaw to depart and search the satellite himself. After Superman arrives to rescue his comrades, Henshaw reveals that the Doomsdays that fought them were actually all clones of the original created by Lex Luthor.Action Comics (vol. 1) #900 Henshaw tries to fight them, but Superman rips his central node off, knowing that they would not survive a confrontation with the Doomsdays.Action Comics (vol. 1) #901 After the Doomsday clones are sent to another dimension, Henshaw is in custody of S.T.A.R. Labs.Action Comics (vol. 1) #904 =The New 52 and DC Rebirth = In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a fully human Henshaw appears as a doctor working for the Advanced Prosthetic Research Centre and colleague of Caitlin Fairchild. He is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan.Team 7 (vol. 2) #5 (April 2013) While in space and after saving a planet called I'noxia, Supergirl discovers an amnesiac Cyborg Superman living there. This version is revealed to be Zor-El, who survives Krypton's destruction and is reconfigured as a half-human half-machine by Brainiac to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe. His heart was switched with that of a human to remove his ability to be affected by kryptonite.Supergirl (vol. 6) #21 (August 2013) When the human Henshaw is sent into space on the Excalibur on a long-term mission, he is monitored by the Clark Kent and Lois Lane of the pre-Flashpoint universe, who were trapped in the New 52 world following the Convergence, with Superman seeking to prevent the rise of some of his former adversaries in this world. When the Excalibur crashes after returning from a ten-year journey to Jupiter and back, Superman saves the ship, but is puzzled to see that Henshaw is the only person on board.Superman: Lois & Clark #1 Taking Henshaw to a base he has established in the Arctic regions to better assess if this Henshaw is a threat or not, Superman is briefly forced to face both Henshaw and a new foe called Blanque, who possesses powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities and was also kept in the fortress, but once Blanque is focused on fighting Superman, Henshaw helps Superman defeat this new foe with the weapons of a spaceship that was also kept in the fortress. It is later revealed that Henshaw acquired part of an object known as 'the Oblivion Stone' on Jupiter, with Superman forced to face an alien warrior seeking both Henshaw's part of the stone and another part kept in the fortress, but Superman drives her off, Henshaw claiming when questioned that he had no memory of anything that happened on the Excalibur or between it landing and him being discovered.Superman: Lois & Clark #8 After the reality disruption caused by Mister Mxyzptlk caused the histories of the pre-Flashpoint and New 52 Superman to merge during the DC Rebirth reboot, Henshaw's memories of his past as the Cyborg Superman were restored. With this knowledge, he set out to assemble various old foes of Superman like Metallo, the Eradicator, Blanque, and his old 'ally' Mongul to form the Superman Revenge Squad before using the Oblivion Stone to restore his body to its Cyborg Superman state. He even expressed interest into recruiting General Zod to his group.Action Comics #980 The new Superman Revenge Squad then set out for Kal-El's Fortress of Solitude to obtain the Phantom Zone Projector, still in need of Zod's Kryptonian army to defeat the Superman family. What the Cyborg did not realize was that Zod was using the Squad to achieve his own ends. After finding his family trapped within the Zone's confines, Zod betrayed them, leaving Henshaw trapped within the Phantom Zone.Action Comics #984 He would soon be released by his hated enemy, Superman, on account of an epiphany Clark had while on a time traveling excursion with Booster Gold. To keep the maddened bionic menace docile while he came up with a more humane means of detaining him, Superman gave Henshaw a Kryptonian memory crystal that would pacify the Cyborg Superman's rage by letting him relive his happiest memories in an fantasy world fabricated by his own mind.Action Comics #999 This self-imposed incarceration would not last, however, as the demented machine man found another means of escape. While he was trapped, a part of his mind escaped into the universe, where he sought to manipulate the Guardians and their appointed intergalactic law enforcement bureau, the Green Lantern Corps, to facilitate his escape.Green Lanterns #51 Even trapped within Superman's Kryptonian dwelling, Henshaw was able to influence the Central Power Battery back on Oa a universe away. From within his cell, he orchestrated a mystery surrounding the death of a Guardian to find a powerful weapon, the Phantom Ring.Green Lanterns #54 After hacking into the Lantern ring network, Henshaw used the unsuspecting Corpsmen Simon Baz, to break the Cyborg out of the Fortress of Solitude and deliver him the Phantom Ring. Though Henshaw was able to capture the Green Lanterns as his hacking into their main central Power Battery rendered their rings useless,Green Lanterns #55 however due to John Stewart and Simon Baz using the Kryptonian weapons that Simon borrowed from the Fortress, along with the fact that any Green Lantern who had not recharged their rings prior to Henshaw hacking into the main battery (such as Hal Jordan and Kilowog) were immune, allowing them to fight back.Green Lanterns #56 In retaliation, Henshaw retreated to Earth with the intention to recreate the disaster of destroying Coast City with the power of the Phantom Ring. With the help of other Green Lantern Corpsmen (such as Sodam Yat), Henshaw was defeated and forced to retreat with the Phantom Ring.Green Lanterns #57 Powers and abilities Hank Henshaw is a \\"technomorph.\\" Unlike a simple technopath which can physically manipulate technology with their mind, Henshaw can extend his consciousness into any machine.Action Comics (vol. 1) #691 (September 1938) Through his technomorphing ability, Henshaw also gained Kryptonian powers similar to Superman, while editing out weaknesses such as vulnerability to kryptonite. He can even commandeer complex alien technology such as power rings, controlling and assimilating the energy fueling the rings and their batteries. Other versions Hank Henshaw appears in the first arc of Smallville Season 11, a comic book continuation of the television series Smallville.DC Comics Henshaw, depicted as a heroic pilot that Lex Luthor sends to pilot his new anti-alien Guardian Defense Platform, nearly dies when the Guardian Platform blasts its weapons inside the shuttle, causing a dangerous radiation leak. Superman rescues the crew (along with Hank's wife, Terri), but Hank gets the radiation- spewing shuttle safely away so civilians will not get injured by it crashing. Superman gets him out as soon as he can, but he is left covered in third- degree burns and suffering from locked-in syndrome.Smallville: Season 11 #2 Henshaw tried to kill Lex, but Terri managed to convince him that it was Superman's fault (as he hadn't managed to save him in time, despite previously having moved a planet). So, when Superman appeared, Henshaw began to fight him in his new S.T.A.R. Labs robot body. The two fought for a few minutes, until Superman separated the head of Henshaw's robot body from the rest of the drone. Afterwards, Henshaw calmed down and apologized to Superman. His head was placed in secure storage at S.T.A.R. Labs. Over the next few months, Henshaw became close friends with Tess Mercer (who had recently had also had her consciousness uploaded into a computer), who would frequently visit him. Due to his own experiences, Henshaw urged her not to waste this second chance.Smallville Season 11: Chaos #2 Henshaw remained at S.T.A.R. Labs until Eclipso attacked the city. Superman had been sent to another universe, leaving the city defenseless. Henshaw broke out and made himself a new robot body. He joined forced with Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) and Superboy (Kon-El) and fought Eclipso. After the defeat of Eclipso, Henshaw took it upon himself to get the Eclipso diamond away from Earth. With the help of the Green Lantern, Henshaw was sent deep into space towards an unknown destination.Smallville Season 11: Chaos #5 * Hank Henshaw also appears in the Elseworlds story, JLA: Act of God.JLA: Act of God #1-3 * In the crossover story Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future, Henshaw learns of the existence of Skynet in the future and uses a salvaged Terminator skull to provide Skynet with information on Superman's weaknesses, subsequently allying with a T-X unit to eliminate John Connor and the Superman Family. Despite Henshaw merging with the T-X to battle Superman, he is forced to withdraw when Supergirl infects the hybrid with a computer virus developed by Lex Luthor to use against the Terminators that damages the T-X beyond repair. In other media =Television= In the Legion of Super Heroes episode \\"Message in a Bottle\\", a Superman robot that resembles the Cyborg Superman appears as the property caretaker of the Fortress of Solitude in the 31st century and is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. * Hank Henshaw appears in the series Supergirl, portrayed by David Harewood. In season one episode \\"Human for a Day\\", the leader of the D.E.O., previously thought to be Hank Henshaw, reveals that he is actually J'onn J'onzz, an alien refugee. The original Henshaw saw all aliens as dangerous and founded the D.E.O. to hunt them down. Upon learning of J'onn, he became obsessed with killing him. While hunting the alien in Peru, D.E.O. agent Jeremiah Danvers found J'onn and quickly realized his true, harmless nature. Henshaw later found the two fraternizing and attacked J'onn, ignoring Jeremiah's pleas and insistence that J'onn was not dangerous. Following a scuffle, Henshaw fatally stabbed Jeremiah, before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. J'onn took Henshaw's form to ensure humane treatment of aliens by the DEO as well as to watch over Danvers' daughters Alex and Kara. In season two episode \\"The Darkest Place\\", Henshaw is revealed to be alive, having been turned into a self-proclaimed \\"Cyborg Superman\\" by Project Cadmus, although unlike in the comics he retains his original appearance with metal armour rather than basically uploading himself into a copy of Superman's form. Supergirl Episode The Darkest Hour He works with Cadmus leader Lillian Luthor throughout the season until her arrest in the finale. In the episode \\"Alex in Wonderland,\\" a virtual reality version of Henshaw stole a warhead in a plot to regain the D.E.O. After capturing Kara, he is defeated by Alex as Supergirl. =Film= DC's direct-to-DVD movie Superman: Doomsday, based on \\"The Death of Superman\\" storyline, features a variation on the Cyborg Superman character. One of the many changes is a streamlined cast which cuts the four Superman imposters, including Henshaw. Elements from three of the four impostors (Henshaw, Superboy, and the Eradicator), were combined into the Superman clone created by Lex Luthor in the film. * Henshaw is portrayed by Elijah Wood in the 2011 short film The Death and Return of Superman. * In the 11th installment of the DC Animated Movie Universe, The Death of Superman, he appears in the beginning in human form, where his Excalibur shuttle is destroyed by the asteroid carrying Doomsday to Earth. He initially refused to evacuate believing Superman would come to the rescue. This obsession led to the death of his crew. During the last post-credit scene he appears as Cyborg Superman. Hank is voiced by Patrick Fabian. * Henshaw returns prominently in the sequel Reign of the Supermen as the main antagonist, with Patrick Fabian returning as his consciousness and Jerry O‚ÄôConnell as his new alter ego Cyborg Superman. Unlike the original storyline, where Henshaw essentially created his new body himself and had forcibly recruited Mongul as his associate, here Henshaw is presented as a brainwashed minion of Darkseid, who sent Doomsday to Earth to weaken the Justice League. Upon recovering the remains of Hank Henshaw, Darkseid resurrected him back and transferred Henshaw's consciousness into a cyborg body while indoctrinating him to resent Superman's failure to save the shuttle. After the Justice League is apparently killed saving the U.S. President's life from Parademons, Henshaw tricks Metropolis into letting him create a group of cyborgs who are actually brainwashed into his drones, the 'drones' eventually coming together to create a Boom Tube that will allow Darkseid to dispatch his forces to Earth en masse. Fortunately, the other three Supermen are able to revive the original and bring him back to Metropolis, where Superman engages Henshaw in battle while Steel, Superboy, Lois and Luthor bring back the Justice League from the dimension they were banished to. Henshaw nearly kills Superman as they fight in the Justice League's new Watchtower, but Lois is able to give Superman a boost by lowering the satellite's sun shields, allowing Superman to damage Henshaw. Henshaw's regenerative systems make him almost indestructible, forcing Superman to stab Henshaw in the head with a crystal containing the essence of the Eradicator, which apparently destroys Henshaw's consciousness. =Video games= Cyborg Superman is a playable character as one of the Supermen included in the SNES & Genesis video game The Death and Return of Superman in 1994. He is also the final boss of the game. * Cyborg Superman appears as a boss character in 2002's Superman: The Man of Steel. * Cyborg Superman appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us, voiced by George Newbern. He appears as a downloadable alternate skin for Superman and has Regime Superman's dialogue. * Henshaw also appears in DC Universe Online in the ninth DLC, \\"War of the Light Part I\\". As a hero, you fight him and Sinestro in \\"Assault & Battery\\", and again as a boss in \\"Mist Recovery\\". As a villain, he assists the players in collecting Mist and fighting Kyle Rayner in \\"Mist Recovery\\". * Cyborg Superman appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Travis Willingham. =Radio= British radio producer Dirk Maggs produced a Superman radio series for BBC Radio 5 in the 1990s. When the \\"Death of Superman\\" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a faithful but streamlined version of the tale, featuring Stuart Milligan as Clark Kent/Superman, Lorelei King as Lois Lane, and William Hootkins as Lex Luthor. American actor Kerry Shale was cast as the villainous Henshaw and as Superboy. The story arc was packaged for sale on cassette and CD as Superman: Doomsday and Beyond in the UK and as Superman Lives! in the USA. =Miscellaneous= During the DC/Marvel crossover Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances, Henshaw is briefly shown in the Marvel Universe, having destroyed a planet due to the tidal stresses generated when he tried to convert it into a new Warworld. He is confronted by the Silver Surfer, who once spared the planet when he acted as a Herald to Galactus. Henshaw is intrigued at the Surfer's reference to Galactus' power, but the fight is interrupted by Hal Jordan- currently Parallax-seeking revenge for Henshaw's destruction of Coast City. It is later revealed that Thanos was responsible for Henshaw's appearance in the Marvel Universe; having discovered the multiversal rift created by the destruction of Oa, Thanos plucked Henshaw from the DC Universe to test the rift, later sending Terrax to the DC Universe to test Kyle Rayner as part of his plan. In the subsequent crossover Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction, Reed Richards and his team are forced into an uneasy alliance with Henshaw when Galactus kidnaps Superman and transforms him into his Herald. In conversation with Susan Storm, Henshaw points out the \\"ironic\\" similarity between his origin and the FF's. Eventually, Superman is released from his position as Herald when his will proves to be stronger than Galactus' reprogramming, due to the sheer scale of the impact that Krypton's destruction has had on him as a person. The story concludes with Galactus blasting Henshaw with a ray that turns him into a simple metal rod in response to his pleas for perfection, after the discovery that Henshaw was responsible for Superman coming to the Marvel Universe; Henshaw sent Superman a fake message from Jor- El to suggest that Galactus was involved in Krypton's destruction, seeking the power of becoming a Herald after learning of Galactus in his encounter with the Surfer. * Hank Henshaw appeared in issue #19 of the Batman: The Brave and the Bold comics.

She first came to public attention in 2003 as a contestant on the singing competition show American Idol. Davis began performing in Rent on Broadway soon afterward, and was a member of the cast for four years. In 2011 Davis reached the top 8 on the first season of singing competition The Voice.  Early life and career  Frenchie Davis performing at Broadway on Broadway in 2006. Davis was born in Washington, DC and raised in Los Angeles, CA. She graduated from Howard University in 2014 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. In the year 2000, she began her performing career in productions of Little Shop of Horrors and Jesus Christ Superstar with the Freilichtspiele Theatre Company in Schwabisch Hall, Germany.  American Idol  Davis was a contestant on the second season of American Idol in 2003, but was disqualified early in the season due to topless photos taken earlier in her career. According to Davis, she was up-front about her pictures: : \\"When I first discovered that I had made it to Hollywood and found out I would be competing to get into the top 30 and then later in the top 12, they had given us all this paperwork to fill out, background checks and that whole thing. So when we were doing that I had a discussion with some members of the production staff and I exposed to them a piece of my past; that when I was 19 years old, I took some pictures and that‚Äôs not the person I am [anymore]. I wanted to be up-front about it. We talked about it and then nothing happened\\". The Idol staff took no action then, but two months later, they decided that Davis's participation would be inappropriate. \\"They had decided that because American Idol was a family show, that they could not have me on the show because of the pictures I had taken ‚Äìthough they had never seen the pictures,\\" she told EuroWeb. She also added that no one was able to find the pictures in question as the website that featured them had been taken down. = Double-standards controversy = In 2007, revealing pictures of season six American Idol contender Antonella Barba surfaced on the internet, but Barba was kept on the show (though she was voted off shortly afterward). Many drew parallels to Davis's earlier situation. In an interview conducted for The New York Post on Monday, March 5, 2007, Davis said, : \\"I couldn't help but notice the difference between the manner in which she was dealt with and how I was dealt with.... I think it's fantastic if Idol has evolved, and I think it's fantastic she won't have to go through what I went through four years ago ‚Ä¶ but if the rules have changed, I believe there should be something to make up for the fact that I was humiliated needlessly.\\" The discrepancy was discussed on talk show The View on March 6, 2007. Co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck argued that the difference was that Davis was paid for her pictures whereas Barba was not. Co-host Rosie O'Donnell disagreed, saying, \\"I think it's racist. I do... I think it's because she's black\\". American Idol was also accused of racism by Project Islamic H.O.P.E. activist Najee Ali: \\"obvious that it's a racial bias... when you have a situation where a black contestant is punished and a similar situation happens to a white contestant and there is no punishment and they're allowed to continue on the show.\\"  Post-Idol career  After American Idol, Davis appeared in the Broadway musical Rent in 2003. She sang the solo in the opening song of Act Two, Seasons of Love, and in ensemble roles such as Mrs. Jefferson (Joanne's mom), a woman with bags, a coat vendor, Mrs. Marquez (Mimi's mom) and others. She also occasionally played the part of Joanne. On June 1, 2005, Davis returned to her previous role in the Broadway production of Rent. Davis had previously announced that she would leave Rent in May 2007, but announced her final performance following a mid-April 2007 show. During the weeks leading up to the April 29 performance of Rent's 10-year reunion, Davis appeared in an iTunes Podcast (Rent: The PodCast). She also joined the original cast for a special encore performance. In 2004, Davis was cast in the role of Effie in a West Coast- touring production of Dreamgirls, which appeared in Sacramento, San Jose, and Seattle, and later went to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. From August 3‚Äì19, 2007, Davis starred alongside Miche Braden and JMichael in the role of Mahalia Jackson in the Hartford Stage production of Mahalia: A Gospel Musical, written by Tom Stolz and directed by Jeremy B. Cohen. In 2008, Davis, along with fellow second-season American Idol participants Ruben Studdard and Trenyce Cobbins, starred in the 30th-anniversary national tour of the musical revue Ain't Misbehavin'. The tour ran until May 2009, and was nominated for a Grammy award in the Best Musical Show Album category. In the fall of 2010, Frenchie was cast in the role of the Fairy Godmother in Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (Enchanted Edition) at the Berkeley Playhouse, the resident theatre company at the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts in Berkeley, California.  The Voice  In 2011, Davis competed in the first season of reality competition series The Voice. In the first episode, she performed \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" by Katy Perry, advancing to the next round as a member of mentor/judge Christina Aguilera's team of 8. On the May 10 episode, Frenchie competed in a sing off against Tarralyn Ramsey, both singing \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" by Beyonc√©. Frenchie won and made it to the next round. On the June 7 episode, Frenchie performed \\"When Love Takes Over\\" by David Guetta and Kelly Rowland. She was told, \\"You may very well have the strongest voice in this whole competition.\\" In the next week, it was announced that Frenchie did not win the fan vote from the previous week's performance, which would have allowed her to move on in the competition. However, Aguilera used her own vote to move Frenchie onto The Voice's Elite 8. On the June 21 episode, featuring the Showdown of the Elite 8, Davis performed \\"Like a Prayer\\" by Madonna. Frenchie Davis was eliminated during the semi-finals, finishing fifth overall. She did, however, join the other members of the final eight contestants of the show: Javier Colon, Dia Frampton, Vicci Martinez, Beverly McClellan, Casey Weston, Xenia and Nakia on a U.S. tour summer 2011.  Post-Voice career  In December 2012, Frenchie starred in the musical God Doesn't Mean You Get To Live Forever at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in New York with legendary pastor Dr. James A. Forbes Jr. and Gregory Charles Royal. In 2014 she made her film debut in the comedy film Dumbbells. In 2017, Davis starred as Henri in The View UpStairs - an off-Broadway musical about the UpStairs Lounge arson attack that killed 50 patrons of a gay bar in New Orleans. She was also a winner of the Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz Award from CLAGS: the Center for LGBTQ Studies (formerly known as Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies) at The Graduate Center, CUNY. The award is given to an LGBTQ Activist who promotes Queer Studies outside of academia.https://www.gc.cuny.edu/All-GC- Events/Calendar/Detail?id=40367  Recording career  Frenchie is a featured artist in the Tony Moran single \\"You Are\\" that was released December 1, 2009, and peaked at number 5 on the Billboard hot clubplay chart. \\"You Are\\" was the debut single from Moran's album Mix Magic Music. On September 4, 2012, Davis released her debut solo single, \\"Love's Got A Hold On Me\\". The song peaked at #12 on the Billboard Dance Chart. The song was billed as the first single from an upcoming solo album, Just Frenchie, but the album was not released.  Personal life  Davis possesses a vocal range of Lyric Mezzo-Soprano. In 2012, Davis came out as bisexual. She continues to be a strong and outspoken advocate for the Bisexual community, LGBTQ Youth and for LGBTQ People of Colour. In 2013 she was the featured performer at the National LGBTQ Task Force's 25th National Conference on LGBT Equality: Creating Change in Atlanta GA where she explained that she had come out for all of the young LGBT people. \\"It's so wonderful to see all the young people here. You all are the reason that I chose to be out. Because it is important that you see people in the public eye who are not ashamed of who they are. It is ok to be true to you.\\" In 2014 Davis created a stir when she spoke out bluntly in response to the verdict in the Shooting of Jordan Davis by Michael Dunn where the jury deadlocked on the charge of first-degree murder, saying \\"As an LGBT woman of color, I am having an extremely difficult time grasping WHY Matthew Shephard‚Äôs life is so much more valuable than Trayvon‚Äôs or Jordan‚Äôs????!?!?! Help me understand, y‚Äôall! Help me understand\\". In popular culture Davis was impersonated by guest host Queen Latifah on the March 8, 2003, episode of sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live; Davis was lampooned for her nude photo scandal, brash attitude and melismatic singing style.Live! With Regis and Kelly, SNL Transcripts Awards and Recognitions In June 2017, Davis received the Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz award from CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies - an award that is given to individuals who promote Queer Studies in their work or activism.

Originally established 1931 as an extension of the University of Delaware Foreign Study Plan, the Junior Year in Munich program was reopened in 1953 by Wayne State University as the first junior year abroad program for US undergraduates in postwar Germany. By December 1966, Wayne State University President William Keast had visited Germany (and Poland) to gain first-hand knowledge of the University's two Junior Year Abroad programs, one at the University of Munich, and the other at the University of Freiburg. He spoke with the directors of these two Universities, as well as those at the University of Bonn and the Free University of Berlin, to explore the possibility of joint exchange programs with Wayne State University. President Keast reported that both programs were running effectively, and that \\"they enjoy the confidence and esteem of the German professors and administrators who are involved in them.\\" The University of Munich program (the older of the two), and run exclusively by Wayne State University, reported 82 American students, from all over the U.S. (including Alaska and Hawaii) in residence. Attending courses entirely in German (and those available to German students as well) in their major field of study at Wayne, Keast reported that the University of Munich's responses to the program had been favorable, and that up to 100 spaces had been authorized in Munich for students from the program. President Keast also noted that Wayne State University's student representation in the program was low, due largely to the expense to students. Although a scholarship program supported some students who excelled but could not afford to participate in the program, enlargement of those scholarship funds was desirable to increase the opportunities for Wayne State students.Keast, W. (1966, December 15). European Trip. Wayne State University, Board of Governors. Official Proceedings, Vol. 11, pp. 1316-1318. In 1967 the JYM program was approved by the LMU Munich Academic Senate as an affiliated academic institute, and was conferred the title ‚ÄúJunior Year in Munich an der Universit√§t M√ºnchen‚Äù by LMU Munich in 1974 when the Bavarian State Ministry of Culture approved the program as an official course of study (Teil-Studiengang) at the university. Students are enrolled at LMU Munich where they take coursework related to their degree studies in the US. Additional area studies courses and advanced language instruction are provided by the JYM program. Students are immersed in German language and culture by living alongside other university students in Studentenstadt Freimann. More than 3500 students from 500 US colleges and universities have participated in the Junior Year in Munich program since 1953. Directing the JYM program today are Mark Ferguson (Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison), program director in Detroit, and Hans-Peter S√∂der (Ph.D. Cornell University), resident director in Munich.

As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape. Early life and education Jos√© Mart√≠nez Ruiz was born in the village of Mon√≤ver, Spain in the province of Alicante on 8 June 1873. He was the oldest of nine children and enjoyed reading in his youth. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of Romero Robledo. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby Petrel. From the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers (Piarists) in his father's home town of Yecla in the province of Murcia. From 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the University of Valencia, but did not complete his studies. Thereafter he began to write, publishing a monograph on literary criticism in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal El pueblo, edited by Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez. He became interested in the ideas of Karl Krause, who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism. In 1895, Ruiz published Anarquistas literarios and Notas sociales, in which he presented the main anarchist theories of the time. During this time he was a political radical. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister Antonio Maura, who fought the culture of \\"caciques\\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the Mauristas, who wanted him as a new head of state of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of King Alfonso XIII. Career, writing and political evolution A pencil sketch of Azor√≠n as drawn by leftRuiz‚Äôs journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper El Pa√≠s until he was dismissed for his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine La Campa√±a, and other Spanish journals including El Progreso (\\"Progress\\"), and El Imparcial (\\"The impartial\\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including anarchist ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating aesthetics and faith. However, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book El alma castellana (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, La ruta de Don Quijote (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, Una hora de Espa√±a 1560‚Äì1590 (Spain's Hour, 1560‚Äì1590) capture the essence of being Spanish. He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more nihilist, though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using irony to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political conservatism In 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, La voluntad (Volition), followed by Antonio Azor√≠n, and Las confesiones de un peque√±o fil√≥sofo (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as C√°ndido (in honor of Voltaire) and Ahrim√°n (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \\"Azor√≠n\\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \\"timeless\\". He married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children. By 1913 he was writing for ABC, the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on ‚ÄúLa generaci√≥n de 1898‚Äù (Generation of 98), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.√Åvila by Juan de Echevarr√≠a Ruiz served as a conservative deputy in the Cortes Generales from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of Gen. Primo de Rivera, though he never opposed him publicly. He had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as Al margen de los cl√°sicos (Marginal Notes to the Classics), Don Juan and Do√±a In√©s, helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public. In 1924, he was elected to the Real Academia Espa√±ola. His first of a dozen plays, Old Spain, appeared in 1926, followed by Brandy mucho brandy and La comedia del arte, but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, El Clamor (The Cry), led to the leadership of the Asociaci√≥n de la Prensa expelling him, an act which Azor√≠n likened to that of the Inquisition. He began to be influenced by the avant- garde movement, experimenting in a personal version of surrealism in a short trilogy, Lo invisible (The Invisible). The outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned ABC to write for the republican newspapers El Sol, La Libertad and Ahora). He edited Revista de Occidente, founded by Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936. At the outset of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Azor√≠n fled to Paris, where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper La Naci√≥n. A book reflecting on this period of exile, Espa√±oles en Par√≠s, was published in 1939. When he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \\"inner exile\\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the Franco regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (tarjeta de periodista), but was supported by Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er, at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the Falange. Accepting Franco‚Äôs regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal V√©rtice. He contributed again to ABC from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including Pensando en Espa√±a and Sintiendo Espa√±a. = Later life = In his old age, Azor√≠n became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in El cine y el momento, and claiming that \\"Cinema is the greatest form of art\\". He died in Madrid, Spain on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93. The political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azor√≠n, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.

The contemporary Mille Lacs Band reservation has significant land holdings in Mille Lacs, Pine, Aitkin and Crow Wing counties, as well as other land holdings in Kanabec, Morrison, and Otter Tail Counties. Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is also the name of a formal Indian reservation established in 1855. It is one of the two formal reservations on which the contemporary Mille Lacs Band retains land holdings. The contemporary Mille Lacs band includes several aboriginal Ojibwe bands and villages, whose members reside in communities throughout central Minnesota. Reservations =Mille Lacs Lake Indian Reservation= The main reservation of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is the Mille Lacs Lake Indian Reservation (Misi-zaaga'iganiing in the Ojibwe language), at , and commonly referred to as the \\"Mille Lacs Indian Reservation\\", at the southern end of Mille Lacs Lake and composes about of land (commonly rounded in citations as \\"61,000 acres\\"), consisting of Township 42 North, Ranges 25, 26 and 27 West, and Township 43 North, Range 27 West, and islands in the southern part of Mille Lacs Lake. Before the raising of the lake level, United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewa Indians (229 U.S. 498 (1913)) cites the reservation as being of land. It was initially established in 1855 under the Treaty of Washington () for the Mille Lacs Indians and other Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe) Bands of Indians. Under later treaties and statutes the reservation was reserved for the exclusive occupancy of the Mille Lacs Band, and was later opened to non-Indian timber harvesting and settlement. The US Census Bureau designates this reservation as part of \\"2270: Mille Lacs Indian Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land\\". This reservation contains the communities of Neyaashiing (Vineland) and Chi- minising (Isle). Neyaashiing houses the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Government Center, Nay-Ah-Shing Lower and Upper Schools and the Ne-Ia-Shing Clinic. It hosts Minnesota Historical Society's Mille Lacs Indian Museum. Grand Casino Mille Lacs is also located in Neyaashiing. The central offices for Woodland National Bank, which is owned by the Mille Lacs Band, and the offices of the Band's Circle of Health supplementary Health Insurance, are both located in Onamia, Minnesota, within the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. Chi-minising houses the Chiminising Community Center and District IIa Government Services Center. The reservation is located in Kathio Township, South Harbor Township, and Isle Harbor Township in Mille Lacs County. Other lands held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is also found, contiguous to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, in southwest corner of Idun Township in Aitkin County. =Sandy Lake Indian Reservation= The contemporary Mille Lacs Indian Band also has land holdings with the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation (Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag in the Ojibwe language) in Aitkin County, which surrounds Big Sandy Lake and comprises about of land. Like Misi- zaaga'iganiing, it too was initially established in 1855 under the Treaty of Washington for the Mississippi Bands of Chippewa Indians. Under a later treaty it was reserved for the exclusive occupancy of the Sandy Lake Band, and it was later opened to non-Indian settlement. The US Census Bureau designates this reservation as \\"2385: Sandy Lake Indian Reservation\\". Today, nearly all of the land within this reservation is non-Native American owned. The Gaa- mitaawangaagamaag community of the historical Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa is located adjacent to and within the northern portion of the reservation. The Manoominikaan-zaaga'iganiing community of the historical Rice Lake band of Mississippi Chippewa is located adjacent to the reservation on the southern portion of the reservation. The United States Army Corps of Engineers operate a small flood-control dam within this Indian Reservation. The reservation is located in parts of Libby, Shamrock, Turner, and Workman Townships in Aitkin County. =Other reservation holdings= Aggregated as part of the US Census Bureau designated \\"2270: Mille Lacs Indian Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land\\", Mille Lacs Indian Reservation have scatted trust parcels less than each in Pine, Kanabec, southern Aitkin, Crow Wing and Morrison Counties, Minnesota. In addition, Mille Lacs Indian Reservation maintains the land upkeep on the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe ricing parcel at Star Lake. Furthermore, each Minnesota Chippewa Tribe member reservation, including the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, hold equal one-sixth (1/6) interest on all Minnesota Chippewa Tribe member reservations, though asserting jurisdiction only on their own reservation. Districts Due to the large territorial spread of the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, the Mille Lacs Band's statutes divide its territory into three administrative districts and one special services district. =District I= The Neyaashiing District (District I) serves the Band members living in the western two-thirds of the Misi-zaaga'iganiing and service area from that portion of the reservation. In addition, any requested services outside of the pre-defined service districts are coordinated though this district. Its administrative center is located in Neyaashiing Community (Vineland, Minnesota), a Census-designated community located approximately north of Onamia, Minnesota. =District II= Gaa- mitaawangaagamaag District (District II) serves the Band members living in the eastern one-third of the Misi-zaaga'iganiing Reservation, all of Gaa- mitaawangaagamaag Reservation, the Manoominikaan-zaaga'iganiing Community and the Minisinaakwaang Community and service area from those locations. This district is further sub-divided into two sub-districts: Districts IIa and IIb. District IIa is associated with the Chi-minising Community (Isle, Minnesota). District IIb comprises the rest of District II. The Minisinaakwaang Community (East Lake, Minnesota) is located approximately south of McGregor, MN. Minisinaakwaang Community houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District II Community and Government Services Center, serving primarily District IIb. =District III= Aazhoomog District (District III) of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is located primarily in Pine County, comprises the Ne- zhingwaakokaag (Pine City-Rock Creek-Pokegama Lake) community of the historical Snake and Knife Rivers Band of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag (Hinckley) and Asinikaaning (Sandstone) communities of the historical Kettle River Band of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, and the Aazhoomog (Lake Lena) Village of the historical St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, and service area from those locations. Though historically forming the western half of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians, these communities associated with the Mille Lacs band since the 1800s and are a part of today's contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. The contemporary St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, located east of the St. Croix River, is considered a federally recognized tribe, which is not associated with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, located west of the St. Croix River. Aazhoomog Village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Community and Government Service Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the Ne-Ia- Shing Health Clinic system. Operating out of Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag is Grand Casino Hinckley and their various enterprises, including a golf course, RV park and a concert hall. =Urban district= The Urban District of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is a special services district serving the large number of Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe living in the Twin Cities urban area. Originally in the Band's statutes, the urban area was established and defined as being Anoka, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, providing TANF services to Band members in those three counties. While TANF services are still at the core for services provided to Band members living in the urban area, the Urban District has grown in providing other tribal supportive services, before available only on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation proper. With a cooperative agreement with the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Urban District provides affordable rental housing units to eligible low-income Band members. Communities Though only nine communities are cited in the Band's statutes, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe has ten formal communities and additional six informal communities. Ten formal communities: *Vineland, Minnesota (Nay-ah-shing [Neyaashiing]) *Isle, Minnesota (Chi-mini-sing [Chi-minising]) *East Lake, Minnesota (Mi-ni-si-na-kwang [Minisinaakwaang]) *Minnewawa, Minnesota (Manoominikaan-zaaga'iganiing) *Sandy Lake, Minnesota (Ga-me-ta-wa-ga-gi-mog [Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag]) *Sandstone, Minnesota (A-sin-ni-ga-ning [Asinikaaning]) *Lake Lena, Minnesota (Ah-sho-moog [Aazhoomog]) *Hinckley, Minnesota (Ga-shi-gwa-na-bi-go-gog [Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag]) *Pine City, Minnesota (Ne-shi-gwa-go-gog [Ne-zhingwaakokaag]) *The Twin Cities (Gichi- oodenaang) Six informal communities: * Brainerd, Minnesota (Oshki-oodenaang) * Onamia, Minnesota (Gibaakwa'igaansing) * Cove, Minnesota (Wiikwegamaang) * Wahkon, Minnesota (Zaagawaamikaag-wiidwedong) * Moose Lake, Minnesota (Mooz- eskani-zaaga'iganiing) * Duluth, Minnesota (Onigamiinsing) See alsoMinnesota Indian Affairs Council * Aaniin Ekidong: Ojibwe Vocabulary Project.

The Band has 4,302 members as of 2012. Its homeland is the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, consisting of District I (near Onamia), District II (near McGregor), District IIa (near Isle), and District III (near Hinckley). The Mille Lacs Band is one of six members of the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which they organized in 1934. The other members are the White Earth Band, Leech Lake Band, Grand Portage Band, Bois Forte Band, and Fond du Lac Band. \\"Chippewa,\\" is a term commonly used in the United States to refer to Ojibwe people; the Mille Lacs Band prefers the term \\"Ojibwe,\\" which is also more common in Canada. Clans There are eight major doodem (or clan) types found among the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. They are Bizhiw (Lynx), Makwa (Bear), Waabizheshi (Marten) Awaazisii (Bullhead), Ma'iingan (Wolf), Migizi (Bald Eagle), Name (Sturgeon) and Moozens (Little Moose). The historical Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota was part of the historical Mille Lacs Indians. The Snake River Band of Isanti Dakota became part of the historical St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which is today known as the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota. Due to some of these Dakota ancestry, Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe have a high degree of Ma'iingan-doodem members. Mazina'igan: Clans and Mille Lacs Band Clans , Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission, Fall 1999 History According to oral traditions, the Ojibwe, part of the Algonquian languages-speaking peoples, coalesced on the Atlantic coast of North America. About 500 years ago, the ancestors of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe began migrating west. This tradition has been confirmed by linguistic and archeological evidence. By the mid-1700s, the Ojibwe had become established in the region around Mille Lacs Lake in what is today East Central Minnesota. They had a varied diet based on the resources of the area and hunted deer, bear, moose, waterfowl, and small game; fished the area's lakes and streams; gathered wild rice, maple sugar, nuts and berries; and cultivated some plants. Europeans started arriving, among them French, British and American fur traders. Some European colonists stayed and began to compete with the Mille Lacs Band for resources and to encroach on their land. Such settlers continued to violate the treaties and agreements which the Mille Lacs Band made with the United States and British representatives over the decades. The Ojibwe also suffered because of new infectious diseases, which killed many. By the end of the nineteenth century, only a few hundred Ojibwe remained on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. At that time, pressing for assimilation, the United States government prohibited the Ojibwe from practicing their religion (many had converted to Catholicism but still combined it with traditional prayers and rituals), tried to have their children sent to boarding schools at which they were forced to learn and speak English, and virtually denied their right to govern themselves. Their traditional way of life was nearly impossible to follow. Over the next century, Ojibwe bands in the Mille Lacs region struggled with poverty and despair. With the passage of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, the bands of the Mille Lacs region joined five others in forming the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, organized 1934-1936. The four historical bands in the Mille Lacs region (Mille Lacs Indians, Sandy Lake Band, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and Snake and Kettle River Bands of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota) were reorganized as the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. In the early 1990s, the Band opened Grand Casino Mille Lacs and Grand Casino Hinckley. Since then, casino revenues have allowed the Mille Lacs Band to strengthen its cultural identity, return to economic self-sufficiency, rebuild its reservation, and increase the prosperity of the entire region. Tribal government The Mille Lacs Band has a separation-of-powers form of government, making it one of the few Native American governments with three branches of government, similar to the government structure of the United States. =Executive branch= The current Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is Melanie Benjamin. The Chief Executive, who is elected by Band members every four years, is the head of the executive branch.

Their comics follow an anthropomorphic, misanthropic carton of milk and a wedge of cheese. The eponymous \\"dairy products gone bad\\" tend to drink copious quantities of gin and become violent.  Publication history  Cheese began as an in-joke involving two friends of Dorkin who were sometimes called the \\"cheesy\\" Garcia sisters. He continued drawing little cheeses that would eventually become \\"Cheese\\" on cocktail napkins at clubs during the mid to late 1980s. One night, at a restaurant, Dorkin scribbled a little Milk character next to the cheese drawing, with the pair hitch-hiking and holding beers in their hands. Dorkin continued to sketch the two characters at conventions until Kurt Sayenga of the now defunct Greed Magazine saw them at a San Diego comic book convention and offered Dorkin a spot for a Milk & Cheese strip in the magazine. The strip ran in the final issue of Greed, published in 1989. Several more strips were printed in various comic books and magazines before Slave Labor Graphics collected them and published Milk & Cheese #1. Since that time the company has published six more comic books featuring the characters. Several issues of the title were numbered as number one issues, making fun of the practice of buying comic books as an investment instead of as entertainment. In 2011, Dark Horse Comics released a hardcover collection containing nearly every strip featuring the characters from 1989 to 2010.  Ancillary products  Dorkin has turned down several offers to turn Milk & Cheese into an animated series or a movie, feeling that the characters would not translate well to the small or large screen. Merchandise such as magnets, Zippo lighters and lunchboxes have been produced though, and vinyl action figures of the pair have also been produced.

The film concentrates on Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson (Laurence Fishburne), Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garc√≠a). Plot In 1934, Ellsworth ‚ÄúBumpy‚Äù Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is released from Sing Sing and returns to Harlem, where mobster Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) asserts his control of the lucrative numbers game. Schultz begrudgingly reports to Mafia boss Charles ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù Luciano (Andy Garcia), who pays bribes to special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey (William Atherton) to protect his business. Reuniting with his cousin \\"Illinois\\" Gordon (Chi McBride), Bumpy returns to the employ of Harlem crime boss Madame Queen (Cicely Tyson), whose business is threatened by Schultz. Bumpy is introduced to Francine (Vanessa Williams), a friend of Illinois‚Äô girlfriend Mary (Loretta Devine). Schultz‚Äôs meeting with the Queen ends in a standoff when he presents her with a rival‚Äôs testicles. Walking Francine home from a club, Bumpy charms her with his poetry. Madame Queen is attacked by Schultz‚Äôs men, led by black enforcer Bub Hewlett (Clarence Williams III), but Bumpy and fellow mobster Whispers (Paul Benjamin) repel the assassins and rescue her. At a meeting of the Commission, Schultz states his determination to take over Harlem. After robbing Schultz‚Äôs operation with Illinois, Bumpy is chastised by Madame Queen for making his own decisions. Schultz then hires two hitmen, the Salke brothers, to kill Bumpy, and has his police contact, NYPD Captain Foley (Richard Bradford), arrange for Madame Queen to be arrested. At a party, a 17-year-old named Tyrone asks Bumpy for a job, and Francine struggles to reconcile her feelings for Bumpy with his criminal ways. The Salkes break into Bumpy‚Äôs home, killing his guards, but Bumpy ambushes them and kills one while the other is shot dead by a terrified Francine. Illinois is beaten and robbed by Foley and his officers, while Madame Queen is arrested for illegal gambling. Taking over her operation, Bumpy enlists Tyrone as a runner, and ignores the Queen‚Äôs orders to avoid violence. By May 1935, he is locked in an all-out war with Schultz. His wealth and power grow, as does the body count, including Tyrone. Bumpy‚Äôs attempt to comfort Tyrone‚Äôs mother at his funeral is rejected. At an ice cream parlor with Francine, Bumpy realizes his banana split has been poisoned. When the shop owner reveals that Bumpy‚Äôs associate Vallie ordered him to hire the new teenage employee responsible, Bumpy forces the boy to eat the poisoned ice cream despite his attempts to apologize. Whispers then kills Vallie with a razor. Bumpy confronts Schultz at the Cotton Club with Vallie‚Äôs severed finger, demanding he cease his Harlem operations; Schultz refuses. Disguised as truck drivers, Bumpy and Illinois deliver a bomb to one of Schultz‚Äôs illicit breweries, narrowly escaping before the warehouse explodes. Illinois returns home to find Schultz had Mary killed in retaliation. Threatened by Dewey to end the bloodshed in Harlem, Luciano invites Bumpy and Schultz to a meeting, against both their wills. Visiting Madame Queen in prison, Bumpy is rebuked for inciting a gang war. Finding she can no longer accept who he is, Francine leaves him, and Illinois drunkenly confronts him over the innocent lives lost. Illinois is abducted and tortured by Foley, to Hewlett‚Äôs disgust, but refuses to betray his cousin. At Luciano‚Äôs meeting, Bumpy and Schultz refuse to settle their dispute. After finding Illinois‚Äô corpse left as a message, Bumpy slits Foley‚Äôs throat while he's with a black prostitute, but spares Hewlett‚Äôs life and offers him a partnership. Bumpy accepts an alliance with Luciano, and Luciano‚Äôs driver ‚Äì on Bumpy‚Äôs orders ‚Äì informs Schultz that Bumpy will be meeting with Luciano‚Äôs accountant. Schultz and his men burst in but find only the accountant, who Schultz kills. At a restaurant, Schultz‚Äôs long-suffering henchman Lulu (Ed O'Ross) shoots him in the bathroom, and Schultz calmly returns to his table before dying. Meeting Luciano outside for payment, Lulu is shot dead. With Dutch eliminated and the gang war settled, Dewey ‚Äì having received an enormous bribe from Bumpy, delivered by Hewlett ‚Äì warns Luciano to stay away from Harlem. Hewlett and Bumpy part ways, and Bumpy arrives at Illinois‚Äô funeral. After exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen, Bumpy walks out into the rain alone.

The firm had fallen deep into debt through its investment in new ships, intended to help the firm compete with Eimskip and American shipping firms in the transatlantic shipping trade. It was declared bankrupt on December 6, 1985; this led in turn to the collapse of its main lending bank, √ötvegsbanki (the Fisheries Bank of Iceland). Partly because of Hafskip's ties to Iceland's finance minister Albert Gu√∞mundsson, who was its former chairman and still a shareholder at the time of the firm's collapse, Hafskip's bankruptcy became a fuel for rival politicians, and ignited a criminal investigation which lasted six years. Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson, Hafskip's managing director, and the Hafskip executives Pill Bragi Kristj√≥nsson, Ragnar Kjartansson and the company's auditor, Helgi Magn√∫sson, were detained and later charged with 450 criminal counts, from embezzlement to fraud. Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson was found guilty on five counts of minor bookkeeping offenses and sentenced to 12 months' probation.

A leading-edge slot is a spanwise gap in each wing, allowing air to flow from below the wing to its upper surface. In this manner they allow flight at higher angles of attack and thus reduce the stall speed.Kermode, A.C., Mechanics of Flight, Chapter 3 Purpose and development Full-span leading-edge slot in the wing of the PZL-104M Wilga 2000 At an angle of attack above about 15¬∞ many airfoils enter the stall. Modification of such an airfoil with a fixed leading-edge slot can increase the stalling angle to between 22¬∞ and 25¬∞.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 6.9 Slots were first developed by Handley Page in 1919 and the first aircraft to fly with them was the experimental H.P.17, a modified Airco DH.9A. Their invention is credited jointly to Sir Frederick Handley Page and Gustav Lachmann. The first aircraft fitted with controllable slots was the Handley Page H.P.20. Licensing the design became one of Handley Page's major sources of income in the 1920s.Centennial of Flight Retrieved 2008-02-19 Similar, but retractable, leading-edge devices are called slats.Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, From the Ground Up, page 26 (27th revised edition) When the slat opens, it creates a slot between the slat and the remainder of the wing; retracted, the drag is reduced. A fixed leading-edge slot can increase the maximum lift coefficient of an airfoil section by 40%. In conjunction with a slat, the increase in maximum lift coefficient can be 50% or even 60%.Kermode, A.C., Mechanics of Flight, Figure 3.36 Unlike trailing edge flaps, leading- edge slots do not increase the lift coefficient at zero angle of attack since they do not alter the camber.Kermode, A.C., Mechanics of Flight, Figure 3.37 Operation Partial-span leading-edge slot in the wing of a Stinson 108-3 Fieseler Storch with full-span slots A Zenith STOL CH 701 showing its full- span slot. A leading-edge slot is a fixed (non-closing) gap behind the wing's leading edge. Air from below the wing can accelerate through the slot towards the low pressure region above the wing, and exit from the slot moving parallel to the upper wing surface. This high-speed flow then mixes with the boundary layer attached to the upper surface and delays boundary layer separation from the upper surface. Slots naturally exact a penalty on the aircraft in which they are used. This is because they contribute to drag compared to an unslotted wing.Abbott and Von Doenhoff, Theory of Wing Sections, Section 8.6 The extra drag at low speed is acceptable because of the beneficial reduction in stall speed and improvement in handling characteristics, but at higher speeds the extra drag contributed by slots is a significant disadvantage because it reduces cruising speed and increases fuel consumption per unit distance flown. One way to reduce the cruise drag of slots is to make them able to be closed. This arrangement is known as leading-edge slats. Aerodynamically, slats work in the same way as fixed slots but slats can be retracted at higher speeds when they are not needed. Slats, in turn, are heavier and more complex than slots. At low angles of attack the airflow through the slot is insignificant, although it contributes to drag. At progressively higher angles of attack, the flow of air through the slot becomes increasingly significant, accelerating from the higher pressure region below the wing to the lower pressure region on top of the wing. At high angles of attack the fastest airspeed relative to the airfoil is very close to the leading edge, on the upper surface. In this region of high local airspeed, skin friction (viscous force) is very high and the boundary layer arriving at the slot on the upper wing has lost much of its total pressure (or total mechanical energy) due to this friction. In contrast, the air passing through the slot has not experienced this high local airspeed or high skin friction, and its total pressure remains close to the free-stream value. The mixing of the upper surface boundary layer with air arriving through the slot re- energises the boundary layer which then remains attached to the upper surface of the wing to a higher angle of attack than if the slot were not there. The leading-edge slot was therefore one of the earliest forms of boundary layer control. Application of leading-edge slots Leading-edge slots are generally of two types: those that are full-span and those that are partial- span. Full-span slots are generally found on Short Take-off and Landing STOL aircraft like the Fieseler Storch, Dornier Do 27, PZL-104M Wilga 2000, and Zenair CH 701 STOL. Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack before reaching the stalling angle.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 471. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. In aircraft other than specialist STOL aircraft, full-span slots have serious drawbacks because, to take advantage of the high angle of attack at the stall, they usually necessitate long undercarriage legs that either cause high drag or are longer than can be accommodated easily inside the airframe.Kermode, A.C., Mechanics of Flight, Figures 6.6 and 6.7 Partial- span slots are usually found only on the outboard portion of the wing where they ensure airflow over that portion of the wing will remain unstalled at higher angles of attack than the inboard portions of the wing. This ensures the wing root stalls first and contributes to docile stall behaviour and maintaining aileron control throughout the stall. Using slots in this manner produces a similar result to employing washout on a wing, but through a different means. Examples of aircraft with partial-span, fixed slots are the Stinson 108, Bristol Beaufort, Lockheed Hudson, and Dornier Do 28D-2 Skyservant.

Its administrative headquarters is two miles south of Morton. The reservation is located southeast of Redwood Falls, the county seat. The area was established as part of a reservation for the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands of the Lower Sioux under the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 with the federal government. It originally extended about along the Minnesota River and was wide. It was greatly reduced following the Dakota War of 1862 and various other actions. As of the 2000 census, this lower reservation had a population of 335, and a land area of 2.705 sq mi (7.006 km¬≤). History The area around the reservation is primarily rural, developed in the 21st century for agricultural commodity crops of corn and soybeans. The conversion of area creeks to agricultural ditches has also altered habitat and reduced the diversity of the ecology. =Termination efforts= From the 1940s to the 1960s, the United States government (including Congress) had a policy of terminating tribes, that is, ending the special relationships that they had with the federal government. The belief was that tribes would be selected that appeared to have adapted successfully to mainstream culture: in the process, any communal land would be distributed to individual households, and individuals would become residents of their respective counties and states, and under their jurisdiction. Four Native American tribes (each associated with separate reservations) in Minnesota were identified for termination in the 1950s. A memo dated January 19, 1955 for the BIA issued from the Department of the Interior indicates additional terminations were being reviewed in proposed legislation for what were primarily Dakota tribes in southern Minnesota, including the Lower Sioux Community in Redwood and Scott counties, the New Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County, the Prairie Island Community in Goodhue County, and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County. Discussions between the BIA and the tribal Indians from the targeted area began in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Though the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements for distribution of land to individual households and ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed fee- simple title to tribal lands. On January 26, 1955 Senator Edward Thye introduced a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the tribes. In addition to opposition by the Dakota, regional residents objected to termination, saying that county and state expenditures might increase for the areas then within reservations, and they expressed their opposition to the committee reviewing the bill. The Minnesota Governor's Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would \\"not adequately protect the interests of the Indians...\\". The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.> Tribal enterprises The Mdewakanton tribe operates Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel, which began in 1984 as a bingo facility. The casino has become a major employer for the surrounding communities. The Lower Sioux Agency, a historic site on the reservation associated with the Dakota War of 1862, is managed by the community in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society. Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel was the state of Minnesota's first casino. In addition to the gaming areas, Jackpot Junction features three bars, three restaurants, an amphitheater for live performances, and two grand ballrooms. Live music is played every weekend, usually country and occasionally rock. The casino is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. County Highway 2 runs through the reservation, connecting it to U.S. Route 71 and Minnesota State Highway 19 to the northwest.

She was also a member of Robert Fripp's short-lived band The League of Gentlemen and is also notable for work with B-52s, Ani DiFranco and Indigo Girls.  Biography  Lee confirmed in an interview on Rundgrenradio.com that Sara Lee is her birth name. Born in the West Midlands of England, Lee's entire family was musical. Both parents were music teachers (her father was latterly a bass song man in the choir of York Minster), her sister a cellist, and her brother a trombone player. Music formed an important part of her childhood. She played tympani and double bass in school and local orchestras as a teenager, until the day she discovered the electric bass guitar. After playing with a couple of local bands, she moved to London and worked as a secretary at Polydor Records. Here she was discovered by King Crimson leader Robert Fripp, who was encouraged to stay at a show to see \\"a girl who works in the office. \\" Fripp invited her to join his band, The League of Gentlemen. Lee went on to work with Robyn Hitchcock on his album Groovy Decay and recorded two albums with famed political, post punk band Gang of Four in England. Later she moved to the United States. Lee became a sought- after session, concert and recording artist, playing with the Thompson Twins before she crossed paths with The B-52's during the recording of their Cosmic Thing album, and can be seen in the \\"Love Shack\\" and the \\"Roam\\" videos. Following a stint on the Cosmic tour, Sara formed The Raging Hormones with B-52 session drummer Charley Drayton. She then started a seven-year run with the Indigo Girls, contributing \\"sterling performances\\". In 1996 and 1997 she accompanied singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco on tours of Europe and North America, as documented on the double-live album Living in Clip. Lee has played with many other artists, including Joan Osborne, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Fiona Apple, and is a close friend of former David Bowie bassist Gail Ann Dorsey. Lee re-joined the B-52's as a touring member in 1999. On 12 September 2000 she released her debut solo album Make It Beautiful on Difranco's Righteous Babe records. Lee recorded instrumental tracks, which were sent to musicians with whom she had previously worked to provide lyrics, including Ani DiFranco, Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls, Pal Shazar, Barbara Gogan of The Passions and Kristen Hall. She replaced Rachel Haden for the final dates of Todd Rundgren's 2009 Arena tour. Lee was also a judge for the fifth annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

It was founded in 1944 in Moscow by an outstanding native biologist academician Vladimir Nikolayevich Sukachev. The institute was named after him in 1967. In 1959 the Institute was assigned to the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and transferred to Krasnoyarsk. History In various years the Institute was headed by academicians V.N.Sukachev (1944-1959), A.B.Zhukov (1959-1977), and A.S.Isayev (1977-1988). Since 1994 the Institute has been headed by academician Y.A.Vaganov. The Institute of Forest is the largest forest-biologic institution in the Russian Academy of Sciences. Its staff consists of 170 scientific researchers, 1 academician, 33 doctors and 95 candidates of sciences including. Among them there are 3 Honoured Scientists of the Russian Federation and 4 Honoured Foresters of the Russian Federation. More than 60 people take a Ph.D. course simultaneously in a number of forest specialties: forest science, forestry, forest management, forest taxation, sylvicultures, forest pyrology, genetics and selection, ecology, botany, forest soil science, entomology, microbiology, physiology and biochemistry of wood plants, and bioinformatics. From 1947 to 2003 at the Institute 140 prominent native foresters have defended their doctor‚Äôs theses. A part of them were then elected members of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1947 the Institute has been a collective member of the International Union of Forest Research Institutions, and since 1991 it has entered the International Association of Boreal Forest Researchers. The library of the Institute is a depository of scientific literature on the forest themes for the regions of Siberia and Far East. It makes up more than 150 units of storage. The readers of the library (550 people) are not only employees of the Institute but also lecturers, Ph.D. students, and university students. Academics The structure of the Institute (4 departments, 10 laboratories and a branch in Novosibirsk) provides development of fundamental and applied research in a wide range: biospherical role, ecologic functions and biodiversity of forest ecosystems, monitoring of their condition, and rational use of forest resources. The scientific schools formed at the Institute: taiga forestry and productivity of forests, permafrost forestry, taxation and forest exploitation, forest morphology, cartography, aerospace information usage, forest genetics and selection, pyrology, zoology, microbiology, physiology and biochemistry of wood plants, dendrology and dendroclimatology and other spheres of forest biological science are the basis for mutual investigations with the scientists of the United States, Canada, England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belarus, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Japan, China, Korea, Mongolia. In 1992 there has been founded Siberian international center of ecological investigations of boreal forests which favours the participation of employees in foreign grants, projects, programs including the problems of climate changes, atmosphere gas composition and biodiversity. In different landscape- ecological conditions on the territory of Siberia a net of basic research points (stationaries) to carry out experimental work and durable monitoring of forest ecosystems function was created. Availability of experts of various profiles at the Institute makes it possible to estimate scientific and applied forest problems. So, in the 1960s a complex research of mountain Siberian pine forests of Siberia was finished by development of ‚ÄúInstructions‚Äù on forest management in them. In it for the first time the primary significance of forestforming functions of this forest formation and their hydrology role in particular was stressed. In the activities of the Institute a great place is taken by investigations in the forests of Lake Baikal started on the initiative of academician A.B.Zhukov yet in the early 1970s. The developed approaches regulate exploitation of the region forests. They scientifically ground the monitoring of forest exploitation. It is proved by the regional evaluation scale of reforestation evaluation, by the landscape approach to location of wood-cutting areas and by rating of the technogenic load on the ground. This provides the level of ecological security corresponding to the legislation of the Russian Federation on Lake Baikal protection and UNESCO requirements to the objects of world heritage. For a number of years the Institute has been developing application methods of information coming from flying vehicles (planes, satellites) to estimate condition of forest cover of taiga zone under the impact of anthropogenic and natural factors. Under the leadership of academician A.S. Isayev in 1970-1980 there was worked out a system of aerospace information analysis. It includes etalon polygons on which on-ground and remote information was compared. Forest territories were differentiation on natural basis, experimental research of interaction of electromagnetic radiations with typical forest vegetation was made. Real expression of these investigations became a thematic cartography of resourcefully perspective single regions, compilation of forest fund maps. Recently Continuation of this work nowadays is the development of the technique of woodstand taxation and morphology structure investigation on the basis of laser, digital photo and video survey, digital satellite survey and three-dimensional taxational computer analysis of images. On its basis regularities of taxational structure and dynamics of phytomass in plantations forming after fires and cuttings were found out. Two receiving and analyzing satellite information stations available at the Institute make it possible to estimate ecological information in real time in the interests of various institutions. In cooperation with foreign scientists the Institutes is working out the system approach to forest management with the help of GIS technologies and databases characterizing the main components of forest biocenoses. On the basis of modern techniques of receiving and analysis of scientific information estimation of ecological condition of forests in the zones of huge technogenic impact (oil-gas complex of West Siberia, Norilsk industrial region) is carried out. In two dendrariums of the Institute for more than 30 years about 450 species, subspecies and forms of trees and bushes from different botanico- geographical regions have been investigated. Their acclimatization, growth and development in new conditions are estimated to select perspective species for planting of greenery in towns and other settlements. Long-term investigations of Siberian forests are reflected in more than 450 books and collections of papers of the Institute employees. The information about features of forest forming process contained in them is widely used by home and foreign scientists and design organizations. On its basis normative documents (rules, directions, recommendations) regulating the main forest production works in Siberia.

The seed capsules of these Central and South American lady's slipper orchids were formerly used as vanilla substitutes, but selenipediums are now rarely cultivated. Partly this is because of the difficulty of doing so, but is probably also due to the relatively small size of the Selenipedium's flower.

The founding members included Tim Shea on guitar and vocals, Rob Hamilton on drums, Can Keskin on guitar and bass, Steve Rzucidlo on bass, and Chris Pearson on guitar and vocals. Later the line-up would change to feature Jeff Iwanicki on bass and Greg Gilmartin on drums. Overview and biography The band defied easy categorization, but the three-guitar cacophony of its music was often referred to in the subgenres of noise rock, post punk, no wave, and even industrial music. After releasing a string of indie singles, the band briefly signed with Sub Pop records in 1992 and released their debut CD Blood Music, named after a science fiction novel of the same title by author Greg Bear. The album was critically acclaimed, and the bleak, dystopian nature of both the lyrics and music were compared by UK music journalists to such groups as Killing Joke, Live Skull, Gang of Four, and early Sonic Youth. After playing and touring extensively with both Boston-based and national acts such as The Lemonheads, Come, Galaxie 500, Dinosaur Jr., The Afghan Whigs, The Flaming Lips and The Jesus Lizard, as well as playing the second stage at Lollapalooza in 1992, the group released a CD EP titled Revisionist in 1993, and what would be their final CD, Illuminatus, in 1995. After several line-up changes, GMS finally disbanded in 1997. Now regarded as a highly underrated, influential band ahead of its time, Green Magnet School is considered one of the seminal indie rock groups that sprouted from the fertile, post-grunge Boston music community of the late 1980s to early 1990s. The band reunited for one night on October 7, 2004 to play a sold-out benefit/memorial show at The Middle East nightclub in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The LSND project was created to look for evidence of neutrino oscillation, and its results conflict with the standard model expectation of only three neutrino flavors, when considered in the context of other solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments. Cosmological data bound the mass of the sterile neutrino to ms < 0.26eV (0.44eV) at 95% (99.9%) confidence limit, excluding at high significance the sterile neutrino hypothesis as an explanation of the LSND anomaly. The controversial LSND result was tested by the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab, which refuted a simple 2-neutrino oscillation interpretation of the LSND result. The detector consisted of a tank filled with 167 tons (50,000 gallons) of mineral oil and of b-PDB (2-(4-tert- butylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole) organic scintillator material. Cherenkov light emitted by particle interactions was detected by an array of 1220 photomultiplier tubes. The experiment collected data from 1993 to 1998.

On 15 August 1941, Panzer Group Africa was activated with newly promoted Erwin Rommel in command. The Panzer Group controlled the and other units that were sent to Africa (notably the 90th Light Infantry Division), and the Italian X Corps and XX Corps.

It connects several major cities and is vital for the movement of people and goods between the populous Highlands region and the coast. For most of its length the Highlands Highway is no more than a single carriageway two-lane road which is often hindered by potholes and land slips. It is also notorious, particularly in the Highlands region, for being the place of numerous armed hold-ups and robberies committed by local bandits called raskols. Description The highway begins in Lae and travels through the Markham Valley and the province of Morobe. From the Markham Valley the Highlands Highway turns left and climbs up and over the approximately 1,500 metre high Kassam Pass and into the Eastern Highlands Province. It passes over the wall of Yonki Dam and then travels through the towns of Kainantu and Henganofi to the provincial capital, Goroka. From here it travels up and then over the high Daulo Pass and crosses into Simbu Province, hence, so many gazetted roads within Chuave District link the main Okuk High Way. Teine Agiyonga Memorial Roads like; Warabago-Wiridani Road, Giriyu-Kanma Road and Giriyu-Korima Road is few amongst many and through to its capital of Kundiawa. At the Markham Valley turn-off the road continues as the Ramu Highway through the Ramu Valley into Madang Province and ends at the coast at the provincial capital of Madang. After Kundiawa the highway reaches the Wahgi valley, which marks the start of the Western Highlands Province. It continues through to the provincial capital of Mount Hagen and then at a village called Togoba, it splits. A southern branch continues on to the Southern Highlands province and its capital of Mendi before going on to Tari. The other branch goes to Enga province and its capital of Wabag before ending at the mining town of Porgera. Maintenance issues In 2006 the eastern section of the highway (Lae-Goroka) was resurfaced by the Australian government AusAid Program. Several Japanese and Taiwanese projects have contributed to rebuilding or replacement of important bridges. The Porgera Gold Mine (PJV) is a major user of the Highlands Highway for transport of all its consumables and equipment from Lae port, and consequently spends an enormous amount of time and money on maintaining the road ‚Äì most often the portion from Mt Hagen to Porgera ‚Äì upgrading cuttings, bridges and culverts. The highway is subject to frequent landslides and washouts. In April 2008, the section of the highway passing through Simbu Province was impassable at three separate points over different periods. The most serious of these destroyed a 150-metre section of the highway at Gera village, 10 km east of Kundiawa, on 11 April; this cut off the upper Highlands provinces from all road transport.
