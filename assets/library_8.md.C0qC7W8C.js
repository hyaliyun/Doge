He is University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author, co-author, or editor of seven books in his field. McHugh is a vocal proponent of Catholic- informed and socially conservative stances relating to sexual orientation and transgender people. Some scientists accuse McHugh of misrepresenting scientific research relating to sexual orientation.  Education  Paul McHugh was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the son of a Lowell High School teacher and a homemaker.McHugh, Paul R. (2006). The mind has mountains: Reflections on society and psychiatry. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, copyright page. He graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, in 1948,from Harvard College in 1952 and from Harvard Medical School in 1956. While at Harvard he was \\"introduced to and ultimately directed away from the Freudian school of psychiatry\\".McHugh, P. R. (2008). Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash over Meaning, Memory, and Mind. New York, DANA, p. 26Jim Duffy, Straight-shooting Shrink , Hopkins Medical News, Winter, 1999. After medical school, McHugh's education was influenced by George Thorn, the physician-in-chief at the Harvard-affiliated Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women's Hospital). Thorn was disillusioned with Freudian psychiatry and felt that those who devoted themselves to it became single- minded, failing to improve as doctors. Thorn encouraged McHugh to develop a different career path, suggesting that he enter the field of psychiatry by first studying neurology. At Thorn's recommendation, McHugh was accepted into the neurology and neuropathology residency program at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he studied for three years under Dr. Raymond Adams, chief of the neurology department.McHugh, P. R. (2008). Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash over Meaning, Memory, and Mind. New York, DANA, p. 26-29 McHugh then went to the Institute of Psychiatry in London, where he studied under Sir Aubrey Lewis and was supervised by James Gibbons and Gerald Russell. McHugh next went to the Division of Neuropsychiatry at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.McHugh, P. R. (2008). Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash over Meaning, Memory, and Mind. New York, DANA, p. 31 McHugh is a practicing Catholic. According to a 2002 New York Times article, he is a Democrat \\"who describes himself as religiously orthodox, politically liberal and culturally conservative ‚Äî a believer in marriage and the Marines, a supporter of institutions and family values\\".  Career  After his training, McHugh held various academic and administrative positions, including Professor of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College (where he founded the Bourne Behavioral Research Laboratory), Clinical Director and Director of Residency Education at the New York Presbyterian Hospital Westchester Division. After reportedly being passed over for the Cornell chair in favor of Robert Michaels, he left New York to become Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oregon. During the 1960s, McHugh co-authored papers on hydrocephalus, depression and suicide, and amygdaloid stimulation. From 1975 till 2001, McHugh served as the Henry Phipps Professor of Psychiatry and the director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at the Johns Hopkins University. At the same time, he was psychiatrist-in-chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is currently University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.McHugh, P. R. (2008). Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash over Meaning, Memory, and Mind. New York, DANA Press. His research has focused on the neuroscientific foundations of motivated behaviors, psychiatric genetics, epidemiology, and neuropsychiatry. In 1975, McHugh co-authored (along with M. F. Folstein and S. E. Folstein) a paper entitled \\"Mini-Mental State: A Practical Method for Grading the Cognitive State of Patients for the Clinician\\". This paper details the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), an exam consisting of 11 questions, that assesses patients for signs of dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment. In 1979, in his capacity as chair of the Department of Psychiatry, McHugh ended gender reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.Richard P. Fitzgibbons, M.D., Philip M. Sutton, and Dale O‚ÄôLeary, The Psychopathology of ‚ÄúSex Reassignment‚Äù Surgery, Assessing Its Medical, Psychological, and Ethical Appropriateness, The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly, Spring 2009, p. 100. In 2017 the clinic was reopened.\\" In 1983, McHugh and colleague Phillip R. Slavney co-authored The Perspectives of Psychiatry, which presented the Johns Hopkins approach to psychiatry. The book \\"seeks to systematically apply the best work of behaviorists, psychotherapists, social scientists and other specialists long viewed as at odds with each other\\". A second edition was published in 1998. He was a founder in 1992 and board member in the 1990s of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, which raised skepticism about adults who claimed to have recovered long-buried memories of childhood sexual abuse or incest. Throughout the 1990s, McHugh was active in debunking the idea of recovered memory ‚Äî that is, the idea that people could suddenly and spontaneously remember childhood sexual abuse. In 1992, McHugh announced that he was going to leave Johns Hopkins and accept a position as director and CEO of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine sought to retain him and was successful in doing so. That year, McHugh was elected to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) - National Academies of Science - now the National Academy of Medicine. McHugh treated author Tom Wolfe for depression suffered following coronary bypass surgery. Wolfe dedicated his 1998 novel, A Man in Full to McHugh, ‚Äúwhose brilliance, comradeship and unfailing kindness saved the day.‚ÄùWolfe, Tom. (1998). A Man in Full. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. In 2001, McHugh was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Presidential Council on Bioethics. The Council was charged with the task of making recommendations as to what the U.S. federal government's policy regarding embryonic stem cells should be. McHugh was against using new lines of embryonic stem cells derived from in vitro fertilization but was in favor of the use of stem cells derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT, the nucleus of a cell is removed and replaced by another cell nucleus. McHugh felt that cells created in this fashion could be regarded as merely tissue, whereas stem cells taken from embryos caused the killing of an unborn child.\\"Zygote and 'Clonote': The ethical use of embryonic stem cells. in The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 237-241. In 2002, McHugh was appointed to a lay panel assembled by the Roman Catholic Church to look into sexual abuse by Catholic priests in the United States.\\"Psychiatrist on Catholic Panel Criticized,\\" The Washington Post. This appointment was controversial, as McHugh had previously served as expert witness in the defense of numerous priests accused of child sexual abuse. David Clohessy, Director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, was appalled at McHugh's inclusion.\\"Bishops appoint sexual abuse review panel,\\" Tampa Bay Times. McHugh said the furor surprised him. In 2012, McHugh and Slavney published an essay in The New England Journal of Medicine criticizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which was soon to be published in its fifth edition. One of their main criticisms is that the DSM, since its third edition, uses a top-down checklist approach to diagnosis rather than a thorough bottom-up approach. McHugh compared the DSM to a field guide used by amateur birders to identify birds. McHugh was featured in a 2017 Netflix documentary, The Keepers, for his role in the defense in the 1995 trial, Jane Doe et al. v. A. Joseph Maskell et al., which was a case involving the sexual abuse of two women at the hands of a Catholic priest, Father Joseph Maskell. Gender, sexuality and sex reassignment surgery McHugh opposes sex reassignment surgery for transgender people. In 1979, he shut down the gender identity clinic at Johns Hopkins, saying that another researcher found that most of the people he tracked down who had undergone this type of surgery \\"were contented with what they had done and that only a few regretted it. But in every other respect, they were little changed in their psychological condition. They had much the same problems with relationships, work, and emotions as before. The hope that they would emerge now from their emotional difficulties to flourish psychologically had not been fulfilled\\". He has said that medical treatment for transgender youth is ‚Äúlike performing liposuction on an anorexic child‚Äù, described post-operative transgender women as ‚Äúcaricatures of women‚Äù because the surgery failed to change many of their male traits, and stated that ‚ÄúThe transgendered suffer a disorder of 'assumption.'‚Äù In his book The Man Who Would Be Queen, psychologist J. Michael Bailey writes that McHugh's concerns are \\"worth taking seriously\\", but criticizes McHugh's conclusions, saying \\"we simply have no idea how to make gender dysphoria go away. I suspect that both autogynephilic and homosexual gender dysphoria result from early and irreversible developmental processes in the brain. If so, learning more about the origins of transsexualism will not get us much closer to curing it.\\" McHugh considers homosexuality to be an ‚Äúerroneous desire‚Äù and supported 2008 California Proposition 8.Kristin Perry v. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dennis Hollingsworth United States Court of Appeals For The Ninth Circuit  The New Atlantis controversy and criticism  In August 2016, McHugh, at the time retired, co-authored a 143-page article on gender and sexuality in The New Atlantis, a non-peer reviewed journal published under the auspices of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Christian-focused conservative think tank.McHugh Paul R., Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences In September 2016 Johns Hopkins University faculty members Chris Beyrer, Robert W. Blum, and Tonia C. Poteat wrote a Baltimore Sun op-ed, to which six other Johns Hopkins faculty members also contributed, in which they indicated concerns about McHugh's co- authored report, which they said mischaracterized the current state of science on gender and sexuality.\\"Bishops appoint sexual abuse review panel,\\" The Baltimore Sun. They wrote that it ‚Äúmischaracterizes the current state of the science on sexuality and gender.‚Äù More than 600 students, faculty members, interns, alumni and others at the medical school also signed a petition calling on the university and hospital to disavow the paper. ‚ÄúThese are dated, now-discredited theories,‚Äù said Chris Beyrer, a professor at the public health school and part of the faculty group that denounced McHugh‚Äôs stance. Geneticist Dean Hamer condemned McHugh‚Äôs publication as a misrepresentation of scientific evidence and his own genetics research. Hamer criticized McHugh use of outdated and ‚Äúcherry picked‚Äù studies, and describes McHugh‚Äôs call for ‚Äúmore research‚Äù as ‚Äúdubious‚Äù since McHugh has a ‚Äúlong history of blocking such efforts‚Äù, including closing the gender identity clinic at Johns Hopkins. Hamer concludes that ‚Äúwhen the data we have struggled so long and hard to collect is twisted and misinterpreted by people who call themselves scientists, and who receive the benefits and protection of a mainstream institution such as John Hopkins Medical School, it disgusts me.‚Äù Books = Author = * McHugh, P.

A covering map f is a surjection and a local isomorphism: the neighbourhood of a vertex v in C is mapped bijectively onto the neighbourhood of f(v) in G. The term lift is often used as a synonym for a covering graph of a connected graph. Though it may be misleading, there is no (obvious) relationship between covering graph and vertex cover or edge cover. The combinatorial formulation of covering graphs is immediately generalized to the case of multigraphs. If we identify a multigraph with a 1-dimensional cell complex, a covering graph is nothing but a special example of covering spaces of topological spaces, so that the terminology in the theory of covering spaces is available; say covering transformation group, universal covering, abelian covering, and maximal abelian covering. Definition Let G = (V1, E1) and C = (V2, E2) be two graphs, and let f: V2 ‚Üí V1 be a surjection. Then f is a covering map from C to G if for each v ‚àà V2, the restriction of f to the neighbourhood of v is a bijection onto the neighbourhood of f(v) in G. Put otherwise, f maps edges incident to v one-to-one onto edges incident to f(v). If there exists a covering map from C to G, then C is a covering graph, or a lift, of G. An h-lift is a lift such that the covering map f has the property that for every vertex v of G, its fiber f‚àí1(v) has exactly h elements. Examples In the following figure, the graph C is a covering graph of the graph H. :File:Covering-graph-4.svg The covering map f from C to H is indicated with the colours. For example, both blue vertices of C are mapped to the blue vertex of H. The map f is a surjection: each vertex of H has a preimage in C. Furthermore, f maps bijectively each neighbourhood of a vertex v in C onto the neighbourhood of the vertex f(v) in H. For example, let v be one of the purple vertices in C; it has two neighbours in C, a green vertex u and a blue vertex t. Similarly, let v‚Ä≤ be the purple vertex in H; it has two neighbours in H, the green vertex u‚Ä≤ and the blue vertex t‚Ä≤. The mapping f restricted to {t, u, v} is a bijection onto {t‚Ä≤, u‚Ä≤, v‚Ä≤}. This is illustrated in the following figure: :File:Covering-graph-4-a.svg Similarly, we can check that the neighbourhood of a blue vertex in C is mapped one-to-one onto the neighbourhood of the blue vertex in H: :File:Covering-graph-4-b.svg Double cover In the above example, each vertex of H has exactly 2 preimages in C. Hence H is a 2-fold cover or a double cover of C. For any graph G, it is possible to construct the bipartite double cover of G, which is a bipartite graph and a double cover of G. The bipartite double cover of G is the tensor product of graphs G √ó K2: :File:Covering-graph-2.svg If G is already bipartite, its bipartite double cover consists of two disjoint copies of G. A graph may have many different double covers other than the bipartite double cover. Universal cover For any connected graph G, it is possible to construct its universal covering graph.Angluin 1980. This is an instance of the more general universal cover concept from topology; the topological requirement that a universal cover be simply connected translates in graph- theoretic terms to a requirement that it be acyclic and connected; that is, a tree. The universal covering graph is unique (up to isomorphism). If G is a tree, then G itself is the universal covering graph of G. For any other finite connected graph G, the universal covering graph of G is a countably infinite (but locally finite) tree. The universal covering graph T of a connected graph G can be constructed as follows. Choose an arbitrary vertex r of G as a starting point. Each vertex of T is a non-backtracking walk that begins from r, that is, a sequence w = (r, v1, v2, ..., vn) of vertices of G such that * vi and vi+1 are adjacent in G for all i, i.e., w is a walk * vi-1 ‚â† vi+1 for all i, i.e., w is non-backtracking. Then, two vertices of T are adjacent if one is a simple extension of another: the vertex (r, v1, v2, ..., vn) is adjacent to the vertex (r, v1, v2, ..., vn-1). Up to isomorphism, the same tree T is constructed regardless of the choice of the starting point r. The covering map f maps the vertex (r) in T to the vertex r in G, and a vertex (r, v1, v2, ..., vn) in T to the vertex vn in G. =Examples of universal covers= The following figure illustrates the universal covering graph T of a graph H; the colours indicate the covering map. :File:Covering-graph-5.svg For any k, all k-regular graphs have the same universal cover: the infinite k-regular tree. Topological crystal An infinite-fold abelian covering graph of a finite (multi)graph is called a topological crystal, an abstraction of crystal structures. For example, the diamond crystal as a graph is the maximal abelian covering graph of the four-edge dipole graph. This view combined with the idea of \\"standard realizations\\" turns out to be useful in a systematic design of (hypothetical) crystals. Planar cover A planar cover of a graph is a finite covering graph that is itself a planar graph. The property of having a planar cover may be characterized by forbidden minors, but the exact characterization of this form remains unknown. Every graph with an embedding in the projective plane has a planar cover coming from the orientable double cover of the projective plane; in 1988, Seiya Nagami conjectured that these are the only graphs with planar covers, but this remains unproven.. Voltage graphs A common way to form covering graphs uses voltage graphs, in which the darts of the given graph G (that is, pairs of directed edges corresponding to the undirected edges of G) are labeled with inverse pairs of elements from some group. The derived graph of the voltage graph has as its vertices the pairs (v,x) where v is a vertex of G and x is a group element; a dart from v to w labeled with the group element y in G corresponds to an edge from (v,x) to (w,xy) in the derived graph. The universal cover can be seen in this way as a derived graph of a voltage graph in which the edges of a spanning tree of the graph are labeled by the identity element of the group, and each remaining pair of darts is labeled by a distinct generating element of a free group. The bipartite double can be seen in this way as a derived graph of a voltage graph in which each dart is labeled by the nonzero element of the group of order two.

Snyder led international seminars and workshops for writers in various disciplines, as well as consultation sessions for some of Hollywood's largest studios. Snyder died unexpectedly August 4, 2009, of what was characterized as either a pulmonary embolism or cardiac arrest. A public memorial was held at the Writers Guild of America, West on September 29, 2009.  Early life  Snyder's father, Kenneth C. T. Snyder, was an Emmy-winning TV producer of many children's shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them were The Funny Company, Hot Wheels, animated segments on Sesame Street, Big Blue Marble and the cult classic Roger Ramjet. At the age of eight, Snyder was hired by his father as a voice talent for an animated special starring Sterling Holloway. Snyder continued doing children's voices alongside Gary Owens, June Foray and others until his voice changed and he was fired by his producer father. Snyder went on to earn a B.A. degree in English from Georgetown University, and returned to Los Angeles where he began his career writing for the Disney TV series Kids Incorporated. Snyder began writing full-time as a screenwriter in 1987. He was a member of the Writers Guild of America for over 20 years. Snyder's first spec screenplay sale was in 1989 for the script Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, which sold for $500,000 in a bidding war.Variety, page 6, Nov. 1989 \\"First Time Writers Fare Well at W & A\\" ‚Äì Stop!

Save the Cat!  Snyder's nonfiction book Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on Amazon and in 2018 is on its 34th printing. The book describes in detail the structure of the monomyth or hero's journey, providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting. = Origin of the title = The title Save the Cat! was coined by Snyder to describe a decisive moment when the protagonist demonstrates that they are worth rooting for. Snyder writes that, \\"It's the scene where we [first] meet the hero\\", in order to gain audience favor and support for the main character right from the start. In the opening scene of the movie, Frequency, for example, Frank Sullivan, played by Dennis Quaid, is the veteran firefighter who jumps into a manhole to save two workers from a gas explosion. Prior to his death-defying rescue, his chief warns, \\"Frank, you're not going to make it. There's not enough time.\\" Frank, a true hero, does not seem overly alarmed. This is what he does. His concern is primarily for the men below as he confidently jokes, \\"What, miss the World Series? Not a chance.\\" From this moment on, the audience is fully invested in Frank's well-being and rooting for him to succeed. According to Snyder, this crucial element is missing from many of today's movies. He referenced Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ‚Äì The Cradle of Life (2003) as being a film that focused on making the character Lara Croft \\"cool\\" and sexy (via a \\"new latex body suit for Angelina Jolie\\") instead of likable. An estimated $95 million was spent on this film, and it only grossed $156.5 worldwide ($65.6 million in the U.S.).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325703/business This sequel did not lose money, but it earned considerably less than the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), which grossed $274.7 million worldwide ($131.1 million in the U.S.).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146316/business In his book, Snyder gave greatest emphasis on the importance of structure through his Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or the \\"BS2\\" which includes the 15 essential \\"beats\\" or plot points that all stories should contain. Snyder's method expanded the 15 beats further into 40 beats, which are laid out on \\"The Board.\\" The Board is divided into 4 rows, with each row representing a quarter of the story, namely the 1st Act, the 1st half of the 2nd Act, the 2nd half of the 2nd Act, and the 3rd Act. Snyder also introduced 10 genres in his book that distinguished how stories are structured. According to Snyder, standard genre types such as Romantic Comedy, Epic or Biography did not say much about the story, only the type of movie it is. Snyder's system explored genre more fully, with categories such as \\"Monster in the House\\", \\"Golden Fleece\\", \\"Buddy Love\\" and others. =Book series= In 2007, Snyder wrote Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies. The second book took 50 landmark movies, identified their specific genres, and broke them down into the 15 beats of the BS2. The third book of Snyder's series, Save the Cat! Strikes Back: More Trouble for Screenwriters to Get Into... and Out Of, was published in November, 2009. This was the last book in the series to be authored by Snyder himself. The fourth book was a compilation of Blake's blogs and other writings on the subject of screenwriting, titled Save the Cat! Blake's Blogs: More Information and Inspiration for Writers, (published in 2016). The fifth book was written by his student, Spanish screenwriter and novelist Salva Rubio. It is titled Save the Cat! Goes to the Indies, was published in April 2017, and features the analysis of 50 independent, European, auteur and cult films. The sixth is the first non-screenwriting book, Save the Cat! Writes a Novel: The Last Book on Novel Writing That You'll Ever Need, written by student and YA novelist Jessica Brody (published on October 9, 2018). =Software= As a companion to his books, Snyder developed a story structure software product called Save the Cat! The Last Story Structure Software You'll Ever Need.https://store.savethecat.com/products/save-the-cat-story-structure- software The software places Snyder's Beat Sheet and Board on an end user's desktop, phone, or tablet. In 2008, Snyder and the software company Final Draft, Inc. specializing in script formatting, became partners in building import/export functions between the two programs.Final Draft Press Release March 24, 2008 Final Draft Introduces Two New Development Software Partners. Snyder's company, Blake Snyder Enterprises, LLC, released an iPhone app of the software in November, 2009 and an Android app in 2016. Version 4 of the software and apps, which includes new templates for novelists and television writers, will be released in the fourth quarter of 2018. = Workshops and consultations = Snyder developed two weekend workshops for writers, filmmakers and executives. The introductory class, The Beat Sheet Workshop, helped participants come up with the solid structure of the 15 beats, before they embark on the actual writing of the script. In addition, The Beat Sheet Workshop was expanded to be led internationally. The second workshop, a continuation of the first, called The Board Workshop, had participants take their 15 beats and expand them into 40 cards for a more detailed story structure. Snyder held his workshops all over the United States, Europe and Asia. The workshops were run year round. Snyder also taught his method in such universities as UCLA, Chapman University, Vanderbilt University and the Beijing Film Academy. The in-person Beat Sheet Workshops continue, taught by \\"Master Cats\\" who were mentored by Snyder. The Beat Sheet Workshops expanded with online courses in 2017. Following the release of his first book, Snyder provided script analysis to studios such as Disney, DreamWorks, Laika and Nelvana.http://www.savethecat.com/ Dedications How to Train Your Dragon (DreamWorks, 2010) was dedicated to Snyder.http://www.blakesnyder.com/2010/03/26/how-the-dragon-really-got- trained/ Whispers Under Ground (Gollancz, 2012) by Ben Aaronovitch was dedicated to him as well.

It was a good 15 kilometres long and ran from Ha√üfurt to Hofheim. In the local dialect the line was also known as the Hofheimerle. The railway was closed in 1995. The dismantling of the line was completed in 1997.  History  On 1 August 1852 the railway arrived at Ha√üfurt with the establishment of Ludwig's Western Railway. But not until 40 years later, on 15 March 1892, was the 15.5 kilometre long Sekund√§rbahn ('secondary line') to Hofheim opened by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The basis for the route was a state treaty between the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who guaranteed funding from the Saxon enclave of K√∂nigsberg as well as agreeing the route through its territory. As a result, the line was not built directly from Ha√üfurt to Hofheim along the river Nassach, but a more costly route, involving a diversion via K√∂nigsberg, was chosen. In 1965 the halt of Ha√üfurt-Gymnasium was built for the new grammar school there and for many years it provided a large number of passengers. On 24 September 1994 goods traffic ceased and on 31 July 1995 passenger services were also withdrawn. On 1 December 1995 the line was finally closed; it was dismantled by January 1997. The former station building at Hofheim now houses a small museum about the history of the railway.  Traffic  To begin with two pairs of passenger trains worked the line daily. DRG Class 98.10 and, later, DRG Class 98.11 steam locomotives were used, amongst others. From December 1959 the Uerdingen railbuses were in regular passenger service. In 1976 there were eight pairs of trains on workdays, which had a journey time of about 24 minutes. For goods traffic, the DRG Class 86 was employed as well as diesel locomotives of DB classes V 100 and V 80.

Like E. secundum, with which it has been found to hybridize in habitats disturbed by human activity, E. fulgens flowers are non-resupinate and are born in a congested racime at the end of a long spike. Like all crucifix orchids, the lip is adnate to the column and bears three lobes, producing the effect of a cross. Like E. cinnabarinum, E. denticulatum, and E. puniceoluteum (also Brazilian members of subsection carinata), E. fulgens grows in the litoral restinga habitat. The specific epithet, fulgens, is the present participle of the Latin verb fulgere \\"to shine, to glow\\" and refers to the brilliant yellow-orange flowers with red spots on the yellow lip.  Distinguishing characteristics  E. fulgens has a noticeably wider angle (nearly 180¬∞) between the lateral sepals than most of the crucifix orchids, as well as a noticeably narrower angle (little more than 90¬∞) between the petals. The yellow lip bears striking red spots in two lines near the callus. The roots are produced mostly near the bottom of the stem. E. fulgens is easily distinguished from E. radicans and E. ibaguense by its non-resupinate flowers. Perhaps the most noticeable difference between E. fulgens and E. secundum is the callus: E. fulgens has a small keel in front of the column, flanked by two calli, whereas E. secundum has a single, much larger callus in front of the column. Additionally, E. fulgens is not found in the mountainous habitat where E. secundum usually grows. E. fulgens differs from E. puniceoluteum and E. cinnabarinum by having slightly smaller yellow-orange flowers with a yellow lip, instead of bright red. The chromosome number of E. fulgens has been determined by two separate investigators as 2n = 24Table 4 of Pinheiro F, Koehler S, CorreÀÜa AM et al. \\"Phylogenetic relationships and infrageneric classification of Epidendrum subgenus Amphiglottium (Laeliinae, Orchidaceae)\\".

This number differs from E. puniceoluteum (with 52), E. secundum (with 28‚Äî80), E. cinnabarinum (with 240), E. radicans (with 40‚Äî64), and E. ibaguense (with 70).

The plans are those presented by Heathrow Airport Holdings and an independent proposal by Heathrow Hub with the main object of increasing capacity. In early December 2006, the Department for Transport published a progress report on the strategy which confirmed the original vision of expanding the runways. In November 2007 the government started a public consultation on its proposal for a slightly shorter third runway () and a new passenger terminal. The plan was publicly supported by many businesses, the aviation industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and the then Labour government. It was publicly opposed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties as opposition parties and then as a coalition government, by Boris Johnson (then Mayor of London), many environmental, local advocacy groups and prominent individuals. Although the expansion was cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the new coalition government, the Airport Commission published its various-options comparative study \\"Final Report\\" on 1 July 2015 which preferred the plan. On 25 October 2016, a new northwest runway and terminal was adopted as central Government policy. In late June 2018, the resultant National Policy Statement: Airports was debated and voted on by the House of Commons; the House voted 415‚Äì119 in favour of the third runway, within which outcome many local MPs, including a majority of those from London, opposed or abstained. On 27 February 2020, in an application for judicial review brought by environmental campaigning groups, London councils, and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the Court of Appeal ruled that the government's decision to proceed with building the third runway were unlawful, as the government's commitments to combat climate change under the Paris Agreement were not taken into account. In response, the government announced it would not appeal against the decision, but Heathrow announced its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Plans  = Third runway and additional terminal = Map of Heathrow Airport showing the original proposed extension and third runway; T1 and T2 have merged into the new T2 terminal In January 2009, the then Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that the UK government supported the expansion of Heathrow by building a third runway (2200 m long) serving a new passenger terminal, a hub for public and private transport set apart from the Central hub between terminals 2 and 3, the southern hub of 4 and western hub of Terminal 5. The government would encourage the airport operator (BAA) to apply for planning permission and to carry out the work. The government anticipated that the new runway would be operational in 2015 or soon after. In 2009 the government stipulated it would limit extra flights to 125,000 per year until 2020, rather than the full capacity of circa 222,000. The third runway plans drafted involve compulsory acquisition and demolition of approximately 700 homes for which 125% market value would be paid to compensate families. In January 2009 more detailed plans for a third runway were government backed subject to funding, legal and parliamentary approval, together with a terminal which would include a Heathrow Hub railway station to provide the first extra- London rail link using the Great Western Main Line, perhaps at the global definition of \\"high speed\\", involving the national High Speed 2 new railway project. In March 2010 the route for High Speed 2 was announced. It did not include a direct connection with Heathrow, but did include a new station at Old Oak Common before reaching the London terminus of Paddington - also served by Crossrail. On 12 May 2010, expansion was cancelled as part of the coalition agreement agreed by the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat government. BAA formally dropped its plans on 24 May 2010. However, London First, a lobby group representing many of London's businesses and major employers, continued to press the coalition government to rethink their opposition to the expansion of the airport. On 1 July 2015, the Airports Commission recommended the third runway with further terminal, with a projected capacity (on completion) of 740,000 flights per year. On 25 June 2018, the House of Commons voted 415-119 in favour of the third runway. The project has received approval from most of the government. A judicial review of the decision was launched by four London boroughs affected by the expansion ‚Äì Wandsworth, Richmond, Hillingdon and Hammersmith & Fulham ‚Äì in partnership with Greenpeace and London mayor Sadiq Khan. Khan had previously said he would take legal action if it were passed by Parliament. = Northwest runway = In July 2013, the airport submitted three new proposals for expansion to the Airports Commission, which was established to review airport capacity in south-east England. The Commission was chaired by Howard Davies who, at the time of his appointment was in the employ of GIC Private Limited and a member of its International Advisory Board. Since 2012, GIC Private Limited has been one of Heathrow's principal owners. Davies resigned these positions upon confirmation of his appointment to lead the Airports Commission, although it has been observed that he failed to identify these interests when invited to complete the Commission's register of interests. Each of the three proposals that were to be considered by the Commission involved the construction of a third runway, to either the north, the north-west or the south-west of the current airport site. The commission released its interim report in December 2013. This shortlisted three options: *the north-west third runway option at Heathrow *extending an existing runway at Heathrow *a second runway at Gatwick Airport The full report was published on 1 June 2015; this confirmed the north-west runway and a new sixth terminal as the commission's chosen proposal. The commission estimated the cost as around ¬£18.6 billion; ¬£4 billion higher than Heathrow's own estimate. The north-west runway and terminal plan was approved by Government on 25 October 2016. In January 2018, in a public consultation, Heathrow unveiled another option with the new runway 300 metres shorter, to reduce costs from ¬£16.8 billion to ¬£14.3 billion. This option would still require the M25 motorway to be diverted to a tunnel under the runway, 150 metres west of its current route. The financing of the expansion has yet to be arranged; Heathrow Airport Holdings' finances are already highly leveraged. In 2017 borrowings were ¬£13.4 billion, with shareholder's equity of only ¬£0.7 billion.  Support  = Reasons for expansion = The principal argument stated in favour of expanding Heathrow is to enhance the economic growth of the UK. As the UK's major hub airport, Heathrow can attract many transfer passengers, and so can support a very wide range of direct flight destinations at high frequencies. It is the world's second busiest airport, based on numbers of international passengers. The government claims that Heathrow's connectivity helps London (and nearby counties) especially compete with other European cities for business investment, which in turn produces economic benefits for the rest of the UK. Should Heathrow's connectivity decline compared to London's European competitors, the UK would fall behind. The government's argument is that Heathrow is on the brink of suffering a decline in connectivity. Heathrow's runways are now operating at around 99% capacity, which increases delays when flights are disrupted, and risks competing European airports gaining destinations (at Heathrow's loss). The government estimates that building a third runway would allow Heathrow to increase its connectivity, bringing ¬£5.5bn of economic benefits over the period 2020-2080. However, the British Chambers of Commerce estimated the economic benefits are ¬£30 billion for the UK economy over the same time scale, and has also stated that every year the programme is delayed costs the UK between ¬£900 million and ¬£1.1 billion. Some of the capacity added to Heathrow by the new third runway could be used to reinstate or improve flight connections to UK cities. Several cities have seen their connections to Heathrow reduced or lost over recent years as airlines have reallocated the airport's limited capacity to more profitable long-haul flights. It was suggested that a third runway would increase Heathrow's resilience to disruption, and so reduce emissions from aircraft waiting to land. Construction was estimated to provide up to 60,000 jobs. Operating the expanded Heathrow was expected to create up to 8,000 new jobs at Heathrow by 2030, with multiplier benefits to West London. = Supporters = The UK's Brown ministry took the lead in driving forward the expansion of Heathrow. The particular members of that government most closely associated with that drive were the Prime Minister Gordon Brown and past Transport Secretaries Alistair Darling, Ruth Kelly, Geoff Hoon and Andrew Adonis. Peter Mandelson, the then Business Secretary, also voiced his support for the scheme. The majority of the UK Conservative Party leadership including former Chancellor George Osborne was also in favour of expansion. The stance of both Labour and the Conservatives was broadly supported by a number of groups and prominent individuals: * Aviation sector: including BAA Limited and Flying Matters. * Airlines: including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. * Airports: including Glasgow Airport, Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leeds Bradford Airport, Newcastle International Airport and Aberdeen Airport. * Business organisations: Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce and 32 local chambers of commerce, including the London Chamber of Commerce and West London Business. *Local authorities: Slough * Manufacturing & freight sector: including the Freight Transport Association, the British International Freight Association, the EEF, Segro and Black & Decker. * Trade unions: including the GMB Union, Trades Union Congress and Unite the Union. = Advocacy in support of expansion = In May 2007, the British Airports Authority (BAA) and several other companies involved with aviation established Flying Matters to lobby the UK government and generally advocate for the development of the airport following on from a suggestion from Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic that aviation industry needed to develop a shared solution to climate change. The organisation was created to help demonstrate that the aviation sector was \\"taking climate change seriously\\". In 2009 Greenpeace acquired and published a detailed confidential report into the group activities and plans which claimed that The Department for Transport was independently approaching Flying Matters for support on key issues on the Climate change bill. Prior to the 2007 party conferences Flying Matters issued a number of press releases aimed at the Conservative Party which challenged their opposition to the third runway: \\"Voters in key marginals shun Conservative proposals for higher taxes on air travel\\", \\"'Green' holiday tax plan puts Conservatives 6 per cent behind Labour in 30 most important marginals in the Country\\",\\"Families will be priced out of air travel if Heathrow fails to expand\\" and \\"Stopping new runways would cost half a million new UK jobs\\". The objectives outlined in the leaked 'draft Strategy and programme for 2009-10' later confirmed that the organisation felt that it was \\"Essential to help establish a foundation from which the Conservatives could amend their position post election\\". The organisation's budget for 2008-2009 was ¬£390 thousand. = Lobbying = The aviation sector had close links with political decision makers which many players moving between roles through the controversial 'revolving door'. For example: Joe Irvin was advisor to John Prescott from 1996 and 2001 (Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions as well as Deputy Prime Minister) before working for various element of the aviation lobby and becoming head of corporate affairs at BAA in 2006 before he became 'Special Advisor' to Gordon Brown in 2007 when he became prime minister. He was succeeded at BAA by Tom Kelly who took the title 'group director of corporate and public affairs' and had been official spokesman for Tony Blair when he was prime minister. Freedom to Fly was formed during the preparation phase of the \\"Future of Aviation white paper 2003\\" by BAA and others It was 'fronted' by Joe Irvin, a former political adviser to John Prescott who subsequently became Director of Public Affairs at BAA Limited Their director, Dan Hodges, is the son of Glenda Jackson, Labour MP and former Aviation Minister.  Opposition  = Greenhouse gas emissions = Environmental objections have included that the increased emissions caused by the additional flights will add to global warming. They have argued that claimed economic benefits would be more than wiped out by the cost of the emissions. The government estimated that a third runway would generate an extra 210.8 Mt (million tons) annually, but in cost- benefits analysis costs this at ¬£13.33 per ton using 2006 prices, giving a 2020-2080 \\"cost\\" of ¬£2.8bn. This is a small fraction of the government's own official estimate of the cost of carbon, which rises from ¬£32.90 in 2020 to ¬£108.20 in 2080 (in 2007 prices). If these figures are used, the carbon cost of the third runway alone rises to ¬£13.3bn (2006 prices), enough to wipe out the economic benefits. However, the British Chambers of Commerce released a report stating the economic benefits as ¬£30 billion over the same time scale, considerably more than the carbon cost of the expansion. The World Development Movement has claimed that the proposed additional flights from Heathrow's third runway would emit the same amount of as the whole of Kenya. However, the then Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly stated that carbon emissions would not actually rise overall in the environment, since carbon trading would be used to ensure that these increases from Heathrow are offset by reductions elsewhere in the economy. = Community destruction = Some 700 homes, a church and eight Grade II-listed buildings would have to be demolished or abandoned, the high street in Harmondsworth split, a graveyard \\"bulldozed\\" and the \\"entire village of Sipson could disappear\\". John McDonnell, MP for Hayes and Harlington, suggested in 2007 that up to 4,000 houses would actually have to be demolished or abandoned, but aviation minister Jim Fitzpatrick defended the plans, saying anyone evicted from their home as a result of expansion would be fully compensated. BAA has committed to preserving the Grade I-listed parish church and Great Barn at Harmondsworth, and has given assurances that the value of properties affected by a possible third runway will be protected. = Noise and air pollution = Building a third runway at Heathrow would expose hundreds of thousands of residents in London and Berkshire to sustained high levels of aircraft noise for the first time. = Subsidiary arguments = * There are alternatives to a third runway that maintain London's connectivity (see below). * Reductions in emissions caused by fewer aircraft delays (a buffer of spare capacity) and a few fewer flights from some regional airports would be dwarfed by the increased emissions from the additional flights serving Heathrow, as reflected by the promise to open up many airports not currently connected which will now connect to the UK. * Job creation claims are invalid. If the money supporting the new jobs generated by a third runway was not spent at an expanded Heathrow, it would be spent elsewhere in the economy. = Opponents of expansion = Seats of opposing MPs in green, supporting in light blue (and 12 absent or abstaining in grey) in this map of c. 30 miles, square, on 25 June 2018 Three House of Commons-represented political parties, many advocacy groups, associations and prominent people are publicly opposed to expansion. Notably: * Plaid Cymru (including its five MPs at the time of the June 2018 vote on whether to approve the National Policy Statement)Hansard 25 June 2018 Division 192: National Policy Statement: Airports * The Liberal Democrats (including thus all 11 MPs at the June 2018 vote, however it has gained six MPs from defections of which five voted for expansion in 2018). *The Green Party (including its MP). * of London Labour MPs: Rosena Allin-Khan, Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler, Lyn Brown, Karen Buck, Ruth Cadbury, Jeremy Corbyn, Marsha De Cordova, Jon Cruddas, John Cryer, Janet Daby, Emma Dent Coad, Clive Efford, Barry Gardiner, Helen Hayes, Kate Hoey, Rupa Huq, Sarah Jones, Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Kate Osamor, Teresa Pearce, Matthew Pennycook, Steve Reed, Ellie Reeves, Andy Slaughter, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Catherine West * of London Conservative MPs: Bob Blackman, Zac Goldsmith, Justine Greening, Greg Hands, Matthew Offord, and Theresa Villiers. The 2018 vote drew five absences/abstentions from others in the nineteen. * Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, and his predecessors, Boris Johnson but who visited Afghanistan at the time of the important 2018 vote and Ken Livingstone. * International campaign groups criticising expansion of fossil-fuel powered passenger aviation (foremost group: Plane Stupid) and local anti-aviation impacts groups (foremost group: Hacan ClearSkies).Hacan ClearSkies * The immediately local government authority (the London Borough of Hillingdon), 2M Group of 24 local authorities. * Environmental campaign groups: Greenpeace, RSPB, Friends of the Earth and WWF, which have a combined British membership of more than 2.5m people * The National Trust, with 3.5 million members * Developmental charities: Oxfam, Christian Aid = Advocacy against expansion = Plane Stupid activists on the roof of the Palace of Westminster in 2008 complaining about BAA's close links with government Terminal 5's opening hundreds of protesters descended on Heathrow in red Stop Heathrow Expansion T-shirts. The protest was kept out of the news by Terminal 5's opening day baggage system problem. Various methods were proposed and adopted in attempt to halt expansion: The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats opposed construction and cancelled expansion when elected in the 2010 general election. In August 2007, the Camp for Climate Action took place within a mile of Heathrow. The camp ran for a week and on its final day some 1000-1400 people protested and 200 people blockaded British Airports Authority HQ. Before the camp BAA requested the \\"mother of all injunctions\\" which could have restricted the movements of 5 million people from 15 different organisations, including the RSPB, Greenpeace, the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, the Woodland Trust, Friends of the Earth, and the National Trust. The injunction would technically have included the Queen; patron of the RSPB and CPRE, Prince Charles; in his position as President of the National Trust, and even some of BAA's own staff. In February 2008, five members of Plane Stupid who have resisted expansion throughout the process staged a 2-hour protest on the roof of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) in protest at the close links between BAA and the government. Two large banners were unfurled which read \\"BAA HQ\\" and \\"No 3rd runway at Heathrow\\". In April 2008, Plane Stupid claimed that their group was infiltrated by Toby Kendall, 24, an employee of C2i International. The Times reported that he had gone undercover in the group using the name of \\"Ken Tobias.\\" Airport operator, BAA, who have often been a target of Plane Stupid's campaign, confirmed to The Times that they had been in contact with C2i International but denied ever hiring the company. C2i offered their clients \\"The ability to operate effectively and securely in a variety of hostile environments\\". and at the time listed 'aerospace' at the top of a list of industries for which it worked. Certificate of beneficial ownership issued by Greenpeace in respect of the Airplot at Sipson. In January 2009, Greenpeace and partners (including actress Emma Thompson and impressionist Alistair McGowan) bought a piece of land on the site of the proposed third runway called Airplot. Their aim is to maximise the opportunities to put legal obstacles in the way of expansion. Although this action is similar to the tactics first employed in the early 1980s by FoE with the 'Alice's Meadow' campaign; it differs in that it relies on the concept of multiple beneficial ownership rather than the division of the field into microplots. The field was bought for an undisclosed sum from a local land owner. Also in January, Climate Rush staged a \\"picnic protest\\" at Heathrow airport against the construction of the third runway. Hundreds of people attended the protest, dressed in Edwardian period dress. In the same month the glass doors of the Department for Transport were also broken by members of the organisation. In March 2009, senior MPs demanded a Commons investigation into evidence of a \\"revolving door\\" policy between Downing Street, Whitehall and BAA Limited (BAA is a major UK airport operator). Also in March 2009, Plane Stupid protester Leila Deen threw green custard over Business Secretary Lord Mandelson at a low carbon summit hosted by Gordon Brown, in protest at the frequent meetings between Roland Rudd, who represents airport operator BAA, and Mandelson and other ministers in the run-up to Labour's decision to go ahead with plans for a third runway at Heathrow. Hounslow Council examined the possibility of legal action to prevent expansion, with the support of other London councils and the mayor (Boris Johnson). In February 2010, The Daily Telegraph reported that the Department for Transport was being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office and could face a criminal investigation over allegations that it may have deleted or concealed emails to prevent them from being disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The investigation followed a complaint by Justine Greening MP. In March 2010 campaigners \\"won a High Court battle\\" when Lord Justice Carnwath ruled that the government's policy support for a third runway would need to be looked at again, and called for a review \\"of all the relevant policy issues, including the impact of climate change policy\\". The Department for Transport vowed to \\"robustly defend\\" the third runway plan. Following the announcement, Gordon Brown, the prime minister, said it was the right decision, that it was \\"vital not just to our national economy, but enables millions of citizens to keep in touch with their friends and families\\" and that the judgement would not change its plans. Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said that the ruling meant \\"Labour's flagship transport policies were in complete disarray\\". On 6 August 2018, lawyers for Friends of the Earth filed papers at the High Court asking for the Airports National Policy Statement (NPS) to be quashed. Friends of the Earth argues that the Airports NPS constitutes a breach of the UK's climate change policy and its sustainable development duties.  Alternatives to expansion  The main suggested alternatives to Heathrow expansion included: * greater use of regional airports in the UK to create more capacity in the South East, * planned greater use of High Speed 2 which will reduce domestic flights, or * a whole new airport altogether. = Better utilisation of existing capacity = It has been suggested that using larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 could significantly free up landing slots and relieve congestion. As an example, British Airways has eight flights a day on the Heathrow to New York route which use a mixture of Boeing 747s, Boeing 767s, Boeing 777s, Airbus A330s and Airbus A350s; using the A380 could theoretically cut down the number of flights whilst maintaining the same number of daily seats between the two airports. Airlines on such routes tend to be reluctant as to these, chiefly as customers' current wide choice of flight times creates an inertia in favour of that status quo. But campaigners against the third runway say it would reduce airport congestion. However, this rationale was upended at least in part when Airbus announced in April 2019 that it would be discontinuing production of the A380, though aircraft such as the 747 also require runways longer than most. 'Mixed mode' take off and landing is another method to increase utilisation, backed by British Airways. = Greater use of other airports near London = There are six airports in or near London, some of which could achieve a higher capacity with certain expansions. Luton Airport and Southend Airport have capacity, but expansion of runway and terminal would be needed. Expansion of Gatwick Airport has been seriously considered, and Stansted Airport is also considering expansion, but a new runway would be needed in either case. Many passengers use London as a transfer point to and from long-distance flights, most of which use Heathrow. Ground transfer between Heathrow and other London airports is generally time- consuming (often taking two hours or longer). There is a suggestion to build a railway called Heathwick between Heathrow and Gatwick, making transfers between them easier. = Greater use of regional airports = The United Kingdom has a number of regional airports, which it had been argued can be utilised further to reduce the airport capacity strain on South East England and benefit the whole of the United Kingdom. The 2003 Aviation White Paper mainly argued that increased use of regional airports would increase airport capacity in South East England; and the 2010 coalition government concurred with this view. Politicians proposing this plan included Theresa Villiers and John Leech. Business leaders to back the plan include bosses at Birmingham and Cardiff Airports. The CEO of Manchester Airports Group, the largest British- owned operator of airports and member of the influential Aviation Foundation along with Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and BAA Limited, has also proposed greater use of regional airports. A number of airline bosses expressed their dissatisfaction at the over-emphasis on the South East in aviation policy. Laurie Berryman of Emirates Airlines said in 2013 that \\"The business community doesn't want to come to Heathrow or the South East. They would rather fly long-haul from their local airport.\\" A number of airlines have filled in the gap when British Airways have left regional airports over the past decade. Another major issue at regional airports was \\"leakage\\", or passengers who need to get connecting flights from a regional airport to an international airport. Manchester Airport is by far the busiest and largest airport outside South East England, with two runways. Four million passengers - about 20% of all passengers - need to fly from Manchester to London to get connecting long-haul flights abroad. Likewise, many more millions fly from other regional airports to connecting flights in London. Advocates argue that flying to international destinations directly from regional airports would immediately create more airport capacity in the South East at a fraction of the cost and time of having a build a new runway or airport. Furthermore, numerous regional airports are underused, and need no immediate expense to take on more passengers. Manchester is the only airport in the United Kingdom other than Heathrow to have two runways and is severely under capacity: Manchester carries 20 million passengers, but has the capacity to carry at least 50 million. Proponents of this idea also suggest the new High Speed 2 network will be vital to the success of regional airports in the future. HS2 will link the three airports of Birmingham, Manchester and East Midlands with London. Furthermore, journey times will be competitive: a journey from London Euston to Birmingham Airport will be less than 50 minutes, and to Manchester about 65 minutes - in comparison, the Heathrow Express service to London Paddington takes 25 minutes. Currently rail links exist from London Euston to Birmingham International which takes about 70 minutes, whilst journeys to Manchester take over 2 hours with a change required at Manchester Piccadilly station. It was hoped airlines would create a \\"north-south hub\\" with more flights from Manchester, with passengers who live or work in London being only an hour away from the airport - thus spreading demand to regional airports and creating more international hub capacity in the South East. = Thames Estuary Airport = Since the 1970s, there have been various proposals to complement or replace Heathrow by a new airport in the Thames Estuary. This would have the advantage of avoiding flights taking off and landing over London, with all the accompanying noise and pollution, and would avoid destroying homes, nature and amenity land on the western edge of London. In November 2008, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced a feasibility study into building an airport on an artificial island off the Isle of Sheppey. Critics pointed variously to the construction costs, threat to jobs at Heathrow, and opponents in green ideology as with all expansion cite increased emissions if more flights are scheduled than at present. Following an election pledge not to build a third runway, Prime Minister David Cameron was keen to implement the Thames Estuary hub. However, airlines spoke out against plans to partially fund the airport with around ¬£8 billion in landing charges from Heathrow. An aviation review was set for the end of 2012 and Cameron had advised: \\"I do understand it is vitally important that we maintain the sort of hub status that Britain has. There are lots of different options that can be looked at.\\" = High-speed rail = The three main parties represented within the UK support a high-speed railway to the north. * In July 2008, Arup proposed a short but urban link from Heathrow directly to High Speed 1 (map) so passengers transiting to/from the near Continent to/from other destinations could do so landside, at a cost of ¬£4.5bn. *In September 2008, the Conservative party proposed as HM Opposition such a northern railway and suggested that it would reduce the need for short-haul flights, by encouraging passengers to complete their journey by train instead of flying. By pruning short-haul flights from Heathrow, international flights could increase and so connectivity enhance. They predicted that it would allow the cessation of 66,430 domestic flights per year, 30% of the capacity of the third runway. * In March 2010 in the final months of the Labour government it published detailed plans for High Speed 2 which would link London with Birmingham and then Scotland - incorporating a new Old Oak Common railway station in West London which would 'improve surface access by rail to Heathrow Airport.'DfT (2009a), page 17 paragraph 41 instead of any direct westward rail link for Heathrow. For various reasons its pencilled route did not run alongside West Coast Main Line.DfT (2009a), pages 12-16 paragraphs 32-37 It did believe that there would be some \\"modal shift\\" to rail from road and air.DfT (2009a), page 18 paragraph 47 but not for passengers who arrived at Heathrow by air who it was felt would continue to go by air to their UK destination. HS2 Ltd anticipate 8% of its users would switch from aviation. = Reduce demand = An alternative suggestion to relieve the pressure on Heathrow without building a third runway was made: * Personal carbon trading had the potential to encourage individuals to voluntarily change their behaviour and reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.

The character first appeared in the one- shot \\"Darker Image\\"Darker Image #1 (1993) in 1993, published by Image Comics. The character later appeared in a Bloodwulf mini-seriesBloodwulf #1-4 (1995) from 1995 in four issues, illustrated by Daerick Gross Sr.. He also appeared in a one-shot from 1995 entitled \\"Bloodwulf Summer Special\\"Bloodwulf Summer Special #1 (1995) where he was pitted against Supreme. Fictional character biography Bloodwulf is an alien bounty hunter from the planet Luap'ur where he lives with his multiple wives and brood of children. He craves a life of action, however, and is always ready and willing to leave his quiet, domestic life behind for grand space adventures. His mother, Redwulf, and grandmother, Califia, are also formidable star farers. Bloodwulf's powers include enhanced strength and a personal force field which allows him to breathe in the vacuum of space. Bloodwulf vs. Lobo Bloodwulf as created by Liefeld is very similar to the DC Comics character Lobo. In fact, the cover to Bloodwulf #1 Bloodwulf #1 (1995) depicts Lobo hanging dead in the background, signifying that Bloodwulf has symbolically replaced Lobo as the toughest comic character around. Lobo actually appears in Bloodwulf #2 Bloodwulf #2 (1995) as a whining, drunken loser whose days of glory are long past because the character was taken out of the hands of his original creators and overexposed by corporate money men. One of Lobo's creators, Keith Giffen, did the plot and art breakdowns for the Bloodwulf \\"Summer Special\\". Rather than being an expansion of the Lobo \\"idea,\\" however, Bloodwulf was almost a direct copy of the character.http://www.comicvine.com/bloodwulf/29-26951/ Bloodwulf @ comicvine The two characters look strikingly similar with only the color scheme differing. Bloodwulf's hair (which is a little taller) and facial tattoo (which is a little bigger) are red whereas Lobo's are black. Bloodwulf also rides a suped-up space motorcycle, as does his predecessor. Even the story plots take a similar tack, both having a science fiction theme while relying heavily on parody and excessive violence. If at all possible, Lobo's humor was a little more subtle and sophisticated, actually poking fun at ultra-violent comics and the fans who enjoyed them. On the other hand, Bloodwulf's humor is more standard fare, poking fun at science fiction standards like Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens in a more juvenile Mad Magazine fashion. The first issue of the Bloodwulf limited series has a pair of droids approaching the bounty hunter with a hidden message from a captured princess asking him to find a reclusive hermit who is her \\"only hope.\\" Issue #2 has Bloodwulf visiting the Pleasure Plaza, a space station that looks like a brothelized version of Star Trek Deep Space Nine (including having a Ferengi bar tender). The final villain of the limited series Bloodwulf #4 (1995) is a verbose soliloquizer who is an amalgamation of Darth Vader and Sandman writer Neil Gaiman (called \\"Gaimanwank\\" in the story).

The roof of the main station building is seen above a cottage and an LNWR local train stands in the platform. An LNWR sign is affixed to the left hand side of the bridge, promoting services from the station. The London and North Western Railway completed its line from Stockport Edgeley to Northenden in 1866. The station was opened on 1 August 1866 and was located 100 yards (90 m) north of Cheadle High street at the point where the line (still in use) crossed Manchester Road on an over-bridge. The station was located on the western side of the road and was reached by steps leading up to it. Two platforms were provided. The northern platform handled trains from Warrington to Stockport and the southern side was for trains heading west to Warrington and Liverpool. Train services and closure On the opening of the line and the station in 1866, the LNWR immediately commenced operating a passenger train service from Manchester London Road via Stockport Edgeley to Cheadle and onwards to Northenden to Broadheath, Warrington Arpley and on to Liverpool Lime Street. In December 1895, 20 trains per weekday operated from Manchester via Stockport. Seven of these continued on to Broadheath near Altrincham, and two of these continued to Liverpool.Bradshaw, 1895, p. 345 The service was discontinued on 1 January 1917 and the station was closed that day.

It flows from the Greenland ice sheet () in the western direction. The front of the glacier is located east of Kangerlussuaq. It is active, advancing every year, and due to easy access from Kangerlussuaq, it remains a popular place for tourists to visit.  Geography  The ice sheet outflow ending in Russell Glacier is bounded from the north by the tundra highland of Isunngua and from the south by an exposed, barren, flattened ridge of Akuliarusiarsuk. Several meltwater outflow streams from the base of the glacier form the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua river, which flows west-south-west towards Kangerlussuaq. The sandur basin of the outflow river forming the valley of the same name () is very shallow; shallow enough to form quicksand fields several kilometers long. Directly to the west of the glacier is a large lake, the 2x10km Aajuitsup Tasia. Due to minimal height differential, its waters are not conjoint with the meltwater outflow lake immediately to the west of Russell Glacier. A sibling, unnamed glacier approximately to the southeast of Russell Glacier is the source to the wide outflow meltwater river of Qinnguata Kuussua. The confluence of the latter and the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua river flowing from Russell Glacier is located at the eastern outskirts of the Kangerlussuaq settlement near the end of Kangerlussuaq Fjord, and used to be known as Watson River. {- valign=\\"top\\" View of the Glacier } Methane cycling below the glacier A 2014 study found based on subglacial drainage samples (dominated by Proteobacteria), evidence for methane cycling below the ice sheet of the Russell Glacier. During the study, on 12 July 2012 the most widespread surface melt on record for the past 120 years was observed in Greenland, unfrozen water was present on almost the entire ice sheet surface (98.6%). The findings indicate that methanotrophs could serve as a biological methane sink in the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was at least during the sample time, a source of atmospheric methane. Scaled dissolved methane flux during the 4 months of the summer melt season was estimated at 990 Mg CH4. Because the Russell-Leverett Glacier is representative of similar Greenland outlet glaciers, the researchers concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet may represent a significant global methane source.

Thousands of members around the world work together to impress the record of Churchill's life and deeds on the 21st century. The Society's exhibits are located at the Churchill War Rooms in London, and the National Churchill Library and Center at the George Washington University in Washington D.C. The Society sponsors an annual International Churchill Conference and numerous regional events honouring today's leaders; Churchill tours in Britain, Australia, France, South Africa and Morocco; academic symposia; student seminars; and the periodic Churchill Lecture, in which prominent world figures apply Sir Winston's experience to today's issues. With grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Society has conducted seminars for high school teachers in the USA and UK. The International Churchill Society is politically non-partisan, but not apolitical. Its quarterly journal, Finest Hour, often touches on Churchill's political philosophy and its relevance to today's issues. Speakers have spanned the political and cultural spectrum: William F. Buckley, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr, Alistair Cooke, William Manchester, Andrew Roberts, Lord Watson of Richmond, David Lough, Sir David Cannadine members of the Churchill family, and many others. While the International Churchill Society's view of its subject is naturally positive, it is not hagiographic and publishes critiques as well as praise. According to Roosevelt-Churchill historian Warren Kimball, \\"Finest Hour has become a serious (and still entertaining) journal, earning the sobriquet 'The Journal of Winston Churchill,' which has taken Churchill from the clutches of the worshipful and given him over to the appreciative‚Äîthose who can look at him, warts and all.\\" The most recent patron of the International Churchill Society was The Lady Soames LG DBE from 1983 until her death in 2014. She was youngest daughter of Winston Churchill and his wife Clementine Churchill. From 1970 to 1979, the patron was Lord Mountbatten of Burma. The Society's offices are located in Washington, D.C. at the National Churchill Library and Center (NCLC). History The predecessor organizations were the Winston S. Churchill Study Unit (1968), a chapter of the American Topical Association, and The Churchill Centre. In 1995, responding to an appeal by Lady Soames, over 600 people around the world became founding members of the Society. In 2008 The Churchill Centre merged with the American Friends of the Churchill Museum, to form The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Cabinet War Rooms, London. In 2016, with the opening of the National Churchill Library and Center in Washington, D.C., The Churchill Centre was merged into a newly formed entity once again called the International Churchill Society which combined the memberships of The Churchill Centre and the Friends of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri.

The fort of Purandhar stands at 4,472 ft (1,387 m) above the sea level in the Western Ghats, 50 km to the southeast of Pune. The twin forts of Purandar and Vajragad (or Rudramal) of which the latter is the smaller of the two, is located on the eastern side of the main fort.

History  The oldest known reference to the Purandar dates back to the Yadava Dynasty in the 11th century. After the defeat of the Yadavas by the Persian invaders, the territory surrounding the fort fell into the hands of the Persians who further fortified the Purandar Fort in 1350 A.D. During the early rule of the Bijapur and Ahmednagar kings, The Purandar Fort was among the forts directly under the Government rule and was never entrusted to Jagirdars (estate holders). Under the rule of the Berar Sultanate, The fort was besieged several times. To prevent the Purandar Fort from ever falling again, A sacrificial ritual was performed where a man and a woman were buried alive under one of the fort bastions to appease its patron deity. Sholapur District Gazetteer Another ritual was soon performed where the king ordered a minister to bury a first born son and his mother into the foundation of the bastion which was promptly done with a further offering of gold and bricks. When the bastion was finished, The minister, Yesaji Naik, was given possession of the Purandar Fort and the father of the sacrificed boy was rewarded with two villages. In 1596 A.D, the Bahudar Shah of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate granted the territory of \\"Pune\\" and \\"Supa\\" to Maloji Raje Bhosale, the grandfather of Shivaji Maharaj. The Purandar Fort was included in the territory. In 1646 A.D, a young Shivaji Raje in one of his first victories for the Maratha Empire, raided and established control of the fort. Vajragad fort In 1665 A.D, The Purandar Fort was besieged by the forces of Aurangzeb, under the command of Mirza Raje JaiSingh and assisted by Diler Khan. Murarbaji Deshpande of Mahr, who was appointed as the killedar (keeper of the fort), offered strong resistance against the Mughal forces ultimately giving up his life in a struggle to retain the fort. Shivaji Maharaj daunted at the prospect of the fall of his grandfather's fort, signed a treaty known as the First Treaty of Purandar with Aurangzeb in 1665. According to the treaty, Shivaji Maharaj handed over twenty-three forts including Purandar, and a territory with a revenue of four lakh hons Shivaji Raje was made the jagirdar of the territory. In 1670 A.D, The truce did not last long as Shivaji Maharaj revolted against Aurangzeb and recaptured Purandar after just five years. Under the Peshwa rule, The Purandar Fort acted as a stronghold whenever their capital city of Pune was under attack. In 1776 A.D, a treaty was signed between the British Raj and the Maratha States known as the Second Treaty of Purandar. Its conditions were never fulfilled, being overruled by the subsequent Treaty of Salbai in 1782 between the Bombay Government and Raghunathrao, at the close of the First Anglo-Maratha War. In 1790, It was conquered by a Koli chief Kuroji Naik and a Victory Bastion also erected here. In 1818, The Purandar Fort was invested by a British force under General Pritzler. On 14 March 1818, a British garrison marched into Vajragad (the smaller fort). As Vajragad commanded Purandar, the commandant had to accept terms and the British flag was hoisted at Purandar on 16 March 1818. During the British Raj, the fort was used as a prison. During World War II, it was an internment camp for enemy-alien (i.e. German) families. Jews from Germany were interned. A German prisoner, Dr. H. Goetz was held here during World War II. He studied the fort during his stay and later published a book on it. The fort's major use however, was as a sanatorium for the British soldiers. The thousand year old Narayaneshwar temple of the Hemadpanthi architecture built by the Yadavas still exists at the base village of the fort called Narayanpur. Temple of the Purandeshwar deity from which Purandar takes its name It is believed that Purandar is the broken part of the Dronagiri Parvat, which Hanuman carried in the Ramayana.  Structures  Cannon at the top of the fort The fort has two distinct levels. The lower part of purandar is called the machi. North of the machi is a flat area where the cantonment and hospital was housed. There are many temples dedicated to Purandareshwar (the fort's patron god, from which it also takes its name) and Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa here. There is a statue of Murarbaji Deshpande, the commander (killedar) of the fort who gave up his life in order to protect the fort from the Mughals. The northern part of the machi has a low fall with several bastions and an imposing gate with two towers.

Located in an open-cut from the St. George Terminal, it had two tracks and one island platform. For a few years before its closure in 1953, it was the western (railroad direction south) terminus of the North Shore Line; before then, the terminus was the Port Ivory station to the west, though most trains terminated at Arlington. It was located in the Arlington and Mariners Harbor sections of Staten Island, near the Arlington Yard, under the South Avenue overpass, between Arlington Place and Brabant Street. History The station was put up at the South Avenue grade crossing in 1889‚Äì1890. This location was where trains were turned on their way back to Saint George. The name of the neighborhood Arlington was coined after the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) purchased a farm at Old Place, on Staten Island's northwestern corner, which would become the Arlington freight yard. The B&O; renamed the area Arlington. The station originally consisted of two wooden side platforms with a stationhouse at the east end of the St. George-bound platform and ramps to South Avenue. A wooden overpass to the side of the right-of-way was located at the west end. Non- electrified freight sidings were located on both sides of the station, with a switch to the northernmost track located in the center of the station. The station was closed on March 31, 1953, along with the rest of the North Shore Branch and the South Beach Branch. The station site is currently occupied by tail tracks for the reactivated Arlington freight yard, which began serving the Howland Hook Marine Terminal in 2005. Because of this, the former station was demolished. Arlington is one of the stations to be returned to operation under the proposals for reactivation of the North Shore branch for rapid transit, light rail, or bus rapid transit service. Any new service would require a physical separation from the current freight tracks. A new terminal station has been proposed south of the original site along South Avenue between Brabant Street and Continental Place, along with a second nearby station for a proposed West Shore service at Forest Avenue.

Law The Spanish legal system is a civil law system based on comprehensive legal codes and laws rooted in Roman law, as opposed to common law, which is based on precedent court rulings. Operation of the Spanish judiciary is regulated by Organic Law 6/1985 of the Judiciary Power, Law 1/2000 of Civil Judgement, Law of September 14 1882 on Criminal Judgement, Law 29/1998 of Administrative Jurisdiction, Royal Legislative Decree 2/1995, which rewrote the Law of Labour Procedure, and Organic Law 2/1989 that regulates Military Criminal Procedure. =Constitutional principles= The Spanish Constitution guarantees respect for the essential principles necessary for the correct functioning of the judiciary: *Impartiality: to guarantee the assured effective judicial trusteeship to all citizens by the Constitution, judges must remain impartial in cases that they judge and must abstain from cases that they have no reason to enter into. *Independence: courts and tribunals are independent of all authority or people in the exercise of jurisdictional power. *Irremovability: judges and magistrates are irremovable and cannot be removed, suspended, separated or retired without cause and with guarantees established by law. *Responsibility: judges and magistrates are personally responsible for their disciplinary infractions and crimes committed in the exercise of their office; this responsibility can only be required by the established legal disciplinary tract, without interference by the executive or legislative branches of the government or through ordinary legal proceedings. *Legality: in the exercise of their jurisdictional functions, judges and magistrates are subject to the Constitution and to the rest of the laws just as other branches of government and citizens are. Court organization The judiciary can be organised into different levels of territorial organisation: * the national courts * the autonomous communities of Spain * the provinces of Spain * the judicial district, which is the basic unit of the judiciary, covers one or several municipalities, and is served by at least one first instance and inquiry court The judiciary can be also organised into five jurisdictional orders, which are each composed of several different circuits: * civil jurisdiction * criminal jurisdiction * administrative jurisdiction * labour or social jurisdiction * military jurisdiction Unipersonal courts are those courts that are controlled by one judge as opposed to the rest of the High Courts of Justice controlled by panels of judges. They are the basic units of judicial procedure in Spain. =Territorial= National =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court of Spain () is the highest judicial body in Spain. Composed of five chambers, it has cognizance of all jurisdictional orders and its rulings cannot be appealed, except to the Constitutional Court, when one of the parties claims that their constitutional rights have been infringed. =Audiencia Nacional= The , based in Madrid, has jurisdiction over the entire territory of the nation. It has four Chambers, although it is composed of 3 jurisdictions, that cover: * Appeal (no jurisdiction), will take cognizance of appeals against Criminal Jurisdiction rulings. *Criminal jurisdiction in cases pertaining to crimes against the Spanish Crown, terrorism, organized crime, counterfeiting and crimes committed in more than one jurisdiction. *Administrative jurisdiction, deals with appeal cases against resolutions of ministers, secretaries of state, the Council of Ministers] and the chiefs of staff of the armed forces. *Social jurisdiction involves cases pertaining to collective bargaining agreements that cover more than the territory of one autonomous community. The Audiencia Nacional also has specialized courts dealing with criminal inquiries, penitentiary surveillance and juvenile cases. Some jurists consider this court to be unnecessary and a successor to the Public Order Court, the political court during the Francoist Period.Moreno Catena, Victor et al.‚Ä¶. Autonomous communities =High Courts of Justice= The High Courts of Justice () have authority over a single autonomous community, and are the highest jurisdictional body of the autonomous community without prejudice to the Supreme Court.Art 152.1 CE They are divided into three Chambers covering four jurisdictional orders: *The First Chamber, or Civil and Criminal Chamber, is responsible for civil cases involving acts by the president of the autonomous community, members of the government council or of the legislature, and in cases of communities with their own civil law appealing against rulings by inferior courts. In the Case of Criminal Jurisdiction, to inquire, and proceed in cases related to public prosecutors, judges, magistrates, members of the legislature and government council, that relate to their activity within the autonomous community. *The Second or Administrative Chamber: hears appeals against resolutions of state bodies not assigned to other courts, appeals against resolutions of the government of an autonomous community or its members, appeals against resolutions of legislative bodies pertaining to administration, appeals against electoral boards and appeals against first instance rulings by administrative courts. *The Third or Social Chamber: is responsible for appeals against the rulings of first instance social courts and of cases pertaining to collective bargaining agreements that affect the territory of one autonomous community. Some examples are: * High Court of Justice of Cantabria * High Court of Justice of Castile and Le√≥n Provincial =Audiencia Provincial= The is a court that covers the territory of a single province and is responsible for two jurisdictional orders, civil and criminal. *Civil chambers: are responsible for appeals against judgements by courts of first instance. *Criminal chambers: judge serious criminal cases. =Jurisdictional= Courts of first instance The courts of first instance are the basic courts of civil jurisdiction assigned to judicial districts. They hear all cases not assigned to High Courts of Justice, and also act as courts of second instance (appeal) in relation to rulings by Justices of the Peace. Judges of first instance are usually responsible for the civil registry. Courts of inquiry Courts of inquiry are responsible for investigating all criminal cases in order for them to be judged by High Courts of Justice. In the case of smaller districts, first instance and inquiry courts are usually unified under the responsibility of one judge.Moreno Catena, Victor et al.‚Ä¶ Criminal courts Judge less serious crimes and misdemeanor, as well as acting as second instance (appeal) courts for the courts of Justices of the Peace. They are assigned to every judicial district ‚Äì a smaller division inside of a province which includes various municipalities ‚Äì. Administrative courts Are responsible for all cases corresponding to appeals for national and autonomic bodies not assigned by the constitution to other courts as of the appeals to resolutions issued by municipal bodies. They are assigned to a province. Social courts Social courts are basic courts related to labour law, and are assigned to a province. Justices of the Peace  These courts are assigned to a municipality that is not the head of a judicial district and are presided over by a justice of the peace. Their responsibilities relate to the criminal and civil orders in minor cases. Juvenile courts Criminal cases committed by those who are over 14 years old and under 18 years old are the responsibility of juvenile courts and are ruled under the Organic Law 1/2000 ‚Äúof Criminal Responsibilities of Minors‚Äù Penitentiary surveillance courts Oversee penitentiary conditions for criminals and establish penitentiary degrees or conditional freedom. =Constitutional Court= The Constitutional Court is not considered part of the judiciary, but as an independent branch of the state responsible for interpretation of the constitution. Despite this, its functionality and activities are usually similar to those of the rest of the judiciary.Moreno Catena, Victor et al. Officers of the court =Judges and magistrates= The Spanish Judiciary is a professional judiciary whose members are public servants divided into the three categories of judge, magistrate, and Supreme Court magistrateArt. 298.2 LO 6/1985 (LOPJ) Entrance to the judiciary is limited to Spanish nationals who hold a Bachelor's degree in Law issued by a Spanish university and who are not legally disbarred from applying. Applicants must pass a competitive state exam, a state exam with contest of merits, or a contest of merits.Art 301 LOPJ Selected applicants enter the Judiciary School where they take mandatory courses over a year, as well as carrying out practical courses as associate judges in courts and tribunals of the different jurisdictional orders. Candidates passing this course are then sworn in as judges.Art 307 LOPJ Magistrates of the supreme court can be drafted in a contest of merits between prestigious jurists and lawyers with more than fifteen years of professional experience.art 345 LOPJ One in every five judges of the supreme court is recruited this way.art 343 LOPJ Justices of the peace do not belong to the judiciary and are local people elected by the town council of the city where they were appointed. Judges and magistrates are banned from membership of political parties and trade unions,art 127.1 Spanish Constitution of 1978(CE) from issuing messages of congratulation or censuring public powers or official corporations, and from attending public meetings or rallies in their role as members of the judiciary.art. 395 LOPJ Governance Governance of the Spanish Judiciary is assigned to the General Council of the Judiciary. This constitutional body, although not a court in itself, is responsible for overseeing the work of all courts and tribunals of Spain, as well as of allocating judges and magistrates to each of them. The General Council is composed of 20 members, twelve of who must be judges and magistrates and the remaining eight other jurists (lawyers, professors etc.) of renowned competence and with more than fifteen years professional experience.Art. 122 Spanish Constitution Of the twelve judges, six are elected by the Congress of Deputies and six by the Senate by three fifths supermajority from a list of thirty-six candidates proposed by professional associations of judges and magistrates according to the size of their membership or any independent candidate who obtains the endorsement of two percent of their colleagues.

The commercial was later adapted into a comic book. Commercial synopsis At the beginning of the commercial, Godzilla is rampaging through Tokyo when he hears Barkley dribbling a basketball. In response, the monster dons a pair of pink goggles and prepares for a basketball game, in which the two will use the O from a Tokyo sign on a building as their hoop. Godzilla knocks the ball from Barkley's hands with his tail, but Barkley retrieves it and pushes Godzilla into a building, clearing the path for an easy slam dunk. Afterwards, Barkley and Godzilla are seen walking through the streets together, with Barkley's arm on Godzilla's shoulder. Barkley tells Godzilla that \\"the Lakers are looking for a big man\\", and the spot concludes with the Nike swoosh logo. Another ending used in the commercial has Barkley asking Godzilla \\"Have you ever thought about wearing shoes?\\" Making of the commercial Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley was conceived by advertising agency Wieden & Kennedy and produced by Industrial Light & Magic. It was originally intended for Japanese audiences, but Nike was impressed enough to use it in the United States, where it debuted on September 9, 1992, during the MTV Video Music Awards broadcast on MTV.Steve Ryfle. Japan's Favorite Mon-Star. ECW Press, 1998. 275. The commercial required eight days of filming during the first two weeks in June 1992 and four weeks of editing thereafter. Aired October 14, 1992 (video , transcript). It employs suitmation techniques, which were still being used in the Godzilla films being made by Toho. Clint Goodman of ILM explained, \\"The idea was that we would show a modern look, but not with total 'ILM realism'. It just wouldn't be true to the subject matter.\\" The Godzilla costume comprised many foam rubber pieces, and puppeteers produced the monster's facial expressions with radio control devices. Some of the miniature buildings in the commercial were originally used in the 1984 film Ghostbusters. The special effects team used mattes to create the illusion of a larger city.David Kalat.

Their single \\"Get it While It's Hot\\" (co-written by Jermaine Jackson) became a club hit and went on to spawn four remixes. He has currently 6 albums to his name, the latest is the Reggae album \\"Rise Up\\", released in 2018.  Early career  Alan is credited by many as a European pioneer of house music and electronic dance music, touring throughout Europe with an elaborate setup of 13 or more keyboards, synthesizers and rhythm boxes (in the early 1970s, at a time when the drum machine wasn't even invented yet and long before the terms house music and electronic dance music even existed). He was one of the first artists to use sampling (by means of an obscure instrument called the Optigan that used optical discs to play back musical loops. Unlike the other pioneers of electronica like Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, Alan's music was always very \\"danceable\\", full of R&B; and Soul influences and indeed the forerunner of what is now termed House music and Electronic dance music. Alan's musical style is best described as electronic World fusion music with strong Jazz and Funk influences as it combines exotic instruments and voices with jazz, funk grooves and electronica. He also draws on his many years of living in the Caribbean and working with Caribbean artists on his current Reggae album release.  Music production As a producer, Alan recorded hits for Dennis Edwards and Eddie Kendricks of the legendary Temptations, the Baha Men (of 'who let the dogs out' fame), David Black (Capitol/EMI Records) who went on a World Tour opening for MC Hammer and also appeared on his album 'Too legit to Quit', Isaac Adams (former vocalist for both the Bar Kays and Cameo). He was also asked to do a remix of the Dazz Band's #1 Billboard chart hit \\"Dazz Dazz Disco Jazz\\". His engineering credits include multi-platinum artists like: Jermaine Jackson, Melba Moore, Inner Circle, the Temptations, Evelyn 'Champagne' King and Melissa Manchester.  Film scoring  In the past years, Alan concentrated his career on producing music for films and television. His music and sound design has been heard on just about every TV channel on the planet as well as quite a few motion pictures and video games like the BAFTA award-winning \\"Bad Mutha Truckers 2\\" from Empire Interactive. Over 200 of his musical compositions have been featured in films, TV shows and video games. But Alan quickly came to realize that people enjoyed his soundtracks so much that his songs started to get 'bootlegged', copied and shared on the internet. He started getting a 'fan base' even though he had not released an actual album or single in ten years.  Album releases In 2007 Alan decided to once again 'step into the limelight'. He formed his own record label, Slim Chance Recordings and released his third album ‚ÄòSlim Chance and the Groove Enigma‚Äô on that label. With the advent of iTunes and digital online distribution, Alan found that the timing was right for this venture. The single \\"Give it Up\\" from the \\"Slim Chance and the Groove Enigma\\" album was well received in the danceclubs and received worldwide airplay. In 2008, Alan's fourth album, \\"The Jazz Masters\\" was released. A slight departure from Alan's trademark world- fusion electronica sound, the Jazz fusion album \\"The Jazz Masters\\" showcases the more jazzy side of Alan Steward, the kind of music he usually writes for movie and TV soundtracks. The album turned out to be his most successful album to date, being very popular on Smooth jazz radio stations in Europe. Alan's major release for 2008 however was the album \\"Pop Icon\\". \\"Pop Icon\\" showed off Alan's talent as the master of the funky grooves. The single off the album was \\"Underdog\\" which Alan calls an ‚Äòanthem for the anti-heroes‚Äô. \\"Underdog\\" is dedicated to all the independent musicians pursuing their dreams. \\"Pop Icon\\" also featured the vocal talents of Caribbean Soul Vocalist Tricia Hamilton on \\"Bad Boy Style\\" and UK House Diva Diane Gordon on a track called \\"Pfunked Up\\", a tribute to George Clinton and P-Funk. Alan's 2009 album release is entitled \\"Licensed to Chill\\". This World fusion music album features vocals in five different languages and dialects and a great mix of exotic sounds and grooves ranging from 'jazzy' and 'esoteric' to 'very danceable\\" In 2011, he released the album \\"\\"The Temple of Boom\\"\\", similar in style to \\"\\"Licensed to Chill\\"\\", this album also features a variety of musical styles and exotic voices but also a forays into electronic dance, reggae and drum and bass. The album also features a new version of his song \\"Dream come true\\" from the Slim Chance album. The 2013 album release \\"The very best of Alan Steward\\" features 21 songs in total from his last 5 album releases. In 2018, the long-awaited album \\"Rise Up\\" is released. On this album that features mainly Reggae music, Alan takes a very different musical direction. This is also Alan's first album that features Alan's vocals on every single track.

For background see Russian‚ÄìManchu border conflicts. 1653: After Yerofey Khabarov‚Äôs arrest and departure to Moscow in the fall of 1653, Onufriy Stepanov was appointed his deputy in the region of Dauria (upper reaches of the Amur River) and put in charge of the 320 men who remained there. Stepanov and his men suffered privations without enough grain and timber, so they decided to sail down the Amur River beyond the Sungari River to the Ducher country in order to procure food and building materials. Stepanov succeeded in his mission, but not without skirmishes with the Duchers, exacting a considerable yasak from them. Here he built winter quarters. 1654: In the summer of 1654, Stepanov sailed back to the Sungari River to find grain and was joined by another band of 50 cossacks. After sailing up the Sungari for three days he met a Manchu army under the command of Mingandali. (according to Stepanov, it consisted of 3,000 Chinese and Manchus, not including the Duchers and Daurs). A river battle ensued, and Stepanov and his men came off victorious, but the remaining Manchu forces went ashore and entrenched themselves. The Cossacks made an attempt to besiege the trenches, but sustained losses and had to retreat downriver where they were joined by 30 men under sotnik Beketov. He retreated up the Amur, past the Zeya to the mouth of the Kamora River, and wintered at the half-ruined Kamora fortress (–ö–∞–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≥). 1655: Fearing attack, Stepanov began rebuilding the desolate settlement and its fortifications. These precautions paid off, when a Manchurian army of 10,000 soldiers led by Mingandali besieged the Kamora fortress on March 13, 1655. The outnumbered defenders repulsed several assaults, but the Manchus ran short of food and lifted the siege the on April 3, 1655 after destroying the Russian boats. 1655-58: After this incident Stepanov ordered a few of his men to travel to Moscow and deliver the yasak, collected during his stay in the Amur region. Meanwhile, fifty Tomsk Cossacks led by a boyar son Fyodor Pushchin (who had been fighting the Tungus at the mouth of the Argun River) joined Onufriy Stepanov. Once again, Stepanov headed towards the grain-rich region of the Sungari River. After having refreshed his supplies, Stepanov and his men made their way to the Gilyak country on the lower Amur. There, the Cossacks built a fort and collected a yasak consisting of sable, red and silver fox fur. Meanwhile, the living conditions along the Amur River grew worse from year to year because most of the native population had been impoverished by the Cossacks‚Äô exactions and had left the area. Also, Stepanov found out that the Daurs and Duchers had been resettled by the order of their Shunzhi Emperor from the Amur River to the Kurga River. Thus, the Amur region became almost completely deserted, the shores of the Sungari River in particular. An increasing number of outlaws in the area would prey on both the natives and the legal Cossacks. Stepanov and his men would often encounter uluses, sacked and burnt down by robbers. The Cossacks found themselves in a critical situation, especially considering the fact that they lacked manpower to fight their way to more fertile lands. To avoid death from starvation, Stepanov‚Äôs men had to plough and scatter the fields with seeds themselves. It was pointless to remain in this region any longer, so Onufriy Stepanov waited for an opportunity to leave. On July 22, 1656, he dispatched a group of fifty Cossacks to Moscow to deliver a new yasak, providing them with a letter asking the tsar not to send his men back to him due to the lack of food in the Amur region. In his reply, Alexei Mikhailovich thanked Stepanov and his subordinates for their great service and instructed them to \\"conduct themselves bravely\\". Soon enough, the Cossacks grew completely desperate and began to run away from their leader. Negotiations between Moscow and the Manchus stalled, help was nowhere in sight, and natives‚Äô animosity towards the Cossacks grew stronger every day. 1658: Stepanov began preparations for an advance towards a region with a more favorable and friendly environment. On June 30, 1658, below the mouth of the Sungari, Stepanov's 11-boat fleet with 500 Cossacks aboard was surrounded by 40 (or 45, or 45-47Mancall, page 28) boats of the Qing general Sarhuda, with some 1400 Manchu and Korean soldiers aboard, armed with cannons and harquebuses.A.M.

Stepanov was either killed during the fight or drowned while trying to cross the Amur River. The Manchus captured the Russian's yasak and released over a hundred Ducher women kept by the Cossacks on their boats. –î–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –°–∏–Ω –ù—é 1658 –≥ - –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –∫–æ—Ä–µ–π—Ü–µ–≤ (General Shin Ryu's 1659 diary, the first written account of a meeting between Russians and Koreans) 270 Russians were lost and 222 escaped, of whom 180 formed themselves into outlaw bands that lived by raiding the natives in the Zeya area until they were largely wiped out by the Manchus in 1660. Such a tragic finale of the Stepanov party discouraged the Russian leaders from collecting yasak from the natives of the Amur region and made them abandon its official conquest for the next 15 or so years. A number of cossacks continued to live and raid in the area unofficially.

Hammerfight, previously known as Hammerfall, is a 2-dimensional physics-based video game published by Kranx Productions and 1C for Windows in 2009. It was re-released as a cross-platform game in the third Humble Indie Bundle in 2011, at which time the underlying engine, Haaf's Game Engine was made cross-platform and open-sourced.HGE-comes-to-Mac-and-Linux-guest-post-from-Ryan-Gordon on wolfire.com (August 2011)  Plot  The player is a member of a tribe called the Gaiars, a strong race who have battled with large bugs to survive. When the player's tribe is destroyed, he is taken prisoner and turned into a slave. As the player is discovered to be the last living human Gaiar, he is forced to battle in the arena. In battle, a man recognizes the player as the son of a friend, and together they plot the downfall of the Emperor who ordered the destruction of the Gaiars.  Gameplay  In the physics-based gameplay, the player swings large melee weapons and relies on centripetal force to give the object enough kinetic energy to destroy enemies. The demo release had six main types of weapons - four melee and two ranged. The different weapon types offer a certain variety. To be a slow, but well-armored powerhouse using hammers or maces to deliver slow, but crushing blows, or a nimble, but poorly protected sword-wielder, delivering quick, but weak attacks, is entirely up to the player. The game also contains a few different play modes, such as a hunt on worms or a Hammerball game. The equipped weapon is connected to the player's hovering vehicle, and has physically realistic inertia. By moving the vehicle in circles, it is possible to swing the weapon in circles. Keeping the weapon spinning, getting it to solidly connect with foes, and avoiding their own weapons and other threats is one of the main challenges of the game. Weapon type must also be taken into consideration, with blades more effective against unarmored crafts, and heavier blunt weapons causing more damage to armor. Two weapons can be used simultaneously, and a player can experiment with different weights and types to find a pair of weapons that complement each other, or the player's play style. Development The game was developed by Konstantin Koshutin in 2009. The game was initially released by Kranx Productions and 1C for Windows only. Humble Indie bundle re-release In 2011 the game became part of the successful third Humble Indie Bundle. = Haaf's Game Engine: open-sourced = For the bundle, Ryan C.

Plot About a month after the events in the previous book, CIA Director Thomas Stansfield has succumbed to cancer and has chosen Dr. Irene Kennedy, The director of the CIA's counterterrorism center, to take his place as director. Meanwhile, Henry \\"Hank\\" Clark, a corrupt Republican senator and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is making plans to prevent Kennedy from becoming the director of the CIA. His plan involves embarrassing her before she can be confirmed for the position, and handpick a new director and have them open up \\"ECHELON\\", a global surveillance program, and give its secrets to his investors in Silicon Valley, who will then help him get elected to become president. His original plan to kill rapp and embarrass the CIA failed, so he begins the process of his new plan. Mitch Rapp is called in to visit Kennedy to talk about Peter Cameron, the CIA officer who attempted to have him killed in Germany, but was killed by an assassin before Rapp could capture him. He and Kennedy watch surveillance footage that captured the face of the assassin. Rapp realizes that the assassin is Donatella Rahn, an Israeli assassin and Rapp's ex-girlfriend. Kennedy instructs him to take his girlfriend, Anna Rielley, to Milan and propose to her, and then go visit Donatella to learn who hired her to kill Peter Cameron. Meanwhile, Clark visits his accomplice, Mossad director Ben Freidman at the Israeli Embassy, who has been helping him become president in exchange for more aid to Israel. At the meeting, Clark orders Ben to assassinate Donatella, who he hired to kill Peter. Later that day, Ben visits President Xavier Hayes, Kennedy, and General Flood, the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of staff, at the White House. It is there he informs them that Saddam Hussein, with the help of North Korea, is only a few weeks away from acquiring three functioning nuclear weapons. He also informs them that the facility for making these weapons is hidden under a massive hospital in Baghdad, and that if the Americans won't take action, than they will do it themselves. Seeing as how an Israeli response could lead to nuclear war, The President and his team start to come up with ways to destroy the facility and the nukes. At the same time, Mitch and Anna arrive in Milan, and after a day of touring the city, Rapp goes to visit Donatella. In Washington, Clark persuades his accomplice, Albert Rudin, Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to investigate Kennedy for corruption and promises him evidence before her confirmation ceremony. In Milan, Rapp can't get Donatella to tell him who hired her, but realizes they are being followed. When they arrive at her apartment, Donatella is ambushed by awaiting Mossad operatives, but manages to kill them thanks to Rapp's warning. After Rapp promises her protection in America, Donatella confesses that Ben had hired her to kill Peter. Rapp brings Donatella to he and Anna's hotel room, where she accuses Rapp of having an affair,and she storms off before he can explain. In Washington, D.C., General Flood concocts a plan to insert a Delta Force team into Baghdad, disguised as a presidential motorcade, and infiltrate the facility under the cover of a U.S bombing campaign across Iraq in order to steal the nukes. But Kennedy strongly recommends Rapp to lead the operation. Elsewhere in Washington, Jonathan Brown, deputy director of the CIA, meets with Norb Steveken, the head of an investigative firm hired by hank and Rudin to investigate Kennedy. Brown hands off classified information on Orion Team, a secret counterterrorism team led by Kennedy, who Rapp is a member of. Rapp returns to America and is read in on the plan to infiltrate Baghdad. He agrees to the mission and comes up with the idea of impersonating Uday Hussein, Saddam's favorite son, in order to gain access to the facility. As they prepare for the mission, Rudin reveals the existence of Mitch Rapp and the Orion Team on Meet The press and implicates Kennedy of violating international law, throwing the confirmation process into chaos. President Hayes orders the bombing campaign against Iraq, which helps Rapp and the Delta team to successfully enters Baghdad. Rapp and the Delta team, disguised as SRG soldiers, are able to enter the facility and steal the nukes. As they fend off enemy fire, they destroy the facility, kidnap the head North Korean scientist, and escape Iraq with the nukes. After they return to the U.S safely, President Hayes reveals the success of the operation and confirms Rapp's existence by explaining Rapp's action in Iraq. Rapp returns to his home and apologizes to Anna, and after he does this, he retires from his role as an assassin and proposes to her. His plan having failed due to the fact Kennedy is looked at as a hero, Clark kills Rudin by pushing him off his balcony, making it look like a suicide. When the Israeli prime minister comes to Washington with Ben Freidman and Yasser Arafat, Rapp and the president interrogate Ben and threaten to kill him. As a result of this, Ben reveals Clarks role in the weeks events. Several weeks after this, Clark is killed by Rapp and Donatella at a bar in D.C, making it look like an apparent heart attack. 2001 American novels Novels by Vince Flynn Political thriller novels American political novels American thriller novels ","title":"Separation of Power (novel)"},{"id":"21123871","text":"Palisades High School is a public high school in Kintnersville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States.

It consists of an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain, composed primarily of clay rather than rock, leaving tall spires. It is similar to another zone of La Paz that is known as El Valle de las Animas (The Valley of the Souls). It is an important site of the famous holiday, Dias de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating striking optical illusions. A majority of them are a clear beige or light brown color, but some are almost red, with sections of dark violet.

Origins He was born on 21 May 1710, the son of Thomas Thynne (d.1710) by his wife Lady Mary Villiers.Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, (106th edition, 1999), vol. 1, p. 212 His father died a month before Thomas was born. Inheritance Longleat House, which he inherited aged 4; painting by Jan Siberechts, 1675 On 28 July 1714, aged four, on the death of his great uncle Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, he inherited Longleat House and its great estates and succeeded to the baronetcy of Thynne, of Kempsford, Gloucestershire, and (by special remainder) to the titles of Baron Thynne of Warminster, Wiltshire, and Viscount Weymouth, of Dorset. Career In 1733 he was appointed High Steward of Tamworth and was also Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England from 1735 to 1736. Between 4 December 1739 and 1751, he held the royal offices of Keeper of Hyde Park, Keeper of the Mall, and Ranger of St. James's Park, all in the City of Westminster. Shortly after his Hyde Park appointment, he began the construction of the Serpentine Lakes at Longleat, apparently in imitation of Hyde Park's Serpentine.Timothy Mowl, Rococo and Later Landscaping at Longleat (1995) p. 59 Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly on 6 December 1726, to Lady Elizabeth Sackville (d.1729), a daughter of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. Arms of Carteret: Gules, four fusils in fess argent *Secondly he married Lady Louisa Carteret (c.1712-1736), a daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville and a co-heiress of her childless brother Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville (1721‚Äì1776). On her father's side she was a great-grand-daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628-1701), and her father's first-cousin was William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692-1711), on whose death the Earldom of Bath became extinct. The title of Marquess of Bath was later created for her eldest son in 1789 (see below), the title Earl of Bath being then unavailable as it had been recreated for a member of the Pulteney family. When Louisa died in childbirth, in her early twenties, her friend, Mrs Delany, wrote:\\"Her husband's ... loss is irreparable.\\" During her illness, Mrs Delany had written that \\"my Lord Weymouth is like a madman\\". By Louisa Carteret he had two sons: Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath (1734‚Äì1796), eldest son and heir, created Marquess of Bath in 1789. He inherited Longleat House and his father's vast estates. Henry Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (1735‚Äì1826), created Baron Carteret (2nd creation) in 1784. As a second son under the system of primogeniture he had little expectation of a rich inheritance. However, in 1776, by Act of Parliament,The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 96, Part 2, August 1826, p.174, Obituary he changed his name and arms to Carteret, in compliance with his inheritance from his childless uncle Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville, 3rd Baron Carteret (1721‚Äì1776) (under the terms of the will of the latter's father John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 2nd Baron Carteret (1690‚Äì1763),Victoria County History, Bedford, Volume 2, William Page (editor), 1908, pp.338-344, Parishes: Hawnes or Haynes of his estates including Hawnes Park (now Haynes Park), in Bedfordshire and Stowe House, Kilkhampton in Cornwall (the ancient seat of the Granvilles, Earls of Bath). He also succeeded him as Bailiff of Jersey, a post (for life) long held by heads of the Carteret family. In 1784 he was created Baron Carteret, of Hawnes, thus reviving his uncle's second title. Death and burial He died on 12 January 1750/51, at Horningsham, Wiltshire, and was buried there on 22 January.

Zivilarbeiter (German for civilian worker) refers primarily to ethnic Polish residents from the General Government (Nazi- occupied central Poland), used during World War II as forced laborers in the Third Reich. Polish Zivilarbeiters The residents of occupied Poland were conscripted on the basis of the so-called Polish decrees (Polenerlasse), and were subject to discriminatory regulation. Compared to German workers or foreign workers from neutral and German-allied countries (Gastarbeitnehmer), Polish Zivilarbeiters received lower wages and were not allowed to use public conveniences (such as public transport) or visit many public spaces and businesses (for example they were not allowed to attend German church services, visit swimming pools or restaurants); they had to work longer hours than Germans; they received smaller food rations; they were subject to a curfew; they often were denied holidays and had to work seven days a week; could not enter a marriage without permission; possess money or objects of value. Bicycles, cameras and even lighters were forbidden. They were required to wear a sign - the \\"Polish-P\\" - attached to their clothing.

In December 1939, the system also covered those aged 14 to 18, with severe punishments for law breakers. The people who did not work were called by the local authorities, and sent to work in Germany. Since the Third Reich suffered from shortage of workers, as time went by also those Poles who had permanent employment, but were not regarded as necessary for the economy, were sent to Germany. Other methods were also used, such as the infamous roundups, called \\"≈Çapanka\\" in Poland. Those who did not present a certificate of employment were automatically sent to Germany. Most Polish Zivilarbeiters worked in agriculture, forestry, gardening, fishing, also in transport and industry. Some were employed as housekeepers. None signed any contracts, and their working hours were determined by the employers.

Its products included diesel engines, small locomotives (shunters) and other railway locomotive parts. Much of its business came through the German railways, though it also exported to the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. From 2004 onwards the company was split into two separate concerns - Gmeinder Lokomotivenfabrik which manufactures locomotives and Gmeinder Getriebe- und Maschinenfabrik which makes components - specifically railway axle gearboxes. HistoryHistory of Gmiender (company site) In 1913 The company Steinmetz Gmeinder KG was founded in Mosbach by Anton Gmeinder and August Steinmetz, six years later the company name was changed to \\"A. Gmeinder & Cie.\\". The same year a locomotive with a petrol engine was made. In 1925 another change of identity occurred - with the organisation becoming Gmeinder & Co. GmbH with Anton Gmeinder and Carl and Hermann Kaelble as co-partners. In 1964 with financial support from the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Gmeider built a small series of narrow-gauge diesel locomotives of gauge series V 51 and gauge V 52 for the Bundesbahn to replace the outdated steam engines that were still in use. Its locomotive factory was one of the major manufacturers of small and medium-sized diesel engines as well as producing small locomotives. Although Deutsche Bundesbahn was a major customer many of the industrial locomotives it produced were sold to private companies and exported around the world. In 1976 merged with the truck manufacturer Carl Kaelble GmbH from Backnang. Due to the truck manufacturer's large contract with Libya and as a result of a trade embargo with that country it became bankrupt in 1996. From the ruins of that company Gmeider re-emerged again as a locomotive manufacturer Gmeinder Getriebe- und Lokomotivenfabrik GmbH completely split from Kaeble. Kaeble became a construction machinery manufacturer and now is part of the Terex corporation. In 2003 the sale of the locomotive section of Gmeinder Getriebe- und Lokomotivenfabrik GmbH brings about the existence of two separate companies named 'Gmeider' : they are Gmeinder Lokomotivenfabrik and Gmeinder Getriebe- und Maschinenfabrik =Gmeinder Lokomotivenfabrik= In March 2008 at the station of Neckarbischofsheim a new factory was brought into operation in which locomotives are upgraded or repaired, the Krebsbach valley railway is used for test runs.

He is most known for his role as GraveRobber in Repo! The Genetic Opera, as Lucifer in The Devil's Carnival films, and Mister Tender in American Murder Song.  Early career  After graduating from Otis College of Art & Design in 1998, Zdunich took a job at Sony Animation drawing storyboards on such animated television shows as Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles and Max Steel. Creatively frustrated, he left animation in 2002 to pursue freelance illustration gigs, including work on Fox‚Äôs television series Bones. As a storyboard artist he worked on live-action films such as What We Do Is Secret about the punk band the Germs, and Into The Wild, directed by Sean Penn. He also worked part-time teaching drawing and painting in Calabasas, California. While transitioning from studio work in animation to life as a freelance artist, Terrance enrolled in an acting class at the South Coast Repertory Theatre where he met future collaborator Darren Smith. Together, in 1999 they formed \\"The Gallery\\" and the two began writing and performing theatrical rock music in the form of ten- minute operas. As a duo they played the Los Angeles club/theatre scene. Due to the positive response to their first ten-minute opera, The Necro-merchant's Debt, they decided to expand the piece into a full-length theatrical format which was later renamed Repo! The Genetic Opera.  Career  In 2001, Zdunich and Smith assembled a small group of actors and musicians and began performing Repo as a one-act set at clubs in Los Angeles, California. In 2002, Repo: The Genetic Opera received its first full-length staging in Hollywood, California at the John Raitt Theatre with Darren Lynn Bousman directing.Repo! The Genetic Opera on MovieSet.com The original engagement also featured Zdunich in the role as the narrator \\"GraveRobber.\\" ‚ÄòRepo‚Äô was remounted again in 2004 at West Hollywood‚Äôs SplitID Theatre, and finally, for the last time, it was seen on stage in 2005 at the Off-Off Broadway Wings Theatre in NYC with Zdunich both acting and directing. Zdunich, Bousman and Smith put together a ten-minute short film of Repo starring Zdunich, Shawnee Smith, Michael Rooker & J LaRose in 2006 .2006 Repo Short on IMDB The short film was screened for agents and producers at Endeavor Agency in Beverly Hills, CA. Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures eventually brought Repo to the big screen in 2008, which starred Anthony Head, Alexa Vega, Paul Sorvino, and Sarah Brightman.Repo! The Genetic Opera Zdunich maintained his acting role as \\"GraveRobber\\" and assumed new roles as well, which included drawing the film‚Äôs animated sequencesIMDB Repo Cast and Crew and becoming an associate producer. Despite the film's limited theatrical release to 11 theaters in America, Repo has gained an international cult fan base and was ranked amongst the top 25 cult movies of all time by a Rolling Stone readers' pollhttps://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/readers-poll-the-25-best- cult-movies-of-all-time-20140507/22-repo-the-genetic-opera-0104637 Zdunich still regularly travels the US attending \\"shadowcast\\" performances of Repo at conventions and private events. In 2009, in an effort to return to his drawing roots, Zdunich began work on a solo project, a comic book series dubbed The Molting. The Molting, which is being published independently, is expected to be released in 12 parts. Zdunich wrote the story arc in its entirety before a single page was drawn. He releases a new issue every few months, drawing the frames himself. He completes the work with the help of letterer Oceano Ransford and colorists Brian Johnson & Molly Rodman. Zdunich admits the series is in part based on his real life experiences growing up in Southern California. He also catalogs his artistic process in a blog series entitled \\"Molting with the Molting.\\" As of October 2012, seven chapters have been published: Guilty Susie, The Happiest Place on Earth, Ootheca, Lethal Raids, Mother‚Äôs Day, Allied Forces and Supernatural Aid.http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37615/chapter-7-of-the-molting- supernatural-aid-coming-in-october/ On May 28, 2010, at the Sacramento Horror Film Festival, Terrance debuted the first in a series of weekly online instructional videos, a project entitled The Tutor, described as a \\"Bob Ross meets Ted Bundy\\" school of art. As The Tutor, Terrance taught viewers how to paint a still life. The Tutor encouraged audience participation through \\"homework\\"‚Äì video and still art assignments provided in The Tutor‚Äôs accompanying blog. On Saturday, October 23, 2010, The Tutor project concluded in an event held in Hollywood, California called The Tutor‚Äôs Gallery. The event included a live performance by Zdunich and an art show of the work created by his students. In 2012 Zdunich and Bousman, along with composer Saar Hendelman, released The Devil's Carnival, a 56-minute independent film designed to challenge conventional distribution models.http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2012/08/17/how-the-creators-of- the-devils-carnival-said-screw-you-to-hollywood-and-gained-a-cult-following The film featuring stars from film and television, like Sean Patrick Flanery and Dayton Callie, as well as rock stars Emilie Autumn and Ivan Moody.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204379/ During the initial release The Devil‚Äôs Carnival was only shown at exclusive one night engagements in 60 cities across the U.S. and Canada.http://renegadecinema.com/1282/terrance- zdunich-interview The road tour broke with the normal film viewing experience by including meet and greets with the cast, Q&As;, costume contests, live sideshow acts and behind the scenes footage.http://www.joblo.com/horror- movies/news/the-devils-carnival-prepares-for-its-road-tour-with-this-new- trailer Due to the success of the first film and road tour Zdunich reprised his role as Lucifer in 2015 Alleluia!

H. Holmes at the 1893 world‚Äôs fair.  Themes  Followers of Zdunich will notice recurring ideas in his projects. He regularly attests to his love of the macabre and produces work normally dubbed \\"horror.\\" From his earliest pieces, such as the illustrated God & the Box (seen on his website), his work has always prominently featured bugs, especially cockroaches. His website boasts flash representations of the critters with factoids about the animals and he maintains pet roaches as a hobby. His fondness for the creatures, he says, comes from their generally misunderstood nature and their tenacity- characteristics he identifies with.

Charles Pierrepont Henry Gilbert (August 29, 1861 in New York City ‚Äì October 25, 1952), most often referred to as C. P. H. Gilbert,He was also sometimes referred to as \\"Charles Pierrepont H. Gilbert\\", as in his New York Times obituary. was an American architect of the late-19th and early-20th centuries best known for designing townhouses and mansions.  Background and early life Gilbert's family comes of English and New English ancestry. One of the members was Sir Humphrey Gilbert, to whom Queen Elizabeth I of England granted a patent for the colonization of North America. Sir Humphrey's ambitious plans ended when he was lost at sea with most of his company on his return voyage from the exploration of Newfoundland. Other members of the family, however, soon planted the name in North America. His father was Loring Gilbert, a direct descendant of John Gilbert, the second son of Giles Gilbert of Bridgwater, Somerset, England, who came to America early in the 17th century and settled at Dorchester, near Boston, and died at Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1654. Loring Gilbert was a leading commission merchant who had a successful career. He married Caroline C. Etchebery, and they had one son, Charles Pierrepont Henry Gilbert. Loring Gilbert died in 1893. C. P. H. Gilbert received a careful education, studying both in America and in Europe, such as the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. After being prepared for college he took special courses in civil engineering and architecture, and later studied painting, sculpture and the fine arts in general. After college, he began practical work as an assistant in the office of a prominent firm of architects, where he received the training necessary to prepare him for engaging in his own business. As a young man he designed buildings in the mining towns of Colorado and Arizona before returning to New York around 1885.  Career  In 1886, at the age of twenty-five, Gilbert began practicing as an architect in New York City, and received commission to design buildings of all kinds. One of Gilbert's first projects was the design of fourteen brownstone rowhouses that now form a part of the Manhattan Avenue Historic District. Gilbert designed the block for Hoboken developer John Brown in 1886.Postal, Matthew A.; Most, Jennifer L. et al. \\"Manhattan Avenue Historic District Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (May 17, 2007) Another noteworthy building was the 1888 Richardsonian Romanesque mansion at Eighth Avenue and Carroll Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn for Thomas Adams Jr., a chewing gum magnate. From 1893 on, Gilbert had a very large business, which grew steadily. In addition, he was a director or a stockholder in a number of large manufacturing companies outside of New York. He saw action during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. After the war he returned to New York. By 1900 Gilbert had a reputation as a specialist in designing opulent townhouses and mansions. Among Gilbert's Fifth Avenue palazzi is the 1905 Neo-Renaissance mansion of Morton Freeman Plant, son of railroad tycoon Henry B. Plant. Through the 1920s he designed more than 100 New York City mansions in various styles; several of them along Fifth Avenue have now been re-purposed for institutional use. In education, client list and architectural style, Gilbert largely followed in the footsteps of Richard Morris Hunt, whose petit ch√¢teau on Fifth Avenue for William Kissam Vanderbilt set a model for French Late Gothic limestone ch√¢teaux to house the elite of the Gilded Age.Craven, Wayne. Gilded Mansions: Grand Architecture and High Society (2008) p. 310. Amongst Gilbert's clients were wealthy and influential industrialists and bankers such as Harry F. Sinclair, Joseph Raphael De Lamar, Felix M. Warburg, Otto H. Kahn, Adolph Lewisohn, Augustus G. Paine, Jr. and families such as the Baches, Reids, Wertheims, Sloanes and other. Gilbert also designed a number of mansions and buildings on Long Island and in upstate New York in the 1920s. Gilbert retreated from public life, and by the late 1920s stopped designing any new houses. He retired to Pelham Manor, New York in Westchester County, where he died on October 25, 1952 at his home on 216 Townsend Avenue, at the age of 92.Pearson, Marjorie. \\"Gilbert, C(harles) P(ierrepont) H.\\" in , p.467Hasbrouk, Charles et al. \\"West End Collegiate Historical District Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (January 3, 1984), pp.256-257 He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.  Memberships  Gilbert was a member of numerous professional and social organizations, amongst them the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, the Architectural League, the Society of Colonial Wars, the General Society of the Sons of the Revolution, the New England Society, and the Fine Arts, Metropolitan, Union League, Lawyers', Riding, Racquet, Ardsley, Colonial, Country, and Nassau Country clubs of New York. He also was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and a veteran of Squadron A, the cavalry organization of the New York National Guard.  Family  Gilbert was married to Florence Cecil Moss, daughter of Theodore Moss of New York City, and had two children: Dudley Pierrepont Gilbert and Vera Pierrepont Gilbert. He lived at 33 Riverside Drive and had a villa in Newport, Rhode Island at Ochre Point.  Works  Some of Gilbert's works include: *1881 - Jules S.

He was especially noted for his writing about the history of his home town of Berkhamsted in West Hertfordshire. His publications include A History of Berkhamsted and Bygone Berkhamsted, both published by Clunberry. Life and career Birtchnell was born in Highfield Road, Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire in 1910. After working as a typesetter at Cooper‚Äôs printing works (later the Clunbury Press), he opened a menswear shop in the parade of shops next to the newly built Rex Cinema. He was one of the founders of the Berkhamsted & District Local History Society in 1950. His menswear shop later moved west along the High Street to new premises. From an early age, Birtchnell developed an interest in history, especially local history, and began writing articles for local papers when he was aged fifteen. He had articles published in the Berkhamsted Gazette and the Watford Observer. He also contributed historical articles to the Berkhamsted Review, a local parish magazine, writing under the pen name Beorcham, which was an archaic name for Berkhamsted.

He supported the Soviet Ukrainization during the 1920s which probably led to his arrest and execution during the Great Purge in the 1930s. Early life After studies at a rural school in the big village of Kamianske, Yekaterinoslav Governorate (pop. ~20,000), he started to work at a railway workshop office. He was fired from his job in 1918 after he had taken part in anti-Hetmanate actions. In 1919, he joined the staff of the first volunteer Moscow regiment and took part in revolutionary events. In early 1920, he joined the Bolshevik party and the Revolutionary committee in Kamianske. He later moved to Poltava where he worked as a political instructor, secretary and chairman of a regional board. During the period of 1922‚Äì1924, Epik worked within the regional board of the Ukrainian branch of Komsomol and. from 1924 to 1925, as an editor of Chervonyi shliakh (Red Road) in Kharkiv.Biblioteka Ukra√Ønsko√Ø Literatury Between 1925 and 1929, he studied in the department of Ukrainian history at the Kharkiv Institute of Red Professors. After graduating, he became the director of the Derzhlitvydav publishing house (State Publishing House). Writings Epik's writings started to appear in print in 1923. He was a member of several Ukrainian literary organizations such as the Pluh, Prolitfront and VAPLITE (Free Academy of Proletarian Literature). These organizations gathered many young members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, who in the 1930s suffered severely during the Great Purge. In Epik's prose from the 1920s, he sharply criticized different aspects of the Soviet regime, particularly in Bez gruntu, 1928. His last novels from the 1930s, however, were written in the Stalinist spirit. During the late 1920s, Epik also was a screenwriter for the growing Ukrainian film industry. Repression and death Even though Epik had continued to support the Communist Party, after the abrupt reversion of the Soviet Ukrainization in the early 1930s, he suffered from the purges. He was arrested on 5 December 1934, accused of being a Ukrainian nationalist and a member of a secret terrorist organization. In early 1935, he was sentenced to ten years of forced labour and sent to the Solovki prison camp in the White Sea. While on Solovki, he continued to write and even sent one of his works, Solovki stories, to the NKVD in Moscow. He was, afterwards, disappointed and stopped writing. Epik was one of the \\"lost transport\\" of prisoners shipped back to the mainland in 1937 from Solovki. It is now known that he was shot on 3 November 1937 at the killing field and burial ground called Sandarmokh near Medvezhyegorsk, in Karelia (then the Karelian ASSR), a site discovered in 1997 by the Memorial Society and its local head Yury A. Dmitriev. Together with Epik 289 other members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia‚Äîsuch as Mykola Kulish, Valerian Pidmohylnyi, Yulian Shpol, Valerian Polishuk, Les Kurbas, Myroslav Irchan, and Mykola Zerov‚Äîwere shot at Sandarmokh. Epik was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956 by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR.

It is the second known sonnet sequence by a woman writer in England (the first was by Anne Locke). The poems are strongly influenced by the sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella (1580) penned by her uncle Sir Philip Sidney. Like Sidney's sequence, Wroth's sonnets passed among her friends and acquaintances in manuscript form before they were published in 1621.An exhibition at the Folger Shakespeare Library, including Lady Mary Wroth's Manuscripts In Wroth's sequence, she upends Petrarchan tropes by making the unattainable object of love male (as opposed to female). Composition Wroth began writing sonnets for the sequence as early as 1613, when the poet Josuah Sylvester referred to her poetry in his Lachrimae Lachrimarum.Roberts, Josephine A.. 1982. \\"The Biographical Problem of Pamphilia to Amphilanthus\\". Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature 1 (1). University of Tulsa: 43‚Äì53. doi:10.2307/464091. She composed, in total, 105 sonnets.Bolam, Robyn, \\"The Heart of the Labyrinth: Mary Wroth's Pamphilia to Amphilanthus\\", in New Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture, ed. Michael Hattaway (Singapore: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 289. Versions Parts of the sequence appear in four versions: in the 1621 The Countess of Montgomeries Urania, the manuscript continuation of Urania, and Wroth's holograph manuscript held at the Folger Shakespeare Library. Nineteen sonnets are spread throughout the prose of the 1621 Urania, and eighty-three are printed in sequence at the back of the same volume. Three sonnets appear in the manuscript continuation of Urania. The holograph manuscript is the most comprehensive collection of the sequence. Five sonnets and one song in the Folger manuscript were not printed in the 1621 volume, while the fourth sonnet in the published sequence does not appear in the manuscript. Dramatic differences between versions consist of changes to punctuation in the 1621 version from that which appears in the manuscript; these changes were probably completed by Urania's printer Augustine Matthews.Bolam 289-290. Content The sonnet sequence is organized in four sections. In the first, fifty-five- poem section, Pamphilia determines her true feelings about her unfaithful lover, toward whom she is ambivalent throughout this section, though she affirms her choice to love Amphilanthus by its end. After a series of songs, the next section, of ten poems, takes on a darker tone as Pamphilia confronts doubt and jealously, but the end of the sequence finds her seeking forgiveness from Cupid, the god of love, to whom she promises a crown of sonnets as penance for her doubt. The crown's fourteen sonnets form the sequence's third section. The final eight sonnets in the sequence comprise the fourth section, in which Pamphilia returns to a darker, melancholy tone, but understands that her suffering is necessary in order to understand the inner world of human emotion.Roberts 50-51.  Sonnet 7  The seventh sonnet in Pamphilia to Amphilanthus supports Wroth's overarching themes of a woman's struggle in 17th century English society. The sonnet introduces female struggle between coercion and consent to a male lover. Bernadette Andrea's \\"Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania\\" addresses the reasons why a female character would confront the reality of choosing between coercion and consent. One of the main aspects that Andrea approaches is the limits that the historical context put on the author's freedom of speech. Andrea states, \\"She may write, but only from the limits of her own room; she may preserve her writing, but only within the confines of her own mind\\".Andrea, Bernadette. Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, pp. 335, http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/v068/68.2andrea.html Sonnet 7 is Pamphilia's expression of her own thoughts, emotions and views. The seventh sonnet, from the only extant Pamphilia manuscript in Wroth's own hand.This manuscript is a part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library, V.a.104 The power of the patriarchal society on her views is evident. The influence is exemplified in line 6, \\"I am thy subject, conquered, bound to stand\\". Voicing her situation, Pamphilia feels subjected to male dominance. However, her desires are unclear on this matter because she says, \\"behold I yield\\", (5) as if a declaration of her choice to the relations with Amphilanthus. The idea of free choice for women would be classified as a protofeminist thought because they were grossly oppressed and not allowed to think for themselves. [The following is a misapplication of Mullaney's ideas; or rather, the writer needs to explain how Wroth's work is akin to the ideological functions of the theater which are the actual subject of Mullaney's work]: Stephen Mullaney provides insight into the reason that Mary Wroth's work survived by stating, \\"What comes to reside in a wonder-cabinet are, in the most reified sense of the phrase, strange things: tokens of alien cultures, reduced to the status of sheer objects, stripped of cultural and human contexts in a way that makes them eminently capable of surviving the period that thus produced them\\".Steven Mullaney, \\"Strange Things, Gross Terms, Curious Customs: The Rehearsal of Cultures in the Late Renaissance\\", in Representing the English Renaissance, ed. Stephen Greenblatt (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1988, 68. This essay was first published in 1983 and was subsequently included as chap. 3 in Mullaney's extended study of The Place of the Stage: License, Play, and Power in Renaissance England.Mullaney, Steven. The Place of the Stage: License, Play and Power in Renaissance England. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1988 The social analysis of the survival of the oppressed writings comes from \\"Strange Things, Gross Terms, Curious Customs\\". The treatment of women caused Pamphilia to question whether she even has a choice in who she loves (consent) or if that is determined by society (coercion). Her inability to differentiate in the poem is probably due to the subjugation of inferior treatment that she has experienced. Mullaney refers to this as being \\"reduced to the status of sheer objects\\".Mullaney, 68 She is forced to analyze if she is merely an object at the disposal of men. As a result, her ability to analyze, invoke higher level thinking, and even her personhood is examined. Wroth's representation of female emotions conjured with the interaction with of a male suitor puts expected women's values into action. The sonnet explores the \\"obedience\\" attribute of what Bernadette Andrea refers to as the \\"triple injunction\\" of English culture in the 17th century.Andrea,335 The \\"triple injunction\\" concept was communicated through many different forms including: educational tracts, religious sermons, and legal codes. Its purpose was to define the perfect woman as upholding social norms through the values of chastity, obedience, and silence.Andrea,335 Pamphilia ends the sonnet resolving to \\"obey\\" (14) Amphilanthus' \\"charms\\", (14) regardless of her own wants. Her conclusion to persevere despite her personal feelings speaks to the cultural understanding of women heroism which is equated with endurance.Andrea, 335 Pamphilia does not concede all hope of having a choice in the relationship, but does wish to avoid physical hurt.\\"for pain refuse\\" (12) The sonnet does make an intriguing reference to Astrophel and Stella: in line 13 of the Petrarchan sonnet, Wroth writes, \\"‚Ä¶Sir God, your boyship I despise\\". The phrase \\"Sir God\\" is linked to the late 16th century poem, Astrophel and Stella.Grosart, Alexander. The Complete Poems of Sir Philip Sidney. Oregon: University of Oregon, December 1995. . Sidney's Astrophel is referred to as \\"Sir Foole\\".Grosart 1 According to Catherine Bates, Astrophel contracts similar difficulty as he, \\"is not only overmastered, the willing victim of a superior power, he is also emasculated\\".Bates, Catherine. \\"Astrophil and the Manic Wit of the Abject Male\\". SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900. Vol. 41, Num. 1, Winter 2001, pp. 1. Perpetuating the gender roles of the time, Bates argues that Sidney paints Astrophel, a boy, as feminine.Bates, 1 Wroth includes traces of Astrophel and Stella to provide ties to previous gender inequality. Astrophel only experiences the struggle between coercion, \\"overmastered\\", and consent, \\"willing\\", because he is cast as feminine.Bates, 1 Bates's understanding of downward mobility in social status by moving from male to female through Sydney's Astrophel and Stella is strongly supported by Bernadette Andrea's analysis of social norms. Wroth's echo of Sydney's work is to address the gender issues from a new voice: the female perspective.  Sonnet 22  It is suggested that the line \\"Like to the Indians, scorched with the sun\\" recalls Wroth's role in Ben Jonson's Masque of Blackness (1605). This masque was designed by Inigo Jones and written for Queen Anne of Denmark.Lamb, Mary Ellen. \\"Wroth, Lady Mary\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Gary Waller, in his book The Sidney Family Romance, explains that this masque was controversial because Wroth and the other female actors appeared in blackface as the twelve daughters of Niger.Waller, Gary. The Sidney Family Romance: Mary Wroth, William Herbert, and the early modern construction of gender. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993. p. 228 The 22nd sonnet, from the only extant Pamphilia manuscript in Wroth's own hand.This manuscript is a part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library, V.a.104 Anita Hagerman, in her article \\"'But Worth pretends': Discovering Jonsonian Masque in Lady Mary Wroth's Pamphilia to Amphilanthus\\", discusses Wroth's role in Jonson's The Masque of Blackness and the specific influence of the theme of darkness on Sonnet 22. She states that Wroth played a character named Baryte, an Ethiopian maiden. Hagerman suggests that Wroth created a courtly persona for herself in these masques and that the themes of this persona are themes in Pamphilia to Amphilanthus. One idea of Wroth's courtly persona was darkness, probably stemming from her reputation of seriousness. The theme of dark versus light is explored in Sonnet 22 and is representative of her uncertainty of whether she wants her desires for Amphilanthus to be fulfilled or not, because either way will prove \\"torturous\\".Hagerman, Anita. \\"'But Worth pretends': Discovering Jonsonian Masque in Lady Mary Wroth's Pamphilia to Amphilanthus\\". Early Modern Literary Studies 6.3 (January 2001): 4.1-17 The idea of theatricality influences the way this poem is interpreted. Because it is understood that Wroth is talking about her experience in a theatrical performance, the theme of the artificial aspect of the masque performance needs to be taken into account. To understand this sonnet, we must understand how Wroth felt about taking part in courtly masques. Hagerman says that in the way that Pamphilia is ambivalent about what to do with her love for Amphilanthus, Wroth herself is ambivalent about the life of courtly masques. The contradiction of allowing women to have \\"feminine expressive display\\" of feelings and then strictly \\"enforced silence\\" could have represented the good and the bad of courtly life for Wroth. In the masques, Wroth was given a voice, but after she was no longer affiliated with the court life, she recognized the artificiality of the voice she had because the courtly life and the masques require a level of falseness. Gary Waller states that Wroth's female characters describe the pressure they feel in terms of theater and display. For a female to take part in a masque, she is creating the illusion of power because she is entering the space of the court and commanding attention. However, it subjects her to the gaze of men and makes her feel powerless and victimized.Waller, 234 References External links *Wroth's manuscript of Pamphilia to Amphilanthus from the Folger Shakespeare Library Digital Image Collection *Mary Wroth's Poetry: An Electronic Edition, which features a comparative version of the sequence's text * English poems Sonnet studies ","title":"Pamphilia to Amphilanthus"},{"id":"21124421","text":"Tekniska h√∂gskolan is a station on the red line of the Stockholm metro, located in the districts √ñstermalm and Norra Djurg√•rden, near the Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska h√∂gskolan).

First elected in 1986 in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's \\"firestorm\\" that swept through the region, giving Democrats unprecedented control of southwestern Minnesota for the next several election cycles, Beckman served four terms. He was re- elected in 1990, 1992 and 1996. He represented the old District 29 and, later, District 26, which included all or portions of Blue Earth, Faribault, Freeborn, Martin, Waseca and Watonwan counties, changing somewhat through redistricting in 1990. From the small town of Bricelyn, Beckman, a corn processing plant manager, consultant, hardware store owner and former teacher, earned a reputation as a strong advocate for agricultural issues, processing of agricultural products, small business development, rural economic development, job creation, education, crime prevention and health care during his time in office. He is a graduate of Mankato State University and Harvard University. While in the legislature, Beckman was a member of the Senate Agriculture, Crime Prevention, Economic Development and Housing, Education, Employment, Energy and Community Development, Finance, Government Operations and Reform, Jobs, and Veterans committees, and of various sub-committees relevant to each area. Beckman ran for Congress against incumbent Gil Gutknecht in 1998 in Minnesota's old 1st Congressional District. Prior to the current re-districting, the district encompassed most of southeastern Minnesota and was a heavily Republican area. Beckman received 45% of the vote to Gutknecht's 55% in the November general election. In February 1999, Beckman resigned his senate seat after he was appointed Minnesota State Director of the Farm Service Agency, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

In modern times, these muskets are commonly referred to by their date of design followed by the name Springfield (\\"1855 Springfield\\", for example). However, U.S. Ordnance Department documentation at the time did not use \\"Springfield\\" in the name (\\"Rifle Musket, Model 1855\\", for example). They are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"Springfield rifles\\". Rifles have grooves on the inside of their barrels. Smooth bore muskets do not. The term \\"Rifled musket\\" originally referred to smooth bore muskets that later had their barrels rifled. This term was extended to include weapons that were produced with rifled barrels, as long as the overall design was very similar to the original smooth bore musket. Smoothbore muskets: * Model 1795 Musket First longarm to be manufactured at Springfield. * Model 1812 Musket .69-caliber flintlock musket * Model 1816 Musket .69-caliber flintlock musket * Model 1822 Musket .69-caliber flintlock musket * Model 1835 Musket .69-caliber flintlock musket * Model 1840 Musket .69-caliber flintlock (later percussion) musket * Model 1842 Musket .69-caliber percussion musket Rifled musket: * Springfield Model 1855 .58-caliber Rifled Musket * Springfield Model 1861 .58-caliber Rifled Musket * Springfield Model 1863 .58-caliber Rifled Musket Overview: The Springfield Model 1795 was the first musket to be produced in the United States. It was essentially a direct copy of the French Model 1763 Charleville musket, which had been imported in great numbers during the American Revolution. The War of 1812 revealed many weaknesses in both design and manufacturing, which the Model 1812 sought to correct. The Model 1812 borrowed many design features from the French Model 1777 Charleville musket. The Model 1816 standardized all of the changes that had been made during production of the Model 1812. This design was produced for many years with only minor changes, such as the modification to the sling swivel on the Model 1822. The Model 1835 was likewise very similar in design, but was produced using significantly different manufacturing techniques with an emphasis on machine made parts and parts interchangeability. Minor changes were again made for the Model 1840, which culminated in the Model 1842, which was the first musket to be produced with completely interchangeable, machine-made parts. As these muskets were produced with only minor changes, some historians consider the Models 1816 through 1840 to all be minor variants of a single model type. The Model 1840 was the last musket to be produced as a flintlock. Many Model 1840 muskets were converted to percussion lock before they made it to the field. The percussion lock was seen as such an improvement that many earlier muskets (all the way back to the Model 1816) had their flint locks replaced with percussion locks. The 1840s also saw the introduction of the minie ball, which allowed rifled barrels to be used with muzzle-loading black-powder weapons. Model 1840 and 1842 muskets were produced as smoothbore weapons, but many had their barrels rifled after production, causing them to be referred to as rifled muskets. Subsequent models in the series continued to be referred to as rifled muskets, even though they had not been produced as smoothbore weapons originally. The minie ball, being an elongated, conical bullet, has much more mass than a round ball of the same diameter. Springfield muskets until this time had all used .69 caliber rounds, the same as the Charleville musket that the first Springfield muskets had been based on. The U.S. Army began experimenting with smaller diameter rounds, and settled on .58 caliber for use in rifled muskets, as the .58 caliber minie ball had approximately the same mass as a .69 caliber round ball. The .58 caliber minie ball became standard starting with the Springfield Model 1855. The Model 1855 also attempted to improve the overall fire rate of the musket by replacing the percussion lock with the Maynard tape primer. This proved to be unreliable, and the Model 1861 reverted to the original percussion lock. The model 1863 featured only minor improvements to the Model 1861, and is often considered to be a variant of that model. After the U.S. Civil War, many Model 1861/1863 muskets were converted to breech-loading weapons, creating the Model 1865 rifle. After the change from muzzle-loading to breech-loading, these weapons were no longer referred to as rifled muskets and instead were simply referred to as rifles.

After two seasons with the Beavers, where he was stuck playing in a defensive role for Sherbrooke, Roussin was traded to the Rimouski Oc√©anic. It was with Rimouski where Roussin would start producing offensively. He would finish the 2003 with a point per game average, scoring 38 points in 38 games. That would be enough for Roussin to get noticed by the Florida Panthers, who chose to draft Roussin in the 7th round with the 223rd pick of the NHL Entry Draft. The following year, he finished the season leading the QMJHL with 59 goals in 64 games and finishing second to teammate Sidney Crosby in points. In the 2004-05 season, Roussin would put up similar numbers. He would finish 2nd in scoring that season, beating teammate and future Edmonton Oilers 1st round pick Marc-Antoine Pouliot by two points, but finished 52 points behind Sidney Crosby.

Roussin spent most of three seasons shuffling between Los Angeles' ECHL affiliate, the Reading Royals and their American Hockey League affiliate in the Manchester Monarchs.

The genus remained in Sphenacodontidae until the type material was reexamined. In 1986 the type specimen was reassigned to Synapsida incertae sedis by R. R. Reisz, who was unable to identify the relationship of the material to other synapsids. This opinion was reaffirmed by Sullivan and Reisz in 1999. Upon further examination of the specimens, Evans et al. in 2009 reaffirmed the validity of the genus name and placed the genus in the Varanopidae. However they were unable to determine enough distinct characters to maintain the species Thrausmosaurus serratidens, and thus declared the name nomen dubium.

It is a large fieldstone dwelling begun, it is believed, in the 1690s and completed in 1802 on part of a 2500-acre tract named \\"The Valley of Jehosaphat\\" by Richard Smith, Jr., who was granted the land by Lord Baltimore in 1684 in recognition of Smith's service as the first attorney general of Maryland. Smith's descendants owned the tract until Walter Dulany bought half of it in the 1720s and the other half about 20 years later. Etymology While the origin of the name, \\"Eagle's Nest\\", is unknown, one possible explanation has to do with the fact that a Mr. FitzHugh of Virginia married one of famed lawyer Daniel Dulany's sisters and lived with her at \\"Fitzhugh Farm\\", adjoining the original \\"Eagle's Nest\\" to the north. The FitzHughs owned, among other properties, a plantation north of the James River named, \\"Eagle's Nest\\". Dulany Family The Dulany family was a prosperous mercantile and land-owning family with an extensive trading relationship with England. Their loyalties lay with the Mother Country throughout the American Revolution, the outcome of which left them out of favor. The Eagle's Nest was confiscated, and the house with some acreage was sold at a sheriff's sale to Thomas Marsh, the property's overseer who lived in the house as it was then. Since the Marshes were Quakers, they had no interest in owning slaves, instead producing 10 or more children in each generation. Thomas's son, Joshua, served as a captain in the Revolution and afterward became financially successful in his management of raising and selling crops and livestock. It was he who built the main portion of the house a decade and a half after Hampton Mansion was built. A copy of his portrait still hangs in the house. Modern day The three-part house consists of a tall, -story 5-bay Georgian portion and two long -story portions. The newest portion, the garage wing, incorporates timbers salvaged from the old slave quarters before the flooding of the valley in order to create Loch Raven Reservoir. The house features a profusion of original detail including the fine main entrance, the interior woodwork, the original arcade, period outbuildings including the smokehouse, icehouse, springhouse, and root cellar. Foundation ruins of the barn, tenant farmer's house, and tollbooth still stand, though now on neighboring properties. Neighborhoods The late-20th-century neighborhoods built on the eastern portion of the original property, including Golden Eagle, Eagle's View, Stone Eagle, and Towson Golf & Country Club (formerly Eagle's Nest Golf and Country Club) derive their names from the name of the original tract. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is listed on the Maryland and Baltimore County historical registers.

It can be hand pulled, sail powered or powered by an engine. Lifeboats may be rigid, inflatable or rigid-inflatable combination hulled vessels. Overview There are generally three types of boat, in-land (used on lakes and rivers), in- shore (used closer to shore) and off-shore (into deeper waters and further out to sea). A rescue lifeboat is a boat designed with specialised features for searching for, rescuing and saving the lives of people in peril at sea or in estuaries. In the United Kingdom and Ireland rescue lifeboats are typically vessels manned by volunteers, intended for quick dispatch, launch and transit to reach a ship or individuals in trouble at sea. Off-shore boats are referred to as 'All-weather' and generally have a range of 150‚Äì250 nautical miles. Characteristics such as capability to withstand heavy weather, fuel capacity, navigation and communication devices carried, vary with size. A vessel and her crew can be used for operation out to away from a place of safe refuge, remaining at or on the scene to search for several hours, with fuel reserves sufficient for returning; operating in up to gale force sea conditions; in daylight, fog and darkness. A smaller inshore rescue boat (IRB) or inshore life boat (ILB) and her crew would not be able to withstand (or even survive) these conditions for long. In countries such as Canada and the United States, the term 'motor lifeboat', or its US military acronym MLB, is used to designate shore-based rescue lifeboats which are generally manned by full-time coast guard service personnel. These vessels stay on standby service rather patrolling in the water, rather like a crew of fire fighters standing by for an alarm. In Canada, some lifeboats are 'co-crewed', meaning that the operator and engineer are full-time personnel while the crew members are trained volunteers. Types of craft =Inflatable boats (IB, RIB and RHIB)= Older inflatable boats, such as those introduced by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and Atlantic College in 1963, were soon made larger and those over often had plywood bottoms and were known as RIBs. These two types were superseded by newer types of RIBs which had purpose built hulls and flotation tubes. A gap in operations caused the New Zealand Lifeguard Service to reintroduce small 2 man IRB's, which have since been adopted by other organisations such as the RNLI as well. =Lifeboats= Larger non-inflatable boats are also employed as lifeboats. The RNLI fields the Severn class lifeboat and Tamar class lifeboat as all-weather lifeboats (ALB). In the United States and Canada, the term motor life boat (MLB) refers to a similar (though slightly smaller) class of non-inflatable lifeboats, the latest of which is the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat. History =China= A regular lifeboat service operated from 1854 to 1940Worcester, C. R. G. The Junkman Smiles London 1959 pp146-7 along the middle reaches of the Chang jiang or Yangtze, a major river which flows through south central China. These waters are particularly treacherous to waterway travellers owing to the canyon-like gorge conditions along the river shore and the high volume and rate of flow. The 'long river' was a principal means of communication between coastal (Shanghai) and interior China (Chongqing, once known as Chungking). These river lifeboats, usually painted red, were of a wooden pulling boat design, with a very narrow length-to-beam ratio and a shallow draft for negotiating shoal waters and turbulent rock-strewn currents. They could thus be maneuvered sideways to negotiate rocks, similar to today's inflated rafts for 'running' fast rivers, and also could be hauled upstream by human haulers, rather than beasts of burden, who walked along narrow catwalks lining the canyon sides. =United Kingdom= The first lifeboat station in Britain was at Formby beach, established in 1776 by William Hutchinson, Dock Master for the Liverpool Common Council.Yorke, Barbara & Reginald. Britain's First Lifeboat Station, Formby, 1776‚Äì1918. Alt Press. also see Liverpool's National Maritime Museum Exhibition and Archives The first non-submersible ('unimmergible') lifeboat is credited to Lionel Lukin, an Englishman who, in 1784, modified and patented a Norwegian yawl, fitting it with water-tight cork-filled chambers for additional buoyancy and a cast iron keel to keep the boat upright. The first boat specialised as a lifeboat was tested on the River Tyne in England on January 29, 1790, built by Henry Greathead. The design won a competition organised by the private Law House committee, though William Wouldhave and Lionel Lukin both claimed to be the inventor of the first lifeboat. Greathead's boat, the Original (combined with some features of Wouldhave's) entered service in 1790 and another 31 of the same design were constructed. The boat was rowed by up to 12 crew for whom cork jackets were provided. In 1807 Ludkin designed the Frances Ann for the Lowestoft service, which wasn't satisfied with Greathead's design, and this saved 300 lives over 42 years of service. The first self-righting design was developed by William Wouldhave and also entered in the Law House competition, but was only awarded a half-prize. Self-righting designs were not deployed until the 1840s. These lifeboats were manned by 6 to 10 volunteers who would row out from shore when a ship was in distress. In the case of the UK the crews were generally local boatmen. One example of this was the Newhaven Lifeboat, established in 1803 in response to the wrecking of HMS Brazen in January 1800, when only one of her crew of 105 could be saved. The UK combined many of these local efforts into a national organisation in 1824 with the establishment of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. One example of an early lifeboat was the Landguard Fort Lifeboat of 1821, designed by Richard Hall Gower. In 1851, James Beeching and James Peake produced the design for the Beeching‚ÄìPeake SR (self-righting) lifeboat which became the standard model for the new Royal National Lifeboat Institution fleet. RNLI lifeboat in Dunbar Harbour, 1981 The first motorised boat, the Duke of Northumberland, was built in 1890 and was steam powered. In 1929 the motorised lifeboat Princess Mary was commissioned and was the largest oceangoing lifeboat at that time, able to carry over 300 persons on rescue missions. The Princess Mary was stationed at Padstow in Cornwall, England.Largest Motor Lifeboat Carries 300 Persons Popular Science Monthly, September 1929 =US= 1906 postcard captioned, The start of the life-boat, Cape Cod The United States Life Saving Service (USLSS) was established in 1848. This was a United States government agency that grew out of private and local humanitarian efforts to save the lives of shipwrecked mariners and passengers. In 1915 the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard (USCG). In 1899 the Lake Shore Engine Company, at the behest of the Marquette Life Saving Station, fitted a two-cylinder engine to a lifeboat on Lake Superior, Michigan. Its operation marked the introduction of the term motor life boat (MLB). By 1909, 44 boats had been fitted with engines whose power had increased to . The sailors of the MLBs are called \\"surfmen\\", after the name given to the volunteers of the original USLSS. The main school for training USCG surfmen is the National Motor Lifeboat School (NMLBS) located at the Coast Guard Station Cape Disappointment at the mouth of the Columbia River, which is also the boundary separating Washington State from Oregon State. The sand bars which form at the entrance are treacherous and provide a tough training environment for surf lifesavers. =Canada= CCGS Cape Sutil, a motor life boat. Canada established its first lifeboat stations in the mid-to-late 19th century along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as along the shores of the Canadian side of the Great Lakes. The original organisation was called the \\"Canadian Lifesaving Service\\", not to be confused with the Royal Life Saving Society of Canada, which came later at the turn of the 20th century. In 1908, Canada had the first lifeboat (a pulling sailing boat design) to be equipped with a motor in North America, at Bamfield, British Columbia. =France= The Soci√©t√© Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM) is a French voluntary organisation founded in 1967 by merging the Soci√©t√© Centrale de Sauvetage des Naufrag√©s (founded in 1865) and the Hospitaliers Sauveteurs Bretons (1873). Its task is saving lives at sea around the French coast, including the overseas d√©partments and territories. Modern lifeboats Lifeboats have been modified by the addition of an engine since 1890 which provides more power to get in and out of the swell area inside the surf. They can be launched from shore in any weather and perform rescues further out. Older lifeboats relied on sails and oars which are slower and dependent on wind conditions or manpower. Modern lifeboats generally have electronic devices such as radios and radar to help locate the party in distress and carry medical and food supplies for the survivors. The Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat (RHIB) is now seen as the best type of craft for in- shore rescues as they are less likely to be tipped over by the wind or breakers. Specially designed jet rescue boats have also been used successfully. Unlike ordinary pleasure craft these small to medium-sized rescue craft often have a very low freeboard so that victims can be taken aboard without lifting. This means that the boats are designed to operate with water inside the boat hull and rely on flotation tanks rather than hull displacement to stay afloat and upright. Inflatables (IB)s fell out of general use after the introduction of RIBs during the 1970s. Conditions in New Zealand and other large surf zones was identified and Inflatable Rescue Boats (IRB), small non rigid powered boats, were introduced by New Zealand at Piha Beach and have been put into use in many other countries including Australia and the RNLI in the UK. =Australasia= In Australasia surf lifesaving clubs operate inflatable rescue boats (IRB) for in-shore rescues of swimmers and surfers. These boats are best typified by the rubber Zodiac and are powered by a 25-horsepower outboard motor. In the off season, these boats are used in competitive rescue racing. In addition to this, most states have a power craft rescue service. RWCs (Rescue Water Craft, Jetski) are common to many beaches, providing lifesaving service. The state of New South Wales operates dual hull fiberglass offshore boats, while Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia operate aluminum hull Jet Rescue Boats, of about 6m in length. Some regions such as North Queensland and the Northern Territory operate RNLI style rigid hull inflatables. In Auckland, New Zealand two 15-foot surf jet rescue boat powered by three stage Hamilton jet units were stationed in the 1970s and 1980s at Piha Beach the home of the Piha Surf Life Saving Club. =Canada= The Canadian Coast Guard operates makes and models of motor lifeboats that are modified RNLI and USCG designs such as the Arun and the 47 footer (respectively). =France= The SNSM operates over 500 boats manned by more than 3200 volunteer crew, from all-weather lifeboats to jetskis, dispersed in 218 stations (including 15 in overseas territories). In 2009 the SNSM was responsible for about half of all sea rescue operations and saved 5,400 lives in 2816 call-outs and assisted 2140 boats in distress. =Germany= German lifeboat SK Hermann Marwede of the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service (DGzRS) In Germany, the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service (DGzRS) has provided naval rescue service since 1865. It is a civilian, non-profit organisation which relies entirely on individual funding (no government support) and has a variety of boats and ships, the biggest being the Hermann Marwede with 400 tons displacement, the largest lifeboat in the world, operating from the island of Helgoland. The DGzRS operates from 54 stations in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It has 20 rescue cruisers (usually piggybacking a smaller rescue boat), mostly operated by own full-time personnel and 40 rescue boats operated by volunteers. Voluntary organisations such as the German Red Cross (Wasserwacht) and DLRG provide lifeguarding and emergency response for rivers, lakes, coasts and such like. =Netherlands= The Dutch lifeboat association Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij (KNRM) has developed jet-driven RIB lifeboats. This has resulted in 3 classes, the largest is the Arie Visser class: length 18,80 m, twin jet, 2 x , max. speed , capacity 120 persons. Some local lifeguard organisations also respond on the SAR. =Scandinavia= Most Scandinavian countries also have volunteer lifeboat societies. =UK and Ireland= Royal National Lifeboat Institution Severn class lifeboat in Poole Harbour, Dorset, England. This is the largest class of UK lifeboat, at 17 metres long The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (or RNLI) maintains lifeboats around the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland manned largely by unpaid volunteers, most part-time, with equipment funded through voluntary donations. In Britain, the RNLI design and build several types of all-weather motor lifeboats, the Arun class kept permanently afloat, the Tyne class slipway-launched boat and the Mersey class carriage-launched boat. More recently the Arun replacement Trent and Severn class prototype models were delivered in 1992 with the first production Trent arriving in 1994 and the Severn in 1996. The first production Tamar class, replacement for the Tyne went into service in December 2005 and the FCB2 class replacement for the Mersey is being developed for deployment sometime in 2013. The FCB2 class of lifeboat was on 11 April 2011 accepted as a proven design and given the class name Shannon, continuing the RNLI tradition of naming all weather lifeboat classes after rivers in the British Isles. Scarborough lifeboat station in North Yorkshire and Hoylake lifeboat station on the Wirral are two of the first stations to be allocated one of the new boats. Scarborough's Shannon class lifeboat will be named Frederick William Plaxton in his memory as he left a substantial legacy to the RNLI specifically to purchase Scarborough's next all weather lifeboat. Independent services There are at least 70 lifeboat services in Britain and Ireland that are independent of the RNLI, providing lifeboats and crews 24 hours a day all year round, manned by unpaid volunteers. They operate inland, inshore or offshore, according to local needs. =US= The United States Life Saving Service began using motorised lifeboats in 1899. Models derived from this hull design remained in use until 1987. Today in U.S. waters rescue-at-sea is part of the duties of the United States Coast Guard. The coast guard's MLBs, an integral part of the USCG's fleet, are built to withstand the most severe conditions at sea. Designed to be self-bailing, self-righting and practically unsinkable, MLBs are used for surf rescue in heavy weather. 36' (foot) The T model was introduced in 1929. At length overall, beam and with a two-ton lead keel, she was powered by a Sterling gas engine and had a speed of nine knots (17 km/h). From the early days of the 20th century the 36 MLB was the mainstay of coastal rescue operations for over 30 years until the 44 MLB was introduced in 1962. Built at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland, 218 36 T, TR and TRS MLBs were built between 1929 and 1956. Based on a hull design from the 1880s, the 36 TRS and her predecessors remain the longest active hull design in the Coast Guard, serving the Coast Guard and the Life Saving Services for almost 100 years, the last one, CG-36535, serving Depoe Bay MLB Station in Oregon until 1987. 52' (foot) In the mid-1930s the USCG ordered two 52-foot wooden-hulled motor lifeboats (MLBs) for service where there was a high traffic of merchants ships and heavy seas that had a high capacity in the number of person that could be rescued of approximately 100 and could tow ten fully loaded standard life boats used by most merchant vessels. Unlike the older 36-foot, the 52-foot MLBs had a diesel engine. The 52-foot wooden-hulled MLBs were the only Coast Guard vessels less than in length that were given names, CG-52300 Invincible and CG-52301 Triumph. Both were built at the United States Coast Guard Yard; Invincible was initially assigned to Station Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Triumph was assigned to Station Point Adams in Oregon. In time Invincible was also transferred to the Pacific Northwest at Station Grays Harbor. Triumph later capsized and sank during a rescue mission on January 12, 1961. By that time, the Coast Guard had already built two of the four steel-hulled successor 52-foot Motor Lifeboats. , the steel-hulled 52' MLBs continue in service. 44' (foot) During the 1960s the Coast Guard replaced the MLB with the newly designed boat. These steel-hulled boats were more capable and more complicated than the wooden lifeboats they replaced. In all 110 vessels would be built by the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay between 1962 and 1972 with an additional 52 built by the RNLI, Canadian Coast Guard and others under licence from the USCG. The last active 44' MLB in the United States Coast Guard was retired in May 2009, however these boats are still in active service elsewhere around the globe. The 44' MLB can be found in many third world countries and is faithfully serving the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol in Australia and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard Federation. The current engine configuration is twin Detroit Diesel 6v53s that put out each at a max RPM of 2800. 30' (foot) surf rescue boat Another surf capable boat that the Coast Guard has used in recent years is the 30' surf rescue boat (SRB) introduced in 1983. The 30' SRB was self-righting and self bailing and designed with marked differences from the typical lifeboats used by the Coast Guard up until the early 1980s. The 30' SRB is not considered to be a MLB, but was generally used in a similar capacity. Designed to perform search and rescue in adverse weather the vessel is generally operated with a crew of two, a surfman and an engineer. The crew both stand on the coxswain flat, protected by the superstructure on the bow and stern. The boat's appearance has caused many to comment that it looks like a \\"Nike Tennis Shoe\\". Since 1997 the introduction of the faster 47' MLB and the phasing out of the 44' MLBs made the 30 footers obsolete. The class of vessels underwent an overhaul in the early nineties to extend their life until the newer and faster 47' motor lifeboats came into service, and in the late 1990s most of the 30 footers were de-commissioned. One still remains on active duty at Motor Lifeboat Station Depoe Bay in Depoe Bay, Oregon and is used almost daily. This station was host to the last 36' motor lifeboat in the late 1980s. 47' (foot) The USCG has since designed and built new aluminum lifeboats and the first production boat was delivered to the USCG in 1997. The 47-Foot Motor Lifeboat is able to withstand impacts of three times the acceleration of gravity, can survive a complete roll-over and is self-righting in less than 10 seconds with all machinery and instruments remaining fully operational. The 47' MLB can travel at to reach her destination. There are 117 operational with a total of 200 scheduled to be delivered to the USCG. A further 27 models are being built by MetalCraft Marine under licence to the Canadian Coast Guard.

It is located on the eastern bank of the River Wye, opposite Piercefield House, two miles north of the Welsh town of Chepstow. The village is immediately north of Tutshill, within the parish of Tidenham. The population in 2011 was 284. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=E35000331 History Woodcroft was originally common land in \\"Bishton tithing\\" to the south of Tidenham Chase. Powder House Farm standing east of the road between Tutshill and Woodcroft was one of the farm-houses on the Tidenham manor estate in 1769 and was a stone house with a thatched roof in 1813. At least one cottage had been built on the common east of the road at Woodcroft by 1712, and by 1815 there was a small settlement of six or seven cottages.Tidenham including Lancaut: Introduction, Victoria County History Woodcroft became a sizable hamlet by the end of the 19th century with cottages, somewhat scattered, covering much of the area of the former common, and some more widely spaced along the road to the north. In the mid-20th century numbers of detached houses were built along the road running northwards from Woodcroft and up onto the former chase, their owners attracted by the views over the River Severn to the east and the River Wye to the west. In the 1870s Sophia Morgan of Tidenham House was organizing evangelical services with coffee at a building in Woodcroft, partly in an attempt to combat drunkenness among the Irish labourers building the Wye Valley Railway. The Memorial Temperance Hall, a two-story stone building erected at Woodcroft by Christiana Morgan in 1887 in memory of her husband T. H. Morgan, was used for religious services, coffee rooms, and reading rooms, etc. Features General view of Wintour's Leap, overlooking the River Wye at Woodcroft One of the main attractions in the area is Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust's Lancaut Nature Reserve. Within the SSSI Nature Reserve is a cliff face called Wintour's Leap, enjoyed by walkers, naturalists and rock climbers. Access to cliffs is by permission of the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust managed in conjunction with the British Mountaineering Council for rock climbing The reserve provides important nesting habitat for peregrine falcons that enjoy commanding views over the Wye Valley. The village straddles the boundary of the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the Offa's Dyke Path passes through it.

Biography In the early 1960s, he was one of the first artists who worked creating intersections between poetry, word and mass media, fixing theoretical basis and assembling traditions of avant-garde and Pop Art. Lamberto Pignotti, together with Eugenio Miccini, are considered to be one of the initiators of Italian visual poetry. He collaborated with national and international journals, with television programs of Rai. He was professor in the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florence and in DAMS of Bologna, where he hold courses on avant-garde, mass-media, and new media. Theoretician and artist using synesthesia in the arts, he creates performances and poetry events where are present linguistic, verbal, and gesture signs, involving the five senses. We have performance actions with poems to eat, to drink, to hear, to sniff, to put in action with gestures and voice. His visual poems are realized as collage elaborations with writing on images and photography taken from the world of mass media, with the aim to make evident its contradictions in a ludic process similar to the one of Pop Art. Lamberto Pignotti has realized object-books with various materials, performance using text fragments variously combined, also involving the public. His work has been presented in many countries and is included also in didactical books in Italy, such as Storia dell'arte Italiana di Electa-Bruno Mondadori. The most relevant Italian art critics were interested in Lamberto Pignotti's work, among them: Gillo Dorfles, Giulio Carlo Argan, Umberto Eco, Achille Bonito Oliva.

It was the birthplace of the architect Sir Christopher Wren. The parish includes the hamlets of Holloway, Milton, The Green, Underhill and Upton. History East Knoyle was part of the ancient Hundred of Downton. Unusually for England, parish registers survive from 1538 and are kept in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre.East Knoyle, Wiltshire, England at genuki.org.uk John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì1872) notes two tythings in East Knoyle: Milton and Upton.Descriptive gazetteer entries for East Knoyle at visionofbritain.org.uk East Knoyle's population has risen and fallen in recent centuries, with a period of growth in the 19th century. In 1801 the population was 853, and by 1831 it had reached 1028, but in 1901 it was down again to 814. In 1951, the population was still at 821, but by 1971 it was only 699.A vision of East Knoyle AP/CP at visionofbritain.org.uk The market town of Hindon was established in the north-east of East Knoyle parish in the early 13th century and became a separate civil parish in the later 19th century. In 1885 the southern part of the former parish of Pertwood was added to East Knoyle. Most of this addition was transferred to Chicklade parish in 1986. Primitive Methodists built a chapel, later called Ebenezer chapel, at The Green in 1843; this closed sometime before 1977. Charles Jupe, a silk manufacturer of Mere, built a Congregational chapel and schoolroom in the village in 1854, replacing an earlier chapel. By 1987 the church had fallen into disuse. The school next to the Congregational church became a British School, but closed in 1881. A National School was built in 1872‚Äì1873 on land near the church provided by Alfred Seymour. The design by George Aitchison Jnr has windows in Moorish style. The remaining village school merged with the school at Hindon in 1984. The Warminster‚ÄìShaftesbury road ran through East Knoyle village. In the 20th century this became part of the primary A350 route between the M4 motorway and the south coast, and took a straighter course to the east of the village. Notable buildings =Parish church= St Mary's Church The Church of England Parish Church of St Mary was begun before the 1066 conquest. Pevsner described its chancel as \\"Norman in its bones\\" and wrote that its 17th-century plaster decoration, a \\"surprise and delight\\", \\"ought to be the purpose of a visit from every Wiltshire tourist\\". The church was extended in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, with a large tower added in the 15th. Plaster work in the chancel depicting biblical scenes was designed by Dean Christopher Wren (father of the prolific architect Sir Christopher Wren) in about 1639. Five of the six bells are from the 18th century. The building was further extended in the 19th century, along with restoration in 1845 by Wyatt and Brandon, and interior alterations in 1875-6 by Sir Arthur Blomfield. The church was declared Grade I listed in 1966. Since 2008, the ecclesiastical parish forms part of the benefice of St Bartholomew, a group of six parishes. St Mary's had a chapelry at Hindon from the 13th century. Hindon became a separate vicarage in 1869. =Knoyle Place= Knoyle Place served as the rectory until the 1940s. A 14th-century range, rebuilt in the 17th, stands next to a larger five-bay 18th-century range faced with ashlar. =Clouds House= Clouds House, a Grade II* listed country house north-west of East Knoyle village, was built in 1886‚Äì1891 for Percy Wyndham, to designs of Philip Webb. It is one of Webb's grandest designs. It is now occupied by the Action on Addiction charity as a treatment centre for drug and alcohol dependence. =War memorial= The memorial was dedicated in 1920 to those from the village who died in the First World War, and has subsequently been used to commemorate those who died in the Second World War and the Iraq War. Governance East Knoyle elects a consultative parish council under Wiltshire Council, which has its offices in Trowbridge. The parish is represented in Parliament by the member for South West Wiltshire, Andrew Murrison. The village falls in the Nadder and East Knoyle electoral ward, which stretches east‚Äìwest from Burcombe Without, crossing to East Knoyle before stretching south to Donhead St Mary. The total ward population as recorded in the 2011 census was 4,257. Amenities East Knoyle has a village hall, between the church and the former school. The hall was created in 1908 by the Seymour family, using a 14th-century hall house for one part of it. The village has a community-owned shop and post office. There is a pub at The Green, the Fox and Hounds.

It is a Church of England church in the Diocese of Sheffield. The building is Grade I listed building and dates back to at least the 12th century AD. It is a prominent feature within the village, and can be seen from all directions. History There was a church on this site at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, one of only 15 in what would become the county of South YorkshireHistory of the Churches in Treeton: St. Helen's Parish Church. Treetonweb, from The Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, Vol. XVII. Treeton, South Yorkshire, England. Accessed 9 June 2012. The current building was originally constructed c. 1175 to c. 1200, after the previous church, in the Norman style, was demolished and re-built. Only the arches, which are clearly Norman, and a single child's coffin, remain from the original church. It was dedicated to Christian Saint Helen. The lower half of the square tower that remains today, was constructed in the 12th century, and of rubble walling. It is on the westernmost edge of the church. A 13th-century effigy of a medieval knight, the first in the area and commonly referred to as \\"Sir Gilbert\\", a reference to the Earl of Shrewsbury, is built into the western wall. Unfortunately, the shield of the knight is too worn for the identification of any coat of arms that could verify the historical accuracy of this belief. The building was remodelled in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and restored in 1869 and 1892. There were also several additions in the 15th century, including the present lead roofing, the southern porch, the south chapel, and the western part of the nave. Although the lower half of the tower was constructed in the 12th century, the upper half, which is made of a noticeably different stone and is surrounded on all sides by crenellations with a small upright spire in each corner, was also constructed in the 15th century and contains six bells, three of them not installed until 1892. A clock face can be seen on the eastern side of the tower. On 29 March 1968, it was listed as a Grade I building, and has remained so ever since.British Listed Building, St Helen's Church, Treeton, retrieved 27 May 2012 Theft The church is still in use by the congregation of the village of Treeton. In 2008, police found three youths on the church roof, wearing masks, balaclavas and gloves, when over ¬£100,000 worth of lead had already been stolen previously in 10 separate raids, but they were released without charge because they \\"might be there just for the view\\". No evidence was found that the youths were planning to steal the lead, even though some had been rolled up on the roof.

The island is located off the north-west coast of Zanzibar's main island, also known as Unguja. The wedge-shaped island is long but only wide at its widest point (in the south). It is surrounded by a reef, making it somewhat isolated from the rest of Zanzibar, even though its southern shore is only from Mkokotoni on Unguja Island. The island has two villages, Jongowe in the south and Gomani further north. There are no roads or cars on the island, although people travel frequently by boat between the villages and to Unguja. This significant archaeological site contains a large number of collapsed stone structures including private houses and several mosques, the largest of which is located on the shore facing the village of Mkokotoni on Unguja. The site has been investigated by Mark Horton and Catherine Clark in the 1980s and 1990s Horton, M. and Clark, C. (1985) Archaeological Survey of Zanzibar. Azania 20 (1): 167-171. C. and by Henriette R√∏dland in 2017 and 2019.R√∏dland, H. (2017). Preliminary Report from Archaeological Survey on Tumbatu Island, Zanzibar Archipelago, Tanzania. Nyame Akuma: 89, 29-33. It was inhabited between the 12th and 15th centuries CE, a time of expansion and growth for many Swahili sites along the East African coast. The first known Swahili or proto-Swahili sites are dated to the 6th and 7th centuries, and some of the earliest Swahili settlements can be found on Zanzibar at places such as Unguja Ukuu and Fukuchani. These were African fishing and farming communities who traded with each other as well as inland East African communities and the wider Indian Ocean world, and who started their conversion to Islam in the 8th century, to which the earliest mosque has been dated.Horton, M. (1996). Shanga: The archaeology of a Muslim trading community on the coast of East Africa. Memoirs of the British Institute in Eastern Africa Larger towns such as Tumbatu developed as a result of this extensive trade in the early second millennium CE, and archaeological investigations have uncovered large amounts of imported ceramics and glass beads at the site, attesting to the extensive trade networks existing between African urban areas and other Indian Ocean ports. Various local production activities also took place within Tumbatu, such as iron and pottery production, and spinning. There are currently no other known archaeological sites on the island, although some older structures of unknown date are known within the village of Jongowe. Tumbatu likely had a strong relationship with neighbouring Mkokotoni, which is easily accessible by boat. Historically, the island is of interest. Islanders who belong to the Shirazi ethnic group claim descent from Persian royalty that reputedly arrived in the ninth century. These kinds of oral traditions are common along the entire Swahili coast, and may be reflective of more recent colonial and post- colonial developments in East Africa, which emphasised race and tribal difference, as more recent archaeological and linguistic evidence indicates local African origin for the Swahili culture and settlements.Spear, T. The Shirazi in Swahili Traditions, Culture, and History. History in Africa, 11: 291-305 The late medieval city (13th century) was described in a chronicle known as the \\"Tumbatu Manuscript\\". This unique manuscript was apparently burned in a big fire in the village circa 1938. Nevertheless, it inspired Dutch maritime anthropologist and ethnohistorian A. H. J. Prins to visit the island by dhow from Zanzibar and identify the ancient Shirazi port city's ruins in June 1957.Prins, A. H. J.

The Italian Castagnari company issued and continues a line of signature instruments called keanebox in his honor. Early life James Keane was born in Drimnagh, south Dublin City in Co Dublin. He reportedly began playing at age six, and lilting since before he could talk. The Keane house in Dublin was a musical landmark on the traditional music scene in the 1950s and 1960s. Keane's mother and father were both fiddle players from musical communities in County Longford and County Clare, and would play host to the legendary players who traveled from all over Ireland to perform in the capital city. These guests greatly affected James and his brother Se√°n Keane, the fiddler with the Chieftains, as did their summer trips to Longford and Clare where they encountered the music at its roots. By the age of ten, James had become a fixture on the late 1950s Dublin traditional scene regularly performing with S√©amus Ennis, Leo Rowsome, Sonny Brogan and Tommy Reck, honing his skills under their guidance. While still in his early teens, James co- founded what would become one of Ireland's most heralded music ensembles, the Castle C√©il√≠ Band with Mick O'Connor, his brother and others. The band would go on to win numerous Oireachtas competitions, and the All-Ireland Senior C√©il√≠ Band competition in Thurles in 1965. He won the senior Accordion Championship while still a junior in the Dundalk open accordion championships in 1964, 1965 and 1966. He won the All-Ireland junior (under 18) Championship at Fleadh Cheoil na h√âireann in Mullingar in 1963. It was in this period that accordion virtuoso James Keane from Dublin became a band-member and contributor of traditional music to the ballad-focused trio. Shortly after Keane left the band, Ryan's Fancy split. Keane moved to New York City, where he became part of the traditional scene there through the 1980s to the present day. Move to the United States Keane emigrated to the United States where he performed in numerous bands, including the Ellis Island C√©il√≠ Band, which was formed for the Smithsonian Institution's Centennial Celebration honoring the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 1991, Keane was made Traditionalist of the Year by The Irish Echo, and his album Sweeter as the Years Roll By was chosen as one of the top twenty traditional albums of the last twenty years by Irish America magazine in their anniversary edition. He is a founding member of Fingal, the critically acclaimed group with Randal Bays and D√°ith√≠ Sproule, he tours regularly, performing music and lecturing in colleges about the history of Irish traditional music. He has been flown back to Ireland on numerous occasions for awards and performances, including a trip to participate when the City of Dublin was deemed a European Capital of Culture by the EU. In 2004 an event to honor Keane was organized by Luke Kelly's biographerDes Geraghty‚Äîheld at Liberty Hall, and attended by dignitaries including Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, prime minister of Ireland.

Originally the RegioSprinter was designated as a Regional Combustion-engined Railbus (Regional-Verbrennungstriebwagen or RVT) by Duewag AG. Developed as prototypes for fast regional railway services on the plains, the RegioSprinter still has the fastest acceleration of any multiple unit or railbus in Germany. Due to several technical and conceptual defects, however, only very few were built. Based on their experience with the Regiosprinter Siemens developed its successor, the Desiro, which was initially marketed as the Regiosprinter 2. In 1999, all the Vogtlandbahn vehicles were converted to meet tramway regulations (BO Strab), in order to be able to transfer to a tram line in the centre of Zwickau.  Design  The vehicles are designed with three sections. In the two, single-axled end modules are the driver's cabs and the drive units like those on trams. In the middle is a twin-axled, unmotored module. Two thirds of the vehicle has a low floor. The seats are arranged in a 2+3 configuration, there is no toilet due to the short journey distances envisaged.

Today (as at 2006), RegioSprinter are used on the following lines: * Southern Rurtalbahn: D√ºren ‚Äì Heimbach * Northern Rurtalbahn: D√ºren ‚Äì J√ºlich ‚Äì Linnich (from J√ºlich part of the J√ºlich‚ÄìDalheim railway) * B√∂rde railway: D√ºren ‚Äì Z√ºlpich ‚Äì Euskirchen (exclusively tourist traffic at weekends) Under contract to DB Regio NRW there is also a railbus in service on the RB 39 route (Schwalm-Nette-Bahn) between M√∂nchengladbach Hbf and Dalheim. Because the vehicle fleet of the Rur Valley railway has a large reserve, in past years RegioSprinters from this company have helped out on other private railways, for example on the Dortmund-M√§rkischen Eisenbahn, the Nord-Ostsee-Bahn and the VIAS. = Vogtlandbahn = VBG in Zwotental From 1996 the Vogtlandbahn bought a total of 18 vehicles for use on the lines from Zwickau to Adorf/Vogtl. and Reichenbach im Vogtl. to Klingenthal. Because the completion of these routes was repeatedly delayed after their refurbishment, the new vehicles initially worked the line from Zwickau to Bad Brambach. At present the railbuses are in services on the following Vogtlandbahn lines: * Zwickau Zentrum ‚Äì Zwickau (Sachs) Hbf ‚Äì Falkenstein/Vogtl. ‚Äì Zwotental ‚Äì Klingenthal ‚Äì Kraslice (‚Äì Karlovy Vary doln√≠ n.) (KBS 539) * Zwickau (Sachs) Hbf ‚Äì Reichenbach (Vogtl) ob Bf ‚Äì Herlasgr√ºn ‚Äì Plauen (Vogtl) ob Bf ‚Äì Adorf/Vogtl. (KBS 544) * Hof ‚Äì Sch√∂nberg/Vogtl. ‚Äì Mehltheuer ‚Äì Plauen (Vogtl) ob Bf ‚Äì Herlasgr√ºn ‚Äì Falkenstein/Vogtl. ‚Äì Zwotental ‚Äì Adorf (Vogtl) Until the timetable change in December 2006 the Vogtlandbahn's RegioSprinters were also on duty on the VB 7 line between Sch√∂nberg/Vogtland and Schleiz West. Services on this route were withdrawn on 9 December 2006 by the local public transport company of the free state of Thuringia. Moreover, in 2006 two of the railbuses (VT 36 and VT 39) were hired to the Prignitz railway, which used them on their lines in the western Ruhrgebiet due to a shortage of stock. = N√¶rumbanen (Denmark) = A RegioSprinter of the N√¶rumbanen In 1999 the N√¶rumbanen (LNJ) in the Copenhagen area bought four RegioSprinter railbuses and deployed them on the line between N√¶rum and J√¶gersborg. Since 2002 operations have been run by Lokalbanen A/S (LB), which took over several smaller railway companies in the Copenhagen area. The railbuses were owned at the time by the Hovedstadens Lokalbaner, which hired them to the LB. = GW Train Regio (Czechia) = Since 2016, 15 units were purchased and operated by a Czech private operator GW Train Regio (previously known as Viamont, a.s.), who operated the route Karlovy Vary ‚Äì Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ since 2006 with Regiosprinter units rented from Vogtlandbahn. Purchased units (11 from Rurtalbahn, 4 from Vogtlandbahn) were refurbished by Czech company CZ Loko, with new seats Borcad REGIO+, a new accessible toilet, air conditioning, WiFi, power outlets for passengers. Since September 2016 are operated on route Karlovy Vary ‚Äì Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ (4 units) and since December 2017 11 units are operated on ≈†umava local lines ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice ‚Äì ƒåern√Ω K≈ô√≠≈æ, ƒå√≠ƒçenice ‚Äì Nov√© √ödol√≠ and Strakonice ‚Äì Volary. It seems to be the biggest fleet of Regiosprinters at the moment. One unit was damaged beyond repair after the frontal crash with another train (former DB 628 unit) on May 3rd 2018. While the 628 unit was returned to the service, the Regiosprinter was left to be used for spare parts and another unit was from bought from Rurtalbahn, sent for the same upgrade as previous units to refill the fleet. = Calgary Transit = In 1996 Calgary Transit experimented with a new commuter rail service from Anderson station (Calgary) to a temporary station at 162 Ave. The RegioSprinters operated on a CP rail line adjacent to the LRT rails today. Service ended in 2001 with the opening of the line extension which served from Anderson station (Calgary) to Somerset-Bridlewood station. Somerset-Bridlewood station is approximately 500m south of the original 162 Ave Station.

History Sites in Luqa Luqa was established as a separate Parish from that of Gudja on 15 May 1634 by a decree issued by Pope Urban VIII. In 1592 the village of Luqa was hit by a plague epidemic, which hit all the population of Malta and caused many deaths. A sign of this sad episode is the cemetery found in Carmel Street, Alley 4 where people were buried in a field changed into a cemetery. Another sad tragedy for ƒ¶al Luqa was the cholera epidemic of 1850 where 13 people lost their lives. A cemetery is still present in Valletta Road as a reminder of this tragedy. During the early 20th century ƒ¶al Luqa took prominence because of the airport. The Royal Air Force established RAF Station Luqa, an airfield with runways which later on evolved as a civilian airport. The RAF established military and civilian buildings in the area close to the airfield/airport and in ƒ¶al Farruƒ°. They used the airfield until it closed on 31 March 1979 when it was transferred to the Maltese Government to be transformed into a civilian airport. However they still used the domestic site for their own military force. Many lives were lost during the Second World War in Luqa, and many buildings destroyed due to heavy bombardment. A tragedy which is still remembered happened on 9 April 1942 when a bomb hit a wartime shelter and a well and the people inside the shelter were buried alive. The Local Council still remembers the people who lost their lives during WWII with a ceremony of the laying of bay wreaths together with the other local organisations and clubs.

He was the eldest son of Aonghus M√≥r mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay. Alasdair √ìg seems to first appear on record in 1264, when he was held as a hostage of the Scottish Crown for his father's good behaviour. During Alasdair √ìg's career, the Scottish realm endured a succession crisis as a result of the unexpected death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, heir to the Scottish throne, in 1290. One of several factions that staked a claim to the throne was the Bruce kindred. Both Alasdair √ìg and his father were cosignatories of the Turnberry Band, a pact that may have partly concerned the Bruces' royal aspirations. Aonghus M√≥r last appears on record in 1293, which seems to have been about the time that Alasdair √ìg succeeded him as chief of Clann Domhnaill. Alasdair √ìg's wife was apparently a member of Clann Dubhghaill. This marital alliance evidently brought Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill into a territorial conflict. The chief of the latter kindred, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, was a close adherent to the successful claimant to the kingship, John Balliol. Following the latter's defeat and overthrow by Edward I, King of England, Alasdair √ìg aligned his kindred with the English in an attempt to contend with Clann Dubhghaill. As such, Alasdair √ìg was employed as the agent of English authority in the west, and Clann Domhnaill appears on record throughout the 1290s campaigning against Clann Dubhghaill, Clann Ruaidhr√≠, and the Comyn kindred. Alasdair √ìg's rivalry with Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill apparently brought about his own demise, as Alasdair √ìg appears to be identical to the like-named man slain by Clann Dubhghaill in 1299. The Clann Domhnaill succession is uncertain following this date, as several men appear on record accorded the territorial designation \\"of Islay\\", a style that may correspond to the lordship of Islay. Alasdair √ìg is known to have had at least six sons. He may have been the father of the apparent Clann Domhnaill chief who was slain caimpaining in Ireland in 1318. Over the succeeding decades, the Clann Domhnaill chiefship came to be permanently occupied by the descendants of Aonghus √ìg. As a result, Alasdair √ìg's reputation suffered within early modern Clann Domhnaill tradition, and the history of his descendants‚ÄîClann Alasdair‚Äîwas largely ignored. Nevertheless, the most prominent Clann Domhnaill gallowglass families descended from him, and members of Clann Alasdair claimed the Clann Domhnaill chiefship into the last half of the fourteenth century. Alasdair √ìg may also be the eponymous ancestor of Clann Alasdair of Loup. Parentage Locations relating to Alasdair √ìg's life and times.

Aonghus M√≥r, and his Clann Somhairle kinsman E√≥ghan Mac Dubhghaill, evidently named their eldest sons after the kings of Scotland. Both E√≥ghan's son, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, and Alasdair √ìg himself, appear to have been named after Alexander III, King of Scotland as both are unlikely to have been born during the reign of the latter's father, Alexander II, King of Scotland.Stringer (2005) p. 55; McDonald (2004) p. 186; McDonald (1997) p. 140. Before Alexander II, virtually no Scots are known to have borne the name Alexander. Very quickly, however, leading families within the Scottish realm began to emulate the royal family.Hammond (2007) p. 89. The use of the name by leading members of Clann Somhairle appears to reflect the spread of Scottish influence into its own orbit,Holton (2017) p. 140; McDonald (2004) pp. 186‚Äì187; McDonald (1997) pp. 109, 140‚Äì141. and could be evidence of the kindred's attempt to align itself closer to the Scottish Crown.McDonald (2004) p. 186; McDonald (1997) pp. 109, 140‚Äì141; Cowan (1990) p. 119. Clann Domhnaill under Aonghus M√≥r =Hostage of the Scottish Crown= Alexander III. The device is similar to that of his English contemporaries, Henry III and Edward I.Birch (1905) pp. 28‚Äì29, 119 fig. 12. In the midpoint of the thirteenth century, Alexander II, and his son and successor Alexander III, made several attempts to incorporate the Hebrides into the Scottish realm.Oram (2011) chs. 13‚Äì14; Reid (2011). Forming a part of the Kingdom of the Isles, these islands were a component of the far- flung Norwegian commonwealth.Beuermann (2010); Brown, M (2004) p. 68. The independence of the Islesmen, and the lurking threat of their nominal overlord, the formidable H√°kon H√°konarson, King of Norway, constituted a constant source of concern for the Scottish Crown. In 1261, Alexander III sent an embassy to Norway attempting to negotiate the purchase of the Isles from the Norwegian Crown. When mediation came to nought, Alexander III evidently orchestrated an invasion into the Isles as means to openly challenge his Norwegian counterpart's authority.Crawford (2013); W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49; Brown, M (2004) p. 56; McDonald (2003a) p. 43; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 105‚Äì106; Cowan (1990) pp. 117‚Äì118; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 18‚Äì19; Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 106; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 212. Thus provoked, H√°kon assembled an enormous fleet to reassert Norwegian sovereignty along the north and west coasts of Scotland.Reid, NH (2011); Reid, NH (1984) p. 19. Having rendezvoused with his vassals in the Isles‚Äîone of whom was Aonghus M√≥r himself‚ÄîH√°kon secured several castles, oversaw raids into the surrounding mainland.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 257‚Äì258. A series of inconclusive skirmishes upon the Ayrshire coast, coupled with ever-worsening weather, discouraged the Norwegians and convinced them to turn for home. H√°kon died that December.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 258‚Äì261. As a result of his failure to break Scottish power, Alexander III seized the initiative the following year, and oversaw a series of invasions into the Isles and northern Scotland. Recognising this dramatic shift in royal authority, Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Mann and the Isles submitted to the Scots within the year,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 261‚Äì262; McDonald (1997) pp. 115‚Äì116; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 213‚Äì214. and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles.Brown, M (2004) p. 84. In the wake of the Norwegian withdrawal, and the violent extension of Scottish royal authority into the Isles, Aonghus M√≥r had no choice but to submit to the Scots. He was forced to hand over his sonPenman, MA (2014) pp. 63‚Äì64 n. 3, 84 n. 85; Roberts (1999) pp. 112‚Äì113; McDonald (1997) pp. 109‚Äì110, 159, 159 n. 5; Duncan (1996) p. 581; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Cowan (1990) p. 120; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 280‚Äì281 nn. 4‚Äì5; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 214‚Äì215.‚Äîseemingly Alasdair √ìg‚Äîwho was consequently held at Ayr as a hostage of the Scottish Crown for Aonghus M√≥r's good behaviour.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 63‚Äì64 n. 3, 84 n. 85; Murray (2002) p. 221; Roberts (1999) pp. 112‚Äì113; McDonald (1997) pp. 109‚Äì110, 159, 159 n. 5; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 280‚Äì281 nn. 4‚Äì5; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 214; Bremner (1912) p. 247 n. 3; Munch; Goss (1874) p. 211; Thomson, T (1836) p. *9; Dillon (1822) p. 367. The fact that his son was accompanied by a nurse suggests that he was merely a young child at the time.McDonald (1997) p. 159 n. 5. =The Turnberry Band= The seal of Robert Bruce VI.Stevenson, JH (1914) pp. 196‚Äì197 pl. xxx fig. 6. The Turnberry Band was concluded at this man's principal residence, Turnberry Castle.Duffy (2013) p. 125. Alasdair √ìg next appears on record in about 1284/1285/1286, when he confirmed his father's grant of the church of St Ciar√°n to the Cistercian monastery of Paisley.Penman, M (2014) p. 19; Penman, MA (2014) p. 63 n. 12; McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Barrow (2008); Murray (2002) pp. 221‚Äì222, 227 n. 10; McDonald (1997) pp. 149, 162; Duffy (1993) p. 206; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 488‚Äì489; Howson (1841) p. 81; Registrum Monasterii (1832) pp. 128‚Äì129; Document 3/31/4 (n.d.). The witness lists of Clann Somhairle charters spanning the thirteenth century reveal that, as time wore on, the kindred increasingly surrounded itself with men drawn from a Scottish background as opposed to that of men mainly of a Hebridean milieu.McDonald (1997) p. 149. In fact, Alasdair √ìg's transaction with the Cistercians marks the first record of Robert Bruce VII, a future King of Scotland.Penman, M (2014) p. 19; Penman, MA (2014) p. 63 n. 12; McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Barrow (2008); Barrow (2005) p. 35; Duffy (1993) p. 206. Other evidence of the kindred's incorporation within Scotland concerns the formation of alliances with various factions within the realm.McDonald (1997) pp. 141‚Äì142. Whilst Clann Dubhghall forged ties with the dominant Comyn kindred, Clann Domhnaill evidently aligned itself to the Bruce kindred.Duffy (2013). The latter partnership appears to owe itself to the unsettled period immediately after Alexander III's unexpected demise in March 1286. Although the leading magnates of the realm had previously recognised Alexander III's granddaughter, Margaret, as his legitimate heir, there were two major factions in the realm that possessed competing claims to the kingship. At the beginning of April, Robert Bruce V, Lord of Annandale announced his claim to the throne, whilst John Balliol‚Äîa magnate backed by the Comyns‚Äîseems to have declared a claim of his own before the end of the month.McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Duncan (1966) pp. 185‚Äì186.

It is possible that the Bruce faction regarded its claim to be weaker to that of Comyn-Balliol faction.McNamee (2012a) ch. 2. In September, members of the faction concluded a pact, known as the Turnberry Band, in which certain Scottish and Anglo-Irish magnates‚Äîincluding Alasdair √ìg and his father‚Äîpledged to support one another.Holton (2017) pp. 148‚Äì149; Petre, J (2015) p. 606; Penman, M (2014) pp. 25‚Äì26; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 63‚Äì64, 63 n. 2; Duffy (2013); McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; McNamee (2012b) ch. introduction ¬∂ 15; Young; Stead (2010a) p. 30; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 48; Hartland (2007) pp. 343‚Äì344; Barrow (2005) pp. 24‚Äì26, 75‚Äì76; Barrow; Royan (2004) pp. 172‚Äì173; Brown, M (2004) p. 256; Duffy (2004); Blakely (2003) p. 110, 110 nn. 55‚Äì56; Murray (2002) p. 221; Roberts (1999) p. 129; McDonald (1997) pp. 161‚Äì162; Duffy (1993) pp. 151, 154, 206; Barrow (1990) p. 129; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 57‚Äì58; Reid, N (1982) pp. 76‚Äì78; Lamont (1981) p. 160; Duncan (1966) p. 188; Fraser (1888b) pp. xxxi ¬ß 12, 219‚Äì220; Stevenson, J (1870a) pp. 22‚Äì23 ¬ß 12; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.d). One possibility is that Alasdair √ìg's confirmation charter was granted immediately before or after the conclusion of the Turnberry pact. Certainly, two of the men who witnessed the grant to Paisley were members of monastery of Crossraguel, a religious house within the Bruce lordship of Carrick. This could be evidence that the charter was issued within the earldom as well.Murray (2002) pp. 221‚Äì222. In any event, although the precise purpose of the Turnberry pact is uncertain, it is conceivable that it was somehow connected to the Bruce faction's claim to the throne.Duffy (2013) p. 125; McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Young; Stead (2010a) p. 30; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 48; Barrow (2005) pp. 24, 429 n. 47; Oram (1992) p. 31; Reid, NH (1984) p. 57; Reid, N (1982) p. 77. One possibility is that that involvement of Clann Domhnaill may have been intended to counter the threat of Clann Dubhghaill whilst the Bruces and their allies contended with the Balliols in Galloway.Murray (2002) p. 222. In accordance to the pact, the participating Scottish magnates swore to support two prominent Anglo-Irish magnates: Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster and Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond. Thomas' father-in-law died the same year leaving him with claims in Connacht and Ulster.Duffy (2013) pp. 128‚Äì131; √ì Cl√©irigh (2008); Hartland (2007) pp. 341 fig. 2, 343; Frame (2005); √ì Cl√©irigh (2005); Duffy (2004); Frame (2004); Duffy (1993) p. 152. This could indicate that one of the purposes of the bond was to further the ambitions of Richard and Thomas in north-west Ireland, and enable the latter to secure possession of his northern inheritance from the clutches of his chief competitor, John fitz Thomas, and the numerous native kindreds of the region.Duffy (2013) p. 131; Hartland (2007) p. 343; Duffy (2004); Duffy (1993) pp. 152‚Äì153. One aspect of the pact, therefore, could have concerned the curtailment of overseas connections between Clann Domhnaill and Irish kindreds opposed to the earl, such as the U√≠ Domhnaill and the U√≠ N√©ill.Penman, M (2014) p. 26; Penman, MA (2014) p. 63; Brown, M (2004) p. 256; Blakely (2003) p. 110 n. 55. In fact, the bond coincided with an immense show of force by Richard in Connacht and Ulster. This campaign saw the earl's exaction of hostages from Cine√°l Chonaill and Cine√°l Eoghain, the deposition of Domhnall √ì N√©ill from the kingship of T√≠r Chonaill, and the subsequent replacement of the latter with a more palatable candidate.Penman, M (2014) p. 342 n. 76; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 63‚Äì64 n. 3; Duffy (2013) p. 132; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1286.2; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1286.2; Duffy (2005); Simms (2005); Duffy (2004). The bond's Anglo-Irish cosignatories may have sought maritime support from Clann Domhnaill,Oram (1992) p. 31. and it is possible that Aonghus M√≥r contributed to the earl's operation.Duffy (2013) p. 132. James Stewart,Hewison (1895) p. 58 fig. 2. one of the cosignatories of the Turnberry Band, and Alasdair √ìg's sometime opponent. Other cosignatories included members of the Stewart/Menteith kindred. The Bruces and Stewarts also had a stake in north-west Ireland, with the latter kindred eventually possessing claims to territories that had formerly been held by predecessors of John Balliol.Duffy (2013) pp. 133‚Äì135. The participation of the Stewart/Menteith kindred in the band could have also concerned its part in the hostile annexation of the Clann Suibhne lordship in Argyll. Forced from its Scottish homeland, Clann Suibhne evidently found a safe haven in T√≠r Chonaill on account of an alliance forged with Domhnall √ìg.Duffy (2013) pp. 131‚Äì132. Not only was the latter's son and successor, Aodh, the product of a union with a member of Clann Suibhne,Duffy (2013) pp. 131‚Äì132; Simms (2008) pp. 166, 171 fig. 1; Nicholls (2007) p. 93, 93 n. 49; Duffy (2002) p. 61; Simms (2000a) p. 122; Duffy (1993) p. 153; Walsh (1938) p. 377. but Domhnall √ìg himself had been fostered by the kindred.Duffy (2013) p. 131; Simms (2008) p. 166; Duffy (2007) p. 20; Simms (2007) p. 107; Parkes (2006) p. 368 n. 19; McLeod (2005) pp. 42‚Äì43; Duffy (1993) pp. 127, 153; McKenna (1946) pp. 40, 42 ¬ß 22, 44 ¬ß 22. The fact that Murchadh Mac Suibhne is known to have died imprisoned by Richard's father could in turn indicate that the earls of Ulster were opposed to Clann Suibhne's resettlement in the region.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1267.2; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1267.2; Duffy (2013) p. 132; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1267.3; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1267.3; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß¬ß 1265.15, 1267.2; Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Simms (2007) p. 107; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß¬ß 1265.15, 1267.2. Clann Domhnaill's part in Aodh's 1290 defeat at the hands of his paternal half-brother, Toirdhealbhach, meant that the forces of Clann Domhnaill were engaged supporting the cause of Aonghus M√≥r's maternal grandson (Toirdhealbhach) against a maternal descendant of Clann Suibhne (Aodh). Whether this clash was a direct result of the bond is uncertain, although it seems likely that Aonghus M√≥r's part in the pact concerned the value of his kindred's military might.Duffy (2013) pp. 132‚Äì133. Alasdair √ìg may well have overseen Clann Domhnaill's overseas support of Toirdhealbhach. =Under the Balliol regime= The seal of John, King of Scotland,Birch (1905) pp. 34‚Äì36, 127 pl. 16. a monarch closely connected with Alasdair √ìg's neighbouring rival, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill. By the death of Alexander III, the Clann Domhnaill holdings seem to have included Kintyre, Islay, southern Jura, and perhaps Colonsay and Oronsay.McDonald (2006) p. 77; McDonald (1997) p. 130. Whilst Aonghus M√≥r is regularly described with a patronymic referring to his father, Alasdair √ìg and Aonghus √ìg tend to be accorded the territorial designation \\"of Islay\\".McDonald (1997) p. 130. In 1292, the English Crown granted Aonghus M√≥r and Alasdair √ìg safe conduct to travel and trade between Scotland and Ireland.Cameron (2014) p. 152; Sellar (2000) p. 208; McDonald (1997) p. 154; Duffy (1993) pp. 164‚Äì165; Rixson (1982) p. 32; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) p. 489; Calendar of the Patent Rolls (1895) p. 52; Bain (1884) p. 148 ¬ß 635; Sweetman (1879) p. 495 ¬ß 1137; Stevenson, J (1870a) p. 337 ¬ß 276. 1292 is also the year in which a violent feud between Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill is first attested. The infighting appears to have stemmed from Alasdair √ìg's marriage to an apparent member of Clann Dubhghaill, and seems to have concerned a dispute over this woman's territorial claims.Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 52; Brown, M (2011) p. 16; McDonald (2006) p. 78; Barrow (2005) pp. 75‚Äì76, 437 n. 10; Brown, M (2004) p. 258, 258 n. 1; McQueen (2002) p. 110; Murray (2002) p. 222, 228 n. 19; Sellar (2000) p. 212, 212 n. 128; McDonald (1997) pp. 163‚Äì164; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Lamont (1981) pp. 160, 162‚Äì163; Bain (1884) p. 145 ¬ß 621; Rymer; Sanderson (1816) p. 761; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) p. 21; Document 3/33/0 (n.d.). The parentage of Alasdair √ìg's wife, Juliana, is unknown. Whilst she could have been a daughter or sister of the Clann Dubhghaill chief Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill,Barrow (2005) p. 76; Sellar (2004a); Murray (2002) p. 222, 228 n. 18; Sellar (2000) pp. 194 tab. ii, 212 n. 128; McDonald (1997) pp. 163‚Äì164; Rixson (1982) pp. 14 fig. 1, 19, 208 n. 5; Lamont (1981) pp. 162‚Äì163. she certainly possessed a claim to a portion of Lismore.Sellar (2000) p. 212 n. 128. Although Aonghus M√≥r, Alasdair √ìg, and Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, swore to Edward I, King of England that they would postpone the feud, and pledged to uphold the peace in the \\"isles and outlying territories\\", the bitter internecine struggle continued throughout the 1290s.Holton (2017) p. 149; Cameron (2014) p. 152; Brown, M (2011) p. 16, 16 n. 70; Barrow (2005) pp. 75‚Äì76, 437 n. 10; Brown, M (2004) p. 258; McQueen (2002) p. 110; Sellar (2000) p. 212; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 489‚Äì490; Bain (1884) p. 145 ¬ß¬ß 621‚Äì623; Rymer; Sanderson (1816) p. 761; Document 3/31/0 (n.d.a); Document 3/31/0 (n.d.b); Document 3/33/0 (n.d.). Edward directed that two of the Guardians of Scotland to be guarantors of the peace. One was the steward, whilst the other was John Comyn II, Lord of Badenoch. The fact that the latter was a brother-in-law of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill could indicate that the steward and Clann Domhnaill were politically aligned.Brown, M (2011) p. 16 n. 70; Bain (1884) p. 145 ¬ß 621; Rymer; Sanderson (1816) p. 761; Document 3/33/0 (n.d.). In February 1293, at the first parliament of John, King of Scotland, three new sheriffdoms were erected in the western reaches of the realm.Cameron (2014) p. 152; Penman, M (2014) p. 38; Petre, JS (2014) pp. 270‚Äì272; Watson (2013) ch. 1 ¬∂ 43; Brown, M (2011) p. 15, 15 n. 68; Young; Stead (2010b) pp. 43, 53; Boardman, S (2006) p. 12; Murray (2002) p. 222; McDonald (1997) pp. 131‚Äì134; Watson (1991) pp. 29 n. 27, 241, 248‚Äì249; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 114, 148 n. 16, 413; Macphail (1916) p. 115; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 447; RPS, 1293/2/16 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/16 (n.d.b); RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.b); RPS, 1293/2/18 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/18 (n.d.b). In the north-west, William II, Earl of Ross was made Sheriff of Skye, with a jurisdiction that appears to correspond to the territories formerly held by the Crovan dynasty before 1266. In the central-west, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill was made Sheriff of Lorn, with a jurisdiction over much of Argyll. In the south-west, the steward was made Sheriff of Kintyre.Holton (2017) p. 151; Young; Stead (2010a) p. 40; Young; Stead (2010b) pp. 43, 53; McDonald (1997) pp. 131‚Äì134; Watson (1991) pp. 248‚Äì249; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 114, 148 n. 16. The creation of these divisions dramatically evidences the steady consolidation of royal authority in the west in since 1266.Cameron (2014) p. 152; Watson (2013) ch. 1 ¬∂ 43; McDonald (1997) pp. 131‚Äì134, 163. Despite the king's intentions of increased authority, stability, and peace, his new sheriffs seem to have used their elevated positions to exploit royal power against their own local rivals. Whereas Clann Ruaidhr√≠ appears to have fallen afoul of the neighbouring Earl of Ross, Clann Domhnaill was forced to deal with its powerful Clann Dubhghaill rivals.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 50‚Äì51; Brown, M (2011) pp. 15‚Äì16; Boardman, S (2006) p. 19; Brown, M (2004) p. 258.

Like Alasdair √ìg, Alexander Stewart was employed by the English Crown against Clann Dubhghaill. Aonghus M√≥r is last attested in 1293,Murray (2002) p. 222; McDonald (1997) p. 130. and appears to have died at about this date.Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii. Alasdair √ìg's undated renewal of his father's grant of St Ciar√°n seems to be evidence that Aonghus M√≥r had been succeeded by the date of its issue.Lamont (1981) p. 160; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 13; Registrum Monasterii (1832) pp. 128‚Äì129; Document 3/31/4 (n.d.). Certainly, Alasdair √ìg appears to have succeeded Aonghus M√≥r by the mid 1290s.Brown, M (2011) p. 16; McDonald (1997) p. 159; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Lamont (1981) p. 160. The record of Alasdair √ìg serving as a young hostage in 1264 suggests that he would have been in his thirties at the time of his succession.Duffy (1991) p. 312. In an effort to curb the principal representative of the Comyn-Balliol faction in the north-west, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Edward turned to Alasdair √ìg.Penman, MA (2014) p. 64; Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 18; McNamee (2012a) ch. 3; Young; Stead (2010a) pp. 50‚Äì52; Brown, M (2004) pp. 258‚Äì259; Watson (1991) p. 243.

As such, Alasdair √ìg was given jurisdiction over an area formerly under the authority of the steward,Penman, M (2014) p. 51; Young; Stead (2010a) pp. 52‚Äì53; Young; Stead (2010b) pp. 43, 66; Watson (1991) p. 243. a man who had briefly taken up arms against the English in 1296 but quickly capitulated when resistance proved futile.Penman, M (2014) p. 51. By 10 September, however, Edward turned to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Menteith, who was appointed authority over an expansive territory stretching from Ross to Rutherglen. The earl was ordered to take into custody the property of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill and E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill;Holton (2017) p. 152; Penman, M (2014) pp. 51, 379 n. 122; Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 18; Boardman, S (2006) p. 20; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; McDonald (1997) p. 164; Duffy (1993) p. 170; Watson (1991) p. 244; Fraser (1888b) pp. xxxii ¬ß 16, 222‚Äì223 ¬ß 16; Bain (1884) p. 225 ¬ß 853; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) pp. 31‚Äì32; Document 1/27/0 (n.d.a). his was given authority over specific magnates such as the steward, (the keeper of Ross) William Hay, John Comyn II, and Niall Caimb√©al; as well as the burghs of Ayr, Renfrew, Dumbarton; and given authority over the men of Argyll and Ross.Penman, M (2014) p. 51; Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 18; Boardman, S (2006) p. 20; McDonald (1997) p. 164; Watson (1991) p. 244; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) pp. 31‚Äì32. It is unknown what prompted the king to turn towards the earl. The latter had been captured following the Scottish defeat at Dunbar in April,Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 18; Watson (1991) pp. 244, 246. and had been released from custody in June.Watson (1991) p. 244. One possibility is that the English Crown sought to rely upon a power that was less personally involved in the politics of the region. It is also possible that the English orchestrated this delegation of authority in the context of adopting a divide- and-rule policy in the region as a way to offset Alasdair √ìg's influence.Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 18; Watson (1991) p. 244. Either Skipness Castle (pictured) or Dunaverty Castle could have been the principal seat of the steward in Kintyre.Young; Stead (2010b) p. 43. Either may have been the fortress that Alasdair √ìg was on verge of storming in September 1296 when he informed the English Crown of his progress in securing control of Kintyre. In an undated letter that appears to date to about the summer of 1296, Alasdair √ìg reported to the English king that he had secured possession of the steward's lands in Kintyre, and was on verge of taking control of a particular castle.Holton (2017) p. 152; Simpson (2016) pp. 223‚Äì224; Taylor (2016) p. 267, 267 n. 6; Barrow (2005) pp. 386, 437‚Äì438 n. 11, 489 n. 119; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 183 n. 24; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; McDonald (1997) p. 166; Jones (1994) p. 169; Watson (1991) p. 243; MacQueen (1982) p. 62; Dunbar; Duncan (1971) pp. 3‚Äì5, 16‚Äì17; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) p. 152 ¬ß 152; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.e).

Alasdair √ìg also advanced the opinion that, under the Scottish and English law, no tenant-in-chief should lose his heritage without first being impleaded by writ in their name. However, the fact that Malcolm is on record in possession of Dunaverty Castle a decade later suggests that Alasdair √ìg's letter was an insincere‚Äîand unsuccessful‚Äîattempt to prevent Malcolm from gaining a foothold in Kintyre.Penman, M (2014) p. 356 n. 3; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5, 5 n. 26; McNamee (2012b) chs. 1 ¬∂ 23, 2 ¬∂ 4; Duncan (2007) p. 144 n. 659‚Äì78; Barrow (2005) pp. 191‚Äì193; 437‚Äì438 n. 11, 459 n. 9; Dunbar; Duncan (1971) pp. 4‚Äì5; Riley (1873) pp. 347‚Äì353; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.).

Whether Alasdair √ìg was aware of the steward's submition is unknown. As a result, his castle could have been seized by Alasdair √ìg or merely handed over to him.Watson (1991) p. 243. In September 1296, Edward ordered that Alasdair √ìg be granted ¬£100 of lands and rent for his services to the English Crown.Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 491‚Äì492; Calendar of the Patent Rolls (1895) p. 200; Stevenson, J (1870b) p. 101 ¬ß 390; Document 1/27/0 (n.d.b). =Clann Somhairle kin-strife= arms of the Lord of Argyll depicted in the fourteenth-century Balliol Roll.Woodcock; Flower; Chalmers et al.

It is evident that, from about 1296 to 1301, Clann Dubhghaill was out of favour of the English Crown. The efforts of Edward's adherents in Argyll were evidently successful since the next record of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill reveals that the latter had been imprisoned at some pointMcDonald (1997) p. 164.‚Äîpresumably in an attempt to pacify his familyHolton (2017) p. 152; Young; Stead (2010a) p. 52; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 69.‚Äîand was released by Edward in May 1297.Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 51; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 77; Young (1999) p. 216; McDonald (1997) p. 164; Watson (1991) p. 248; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) p. 40; Document 5/1/0 (n.d.b).

The struggle between Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill is documented in two undated letters from Alasdair √ìg to Edward. In the first, Alasdair √ìg complained to the king that Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill had ravaged his lands. Although Alasdair √ìg further noted that he had overcome Ruaidhr√≠ Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and thereby brought him to heel,Holton (2017) pp. 152‚Äì153; Barrow (2005) pp. 141, 450 n. 104; Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 56‚Äì57; Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂ 49, 2 n. 52; Barrow (2006) p. 147; Brown, M (2004) pp. 259‚Äì260; Murray (2002) p. 222; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; McDonald (1997) pp. 165, 190; Watson (1991) pp. 245‚Äì246; Rixson (1982) pp. 13‚Äì15, 208 n. 2, 208 n. 4; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 193; Bain (1884) pp. 235‚Äì236 ¬ß 904; Stevenson, J (1870b) pp. 187‚Äì188 ¬ß 444; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.b). the fealty that Ruaidhr√≠ swore to the English Crown appears to have been rendered merely as a stalling tactic,Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 56. since the letter reveals that Ruaidhr√≠'s brother, Lachlann Mac Ruaidhr√≠, then attacked Alasdair √ìg, and both of these Clann Ruaidhr√≠ brothers proceeded to ravage Skye and Lewis and Harris. At the end of the letter, Alasdair √ìg related that he was in the midst of organising a retaliatory operation, and implored upon Edward to instruct the other noblemen of Argyll and Ross to aid him in his struggle against the king's enemies. In a writ dated 9 April 1297, Edward ordered that the men of Argyll and Ross assist Alasdair √ìg, who was thereby appointed as the king's bailiff in Lorn, Ross, and the Hebrides.Young; Stead (2010a) p. 52; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 69; Murray (2002) p. 228 n. 24; Watson (1991) pp. 243, 246; Reid, NH (1984) p. 161; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) p. 491; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) p. 40; Document 5/1/0 (n.d.a). As such, Alasdair √ìg was granted authority in Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill's former sheriffdom.Young; Stead (2010a) p. 52; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 69; Watson (1991) p. 243. If the royal command was a response to Alasdair √ìg's letter, as seems the case, it would suggest that he composed his correspondence to the king in the midpart of March.Watson (1991) p. 246. Now- ruinous Inverlochy Castle was once a stronghold of the Comyn kindred. In 1297, Alasdair √ìg pursued his opponents to the castle, where he attempted to capture the largest warships on the western seaboard. In the second letter, Alasdair √ìg again appealed to the English Crown, complaining that he faced a united front from Donnchadh, Lachlann, Ruaidhr√≠, and the Comyns. According Alasdair √ìg, the men of Lochaber had sworn allegiance to Lachlann and Donnchadh. In one instance Alasdair √ìg reported that, although he had been able to force Lachlann's supposed submission, he was thereupon attacked by Ruaidhr√≠. Alasdair √ìg further related a specific expedition in which he pursued his opponents to the Comyn stronghold of Inverlochy CastleCochran-Yu (2015) pp. 56‚Äì57, 60; Watson (2013) ch. 2 ¬∂¬∂ 49‚Äì51, 2 n. 52; Brown, M (2009) pp. 10‚Äì11; James (2009) p. 87; Barrow (2005) p. 141, 450 n. 104; Fisher (2005) p. 93; Barrow; Royan (2004) pp. 168, 177; Brown, M (2004) p. 260; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; Sellar (2000) p. 212; Traquair (1998) p. 68; McDonald (1997) pp. 154, 165; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 286 ¬ß 130; Watson (1991) pp. 246‚Äì249, 297; Rixson (1982) pp. 15‚Äì16, 208 n. 4, 208 n. 6; Barrow (1980) pp. 69, 69 n. 51, 138 n. 105; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 193; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 492‚Äì494; Bain (1884) p. 235 ¬ß 903; Stevenson, J (1870b) pp. 189‚Äì191 ¬ß 445; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.c).‚Äîthe principal fortress in LochaberYoung; Stead (2010a) pp. 24, 102.‚Äîwhere he was unable to capture‚Äîbut nevertheless destroyed‚Äîtwo massive galleys which he described as the largest warships in the Western Isles. Alasdair √ìg also reported that, on account of the steward's disloyalty to the king, he seized control of the castle and barony of \\"'\\" (probably Glassary). There is only one other reference to a castle in the barony of Glassary‚Äîpresumably Fincharn Castle‚Äîin 1374.Watson (1991) p. 248 n. 21; Macphail (1916) pp. 148‚Äì151, 149 n. 1. How the steward came to hold any authority in these Argyllian lands is uncertain. One possibility is that he capitalised upon the conflict between Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill.Watson (2013) ch. 2 n. 54; Watson (1991) p. 248 n. 21. In any event, much like in the first letter, Alasdair √ìg called upon the English king for financial support in combating his mounting opponents. Specifically, he reminded the English Crown that he had received nothing of the ¬£500 that he had been promised the year before, nor had he received any revenue from his duties as bailiff. The seal that Alasdair √ìg's English overlord, Edward I, used in Scotland in 1296‚Äì1306.Birch (1905) pp. 38‚Äì39, 133 pl. 19. Alasdair √ìg's dispatches seem to show that Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠ were focused upon seizing control of Skye and Lewis and Harris from the absentee Earl of Ross. Whilst the first communiqu√© reveals that the initial assault upon the islands concerned pillage, the second letter appears to indicate that the islands were subjected to further invasions by Clann Ruaidhr√≠, suggesting that the acquisition of these islands was the family's goal. The bitter strife between Clann Ruaidhr√≠ and Clann Domhnaill depicted by these letters seems to indicate that both kindreds sought to capitalise on the earl's absence, and that both families sought to incorporate the islands into their own lordships. In specific regard to Clann Ruaidhr√≠, it is likely this kindred's campaigning was an extension of the conflict originating from the creation of the shrievalty of Skye.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 57, 95‚Äì96. The correspondence also reveals that the Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠ were able to split their forces and operate somewhat independently of each other. Although Alasdair √ìg was evidently able to overcome one of the brothers at a time, he was nevertheless vulnerable to a counterattack from the other.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 57‚Äì58. Alasdair √ìg's second letter appears to date to after his reception of the king's writ of 9 April.Watson (1991) pp. 247, 249. Whether the Clann Somhairle kin-strife continued after Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill's May release is uncertain, although it would seem highly probable given the remarkable animosity between the concerned parties.Watson (1991) pp. 248‚Äì249. If Edward did not intend for this liberated clan chief to reign in his family, another possibility is that his release was instead envisaged as a counterbalance to Alasdair √ìg's power, to ensure that the latter was kept in check.Watson (1991) p. 254 n. 52, 388. The correspondence between Alasdair √ìg and the English also reveals that, notwithstanding Edward's 1296 grant of administrative powers to Alexander Stewart in the northwest, it was actually Alasdair √ìg who was implementing English royal authority in the region.Watson (1991) pp. 249, 252, 269, 406. Nevertheless, although Alasdair √ìg was ostensibly working on the king's behalf, it is evident that local rivalries and self-interest laid behind the region's political alignments, not anti-Englishness.Watson (1991) pp. 242, 249, 262. Certainly, the English Crown's elevation of Alasdair √ìg at the expense of the steward and Clann Dubhghaill would have been a cause of apprehension and resentment.Young; Stead (2010a) pp. 50‚Äì53; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 69. In fact, it is apparent that little authority could be expected by Edward without bringing these two disaffected parties onside.Watson (1991) p. 249. =Death= Alasdair √ìg's apparent name as it appears on folio 71v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1295.1; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1295.1; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). The excerpt forms part of the annal-entry recording his death at the hands of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill. In 1299, several Irish annals report a clash between Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill in which Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill slew a member of Clann Domhnaill named Alasdair.Holton (2017) p. 152, 152 n. 116; Brown, M (2004) p. 260; Murray (2002) p. 223; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 61; Sellar (2000) pp. 212‚Äì213; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; McDonald (1997) pp. 168‚Äì169; Duffy (1993) p. 174; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Alexander mac Domhnaill (n.d.); Alexander mac Dubghaill and Alexander mac Domhnaill (n.d.); Alexander mac Dubghaill (n.d.). According to the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, this man was \\"the best man of his tribe in Ireland and Scotland for hospitality and prowess\\"; whilst the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster states that he was killed \\"together with a countless number of his own people ... around him\\".Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1295.1; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1295.1; Sellar (2000) pp. 212‚Äì213; McDonald (1997) p. 168; AU, 129/9, p. 393 (n.d.); AU, 1295/9, p. 393 (n.d.). The slain man appears to have been Alasdair √ìg himself.Sellar (2016) p. 104; Addyman; Oram (2012) ¬ß 2.3; Barrow (2006) p. 147; Barrow (2005) p. 211; Brown, M (2004) p. 77 tab. 4.1; Sellar (2004a); Murray (2002); Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 61; Sellar (2000) pp. 212‚Äì213; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; McDonald (1997) pp. 168‚Äì169, 168‚Äì169 n. 36; Duffy (1991) p. 312 n. 52; Lamont (1981) p. 168. The accounts of his demise suggest that his final fall took place in the context of his ongoing dispute with Clann Dubhghaill.McDonald (1997) p. 169. If the seventeenth-century Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells is to be believed, Clann Dubhghaill successfully dispatched another rival during the 1290s, as this source claims that E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill overcame and slew Cail√©an M√≥r Caimb√©al.Addyman; Oram (2012) ¬ß 2.3; Boardman, S (2006) p. 21; Sellar (2004a); Sellar (2004b); Murray (2002) p. 228 n. 21; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 52‚Äì53; Sellar (2000) p. 212, 212 n. 130; McDonald (1997) p. 165, 165 n. 22; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1975) p. 118 ¬ß 227; Macphail (1916) pp. 84‚Äì85, 85 n. 1. The latter's death took place after his recognition as bailiff of Loch Awe and Ardscotnish by Edward in September 1296, suggesting that he too was employed by the English against Clann Dubhghaill.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 20‚Äì21, 33 n. 67; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) pp. 92, 121‚Äì122; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) pp. 31‚Äì32. Accordingly, both Alasdair √ìg and Cail√©an M√≥r appear to have succumbed to Clann Dubhghaill whilst attempting to extend Edward's authority into Argyll and bring the clan to heel.James (2009) p. 106; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 20‚Äì21, 37. The Dublin city seal of 1297.Rixson (1982) pl. 4; Brindley (1913). The Clann Domhnaill seals show no trace of the forecastle and aftercastle depicted upon this device, indicating that the galleys utilised by the Highlanders and Hebrideans were smaller than vessels used elsewhere in Britain and Ireland.Rixson (1982) p. 130. Alasdair √ìg's death in 1299 seems to account for the recorded actions of his younger brother, Aonghus √ìg, against Clann Dubhghaill. In either 1301 or 1310 for example, whilst in the service of the English Crown, Aonghus √ìg inquired of the king as to whether he and Hugh were authorised to conduct military operations against Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, and further entreated the king on behalf of Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠‚Äîwho were then aiding Aonghus √ìg's English-aligned military forces‚Äîto grant the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ brothers feu of their ancestral lands.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 59; Cameron (2014) p. 153; Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Barrow (2005) pp. 217, 450 n. 104; Murray (2002) p. 223; McDonald (1997) pp. 167, 169, 190‚Äì191; Duffy (1993) pp. 202‚Äì203, 203 n. 49, 206; Watson (1991) pp. 256, 271; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 6; Lamont (1981) pp. 161, 164; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Reid, WS (1960) pp. 10‚Äì11; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß 1254; Stevenson, J (1870b) p. 436 ¬ß 615; Document 3/31/0 (n.d.c).

The fact that Aonghus √ìg styled himself \\"of Islay\\" in his letter could be evidence that he was acting as chief of Clann Domhnaill, and that he succeeded Alasdair √ìg as chief.McDonald (1997) p. 171. Nevertheless, the precise succession of Clann Domhnaill is uncertain. For example, the record of a certain Domhnall in attendance of the 1309 parliament of Robert I, with the territorial designation \\"of Islay\\", could indicate that this particular man then held the chiefship.Penman, MA (2014) p. 68; Sellar (2016) p. 104; Barrow (2005) p. 240; Lamont (1981) pp. 165, 167; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 459; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.a); RPS, 1309/1 (n.d.a); RPS, 1309/1 (n.d.b). As with the succession, the identity of this man is uncertain. One possibility is that he was an elder brother of Aonghus √ìg;Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68, 68 n. 17; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Barrow (2005) p. 211; Murray (2002) p. 228 n. 32; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Duffy (1991) p. 311; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 282‚Äì283 n. 10; Lamont (1981) p. 165. other possibilities are that he was either a cousin of Alasdair √ìg and Aonghus √ìg,Penman, M (2014) pp. 102, 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 17; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188; Duffy (1991) pp. 311‚Äì312; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 279 tab. 1, 282‚Äì283 n. 10. or else a son of either two.Penman, M (2014) p. 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188. The name and title of a Clann Domhnaill dynast as they appear on folio 82v (part 2) of Royal Irish Academy P 6 (the Annals of the Four Masters).Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1318.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1318.5; Royal Irish Academy (n.d.). The annal-entry records this man's death in 1318 at Faughart. He could have been a son of Alasdair √ìg, and appears to have occupied the chiefship at the time of his fall. Further evidence of a contentious family succession may be the record of a certain Alasdair of the Isles,Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68. who received a grant of the former Clann Dubhghaill islands of Mull and Tiree from Robert I.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 66, 67‚Äì68; McNamee (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Boardman, S (2006) p. 45; Barrow (2005) p. 378; Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Murray (2002) p. 224; McDonald (1997) p. 184, 184 n. 104; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 77; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 553 ¬ß 653. This man could have been a son of Aonghus √ìg,Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68; Boardman, S (2006) p. 45; Murray (2002) p. 224; McDonald (1997) p. 184; Duffy (1991) p. 312 n. 52; Lamont (1981) pp. 168‚Äì169; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. or else a nephew of the latterBarrow (2005) p. 378; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 41; Lamont (1981) p. 168.‚Äîpresumably a son of Alasdair √ìg himself.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68; Murray (2002) p. 224. Certainly, Alasdair of the Isles's royal grant comprised former Clann Dubhghaill islands, a fact which could be evidence that he was indeed a son of Alasdair √ìg, and possessed a claim to these territories by right of his maternal descent from Clann Dubhghaill.Murray (2002) p. 224. Remarkably, this is no evidence of a royal charter to the lordship of Islay. This could reveal that, upon Alasdair √ìg's death, the lordship was automatically inherited by a son, possibly Alasdair of the Isles.Murray (2002) pp. 223‚Äì224. The latter may be identical to the apparent Clann Domhnaill chief slain in 1318 supporting the Bruce campaign in Ireland. The sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√© records his name as \\"'\\".Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1318.7; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1318.7; Barrow (2005) p. 488 n. 104; Caldwell, DH (2004) p. 72; McDonald (1997) p. 191. This source is mirrored by several other Irish annals,Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Barrow (2005) pp. 466 n. 15, 488 n. 104; Boardman, SI (2004); McLeod (2002) p. 31, 31 n. 24; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 77; Sellar (2000) p. 217 n. 155; Davies (2000) p. 175 n. 14; Roberts (1999) p. 181; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; Duffy (1998) pp. 79, 102; Duffy (1993) pp. 206‚Äì207; Lydon (1992) p. 5; Lamont (1981) p. 166; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Dundalk (n.d.); Mac Ruaidhri, King of the Hebrides (n.d.); Mac Domhnaill, King of Argyll (n.d.). and the eleventh- to fourteenth- century Annals of Inisfallen seems to refer to the same man, calling him \\"Alexander M\\" in an only partially-decipherable entry.Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1318.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1318.4; Murray (2002) pp. 224, 229 n. 42; Duffy (1998) p. 79; McDonald (1997) pp. 186‚Äì187, 187 n. 112; Duffy (1991) p. 312, 312 n. 51; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. The albeit exaggerated title \\"King of Argyll\\" accorded to this slain Clann Domhnaill dynast appears to exemplify the catastrophic effect that the rise of the Bruce regime had on its opponents like Clann Dubhghaill.McNamee (2012a) ch. 8; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 65; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 77; Duffy (1993) p. 207. Until its downfall in 1309, Clann Dubhghaill was closely associated with the lordship of Argyll.McLeod (2002) p. 39 n. 52; Murray (2002) p. 224; Munro; Munro (1986) p. lxi. In consequence, this Argyllian title could be evidence that a son of Alasdair √ìg possessed the inheritance of both Clann Domhnaill and Clann Dubhghaill. Descendants The partially-decipherable name of \\"Alexander M\\" as it appears on folio 57r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 503 (the Annals of Inisfallen).Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1318.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1318.4; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 503 (n.d.). This man was slain campaigning in Ireland in 1318, and appears to have been chief of Clann Domhnaill. He could be identical to Alasdair of the Isles, and a son of Alasdair √ìg. Alasdair √ìg is the eponymous ancestor of the Clann Alasdair branch of Clann Domhnaill.Murray (2002) p. 221. Surviving genealogical sources reveal that he had at least six sons:Murray (2002) p. 223; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii. E√≥in Dubh, Raghnall, Toirdhealbhach, Aonghus, Gofraidh, and Somhairle.Murray (2002) p. 223. Following his death, Alasdair √ìg's sons evidently established themselves as gallowglass commanders in Ireland.Petre, J (2015) p. 606; Nicholls (2005); Murray (2002) p. 223; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5. In fact, three are recorded as commanders in contemporary Irish annalistic sources, and all founded prominent Irish gallowglass families. As such, Alasdair √ìg's descendants formed the major gallowglass families of Clann Domhnaill.Sellar (2016) p. 104; Caldwell, D (2008) p. 56; Nicholls (2007) p. 97; Boardman, S (2006). The first to be recorded in such a capacity is E√≥in Dubh, a man whose violent demise is reported in 1349.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1349.2; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1349.2; Nicholls (2007) p. 97; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1346.1; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1346.1; Nicholls (2005); Murray (2002) p. 223. The name of Alasdair √ìg's son, E√≥in Dubh, as it appears on folio 76v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489.Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1346.1; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1346.1; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). E√≥in Dubh's son, Somhairle, was Constable of Ulster, and was described as heir to the kingship of the Hebrides in 1365.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1365.8; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1365.8; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 223, 225. E√≥in Dubh's brother, Raghnall, was described as heir of Clann Alasdair in 1366.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1366.9; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1366.9; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1366.11; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1366.11; Nicholls (2007) p. 98; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1363.3; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 226; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1363.3. Other than Alasdair of the Isles, another possible son of Alasdair √ìg is Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay,Petre, JS (2014) pp. 272, 268 tab.; McQueen (2002) p. 287 n. 18; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 224; McDonald (1997) p. 187. a man who suffered the forfeiture of his possessions by Robert I in 1325.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75, 74‚Äì75 n. 42; Petre, JS (2014) p. 272; Barrow (2005) p. 389; Brown, M (2004) p. 267 n. 18; McQueen (2002) p. 287; Murray (2002) p. 224; Roberts (1999) p. 181; McDonald (1997) p. 187; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 12; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 557 ¬ß 699; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 483; RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.a); RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.b).

The downfall of Alasdair √ìg's lineage in the Clann Domhnaill heartland seems to account for the kindred's relocation to Ireland as mercenary commanders. If Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay was indeed a member of Clann Domhnaill, and a son of Alasdair √ìg, his expulsion may have marked the downfall of Clann Alasdair in Scotland, and may account for the fact that Alasdair √ìg's descendants failed to hold power in Hebrides after this date. As such, Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay's expulsion could well mark the date upon which Clann Alasdair relocated overseas.Murray (2002) p. 224; Petre, JS (2014) pp. 272‚Äì273. Another family descended from Alasdair √ìg is probably Clann Alasdair of Loup in Kintyre.Sellar (2016) p. 104; Nicholls (2007) p. 98; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 61. The eclipse of Alasdair √ìg's line‚Äîthe senior branch of Clann Domhnaill‚Äîmay explain the rise of Aonghus √ìg's line. If Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay indeed represented the line of Alasdair √ìg by 1325, his forfeiture evidently paved the way for the rise of Aonghus √ìg's son, E√≥in.Petre, JS (2014) pp. 272‚Äì273; Murray (2002) p. 224. In fact, before the end of Robert I's reign, this E√≥in appears to have administered Islay on behalf of the Scottish Crown,Murray (2002) p. 225; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 286. and eventually came to style himself Lord of the Isles.Petre, JS (2014) p. 272; Murray (2002) pp. 225, 230 n. 59; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 286. The name of Alasdair √ìg's like-named grandson, Alasdair √ìg mac Toirdhealbhaigh, as it appears on folio 78v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489.Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1365.9; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1365.9; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). This man was Constable of Ulster, and was described as heir of Clann Domhnaill.Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1368.13; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1368.13; Murray (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 225. The traditional account of Alasdair √ìg, preserved by seventeenth-century Sleat History, has little in common with the man recorded by contemporary accounts.Murray (2002) p. 226; Lamont (1981) pp. 161‚Äì162. For example, according to the Sleat History, Alasdair √ìg was \\"always\\" an enemy of Robert I, and consistently fought alongside E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill against this king. At one point, Alasdair √ìg is said to have been besieged by the king within Castle Sween, where he was captured and later died there as a prisoner, after which Aonghus √ìg‚Äîsaid to have \\"always\\" supported Robert I in \\"all his wars\\"‚Äîwas awarded with Alasdair √ìg's lands.Penman, M (2014) p. 358 n. 68; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68‚Äì69 n. 20; Murray (2002) p. 226; Lamont (1981) pp. 161‚Äì162; Macphail (1914) pp. 13‚Äì16. This skewed view of Alasdair √ìg seems to have been constructed as a means to glorify the branch of Clann Domhnaill descended from Aonghus √ìg at the expense of Alasdair √ìg and his reputation. As such, the history of the Clann Alasdair branch of the clan is ignored by the Sleat History.Murray (2002) pp. 226‚Äì227.

Generally, these shows would gravely discuss the \\"problem\\" of homosexuality with a panel of \\"experts\\" on the subject, none of whom were identified as homosexual. These included such programs as Confidential File out of Los Angeles, which produced \\"Homosexuals and the Problems They Present\\" in 1954Tropiano, p. 269 and \\"Homosexuals Who Stalk and Molest Our Children\\" in 1955,Tropiano, p. 3 and The Open Mind out of New York which aired \\"Introduction to the Problem of Homosexuality\\", \\"Homosexuality: A Psychological Approach\\" and \\"Male and Female in American Society\\" during its 1956‚Äì1957 season.Tropiano, p. 4 One notable exception to this rule was Showcase, hosted out of New York by author Fannie Hurst beginning in 1958. Showcase presented several of the earliest well- rounded discussions of homosexuality and was one of the few programs on which homosexual men spoke for themselves rather than being debated by a panel of \\"experts\\".Tropiano, pp. 4‚Äì5 Hurst was praised by early homophile group the Mattachine Society, which invited Hurst to deliver the keynote address at the Society's 1958 convention. A brief break from this pattern came in 1961 with the production of The Rejected, the first documentary program on homosexuality aired on American television.Alwood, p. 41 The Rejected presented information on such topics as the Kinsey Reports and featured anthropologist Margaret Mead discussing homosexuality in ancient Greece and among Native American cultures. A representative from the Mattachine Society also appeared on-air. However, the old model quickly re-emerged with such broadcasts as \\"Society and the Homosexual\\" in 1962 from the Los Angeles-based Argument and Chicago's Off the Cuff, which in 1963 presented a discussion of lesbianism with an all-male panel.Tropiano, p. 7 CBS became the first national network to broadcast a documentary hour, in 1967. CBS Reports: The Homosexuals featured men interviewed in shadow and from behind potted plants to conceal their identities and anti-gay psychologists Charles W. Socarides and Irving Bieber in a broadcast that has been described as \\"the single most destructive hour of antigay propaganda in our nation's history\\".Besen, p. 128 During the 1960s, a few fiction series broached the subject obliquely, with \\"coded\\" or repressed lesbians like Miss Brant from 1961's The Asphalt Jungle or discussion of characters who may or may not have been gay like Channing's Buddy Crown in 1963. Those episodes that featured identified lesbian or gay characters tended to present them as either victims or killers. Following the 1969 Stonewall riots, a seminal event in the American gay rights movement, gay activist groups began speaking out more forcefully, challenging how homosexuality was portrayed on-screen.

Biography Peterson's birth name is Kalerthon Demetro. He was born in Chicago in 1998. Despite claiming to be incel, Peterson has stated that he has had a girlfriend in the past, yet claims it was not a productive relationship. By Peterson's own admission he hacked his girlfriend's emails, distributed revenge porn of her, and was attacked by her after traveling to her city of residence unannounced and repeatedly attempting to contact her. Peterson first stumbled upon the manosphere at the age of 11 on 4chan. A psychiatrist has diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, but this has been disputed by other doctors. He is a high school dropout. Peterson directed an experimental film, Sawgrass, which was released in 2019. After finishing the screenplay for Sawgrass, he was given career advice and motivation to complete the film from Bob Odenkirk and Ken Levine. Eric Paddock, the brother of the Las Vegas shooter, was befriended by Peterson and interviewed in Sawgrass. Aaron Fechter, the creator of The Rock-afire Explosion, also made an appearance in the film. Peterson was reported missing in December 2019, but was quickly located. Activism Peterson is a former staff member and chat room administrator of Incels.me, which is the largest incel website on the internet, a site he describes as more honest than other incel forums. He previously ran the \\"Incelcast\\", wherein he interviewed incels and discussed how they came to their position. His podcast also discussed the hikikomori phenomenon in Japan and the likelihood of the same thing happening in the Western world. He has been the subject of television and phone interviews with the media to discuss incel topics. Peterson was the only incel to be featured on Canadian national television in the aftermath of the Toronto terrorist van attack. He believes that involuntary celibacy is a social phenomenon rather than a movement and has described online communities as support groups for discussing depression and loneliness.Mountford, J. B. \\"Topic Modeling The Red Pill.\\" Social Sciences 7.3 (2018): 42. Peterson describes incels as commonly being males in their late teens who are shy. Peterson has compared the demonization of inceldom to the generalizations and subsequent xenophobic and Islamophobic sentiments faced by Muslims in the aftermath of Islamist violence. In May 2018, Peterson announced on his YouTube channel that he left the incel community voluntarily by requesting a permanent ban on the forum \\"Incels.me\\". He appeared on Invisibilia in April 2019 claiming he was not actually ideologically reformed, but was attempting to outwardly change in whatever way he could to \\"make my life not horrible\\". Peterson still displays images of himself with popular Men's Rights Activists. Peterson made an appearance on ABC News Nightline in August 2019, discussing his departure from the incel community.

History It was originally developed at Tulane University in 1956, and then commercialized by the Kalvar Corporation starting the next year. It was originally intended to make copying microfilm simpler, but also found a number of other uses. As the document processing world moved to computerized records, Kalvar was no longer in demand, and vesicular microfilm is now only made upon request. Kalvar was intended to be used primarily for document storage, copying microfilm or microfiche. In this use the unexposed Kalvar was placed back-to-back with the original, and exposed to collimated UV light. The two films were then separated and the Kalvar run over a heated drum to develop and fix the image. The physical robustness of the Mylar base was an advantage, allowing it to be handled far longer than conventional silver-halide films of the era (early 1960s). The ease of copying also suggested its use in the distribution of movies, and in 1961 Kalvar and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer formed a joint venture, \\"Metro Kalvar\\", to market a system for copying 16 mm and 35 mm black-and-white motion pictures.\\"The IPTE Exhibition: Metro Kalvar\\", The British Journal of Photography, 26 November 1965 Both film sizes were commonly used for microfilm already, development was primary machinery related. Kalvar film was limited to reproduction of black and white only although a color process was developed. The color process used entirely too much light to be an economic success and never became commercially available. Kalvar Corp was not the only company to commercially develop the process. In California, Xidex Corporation developed a similar process and filed a patent on it in the late 1950s. This eventually led to Xidex suing Kalvar for patent infringement, but when Kalvar demonstrated that they had been shipping commercial versions of their film in 1957, over a year before the Xidex filing, Xidex lost the suit.\\"Kalvar Corporation, Plaintiff- Appellant, v. Xidex Corporation, Defendant-Appellee\\", 556 F.2d 966 (9th Cir. 1977) After losing, Xidex simply purchased Kalvar outright. This led to an antitrust suit being filed by the Federal Trade Commission in 1981, and Xidex agreed to sell off the entire Kalvar side of their business (they had several others) in 1983,David Barton and Roger Sherman, \\"The Price Profit Effects of Horizontal Merger, a case study\\", Journal of Industrial Economics, Volume 33(2) (1984), pg. 165‚Äì177 which failed soon after. Description Kalvar film consisted of a diazo compound, diazonium salt, suspended in a saran plastic film. When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light one of the chemical bonds in the diazo is broken, leaving an isolated nitrogen molecule. The plastic softens when heated, allowing the nitrogen to collect into tiny bubbles, the \\"vesicles\\". When the film cools again, the bubbles are trapped in place. The bubbles strongly scatter light, making them appear white in reflected light, but opaque when backlit. Since the bubbles form where the UV light went through the original, the copy is a negative.Robert T. Nieset, \\"The Basis of the Kalvar System of Photography\\", Journal of Photographic Science, Volume 10 (1962), pg. 188 Because the film was sensitive to UV only, it could be easily handled under normal incandescent lamps with no need for a darkroom, although for archival storage it was placed in UV-protective boxes. The developed film could be stabilized or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by overall re-exposure to UV light which would destroy the remaining diazonium compound which remained in the un-exposed areas. In this case, the exposure would not be followed by heat ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and the nitrogen thus created would eventually diffuse into the atmosphere without creating bubbles. This left an inert negative vesicular image simply composed of nitrogen filled bubbles in a relatively stable plastic. A direct positive print could be made by using a much more gas permeable matrix which, after initial exposure, allowed the nitrogen in the exposed areas to quickly diffuse out into the atmosphere without bubble development. This would be followed by a quick overall re-exposure of the film to a high powered xenon flash lamp which would disrupt the remaining unexposed diazonium sensitizer. The flash would simultaneously heat the plastic matrix to cause bubble formation before the nitrogen molecules could diffuse out. This created a direct positive image when viewed in transmission and a negative image when viewed in reflected light. In the production process, a solution of Saran dissolved in an organic solvent and containing a small amount of a diazo compound was coated onto a substrate of Mylar. The film was then run through a drying oven to drive off the solvents. The film at this point was clear with a yellow cast from the diazo. In a second process called ‚Äúcycling,‚Äù it was run through a tank of very hot water which created a fog of small holes in the Saran layer. This very greatly increased the photographic speed (light sensitivity) of the film. Several different formulations were in commercial use designed to optimize different photographic parameters for various customers. The film was remarkably durable and indeed trying to effectively destroy the image was a serious problem when sensitive material needed to be destroyed. Simply heating the film damaged the image, eventually, but usually left it largely intact. Eventually a patented process was developed that accomplished this in a reasonable amount of time. Since Kalvar film used no chemicals for processing, the equipment needed to use it was limited only by the speed of the transport mechanism and the power of the ultraviolet light. Used as duplication film for photoreconnaissance on carriers during the Vietnam War, processing speeds in excess of 1000 feet per minute were routinely done. A recon plane would make its run over the selected area, and on its way back to the carrier, the silver film used was developed in the aircraft. When it landed on the carrier, the silver film cassette was taken from the plane for duplication and distribution to the various specialists. The diazo-copying process is not unique to Kalvar; the basic process was already widely used in other copying processes, including the \\"whiteprint\\" paper copying system and a number of commercial microfilm copying systems. However, Kalvar was unique in using photo-excited bubbles as the \\"printing\\" medium and heat \\"fixing\\", which made it much less expensive than the other diazo systems (at least at the time). Kalvar had been in use for some time when a serious problem was discovered ‚Äì when the saran plastic broke down it gave off hydrochloric acid. The gas would not corrode the Kalvar film, but would any normal film stored nearby, and especially the storage containers.\\"Material Name: Kalvar microfilm\\", Abbey Newsletter, Volume 15, Number 8, December 1991 This was cause for serious concern, as the New York Times had invested heavily in Kalvar copying and had distributed copies of the newspaper on Kalvar microfilm to libraries around the world where they co- mingled with normal films. They had to provide free replacements of their microfilm version when the problem was noticed.\\"Comment and News\\", Microform Review, 1972, pg. 164 Versions of the Kalvar stock using improved supporting film were developed that fixed this problem.

The school was founded in 1952 and is part of the Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). Bailey's Elementary is a Title I School, and was the first magnet school in Fairfax County. Bailey's is located in the Culmore area and many children from that area attend Bailey's. In 1997, Bailey's Elementary was selected by President Bill Clinton's One America Initiative Advisory Board on Race as a model for educational excellence in diverse communities.  History  The school opened in 1952. The magnet program was established in 1991, after Bailey's parent‚Äìteacher association (PTA), under President Richard Kurin, threatened to sue the school board to redraw the school boundaries,\\"A magnet program intended to bolster Bailey's Elementary School in Fairfax County VA, almost eliminated in a round of budget cutting by the School Board, was revived after parents invoked an obscure law requiring the board to vote again.\\" hoping to bring academic, linguistic, and cultural diversity to a school with a high percentage of non-native English speakers (87% in 1991).Fairfax School Targeted For Magnet Program; Aim Is to Lure English- Speaking Students, The Washington Post, DeNeen L. Brown Oct 23, 1991 To attract students outside of the area, the school's educational program focused on the arts, science, and technology. In 1997, Bill Clinton's One America Initiative Advisory Board on Race commissioned a case study, \\"Bailey's Elementary: Educational Strategies for Making Diversity an Asset\\", calling the school \\"an educational, social and cultural haven for students from all backgrounds\\", as quoted by journalist Peter Baker. Bailey's science teacher Lynn Riggs was selected Teacher of the Year in Fairfax County in 2006. Under the 2010 FCPS budget cuts, the Magnet transportation buses that brought out- of-boundary Bailey's students to school was proposed for elimination, to save approximately $100,000. The PTA protested that this would lead to a loss of magnet families, which would in turn damage the school's diversity. In April 2009, the FCPS school board decided to maintain the magnet transportation. A second campus opened for the 2014-15 school year in a converted five-floor office building, to house Grades 3, 4, and 5 (the \\"Upper\\" school), and relieve overcrowding at the original building. The Upper School is located at 6245 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, 1.4 miles from the original building at 6111 Knollwood Drive, which continues to house grades K-2.  Educational programs  Bailey's Elementary has a partial Spanish immersion program for the math and science curriculum. The school also has a two-way immersion for kindergarten, in which both English- and Spanish-speaking students are taught half of the school day in English and the other half in Spanish. Bailey's English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program caters for around 500 students in grades K-5. In 1999, Bailey's began participating in the Kennedy Center's \\"Changing Education Through the Arts\\" (CETA) program, which integrates arts throughout the curriculum. The Kennedy Center provides professional development to the teachers that focuses on arts-integrated instruction. Under the 2010 FCPS Proposed Budget cuts, the CETA program was earmarked for elimination, but was eventually redesigned instead. The school has an educational partnership with the US Forest Service to teach students about conservation. Every year local artists help Bailey's students create murals that are displayed on the exterior and interior walls of the school.https://web.archive.org/web/20100611175355/http://www.fcps.edu/DIT/streaming/ss1_mural.asx Bailey's performing arts include 4th and 5th grade chorus, 4th and 5th grade band, 3rd grade violin, and 4th and 5th grade orchestra.

She graduated in English and philosophy from the University of Reading in 1951. She then taught at a school in the East End and worked as a copywriter and a newspaper reporter. Career The Liberty Man (1955) was Freeman's first book, written while working as a literary secretary to the novelist Louis Golding; it was about a love affair between a schoolteacher and a sailor doomed by the class system.Harrison Smith, \\"Gillian Freeman, whose novel 'Leather Boys' was a gay landmark, dies at 89\\", The Washington Post, 11 March 2019. Freeman's time with Golding was said to have inspired some of her later works. One of her best known books was the novel The Leather Boys (1961), published under the pseudonym Eliot George, after the novelist George Eliot, a story of a gay relationship between two young working-class men, one married and the other a biker, which was later turned into a film for which she wrote the screenplay, this time under her own name.

Monotrona performed in costume and in character as one of many self-styled Superbeings or Fourteen Impersonations of ManCreslins, Laris. Interview with Monotrona, Sound Collector Magazine, #1, 1997 These Superbeings took the form of marginally or partially human figures such as apes, robots, ghosts, madmen, or giants with the additional perk that they possessed (or thought they possessed) superhuman powers. All told, Monotrona evoked eight of these impersonations: Gorditz from Gorditz, Ooka, Jing Pow Ki Poo, Joey the Mechanical Boy, Hawkeye & Firebird, The Might Mun, Burglemir Frost Giant of the Supersphere, and Nakadai the Samurai. Music and Performance Monotrona shows and music are notoriously difficult to categorize but have been described as ‚Äúa perfect balance between silliness and creepiness, not to mention ‚Ä¶ the best thing to happen to the sputtering corpse of electro since asymmetrical haircuts.‚Äù Pameson, Jenna. ‚ÄúIntroducing: Burglemir the Frost Giant, Monotrona says the darndest Things‚Äù Vice Magazine, Vol 9, No 9, 2002.

One of her last incarnations, Burglemir, laments: \\"I‚Äôd like a coat and one pair of shoes / To touch the earth as only a man can do / Look at this world: it‚Äôs so damn small / My foot's a mountain and I'd like to squash it all / But I can't squash a thing because I'm not a man not a human being / Brutality‚Äôs for men, not for Superbeings.\\" Roctober Magazine wrote in its one- man band issue: \\"...as long as we can dance to the magical sounds of Monotrona, who really needs the answers?\\" One Man Band Encyclopedia.

Critics Choice. Chicago Reader, Dec 7, 2001 Monotrona's early performances (1996‚Äì1997) utilized drums and metal percussion, played while standing up, along with electronics, which Jodie built herself and played with her feet. These early performances include Gorditz, Ooka, and Jing Pow Ki Poo. Some of the homemade electronics in these performances include a sine-wave generator, square-wave generator, baby monitors, heart monitors, PZM microphones attached to drums, toy drum machines, and a Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder. As Joey the Mechanical Boy, Monotrona used a Casio keyboard and modified children's toys attached to her arms. In 1998 Monotrona moved to New York City, dispensed with actual instruments, and began using video game and other electronic samples. Beginning with Hawekeye and Firebird and continuing with The Might Mun, Monotrona used SID samples and songs from early video game music, as well as samples generated using the Elektron Sidstation. In the spring of 1999 Casey Spooner of Fischerspooner performed as Hawekeye and Firebird and even dressed in Monotrona's costume when she was unable to make her show.Lafreniere, Steve.

Early life Joseph VI Audo was born in Alqosh in 1790 and in 1814 he became a monk of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. He was ordained priest in 1818 and consecrated bishop of Mosul on the March 25, 1825, by the patriarchal administrator Augustine Hindi in Amid. From 1830 to 1847 he served as metropolitan bishop of Amadiya. In the early 19th century there was not yet a formal union between the two patriarchal lines that professed to be in communion with the Holy See. The ancient monastery of Rabban Hormizd, that for many centuries was the see of the Mama patriarchal family supported by most of the East Syrian Christians, in 1808 recognized as its own patriarch Mar Augustine Hindi, the leader of a patriarchal line started by Mar Joseph I in 1681 in union with Rome. This was fiercely opposed by the last descendant of the Mama family, Yohannan Hormizd, also in communion with Rome. Joseph Audo was a partisan of Mar Augustine Hindi and thus became an active opponent of Yohannan Hormizd: the strong conflict came to an end only through the direct intervention of two apostolic delegates sent by Rome in 1828-1829.Charles A. Frazee, Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453-1923, Cambridge University Press, 2006 After the death of Augustine Hindi the Chaldean Church was finally united under the aged Yohannan Hormizd in 1830, even if he, and his successor Nicholas I Zaya, had to deal with the internal opposition of several bishops led by Audo that lasted up to the resignation of patriarch Nicholas Zaya in 1846. Patriarch (1848‚Äì78) Joseph Audo was elected Patriarch of the Chaldean Church on July 28, 1847, and confirmed by Pope Pius IX on September 11, 1848. He is also remembered as Joseph VI, considering Mar Augustine Hindi to have the name of Joseph V. Joseph showed himself to be as energetic and combative a patriarch as he had been a bishop. During his reign he took measures to improve the calibre of the Chaldean clergy and to strengthen the episcopate and the monastic order, and mounted a successful campaign to strengthen the spread the Catholic faith into the Nestorian districts. A sincere Catholic, who had been brought to the Catholic faith after reading Joseph II's Book of the Pure Mirror, he clashed on a number of occasions with the Vatican on questions of jurisdiction. Audo laid the foundations, with help from the Vatican, for the Chaldean Church to grow and flourish remarkably in the last decades before the First World War. From his early days as bishop of Amadiya, competing with the Nestorian church for the allegiance of the villages of the Sapna valley, he had appreciated the crucial role an educated clergy could play both in consolidating the Catholic faith where it already existed and in bringing it to new hearers. Hitherto many of the Chaldean Church's bishops had been educated at the College of the Propaganda at Rome, and its priests had picked up what education they could from their bishops. Audo worked to reduce the Chaldean Church's dependence on Rome, and to ensure that it was able to train and educate its own clergy. In doing so he was following in the footsteps of Gabriel Dambo, whose revival of monasticism in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd in 1808 had been partly intended to supply the church with a well-educated and disciplined clergy. To a certain extent it did; monks from the monastery were sent out as priests and deacons to Baghdad, Basra, and a number of Chaldean villages in the Mosul and Amadiya districts in the 1820s, and no doubt served their congregations well. Audo himself and other monks later became bishops. But the first Rabban Hormizd superiors, Gabriel Dambo and Yohannan Gwera, also spent much of their energies quarreling with the patriarchs Yohannan VIII Hormizd and Nicholas I Zaya, with damaging consequences for the morale of the church. = Establishment of seminaries = These internal feuds came to an end with Audo's accession, as he had taken the side of the monastery in its struggles with his predecessors. With the co-operation of the monks assured, the new patriarch did his best to ensure that Dambo's original vision was at last realized. The Monastery of Rabban Hormizd was too remote and exposed to attack to remain a functioning monastery, and was also a symbol of a turbulent time best forgotten. Audo decided to replace it and in 1859, with financial assistance from the Vatican, built a new monastery of Notre Dame des Semences in a safer and more convenient site near Alqosh. The new monastery quickly replaced Rabban Hormizd as the principal monastery of the Chaldean church. Two other important centres for the education of Chaldean clergy were also established at Mosul during Audo's reign, the patriarchal seminary of Saint Peter in 1866 and the Syro-Chaldean seminary of Saint John, completed shortly after Audo's death in 1878. The Syro-Chaldean seminary, which trained priests for both the Chaldean and Syriac Catholic churches, was under the direction of the Dominicans, while the patriarchal seminary was directed entirely by Chaldean clergy. Although a number of Chaldean priests continued to be trained at Rome or elsewhere, most of the bishops and priests of the Chaldean church in the decades before the First World War came from one or other of these three centers founded in Audo's reign. = The Rokos affair = Despite Audo's energetic investment in the future of the Chaldean church, his relations with the Vatican were often strained. An early sign of the patriarch's independent attitude was given in 1858, when he held a synod from 7 June to 21 June in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd, whose validity was not recognized by Rome. In 1860 a far more serious clash occurred when the Malabar Catholics sent a delegation to Mosul to ask the patriarch to consecrate a bishop of their own rite for them. Despite the protests of the apostolic delegate at Mosul, Henri Amanton, Audo consecrated Thomas Rokos bishop of Basra and dispatched him to visit the Malabar Christians. Amanton thereupon censured the patriarch and his bishops, and Audo responded with two encyclicals to the priests and people of his church, the first on 21 December 1860 and the second on 4 January 1861. Shortly afterwards he departed to Rome to give an account of his actions, arriving at the end of June. He was there invited to recall Rokos, to write a letter of apology to the Propaganda and to make an act of submission to the pope. He complied with the first and third demands, and was received by the pope on 14 September. On 23 September he issued a third encyclical to his church, in which he admitted his mistakes and revoked measures he had taken against the apostolic delegation and the Dominican missionaries. He returned to Mosul on 2 December. Meanwhile, Rokos, who had been excommunicated on the Vatican‚Äôs orders by the vicar apostolic of Verapoly on his arrival in India, returned in failure to Baghdad in June 1862.Giacomo Martina Pio IX (1851-1866) (1986) , 372-4 The affair did not end there. One of the members of the reunion which had given Rokos his mission, the metropolitan of Seert Peter Bar Tatar, refused to accept the censures carried by the delegate. The patriarch was again embroiled with the Dominicans, and issued an interdict on all the places where he arrived to celebrate in the presence of the Chaldeans. There was another incident on 5 June 1864. Audo consecrated Elias Mellus bishop of Aqra, but the new bishop omitted from his profession of faith passages relating to the Council of Florence and the Council of Trent. This was reported to Rome, and although Audo spoke up for his subordinate and the affair was resolved, animosity grew on both sides. = First Vatican Council = Joseph Audo The Vatican seems to have decided thereafter to seek every opportunity to remind Audo of his position. In 1867 Gregory Peter di Natale, metropolitan of Amid, died at Rome. The Propaganda invoked the papacy's old privilege in such cases of directly appointing his successor, and asked the patriarch to submit three suitable names after discussion with his bishops. Shortly afterwards the diocese of Mardin also fell vacant with the death of Ignatius Dashto in 1868, and the Propaganda insisted on appointing his successor too. Audo duly submitted a list of seven names, and was directed to consecrate Peter Timothy Attar metropolitan of Amid and Gabriel Farso metropolitan of Mardin. He was also informed that the provisions of the ecclesiastical constitution Reversurus promulgated on 12 July 1867 for the Armenian Catholic Church would in due course be applied to all the Eastern Catholic Churches, and on 31 August 1869 its rules for the election of bishops were applied to the Chaldean Church in the bull Cum ecclesiastica disciplina. This was too much for Audo, and he refused to consecrate the bishops-designate of Amid and Mardin. He was summoned to Rome and in January 1870 forced to consecrate them. He complained that Rome was infringing the rights of the Eastern patriarchs, and was particularly aggrieved that the Syriac, Maronite and Melkite patriarchs had not yet agreed to accept the provisions of the 1867 constitution. As a result, in the 1870 First Vatican Council he was warmly welcomed as a member of the Church party opposed to the doctrine of papal infallibility, and joined in the opposition to the controversial constitution Pastor aeternus, absenting himself from the session at which it was promulgated. He then refused to adhere to it, giving the excuse that he could only take such a solemn step back home, among his own flock. He met the Sultan in Constantinople on 16 September 1870, and denounced the constitution as infringing on the traditional customs of the church and damaging the interests of the Ottoman empire. He declared that he had not accepted its provisions and never would. At the same time he celebrated Mass with the Armenian priests who had separated themselves from the patriarch Hassoun, and refused to reply to letters from the Propaganda. The Vatican, alarmed, used every means at its disposal to recall him to obedience and head off a threatened schism. Finally, on 29 July 1872, last of all the eastern patriarchs, Audo wrote a letter accepting the decisions of the Council. The Vatican decided to teach him a lesson. In Quae in patriarchatu, a stinging encyclical of 16 November 1872 addressed to the bishops, clergy and faithful of the Chaldean Church, Pope Pius IX rehearsed the many examples of Audo's intransigence, deplored his disobedience and welcomed his eventual submission. Audo's flock was left in little doubt as to who, in the Vatican's eyes, had been in the wrong. = The Mellusian schism = Audo clashed with the Vatican again in 1874. He asked pope Pius IX to restore to the Chaldean Church the traditional jurisdiction of the Church of the East over the Syrian Catholics of India. The Vatican delayed its response to this request and Audo decided not to wait. He sent Eliya Mellus, bishop of Aqra, to India as a metropolitan, where he was promptly excommunicated by the Vatican. On 24 May 1874, without prior consultation with the Vatican, he consecrated Eliya Peter Abulyonan metropolitan of Gazarta and Mattai Paul Shamina metropolitan of Amadiya. On 1 May 1875 he consecrated Quriaqos Giwargis Goga metropolitan of Zakho and Philip Yaqob Abraham metropolitan for India, to assist Elƒ±ya Mellus. The pope threatened in an encyclical letter of 1 September 1876 to excommunicate both the patriarch and the bishops whom he had consecrated unless they returned to obedience within 40 days. Audo yielded in March 1877 and wrote to recall Eliya Mellus and Philip Abraham from India. He was absolved from censure and commended for his compliance in the papal letters Solatio nobis fuit (9 June 1877) and Iucundum nobis (11 July 1877), and his episcopal appointments outside India were recognized.Michael Angold Eastern Christianity, Cambridge University Press, 2006 pag 528-529 However, after being deprived of the long-desired bishop Audo had provided them, some of the Syrian Catholics in India broke away in the Mellusian schism to form the Nestorian Chaldean Syrian Church.The Cambridge History of Christianity, Cambridge University Press: 2006 , pag 422 = Final years = Joseph Audo died reconciled with the Vatican, in Mosul on March 14, 1878.David Wilmshurst, The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913, Peeters Publishers, 2000 His obituary was pronounced in a consistory held on 28 February 1879 by Pope Leo XIII, who praised him as \\"a man adorned with a fine sense of faith and belief\\" (quem eximius pietatis et religionis sensus ornabat). Although there are no lack of sources for his eventful career, he has not yet had a biographer. Audo was succeeded as patriarch of Babylon by Eliya Peter Abulyonan, metropolitan of Gazarta, who was elected in 1878 in the monastery of Notre Dame des Semences and confirmed on 28 February 1879 under the title Eliya XII.

He gained his nickname, \\"Madruga\\" because he was an \\"early riser\\" (). He was a major political player in the Kingdom of Galicia, as well as spending time in the courts of Castile and Portugal. He was one of the leading figures who suppressed the Irmandi√±o peasant revolt in Galicia in the 1460s, and he was also involved in the War of the Castilian Succession after the death of Henry IV in 1474. Family Pedro was the illegitimate son of Fern√°n Eanes de Soutomaior; his mother has never been identified for certain. When Fern√°n died, his estates passed to his legitimate son, Alvaro. However, Alvaro died whilst still unmarried, and although the next legal heir was Alvaro's aunt, provision was made with her agreement to allow Pedro to inherit the estates instead. He was subsequently legitimized by the sovereigns of Castile and Portugal, and became Don Pedro Alvarez de Sotomayor. He married Teresa de T√°vora, who came from a noble Portuguese family. His children included Crist√≥bal de Sotomayor, who would sail with Diego Columbus (eldest son of Christopher Columbus) to the West Indies. Crist√≥bal would become governor of Puerto Rico. Pedro's ancestral home was Soutomaior Castle, although he also resided for periods of his life in the courts of Castile and Portugal. Nickname Pedro √Ålvarez de Sotomayor acquired the epithet \\"Madruga\\" because he would \\"rise early\\" () in the morning. According to legend he first gained the nickname as a result of a dispute with the Count of Ribadavia concerning the boundaries of their respective lands. To settle the dispute the two men agreed to rise at the first cockcrow, mount their horses, and ride toward each other's castle. Their meeting point would mark the new boundary. Instead of waiting until dawn Pedro Alvarez decided that first cockcrow was at midnight, and so rode through the night until he reached his rival's castle. When the Count emerged on hearing the dawn cockcrow, he found Don Pedro standing at his door, and exclaimed \\"Pedro Madruga!\\" Career Pedro Madruga was a figure in the court of Henry IV of Castile, and the king entrusted him with the role of keeping the powerful Bishop of Santiago, Alonso de Fonseca, under control. In the 1460s the second Irmandi√±o revolt erupted in Galicia when the peasantry rebelled against the regional nobility. Pedro Madruga had already sought refuge in Portugal. At the request of the nobles, he raised an army and confronted the irmandi√±os on several occasions until he finally managed to subdue them. During the War of the Castilian Succession in the 1470s he was a supporter of Joanna la Beltraneja (daughter of Henry IV) against the claims of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand. Reputation Pedro Madruga's reputation is that of \\"a turbulent magnate who plowed a deep furrow in Galicia's troubled fifteenth century\\". Nevertheless, he was a popular figure in Galicia and was commemorated with the following lines: Christopher Columbus? In the late 19th century the Spanish writer Garc√≠a de la Riega:es:Celso Garc√≠a de la Riega proposed the theory that Christopher Columbus had a Galician origin. Although briefly popular, the theory had fallen out of favour by the late 20th century. However, in recent years it has been proposed that Pedro Madruga and Christopher Columbus were the same person. According to this theory, Madruga did not die in 1486 but changed his identity to disguise a pact between his former enemies, the Catholic Monarchs, and himself. This thesis is based on several lines of evidence: such as Columbus named coastal features of the West Indies with the names of more than 100 localities of the Pontevedra estuary (near Soutomaior in Galicia); and the similarity of the handwriting of Columbus and Pedro Madruga. One argument against is a will drafted in 1491 by Alvaro de Sotomayor, eldest son of Pedro Madruga. In this document, Alvaro stipulates that \\"the bones of my parents ... be brought to be interred in the chapel of S. Obispo D. Juan in the Cathedral Church of Tuy,\\" although this document implies that Pedro Madruga was dead in 1491 rather than 1486.

More research has shown that they are typical free- living amoebae, and can be found worldwide in soil, plant litter, and standing decaying plants, as well as freshwater ponds. In 2001, the first and only case of human pathogenesis in Sappinia was confirmed.Gelman, B. B. 2001: Amoebic Encephalitis Due to Sappinia diploidea. Jama, 285(19), 2450. doi:10.1001/jama.285.19.2450 The patient was a non-immunocompromised 38-year- old male who presented signs of amoebic encephalitis and who patient made a full recovery after treatment with several antimicrobials. The CDC initially classified the causative agent as S. diploidea based on morphological characteristics, but in 2009, Qvarnstrom et al. used molecular data to confirm that the true causative agent was S. pedata.  Etymology  The name Sappinia was named after Mister Sappin-Trouffy, who was a mycologist at the Paris Academy of Sciences, where the genus was first discovered.  History of knowledge  The genus Sappinia was discovered in 1896 by Pierre Augustin Dangeard at the Paris Academy of Sciences. Dangeard noticed white patches on a desiccated culture of horse dung, and when viewed under the microscope, he observed many amoebae. These amoebae were generally binucleated and resembled the myxamoeba life cycle stage present in some plasmodial slime molds; however, Dangeard never observed the plasmodia stage. This was the first species of Sappinia discovered, Sappinia pedata. The second species discovered, Sappinia diploidea was originally named Amoeba diploidea, and was first found in 1908 by Max Hartmann and Kurt N√§gler. It was isolated from the intestinal material of a lizard; however, it was not thought to be parasitic, as it was not found in 20 other lizards sampled, and a very similar strain was isolated from soil. It was named ‚Äúdiploidea‚Äù because the organism was only ever seen in the diploid stage. N√§gler stated that there is no true haploid stage; however, further studies have not been able to come to this conclusion, as the nuclei become difficult to discern during sexual reproduction. In 1912 A. diploidea was transferred to the genus Sappinia by Alexis Alexeieff. He classified the genus Sappinia on the basis of being mostly binucleate, with promitotic cell division without the presence of an equatorial plate. Up until very recently these were the only known species of Sappinia, but a new study published in 2015 indicates the discovery of a third species, Sappinia platani, isolated from the bark of a sycamore tree. Sequencing of its small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) confirmed that it is a member of the genus Sappinia, but genetically distinct from S. pedata and S. diploidea. Morphologically, S. platani appears very similar to a typical member of Sappinia, but contains dictyosomes, which had not been reported in this genus previously.  Habitat and ecology  Initially, members of Sappinia were thought to be only coprozoic, as they were first found in animal feces; however, they have now been found in many other habitats, and are considered typical free living amoebae. Sappinia species are found worldwide in soil, plant litter, and standing decaying plants, freshwater ponds, and have also been found in the feces of horses, lizards, bison, elk, buffalo, and dogs. They are heterotrophic, and feed mostly on bacteria and smaller amoebae.Corsaro, D., Wylezich, C., Walochnik, J., Venditti, D., & Michel, R. 2016: Molecular identification of bacterial endosymbionts of Sappinia strains. Parasitology Research, 116(2), 549-558. doi:10.1007/s00436-016-5319-4 Sappinia species, like many other free-living amoebae, play an important role in nutrient cycling in soil. Sappinia species and their sister genus Thecamoeba are susceptible to infection by rozellids, that act as endonuclear parasites.Corsaro, D., Walochnik, J., Venditti, D., Steinmann, J., M√ºller, K., & Michel, R. 2014: Microsporidia-like parasites of amoebae belong to the early fungal lineage Rozellomycota. Parasitology Research, 113(5), 1909-1918. doi:10.1007/s00436-014-3838-4 Sappinia species are not generally susceptible to bacterial infection; but, they have been shown to harbor bacterial endosymbionts. In a recent study, Corsaro et al. (2016), found that all of the Sappinia strains tested harbored distinct species of Flavobacterium and/or Pedobacter, which are not known to be commensals of any other free-living amoebae. When these bacterial endosymbionts were isolated, they were unable to grow them in culture, thus they hypothesize that these bacterial species are obligate endosymbionts specific to the genus Sappinia. Although Sappinia species are generally considered to be non-parasitic, there has been one confirmed case of amoebic encephalitis in a non-immunocompromised 38-year-old male caused by S. pedata.Qvarnstrom, Y., Silva, A. D., Schuster, F., Gelman, B., & Visvesvara, G. 2009: Molecular confirmation of Sappinia pedata as a causative agent of amoebic encephalitis.

The posterior end of the cell is usually jagged; however, there is no distinct uroid (ruffled membrane caused by the movement of cytoplasm out of that region) in motile cells. Sappinia tend to form distinct clusters in culture, possibly due to congregation where the bacterial count is highest. The sister genus Thecamoeba does not produce a true theca (shell), but are so named because they contain a very thick, dense glycocalyx, which can be up to 0.5 mm thick. Unlike Thecamoeba, Sappina species have highly varied glycocalyces depending on the strain and life cycle stage, and none are as thick or well defined as in Thecamoeba. Another difference between Thecamoeba and Sappinia is the surface of the dorsal region; Thecamoeba species tend to have well defined longitudinal ridges on the dorsal surface, whereas Sappinia species have a smooth dorsal surface, with some small wrinkles along the edges of the cell. Sappinia species also contain tubular mitochondrial cristae, and have a large contractile vacuole that changes in shape during locomotion. S. pedata has erect, cyst-like, standing amoebae, while S. platani has dictyosomes . The erect standing amoebae were originally observed by Dangeard (1896) in S. pedata, and were originally called spores or pedicellate cysts, as they looked similar to the spore-bearing stalks seen in slime molds. Further studies have concluded that there is no cell wall present in these standing amoebae, and they continue to change shape while in the erect position, therefore they are not cysts or spores. Sappinia species are generally binucleate, with two large, closely apposed nuclei with a flattened, desmosome-like connection. This is a defining feature of Sappinia, as their sister genus Thecamoebae are mononucleate, and in other binucleate amoebae such as Pelomyxa binucleata, the nuclei are not closely apposed. Each nucleus is between 3.8-4.6 mm in diameter, each with its own central nucleolus that is around 2.3 mm in diameter. = Life cycles = Sappinia species have two life cycle stages: a trophozoite, and a cyst. The trophozoite is the heterotrophic feeding stage described previously, and the cyst is formed from the fusion of two trophozoites. The cysts are usually round, and between 30‚Äì34 mm in diameter. In 1908, N√§gler was working on S. diploidea and after 2‚Äì3 weeks in culture he observed 2 equal size trophozoites encyst together in a double wall. N√§gler stated that first the pairs of nuclei in each trophozoite fuse, and then the cells fuse together in the cyst. The amoeba that arises from the cyst is thought to have two haploid nuclei, making it a diploid, thus there is no true haploid life cycle stage. Many other studies have found these bicellular, double walled cysts in both S. diploidea and S. pedata; however, the fusion of nuclei has never been documented, as they become very difficult to detect during this process, therefore the exact process of sexual reproduction (including the presence of a haploid stage) are not currently known. The encystation process is likely to be used for sexual reproduction. N√§gler had also stated that when exposed to dry conditions for long periods of time, the trophozoites did not encyst, further supporting the hypothesis that the cysts are used for sexual reproduction, and not as protection from desiccation. Sappinia species also undergo asexual reproduction, as described by N√§gler in 1908. First the two nuclei divide, and two pairs of nuclei are formed in parallel configuration. Then the nuclei cross and become anti- parallel, so that each daughter cell receives half of each of the two nuclei. Cell division then occurs, and binucleate trophozoites are formed. Although the majority of cells are binucleate, many studies have observed cells with one or four nuclei, and some studies have also observed cells with three, six, and eight nuclei. According to Walochnik et al. (2010), N√§gler observed that the rare, mononucleate cells ‚Äúmostly derived from copulation when one of the copulating amoebae degraded so that the final amoeba was a product of parthenogenesis, the nuclei of one and the same individual fusing, or, but very rarely, derived from cells in which the reduced gametic nuclei of the copulating amoebae fused‚Äù. Uninucleate amoebae are found more often in older cultures, with fragmented nucleoli, and usually later degrade. The presence of more than two nuclei is due to nuclear division, without cell division occurring immediately after. In the case of very rare trinucleate cells found by Brown et al. (2007), it is due to incomplete nuclear division. When tetranucleate cells are found, the two pairs are not appressed to each other. = Genetics and phylogeny = Molecular analyses have been used to determine the phylogenetic position and evolutionary relationships of Sappinia. Sequencing of SSU rRNA has shown the distinct separation of the three species S.pedata, S. diploidea, and S. platani, and has confirmed that Sappinia forms a monophyletic group with their sister genus Thecamoeba within the family Thecamoebidae. Brown et al. (2007), also looked at the actin gene sequences of Sappinia and Thecamoeba and found that they only differed by two amino acids, which also supports that they are sister groups. The genus Stenamoeba has recently been shown to be an early branching member of Thecamoebidae, thus Thecamoebidae currently consists of three genera.Smirnov, A. V., Nassonova, E. S., Chao, E., & Cavalier-Smith, T. 2007: Phylogeny, Evolution, and Taxonomy of Vannellid Amoebae. Protist, 158(3), 295-324. doi:10.1016/j.protis.2007.04.004 73 Dermamoeba algensis was previously placed within the family Thecamoebidae based on morphological characteristics, but molecular studies have shown that based on molecular data they do not belong within Thecamoebidae, and their phylogenetic position is currently being debated.  Medical importance  Amoebic encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by various different amoebae, for example Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba species, Balamuthia mandrillaris, or Entamoeba histolytica. These infections are rare, and usually lethal.Gelman, B. B., Popov, V., Chaljub, G., Nader, R., Rauf, S. J., Nauta, H. W., & Visvesvara, G. S. 2003: Neuropathological and Ultrastructural Features of Amebic Encephalitis Caused by Sappinia diploidea. Journal of Neuropathology & Experimental Neurology, 62(10), 990-998. doi:10.1093/jnen/62.10.990 Naegleria fowleri causes primary amoebic encephalitis (PAE), which progresses very rapidly, whereas Acanthamoeba species cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), which is also usually lethal, but develops slower than PAE. Acanthamoeba species and Balamuthia mandrillaris usually only cause disease in immunocompromised patients and Entamoeba histolytica can cause encephalitis after infecting another region in the body. There has been only one documented case of pathogenesis involving Sappinia species, which resulted in granulomatous amoebic encephalitis in a non-immunocompromised 38-year-old male from Texas in 1998. The fact that the patient was non-immunocompromised is surprising because there is only one known amoeba (Naegleria fowleri) that causes disease in healthy individuals. The patient lived on a farm and was in close contact with grazing farm animals, which is likely where he contracted the infection. The Sappinia species was likely in the soil, and was consumed by a grazing animal along with plant matter, and was then expelled in the feces. The patient is thought to have inhaled the Sappinia species while cleaning up the animal dung. As described by Gelman et al. (2003), the patient ‚Äúpresented with a history of loss of consciousness for 45 min and emesis, followed by bifrontal headache, photophobia, and blurry vision for 2 to 3 days‚Äù (p. 990). His medical history only consisted of a recent sinus infection, which was probably due to Sappinia, which then spread to the brain. An MRI revealed a 2 cm mass in the left temporal lobe, and when excised, showed necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation containing trophozoite amoebae. The trophozoites were between 40‚Äì60 mm in diameter, and had two closely apposed nuclei with a distinct central flattening. The trophozoites also contained tubular mitochondrial cristae, and a large contractile vacuole. All of these characteristics are distinguishing features of the genus Sappinia. The medical team sent the sample to the CDC, who confirmed that these characteristics do not coincide with any previously known pathogenic amoebae in humans. The patient was treated with several antimicrobials and recovered completely. After 14 months, the CDC diagnosed the causative agent as S. diploidea based on morphological characteristics. In 2009, Qvarnstrom et al. reevaluated this conclusion, as the morphological characteristics present in the scans cannot distinguish between S. diploidea and S. pedata. Qvarnstrom et al. (2009) first used PCR primers and TaqMan probes to detect if the trophozoites did in fact belong to Sappinia, and to rule out other amoeba genera. They found that the DNA was that of Sappinia, and no other amoebae DNA was found. They then had to use species-specific PCR primers for S. diploidea and S. pedata to determine the causative agent. Qvarnstrom et al. (2009) found that the sample tested negative for S. diploidea but had S. pedata-specific priming sites, which then allowed them to conlucde that the causative agent of GAE in this case was S. pedata.

Similar in style to the later town car, the brougham style was used on chauffeur-driven petrol and electric cars. In later years, several manufacturers (mostly in the United States) have used the term brougham as a model name or trim level on cars where the driver is in the cabin with the passengers (i.e. cars that do not use the brougham body style). Early broughams 1899 Peugeot Type 27 brougham As a car body style, a brougham was initially a vehicle similar to a limousine but with an outside seat in front for the chauffeur and an enclosed cabin behind for the passengers. As such, it was a version of the town car but, in strict use of the term, with the sharply squared rear end of the roof and the forward-curving body line at the base of the front of the passenger enclosure that were characteristic of the nineteenth century brougham carriage on which the car style was based.

At that time, there were more than 200 manufacturers of these cars in the United States. In the United States during the first two decades of the twentieth century, the front of the body and the chauffeur were often deleted from the design, with controls placed inside for the owner to operate the vehicle.

The hospital operates two osteopathic residency programs, in internal medicine and family medicine. The hospital is operated by Skagit Regional Health, which is partnered with the Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington. History Skagit Valley Hospital was founded in 1958. The operations of the hospital are overseen by a seven-member Board of Commissioners, elected by the district's constituents. In June 2007, the hospital opened a 220,000 square foot expansion, at a cost of $95 million. The expansion included 92 patient rooms, 6 operating rooms, a birthing center, and an emergency department. On July 1, 2010, Skagit Valley Hospital acquired Skagit Valley Medical Center, a multi-specialty medical group, with facilities in six locations in the Skagit Valley. As of the acquisition the former Medical Center facilities was renamed Skagit Regional Clinics. The combined organization is now known as Skagit Regional Health, which also acquired Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington in 2016. In 2011, the hospital began training medical students. In 2012, the hospital opened an internal medicine residency. In 2019, the hospital announced plans to gradually phase out the family medicine residency program, after meeting challenges posed by the single accreditation system, which formed after the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accreditation pathways merged. Services The hospital includes 173 beds, and operates a level 3 trauma center through its emergency department and a Cardiac Catheterization Unit. The hospital provides oncology services, including PET scanning. Graduate medical education Skagit Valley Hospital operates two residency programs, which train newly graduated physicians. There is an osteopathic internal medicine residency program, and a family medicine program. Both programs are accredited by the ACGME and maintain osteopathic recognition from the AOA.

The Authority's mission (as authorized in Chapter 331, Part Two, Florida Statutes) was to retain, expand and diversify the state's space-related industry. Chapter 331 gives FSA governmental powers similar to other types of transportation authorities (airport, seaport, etc.) to support and regulate the state's space transportation industry. It was empowered to own, operate, construct, finance, acquire, extend, equip and improve spaceport infrastructure.

ISS Research Competition In 2012, Space Florida partnered with NanoRacks to host the Space Florida International Space Station (ISS) Research Competition. Participants competed to fly scientific research payloads in NanoLabs to the International Space Station. The experiments were then conducted on board the U.S. National Lab. Space Florida covered the costs of research payload transportation to the ISS for the eight winning applicants. The Space Florida ISS Research Competition is designed to inspire innovation and enable unique research opportunities and access for customers to the ISS. Earlier proposed spaceport In the early 2010s, Space Florida proposed a commercial spaceport at Shiloh, in northern Brevard County, but those plans never came to fruition. Located immediately north of the U.S. Government's Kennedy Space Center, the open access to the U.S. Air Force's Eastern Range over the open Atlantic Ocean to the east, and easy access to the range's tracking facilities made the location attractive on many margins. Among other potential users of the spaceport facility, SpaceX was reported to be considering Shiloh as one of several potential locations for building a commercial launch facility. Opponents of the proposed Shiloh launch location cite the potential for a negative impact on the natural environment because this area is home to several species listed as endangered or threatened. Even though the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has yet to agree to turn over the land to the State of Florida for commercial development, NASA has agreed to let the Federal Aviation Administration lead an environmental impact study at the proposed site. SpaceX ended up selecting Brownsville, Texas to build its private spaceport. On May 2, 2013, the Volusia County Council voted 6-1 in favor of a commercial launch site at Shiloh. Though largely symbolic in nature, the vote was considered by many to be a critical step toward any future development of the proposed Shiloh location. In July 2014, after difficulties gaining support from environmental groups and others, Space Florida began looking for alternatives to the Shiloh location that would facilitate commercial space launch pads on the Florida Space Coast. These include working with the U.S. Air Force to see about converting some of the very large amount of unused military launch pads at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (south of Shiloh) to state land that might be used as a commercial spaceport. The efforts in late 2014 to find an alternative ultimately came to fruition in 2015 to open a Space Florida spaceport at a different location, with the September 2015 announcement that Blue Origin would manufacture their new orbital launch vehicle at Exploration Park, and launch the rocket from Launch Complex 36.

It is an early-20th-century Georgian Revival‚Äìstyle mansion created from a stone farmhouse built about 1825, overlooking the Patapsco River valley. The reconstruction was designed by Baltimore architect Edward L. Palmer, Jr. in 1917. The main house is five bays in length, two and a half stories above a high ground floor, with a gambrel roof. The house has a -story wing, five bays in length, with a gabled roof, extending from the east end; and a two-story, one-bay west wing. The roof is covered with Vermont slate. The house features a small enclosed porch of the Tuscan order that was probably originally considered a porte cochere. Hilton is situated on the 5000 acre \\"Taylor's Forest\\" surveyed in 1678. The first construction at the 511 acre site was a stone farmhouse built between 1818-1825 for James W. McCulloh. After defending several charges of conspiracy, the property was sold to John Lewis Buchanan in 1825. In 1827 Dr. Lennox Birckhead, son of McColloh's business partner Soloman Birkhead purchased the property. Birkhead named his home \\"Hilton\\" for its high elevation. William Carson Glenn purchased the property in 1837 selling to his politician brother John Glenn in 1842. Guests during this period included Robert E. Lee. In 1852, Glenn added several stone outbuildings. The property passed to Marrietta Glen and was managed by newspaper publisher William Wilkens Glenn. William Glenn managed the farm with 26 slaves, sympathizing with the south during the civil war. Hilton was used as a stopping location for Southerners fleeing Union troops for home. Glenn died in 1876 with the farm falling into disuse. In 1905 the estate was subdivided into 25 lots. In 1907 43 acres were donated by Russell Sage Foundation director John Mark Glenn(1858-1950) to create the first section of Patapsco Valley State Park. Hilton was purchased in 1917 by National Enameling and Stamping Company owner George Worth Knapp as a summer home and dairy farm reassembling 105 acres of the estate. In 1962 Baltimore County Public Schools purchased the property to establish a Community College of Baltimore County branch. In the 1970s Lecture halls occupied the mansion. In 2011, a grant was awarded to renovate the building as the Center for Global Education. In addition to the Hilton Mansion, several other slavery-era outbuildings are on the property: two Tudor style stone houses built in 1852, of which one is in ruins; an 1852 stone bowling alley in ruins; and a stone gardeners building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In 1920 he won a bronze medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his painting Joueur de Football (Football Player). During the Second World War he found it difficult to align himself with the rationing system for food and other goods. He often lost his war-coupons for food and life necessities. He found shelter, food, and help exchanging his coupons with the Jesuit priests managing the Xaverius College in Borgerhout, Antwerp. In exchange for the help, he offered a piece of work of a religious nature. The Jesuits liked the work and ordered another, this time above the entrance of one of the doors leading to a chapel. As there were many positive reactions and a lot of fascination with the style, power, and dynamism of his art, he was offered to make drawings on all the walls all over the college. The artwork depicts the life of Franciscus Xaverius, the patron saint of Xaverius College and Jesuit of the Jesuit order managing the college. Because of the war, there was no paint available, so his wall drawings was made with charcoal and woodcoal sticks. Much later on a protective layer was added and today the paintings still stand as one of the prides of the college.

The block aired on Saturdays and Sundays, usually starting at 9:25am (the first ever edition began at 9:55am). It began on Saturday 17 January 2009 with a three-hour edition. The majority of editions were one to two hours in length. The first series was originally scheduled to run for twelve weeks (to Sunday 12 April 2009), but STV subsequently decided to extend the run, which eventually ended on 21 June, just before the Scottish school summer holidays. A second series of wknd@stv began on Saturday 15 August 2009; this ran for six weeks, ending on 20 September 2009. Featured programming consisted of cartoons, live-action drama/comedy and gameshows, principally archive output produced or co-produced by Scottish/Grampian (formerly SMG Productions or Scottish Television Enterprises); there was also some imported programming to which STV holds the rights, such as Flying Rhino Junior High, which STV co-produced prior to the launch of wknd@stv. At the time of wknd@stv launching, the ITV network was not airing children's programming on weekend mornings. A networked CITV block was reintroduced in March and April 2009 and again from September 2009; STV prioritised their own show, such that in weeks where both wknd@stv and the CITV block were running, STV would screen their strand first and timeshift the CITV block to run afterwards; if there was not room to do this then the CITV block would be omitted completely in favour of the local show. In several weeks where the structure of the ITV network schedule did not permit STV to opt out and/or timeshift networked content on Sundays, only a Saturday edition would run. The links were produced in the 16:9 widescreen format. Some of the insert programming was only available in the older 4:3 format; this is cropped to be screened in the compromise 14:9 format with coloured bars at the sides of the screen to make up the difference. Shows made in 16:9 are not cropped. The method by which the programme links were produced and broadcast ‚Äì a string of programmes interlaced with 'recorded-as-live' links, clips, skits and short features ‚Äì is similar to that employed by Channel 4's T4 strand. In 2015, STV city channels STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh began a new children's strand, \\"Weans' World\\", which re-broadcast most of the programmes shown as part of wknd@stv.

Presenters The programme was presented by two Scottish teenagers, Kimberley Neill ('Kim') and Jonathon Pender ('Johnny').Glasgow Acting AcademyEvening Times Until 5 April 2009, Kim and Johnny would present on Saturdays only, with another young duo, Caitlin Murphy and Nathan Byrne, presenting on Sundays. However, from the following week Murphy and Byrne were dropped, and Kim and Johnny presented all subsequent editions.

The book explores the events surrounding the slave mutiny on the Spanish schooner La Amistad in 1839. The ship was taken into United States custody off the south coast of Long Island, New York. The book discusses the roles and international dynamics of the case, involving Spain, England, and the United States as they related to the 19th-century slave trade. It examines United States v. The Amistad Africans 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 518 (1841), the United States Supreme Court case that adjudicated the property issues and ultimately the fate of the Mende people who were held captive on Amistad and the ownership of the vessel. Reception The book is by Howard Jones, a historian at the University of Alabama, and published in New York by Oxford University Press. In his review published in Civil War History, Dudley T. Cornish noted that in 1965, the historian Samuel Eliot Morison described the Amistad case of 1839 as \\"the most famous involving slavery,\\" until it was \\"eclipsed by the Dred Scott decision.\\"Dudley T. Cornish, Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy (review), Civil War History, Volume 34, Number 1, March 1988, pp. 79-80, Project Muse 10.1353/cwh.1988.0011, accessed 30 March 2013 Cornish wrote that Jones' work was \\"a careful, comprehensive study\\" that should make it easy to restore references to the case in textbooks, where it had been overlooked in the prior decade.  Legacy  The 1997 film Amistad, directed by Steven Spielberg, is based on this book, including the Supreme Court case. It stars Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, Morgan Freeman as an American abolitionist, Djimon Hounsou as Cinqu√©, leader of the slaves; and Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin, the lawyer to the Mende captives.

Founded by guitarist Lee and drummer Paul and original guitarist Scott when they decided to get serious after disbanding a covers band. Band history Prior to Dragnerve Paul and Lee have made music together since 1996 whether in bands or music projects such as 'Fluid and the Weird Guys', 'Futureproof', a drum and bass band; but it was their love for heavy metal that pushed them into forming the covers band that led them to form 'Dragnerve. Paul has also trained as a studio engineer which is put into practice on Dragnerve tracks. Andy Hutton joined the band in November 2007 after a long search and mediocre auditions. He has been singing in various bands in and around the South East of England for over a decade. From playing the London club circuit in Undertow and Dash-K, he hooked up with now defunct Southend noise merchants Stoopi in 2000, and recorded their debut album, Unspoken Word, in 2001 to a fair amount of critical acclaim for an underground UK band. However, the band eventually split due to label issues. In February 2009, Rolly Lyons became a full-time member of Dragnerve. Rolly was from the band Flict. Founding member Lee Tibbetts has been in bands all his adult life and is the main songwriter. He currently divides his time between Dragnerve and being an effects artist on major motion pictures. Film soundtracks Dragnerve contributed a track to the motion picture The Age of Stupid starring Pete Postlethwaite. \\"The film was \\"crowd-funded\\", with the ¬£450k budget being raised by selling ‚Äúshares‚Äù to 223 individuals and groups. These groups range from a hockey team and a women's health centre. This is mostly to give it the best chance of reaching a mainstream multiplex audience, but also to retain complete editorial control. These investors all own a percentage of the film - as do the crew, who are working for heavily reduced rates\\". The film had a major release on the 20 March 2009 in 35 cinemas across the UK. The soundtrack wase released in conjunction with the release of the film. The soundtrack includes songs from Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Dragnerve and The Band of Holy Joy, as well as an original orchestral score written by Chris Brierley. Dragnerve in The Age of Stupid Games soundtracks Dragnerve contributed a new recording of the track \\"A Life in Ashes\\" to the game All Points Bulletin an upcoming massively multiplayer online video game for Microsoft Windows based in urban sprawls and featuring two sides, Enforcers and the Criminals. Players may join either the Enforcers or the Criminals, and form sub-groups in these. The game design is led by David Jones, creator of the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown, and is being developed by Realtime Worlds. It is due to be released on 29 June 2010 in North America, followed by a 1 July release in Europe and 2 July in the United Kingdom. Reviews \\"Dragnerve, they're not about blasting you with blast beats and kind of froggy vocals you know, they've got a bit of melody and have an old school kind of groove to them as well. Think Pantera mixed with Machine Head with a bit of Metallica as well!\\" - Johnny Doom - Kerrang Radio \\"Formed in London as recently as December 2007, Dragnerve are out to fly their flag against the forces of metal-gone-pop they see much of the present day metal scene to be devolving into. So when we say they play a metal rooted in the sounds of Metallica and Pantera, it'd be easy to think 'here's another nostalgia act'. Thankfully, what we have here is a band who use their influences as just that. Which is why the likes of 'A Life In Ashes', could have existed a decade ago, but still sounds remarkable fresh today. Vocalist Andy Hutton's vocals are used mostly in a soulful Scott Weiland croon to a thuggish, Anselmo growl to a full on monsters scream. For a demo, and for a band less than a year old, this is impressive work.\\" - Phill May - Rock Midgets.com \\"London based metallers Dragnerve have only been together since the ass-end of 2007 and already they've released this, their debut demo...I do detect a hint of something special here. First up, the music is as vibrant as hell, with the guitars in particular, sounding extremely fresh, with hints of old school Metallica, early Machine Head and the obligatory Pantera influence...The Thrashy undertones have huge potential and Dragnerve sound genuinely exciting when the intensity kicks in\\". -Live4Metal \\"This is a band who are surely destined to be a British institution, 'cos they give it plenty & there's plenty of it!!

It was broadcast in the US as part of Masterpiece Theatre during Season 21 that ran from 1991‚Äì1992. Plot summary The miniseries is about a young RAF Fighter Pilot Flying Officer Hugh Fleming DFC, played by Nigel Havers, who is shot down during the Battle of Britain and is severely burned around the face and hands. While recovering and experiencing life as a scarred casualty of war, his colleagues and friends who had joined the RAF with him die one by one. This series shows how burn victims are treated and how they have to recuperate. It is hard for Fleming because he was an extremely handsome young man who had no problem dating women. With his face deformed by the burns and the plastic surgery, his life becomes a rather more traumatic one.

He is one of the co-inventors of the world's first microprocessor architecture, the Intel 4004, together with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima, and Federico Faggin. Early years Mazor was born to Jewish parents, As a youth, Mazor's family moved to California, where he attended Oakland High School from which he graduated in 1959. He enrolled in San Francisco State University (SFSU), majoring in math and studying helicopter design and construction as a hobby. Mazor met his future wife Maurine at SFSU and they wed in 1962. Around the same time, he became interested in computers and learned to program SFSU's IBM 1620 computer, taking a position as a professor's assistant and teaching other students to use the technology. Meanwhile, he continued to study computer architecture in technical manuals outside of school. Career summary In 1964, he became a programmer with Fairchild Semiconductor, followed by a position as computer designer in the Digital Research Department, where he co-patented \\"Symbol\\", a high-level language computer. In 1969, he joined the year-old Intel Corporation, and was soon assigned to work with Ted Hoff on a project to help define the architecture of a microprocessor‚Äîoften dubbed a \\"computer-on-a- chip\\"‚Äîbased on a concept developed earlier by Hoff. The Japanese calculator manufacturer Busicom asked Intel to complete the design and manufacture of a new set of chips. Credited along with Faggin, Hoff, and Masatoshi Shima of Busicom as co-inventor, Mazor helped define the architecture and the instruction set for the revolutionary new chip, dubbed the Intel 4004. Although there was an initial reluctance on the part of Intel marketing to undertake the support and sale of these products to general customers, Hoff and Mazor joined Faggin, designer of the 4004 and project leader, and actively campaigned for their announcement to the industry and helped define a support strategy that the company could accept. Intel finally announced the 4004 in 1971. After working as a computer designer for six years, Mazor moved to Brussels, Belgium where he continued to work for Intel, now as an application engineer helping customers to use the company's products. He returned to California the following year, and began teaching, first in Intel's Technical Training group, and later at Stanford University and the University of Santa Clara. Various teaching engagements took him around the world, including Stellenbosch, South Africa; Stockholm, Sweden; and Nanjing, China. In 1984, Mazor joined Silicon Compiler Systems. In 2008, Mazor was the Training Director of BEA Systems. Publications In 1993, then working at Synopsys, he coauthored, with Patricia Langstraat, a book on chip design language entitled A Guide to VHDL. Over the course of his career, Mazor has also published fifty articles. Recognition Shima and Mazor at the Computer History Museum's 2009 Fellows Award event Along with his co-inventors Hoff, Faggin, and Shima, he has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the Ron Brown American Innovator Award, the 1997 Kyoto Prize, and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2009 the four were inducted as Fellows of the Computer History Museum \\"for their work as the team that developed the Intel 4004, the world's first commercial microprocessor.\\" In 2010, Mazor and his co-inventors Hoff and Faggin, were awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Barack Obama.

The 33-year-old Kiffin was an assistant coach at USC with Coach Norm Chow for number of years. Kai Forbath kicked four field goals to help the Bruins bring home a 19‚Äì15 victory at Tennessee. Rahim Moore again played an outstanding game with two interceptions. Chane Moline caught a 12-yard pass from Kevin Prince for the only UCLA touchdown. The Bruin defense kept the Tennessee team from the end zone for much of the game, allowing the Vols 208 total yards. Prince completed 11 of 23 passes for 101 yards. Scoring for the Vols was Montario Hardesty (11-yard run), Daniel Lincoln (31, 28-yard field goals) and Dennis Rogan (safety), which was aided by two UCLA third-and-long penalties and a UCLA fumble. During the final minutes of the game, Prince had his right jaw broken. He was projected to be out for three to four weeks. =Kansas State= This was the first meeting between the two teams. Kansas State had a 1‚Äì1 record going into the game, having lost to the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns 17‚Äì15 the previous week. Bill Snyder came out of retirement to coach the Wildcats. Former wide receiver Mike Sherrard, who played for 10 years with the NFL, was the honorary game captain. Kevin Craft, last year's starter, took over at quarterback in relief of Kevin Prince, who fractured his jaw the previous week against Tennessee. Craft passed for 186 yards and a touchdown to lead the Bruins to a 23‚Äì9 victory over the Wildcats. Freshman Johnathan Franklin rushed for a career-best 119 yards on 23 carries and Kai Forbath kicked three field goals in the victory. Craft completed 13 of 24 passes with one interception including a game-clinching 51-yard scoring pass to Terrence Austin with 6:18 remaining. Josh Cherry kicked a 26-yard field goal in the first quarter and Daniel Thomas had a 7-yard run in the third quarter for the Wildcats (Ryan Doerr's PAT pass failed). UCLA's one lost fumble and eight penalties for 80 yards were the ugly part of the victory. The Wildcats had two fumbles and four penalties for 50 yards. Alterraun Verner had two interceptions and returned them for 47 yards for the Bruins. =Stanford= Entering the game, the Bruins were the only undefeated team in the Pac-10 Conference. Toby Gerhart, the Cardinal's 237-pound tailback who had 138 yards against UCLA last year, was averaging 129 yards a game. Kai Forbath kicked a 29-yard field goal after a fumble recovery to give the Bruins the early lead. Then Gerhart rushed for 5 yards for a touchdown for Stanford in the first quarter. Aided by a UCLA personal foul in the second quarter, Gerhart scored his second touchdown. A partially blocked punt allowed the Bruins to kick a field goal just before halftime. Using a 46-yard trick play in the third quarter to put Stanford in the red zone, Gerhart scored his third touchdown from the five-yard line. Unable to contain Gerhart, UCLA allowed Nate Whitaker to kick a 29-yard field goal for a 24-6 Stanford lead. The Bruins began the fourth quarter with a Johnathan Franklin 1-yard touchdown run. Forbath's 35-yard field goal reduced the Cardinal lead to 8 with about four minutes left. With Stanford failing to move the ball, UCLA took over with 3 minutes left but were unable to make a comeback win. =Oregon= After losing their first game to then #14 Boise State, the Ducks had won four straight games, over Purdue, Utah, California and Washington State. At game time, UCLA was leading the series, 39‚Äì23, since 1928. With a solid performance in the first half and taking a field goal lead into the locker room, the Bruins gave up three quick touchdowns within few minutes of the third quarter to give the Ducks their fifth win of the season. The Ducks scored on Kenjon Barner's 100-yard kickoff return, on Talmadge Jackson's 31-yard interception, and on Nate Costa's 20-yard pass to Jeff Maehl that was aided by a UCLA fumble. The Bruins scored their only touchdown when Akeem Ayers intercepted a Costa pass in the back of the Rose Bowl north end zone by keeping his feet in bounds. Kai Forbath kicked a 52-yard field goal to give UCLA the early lead. Oregon's Rob Beard attempted a 51-yard field goal, which was blocked by Jerzy Siewierski. Mogan Flint kicked a 33-yard field goal for the Ducks in the fourth quarter. =California= Quarterback Kevin Prince looks to pass during the Cal-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl Both teams were looking for their first conference win, after losing the first two. Cal head coach Jeff Tedford was looking for his first road victory in Southern California, having lost all seven games to the Los Angeles schools as Cal's coach. The Bears took advantage of the Bruins' mistakes and poor defensive performance to beat UCLA 45-26 for Tedford's first win in the Rose Bowl. Shane Vereen's 42 yard run and Marvin Jones' 43 yard pass from Kevin Riley were all the touchdowns the Bears needed in the first quarter. The scoring continued in the second quarter with Jahvid Best catching a 51-yard touchdown pass from Riley and running for a 93-yard touchdown. Shane Vereen finished with 154 yards in 17 carries and Marvin Jones caught two TD passes from Kevin Riley in his four receptions for a total of 89 yards. Giorgio Tavecchio kicked a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter and Mychal Kendricks returned a 68-yard touchdown interception for Cal in the fourth quarter with 5 minutes remaining in the game. Johnathan Franklin scored for UCLA with a 7-yard touchdown and a 74-yard touchdown, UCLA's longest scoring run in six years. As one of the best in the nation, Kai Forbath kicked four field goals, 24, 39, 46, and 35 yards. Quarterback Kevin Prince finished the game with 311 passing yards and that one interception in the fourth quarter. The Bruins had now lost three games in a row after starting the season with three victories, making it very difficult to have a winning season for Coach Rick Neuheisel. To save $100,000 in transportation cost, Cal took a bus from Berkeley on Thursday for the Southland. The long bus ride didn't have any ill effect on the Golden Bears during the hot 3-hour 24-minute game. Entertainment was provided by both schools' bands and high school bands from Southern California and one from Las Vegas. =Arizona= In the first quarter, Arizona's first drive ended when Rahim Moore intercepted a Nick Foles pass. But in their second drive, Nick Foles passed to Juron Criner for a 41-yard touchdown to give the Wildcats a lead. After Arizona recovered a Bruin fumble, Grigsby rushed into the end zone for a 6-yard touchdown, extra point blocked. Both Moore and Jerzy Siewierski intercepted a Wildcats pass in the second quarter. Kai Forbath kicked a 53-yard field goal to put UCLA on the board before the half. UCLA's Datone Jones recovered a Foles fumble and Forbath kicked a field goal to begin the third quarter. Kevin Craft came in to replace Kevin Prince in UCLA's second possession, but Christian Ramirez fumbled the ball to Arizona, which led to the Wildcats' third touchdown, a Nick Foles 25-yard pass to Juron Criner. Tony Dye recovered a Wildcats fumble and ran in for a 28-yard UCLA touchdown. Late in the third quarter, Nick Booth rushed for 6 yards for a score to give Arizona a 27‚Äì13 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Bruins were unable to do anything and lost their fourth game in a row. =Oregon State= Justin Kahut kicked two field goals, 48 yards and 42 yards, to give the Beavers a 6-point lead. Oregon State increased its lead to 13 when Jacquizz Rodgers passed to Brady Camp for a 14-yard touchdown. Kahut kicked another field goal to give the Beavers a 16‚Äì0 lead at the half. UCLA got on the board on Kai Forbath's 24-yard field goal in the third quarter. Kahut's fourth field goal attempt was short. Kahut kicked his fourth field goal (31 yards) in the fourth quarter to give the Beavers a 19‚Äì3 lead. A 58-yard pass to Nelson Rosario from Kevin Prince, combined with a 2-point conversion to Rosario, put UCLA back in the game, behind by only 8 points. Then Taylor Embree caught a touchdown pass from Prince and Johnathan Franklin caught a conversion pass to tie the game for the Bruins with 2 minutes left. But James Rodgers ran into the end zone for an Oregon State touchdown on a drive of 7 plays and 70 yards. UCLA took over the ball with 44 seconds remaining in the game and failed to make a complete comeback. The Bruins lost their fifth game in a row after winning their first three. =Washington= For this Homecoming game, the Bruins donned throwback jerseys, the 1967-style jerseys worn by honorary captain Gary Beban's team. The game was also the UCLA Veterans and Armed Forces Appreciation Day. Though they had five turnovers in the game, the Bruins did not lose their sixth conference game in a row. Kai Forbath kicked a 27-yard field goal early in the final period to win the game for the Bruins. Kevin Prince completed 13 of 17 passes for 212 yards and Kevin Craft had 10 of 14 completions for 159 yards. Both threw an interception. Wide receiver Nelson Rosario had seven receptions for 111 yards. With the Huskies down by a point, Erik Folk missed a 38-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter. Folk kicked three field goals, two in the second quarter, and Jermaine Kearse scored two pass-touchdowns in the game. Jake Locker completed 23 of 40 passes for 235 yards for Washington. Coach Rick Neuheisel still has not lost to his former teams, Colorado and Washington. =Washington State= After an interception, the Bruins scored on a pass touchdown from Kevin Prince to Taylor Embree on their first offensive play. =Arizona State= Andy Meyers, former offensive guard on UCLA's Pac-10 championship teams of 1997 and 1998, was the honorary captain for this Senior Day game. Eighteen seniors were playing in their last home game: DL Chinonso Anyanwu, WR Terrence Austin, DL Korey Bosworth, LB Kyle Bosworth, LB Reggie Carter, QB Kevin Craft, OL Nick Ekbatani, WR Gavin Ketchum, RB Chane Moline, TE Ryan Moya, TE Logan Paulsen, QB Osaar Rasshan, RB Craig Sheppard, DL Jerzy Siewierski, FB Trevor Theriot, CB Alterraun Verner, DL Jess Ward, DB Aaron Ware. =USC= This was the UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry game for the Victory Bell. Both teams wore home jerseys, in a tradition that had been restarted the previous year. The Bruins wore their 1966 throwback powder blue jerseys. The Trojans defeated the Bruins 28-7. With the Trojans leading 21-7 after a touchdown with 1:30 in the fourth quarter, and having possession of the ball after UCLA turned it over on downs, Coach Neuheisel called a timeout to stop the clock. The Trojans immediately connected on a 48-yard pass play for the fourth touchdown. =EagleBank Bowl= UCLA played Temple at the 2009 EagleBank Bowl at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. The bowl game was scheduled to start at 4:30 PM US EST on Tuesday, December 29, 2009. Navy defeated Army, allowing UCLA to play in its first bowl game since the 2007 Las Vegas Bowl. thumb The Temple Owls were making their first bowl game in 30 years, but it was ruined by the UCLA Bruins. The game time temperature started at freezing, with significant windchill, and only decreased from there. This led notable Temple alum Bill Cosby to flaunt his Owls' distinct weather advantage. The teams traded touchdowns early, but Temple built a big lead early, thanks to the play of the running back tandem of Bernard Price and Matt Brown. After trailing 21‚Äì10 at the half, UCLA converted a 4th and 1 pass to Terrence Austin into a touchdown to pull within 4. The game was won in the 4th quarter with a field goal by Kai Forbath, a 2-yard interception touchdown by Akeem Ayers, a two-point PAT catch by Nelson Rosario from Kevin Prince, and a safety from a bad snap on a Temple punt. Akeem Ayers was the MVP with several key tackles and the game-winning score, in which he fell attempting a pass rush, and was able to get up just in time to intercept the pass at the line of scrimmage and score easily. Awards and honors * At their annual awards banquet at the Hyatt Century Plaza Hotel, running back Chane Moline, safety Rahim Moore and defensive tackle Brian Price were selected winners of UCLA's Henry R. \\"Red\\" Sanders Award for most valuable players.

Artificial scarcity The term \\"hoarding\\" may include the practice of obtaining and holding resources to create artificial scarcity, thus reducing the supply, to increase the price, so that they can be sold to customers for profit. Fear- based hoarding Hoarding behavior is a common response to fear, whether fear of imminent societal collapse or a simple fear of a shortage of some good. Civil unrest or natural disasters may lead people to collect foodstuffs, water, gasoline, generators, and other essentials which they believe, rightly or wrongly, may soon be in short supply. There is often an implication that hoarding occurs because individuals do not believe that the market will operate efficiently in current or expected conditions. See preppers. Example A feature of hoarding is that it leads to an inefficient distribution of scarce resources, making the scarcity even more of a problem. An example occurs in cities where parking is inadequate. In such a case, businesses may post signs indicating that their lot is for their employees and customers only, and all other vehicles will be towed. This prevents businesses from allowing their parking to overflow into neighboring lots when their capacity is exceeded. Thus, when the capacity is reached at one business, there may be no legal place to park, while there would have been, if hoarding had not occurred. If a single business posted those signs, it would, indeed, improve the parking situation at that business, as they could continue to park at adjacent businesses, while the others could not park in their lot. However, when everybody posts such signs, the problem becomes worse for everyone. (This example assumes all of the lots are sometimes inadequate for their businesses; in a case where a business has sufficient parking for itself, but its lot is filled with customers from others, the signs would be beneficial to that business, even if others did the same.)http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/clr/pdfs/keith_sharfman.pdf The Law and Economics of Hoarding See also * Artificial scarcity * Cornering the market * Crisis in Venezuela * Currency crisis * Gresham's law * Greed vs Fear Index * Land banking * Panic buying * Price gouging * Societal collapse References Price controls Scarcity ","title":"Hoarding (economics)"},{"id":"21127403","text":"Fingal are an Irish traditional music band, based in the United States.

Known originally as Greenville Mall, it was redeveloped extensively starting in 2009. History The Magnolia Park Town Center was originally built as the Greenville Mall, in planning as early as 1974 when Montgomery Ward was secured as its first anchor. In 1976, J. B. White was secured as a second anchor, along with the mall as a whole being announced with a planned 78 stores. Ground was broken on August 10th, 1976, in a ceremony attended by Neal Ellis, president of mall developer First Hartford Realty, Edward Hale, president of J. B. White, James Wickert, southeastern real estate director for Montgomery Ward, and senator Richard Riley. At this time, it was announced the mall would be a total of 700,000 sq ft, and cost $15 million to build, with an estimated opening date of August 3rd, 1978. Plans for a third anchor store and a 3‚Äì4 screen movie theater were also announced at this time, as well as many of the interior tenants. The mall opened as planned on August 3rd, 1978, with anchors J. B. White and Montgomery Ward, as well as 37 interior tenants, and a two screen Plitt Theatres, drawing an estimated crowd of 25,000. In March 1994, J. B. White announced a major renovation, adding 40,000‚Äì50,000 sq ft in anticipation of a larger mall renovation, said to include a new anchor, Parisian. At this time, the mall, now owned by Intershop Real Estate Services, was more than 50% vacant, with only 25 open stores. Parisian, along with the construction of a new, two-story Montgomery Wards, were officially announced in May 1994, expected to open in May and March 1995, respectively. An expansion to the mall itself was announced in June 1994, to include a food court, a new theater (replacing the two-screen Cineplex Odeon theater which had closed in November 1991), and an additional wing, connecting to a unnamed fourth anchor. The expansion, planned to open in Spring 1995, would expand the mall to over 700,000 sq ft and include more upscale shops, fountains, interior landscaping, etched-glass skylights, and terracotta and green tile flooring to create \\"the look and beauty of Southern gardens\\". Montgomery Ward held a grand opening for what it called a \\"concept store\\" on May 5, 1995 in a ceremony attended by Montgomery Ward officials and NASCAR driver Cale Yarborough, following a soft-open earlier that week. It was followed by Parisian, who opened their store on May 21, in a ceremony presided over by president and CEO Donald E. Hess. Oshman's SuperSports USA was announced in June 1995, taking up a portion of the original Montgomery Ward building and set to open in Fall 1995. The mall, following its 14-month, $65 million renovation, reopened on August 31, 1995 with 19 new shops and restaurants and anchors Parisian, J.B. White, and Montgomery Ward, with 16 additional shops, including Oshman's SuperSports USA scheduled to open October 20th. Grand opening events held October 20th-22nd included a golf tournament inside Oshman's, a fashion show, kids events, an appearance by Miss South Carolina Amanda E Spivey, and a performance by the Greenville Symphony Orchestra and Dixie Carter. Dillard's came to the mall in 1998 with its acquisition of J. B. White parent Mercantile Stores Company, Inc.. Parisian converted to Proffitt's in February 1999. The mall took a serious hit in 2000, when Montgomery Ward filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and closed all stores. Dillard's announced the closure of their location at the mall, which by this time had converted one of its floors to a Clearance Center, in January 2003. 2004 would see the closure of Proffitt's and relocation of Williams-Sonoma to the nearby Haywood Mall, leaving Oshman's SuperSports USA as the only remaining major tenant. By 2005, Oshman's had been converted to Sports Authority. The mall was sold to Canyon Gulfside Greenville LLC, a group of Gulfside Development Co. principals and other investors, in December 2005 from previous owners DRA Advisors Inc. While the company had not finalized its plans, one of the principals, Jackson Ward, told The Greenville News that \\"It will slowly be wound down and demolished, more than likely, or a portion of it will be demolished.\\". In April 2006, initial redevelopment plans were announced, with the mall being entirely demolished, save for the thriving Hollywood 20-screen theater, for new retail with tenants including Rooms To Go, Costco, and Sports Authority. The addition of offices and housing, to create a mixed use development, were discussed, but not confirmed at this time. In May, the redeveloped property was named Magnolia Park Town Center, and was to include a 250,000 sq ft company headquarters in addition to the previously announced tenants and 15-20 additional stores, with a planned opening date of Spring 2008. However, these plans stalled due to the Great Recession, and Menin Development, the new owners of the partially-demolished mall, sat on the undeveloped property until plans picked back up in 2011. In early 2013, outdoor retail chain Cabela's announced they would be opening a new store on the site. The center was sold to by Menin Development to MetLife Core Property Fund in 2014, for more than $155 million. Dave & Buster's opened on November 17, 2014. , major tenants of the center include Golf Galaxy (formerly Golfsmith), Urban Air (formerly Toys \\"R\\" Us/Babies R Us), Nordstrom Rack, Cabela's, Regal Cinemas, and Dave & Buster's.

Nixon appointed Warren E. Burger to replace Earl Warren, and during his time in office appointed three other members of the Supreme Court: Associate Justices Harry Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell, and William Rehnquist. Nixon also nominated Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell for the vacancy that was ultimately filled by Blackmun, but the nominations were rejected by the United States Senate. Nixon's failed Supreme Court nominations were the first since Herbert Hoover's nomination of John J. Parker was rejected by the Senate. Politics While Nixon was a candidate for president, the sitting Chief Justice, Earl Warren, had long since become a lightning rod for controversy among conservatives: signs declaring \\"Impeach Earl Warren\\" could be seen around the country throughout the 1960s. The unsuccessful impeachment drive was a major focus of the John Birch Society.Political Research Associates, \\"John Birch Society\\" =Warren E. Burger nomination= Painting of Burger In 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement after 15 years on the Court, effective on the confirmation of his successor. President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to the position, but a Senate filibuster blocked his confirmation. With Johnson's term as President about to expire before another nominee could be considered, Warren remained in office for another Supreme Court term. In his presidential campaign, Nixon had pledged to appoint a strict constructionist as Chief Justice. Many speculated that President Richard Nixon would elevate sitting Justice Potter Stewart to the post, some going so far as to call him the frontrunner. Stewart, though flattered by the suggestion, did not want again to appear before and expose his family to the Senate confirmation process. Also, he did not relish the prospect of taking on the administrative responsibilities delegated to the Chief Justice. Accordingly, he met privately with the president to ask for his name to be removed from consideration. Nixon also offered the position to former New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who declined. Instead, in 1969, Nixon nominated Warren E. Burger to the Chief Justice position. Burger had first caught Nixon's eye when the magazine U.S. News and World Report had reprinted a 1967 speech that Burger had given at Ripon College, in which he compared the United States judicial system to those of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark: :I assume that no one will take issue with me when I say that these North European countries are as enlightened as the United States in the value they place on the individual and on human dignity. [Those countries] do not consider it necessary to use a device like our Fifth Amendment, under which an accused person may not be required to testify. They go swiftly, efficiently and directly to the question of whether the accused is guilty. No nation on earth goes to such lengths or takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do, once an accused person is called before the bar of justice and until his case is completed. Through speeches like this, Burger became known as a critic of Chief Justice Warren and an advocate of a literal, strict-constructionist reading of the U.S. Constitution. Nixon's agreement with these views, being expressed by a readily confirmable, sitting federal appellate judge, led to the appointment. The Senate confirmed Burger to succeed Warren by a vote of 74‚Äî3 on June 9, 1969. Senators Eugene McCarthy (DFL-MN), Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) and Stephen Young (D-OH) voted against the nomination. Senator J. William Fulbright (D-AR) simply voted \\"present.\\" In total, 22 senators did not vote on the nomination, with Minority Whip Hugh Scott (R-PA) noting that of the senators absent, Marlow Cook (R-KY), Hiram Fong (R-HI), Barry Goldwater (R-AZ), Jacob Javits (R-NY), George Murphy (R-CA), Charles Percy (R-IL) and Winston Prouty (R-VT) would have all voted to pass the nomination. Burger was sworn in as the new Chief Justice on June 23, 1969. =Harry Blackmun nomination= In 1969, Abe Fortas resigned from the Court due to conflict of interest charges, creating an opening for Nixon's second nomination to the Court. Nixon asked Lewis F. Powell, Jr. to accept a nomination to the Court at that time, but Powell demurred. On August 21, 1969, Nixon nominated Clement Haynsworth, then a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Haynsworth was opposed by Democrats (possibly in retaliation for the Republicans' rejection of Fortas as Chief Justice), Rockefeller Republicans, and the NAACP. He was alleged to have made court decisions favoring segregation and being reflexively anti-labor. Also, he was accused of ruling in cases where he had a financial interest, although this was never proven. His nomination was supported by the Washington Post, generally considered to be the \\"liberal\\" newspaper in Washington, D.C. Haynsworth was later termed a \\"moderate\\" who was \\"close in outlook to John Paul Stevens.\\" Haynsworth was defeated by a 55 to 45 vote on November 21, 1969. Nineteen Democrats ‚Äì of whom only Mike Gravel of Alaska represented a state outside the South ‚Äì and 26 Republicans voted for Haynsworth while 38 Democrats and seventeen Republicans voted against the nomination. Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee since John J. Parker (1930) to be defeated by the Senate. On January 19, 1970, Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell to the seat. Carswell was praised by Southern Senators including Richard B. Russell, Jr., but was criticized by others for the high reversal rate (58%) of his decisions as a District Court Judge. Civil-rights advocates also questioned his civil rights record; in 1948, Carswell had voiced support for racial segregation while running for a seat in the Georgia state legislature (in his hometown, Irwinton, Georgia; Carswell did not win the election and moved to Florida where he started his career as a private attorney). In defense against charges that Carswell was \\"mediocre\\", U.S. Senator Roman Hruska (R-NE) stated, \\"Even if he is mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a little chance?\\"A Seat for Mediocrity?, Time Magazine (March 30, 1970). That remark is believed to have backfired and damaged Carswell's cause. On April 8, 1970, the United States Senate refused to confirm Carswell's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. The vote was 51 to 45, with seventeen Democrats ‚Äì of whom only Alan Bible of Nevada represented a state outside the South ‚Äì and twenty-eight Republicans voting for Carswell. Thirteen Republicans, all but five from the Northeast, and thirty-eight Democrats voted against him. Nixon accused Democrats of having an anti-Southern bias as a result. On April 15, 1970, Nixon nominated Minnesotan Harry Blackmun to fill the Fortas vacancy. Blackmun was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 94‚Äî0 on May 12, 1970.Roll Call ‚Äì Nomination of Harry Blackmun, senate.gov Senators Birch Bayh (D-IN), Al Gore, Sr. (D-TN), Richard Russell, Jr. (D-GA), Barry Goldwater (R-AZ), Karl E. Mundt (R-SD), and John Tower (R-TX) did not vote. Majority Whip Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Minority Whip Robert P. Griffin (R-MI) made public note on the Senate floor that, out of the six senators not in attendance for the vote, all of them would have voted to confirm Blackmun. =Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist nominations= On August 28, 1971, Justice Hugo Black admitted himself to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Black subsequently retired from the Court on September 17, thereafter suffering a stroke and dying eight days later. At the same time, Justice John M. Harlan was suffering from deteriorating health, and he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971 (he died December 29, 1971). Nixon initially intended to nominate Virginia Congressman Richard Harding Poff, but before Nixon could formally nominate him, Poff withdrew. John Dean wrote that Poff actually made that decision based on concerns that he would thus be forced to reveal to his then-12-year-old son Thomas that he had been adopted. Poff's concern was that the child would be negatively affected by that kind of information if revealed before he was old enough to understand. In mid-October, Nixon's White House released a list of six potential candidates for the seat, to which Time Magazine responded with a scathing editorial,\\"The Nation: Nixon's Not So Supreme Court\\" (Monday, Oct. 25, 1971). stating that Nixon had an \\"opportunity to redress the embarrassment of his two unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations\\", but that the names released \\"demonstrated his inability or unwillingness to nominate renowned jurists to the highest tribunal in the land\\". The list included: West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, Arkansas attorney Hershel Friday, California appeals court judge Mildred Lillie, Fifth Circuit judge Paul Roney, Fifth Circuit judge Charles Clark, and District of Columbia judge Sylvia Bacon. Although Byrd's name was on the list, the White House had previously indicated that he was not a serious candidate for the seat. Nixon thereafter announced his intention to nominate Hershel Friday to fill Black's seat, and Mildred Lillie to fill Harlan's seat; Lillie would have been the first female nominee to the Supreme Court. Nixon relented after the American Bar Association found both candidates to be unqualified. Nixon then approached Lewis F. Powell, Jr., who had declined the nomination in 1969. Powell remained unsure, but Nixon and his Attorney General, John Mitchell, persuaded him that joining the Court was his duty to his nation. Powell and Assistant Attorney General William H. Rehnquist were both nominated on October 21, 1971. The Senate confirmed Powell by a vote of 89-1 on December 6, 1971.Roll Call ‚Äì Nomination of Lewis F. Powell, senate.gov Fred R. Harris (D-OK) was the only senator to oppose the nomination. Senators Wallace F. Bennett (R-UT), Peter H. Dominick (R-CO), David H. Gambrell (D-GA), Hubert Humphrey (DFL-MN), Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Jack Miller (R-IA), Frank Moss (D-UT), Karl E. Mundt (R-SD), Charles Percy (R-IL) and Robert Stafford (R-VT) did not vote. Majority Whip Robert Byrd (D-WV) announced that, out of the absent Democratic senators, Senators Gambrell, Humphrey, Inouye and Moss would have voted to confirm Powell. Minority Whip Robert P. Griffin (R-MI) announced that, out of the absent Republican senators, Senators Bennett, Dominick, Percy and Miller would have voted to confirm Powell. The Senate confirmation of Rehnquist, a law clerk for the late Justice Robert H. Jackson, was much more contentious. The loudest concerns were voiced by Senators Birch Bayh (D-IN) and Philip Hart (D-MI), who brought up that Rehnquist's nomination was opposed by a record number of unions and organizations, including the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, and the NAACP.Roll Call ‚Äì Nomination of William Rehnquist, senate.gov The Senate put the concerns to a vote on December 10, 1971, and Rehnquist's nomination passed by a vote of 68-26. Of the 26 senators voting to kill the nomination, nearly all were Democrat; only Clifford P. Case (R-NJ), Edward Brooke (R-MA) (the lone African-American senator at the time) and Jacob Javits (R-NY) jumped party lines in the vote. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT), after having previously voted \\"nay,\\" withdrew his vote as a goodwill gesture to Senator Charles Percy, who could not attend the vote; he would have voted \\"yea\\" and counteracted Mansfield's vote. In addition to Percy, Clinton P. Anderson (D-NM), Wallace F. Bennett (R-UT), Karl E. Mundt (R-SD) and Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) did not vote. Minority Whip Robert P. Griffin (R-MI) announced that Senator Smith would have voted to confirm Rehnquist. With both votes confirmed, Powell and Rehnquist were sworn in on January 7, 1972.

The fourteenth tropical cyclone and thirteen named storm of the season, Lowell formed out of a western side of a trough on September 6. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Lowell, peaking as a moderate tropical storm. It pass directly over Socorro Island and began a weakening trend. It weakened into depression before landfall in Baja California Sur and dissipated before striking Sonora. It later joined with a frontal boundary and Hurricane Ike which caused severe damage as far inland as Chicago. In all, the storm had caused 6 deaths and $15.5 million damage. Meteorological history The origin of Lowell began from a tropical wave that moved off Africa. The northern portion of the wave would form into Hurricane Hanna in the Atlantic. The southern portion of the wave separated and continued to move westward across the Caribbean and crossed Central America during August 27 and August 28. Later a trough with a weak low pressure area developed over southern Mexico, The area of low pressure was found embedded within a large area of scattered moderate and isolated strong convection. The initial low failed to develop but a new low formed on western side of the trough. A larger cyclonic circulation associated with the trough and induced a gradual increase in deep convection. The low level convection center was temporarily displaced from the convection, and a smaller embedded circulation developed and was eventually detached from the larger circulation. It is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 1200 UTC 6 September when it was centered about south of Manzanillo, Mexico. As convective banding formed, the depression gradually intensified and was upgraded a Tropical Storm Lowell six hours later. A deep-layer anticyclone over Mexico steered Lowell northwestward until September 8. However, strong upper-level winds on the south side of the anticyclone produced strong northeasterly to easterly wind shear over the tropical cyclone for several days. Due to the shear, the low level convection became exposed and sheared. despite this, Lowell slowly strengthened and reached a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h), it then passed near Socorro Island without any known damage. The shear had lessened over the system, but with stable and dry air, the storm begin to weaken. Lowell moved towards north and northeast due to a subtropical ridge northwest of the system. It downgraded to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC 10 September as it was moving north-northeastward about west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Thunderstorm activity near the center had increased slightly on 10 September. The circulation began to slowly spin down as it made landfall around Cabo San Lucas, Mexico at 0900 UTC 11 September. As it made landfall the mid to upper level winds left the low level center exposed form the thunderstorm activity. Lowell degenerated into an elongated surface trough that extended across the southern Gulf of California. It followed a squall line and a frontal boundary and quickly dissipated. The remnant low produced rain across Northwestern Mexico, it later joined Hurricane Ike and caused damage further inland. Preparations and Impact =Mexico= Tropical Storm Lowell nearing Baja California Peninsula on September 10 On September 9, 2100 UTC a Tropical Storm Watch was issued from Bahia Magdalena to Cabo San Lucas and ended on September 11 0900 UTC. Heavy rainfall from the remnants of Lowell caused streams and canals to overflow in the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa, leaving more than 26,500 people homeless. The cities of Navojoa, Benito Ju√°rez, Huatabampo, and Etchojoa were most affected. The government of Sonora has estimated the damage in that state at 200 million pesos (about 15.5 million US dollars). In its impact route to Baja California Sur, Tropical Storm Lowell causing heavy rains and strong waves, forcing the closure of the port of Cabo San Lucas and the suspension of at least two cruises from Los Angeles, California with more than 2 thousand passengers each. Impact in Baja California Sur, Tropical Storm Lowell causing heavy rains and strong waves, forcing the closure of the port of Cabo San Lucas and the suspension of at least two cruises from Los Angeles, California, with more than 2 thousand passengers each. In its advance, the weather with winds up to 95 kilometers per hour, wreaking havoc on the coast of the Pacific, from Sonora to Nayarit, where they established the green alert (phase approach) by the heavy rains and storm surges. The director of civil protection in Baja California Sur, Jose Gaj√≥n of the Toba, said that Lowell has a radius of 800 km so that the whole body is on alert green. Classes were suspended in Sinaloa, bad weather caused by the weather associated with a low pressure system, caused the closure of boating in the bay Altata and the port of Topolobampo. Flood victims evacuated. The Secretary of Administration and Finance, √ìscar Lara, said that permits were granted exemption from payment of toll motorway Culiac√°n-Las Brisas for vehicles, by flooding in the villages of the municipality of Navolato. In the city of Los Mochis, the mayor, Esteban Valenzuela, said the rain caused the suspension of classes in schools. In Nayarit, the excess water in the marshes and estuaries affect fishermen suffer low catches of shrimp. The State Civil Protection Unit in Sonora blue alert issued for 16 municipalities of the entity and the green alert for 13 locations in the south to the vicinity of Lowell. Recount Damage In Chihuahua, the rains over the past 15 days left six people dead, more than a thousand communities, 15 thousand hectares of crops flooded, 50 solitary and 43 other villages without drinking water. The secretary of Public Security, Javier Cardona Torres, said that after the declaration of emergency Parral and Valle de Allende, these municipalities will help the Natural Disaster Fund. Also released this instance support for municipalities Aldama Coyame, Ojinaga, San Francisco de Conchos, Camargo, La Cruz and Julimes. In Durango and Coahuila, after the opening of the floodgates of dams L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Francisco Zarco, Civil Protection authorities evacuated thousands of residents in the communities of Abasolo and Rodeo in Durango, while the Comarca Lagunera, Coahuila, was working in strengthening of the river Nazas board. =United States= The remnants of Lowell later merged with a frontal boundary over the central United States and caused heavy rainfall and flooding one to two days before the remnants of Hurricane Ike passed through the region. Heavy rainfall, including multiple 24-hour records, occurred from West Texas northeast to Kansas and northern Illinois and Indiana. Wichita, Kansas, measured a daily record 10.31 inches of rain on 12 September and broke the 24-hour rainfall record of 7.99 inches that had been held since 1911. Lubbock, Texas, measured a 24-hour record rainfall of 7.80 inches which broke the previous record of 5.83 inches set in October 1983. Chicago, Illinois, reported 6.64 inches at O‚ÄôHare International Airport, the highest one-day total since records began in 1871. This amount broke the previous daily record of 6.49 inches set in 1987. Numerous people were rescued from stranded vehicles as rainfall flooded city streets.

He joined the Union Army during the Civil War, serving on the Oregon frontier. During his military service, Sprague explored much of Southern Oregon. While building a road near Fort Klamath, Sprague led a party into the Cascade Mountains to investigate Crater Lake. His party was the first to descend the 800-foot caldera wall to reach the lake's shore. A month later, Sprague published an article highlighting the lake's unique beauty. Today, the Sprague River in southern Oregon bears his name. Early life Sprague was born on July 16, 1825 in Delaware, Ohio. His parents were Pardon and Mary (Meeker) Sprague. His father was stockman, hotel keeper, county sheriff, and state legislator. Sprague received a private education in a small school near his home. He later attended Ohio Wesleyan University in his home town.\\"Franklin B. Sprague\\", RootsWeb, Ancestry.com, www.rootsweb.ancestry.com, January 11, 2009. In 1850, Sprague moved to Oregon. He settled in Jackson County, where he opened a shop that built fanning-mills for winnowing grain. Sprague was the first manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest to produce modern winnowing machines. Like the majority of Oregonians at the time, Sprague was a strong supporter of the Union during the American Civil War.\\"Death of an Indian War Captain\\", Medford Mail, Medford, Oregon, 15 March 1895, p. 7. Military service In 1864, Sprague joined the Union Army, and was commissioned as a Captain in the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was given command of I Company,Alvord, Benjamin (Brigadier General), \\"Dispatch to Headquarter, Department of the Pacific\\", Headquarters District of Oregon, United States Army, Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory, February 23, 1865. and posted to Southern Oregon. He participated in a number of skirmishes with the Northern Paiute and other Indian bands in southeastern Oregon. In addition to fighting Indians, Sprague learned to speak their languages and counted many Indians among his friends, including the Modoc chief known as Captain Jack. Captain Sprague was well respected as a leader, and often led detachments of cavalry as well as infantrymen. In October 1865, Sprague was leading a patrol of eleven cavalry troopers from C Company of the 1st Oregon Cavalry south of Warner Lake in present-day Lake County, Oregon, when they were ambushed by approximately 125 Indians in two groups. Sprague and his troops were caught between a lake, high cliffs, and the two groups of Indians. After exchanging long-range gun fire with the Indians, Sprague determined that while the Indian in front of him had guns, those behind him had only bows and arrows. He quickly ordered his men to charge to the rear. His men broke through the Indian's skirmish line and made a successful escape with no casualties.Bancroft, Hubert Howe, History of Oregon, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, California, 1888, p. 517.Michno, Gregory, The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864-1868, Caxton Press, Caldwell, Idaho, 2007, pp. 124-125.Edwards, Glenn Thomas, Oregon Regiments in the Civil War Years: Duty on the Indian Frontier, unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Department of History, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, June 1960. Crater Lake Sprague and twenty men from Company I were assigned to build a road linking the Rogue River with the existing John Day road. This connected Jacksonville and southwest Oregon with John Day's mining country. After the construction work was completed, Sprague published a list of the best camp sites along the road in the Jacksonville newspapers so that the wagon masters could find the best water and grass along the way.Greene, Linda, \\"Captain Franklin B. Sprague\\", Historic Research Study Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, Cultural Resources Branch, Denver Service Center, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Denver, Colorado, June 1984. On August 1, 1865, two hunters from Sprague's road construction crew rediscovered Crater Lake, which had been first visited in 1853, but was never effectively recorded so that others could locate it. Based on directions from his hunters, Sprague and five other men visited the lake on August 12. They climbed down the 800-foot caldera cliff to become the first explorers to reach the lake shore. Sprague's account of the visit was reported to Jacksonville's leading newspaper, the Oregon Sentinel on August 25. Wizard Island and Crater Lake's calderaBlue waters continually change shades Sprague's report was published in the Oregon Sentinel on September 9, 1865. It included several significant observations. First, Sprague identified the volcanic origins of the lake. His report described Wizard Island, and observed it was a remnant of volcanic activity. Second, his description of the lake's unique beauty was thoughtful and eloquent.Unrau, Harlan D. and Stephen R. Mark, \\"Discovery And Exploration Of Crater Lake: 1853-1885\\" , Administrative History, Crater Lake National Park, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, 15 July 1986. Sprague also predicted that the lake would \\"be visited by thousands hereafter.\\" Finally, he recommended that the lake not be named after its discoverer, saying: \\"I do not know who first saw this lake, nor do I think it should be named after the discoverer.\\" Sprague suggested it be called \\"Lake Majestic.\\" Today, it is known as Crater Lake. Since he was the first to identify the lake's volcanic origin, Sprague deserves some credit for the name. Later life On July 19, 1867, Captain Sprague and the men of Company I were mustered out of the Army. They were the last members of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment to be released from active duty.Official Army Register of the Volunteer Forces of the United States Army for the Years 1861, '62, '63, '64, '65 (Part VII), Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, California, Kansas, Oregon, Nevada., Adjutant General's Office, Secretary of War, Washington, D.C., March 2, 1865. In 1868, Sprague returned to Delaware County, Ohio. He settled in Sunbury, where he started a grain milling business. In 1875, Sprague ran as the Democratic Party's candidate for Delaware County Probate Judge, and was elected. He was easily re-elected in 1878, completing his term in 1882. Sprague died on February 7, 1895. He is buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Delaware, Ohio. Legacy Sprague played an important part in the early history of Crater Lake National Park. His exploration party was the first to reach the lake's shore. He was the first to identify the lake's volcanic origin, and his article in the Oregon Sentinel generated public interest in Crater Lake's unique beauty. In addition, Sprague explored much of Southern Oregon. The Sprague River is named after him. The Sprague River Valley, the town of Sprague River, and Sprague River Park in Fremont National Forest near Bly, Oregon also derive their names from Franklin Sprague.McArthur, Lewis A., McArthur, Lewis L., Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, pp.904.

Slightly set back from the intersection of the wharfs of the shipbuilders and the fishermen, the church is striking for its picturesque location on the bank of the Ill river, the lopsided character of its exterior, and its sumptuous interior combining the Gothic and Baroque styles. Since the end of the 19th century, the excellent acoustics of the church has allowed it to serve as a venue for concerts of classical music, in particular for the Passions of Johann Sebastian Bach. History of the Saint William's Church =Catholic period= Returning unharmed from the Crusades, the knight Henri de M√ºllenheim undertook the construction of a monastery for the Hermits of Saint William, an order of mendicant monks, in this marshy neighbourhood situated extra muros, that is, beyond the city walls. The elongated building, consecrated in 1301 and realised in 1307, is the only remnant of this group. Entirely brick and unvaulted, the church corresponds well to the ideal of the order, namely by its single nave and the simplicity of its exterior form. Sheltered by a pitched roof, its nave is topped and prolonged by a deep polygonal choir illuminated by high windows, which betrays its original function as the monks' meeting room. In 1331, by reason of its proximity to the port and wharfs, the church was chosen as parish by the newly established corporation of shipbuilders. =Lutheran period= The convent closed however, during the less than prosperous 15th century, before the reform movement arrived at the end of the century. The Church, including the Rood screen was classified a Monument historique in 1985. The Wilhelmer Choir Founded in 1885 by the organist Ernst M√ºnch (1859‚Äì1928) the Wilhelmer Choir, also known as the 'Ch≈ìur de Saint-Guillaume' has established itself as one of the leading choirs of the region. It has been led by several famous choirmasters, including Wilhelm Furtwangler, John Eliot Gardiner and Charles and Fritz Munch the sons of the founder of the choir.

United Nations facilities A United Nations inquiry into attacks on UN personnel or facilities during the Gaza War concluded that Israel had fired on U.N. personnel or facilities on eight separate incidents. The Board found no evidence that U.N. facilities had been used to launch attacks against the IDF. However, the Board's findings conclude only that violation of the inviolability of U.N. premises had occurred; its report does not make legal findings and does not consider whether laws of armed conflict were breached, as acknowledged by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The Israeli Government report notes that indeed the test applied by the UN Inquiry Board was merely whether the physical premises of U.N. facilities had been affected and not whether the Laws of Armed Conflict were violated.FACTUAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS , IMFA, July 2009 The IDF conducted its own probe into claims regarding incidents where UN and international facilities were fired upon and damaged. The findings published argue that in all the cases investigated, the damage resulted either from retaliatory fire or from misuse of the UN vehicles by Hamas militants and that there were no deliberate intentions to hit UN facilities. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations would consult with Israel to improve their lines of communication to prevent future attacks on U.N. personnel and facilities. Ban plans to seek compensation from Israel for the damage to U.N. property, estimated at $11 million. Mirit Cohen, an Israeli spokeswoman, said that Israeli military inquiries proved beyond doubt that the IDF did not intentionally fire at any U.N. installations. The U.N. board of inquiry urged Israel to withdraw charges that Palestinians had fired from inside U.N.-run schools and U.N. relief offices. Israeli officials said they had already done so in their military inquiry. =Al-Fakhura school attack, 6 January 2009= Al-Fakhura school attack, was an incident in which it was initially reported that Israeli forces had shelled a UNRWA school on January 6, 2009 and killed upwards of 30 people. At the time, the incident drew widespread condemnation from around the world. Reports from The Globe and Mail as well as Haaretz concluded that no one was killed inside the school in contradiction to a report from a separate branch of the UN. UNRWA responded that it had maintained from the day of attack \\"that the shelling and all of the fatalities took place outside and not inside the school.\\" =UNRWA Asma Elementary School, 5 January 2009= Following the investigation into the incident, the U.N. Board concluded that Israel intentionally struck a U.N.-run school, exhibiting a \\"reckless disregard for the lives and safety\\" of civilians; three civilians were killed. The Israeli Government report claims that the UN Inquiry acknowledged that \\"information regarding the School functioning as a shelter for civilians was provided by the U.N. to IDF only on 6 January 2009, the day after the incident had occurred. A list of facilities serving as shelters ‚Äî provided by the U.N. one day earlier on 4 January 2009 ‚Äî did not include UNRWA Asma School\\". However, earlier that day, UNRWA apparently had opened the school as an emergency shelter, after it had been closed for nine days prior the incident. IDF‚Äôs investigation of the incident revealed that on the night of 5 January, a unit of militants was present in Asma School site. Supposedly without being aware that civilians were present in the site, the IDF targeted the unit. =UNRWA Field Office Compound, 15 January 2009= On January 15, the IDF shelled a storage facility within the compound of the UN headquarters for Gaza, containing tons of food and sheltering hundreds of Palestinian refugees. According to United Nations personnel, unexploded ordnance analysis demonstrates that the compound was hit with 155m white phosphorus ammunition. The facility did not have the equipment to extinguish the chemical fire and it spread towards several fuel tanks. The UN asked the IDF for a local ceasefire in order to try to put out the fires, but the request was denied. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon expressed \\"strong protest and outrage\\". An Israeli Defence Spokesperson was quoted as saying \\"We regret that such an incident occurred, I am sorry for it however Hamas fired rockets and troops received fire coming from within the site.\\" The United Nations has dismissed the Israeli explanation as \\"total nonsense\\". A senior UN official who was inside the building when it was attacked also denounced the Israeli statements as false and said that there were only non combatants in the building.Gaza doctor refutes casualties reported in Cast Lead op , Haaretz, 23 January 2009 The report from Israeli Government quotes findings of the UN Board Inquiry into the incident: the Board \\"was not within its scope to assess general allegations or denials\\" regarding \\"possible military activity close to United Nations premises and possible military use of nearby buildings\\". The Israeli position on this incident is that the incident \\"took place during intense fighting, which involved Hamas‚Äô deployment of anti-tank units equipped with advanced anti-tank missiles north of the UNRWA compound\\", which posed threat to IDF forces in the area. IDF implemented an effective smokescreen as a protective measure in response, anticipating only \\"limited risk to civilians in relation to this operational advantage\\". Civilians and civilian infrastructure The IDF said civilian buildings in the Gaza Strip were destroyed during Operation Cast Lead due to \\"substantial operational needs\\" citing examples of buildings being booby-trapped, located over tunnels, or used by combatants to fire from. =Civilians= In Israel During the conflict, life in much of southern Israel was paralyzed by Hamas rocket and mortar fire. According to HRW, during the Gaza War, rocket attacks placed up to 800,000 Israeli civilians within range of attack. During the war, rockets reached major Israeli cities Ashdod, Beersheba and Gedera for the first time, putting one-eighth of Israel's population in rocket range. As of January 13, 2009, Palestinian militants had launched approximately 565 rockets and 200 mortars at Israel since the beginning of the conflict, according to Israeli security sources.Yair Yanga, \\"Shin Bet: Some 565 rockets, 200 mortar shells fired at Israel since start of Gaza op\\" , Ha'aretz 13-01-2009 Besides the rockets fired by the Qassam Brigades of Hamas, other factions claimed responsibility for rockets fired into Israel and attacks on Israeli soldiers, including Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades (affiliated with Fatah), the Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades (armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine), the Quds Brigades and the Popular Resistance Councils. A Fatah official stated that the rocket attacks by his faction contradicted the official position of Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah leader and President of the Palestinian National Authority. Abbas had called on all sides to cease hostilities unconditionally. Militants fired over 750 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel during the conflict. Bersheeba and Gedera were the furthest areas hit by rocket or mortars. The rockets killed three civilians and one IDF soldier and wounded 182 people, with another 584 people suffering from shock and anxiety syndrome. The rockets also caused property damage, including damage to three schools.ynetnews Rocket barrages hit Beersheba, Ashkelon; 5 lightly hurt , December 31, 2008Rockets reach Beersheba, cause damage , YNET, December 30, 2008.Rocket lands near Ashdod kindergarten; no injuries , YNET, January 11, 2009. Senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar stated during the operation \\"they [Israeli forces] shelled everyone in Gaza.... They shelled children and hospitals and mosques, ... and in doing so, they gave us legitimacy to strike them in the same way.\\" Human Rights Watch noted in the open letter to Ismail Haniyeh that despite his Foreign Ministry stance as part of response to the Goldstone Report, Palestinian armed groups remain responsible for firing rockets indiscriminately or deliberately at Israeli civilian objects. HRW also noted that Palestinian militants put Palestinian civilians at risk of Israeli counter-attacks by launching rockets from populated areas. In the Gaza Strip BBC News stated on January 14 that the agency and the Israeli human rights group B'tselem have received claims from Gaza civilians that IDF forces fired on Gaza residents trying to escape the area. Israel has strongly denied the allegations, and dismissed B'tselem's report as \\"without foundation\\". The BBC reported speaking to members of a family who say they were shot at as they tried to leave to replenish dwindling water and food supplies during the three-hour humanitarian lull.

The Center for International Performance and Exhibition (colloquially called HotHouse), was founded by Marguerite Horberg in 1987 at 1565 N. Milwaukee Ave, Chicago. In 1995, following the gentrification of the locality, Wicker Park, the venue, with support from the MacArthur Foundation, moved to a second floor space at 31 E. Balbo Ave. The venue had a large main room with booths and dance floor with a room for catered events and art shows and put on a varied and inclusive programme of music. Performers at the Hothouse included Roscoe Mitchell, Gil Scott-Heron, Maria Rita, Henry Threadgill, Susie Ibarra, Savina Yannatou, Dewey Redman and Olu Dara. Since 2007, HotHouse has organized over 100 programs as itinerant presenters and has produced a number of year- long thematic and multi-disciplinary events such as the WPA 2.0, A Brand New Deal, The African Jubilee and Old and New Dreams. HotHouse has been awarded with many of the top honors in the Arts and Culture industry including: Best of Chicago, Chicagoan of the Year, and The Abbey. The HotHouse is also a forum for social issues and would host a benefit or offer support on issues such as the rights of undocumented workers or hurricane Katrina.

Early life Duhan's father was secretary to General Turenne before emigrating to Brandenburg in 1687. He educated Jacques himself while preparing him for a career as a soldier. The exceptional bravery of Duhan during the 1715 Siege of Stralsund caught the attention of Frederick William I, who was looking for a soldier rather than an academic to serve as civil tutor to his eldest son, the Crown Prince Frederick. Not knowing that Duhan was, in fact, a scholar well versed in ancient literature and modern philosophy, the King selected him as Frederick's tutor. Tutor to Crown Prince Frederick Frederick William drew up an elaborate schedule for the Prince's education, cutting out studies of poetry, philosophy, and ancient history in favor of an increased concentration on religion and modern political history. In spite of the king's orders, Duhan, over the twelve years of his service, continually scaled back the prince's religious education in favor of Greek, Roman, and French literature. He secretly secured for Frederick a private library of some three thousand volumes, housed at the Schlossfreiheit, and even went so far as to procure articles of French clothing for the young prince,Asprey, 21. items strictly forbidden by Frederick's francophobic father. Banishment After Frederick's failed attempt to flee Prussia, Duhan's role in acquiring a private library for Frederick was discovered and, combined with Frederick William's general desire to punish anybody closely associated with the crown prince, this resulted in the banishment of Duhan.Mitford, 64 He was exiled to a tower in the Baltic Coast city of Memel, without pension.MacDonogh, 37 Frederick, while imprisoned at K√ºstrin, arranged through the Austrian ambassador General Seckendorff to have Austria pay a secret pension to Duhan.Asprey, 93 Then, after his release, Frederick secured Duhan a librarian position in Brunswick.MacDonogh, 103 Directorship of Liegnitz Upon Frederick's becoming King of Prussia in 1740, Duhan was appointed director of the Liegnitz Academy in Silesia. Frederick outlined his duties: \\"to peacefully draw your salary, to love me, and to enjoy yourself.\\" quoted in MacDonogh, 134. He continued his regular correspondence with Frederick throughout the Silesian Wars. Death Frederick returned from victory in the Second Silesian War to news of Duhan's grave illness. The victorious king attended the death bed of his old tutor, and in early January 1746 Jacques Duhan died, attended by Frederick and various princes of Prussia. His sister was given a lifelong pension by Frederick in recognition of Duhan's long service.MacDonogh, 178  References  1685 births 1746 deaths French exiles Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences ","title":"Jacques Duhan de Jandun"},{"id":"21128358","text":"Location of Harrison County in Kentucky This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Harrison County, Kentucky.

The town's name means \\"Arabian Shore\\" in swahili,More specifically, the word \\"manga\\" refers to Muscat (Omani) arabs; arabs born in Zanzibar are called mwarabu. See W.H. Ingrams, Zanzibar, Its History and Its People p. 205, a name which probably dates from the black- market slavery days of the 1840s to 1880s. The shoreline here contains numerous caves, some of which were used for holding slaves at that time. Among the caves is a popular attraction, the Coral Cavern, which is located two kilometres south of the town. Footnotes References *Finke, J. (2006) The Rough Guide to Zanzibar (2nd edition).

He is currently the head coach of Malaysia Super League side Pahang.  Playing career  Dollah was one of Malaysia's top footballers in the 80's and 90's. He with striking partner \\"the King\`\` Zainal Abidin Hassan were regarded as the twin strikers by the local football fans. Dollah first played in Malaysian football in 1982. At that time he represented Johor, which was one of the teams in the semi-pro era. When Dollah joined the Selangor in 1987, a new twin striker was born after the era of Hassan Sani and James Wong. He and Zainal became the fierce striking partner for both Selangor and the Malaysia national team. In 1991, he left Selangor to join Pahang with Zainal and Singapore football star Fandi Ahmad where they create a 'dream team' and manage to win both league and Malaysia Cup in 1992. With the national team, Dollah won the gold medal in the 1989 Southeast Asian Games. He also helped the national team to win the 1993 Merdeka Tournament by beating South Korea 3‚Äì1. Dollah also played in the first edition of ASEAN Football Championship, where the national team manage to go through the final of the competition but losing 0‚Äì1 to Thailand. He also played for Malaysia national futsal team, and was in the squad that took part in the 1996 FIFA Futsal World Championship in Spain. Dollah retired as a player after the 1998 season ended. The last team he represented was Negeri Sembilan.  Coaching career  Dollah started his coaching career with Selangor MPPJ in 2003. The same year he guided the team to become the first ever club to win Malaysia Cup by beating Sabah 3‚Äì0. He later guided Selangor MPPJ to win the Malaysia Charity Shield and Malaysia Premier League in 2004. In 2005, Selangor signed a long deal with him. That year, Selangor won three trophies, Malaysia Premier League, Malaysia FA Cup, and Malaysia Cup. However, in 2005‚Äì06 season, Selangor failed to keep their momentum as they failed to win any trophy. Even though Selangor failed to win any trophy, Selangor kept Dollah in charge for 2006‚Äì07 season. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw the revival of Selangor as they went through to the final of Malaysia FA Cup and Malaysia Cup. However they were beaten by Kedah with the same score line in the two finals. The failure saw Dollah left out by the management. In 2009 season, Dollah reunited with his Zainal. This time they played the role as manager and coach for Kuantan Port-Shahzan Muda. In the middle of the 2009 season, he switched to coach Pahang, replacing Tajuddin Noor. After successfully helping Pahang lift the first Malaysia Cup in 21 years, Dollah signed to coach PDRM for 2014 season in Malaysian second-tier league. In his only season with PDRM, he guided them to the 2014 Malaysia Premier League title and promotion to Super League. Dollah was appointed as the new head coach of Malaysia national team in June 2014, signing a 2-year contract. He led Malaysia to win second place during the 2014 AFF Championship. However, he received many criticisms as he was responsible for the 0‚Äì6 defeats at the hands of Palestine and Oman, the team failure to get three points against Timor Leste, Bangladesh and Hong Kong as well losing to Tajikistan and Syria that were once at the same standard as Malaysia earlier in 2014. His last straw was the largest record defeat of the national team by 0‚Äì10 at the hand of United Arab Emirates. This subsequently causing him to resign as the head coach on 3 September 2015.

The band has toured internationally with bands such as 13 & God, Freezepop, and Lymbyc Systym. Allmusic lists some contemporary comparisons as The Postal Service and Mobius Band. History Alexander Chen's recording career began when he sent a demo to Markus Acher of The Notwist, who had recently started his own record label Alien Transistor. A few months later, he received an email from Acher. They met at The Notwist show in Boston. They decided to release his debut album, Newborn. Chen mastered the album at Abbey Road Studios and it was released in 2004. In 2005, Boy in Static supported 13 & God, an alternative hip hop group composed of Themselves and The Notwist, opening for their European and US tours. For their Irving Plaza show, Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, \\"amid the echoes of 1980's bands like New Order, Mr. Chen revealed a strong sense of melody and his own blend of diffidence, longing and tenacity.\\" Boy in Static's second album Violet was released on Mush Records in May 2007. It was described as \\"an impressive one-man symphony\\" by The Boston Globe and \\"a ballad of electronic snaps and true dream-pop vocals\\" by URB. Many magazines noted its influences by 1990s shoegaze bands such as Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine, with its \\"Loveless fascination\\" (Remix). In 2007 and 2008, Boy in Static toured with the band Freezepop. Both Chen and Ross also performed as members of Freezepop on this tour. Boy in Static released the third album, Candy Cigarette, on Fake Four Inc and Circle Into Square in 2009.

Christian Renatus, affectionately known as Christel, took his father‚Äôs marriage religion (Ehereligion) literally, proclaiming himself to be the living \\"Sidewound of Christ\\" in 1748, which meant he was the embodiment of Christ's sacrificial and compassionate love. The younger Zinzendorf and his co-elder of the Single Brethren, Joachim Rubusch, also proclaimed themselves to be married to the Sidewound. This derived in part from the teaching of Zinzendorf‚Äôs father that all souls are female, regardless of gender, so that they may be married to Christ. (This image is derived from the fact that \\"soul\\" in German, die Seele, is always a feminine noun.[Cassel's German-English Dictionary, entry die Seele.] It was also in 1748 that Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf declared all Single Brethren to be Sisters and therefore Brides of Christ. The compounding of sexuality and spirituality at Herrnhaag led to virulent attacks from outside and within the church, threatening to undo the goodwill with other denominations that the elder Zinzendorf had sought for decades. He dismissed his son from his positions and brought him to England for the remaining three years of Christian's life. After his death, Christian's followers in Pennsylvania named a settlement farm after him. Since there was a flowing spring there it was called \\"Christiansbrunn\\", Christian's Spring. while church leaders systematically destroyed most of the documents referring to the events at Herrnhaag. Only within the past two decades has a new generation of scholars and historians begun to reexamine that period to determine what happened. Herrnhaag about the time it was under the leadership of Christian Renatus. Birth and formative years Zinzendorf was born just a month after the spiritual awakening experience on August 13, 1727, that signaled the renewal of the Ancient Unity of Brethren, in which Moravian exiles on the lands of his father committed themselves to a life in Christ. Both his parents were deeply committed to this ideal. His father and his mother, n√©e Countess Erdmuthe Dorothea Reuss-Ebersdorf, came from Pietist families that stressed the indwelling of the spirit. His parents considered their relationship to be a marriage of champions in which the goal was serving Christ.Geiger, Erika (2006) Erdmuth Dorothea - Countess von Zinzendorf - Noble Servant. Winston- Salem: John F. Blair. pp. 13. The young Zinzendorf was left in the care of his mother for most of his youth while his father pursued church activities elsewhere. His effeminacy was noted by nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century historians who typically attributed it his being raised in the company of women: \\"Christian Renatus . . . had all the ardor without the virility characteristic of his father.\\" Levering, Joseph Mortimer. (1903) A History of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 1741-1892. Bethlehem: Times Publishing Company. pp. 187. The strong mother/weak or distant father parenting style typically associated with early psychoanalytic attempts to explain homosexuality was also used to further discredit Zinzendorf. As a student, Zinzendorf was known for being frivolous, even bringing a cat to class. At the age of sixteen, he was named vice-elder of the Single Brothers Choir. Moravian communities were dedicated to serving Christ. The traditional family unit was abandoned in order to direct all residents' energies to that goal. Much like the Shakers, Moravian residents lived in groups or choirs according to gender, marital status and age. Christel as Christ's representative Many of Zinzendorf's beliefs and acts were based upon his father's words: \\"I live no more; he lives in me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, and when you have a word from me, so too you have it from him.\\" Craig D. Atwood, (1995) Blood, Sex, and Death: Life and Liturgy in Zinzendorf‚Äôs Bethlehem. Ph.D. diss., Princeton Theological Seminary. pp. 49. Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, painting and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen (broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice. The idea of Christ living in another was not uncommon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is a fundamental belief shared with the Quakers and Shakers, who also had roots in Pietism and the indwelling of Christ. Mid-18th-century engraving with the (translated) words \\"The lovely poem/which one can see from his forehead/is the simple story/that our lord departed.\\" Leadership and loss of leadership Herrnhaag was a community designed by the elder Zinzendorf, whose inhabitants were to live under the direct rule of Christ with Christian Renatus as his representative. At Herrnhaag, Christel was the link between the spiritual and the earthly as the spirit took human form. During the 1748 Single Brothers Festival at Herrnhaag, Christel and his assistants entered wearing white robes, implying it was Christ who was actually entering. Later that day, Christel and twelve assistants led Communion, further representing Christ and the apostles. During the service, those in attendance believed that the Sidehole of Christ was literally standing before them in the bodily forms of Christel and Rubusch, his co-leader of the brothers. Christel sang a welcoming hymn for Christ entering the hall, and while kissing, the brothers believed they were literally kissing the Sidehole.Peucker. pp. 47. The combination of sexuality and spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly embarrassing for Nicholas, \\"who was trying to be recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg\\" in 1748.Hergemoeller, Bernd-Ulrich. (1999) \\"Nikolaus Ludwig von and Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf,\\" Mann fuer Mann. Hamburg: M√§nnerschwarm. pp 765. Translated by Hilke Kuhlmann. Even Christel‚Äôs mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that \\"I sometimes said we have already put the peg in the last hole. If we wanted to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down.\\"Geiger. pp. 84. In addition to increasingly embarrassing scandal and rumor, the cost of sustaining Herrnhaag and its numerous festivals put a severe financial strain on the church at a time when its missionary efforts were expanding around the world. Events reached such a point that Christel‚Äôs father denounced what was happening at Herrnhaag and ordered Christel to attend him in England. \\"When the twenty-two-year-old returned to Herrnhaag, he was physically and mentally broken. In August 1750 he founded a Bund auf die Marter Gottes (Covenant on the ordeal of God). During this 'phase of consolation' ordered by his father, he also composed several 'purified' poems.\\"Hergemoeller. pp. 765. Death and apotheosis Zinzendorf died in a house in Dean's Yard of Westminster Abbey, London, on May 28, 1752, from a hemorrhage due to tuberculosis, with John Nitschmann, his former tutor, beside him. He was buried on the grounds of Lindsey House, \\"Sharon,\\" the Moravian Graveyard located in Chelsea outside London, where his father lived at that time while directing the worldwide missionary effort of the church. When the Moravian Brethren and Sisters refused to forswear their allegiance to the elder Zinzendorf and sever their connection to the Moravian Church in the 1750s at the insistence of Gustav Friedrich, Count of Isenburg-B√ºdingen, Herrnhaag was closed and a great number of Moravians came to Bethlehem and Nazareth in Pennsylvania. A farming community had already been established near Nazareth for the Single Brethren named Christiansbrunn, Christian's Spring. One of the brothers wrote a poem stating that Christel lived again in the Congregation at the spring and that the flowing waters restored him ‚Äúmore and more.‚Äù Dennis Glew, ‚ÄúChristian Wedstedt‚Äôs Journey from London to Pennsylvania, June 13-September 14, 1753,‚Äù Unitas Fratrum, 10 (1981), 86-96. Historical perspective For more than 200 years after his death, Christel was looked upon as a failure by Moravian historians and scholars, who saw him as weak, effeminate, ineffectual and a grave disappointment to his father whose trust he had betrayed. The only way most Moravians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries knew him was by the inclusion of several of his hymns in various Moravian hymnals, the most famous being ‚ÄúMy Redeemer, overwhelmed with anguish, went to Olivet for me.‚Äù Indeed, the entire period (approximately 1747-1749) became known as the \\"Sifting Time\\" from Luke 22:31: \\"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat.\\" Nicholas Zinzendorf called the ensuing scandal an ‚Äúunbridled freedom of the flesh.‚Äù Peucker. pp. 63. His representative told the residents at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn that it was impossible to be \\"truly unified with our Husband\\" while living on earth. He further added that the residents had mistaken metaphor for reality and wrongly believed that the brothers were actually sisters. Historians for the next two hundred years accepted this view of events and wrote off what happened as a time of embarrassing excess from which the church was saved only by the timely intervention of Nicholas. Determining exactly what happened was made exceedingly difficult due to extensive destruction of documents amounting to official censorship that began in the eighteenth century by church officials and even archivists. There was a general shunning of the period that lasted well into the twentieth century, and almost no pertinent documents remain in either in the major Moravian archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania or Herrnhut, Germany. A new generation of scholars and historians interested in determining exactly what happened have been able to locate documents in private collections and other sources. An indication of renewed interest in Christian Renatus and what he meant to his time was shown in September, 2008 when a birthday festival was held in his honor in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania based on eighteenth-century sources and sponsored by the Historic Bethlehem Partnership, the Moravian Music Foundation and the Moravian Archives.

Tillman, Charles Tillman, Charlie Tillman, and C. D. Tillman‚Äîwas a popularizer of the gospel song. He had a knack for adopting material from eclectic sources and flowing it into the mix now known as southern gospel, becoming one of the formative influences on that genre.See southern gospel and James David Vaughan. The youngest son of Baptist preacher James Lafayette Tillman and Mary (Davis) Tillman, for 14 years prior to 1887 he painted houses, sold sheet music for a company in Raleigh, North Carolina, and peddled Wizard Oil.For a description of Wizard Oil, see Hamlin's Wizard Oil and site tabs. Note its association with songbooks. In 1887 he focused his career more on his church and musical talents, singing first tenor in a church male quartet and establishing his own church-related music publishing company in Atlanta.William Jensen Reynolds, Companion to Baptist Hymnal (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1976), p. 444, . \\"Old-Time Religion\\" In 1889 Tillman was assisting his father with a tent meeting in Lexington, South Carolina. The elder Tillman lent the tent to an African American group for a singing meeting on a Sunday afternoon. It was then that young Tillman first heard the spiritual \\"The Old Time Religion\\" and then quickly scrawled the words and the rudiments of the tune on a scrap of paper. Tillman published the work to his largely white church market in 1891.William Jensen Reynolds, Hymns of Our Faith (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1964), p. 423. Reynolds gives the date of the tent meeting as 1891, but it is elsewhere widely indicated by others as 1889; the confusion may be that Tillman published it in his Revival songbook for 1891, where it appears as Item 223. Tillman was not first in publishing the song, an honor which goes to G. D. Pike in his 1873 Jubilee Singers and Their Campaign for Twenty Thousand Dollars.(Nashville: Lee And Shepard, 1873), Item 198. Rather, Tillman's contribution was that he culturally appropriated the song into the repertoire of white southerners, whose music was derived from gospel, a style that was a distinct influence on Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley. As published by Tillman, the song contains verses not found in Pike's 1873 version. These possibly had accumulated in oral tradition or/and were augmented by lyrics crafted by Tillman. More critically, perhaps, Tillman's published version of the tune has a more-mnemonic cadence which may have helped it gain wider currency. Tillman's emendations have characterized the song ever since, in the culture of all southerners irrespective of race.See the \\"Old Time Religion\\" article. The SATB arrangement in Tillman's songbooks became known to Alvin York and is thus the background song for the 1941 Academy Award film Sergeant York, which spread \\"The Old-Time Religion\\" to audiences far beyond the South.William Shiver, \\"Stories behind the Hymns: Old Time Religion\\" in Lincoln Tribune (Lincolnton, North Carolina), 2008 August 17. Following Tillman's nuanced example, editors with a largely white target market such as Elmer Leon JorgensonIn Jorgenson's Great Songs of the Church, Number Two Edition (Louisville: Word and Work, 1937), the song is Item 275. Jorgenson also, like Tillman, put both gospel songs and stately hymns into the same book. Tillman augmented his Revival hymnal in successive editions, its more-formal or high- church items lending broader credibility to the inclusion of the selections which formed so much of the basis for southern gospel. formalized the first line as \\"'Tis the old-time religion\\" (likewise the repeated first line of the refrain) to accommodate the song more to the tastes of white southern church congregations and their singing culture.For the various phrases which have been employed for the first line, see the \\"Old-Time Religion\\" article. \\"Life‚Äôs Railway to Heaven\\" In 1890, Tillman set to music a hymn by Baptist preacher M.E. Abbey, \\"Life's Railway to Heaven.\\" (Abbey had drawn from an earlier poem, \\"The Faithful Engineer,\\" by William Shakespeare Hays.) Also known by its first line \\"Life is like a mountain railroad\\", the song has been recorded by Boxcar Willie, the Carter Family, the Chuck Wagon Gang, , The Oak Ridge Boys, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Brad Paisley, Russ Taff, the Amazing Rhythm Aces, and many others. Tillman‚Äôs tune is in 3/4 time, but a 4/4 version became also widespread after Patsy Cline recorded it that way in 1959 as a solo; Willie Nelson later dubbed his voice into that version to form a duet.See also \\"Reader Offers Willie Fitting Lyrics\\" and cf. \\"Reader Offers Willie Better-Fitting Lyrics\\" in the Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas) for 2006 October 16 and 2007 February 13 respectively. A Welsh improvisation on \\"Life's Railway to Heaven\\" preserves the Snow-Abbey-Tillman lyrics but matches them to the \\"Welsh National Anthem\\"; see CALON L√ÇN. On January 14, 2012, Brad Paisley performed a 4/4 rendition as guest on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion. And the following week, on 2012-01-21, Keillor himself reprised with a parody beginning \\"Life Is like a Winter Highway\\" caricaturing cold weather in Minnesota. Members of the Western Writers of America chose the song as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Other songs Besides \\"The Old Time Religion\\" and \\"Life‚Äôs Railway to Heaven\\" the Cyber Hymnal lists other Tillman works, including \\"My Mother's Bible\\" as well as \\"Ready\\" and \\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\" (\\"The sands have been washed\\"). The Cyberhymnal lists also the following: :\\"Old Time Power\\" (first line \\"They Were in an Upper Chamber\\") :\\"Save One Soul for Jesus\\" :\\"The Spirit Is Calling\\" :\\"Unanswered Yet\\"Cyber Hymnal biographical sketch on Tillman, accessed 2009 January 19. =\\"My Mother's Bible\\"= \\"My Mother's Bible\\"Words by M.B. Williams, music by Charles Davis Tillman, copyright 1893 by Tillman. is among the 'Mother Songs' of the tear-jerker variety as selected by Mudcat Cafe. Notwithstanding the sentimentality, \\"My Mother's Bible\\" emerged in a number of generally stately hymnals, including the Broadman Hymnal edited by Baylus Benjamin McKinney(Nashville: Broadman Press, 1940), Item 380. and Christian Hymns.(Nashville: Gospel Advocate, 1935), Item 348. =\\"Ready\\"= \\"Ready to suffer grief or pain\\" had a British author in the tradition of the Keswick Hymn-Book, but Tillman wrote the tune which is invariably and exclusively used in the United States. Tillman first published the British lyrics with his tune in Tillman's Revival No. 4 in Atlanta in 1903. The British lyrics are in five quatrains. Tillman moved the original first quatrain into the refrain of his version and altered the words to wed better to the repeated nature of a refrain. He printed the song with a reference to 2 Samuel 15:15 (\\"Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint\\"). In conveying this background, William Jensen ReynoldsCompanion, p. 183; Hymns of Our Faith, pp. 162-163. observes that the Southern Baptist Hymnal Committee decided to name the tune TILLMAN. Reynolds disputed the author's identity as A. C. Palmer, but other researchers have accepted the author's identity as Asa C. Palmer (1845‚Äì1882).See, e.g., John P. Wiegand, ed., Praise for the Lord, Expanded Edition (Nashville: Praise Press, 1997), index of \\"Authors, Composers, Sources\\" (). =\\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\"= Forrest Mason McCann describes \\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\" as \\"A popular song with older folk\\"Hymns & History: An Annotated Survey of Sources (Abilene, TX: ACU Press, 1997), p. 592, . On 2004 February 24 Richard Oldham, of the Glendale Baptist Church in Bowling Green, Kentucky, preached a sermon titled \\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\" at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He concluded by quoting Tillman's eponymous song (written in 1895), which \\"we used to sing\\" but \\"don't hear . . . much anymore\\"; the text for the sermon was 1 Corinthians 15:51-58. (like some hymnals which carry it, McCann indicates the song by its first line, \\"The sands have been washed\\"). The ability of Tillman's work to appeal outside the time and context of southern gospel is evident in the inclusion of \\"The Sands Have Been Washed\\" in the British Favourite Hymns of the Church(Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England: Eye-Opener Publications, 1995), , Item 511, where the tune name is indicated as THE END OF THE WAY; in the \\"Preface\\" (pp. iii-viii) editors Albert E. Winstanley & Graham A. Fisher emphasize that requests from churches which had previously used Elmer Leon Jorgenson's Great Songs of the ChurchNumber Two Edition (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1937O), Item 570. (where the song appears) were a major consideration in which works to include. Jorgenson's hymnal, which offered traditional hymns and gospel songs, had spread \\"The Sands Have Been Washed\\" internationally throughout the Restoration Movement with which Jorgenson's hymnal was associated. \\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\" (\\"The sands have been washed\\") has also been popularized internationally by George Beverly Shea, Bill Gaither, and Lynda Randle.Go to for Randle's rendition. =\\"I Am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger\\"= Additionally, Tillman was responsible for publicizing the lyrics of \\"I Am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger\\" from Bever's Christian Songster (1858)See also Ananias Davisson's Kentucky Harmony which had already established the background of the song in shape note display. together with two additional stanzas from Taylor's Revival Hymns & Plantation Melodies (1882) and popularizing the combination with the minor key tune of various African American and Appalachian nuance. The combination is so hauntingly striking and memorable that the tune itself has been widely recognized as POOR WAYFARING STRANGER or just WAYFARING STRANGER ever since Tillman spread it beyond the Sacred Harp tradition in his Revival songbook of 1891.John P. Wiegand, ed., Praise for the Lord, Expanded Edition (Nashville: Praise Press, 1997), , Item 252.

See the article on Ives. Joan Baez, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Johnny Cash, Dusty Springfield, Emmylou Harris, Bill Monroe, Jack White, Annah Graefe, Selah, and Peter, Paul and Mary, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.The song is listed as well as by the Negro Spirituals web site. Recognized significance Tillman was so recognized in his own time that, at the 1893 World Convention of Christian Workers in Boston, he served as songleader in place of Dwight L. Moody's associate Ira D. Sankey. Tillman's Assembly Book (1927) was selected by both Georgia and South Carolina for the musical scores used in public school programs. Tillman broke into radio early and performed regularly on Atlanta's radio station WSB 750 AM. Once in 1930 the NBC radio network put him on the air for an hour featuring his singing while his daughter accompanied on the piano. He also recorded on Columbia Records.Wayne W.

Its headwaters are in the Monte Cristo Range in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The river flows from this part of the Cascade Range into Drano Lake, an arm of the Bonneville Pool of the Columbia. The river drains a basin of The basin's population was an estimated 513 in 2000. Whitewater kayaking experts sometimes run a stretch of rapids in a steep canyon between the Cook-Underwood Road bridge and Drano Lake. The run, dangerous throughout, is rated Class V (extremely difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Named rapids include Gettin' Busy, Boulder Sluice, Island, Sacriledge, Double Drop, Backender, S-Turn, Wishbone, Bowey's Hotel, The Gorge, Stovepipe, Spirit Falls, Chaos and Master Blaster. The river has been the scene of two kayaking deaths since this stretch was first run in the 1990s. Course The Little White Salmon River begins in the Monte Cristo Range in western Klickitat County near its border with Skamania County. In its upper reaches, it flows generally south through the Gifford Pinchot National Forest before turning southwest, receiving Beetle Creek from the right and entering Skamania County. Downstream of the county border, it passes through Oklahoma Campground and under Oklahoma Road (Forest Road 18), which then runs along the right. In the next stretch, the river receives Homes Creek from the left and Lusk Creek from the right. Turning more sharply south, the river receives Berry Creek from the right, then passes under Oklahoma Road again before Cabbage Creek enters from the right. The road now runs along the left bank of the river as it meanders along the base of Shingle Mountain, which is to the river's right. In this stretch, Wilson Creek enters from the left before the river reaches Big Cedars County Park. Below the park, the river passes under Oklahoma Road again before flowing by Moss Creek Campground, on the river's right along the road. Below camp, Moss Creek enters from the right. Over the next stretch, the river reaches the community of Willard and leaves the national forest. Just below Willard, the river passes under Willard Road, and Pine Creek enters from the right. Slightly further downstream, the Little White Salmon passes the Willard National Fish Hatchery, on the right, flows under Cook-Underwood Road, enters the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and receives Lapham Creek from the left. In a narrow canyon paralleled by Cook-Underwood Road on both sides of the river for the next stretch, the stream receives Rock, Squaw, and Bunker creeks, all from the right. At the end of the canyon, the river passes through the Little White Salmon National Fish Hatchery and enters Drano Lake, from the Columbia's mouth on the Pacific Ocean. Campgrounds The United States Forest Service operates the Oklahoma Campground along upper Little White Salmon River. Amenities include 22 campsites, vault toilets, and potable water. The Lower Monte Carlo Trailhead is across Oklahoma Road (Forest Road 18) from the campground. Further downstream, Skamania County manages the Big Cedars Campground, with two sites for tents and another for a small motorized camper. Near the county park and on the opposite side of Oklahoma Road is Moss Creek Campground, run by the Forest Service. Amenities include potable water, vault toilets, and 17 campsites.

Upgrades, POWER/VS and POWER/VSE were available for and the IBM System/370 running DOS/VS and DOS/VSE respectively. POWER is an acronym for Priority Output Writers, Execution processors and input Readers.  The product  POWER was an operating system enhancement available for DOS/360, DOS/VS, and DOS/VSE, and came packaged with some third party DOS-based operating systems. International Business Machines released POWER in 1969 following a public introduction at the IBM Wall Street Data Center. It 'spooled' (queued) printer and card data, freeing programs from being dependent upon the speed of printers or punched card equipment. POWER competed with non-IBM products, namely DataCorp's The Spooler and SDI's GRASP. Unlike the other products, POWER required a dedicated partition. It allowed a single printer (1403/2311), punch (2520, 2540) or reader (2540, 2501) to be shared by two or more processing partitions. Input data was asynchronously loaded and directed to the proper partition by Job class. Output was directed to disk and stored there - then directed to a printer or punch by the writer type, (PRT, PUN), Job Class, Priority and form code. This was provided in PRT and PUN control cards in the input stream. Once the operator put the proper form in the printer/punch and told power to start (G PUN or G PRT on the console) the device would continue until no more output of that type was available. When a new form was encountered it would alert the operator to change forms and wait for the next go command. Platforms The product ran on IBM systems from the S/360 Model 30 through larger machines. Generally the smaller machines that had less than 128K or Core memory (would be called RAM today but were actually magnetic cores strung on wire matrices) did not have the ability to run POWER.

Oleksy Colloquium Reflects on the Legacy of the KGB by Dr. Michael SzporerWe must not cave in to the spookocracy in the Kremlin, by Martin Ivens, Sunday Times, January 20, 2008 The term has been applied by historians and political commentators to the former Soviet Union, the former German Democratic Republic, Cuba after the 1959 revolution, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin, especially since 2012. Debate also exists whether the United States of America, following the global surveillance disclosures may also fall into the category. According to one definition, \\"The counterintelligence state is characterized by the presence of a large, elite force acting as a watchdog of a security defined as broadly that the state must maintain an enormous vigilance and enforcement apparatus... This apparatus is not accountable to the public and enjoys immense police powers... Whether the civilian government is able to control the security bodies is an open question; indeed the civilian government is so penetrated by the apparatus that there is no clear distinction between the two.\\" In some cases spookocracies feature literal rule of the state by people from secret police, as it was, for instance, in the USSR under Beria and Andropov, and is in Russia under Vladimir Putin. Soviet Union There was a massive security apparatus in the Soviet Union to prevent any opposition, and \\"every facet of daily life fell into the KGB's domain.\\" Undercover staff of the KGB included three major categories: :(a) the active reserve, :(b) the \\"trusted contacts\\" (or \\"reliable people\\"), and :(c) \\"civilian informers\\" (or \\"secret helpers\\"). The \\"active reserve\\" included KGB officers with a military rank who worked undercover. \\"Trusted contacts\\" were high placed civilians who collaborated with the KGB without signing any official working agreements, such as directors of personnel departments at various institutions, academics, deans, or writers and actors.Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia‚ÄîPast, Present, and Future. 1994. , pages 56‚Äì57 Informers were citizens secretly recruited by the KGB, sometimes using forceful recruitment methods, such as blackmail.

She said: \\"If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in business, political parties, NGOs, regional governments, even culture...

Historian Yuri Felshtinsky compared the takeover of Russian state by siloviks with an imaginary scenario of Gestapo coming to power in Germany after World War II. He noted a fundamental difference between the secret police and ordinary political parties, even totalitarian ones, such as the Soviet Communist Party. The Russian secret police organizations use various violent active measures. Hence, according to Felstinsky, they killed Alexander Litvinenko and directed Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives.Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror Historian Yuri Felshtinsky explains his views on the nature of Putinism on C-SPAN Former KGB officer Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy shares similar ideas. When asked \\"How many people in Russia work in FSB?\\", he replied: \\"Whole country. FSB owns everything, including Russian Army and even own Church, the Russian Orthodox Church...

Moreover, available analysis suggests that these three types initially appeared at very different times and, further, even a cursory assessment indicates that the property types are characterized by a divergence of style and content.\\" Map: various Mississippian cultures, including the Upper Mississippian culture area of the Oneota, that reached into Minnesota.

It is named after Lieutenant Colonel Basilio Fernando, who had died during an airplane training accident in the US.(one of the pioneers of the Philippine aviation) It is also the location of PAF Air Education and Training Command of Philippine Air Force. Throughout the years, it has been consistently awarded as the Philippine Air Force‚Äôs Model Base of the Year for its well maintained appearance, excellent base services, aggressive ecological and environmental control, and consistent safety and security control. Location It is located in Lipa, Batangas, about 83 km SSE of Manila, Philippines. It is above sea level and is situated on a plateau overlooking Taal Volcano with an area of of land which keep its climate temperature cool all day. History The base was built by the U. S. Army prior to the Pacific War. On December 22, 1941 the 27th Bombardment Group temporarily transferred its personnel to Lipa before departing on December 25 to Cabcaben Airfield. During early 1942, it was occupied by elements of the Japanese Imperial Army 16th Division commanded by General Morioka. During the Japanese occupation, Lipa Airfield was repaired and expanded by the Japanese. On 12 April 1948, the late President Manuel Roxas directed the renaming of Lipa Air Base to Fernando Field and subsequently, to Fernando Air Base in honor of Lt. Col. Basilio Fernando, one of the pioneers of Philippine aviation. In 1952, Fernando Air Base became a training base called the 100th Training Wing where training units and other support units of the Philippine Air Force were grouped. The base was used to train Philippine airmen. There were 3 different learning/training facilities on the base: The Air Force Flying School, the Technical Training Center, and the NCO Academy, which conducted continuing education for NCO's. These facilities were staffed with instructors from the 100th Training Wing until 22 September 1999, when the functions were subsumed by the Air Education and Training Command.

The prefix 'Chondro' is seen combined with other common forenames to form multiple Greek surnames, i.e. Chondrogiorgos, Chondronikolas ... Chondroyannos is a family name of lineage most commonly associated to members of the Greek diaspora from the Dodecanese region of Greece. Prior to taking root in the Dodecanese, family members resided in Asia Minor (present day, western coastal Turkey) for what is believed to have been centuries before a massive population exchange between Greece and Turkey; which took place in the early 20th century. In accordance with the stipulations of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Chondroyannos family along with an estimated 1.500.000 million Greeks were forcibly placed within the area of Greece's then newly defined boundary. Later in the same century, only a small number from the clan established themselves in communities outside Greece (Canada and the United States of America are known). The surname was transliterated during the family's migration from Greece to produce the Latin phonetic spelling. The original Greek name is known to be shared by Hellenes in other regions of Greek society. When translating, today's Hellenes of Greece and the European Community who hold the surname Chondroyannos more commonly spell the name using a shallow orthographic method, relating each Greek letter to a corresponding letter in the Latin alphabet. This literal translation of the surname Chondroyannos thus becomes, Hondrogiannos or Hondrogiannis.  Origins and tradition  The Chondroyannos surname is believed to have been incorporated during the period of Ottoman rule in Greece (14th to 19th centuries). As is often dictated by Greek custom, the forenames of family members are passed on from preceding generations. Additionally, traditional Greek Orthodox/Christian forenames are common within the Chondroyannos lineage.

They were ordered to search for an heirloom of the kingdom, which had been stolen by Ratu Pantai Selatan (The Queen of the Southern Ocean). As the king of Blambangan knew that some of the Mataram people were staying within his kingdom. He ordered them to leave Nusa Barong Island. Feeling defeated, the remaining warriors ran away to the valley of Semeru mountain (which us now known as Tumpeng village). In the village they met an elder called ‚ÄòMbah Tuan‚Äô. He suggested that they make a ‚ÄúKauripan‚Äù (life), for themselves on the east of the Tumpeng village. Then the Mataram people chose to live in Watu Dakon (which is now Dusun Krajan 1). They could make a life for themselves there. In 1924, under Dutch colonialism, the first Kepala Desa Gesang was chosen, Bapak Taman Wirorejo.

In May 2018, the United States relocated its Tel Aviv embassy to Jerusalem. In mid-October 2018, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the Consulate General would be merged with the new US Embassy in Jerusalem and that relations with the Palestinians would be conducted through a special Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the Embassy. On March 4, 2019, the Consulate General formally ceased operations and was merged into the US Embassy. History The U.S. consulate first opened in 1844 in the Old City, inside Jaffa Gate, in what is now the Swedish Christian Study Center. In the late 19th century, the consulate moved to a site on the Street of the Prophets. In 1912, it moved to Gershon Agron Street, in present-day West Jerusalem. The main building, one of the first houses built outside the Old City walls, was constructed in 1868 by Ferdinand Vester, a German Lutheran missionary. A third story was added later. On May 23, 1948, the Consul General, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated. In 1952, the consulate leased another building on Nablus Road, East Jerusalem.\\"About the Consulate .\\" Consulate-General of the United States in Jerusalem. Retrieved on January 16, 2009. =Trump Administration and merger into US Embassy= On May 14, 2018, the new embassy of the United States in Jerusalem opened on a small part of the Arnona site of the Jerusalem consulate general, and it is now the new diplomatic mission from the United States of America to the State of Israel, replacing the former embassy of the United States in Tel Aviv. Out of the 1,000 employees at the Tel Aviv embassy, about 50 transferred to operate the new embassy. The Consulate General will continue to operate as an independent mission from its historic Agron Road site. The opening of the new Embassy coincide with the bloodiest day of the 2018 Gaza border protests, seeing the death of more than 40 Palestinians demonstrators. The opening also coincides with the 70th Anniversary of Israel as a Nation in this modern era. On October 18, 2018, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US would be merging the US Consulate General with the newly-relocated US Embassy in Jerusalem into a single mission. Pompeo also announced that the US would continue to conduct its reporting, outreach and program in the Palestinian Territories through a new Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the US Embassy in Jerusalem. This unit will operate from the Agron Road site in Jerusalem. While the announcement was welcomed by the Israeli Government, Palestinian officials accused the Trump Administration for supporting Israel's claim to Jerusalem. On February 19, 2019, it was reported that US Consulate General would be merging into the US Embassy in March 2019. On March 4, 2019, the Consulate General ceased operating and was merged into the US Embassy; ending the US practice of having separate diplomatic missions to the Israelis and Palestinians. The former Consulate-General's Agron Road building will be renamed the Palestinian Affairs Unit, which will carry out many of the former Consulate-General's functions. The last Consul-General was Karen Sasahara. In response to the Consulate General's merger into the US Embassy, Saeb Erekat, the secretary-general of the PLO's Executive Committee urged the international community to boycott the new Palestinian Affairs Unit. Meanwhile, fellow Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi called the closure of the Consulate General \\"an assault on Palestinian rights and identity.\\"  Location  The US Consulate General was located on 18 Gershon Agron Street and once operated a consular section on 14 David Flusser Street, Arnona in West Jerusalem. Until 2010, citizen and visa services operated out of the building at 27 Nablus Road in East Jerusalem. In October 2010, consular services were moved to a new building complex (just east of the Arnona neighborhood of West Jerusalem) bisected by the Green Line and thus partly in what was defined in 1949 as No Man's Land.American consulate relocates to high-end area On May 14, 2018, the new US Embassy in Jerusalem moved into the Arnona consular section annex compound of the current Jerusalem consulate general which continues to exist. The space will house the Ambassador and a small staff. The Ambassador will split his time between the two locations. The remaining Embassy functions will be conducted out of the former Tel Aviv Embassy now officially referred to a Branch Office of the Embassy. Most consular Functions of the still existing Consulate have been subsumed under Embassy authority. The embassy compound is located on a parcel of land that straddles the unsettled boundary green line into a No Man‚Äôs Land so designated at the armistice agreement between Jordan and Israel ending the 1948 Arab- Israeli war.

The story, a dramatic slice-of-life, follows the life of Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love-interest of two girls during his second term, and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters. Though the game requires little interaction from users, Cross Days engages the player through a nonlinear plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play. The game is the third installation of the School Days line of series, succeeding Summer Days. 0verflow announced work on Cross Days in December 2008. From February 2009 to March 2010, the game was postponed a total of six times, going on to perform marginally-well upon release. In the weeks following this, after it was illegally found on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, a trojan horse disguised as the game was released, publishing the personal information of unknowing users online for public access. Following the game's release, Cross Days made transitions into other media: a manga was serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Monthly Comp Ace from April 26 to August 10, 2010; three light novels were published from September 15 to October 29, as was a strategy guide; a radio drama was broadcast during development; and the game's original soundtrack was also published by Lantis from April 24 to July 21. Gameplay Cross Days is a visual novel. These are essentially played by watching and listening to episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing the direction of the story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse. Like the games before it, Cross Days is presented with limited animation. The game is audibly stereophonic with lip- synched voice acting, sound effects and background music. Plot Yuuki Ashikaga is a high school freshman in his second semester at the fictional Sakakino Academy, who from his regular visits to the library, grows enamored by Kotonoha Katsura, a classmate who also comes to read. Despite being in a relationship, she genuinely reciprocates his interest. However, things become complicated when his sister, Chie, introduces him to Roka Kitsuregawa, a friend of hers. In an attempt to make herself seem harder to get, Roka claims that she is equally interested in Makoto Itou, another schoolmate. Her lie is unsuccessful, as Yuuki, aware that Makoto is Kotonoha's boyfriend, decides to ask her about the affair. =Setting= Unlike in Summer Days, the story in Cross Days is not rewritten as a spin-off of the original story, but occurs during the events of it, making the game a parallel series to School Days. As such, the undisclosed location of the story remains the same with focus being around the school. All signature characters and their established relationships appear in the game, with six new cast members. Characters Example of a conversation in Cross Days. Here, Roka is talking to Yuuki. Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose withdrawn school life goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships with his friends and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute the premise of the game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose efforts to make Yuuki jealous only serve to further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from Summer Days. Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game. Development News of Cross Days first surfaced in the December 2008 issue of Tech Gian, a magazine published by Enterbrain, on October 21, showing first ever screenshots, reporting on the story and characters, and mentioning that Cross Days would contain 3D animation with a meticulously reworked plot and male protagonist. Also in October, ASCII Media Works and Gakken published articles about the game in their respective issues of Dengeki G's Magazine, Dengeki Hime and Megami Magazine. Promotion began shortly after. Besides periodically keeping the public informed on development and characters, 0verflow consecutively released downloadable, non-playable benchmarks of the game from November 1, 2008, to May 4, 2009. Company staff attended Dream Party, an anime convention, in Osaka on November 16, 2008, selling Cross Days telephone cards while stores took pre-orders for the game, reportedly filling reservations in days. On December 5, 0verflow announced that a set of USB teledildonics, collectively known as SOM, would be compatible with Cross Days, manufactured by Goods Land. Trial versions of the game, released to about 95 select retailers, were disclosed by 0verflow on December 26 and at Comiket 75. On January 8, 2009, 0verflow announced that starting that day, Lantis would be airing a weekly, episodic internet radio drama of the game's characters, titled Radio Cross Days. Broadcasts were made regularly on Thursdays, finishing up on March 25, 2010 with 64 sessions aired. Cross Days was originally scheduled to come out on February 27, 2009, but its release was postponed six times: to April 24, June 26, November 20, December 18, January 29, 2010, and to March 19, 2010, when it finally came out. The much-anticipated game was released to several promotional campaigns, many of which were intercity screening venues that spanned operation from March 5 to 14. =Release history= On March 29, 2010 0verflow announced that an outdated DLL had been released with retail versions of the game. A 372 KB replacement was provided via download. The following day another patch was released to bring copies of the game up to version 1.00a. Cross Days was ported to two other platforms. AiCherry, an interactive movie developer, re- released Cross Days as a DVD game on April 28, 2011, as did PalaceGame, a UMD publisher, for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on July 29, 2011. =Trojan scare= On April 15, 2010, roughly a month after Cross Days was released, BBC News reported on the spread of a virus named Kenzero masquerading on peer-to- peer (P2P) networks as unlicensed copies of erotic games; one of which, according to software developer SPAMFighter, included Cross Days. Users tricked into installing the virus, termed a form of \\"ransomware\\" in the report, were asked for personal information and then had all of their web history posted to a blog, operated by shell corporation Romancing Inc., for public access. NetAgent, a property rights company, reported that at least 5,510 people were collectively infected. Those wishing to have their information removed could do so after acknowledging to viewers that they had attempted to download the game illegally. SPAMfighter has noted that the intrusive nature of the trojan was \\"in fact explained in [the software's] terms of service\\". Sales Cross Days for Windows premiered as the third most sold game on Getchu.com, a major redistributor of visual novel and domestic anime products, during the month of its release, ranking twelfth for the first half of 2010, and thirty-first for the whole year. The DVD game ranked as the most sold DVDi for the first half of 2011, and forty-seventh most from November 26 to December 27. Cross Days for the PSP additionally ranked as the fifteenth most sold UMD game during that time as well. Media =Manga= Based on the story of the game, Cross Days was published into a manga, written by Yoko Kagura and illustrated by Homare Sakazuki. 0verflow announced on April 4, 2010 that it would make its serialization debut in Monthly Comp Ace on April 26. The series was circulated until August 2010, published by Kadokawa Shoten into a first and second volume, released November 26, 2010 and June 25, 2011, respectively. =Books and publications= In addition to the manga, Cross Days was made into other print. The first of these was a strategy guide and artwork book by Junji Goto, character artist for 0verflow, titled and published by Kinema Junpousha in August 2010. The subsequent three releases were light novels by different authors but whose cover art was drawn by Goto and illustrated by Jet Yowatari; each book retold the story of the game. Cross Days, a novel, was published by Harvest Books on September 15, written by Mutsuki Mizusaki. Another novel, titled , was released on October 22, 2010 by Shueisha, authored by Hiro Akizuki. The final novel, was written by Yoko Kagura, author of the manga adaption, and was published on October 29 by Kill Time Communication. =Audio CDs= Cross Days Original Soundtrack As was the case for School Days and Summer Days, the original soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009. As this was the first of the later six postponements, however, the album was republished and deferred to June 26. Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's background music, all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks. Radio Cross Days, a radio drama broadcast from January 8, 2009, to March 25, 2010, was the second and final set of audio compilations made for the game by Lantis. Released as a first and second disc on June 23 and July 21, 2010, respectively, each album contained thirty-two segments of the broadcast, comprising the sixty-four total that were aired. =Merchandise= Considerable effort was made to market and promote Cross Days before and after its release, including the sale of brand merchandise. The limited edition of the visual novel came with a figurine of the Kotonoha character, and 0verflow and its partners also sold wall scrolls and Zippo lighters, as well as shower curtains, cushion mousepads, dakimakura cases.

Essentially self-taught as an artist, he is best known for his poetic paintings of New York City, often in snow. Background Johann Henrik Carl Berthelsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the seventh of seven sons born to Conrad and Dorothea Karen Berthelsen. His father was a tenor with the Royal Opera and his mother was a nurse. Following the divorce of the parents, in 1890 his mother brought the children to America, joining her sister in Manistee, Michigan. Soon they settled in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Johann developed an early interest in singing, acting, drawing, and painting. He dropped out of school after the fifth grade and worked in various jobs. He moved to Chicago at age eighteen, planning to pursue a career in theater. An old friend who was studying voice at the Chicago Musical College encouraged him to pursue singing. Upon auditioning at the school, Berthelsen was offered a full scholarship. While a student there he won two gold medals. Career Following his graduation in 1905, he toured the United States and Canada, performing in operas, Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, and concerts until 1910, when he began teaching voice at the Chicago Musical College. In his spare time he pursued painting, with encouragement and some instruction from the Norwegian-American Impressionist painter Svend Svendsen. In 1913, Berthelsen moved to Indianapolis to become the head of the voice department at Indianapolis Conservatory of Music. He formed a lifelong friendship with painter Wayman Adams, who was the same age and had studied with William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri. Adams would paint many portraits of Berthelsen, including a life-sized image of his friend about to go on stage for a concert. Adams is credited by some as having provided painting instruction to Berthelsen, and they may have had a double wedding in 1918. In 1920, Adams (who was married to a fellow artist) and Berthelsen decided to move to New York City to further their careers. Berthelsen opened a private school of voice in the Rodin Studios building. According to the Berthelsen Conservancy, one of his pupils was a singer, dancer and entertainer named Helenya Kaschewski, whom he married on March 15, 1928. They had three children‚Äîa daughter, Karen, and two sons, John and Lee. He continued to pursue art, and in 1925 he was elected to the American Watercolor Society. He also mastered the pastel medium during the 1920s. With the Great Depression Berthelsen lost his voice students, and the family had to sell many of their possessions and move to an ever-smaller series of apartments. A fellow artist suggested painting in oils, which he began to do, and he had gradually increasing success in selling his canvases. In the mid-1930s he was also involved in several New Deal art projects. He joined the Salmagundi Club in 1935 and remained a member until his death. In 1942 the family moved to rural New Milford, Connecticut, where Berthelsen painted many views of the surroundings. But his most popular canvases represented New York City scenes. They were collected by prominent figures including William Randolph Hearst, Richard E. Berlin, Frank Sinatra, Ethel Merman, and Dinah Shore. In 1950 the family moved back to New York City, in part because of the high demand for his work and easy access to galleries. He exhibited his work at the Barbizon-Plaza Galleries, the Allan Rich Gallery, and the Jean Bohne Gallery, among others. He continued to paint well into his eighties. In 1971 he was hit by a car, which led to a decline in health and ultimately his death the following year.

Caldor had bought up the location and was in the processes of opening their store in the fall of 1995 but those plans were stalled when the chain filed for bankruptcy that year.

It was produced by Lobby Loyde; whereas the band's first album was reputedly recorded in five hours, the second was completed in five days. Details Between this and its first album X-Aspirations the group had broken up; mainstays Steve Lucas and Ian Rilen had played with Harold Holt and the Sharks and The Feel, and Sardine v respectively. Lucas and Rilen and Steve Cafiero regrouped as X in late 1984. X was managed by Sydney-based manager Nick Chance of Chance Management between 1984 and 1986 after he was approached by Ian Rilen to do so, and agreed. Steve Cafiero played his last show with X at the North Sydney Leagues Club on 2 December 1984. X was on a tour and heading to Melbourne, 2 days after the last show it transpired for Cafiero when he broke the news. The Melbourne shows were at The Club 5 Dec; La Trobe Uni. 6 Dec; Prince of Wales Hotel 7 Dec; and Eureka Hotel 8 Dec. Cathy was recommended by booking agent Gerard Schlaghecke at Premier Artists in Melbourne, after a call from Nick on 3 Dec advising Cafiero had left the band, and asking Gerard if he knew a Melbourne-based replacement. He recommended Cathy, knowing her to be fan of X and that she knew the songs. Cathy agreed to do the shows on 2 days notice and a rehearsal studio was booked for the evening of 4 Dec in Melbourne on arrival of Ian, Steve and Nick. Ian's bass was so loud at that first rehearsal, Nick recalls sitting in the rental car below and hearing nothing but the bass with the reverberations felt in the car. X were rehearsing in a three-story double brick building on the third floor. During the 2nd rehearsal Nick organised by requesting an extended soundcheck at The Club 5 Dec, Cathy began playing the drum pattern for 'You Say That You Love Me'. Ian joined in with a bass line tune, and Steve added guitar. The song was written in about 10 mins. It was to go on the At Home With You album when it was recorded in March 1985. During that moment Steve and Ian, with Nick watching, all realised X had found a new drummer that was as good, if not better than Steve Cafiero. Cathy played all the shows flawlessly and impressed everyone with her drumming style and ability. It was one of the things that made At Home With You the album it was. It would have been quite a different album, possibly not as good, if Cathy hadn't joined the band. She breathed new life into the band, and at the time when they needed it, still getting over the shock of Steve Cafieros's sudden departure after so many years as an original lineup member. The song 'You Say That You Love Me' made the album in March 1985 when it was recorded, and it would never have been written at all if Cathy had not agreed to join the band on 2 days notice. Cathy had previously been a member of the Canberra band  (pronounced 'Cough Cough'). Green had first seen X 'a couple of years earlier' at the invitation of Mark Seymour, of Hunters and Collectors; three tracks on At Home With You which utilised the 'Horns of Contempt' (John Howard, Jeremy Smith and Michael Waters), the brass section from Hunters & Collectors. The latter also covered Ian and Stephanie Rilen's song 'Stuck on You', which originally recorded by Sardine V. It was on the 'Hunters & Collectors' 1986 album Human Frailty. The 'X - At Home With You' album was recorded by and on the Major Music label run by Max Robenstone. He also has a relative that ran restaurant that provided excellent food to the studio which was Richmond Recorders, all paid for by Major Records. Reception Ian McFarlane has written that At Home with You 'displayed a breadth and sense of dynamics only previously hinted at in the band's music. A lot had to do with the freshness and vitality, to say nothing of the rhythmic swing, that Green contributed to the band.'Ian McFarlane The Encyclopaedia of Australian Rock and Pop Allen and Unwin, St Leonards 1999 p. 692 Richard Guilliatt, writing in the Age in November 1985, claimed the LP 'vindicates the band's persistence, a fantastic slice of the most basic, earthy rock...'Richard Guilliatt, 'X marks the spot' Melbourne Age 8 November 1985 p. 44 The sleeve notes to the 2009 reissue, quoting an interview with Green from December, 1985, claim that the photograph on the album cover is of the band reacting with hilarity to The Cosby Show.

He is noted for instigating criminal charges against disgraced South African police commissioner Jackie Selebi and ANC president Jacob Zuma. In 2008 he was suspended from his duties by President Thabo Mbeki, a close confidant of Selebi, and then subsequently fired by Mbeki's successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, who is an ally of Zuma. As such, opposition parties and sections of the press have claimed Pikoli is the victim of two separate political conspiracies. In October 2014 Pikoli was appointed as the Western Cape's first police ombudsman by Premier Helen Zille, whose choice was unanimously backed by the provincial legislature's standing committee on community safety.http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/pikoli-is-cape-s-first-police- ombudsman-1.1771006 Education Pikoli attended St John's College in Mthatha, and later obtained undergraduate degrees from the National University of Lesotho and a MA in Law from the University of Zimbabwe in 1988. As a student he was an active member of the ANC's youth movement, and received military training in Angola. Early career Between 1991 and 1994 he worked in the private legal profession, but became Special Advisor to the Minister of Justice in 1994. He served in that capacity until 1997, when he became Deputy Director-General (Human Resources) in the Department of Justice & Constitutional Development. In 1999 he became Director-General in the same department, a position he held for six years. National Director of Public Prosecutions In 2005 he was appointed to head up the National Prosecuting Authority as the National Director of Public Prosecutions. On 24 September 2007 President Thabo Mbeki suspended Pikoli in terms of Section 12(6)(a) of the National Prosecution Act 32 of 1998, citing an \\"irretrievable break down in the working relationship between the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development and the NDPP.\\" Three days later the South African Broadcasting Corporation claimed that a warrant was issued on 10 September by the NPA for the arrest of the head of the South African Police and Interpol, Jackie Selebi ‚Äì a close confidant of Mbeki. According to SABC the warrant was secured by Pikoli, before Pikoli was suspended by the country's President Mbeki. Journalists at the Mail & Guardian subsequently provided supporting evidence to the claim that Mbeki had suspended Pikoli as part of a bid to shield Police Commissioner Selebi. The leader of South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance party, Helen Zille, said that the suspension of Pikoli was a \\"serious development\\" that needed further explanation: \\"The country needs to know why Pikoli has been suspended.\\" Human Sciences Research Council political commentator Adam Habib said: > If the president suspended Mr Pikoli on the grounds that he had issued a > warrant for the commissioner's arrest, then it suggests that an invasion is > being made into an independent institution's operations. Intervening in the > operations of the National Prosecuting Authority constitutes a violation of > our Constitution. After Mbeki's resignation from the presidency, his successor Kgalema Motlanthe fired Pikoli. Opposition leader Helen Zille pointed out that even though Motlanthe is a close supporter of Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma, Motlanthe had his own reasons for distrusting Pikoli. In particular she claimed that Pikoli's efforts to charge Zuma with corruption made him a target for Motlanthe, and that Pikoli had been both suspended and fired for political reasons. Pikoli's dismissal would have to be ratified by Parliament. The proceedings got off to a shaky start when the co-chairperson of the ad hoc parliamentary committee dealing with the matter, Oupa Monareng, was revealed to have been convicted of criminal charges in the mid 1990s. On 11 August 2009 Pikoli was granted an interim interdict by the High Court in Pretoria, which prevents Zuma from appointing a successor to the position. This was until the application could be heard by the same court in November.Zuma says he respects Pikoli judgement M&G; On 21 November 2009 the government reached a R7.5 million out-of-court settlement with Pikoli to stop his legal bid for reinstatement. Subsequent career Pikoli is currently serving as a commissioner of the Khayelitsha Commission, which is investigating the crime and policing situation in Khayelitsha and the Western Cape Police Ombudsman.

She was born in Salem, India, and her father was the Collector of the District, M. D. Cockburn. The family initially visited Kotagiri in summer but settled permanently around 1855 at \\"Hope Park\\". Cockburn experimented on tea planting at Alports Estate and made numerous observations on local natural history and many of these were reported in the works of Allan Octavian Hume. She also made paintings of local birds and flora. The Natural History Museum, London, produced a diary in 2002 with illustrations made by her of the fauna and flora of the Kotagiri region. A collection of butterflies was also bequeathed to the Natural History Museum. She set up the first school for Badagas and contributed towards the construction of a church at Kotagiri in 1867 which was later taken over by the Basel Mission.Francis, W.

Variations of this may be used to monitor drivers and warn them to make the required threshold of speed or be parked (disqualified). Similarly, the IndyCar Series uses a 105% rule and NASCAR has a 115% rule, mainly for performance on track, though INDYCAR and NASCAR often adjust the rule for tracks with very abrasive surfaces (such as Atlanta Motor Speedway) where lap times can be considerably faster when a car has newer tires. ;200 MPH Club: (Also known as the \\"2 Club\\" or \\"Dirty Two Club\\" for records taking place at El Mirage Lake) A lifetime \\"membership\\" awarded by the SCTA or another sanctioning body / circuit to any driver who drives over a specified distance at a minimum speed of , while also breaking a record.url=http://www.bonneville200mph.org/bylaws.html Membership can stretch over from the more exclusive 300 to the elite 400. A Drivers race on the apron at Chicagoland Speedway (the area between the white and yellow lines) ;Aero cover: see wheel shroud ;Air jacks: Compressed air activated lifting cylinders strategically mounted to the frame of and near the wheels of a racing car which project downwards to lift the car off the ground during a pit stop so to more quickly change wheels/tires or provide mechanics access to the underside of the car for repairs. ;Alphabet soup: In Midget and Sprint Car racing, and in many short tracks, \\"alphabet soup\\" denotes the various preliminary races drivers will race through to advance to the feature. Such is named for the heat race format from the O Main at the Chili Bowl to the N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, and A Main.

It is sometimes a derogatory term. ;Backup car: See Spare car. ;Bag of doughnuts: (drag racing) When a driver scores a perfect reaction time, 0.000 seconds. ;Beam: (drag racing) starting line electric eye controlling prestaged and staged lights. ;Banking: A.) The angle at which a track inclines towards the outside of a corner or from the lower to the higher side of a straight, also referred to as camber, more so when modest or negative, B.) a corner that inclines towards the outside or C.) an earth bank where spectators sit or stand ;The Big One: A large pileup during a stock car race involving up to 30 cars. The term is largely reserved for restrictor plate racing at Daytona and Talladega. ;Black Flagged: To be ordered to the pits or penalty box, due to a rules infraction or unsafe car (loose parts, smoking, dropping fluid, etc.). A black flag is shown to the car that has to stop. Also known as \\"being posted\\". ;Blend line: The painted line defining the exit from pit lane where it rejoins the race track. It prevents emerging race cars from driving into race traffic travelling past the pits. Competitors are penalised for crossing the blend line, ensuring cars have attained full racing speed before rejoining the race. ;Bleach box: (drag racing) Area where bleach is deposited for cars to perform burnouts (q.v). Gasoline (since discontinued for safety reasons), water, and TrackBite are also used. Most organisations only permit water. This is done at the start of most drag races. ;Blow: See Blown. ;Blower: supercharger (occasionally turbocharger); in '90s, generally grouped as \\"power adder\\" with turbocharger and nitrous. ;Blown: A.) An engine that is supercharged (i.e. a \\"blown\\" V8 is a supercharged V8) B.) An engine that has suffered catastrophic failure, is no longer running, or has sustained irreparable damage (i.e. \\"Looks like #21 has a blown engine...his race is over\\"). ;Blowover: flipping of a car or boat, due to excessive air under the chassis or hull, respectively. ;Bottle: (drag racing) refers to the nitrous system, also the jug. ;Bottoming, Bottoming out: When the bottom of the chassis hits the track. ;Box: A mostly-European term used to by people on the pit wall to tell a driver to come into the pitlane for a pitstop. \\"Box this lap!\\" ;Breakout: (drag racing) running quicker than dial- in; also \\"breaking out.\\" Grounds for disqualification if opponent does not commit a foul start or cross boundary lines; also known as Bustout. ;Bump and run: A move with origins in stock car racing, where a trailing car intentionally bumps the car in front in an attempt to pass. ;Burnout: Performed to heat the tires up for better traction. It is also used in stock car racing typically to celebrate a race win. ;Buschwhacker, Claim Jumper (2008‚Äì14), or Signal Pirate (2015‚Äì): (NASCAR) A driver who regularly races in the first tier NASCAR series, the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, who makes guest or semi-regular appearances racing in the second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series. The term was named originally for then sponsor of the second-tier series Anheuser-Busch brewery. Claim Jumper was a reference to second-tier sponsor Nationwide Insurance (2008‚Äì14), and Signal Pirate references current second-tier sponsor Comcast Xfinity. ;Bye: Allows a driver to advance to the next stage or heat of an event, without competing, when there are uneven numbers entered. Commonly used in speedway, drag racing and drifting etc. C dirt track ;Cackle Fest: A.) (Drag Racing) Referring to when 2 Top Fuel or Funny Car cars are sitting at the starting line and one or both cars refuse to stage. The motor noise at idle sounds like a cackle. At the discretion of the starter, they can order the drivers to stage or even have them pull out of the lanes and have the next race group come forward. Or B.) A show and shine for hot rods where the cars are allowed to idle. ;Camber: A.) The angle at which wheels are set up to tilt in or out, measured in degrees in or out from 90 degrees (i.e. \\"2.5 degrees negative camber\\" means each wheel is tilted 2.5 degrees inwards from vertical) \\"Positive camber\\" means the top of the tyre is angled outwards from the car; \\"negative camber\\" means that the top tilts inwards. Negative camber assists cornering performance as the outside tyres lean into the corner (like a motorcycle) which keeps the lateral forces on the tire lower and causes less flex in the sidewall, although it does also have the effect of increasing tyre wear. Or B.) Banking, the angle at which a corner inclines towards the outside or a straight from its lower side to its higher side. Sometimes specified as positive camber and negative camber, the latter indicating a decline from the inside of a corner. ;: A series of and combination of chain-link fencing, welded grid fencing, and / or cables used to slow or stop out of control cars and prevent debris and tyres from hitting the crowd. It is common on short tracks, street and permanent circuits. ;: Also known as a recovery tank. A receptacle placed in a go kart to capture the liquids like water and oil that would otherwise drop onto the track.https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/Go_Kart_Catch_Cans_and_Tanks_s/2079.htm ;Caution / Caution period: See Full course yellow. ;Chase vehicle: In off-road racing, a non-competitive vehicle that follows a competing vehicle to assist with repairs. ;Chicane: An artificial feature added to the natural course of a track to slow cars or create a passing zone. SIR ;Chopping Down the Christmas Tree: See Wired to the tree. ;Christmas tree: The series of lights in drag racing that signal the approach and start of a race in addition to showing starting violations. ;Church break: A compulsory time-off period in which all motorsport activities must cease for a short period on late Sunday morning to allow church services to proceed without disruption from adjacent noise, common to all motorsport venues taking place within a certain proximity of a church, or if local regulations mandate such. At Lime Rock Park, racing on Sunday is specifically prohibited. Some series intentionally do not allow any activity on the circuit until after noon on Sunday. Many series in North America reserve such time off in order to have chapel services inside the circuit, organised by a ministry traveling with the series, and spectators with chapel services organised by local churches. ;Clean air: Air that has not been affected by turbulence from other cars. The opposite of dirty air. ;Clerk of the Course: The official responsible for all on-track activities including demonstrations and parades. They oversee the track conditions, supervise the marshals and emergency services, control the deployment of the safety car and decide upon suspending a session. If a race director is appointed the clerk is junior and the race director has ultimate authority; if not they are often the most senior official at a racing event. ;Closing/shutting the door: A driver takes an early defensive racing line into a corner to block the car behind from overtaking along the preferred line. ;Co-driver: In rally racing, a co- driver directs the driver through the course by reading pacenotes which describe the turns and obstacles ahead. Also called a navigator historically when the reading of maps played a larger part in rallies prior to the widespread adoption of pacenoting. The term is also used in long-distance sports car and touring car racing where more than one driver is sharing the same vehicle. ;Competition caution: A preplanned full course yellow, mandated by the sanctioning body, where drivers bring their vehicles into the pits. Frequently done to change tires because of excessive tire wear or to prevent teams from having to hire specialised pit crews (see Controlled Caution). In some cases, the safety car only is applied after a set number of consecutive green-flag laps or time has been run without a safety car (typically 50-100 laps). A cash or points bonus may be paid to the team leading at the time of the period (such as end of stage competition cautions in NASCAR's national series). ;Control: Where the series organisers specify that all competitors in the race must use an identical part; as in control tyre or control engine. ;Controlled Caution: During a Safety Car period, regardless of a Competition Caution or an incident that brings out the Safety Car, teams can change tires and add fuel, within a limited time (2-5 laps or five minutes) to make adjustments. Depending on the series, teams will either not lose any track position (if it is an interval break) or will not lose track position relative to the cars that pitted during the caution (for example, if the third, fourth, and eighth place cars pit during the caution, they will be the first, second, and third place cars coming off pit lane, and will start behind lead-lap cars that did not pit, in the same relative order as before the safety car. This rule intends to prevent teams from hiring pit crews such as those seen in NASCAR's national series, which can cost at least $5,000 and often over $10,000 per race. ;Crate motor: An engine that is ready-built and sealed by an independent company. Crate motors are sometimes mandated and sometimes optional. They are commonly used in regional touring series down to local tracks in divisions from late models on down. Crate motors are implemented to limit costs and it ensures that the entire field has the same equipment. The ARCA Racing Series and NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series have an optional LS-based GM small block engine 396ci crate engine option. ;Crossed sticks: Two curled up flags held out in form of a cross signal the halfway mark in many American racing series. ;Cushion: In dirt or off-road racing, when dirt is kicked up from the track that lands near the wall after trucks drift through the corners. The dirt builds up after time and can slow a driver down if they slide too deep into it while sliding through the turn. ;Customer car: When a racing team uses a car built for them, either by another team, or by a specialist racing chassis manufacturer. Primarily a Formula One term where the majority of teams build their own cars. The practice has since been banned from F1. In some short track Late Model and Modified teams, \\"customer cars\\" are standard, while the opposite is the \\"house car,\\" which is the works cars built by a chassis builder. D Delaware start ;Deep braking: Applying the brakes later than normal when entering a turn. ;Deep staging: (drag racing) when a dragster pulls so far forward that they leave the pre stage area and turn off the pre stage lights on the Christmas Tree, but not far enough to leave the staged area. This is legal in drag racing. This may give the driver a few inch advantage, unless the other driver deep stages too. ;Delaware start: A style of restart where the race leader starts in the first row by themself and the other drivers start two-wide. Named after a start method for a short track in the state of Delaware in the United States. The leader can choose which lane they want for the restart, which can be an advantage, with a clear advantage over second place. Compare that to Lane Choice. Delta Time (also Pit-Stop Delta) : The entire time it generally takes a driver to enter the pit lane, make a full pit stop, and exit the pit area back to the track to resume racing at optimum pace. For example, a Delta Time of 25 seconds means the entire pitting process (entering, stopping and exiting) cost the driver 25 seconds not driving at full race speed even though the car may have been stationary in the pit box for only 5 seconds. Density Altitude (often DA) : (drag racing) which often refers to the quality of air. Technically \\"quality of air\\" refers to the pressure drop as altitude above sea level increases. Atmospheric air pressure is lower at a race track higher above sea level. All non-turbocharged internal combustion engines produce less power as air pressure drops, as each intake stroke draws in less air per volume than normally. This may require the engine to be \\"tuned\\" to optimize the power, as it may still \\"think\\" it's at a lower altitude. Because a supercharged engine pressurizes intake air at a fixed mechanical ratio to the engines RPM's, it suffers a proportionate loss in power, but not as severe as a naturally aspirated engine will. A turbocharged engine is largely unaffected, as the lower density of the intake air is offset by the lower backpressure resisting the exhaust flow through the turbo. ;Dial-in: (drag racing) when bracket racing, drivers must estimate or \\"dial in\\" the time in which they expect to run. Therefore, two unmatched cars in weight and power can compete, by a handicap system. If one runs a faster time than dialed in, it is a breakout. Did Not Attend (often DNA) : Denotes a driver who was entered for a race but did not attend the circuit. Sometimes referred to as Did Not Arrive or simply a \\"no show.\\" Did Not Finish (often DNF) : A driver who did not finish the race. Some sanctioning bodies do not classify a driver in the final results if they did not finish completed a certain number of laps, for example in Formula One a driver must complete 90% of the completed laps to be classified as a finisher. Did Not Qualify / Did Not Pre-qualify (often DNQ / DNPQ) : A failure to qualify or pre-qualify for a race. Most often because the driver was too slow to make it into a limited number of grid positions, or was slower than the 107% rule. Refer 107% rule. Did Not Start (often DNS) : A driver who did not attempt to compete in a race, even though they may have competed in practice sessions and/or qualifying. Not the same as the DNA already mentioned. ;Digger: dragster (as distinct from a bodied car or flopper).Emmons, Don, \\"R&C; Modelrama\\" in Rod & Custom, 9/00, p.147. ;Dirty air: The air disrupted by a car when it moves at speed, which can cause aerodynamic difficulties for a car following closely behind. The opposite of clean air. Disqualify (often DQ or DSQ) : Where a competitor is removed from the results, usually in penalty for a technical infringement. Sometimes, but not always, interchangeable with Excluded. ;Dogleg: A gentle turn or kink on a racing circuit, usually associated with road courses, but also present on oval tracks. On road courses, a dogleg may be present on a long straightaway (e.g. Mid-Ohio), curving the straight slightly, but usually not enough to require drivers to slow down much for the turn. On an oval, a dogleg can be located on the frontstretch (e.g. Charlotte) or ISM Raceway Phoenix) creating an oblong shape, adding a challenge, increasing sightlines for fans, and again, usually not requiring drivers to slow down for the extra curve. A quad-oval is also referred to as a \\"double dogleg.\\"(See Charlotte or Atlanta Motor Speedway) Some tracks classify the dogleg as a turn (Mid Ohio turn 3) or not (Charlotte). Also known as a sweeper. A drift competition in progress ;Doped (or Dope): (drag racing) commonly used word in the southern states if the car is using nitrous or propane injection on diesels. ;Door-slammer: Drag racing term used to group vehicles, usually sedan bodied, that still have functional doors for driver access to the vehicle, as opposed to Funny cars which have a single lightweight outer body draped over the racing chassis. ;Downforce: Increased force holding the car onto the track. This is created by the aerodynamics or aerodynamic aids (F1 wings, etc.) of a vehicle which causes a \\"reverse lift\\" effect. That is, creating an area of low pressure (suction) under the car and/or under the wing(s) or other aids fixed to the car, the higher pressure above forcing the tires harder to the ground, effectively increasing the static friction. This allows it to travel faster through a corner, at the cost of having a reduced overall top speed, since drag is proportionate to lift and downforce is caused by lift. ;Drafting: A technique where multiple vehicles align in a close group reducing the overall effect of drag due to exploiting the lead object's slipstream. Same as slipstreaming. ;Drag Reduction System: A mechanically activated element of the rear wing of modern Formula One cars, where in a predetermined position on the circuit a wing element will open, moving from steeply inclined to flat, thus reducing the amount of drag generated by the rear wing, increasing its top speed on a straightaway. The mechanism artificially assists overtaking with additional benefit of overcoming Dirty Air issues while following cars closely. ;Drifting: Drifting is a form of motorsport in which drivers intentionally provoke constant oversteering slides while preserving vehicle control and a high exit speed. In motor racing, drifting is a cornering technique (also called a four-wheel drift) where a car takes a high-speed corner held at an angle on the track without major steering inputs, balancing natural understeer with power oversteer. ;Drive-through penalty: A penalty applied by race officials while the race is underway. A competitor is directed to drive into the pit lane and travel its length at much reduced speed (pit lanes are mostly speed-limited to protect the pitcrew and marshals) losing significant track position in the process. When the driver is serving their drive through penalty they are not allowed to stop anywhere in the pits. See also Stop-go penalty. Drivers' meeting before a motocross race ;Drivers' meeting: A meeting where drivers and officials meet before a race to discuss the upcoming event. Also referred to as Drivers' briefing or Driver and Crew Chief meeting, as in some series, the driver and their crew chief must attend. ;DRS: see Drag Reduction System ;Dry line: On a drying circuit, the racing line that becomes dry first as the cars displace water from it. E ;Early Doors: A popular term used by competitors when referring to the early stages of the series' season. The esses at Road Atlanta ;Esses: Sequences of alternating turns on a road course, resembling the letter 'S'. ;E.T.: Elapsed Time. A term used in drag racing about the total time the run took, from start, to finish. ;E.T. Slip: (drag racing) Slip of paper turned in by the race timer which denotes elapsed time for both drivers, and who won the race; it may also include reaction time and \\"60 foot\\" time. This is an official document, used for timekeeping. Also known as a timeslip. Excluded (often EXC or EXCL) : Removed from competition before the race has started, generally due to an infringement during practice or qualifying. ;ERS: Energy Recovery System. Part of the hybrid engines used in Formula One since 2014, that recover energy from the brakes and heat and stores it in batteries, which is then used to boost power. It combines both a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS), known officially as the Motor Generator Unit ‚Äì Kinetic (MGU-K), and a system recovering heat from the turbocharger, officially known as the Motor Generator Unit ‚Äì Heat (MGU-H). F ;Factory-backed: A racing team/driver that competes with official sanction and financial support from a manufacturer. In Europe, known as a works team. ;Factory team: A more specific version of Factory-backed referring to racing teams run directly from the factory of the vehicle manufacturer. ;Fan car: Usually refers specifically to the Brabham BT46 Formula One car, although the concept was actually pioneered by sports car manufacturer Chaparral Cars on the Chaparral 2J. The placement of a large fan at the rear of the chassis driven either independently or by the engine with the purpose of creating negative air-pressure underneath the car to create additional downforce for increased cornering speed. ;Fastest lap: fastest time in which a lap was completed by a driver during a race. Sometimes rewarded with bonus championship points. ;Field: The competing cars in an event. ;Field-filler: A driver or team usually slower than the majority of the field that only participates if there are open spots. See also start and park. ;First or Worse: In drag racing, if both drivers commit a foul, the driver who commits the foul first loses, unless it is two separate fouls, where the loser is the driver who committed the worse foul; (a foul start is worse than a break out, in a bracket class with breakout rules in effect, then a lane violation is worse than foul start, and failure to participate in a post-run inspection is worst). The \\"worse\\" part is in case of a double breakout, the driver closer to their index wins. If one driver commits a foul start, but the opponent crosses a boundary line (wall or center line), the driver who commits the red light wins. The only double disqualification fouls are deep staging (if it is prohibited in the rule book), leaving before the tree is activated (officials can use video evidence to determine who left first), or crossing the boundary line (although an official has the right to declare the driver who crossed the line second was forced; in a final, only the first to cross the line is disqualified). In a single pass via bye run or opponent breakdown, or a left before tree is activated situation (second driver only), any boundary line foul, nor not finishing the run, will result in the driver's time being disallowed and credited with a \\"No Time - Took the Green Light\\" win. ;Flag-to- flag coverage: Television or radio coverage that consists of the entire race start-to-finish rather than highlights, tape delayed, \\"packaged\\" coverage, or highlights of the first portion of the race before broadcasting the final quarter of the race live. Derives from green flag (start) to checkered flag (finish). Instituted largely in the late 1970s, with the 1979 Daytona 500 being the first major 500-mile race with live, flag-to-flag coverage. ;Flat spot: When a wheel locks under braking, the car skids and leaves a flat spot on the section of the tyre that was touching the ground at the time. ;Flopper: (drag racing) Funny Car, short for \\"fender flopper.\\" Coined by dragster crews in the late 1960s to separate Funny Cars, which had fiberglass bodies with fenders, from dragsters. Erroneously attributed to flip-top bodies of Funny Cars. ;Flying lap: A lap started by a competitor at optimum speed, as opposed to a lap from a standing start, usually in qualifying. ;Flying Start: (See Rolling Start) ;Formation lap: The lap cars make before forming up on the grid for the start. ;Formula racing: A type of racing, generally open wheeled, where the conditions of technical entry comply with strict rules or formulae. ;Free practice: When drivers or riders learn the circuit and/or teams experiment with race settings for the track. ;Fuel: (drag racing) mix of methanol and nitromethane (\\"pop,\\" nitro); race class using it. ;Fuel cell: A fuel tank with a flexible inner liner to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle. Mandatory in most forms of motorsport. ;Fueler: (drag racing) any car running fuel or in Fuel class (most often, TFD or TF/FC). ;Full course yellow: When yellow flags are deployed at every flag point around a race circuit and a Safety Car leads the field until a hazard is cleared. Funny Car ;Funny Car: (drag racing) a vehicle with a single-piece body draped over the chassis which is lifted off or rear-hinged to allow the driver access to the cabin; a race class for such a car G ;Gap: A: drag racing) Beating an opponent in a heads up drag race with a visible distance between the 2 competitors or B: non drag racing) distance in time between two drivers ;Garagiste: Also called garagistas, disparaging term given by Enzo Ferrari to describe the new wave of British racing cars such as Cooper and Team Lotus that challenged his team with a smaller budget. ;Gasser: bodied drag racer running on gasoline (before Pro Stock was introduced) ;Gentleman driver: in sportscar racing, typically refers to a driver who is not a professional racing driver. These drivers' primary source of income is not related to motorsport. Most sportscar racing categories today use a driver rating system where notable drivers with major accomplishment in single-seater competition and under 50 years of age are platinum, drivers with major wins in domestic motorsport or platinum-level drivers 50-59 are gold, gentleman drivers who are experienced are silver, and gentleman drivers with an entry-level (B) international licence, or platinum- level drivers older than 60 (Emerson Fittipaldi raced in the 2014 6 Hours of S√£o Paulo as a bronze driver because of his age) are declared bronze. Many series require gentleman drivers in lower-level categories (P2 and GTE-AM in WEC, P2 and GT3/GTD in IMSA) and only allow one professional driver in a three-driver team in those classes. ;Graining: When small grains of rubber start coming off a tyre. See also marbles. ;Grand chelem:Also called Grand Slam. To qualify on pole, set the fastest lap, win and lead every lap of a Grand Prix. ;Grand marshal: Ceremonial marshaling role at a race meeting. Largely held by celebrities or retired notable drivers with no actual duties or responsibilities beyond the waving of a flag to commence activity or to announce the traditional start your engines prior to some races. ;Gravel trap: Off-track run-off area, usually positioned on the outside of corners, filled with gravel intended to slow down and stop cars that have left the track at speed. Generally there are tyre barriers between a gravel trap and the catch fencing, in order to protect the spectators. Sometimes nicknamed \\"kitty litter\\" for its visual resemblance. ;Green track: A paved race course that is clean from rubber buildup, oil/grease, marbles (see below), and debris, typically cleansed by means of a recent rain shower. Depending on the track and/or racing series, a green track may be favorable or unfavorable. Track crews may use jet blowers to remove marbles and debris from the surface, to mimic favorable \\"green track\\" conditions. However, a green track may be unfavorable due to reduced traction. ;Green-white-checker finish: When a full- course caution comes out right before the end of a race, the race is extended beyond its scheduled distance. Depending on sanctioning body, there may be either one or multiple attempts at a restart, between one and five laps, before the race is declared officially over. NASCAR's national series will have a maximum of three attempts if the penultimate lap only under caution, while some short track races have unlimited attempts at a span between one and five consecutive green-flag laps. In British Superbike Championship motorcycle racing, if a caution is called in the final third of the race, three additional laps will be added on the ensuing restart in a green-white-checker style finish.Error ;Grenade: wreck an engine (the engine \\"grenaded\\") so violently that internal parts of the engine break through the block and / or bolt on parts (cylinder heads, oil pans, etc.) to blow up the engine. Distinct from \\"popping the blower\\". A hand-grenade engine is a usually derogatory term for an engine tuned to maximise engine power at the cost of low mechanical reliability, or an engine design that is known for failing on a regular basis. ;Grid: The starting formation of a race, generally in rows of two for cars and three or four for bikes. The Indianapolis 500 traditionally has a unique grid of three cars per row. ;Groove: Also called The Groove. The optimal path around the track for the lowest lap time. In drag racing it is about the center portion of the lane, where the cars can gain traction quicker. ;Groove a tire: see Sipe ;Ground effect: A method of creating downforce by the shape of the car's body, notably by shaping the underside of the car in combination with the car's lateral edges in order to trap and dramatically slow the airflow running underneath the car, effectively turning the entire car into a wing. ;Gurney, Gurney flap: A small lip placed at the trailing edge of a race car's aerodynamic wing. Despite its relative size, often only millimetres tall, it can double the downforce achieved by the wing, although at the premium of increasing drag, hence the small size. Named for the man commonly attributed to its proliferation, Formula One driver and constructor, Dan Gurney. Also known as a wickerbill. H Hairpin turn on the Mont Ventoux in France ;Hairpin: A tight 180 degree corner that twists back on itself. ;Handicap: where cars start a race in the reverse order of qualifying, or perceived race pace, usually with timed gaps between cars starting a race. More common in racing's early days than today, the effect was the produce a race result in which all cars would arrive at the race finish together, regardless of the performance of the race vehicle. Another form of handicapping is success ballast, where more successful cars are assessed a weight penalty for every win, and Balance of Power in sportscar racing. ;Hanford Device: a spoiler attached across the back of the rear wing to greatly increase drag. The result is a massive increase in the slipstream, which improves wheel-to-wheel competition as well as multiple lead changes per lap. ;HANS Device (Head and Neck Support device): also known as a head restraint, is a safety item compulsory in many car racing sports. It reduces the likelihood of head and/or neck injuries, such as a basilar skull fracture, in the event of a crash. ;Heads-up Racing: in drag racing, where both drivers leave at the same time and is used in all professional (\\"pro\\") classes. ;Heat: A shorter race which decides the participants of the main race and sometimes starting order as well, usually there are more heats in which only a part of the drivers from the entry list take part. Can also mean part of the main race, when it consists of two or more parts. ;Happy hour: the last practice before a NASCAR Cup Series race.: ;Holeshot: when beginning a race from a standing start: * (motorcycle, off-road, powerboat racing), the rider who is the first one through the first turn at the start of a race * (drag racing) getting a starting line advantage due to a quicker reaction time. The other driver gets \\"holeshotted\\" \\"welded to the line\\" or \\"left at the tree.\\" A \\"holeshot win\\" is any win in a heads-up class where a car wins because of better reaction time, despite having a slower elapsed time (e.t.). ;Homologation: Process by which a new vehicle or part of a vehicle is approved by organizers for usage in racing. It also refers to the majority of the world's road racing sanctioning bodies having a racing class following the FIA's Group GT3 formula. This was done to allow a car to be raced in multiple series with no changes. ;Hook up: (drag racing) Good traction between tires and track resulting in increased acceleration and reduced slipping or smoking of tires. ;Hot lap: (See Flying Lap.) ;House Car: a chassis manufacturer's research and development car ;Hung-out-to-dry: Typically used in context to pack racing; a car that pulls out of the \\"draft train\\" to make a pass or avoid a potential incident, but ends up losing many positions due to having no \\"pushers\\". Numerous cars drafting closely together will drive faster than one car by itself. The lone car hung out to dry sometimes falls all the way to the end of the draft train. Also known as \\"freight-trained\\", or when hung out in the middle of two lines of cars, is said to be \\"in the sucker hole\\". ;Hydrolocking: Excessive fuel entering (flooding) one or more cylinders due to abnormal operating conditions. The fuel can not be compressed, causing damage to the motor. Most common in drag racing. May cause the motor to grenade. May also happen if a motor ingests water through the air intake. I ;IHRA: is an acronym referring to the drag racing sanctioning body International Hot Rod Association. ;Impact wrench: A tool specifically designed for rapidly winding off and on wheel nuts, allowing the changing of wheels and tyres to be performed faster during pit stops. Also known as an impactor, air wrench, air gun, rattle gun, torque gun. ;Impound Rule: General term for Parc Ferm√®, used at certain tracks where teams are not allowed to work on cars between qualifying and the beginning of the race. (see also: Impound race (NASCAR) and Parc ferm√©) ;In-lap: Any lap which concludes with a visit to the pits, especially a pre-arranged pit stop, either during a race or during practice or qualifying. Often drivers push hard to drive fast on their in-lap (despite perhaps having worn out tires) in order to gain time during the pit stop sequence. See Delta time ;Incident officer (often IO or I/O): A motorsport marshal who is in charge of other marshals on the track, allocating duties to them. Second in rank to observer. In hillclimbing, they are responsible for the radio communication. ;Independent: A competitor (team or driver) taking part with no or very little backing from a manufacturer. They have their own championship within the World Touring Car Championship, where there is a strong manufacturer presence. ;Inspector: See Scrutineer. ;Installation lap: A lap which can take place in practice or qualifying, which is intended simply to gain data and telemetry for the driver or team, rather than any intention of setting a competitive time. ;Intermediate: A wet weather tyre of lighter grooving than a wet weather tyre. Sometimes an intermediate is a slick tyre with grooves cut into it. It is used for conditions between dry and wet conditions, most often when the track is wet but it is not actually raining. ;International season: In Australia and New Zealand midget and sprint car racing, the time generally between December and February. Because of Australia being in the Southern Hemisphere, some drivers in North America will fly down to Australia during the time and participate in various meetings before the World of Outlaws season starts in Barberville, Florida in February. The recognised International Season typically runs from Christmas Day (because of the time difference, it usually is Christmas night in the United States where the international drivers are based, when the Boxing Day races start), until the week before the Barberville meeting. The most notable races on the international season there include Australian Speedweek at various Australian tracks starting on Boxing Day and the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic in January. Some notable US-based stars will race at specific tracks during the time, often drawing huge crowds. ;Invert: The portion of the field which is started by reverse qualifying speed. With an invert of five, the fifth-fastest qualifier starts first and the fastest qualifier starts fifth. The rest of the field starts by their qualifying speed (sixth fastest starts sixth). The invert is often not announced before qualifying or a dice/die roll happens after qualifying. J Jet dryer mounted on a pickup truck ;James Bond (Red): In drag racing, when driver's reaction time (when they leave the start line) is seven thousandths of a second after the green light (.007). A \\"James Bond Red\\" is a reaction time of -.007 seconds (red light), which is disqualification unless the opponent commits a more serious violation. ;Jet dryer: A helicopter turbine engine or small airplane jet engine mounted on a pickup truck or trailer. The exhaust from the engine is used to blow debris or evaporate moisture from the racing surface. ;Joker Lap: In Rallycross events each vehicle must run a lap with a detour once during each single race. In events overseen by the FIA, such as the FIA World Rallycross Championship, this lap must be at least two seconds slower, therefore, the alternative route makes the lap longer. In the American Global Rallycross series the Joker Lap is usually a bit shorter than a lap on the original track. The Joker Lap idea was thought up as a tactical component by Svend Hansen, the late father of 14-times FIA European Rallycross Champion Kenneth Hansen, to spice up the competition. ;Jump start: In a standing start, when a vehicle moves from its grid slot before the start of a race is signaled. In a rolling start, when a car passes before they cross the start-finish line or the restart line. When this is done, a penalty is usually imposed. In drag racing, a jump start is signalled by a red light in the offending driver's lane, and they lose unless a more serious foul (boundary line or failure to report to post-race inspection after a round win) occurs. K ;Kerb-hopping: To clip, or drive over completely, the concrete kerbs (curbs) on the inside of a corner. While often the fastest method of negotiating chicanes in particular, the practice is usually frowned upon by race officials for the damage it can do to the kerbs, tyres and vehicles. The practice also can drag debris or water from behind the kerb onto the racing line. ;KERS: Kinetic Energy Recovery System. A device which recovers energy created when brakes are applied and stores it until required to add power in the engine. In 2008 KERS systems started to appear in the World Rally Championship and Formula One followed soon after, where its application is limited to a push to pass system. ;Kit: (drag racing) refers to a turbo kit or a nitrous kit. Using nitrous oxide in the professional categories in drag racing is illegal. ;Kitty litter: Informal term with two possible meanings. It is either a nickname for a gravel trap, or for a material applied to the track surface to clean up a leaking fluid. L A unique livery of Rebellion Racing ;Ladder series: Generally refers to a category or series of lesser importance which in most cases will race at the same race meeting as a senior category. Cars will be generally similar in characteristic to drive but will be smaller, less powerful and/or slower. Competitors will generally be younger emerging drivers who are climbing an apprenticeship 'ladder' towards entry into the senior series. ;Lambda reading: Fuel to air ratio readings, used to determine how much fuel is pushed through the fuel injectors into the cylinders for combustion. ;Lap of honour: A non- competitive lap taken before or after the race by a driver in celebration. Also known as a lap of honor, or, if after the race, a victory lap. ;Lap record: Fastest race lap recorded at a circuit for a category of race car. The circumstances allowed vary significantly, but practice laps are generally not considered official records. Laps recorded in qualifying may or may not contribute but are sometimes referred together with practice laps as Qualifying lap record. The outright lap record is the fastest race lap ever recorded at any particular circuit, regardless of category of vehicle being raced. ;Le Mans car: A slang given by the general public to describe a sports prototype racing car, commonly a Le Mans Prototype and its predecessors including Group C, Group 6 and Group 5, regardless of whether it is competing at Le Mans or not. ;Lead trophy: See Success ballast. ;Lid: The top of something, either a crash helmet or the roof of a car. ;Lit the tires: (drag racing) lost traction, producing smoke. ;Livery: The paint colors and decals applied to a vehicle to mark its sponsorship or team identity. ;Lollipop: A sign on a stick used in pit stops, which is held in front of the car and raised when the pit stop is completed. Though the same basic device is utilized in NASCAR and IndyCar, generic terms such as pit board or sign board are preferred as the sign is not round, but sometimes square, and often is in a specific design unique to the driver or team (such as Kevin Harvick's happy face logo, or a team's number stylised as it fits on the car). In addition, in NASCAR & IndyCar, the sign is usually only used for the driver to locate their pit box. It is pulled back, and not normally used to signal departure as it is in Formula One. ;Loose: See oversteer. M Marshal ;Marbles: Pieces of rubber from tires that accumulate on the racing surface outside of the racing line that are slippery like toy marbles. ;Marshal: A person responsible for signaling track conditions to drivers (through use of flags), extinguishing fires, removing damaged cars from the track and sometimes providing emergency first aid. ;Meatball: A specific racing flag used in some countries to indicate to a competitor there is a defect with the car which has the potential to cause a safety risk to the competitor or to another competitor. Most usually applied to trailing smoke or loose bodywork. The flag is black with a large orange dot in the centre of the flag, looking vaguely like a meatball. Some racing series use this flag to indicate the car being flagged is no longer being scored, due to ignoring orders to pit because of a rules infraction. ;Meth: (drag racing) refers to methanol injection used in conjunction with racing gasoline ;Mickey Mouse corner: A pejorative term for a corner or series of corners on a circuit that are thought to be poorly designed, slow, uncompetitive, uninteresting, and usually difficult or near impossible to overtake through, which detract from the overall challenge of the course. In some cases where the entire course is deemed poorly designed, it can be referred to as a \\"Mickey Mouse track.\\" ;Mill: any internal combustion engine used in a race car (inherited from hot rodding slang) ;Missing man formation: The vehicle on the pole position drops back a row during a pace lap to salute a deceased motorsport personality. ;Mobile chicane: Disparaging slang.

Can be seen standing in the marshal post. Second to Chief Marshal. ;Official: See Steward. ;Oildown: (drag racing) When a car's engine or lubrication breaks during a run, leaving a streak of oil and other fluids on the track. This is punishable by fines, point penalties, and/or suspension. Open wheel car or Open wheeler :A specific type of racing car in which the wheels are not enclosed by bodywork of the car, e.g.: Formula One. Formula Mazda, a one-make series ;One-make racing: Racing equipment that must be identical for all competitors, usually to cut down on costs or for business purposes by car manufacturers. Known in North America as spec, specific parts can be spec, as in the IndyCar Series' spec engine, or the type of car can be spec, as in spec racing series such as Spec Miata. ;Out-brake: Gaining time or position by braking harder and deeper in a corner. ;Out-lap: The first lap to be completed after exiting the pit lane, either during a race or during practice or qualifying. Also known as a reconnaissance lap if it is not taken at race speed, e.g. when a car leaves the pit lane to take up its position on the grid prior to the race start. ;Outright lap record: Fastest lap recorded at a circuit of any category of race car. Most often this does not include qualifying and practice laps but confusingly some sources occasionally include laps not recorded during races. ;Overdrive: (drag racing) The ratio between the revolutions of the supercharger to the revolutions of the engine, controlling amount of boost; see underdrive. ;Overpowering the track: A drag racing term used when talking about a run when the driver loses traction. It is normally used to talk about the actions of the team crew chief. ;Oversteer: Cornering behaviour where the rear wheels do not track behind the front wheels but instead move out toward the outside of the turn. Opposite of understeer. P A pit stop in Formula One ;Pace car: See safety car. ;Pacenotes: In rally racing, notes that describe the course in great detail. ;Paddock: An enclosure at a track used by team support personnel and vehicles, and other officials and VIPs. ;Paint scheme: see Livery. ;Parade lap: A lap before a motorsport race begins where the drivers go around the track at a slow speed, also known as a formation lap. ;Parc ferm√© or Impound: An area which cars enter after they have qualified for the race, where they are not allowed to be worked upon by mechanics unless on strict supervision by the stewards. Some motorsports series other than Formula One refer to this as the Impound. ;Pay driver: A driver who pays for their race seat rather than receiving a salary from the team. Generally has a negative connotation. Sometimes known as a Ride Buyer. ;Pedalfest: (drag racing) where both cars break traction and the drivers have to work the throttle to get the car to regain traction, but keep the car going fast enough to win the race. ;Pedalling: (drag racing) working the throttle to avoid lighting the tires, or as a way to sandbag; \\"pedalled\\" it, had to \\"pedal\\" it. ;Photo finish: A finish in which two or more cars are so close that in times past a photograph of the finishers crossing the finish line would need to be studied to determine the finishing order. While the practice has been mostly superseded by modern electronic timing systems, the location of the transponder in a vehicle is not located near the nose of the vehicle, so stewards often use video replays to detect where the nose (of a car) or wheel (of a motorcycle) crosses the finish line first. ;Pit board: A board that is held up from the pit wall to the side of the finishing straight when a driver goes past, to confirm their position in the race and the number of laps remaining. Before the introduction of radio communication, also used to instruct drivers to pit for fuel and/or tires, or to comply with rules violations. ;Pit lane: A lane, adjacent to the race track, where the garages are located. ;Pit stop: Stopping in the pit lane for repairs, refuelling, and/or new tires. ;Pit wall: Where the team owners and managers sit to observe the race, opposite the garages in the pit lane. ;Pole position: The first grid position, placed closest to the starting line (in Formula One), nearest the inside of the first turn, or both. Usually reserved for the competitor who has recorded the fastest lap during qualifying. A competitor who starts a race there is said to be on the pole. ;Polish Victory Lap: Was started by Alan Kulwicki which is a reverse victory lap. ;Popping the blower: (Drag Racing) When an intake valve hangs open, allowing the igniting fuel in the combustion chamber to leave the chamber. This, in turn, causes the fuel in the intake manifold to explode, blowing the blower off the top of the motor. ;Pre- qualifying: A preliminary qualifying session held prior to a regular qualifying session in order to reduce the number of competitors taking part in the regular session, usually for safety reasons. An example of pre-qualifying is in Formula One in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ;Privateer: A competitor not directly supported by a sponsor or manufacturer. To be privately funded. ;Progressive grid: Where a category races multiple times at a meeting, the starting order for the grid is decided by the finishing order of the previous race. ;Pro tree: (drag racing) timing lights which flash all three yellow lights simultaneously, and after four tenths of a second, turn green. ;Prototype: An endurance sports racing car that does not noticeably look like a standard production model. An informal \\"puke can\\". Though some form is mandatory, this type is illegal at some tracks. ;Puke can: (drag racing) radiator overflow tank, sometimes, used beer cans are used as puke cans, although, on some tracks, these types of modifications are considered illegal. A standard puke can is usually made of plastic, or some high strength polymer, and attached close to the radiator. ;Pulling an Eckman: A term in drag racing, particularly in Pro Stock, when a driver is cited, and fined for racing with a nitrous oxide system; driver Jerry Eckman was the first driver in the NHRA to be indefinitely suspended for such an infraction; he was reinstated after two years. ;Push: See understeer. ;Push to pass: System in which engine power is increased for short periods to create a short burst of extra speed. This can be done by increasing the boost pressure in a turbocharged car, increasing the maximum rpm, or using a separate system to provide power. Also, see KERS. ;Put on the trailer: When a driver has either lost (got \\"put on the trailer\\") or won (put the other driver on the trailer). Named because losing drivers pull their vehicle home on a trailer. Q ;Qualifying: The process of deciding the starting order of a race. See also pre-qualifying. Quick 8 (often Q8) : (drag racing) Quickest eight cars in a defined race. Rules appear to can differ per location/race. R ;R.T.: Abbreviation for \\"Reaction Time\\". In drag racing, it refers to the time it takes for a driver to leave the starting line after the green light. This time can mean the difference between a win and loss, especially in closely matched races. ;Race Director: An official appointed by a series organiser who holds ultimate authority over race operations throughout every event of a championship. The race director is the senior official present, and controls the activities of the local Clerk of the Course and marshals and the other staff appointed by the series. When appointed, they hold the responsibility of deploying the safety car and starting and stopping sessions. ;Racing line: The fastest path around a circuit. ;Rainout: When a race is delayed or cancelled due to rain, or the threat of rain. ;Rail (or rail job): dragster (as distinct from bodied car or flopper). From the exposed frame rails of early cars.

Developed originally by Team Lotus in Formula One. ;Redlight(ed): (drag racing) a.k.a. bulb(ed)‚Äîjump(ed) the start, left before tree turned green. This is a loss unless a more serious (opponent crossing the center boundary line) foul occurs. ;Relief driver: A driver who fills in for another driver in case of injury, or during a race because of exhaustion or pain. ;Restart :The race is started again after a caution or other condition that stopped the race. In the case of a restart from a caution period on an oval track and most road courses, this is accomplished by the safety car pulling off the track, the green flag/light being displayed, and cars simply accelerating back to race speeds. Retirement (often Ret) :see Did Not Finish. ;Reverse grid racing: when the starting order of a race is reversed, so that the driver on pole position, starts last. Occasionally reverse grid is limited to only part of the grid, for example, just the top ten positions may be reversed. Often used to increase the entertainment value of a race, mainly used when a category races several times over the course of a meeting. In midget and sprint car racing, heat races may be run as reverse grid races with a points system that gives points for cars passed as well as finishing points. At the end of the heat races, the combined total of passing and finishing points are used to determine the starting grid for the A Main, and which drivers are sent to lower events. ;Riding mechanic: an early term for a co- driver. ;Rim blanking: see wheel shroud ;Ripple strip: Concrete kerb, usually placed on the inside of a corner, painted in chunks of colour, usually red and white alternately, hence the 'ripple'. ;Road course ringer: (NASCAR) A driver who generally competes only on road courses as a substitute for a team's primary driver. Such drivers are no longer used by top teams in the Sprint Cup Series due to competition changes in the 21st century, but are still frequently used by lower-tier Cup teams and teams in other NASCAR series. Roll cage ;Roll cage: Network of metal bars that criss-cross the interior of production-based sedan-bodied racing cars. Originally created as a safety device in more recent times it has been used to connect suspension, chassis, engine to substantially increase the torsional rigidity of a race car. ;Roll hoop: Looped bar protruding above and behind the drivers helmets in open wheel and prototype sports racing cars. The hoop is placed that in the event of a car rolling over in a crash the car lands on the roll hoop rather than the drivers helmet. It also makes a handy hook for cranes for removing stopped cars from dangerous positions on the circuit. ;Rolling start: A starting method where moving cars start a race after the starter displays a green flag. ;Roof flap: an aerodynamic piece designed to keep a car on the ground when it is traveling in reverse. ;Rumble strip: Variation of ripple strip with an upward-pointed, rounded saw-tooth edge. The saw-tooth effect is to discourage competitors from kerb-hopping. The saw-tooth creates a rumble sound and feel for the competitor when driven over. ;Roost: In off-road racing, the act of accelerating quickly in a corner to kick up dirt, dust, and rocks, usually in an effort to temporarily blind a trailing driver. ;Run-off area: Areas off the track put aside for vehicles to leave the track in case of emergency without accident. S Chevrolet Corvette safety car leads the field in a NASCAR Nationwide Series race ;Safety car: A safety car or pace car limits the speed of competing cars on a racetrack in the case of an accident or caution periods caused by obstruction/s on the track. ;Sandbag: To gain a competitive advantage by deliberately underperforming at an event. ;Sandtrap: An area at the very end of a dragstrip to slow down and stop vehicles that have gone off the track, it is filled with, as the name implies, sand. The design of the sandtrap is intentional, and used as a safety device. ;Satellite team: A second racing team either operated by or in partnership with a larger team but maintaining a separate identity. The team may share vehicles and technology with the main operation, or may develop the careers of upcoming drivers, such as Scuderia AlphaTauri. ;Scattershield: A bellhousing or external shield surrounding a bellhousing, and designed to contain metal fragments in the event of clutch and/or flywheel failure. The term also refers a metal shield intended to contain fragments in case of catastrophic transmission failure.The bellhousing scattershield's invention is credited to Vic King and Pete Wolley for their X/Gas digger in 1959.

Scuffs may be put on a car during a pit stop to improve handling. At times, brand new tires may be 'scuffed in' before a race by practicing in them for a lap or two. (See \\"Sticker tires\\") ;Sector: A section of one complete lap of the circuit used for timing purposes. For the purposes of Formula One, each circuit is split into three sectors. ;Semi-automatic gearbox: A motorsport application, created initially by Scuderia Ferrari for Formula One, in which the driver can change gears manually, but without having to manually activate the clutch. On open wheel race cars it is usually activated by paddles immediately behind the steering wheel, although touring cars and rally usually place the gear shifter as a gear stick in the more conventional position on the centre console, but occasionally is mounted as a stalk off the steering column, when activated, automatically engages the clutch and changes the gear and releases the clutch without any further input from the driver. ;Semi feature, B-main, Qualifier :A qualifying race before the main event, where non-qualified cars compete for a predetermined number of spots in the main event. Some races have a C-main where the top finisher(s) qualify for the B-main. At those events, the main event is known as the \\"A-main\\". ;Setup: The set of adjustments made to the vehicle in order to optimize its behavior. ;Shakedown: The first test of a new vehicle. ;Shootout: See Superpole. ;Short shifting: A technique used, primarily in motorsport, to regain control of a car through a high speed corner. Involves the driver shifting up a gear earlier than usual. ;Shunt: A crash. Usually side to side contact. ;Shutdown Area: In drag racing, it is the extra 440 yards from the finish line, to the sand trap, used to safely shut down the car, and turn it off the track, so the next racers can begin their race. The Sauber C24 Formula 1 car with the right \\"sidepod\\" highlighted. ;Sidepod: Aerodynamic device to improve airflow between front and rear wheels on open wheel racing car which also covers ancillary equipment within car, most often water radiators which are air cooled by ram scoops at the open front of the sidepods. Crew members grooving a tire ;Silly season: The period near and after the conclusion of the racing season in which teams and drivers may begin preparing to make changes for the upcoming season. Potential changes at a team may be new or different drivers, sponsors, engines/chassis, team personnel, adding or eliminating cars. Rumors often run rampant during the early stages of Silly season. In some rare cases, teams may actually implement the planned changes during Silly season rather than wait until the start of the new season. Such a move may give them a head start on the upcoming season, and/or may alleviate \\"lame duck\\" situations. ;Sipe a tire: To use a razor blade to cut a tire's thread causing the rubber to break off. Grooving or Cutting a tire means to use a tool to add additional grooves to a tire to adjust handling for a track. ;Skid plate: Metal plates, most commonly titanium, fixed to the bottom of flat bottomed racing cars on the undertray facing the racing surface, put there to protect the undertray from ground strikes tearing through the undertray. Today less common as racing cars usually are mandated to have a ground clearance that is less critical to hitting the track. ;Slapper bar: see traction bar. ;Sled: In truck and tractor pulling, an implement pulled behind the machine which uses friction to stop the machine. Late model stock cars on a slick dirt track ;Slick (clay oval): A phenomenon caused by the drying out of the clay surface on short circuit oval tracks. The clay circuits that do not maintain a minimum percentage of moisture on the track surface will cause the clay to dry out. This problem will cause the rubber of the specialized clay circuit tires to prematurely wear much in the same way asphalt or concrete paved circuits do, giving the track surface a noticeably black shade. Formula One slick ;Slick (tyre): A tyre with no tread pattern, maximising the amount of tyre rubber in contact with the racing surface. A specialist motor racing application as in wet weather conditions these tyres have little resistance to aquaplaning. ;Slidejob pass: Especially in dirt oval racing, a passing car dives low into a corner, deliberately oversteers in front of the vehicle being passed in an attempt to slow their momentum. The vehicle being passed often attempts to pass back by steering low coming out of the corner down the following straightaway. ;Slingshot: front-engined dragster, named for the driving position behind the rear wheels (erroneously attributed to launch speed). ;Slingshot pass: A pass using Slipstreaming (see below). ;Slipstreaming: A car following close behind another uses the slipstream created by the lead car to close the gap between them or pass it. Same as drafting. ;Smoking the tires: Also called Lighting the hides, or Blowing the tires off. A term used mostly in drag racing when a loss of traction occurs, causing the rear tires to rise, and smoke profusely. This usually happens off the starting line. When this happens during a race, it usually results in a loss, unless the opponent also loses traction as well. ;Spare car, Backup car: A car used by a driver if they have damaged their main car. It may or may not have the same setup as the primary car. Now banned in Formula One for cost- cutting reasons, though teams in many other major racing series have a spare car available at the track. At Indianapolis, it is traditionally called a \\"T Car\\" (\\"T\\" loosely short for \\"training\\") ;Spec: see One-make racing ;Special stage: A section of road or track, closed off used for timed runs in rallying. A rally is made up of a number of special stages. ;Spin turn: A semi-doughnut which a driver use to turn themselves to a correct position on a tight space without the need of a reverse gear. ;Splash and dash, Splash and go: A pit stop which involves refueling the car only, often less than a full tank.Splitter (in white) on a NASCAR car ;Splitter: Also referred to as the front Spoiler, Front Air Dam, or Diffuser. Aerodynamic device placed on the nose of some touring cars and GTs to improve airflow around the nose of the car and sometimes create downforce for the front wheels to aid steering. It is prominent on NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow body style. ;Spoiler: Aerodynamic device attached to the trailing edge of a race car to increase its rear downforce. The difference between a spoiler and a wing is that wings are generally multi- element with air passing both above and below the aerodynamic surface, whereas a spoiler is flush fitted to the car's bodywork. ;Spotter: a person, positioned high above the circuit, who communicates what is going on the track to the driver ;Stagger: the difference in circumference between the left and right tires. It is used to make a racing car turn easier on oval tracks. ;Standard tree: (drag racing) timing lights which flash in sequence five tenths of a second between each yellow light before turning green. Traditional form, before introduction of pro tree. ;Standing start: A starting method where the race machines are stationary on the grid. ;Start and park: A team or driver who qualifies and starts a race but only runs a small number of laps to avoid using up resources (tires, parts, pit crew, etc...). The start and park will intentionally drop out of the race, placing last or near to last, but still collect the corresponding prize money and championship points. ;Steward: The adjudicator or referee at a race meeting who interprets incidents and decides whether penalties or fines should be issued. ;Sticker tires: Brand new tires put on a race car. Nicknamed \\"sticker tires\\" because the manufacturer's labels are still visible. (Opposite of \\"Scuffs\\") ;Stint: The period a driver is at the wheel in an event involving more than one driver in the vehicle. Sometimes refers to the period of driving between pit stops. ;Stop-go penalty: A penalty assessed to a driver for an on-track infraction that requires them to enter their pit box (or in some cases a special penalty pit box) and come to a complete stop before resuming. No work is allowed to be done on the car during the penalty, even if it is being served in the driver's own pit box. Doing work on the car would negate the serving of the penalty, and the penalty would have to be re-served the next time around. In some cases, the car is held in the box for a specified number of seconds before being allowed to resume. Sometimes called a Stop and go penalty. Since the early/mid-1990s, this penalty has seen less use, and is instead typically replaced by the Drive-through penalty. The drive-through penalty requires a driver to enter and drive through the pit road (below the pit road speed limit), before returning to the track. When pit lane speed limits became standard in motorsport in the early 1990s, the drive-through penalty was deemed sufficient, while stop-go penalties (when coupled with the now slow pit speed limits) were now considered excessive. ;Stripe or Strip: The start/finish line. ;Struck the tires: (drag racing) loss of traction, causing them to smoke. ;Success ballast: A method used to level performance between competitors by adding weight to cars that win races or are successful. Sometimes referred to as Lead trophy as the usage of lead bars is most popular in applying the additional weight. ;Superpole, or Shootout: A selection procedure in which the ten or 15 fastest qualifiers compete for grid positions in a single-lap effort without other vehicles on the track. While not specifically referenced, most NASCAR races will use this style of qualifying for all cars. ;Support race: A race(s) that takes place before and/or after the main event race. It may also be held during a qualifying day, and is often used to provide a fuller weekend of track activity. It is normally a race from a lower or \\"ladder\\" series, is usually shorter in duration, and in some cases might feature some moonlighting drivers from the main event. It is analogous to undercard in other sports. ;Super rally: When a rally driver retires on any day, except the last, they can continue the next day incurring penalties for the stages they did not drive, including the one they retired on. Currently, in World Rally Championship, a driver will be given the time of the fastest driver of their class, plus a five-minute-penalty for each missed stage. ;Super Special: Timed special stage in a rally on a purpose-built track, often in a stadium. Usually two cars will set off at the same time in separate lanes, and at the halfway point of the stage they will swap lanes, usually due to a crossover involving a bridge. A similar format is used in the Race of Champions. ;Swinger: (from Sidecar racing) A passenger on a racing motorcycle sidecar who athletically moves from one side of the sidecar to the other, altering a sidecar's weight distribution to assist in cornering speed and in some corners to prevent the sidecar from tipping over. T T-bone ;T-bone: A collision in which the front of a car crashes into the side of another car, forming a \\"T\\" shape. This is one of the more dangerous types of crash due to the relative vulnerability of side impacts where there is much less deformable structure on the side of a car to protect the driver. Also, to crash into another car in such a fashion; the victim is \\"T-boned\\". ;T-car: Alternative term for spare/backup car ;Tank-slapper: When the front wheel of a motorcycle oscillates rapidly, causing the handlebars to slap against the fuel tank. It is increasingly being used to refer to a vehicle that loses traction at the rear, regains traction and loses it again, causing the rear to weave side to side independently of the front of the car. This is more often referred to as fish-tailing. ;: (drifting) Japanese term for individual passes where drivers drive whilst being observed in front of judges in an attempt to vy for the top spot. ;Team orders: The practice of one driver allowing another from the same team or manufacturer to gain a higher finish at the direction of the team management. Often employed to prevent the risk of an accident resulting in damage to both of a team's cars. The practice was briefly forbidden in Formula One as a consequence of the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix controversy. U.S.-based series (NASCAR, IndyCar, etc.) rarely if ever have used team orders, and the practice is widely frowned upon due to sportsmanship issues and fan backlash. ;Tear-off: thin plastic sheets that drivers stack up over their visor or windshield for visibility. Drivers (or pit crews) tear one off after it becomes dirty. ;Template: a device used by sanctioning body officials to check the body shape and height of racing vehicles ;Ten-tenths: Refers to driving a car to its absolute potential. ;Throttleman: In offshore powerboat racing, the boat's second occupant who work alongside the driver, whose role is to steer the boat. The throttleman's position is to adjust the trim tab whilst observing water conditions and extract as much speed out of the boat by controlling the hand-throttle during a race whilst it hops over tides after tides to prevent the propellers from spinning wildly whilst the boat is airborne, which causes the engine to overrev, leading to engine damage. ;Throw a belt: (drag racing) losing the drive belt connecting the engine's crankshaft to the supercharger. ;Tight: See Understeer. ;Time attack: A competition which involves cars running around the circuit in lieu of a qualifying lap. ;Timed race: Instead of running a predetermined number of laps, a race runs for a predetermined amount of time (i.e. 24 Hours of Le Mans). This is common in endurance racing, although series such as Formula 1 have a limit on how long a race can be run (Usually two hours), which means that a race may be ended after the time limit expires but before the predetermined number of laps is run. ;Timeslip: (drag racing) E.T. slip. ;Tin-top: Road car-derived vehicles with a roof, mainly in touring car racing. ;Tire shake: A term in drag racing, when the engine is putting out more horsepower than the drive axle can handle, causing the rear tires to shake violently. This results in a loss of speed, and can also result in loss of steering, and occasionally, lead to on track accidents. Referred to in other disciplines sometimes as axle tramp. ;Top end: (drag racing) finish line of strip; high part of engine's rev band. ;Track: The racing surface. ;Track record: A term referring either to the best performance of any athlete on a certain track, or to the history of a certain racer's past performance. ;Traction bars: (drag racing) rear struts fixed to rear axle to keep rear axle from twisting, which causes wheel hop and loss of traction; also called slapper bars. In FWD cars, commonly import drag racing, used to keep front wheels in the ground. ;Traction control: This regulates the power supplied to the wheels of a vehicle to prevent wheelspin. It is banned in many forms of motor racing. ;Trap(s): (drag racing) the 20 meter (66 ft) timing lights at top end of race track to measure speed & E.T. ;Trap speed: (drag racing) Speed as measured by the speed trap near the finish line, indicative of the maximum speed reached on a pass. ;: (drifting) Japanese term for tandem passes where two cars are paired off against each other over two passes within a heat, with each driver taking a turn to lead. U ;Undercut:Making an earlier pitstop in an attempt to gain time on other competitors. The opposite of an overcut. ;Understeer or push: Cornering behaviour where the front wheels do not follow the steered course but instead push out toward the outside of the turn. Known as push in NASCAR and other stock car racing. Opposite of oversteer. ;Undertray: Flat or stepped flat surface on the bottom of open wheel and sports prototype racing cars. Theory has varied along with aerodynamic developments and regulations, from the sidepod tunnels of ground effect to the flat undertrays of the 1980s in various attempts to use aerodynamics to suck the cars closer to the bitumen, minimising the air underneath the car that could slow its progress. Today most such categories feature a stepped undertray with sidepods siting higher in the air than the centre of the car, usually mandated by series organisers in an attempt to limit vehicle performance. Also refers to flat surfaces extending behind splitters in sedan and GT based racing cars. V Victory lane Brad Keselowski celebrating victory lap ;Victory lane: Also 'Winner's Circle,' because of early motorsport's roots at horse racing tracks, the American term for the place where the winner of a race goes to celebrate victory after winning an event. ;Victory lap: A lap, after the conclusion of the race, where the winning racer drives at reduced speed to celebrate their victory. W ;The Wally: In the NHRA, The Wally is the nickname of the trophy that is earned by the winner of an event, the nickname refers to the founder of the NHRA, Wally Parks. ;Wallies: A slower car, usually found at the rear of the grid. It is sometimes a derogatory term. ;Wastegate: Device attached to turbochargers used to limit the additional horsepower they produce. Usually a mechanical device, activated when the pressure within the turbocharger reaches a certain point, opening a valve, thus reducing boost pressure. Used primarily for safety (speed reduction of the racing cars) or cost (reducing stress on both turbo and engine, lengthening the life of the parts prior to failure or rebuild). Not to be confused with a Blow-Off Valve. ;Wear the shiny off: A term used, mostly within drag racing, when a brand new car either hits the wall, or, in the Pro Stock class, when a new car flips over into its top and continues down the track for a considerable length, peeling the paint, or more common in recent years, vinyl wrap, off. ;Weight shifting: A technique used to reduce understeer. This involves the driver decelerating through a corner to shift the weight of the car from the back to the front, increasing grip of the front tyres and decreasing understeer. ;Wet (or wet-weather) tyre: A racing tyre with deep grooves designed to displace standing water, allowing the tyre to obtain grip in conditions where dry weather tyres (slicks) would aquaplane. Monsoon wet has become a term used for extremely wet conditions. ;Wheel banging: When the wheels of two different race cars slightly collide during an overtaking manoeuvre. ;Wheel hop: (drag racing) violent shaking of the car as the tires lose and regain traction in quick succession. Maynard Yingst performing a wheelie in his sprint car ;Wheel shroud: also known as aero cover or rim blanking. A wheel cover designed to distribute airflow to the brakes, thereby generate downforce. Saw common use in the Group C era, Indycar up to 1993 when banned and in F1 between 2006 and 2009. ;Wheelie: In a rear wheel drive vehicle, when the front wheel(s) rise up in the air under acceleration. ;Wheelie bars: (drag racing) rear struts fixed to rear axle, which protrude out to the rear of the car to help prevent a car's front from raising too high or flipping over on launch. The wheelie bar (foreground) and parachute (gray) on Kenny Bernstein's Top Fuel dragster. ;Wheelspin: When the rear tyres (or front tyres in the case of a front wheel drive vehicle) break traction with the racing surface under acceleration, spinning the wheels faster than they move across the surface. On higher traction surfaces like bitumen the tyre will begin to shred and melt from the friction, producing white smoke. ;Wheelstand: wheelie. In drag racing, an extreme case, with front wheels very near vertical. ;Wheelstander: In drag racing, an exhibition car designed to complete a pass in a wheelstand (wheels near vertical) ;Whip: A motocross technique in which the rider pitch their bike sideways and reposition themselves for the landing whilst airborne. ;Wickerbill: See Gurney flap. ;Wing: Aerodynamic device on many racing cars. The principle is the same as an aircraft wing except in motor racing applications the wing is inverted to create downforce instead of lift, pressing the car onto the road surface to increase traction. ;Wired to the tree: A drag racing term for a racer that consistently beats their opponent off the starting line. Also called Chopping down the Christmas Tree. ;Wishbone: Suspension control arm with three points, shaped roughly like a chicken wishbone. ;Works team: A motor racing team supported by a vehicle manufacturer, usually run in-house at the manufacturer's premises. A works driver is a driver who drives for the works team. Y ;Yellow chequer: A term derived when the final lap(s) in a race is completed during a full course yellow while the field is under the control of the Safety Car. In this instance the yellow and chequered flags are waved together and the race is declared finished with the order the same as when the full course yellow began. Unpopular with spectators because of the anti- climactic nature of the finish, the possibility does make some senior race officials hesitate to use it late in the race, call a red flag to allow for further cleanup of the circuit to ensure a final restart (which is often used anyway for severe debris incidents, especially with carbon fibre), or direct to slow the safety car in order that the hazard may be cleared in time for a competitive race finish. INDYCAR has a Yellow chequer rule, and NASCAR allows it (1) if a race is shortened because of curfew or darkness, (2) if the race is already on its final lap when the yellow must be waved, or (3) if there is a yellow implemented after the leader crosses the \\"overtime line\\" (usually located on the backstretch) during a valid green-white-checkered finish once the race has restarted. In Formula One, when there is a yellow chequer, the safety car will not lead the leader to the finish line, unlike INDYCAR and NASCAR. Z ;Zero car: Used in rallying. Prior to the rally cars running over a special stage several official vehicles run through the course to check for safety, conditions of the road, to see if spectators or animals may be a hazard or for obstructions. Sometimes there are a triple zero (000) and double zero (00) as well as the zero. Zero cars travel the course immediately ahead of the competitors and are usually rally cars themselves. ;Zero Light: Also known as \\"cutting a zero,\\" and a \\"zero R.T.\\" Used in drag racing when someone leaves the starting line at the exact moment when the light turns green (.000). Very difficult to achieve, due to the quick flashing of the lights on a Pro tree.

Signed and dated 1261, the work is the only certain attribution to the Florentine painter. It was painted after he had been taken prisoner in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260, when the Republic of Siena defeated the Republic of Florence. Coppo paid his ransom by executing the work. It portrays the Madonna enthroned with a halo and two small angels on her sides. She is enthroned, and supports the blessing Child, who is holding the Book of the Law in his left hand and has a halo surrounded by a jewelled cross. The heads were painted in the following year by a local artist, who added a sfumato style influenced by that of Duccio di Buoninsegna, but different from Coppo's art. X-Ray analyses have shown the original heads to be characterized by Coppo's more typically Byzantine manner of painting. Unlike the concentrated abstraction of contemporary works such as those by Margaritone d'Arezzo, in Coppo's Madonna the Child is looking in a tender way at his mother, a gesture aiming to humanize his divine status, but perhaps also to represent the love of the Child for the Catholic Church, symbolized by the Madonna. The posture of the two figures is typical of Byzantine painting of the subject.

Jacobson has developed computer models to study the effects of fossil fuel and biomass burning on air pollution, weather, and climate. Jacobson‚Äôs career has focused on better understanding air pollution and global warming problems and developing large-scale clean, renewable energy solutions to them. In 2009 Jacobson and Mark Delucchi published a paper in Scientific American proposing that the world should move to 100% renewable energy, namely wind, water, and solar power, in all energy sectors. He has traveled extensively granting interviews, promoting and discussing \\"the development of technical and economic plans to convert the energy infrastructure of each of the 50 United States to those powered by 100% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes\\". Jacobson has built his own net-zero home to run on renewable energy. In 2017, Christopher Clack, Ken Caldeira, and 19 other researchers challenged the findings of a followup 2015 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In response, Jacobson filed, and later withdrew, a libel lawsuit against publisher PNAS, demanding retraction and $10 million in damages. In 2020 the court ordered Jacobson to pay the legal fees of Clack and PNAS; the amount to be paid has not been finalized. Research Jacobson has published research on the role of black carbon and other aerosol chemical components on global and regional climates. Jacobson advocates a speedy transition to 100% renewable energy, to limit climate change. Jacobson co-founded the non-profit Solutions Project in 2011 along with Marco Krapels, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Fox. The Solutions Project, a political advocacy group, combines presentations of science, business, and culture in an effort to influence energy policy switches to the \\"100% renewable world\\". =Soot and Aerosol= Jacobson began computer model development in 1990, when he started to build algorithms for what is now called GATOR-GCMOM (Gas, Aerosol, Transport, Radiation, General Circulation, Mesoscale, and Ocean Model). This model simulates air pollution, weather, and climate from the local to global scale. Zhang (2008, pp. 2901, 2902) calls Jacobson's model \\"the first fully- coupled online model in the history that accounts for all major feedbacks among major atmospheric processes based on first principles.\\" Several of the individual computer code solvers Jacobson developed for GATOR-GCMOM include the gas and aqueous chemistry ordinary differential equations solvers SMVGEAR and SMVGEAR II, alongside a slew of other related and expanded models, The GATOR-GCMOM model has incorporated these processes and has evolved over several decades. One of the most important fields of research that Jacobson has added to, with the aid of GATOR-GCMOM, is refining the range of values on exactly how much diffuse tropospheric black carbon, affects the climate. Something initially studied by his PhD adviser Richard Turco, when formulating the \\"nuclear winter\\" hypothesis of global cooling. The absorbed solar radiation gets converted to heat, which is re-emitted to the atmosphere. Under other circumstances the sunlight would potentially reflect back out into space, had the light struck a more reflective surface. Therefore as a whole, soot affects the planets albedo, a unit of reflectance. While the more familiar greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere by trapping thermal-infrared heat radiation that is emitted by the surface of the Earth, black carbon warms the atmosphere by absorbing sunlight and re-emitting that energy to the air around it as thermal-infrared heat. Jacobson and others drew from these models, that soot from diesel engines, coal-fired power plants and burning wood is a \\"major cause of the rapid melting of the Arctic's sea ice.\\"David Perlman. Scientists say soot a key factor in warming San Francisco Chronicle, July 28, 2010. Jacobson's refinement to the values on soot and his conclusion that black carbon may be the second leading cause of global warming in terms of radiative forcing was affirmed in the comprehensive review of Bond et al. (2013). Jacobson has also independently modeled and corroborated the work of World Health Organization researchers, who likewise estimate that soot/particulate matter produced from the burning of fossil fuels and biofuels may cause at least 1.5 million premature deaths each year from diseases such as respiratory illness, heart disease and asthma. These deaths occur mostly in the developing world where wood, animal dung, kerosene, and coal are used for cooking. Because of the short atmospheric lifetime of black carbon, in 2002 Jacobson concluded that controlling soot is the fastest way to begin to control global warming and that it will likewise improve human health. However, he cautioned that controlling carbon dioxide, the leading cause of global warming, was imperative for stopping warming. =100% renewable energy= Jacobson has published papers about transitioning to 100% renewable energy systems, including the grid integration of renewable energy. He has concluded that wind, water, and solar (WWS) power can be scaled up in cost- effective ways to fulfill world energy demands in all energy sectors, In 2009 Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi published \\"A Path to Sustainable Energy\\" in Scientific American. The article addressed several issues related to transitioning to 100% WWS, such as the energy required in a 100% electric world, the worldwide spatial footprint of wind farms, the availability of scarce materials needed to manufacture new systems and the ability to produce reliable energy on demand. Jacobson has updated and expanded this 2009 paper as the years progress, including a two-part article in the journal Energy Policy in 2010. Jacobson and his colleague estimated that 3.8 million wind turbines of 5-Megawatt (MW) size, 49,000 300-MW concentrated solar power plants, 40,000 300-MW solar PV power plants, 1.7 billion 3-kW rooftop PV systems, 5350 100-MW geothermal power plants, and some 270 new 1300-MW hydroelectric power plants would be needed. All of which would require approximately 1% of the world's land to be achieved. Jacobson and his colleagues have also published papers for a select number of US states, on transitioning to 100% renewable/WWS energy by 2050. In 2015 Jacobson was lead author in two peer reviewed papers that examined the feasibility of transitioning the United States to a 100% energy system, powered exclusively by wind, water and sunlight(WWS), that also argues as having solved the grid reliability problem with high shares of intermittent sources. In 2016 the editorial board of PNAS selected the grid integration study of Jacobson and his co-workers as best paper in the category \\"Applied Biological, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences\\" and awarded him a Cozzarelli Prize. In June 2017, an article published in the PNAS critiqued Jacobson‚Äôs grid integration findings, alleging errors in methodology and assumptions. The PNAS published a response by Jacobson and co-authors disagreeing with Clack et al's premises and reaffirming the paper's conclusions. Clack et al then responded with details on specific errors in the PNAS response, claiming that each invalidated the results of the studies. Jacobson is co-founder of the non- profit The Solutions Project along with Marco Krapels, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Fox. This organization \\"helps to educate the public about science-based 100% renewable energy transition roadmaps and facility a transition to a 100% renewable world\\". = Opinion on energy systems = Jacobson argues that if the United States wants to reduce global warming, air pollution and energy instability, it should invest only in the best energy options, and that nuclear power is not one of them.Mark Z. Jacobson. Nuclear power is too risky CNN.com, February 22, 2010. Like his PhD advisor Richard P. Turco, who notably coined the phrase \\"nuclear winter\\", Jacobson has taken a similar approach to calculating the hypothetical effects of nuclear wars on the climate but has further extended this into providing an analysis that intends to inform policy makers on which energy sources to support, as of 2009.The Guardian. 2009 The carbon footprint of nuclear war Jacobson's analyses suggest that \\"nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions per unit energy than wind energy\\". This analysis is controversial. Jacobson arrived at this conclusion of \\"25 times more carbon emissions than wind, per unit of energy generated\\" (68‚Äì180.1 g/kWh), by specifically expanding on some concepts that are highly contested.Does Nuclear Energy Really Equate to Nuclear War? January 5, 2011 by Charles Barton These include, though are not limited to, the suggestion that emissions associated with civil nuclear energy should, in the upper limit, include the risk of carbon emissions associated with the burning of cities resulting from a nuclear war aided by the expansion of nuclear energy and weapons to countries previously without them. An assumption that Jacobson's debating opponent similarly raised, during the Ted talk Does the world need nuclear energy? in 2010, with Jacobson heading the debate in the negative.Does the world need nuclear energy? Jacobson assumes, at the high end (180.1 g/kWh), that 4.1 g/kWh are due to some form of nuclear induced burning that will occur once every 30 years. At the low end, 0 g/kWh are due to nuclear induced burning. Responding to a commentary on his work in the Journal Environmental Science and Technology in 2013, Dr. James Hansen has characterized Jacobson's analysis on this topic of greenhouse gas emissions, as \\"lack(ing) credibility\\" and similarly regards Jacobson's other viewpoint of extra \\"opportunity-cost\\" emissions as \\"dubious\\". With the foundation of Hansen's incredulity being based on French experience, that decarbonized ~80% of the grid in 15 years, completed 56 reactors in the 15 year period, thus raising the fact that depending on the existence of established regulator certainty & political conditions, nuclear energy facilities have been accelerated through the licensing/planning phase and have therefore rapidly decarbonizated electric grids. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) regard Yale University's Warner and Heath's methodology, used to determine the Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources, as the most credible, reporting that the conceivable range of total-life-cycle nuclear power emission figures, are between 4-110 g/kWh, with the specific median value of 12 g/kWh, being deemed the strongest supported and 11 g/kWh for Wind.Bruckner et al. 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment- report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf Energy Systems. In: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Edenhofer, O., R. Pichs-Madruga, Y. Sokona, E. Farahani, S. Kadner, K. Seyboth, A. Adler, I. Baum, S. Brunner, P. Eickemeier, B. Kriemann, J. Savolainen, S. Schl√∂mer, C. von Stechow, T. Zwickel and J.C. Minx (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. While Jacobson's limited lifecycle figures, of 9-70 g/kWh, falls within this IPCC range. The IPCC however, does not factor in Jacobson's \\"opportunity cost\\" emissions on any energy source. The IPCC has not provided a detailed explanation for not including Jacobson's \\"opportunity costs\\". Aside from the time required for planning, financing, permitting, and constructing a power plant, for every energy source that can be analyzed, the time required and therefore Jacobson's \\"opportunity costs\\" also depends on political factors, for example hypothetical legal cases that can stall construction and other issues that can arise from site specific NIMBYISM. It is the delay/opportunity cost CO2 emissions that are the bulk of the difference between Jacobson's overall emissions for nuclear of 68-180.1 g/kWh and the IPCC's lifecycle emissions. = Decarbonization assessments = Jacobson's 100% renewable world approach is supported by a 2016 publication by Mark Cooper, who has previously critiqued nuclear energy at the Vermont Law School,The Economics of Nuclear Reactors: Renaissance or Relapse? Vermont Law School, June 2009, p. 1 and p. 8. In 2016 Cooper published, a comparison of the 100% WWS roadmaps of Jacobson with deep decarbonization proposals that included nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture. Cooper concluded that the 100% WWS pathway was the least cost and ‚ÄúNeither fossil fuels with CCS or nuclear power enters the least-cost, low-carbon portfolio.‚Äù This conclusion by Cooper is in stark contrast to a number of publications from 2011 to 2015, assessments by the Brookings Institution, Professor of Economics at MIT, Paul Joskow along with some independent scientists who have analyzed, with a different methodology, the various strategies proposed to get to a global zero or low carbon economy, by circa 2050. In these varied reports, the renewables-alone approach, has been claimed to cost \\"orders of magnitude\\" more and be more difficult to achieve than the more flexible energy paths, that have been assessed.Economist magazine article \\"Sun, wind and drain Wind and solar power are even more expensive than is commonly thought Jul 26th 2014\\"THE NET BENEFITS OF LOW AND NO-CARBON ELECTRICITY TECHNOLOGIES. MAY 2014, Charles Frank PDFComparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity-Generating Technologies\\", by Paul Joskow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, September 2011 Loftus' assessment of some decarbonization plans, including Jacobson's, concluded in 2014-2015, that \\"more detailed analyses realistically addressing the key constraints\\", specifically relating to \\"the costs associated with integration of large amounts of variable generation\\" are needed. Jacobson's 100% renewable world, has raised concerns about integration/grid-stability and the issue of Brownouts damaging equipment, some solutions presented for these issues include an expansion on the reliance of energy storage systems. Jacobson counters these by citing 24 publications, primarily penned by the authors Breyer, Mathieson, Jacobson himself, and Diesendorf, that instead argue, that the \\"100% renewable world\\" is not simply theoretically possible but will work out cheaper than present electricity rates. = Opinions on Fukushima = In response to Jacobson's paper on estimating the health effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which projected approximately 180 \\"cancer-related morbidities\\" to eventually occur in the public, health physicist Professor Kathryn Higley of Oregon State University wrote in 2012, \\"The methods of the study were solid, and the estimates were reasonable, although there is still uncertainty around them. But given how much cancer already exists in the world, it would be very difficult to prove that anyone‚Äôs cancer was caused by the incident at Fukushima Daiichi. The World Health Organization estimates that 7.8 million people died worldwide in 2008, so 130 out of that number is quite small.\\" She later said her remarks were \\"insufficiently nuanced\\". Burton Richter, tenured in Stanford with Jacobson, similarly stated in his critique, \\"It is a first rate job and uses sources of radioactivity measurements that have not been used before to get a very good picture of the geographic distribution of radiation, a very good idea\\". Richter also noted that \\"I also think there is too much editorializing about accident potential at Diablo Canyon which makes [Jacobson's] paper sound a bit like an anti-nuclear piece instead of the very good analysis that it is,\\" and \\"It seems clear that considering only the electricity generated by the Fukushima plant, nuclear is much less damaging to health than coal and somewhat better that [sic] gas even after including the accident. If nuclear power had never been deployed in Japan the effects on the public would have [been] much worse.\\" British author and environmental activist Mark Lynas has criticized the paper's reliance on the disputed Linear no-threshold model (LNT) in its assessment of worldwide health effects. Lynas notes that in a 2007 recommendation, the International Commission on Radiological Protection had warned \\"the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses [LNT] should be avoided.\\" Due to its reliance on theory discredited by U.S. and international radiation experts, Lynas concluded Jacobsen et al's paper was \\"based on junk science\\" and was \\"worse than useless.\\"  Criticism and lawsuit  In 2017, Ken Caldeira and 20 other researchers published the largest focused critique of Jacobson's \\"100% Renewable world\\" paper.A bitter scientific debate just erupted over the future of America‚Äôs power grid David Victor of the University of California, San Diego, a co-author of the critique of Jacobson‚Äôs model for a cheap \\"100% renewable world\\", was motivated to contribute to the paper \\"when policy makers started using this [Jacobson] paper for scientific support,\\" when it was \\"obviously incorrect\\". This 2017 critique resulted in Jacobson filing a lawsuit against the peer-reviewed scientific journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Christopher Clack as the principal author of the paper, demanding $10 million in damages for defamation. News reports and academics have criticized the \\"ridiculous\\" lawsuit. The Wall Street Journal commented it was \\"the wrong way to resolve such [academic and scientific] disputes.\\" The lawsuit drew the attention of The New York Times. Jacobson withdrew the lawsuit in 2018 after re-evaluating the time and cost associated with potential appeals, stating that when he filed the lawsuit, he expected a settlement. In 2020, the Superior Court for the District of Columbia further Ordered that Jacobson must pay the legal fees incurred by Clack and PNAS. The amount that Jacobson will be required to pay has not been determined by the courts, but could be over $600,000 if the full amount claimed by the defendants is awarded.

History Ekaterynoslavsky University (now Oles Honchar Dnipro National University) was founded during the Ukrainian state of Pavlo Skoropadsky in 1918. City of Katerynoslav in 1917-20. Dnipropetrovsk city portal (2001) In 1920 Ekaterynoslavsky University was transformed into Ekaterynoslavsky (later in Dnipropetrovsk) Institute of Education, which operated until 1933. In 1933, Dnipropetrovsk State University was restored, however the revival of the university coincided with the intensification of Stalin's totalitarian regime, which led to mass arrests in a university setting, and irreparable losses of personnel. During World War II some faculty and students went to defend their homeland from the Nazi invaders; others approached Victory Day, working in the evacuation. In September 2000, Dnipropetrovsk State University acquired the status of a national institution. (The city of Dnipropetrovsk was renamed Dnipro in May 2016 as part of the decommunization laws enacted a year earlier.MPs appeal against Dnipropetrovsk renaming at Constitutional Court, Interfax-Ukraine (6 June 2016) Constitutional Court refused to consider renaming Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrayinska Pravda (12 October 2016)) Faculty and staff DNU rector Polyakov Mykola Viktorovych, doctor of physical-mathematical sciences, professor, member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian higher institute of learning, born in 1946, graduated from the mechanical-mathematical faculty of Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1971. He worked as dean of mechanical-mathematical faculty from 1989, and as pro-rector of educational work from 1996. He is rector from November 1998. He is rewarded with orders ‚ÄúFor merit‚Äù of all three degrees. DNU has scientific schools in mathematics, mechanics, radiophysics and electronics, rocketry, neurocybernetic, biotechnology, organic chemistry, history of Ukraine, historiography and history of Ukraine, archeology, German, literature and linguistics.

The teachers and scientists of the faculty created a Regional center of the Ukrainian language history and development, where students‚Äô scientific association ‚ÄúPhilologist‚Äù functions. An annual collection of students‚Äô scientific publications ‚ÄúThe young people are eager to comprehend the word‚Äù was founded. A French speaking students‚Äô theatre and speaking club was founded at the Roman philology chair in 1995. The Ukrainian and foreign philology and art-criticism faculty run first-year student, author's song contests, New Year carnivals ‚ÄúMasks disappear in midnight‚Äù, CFI ‚Äì the contests among faculties, ‚ÄúMiss faculty‚Äù contests and others. The Council of the students organizes visits to children's homes with festival concerts and gifts during some years. The meeting with creators became traditional at the faculty: Irena Rozdobud‚Äôko, Larisa Denysenko, Lesia Stepovychka, brothers Kapranov, Liubko Deresh, Yurii Andrushevych, Serhii Zhadan and others. The students of the faculty conducted an action ‚ÄúDo not be indifferent, find out more about AIDS‚Äù. Students take a part in the cultural life of the university: national circus studio ‚ÄúRaiduha‚Äù, national dance ensembles ‚ÄúVeselka‚Äù, theater studio ‚ÄúHravtsi‚Äù.

Today, ten-string instruments to Ram√≠rez' original design remain available from the Ram√≠rez Company, and similar instruments in a variety of designs are available both from the Ram√≠rez Company and other luthiers, notably from Paulino Bernabe Senior. Background In the early 1960s, luthier Jos√© Ram√≠rez III considered adding sympathetic strings to the classical guitar. He sought advice from the leading classical guitarists of the time, notably Andr√©s Segovia and Narciso Yepes, both of them players of Ram√≠rez six-string guitars. Eventually they came up with a ten-string guitar. Yepes' standard tuning for the 10-string guitar In Ser Instrumento, Yepes mentions that the reasons that led him to carry out the \\"design\\" (dise√±o), of his instrument were acoustical/physical (\\"f√≠sicas\\") and musical (\\"musicales\\"). After some \\"initial protest\\" that the 10-string guitar envisioned by Yepes was \\"impossible\\" to construct, Ram√≠rez agreed to the commission and completed the first of these instruments in March 1964. Yepes hastens to point out that he invented nothing (inventado nada) by adding four strings to the guitar, noting the constantly changing number of strings on the guitar during its history, including 10-stringed guitars of the 18th and 19th centuries. Like earlier 10-stringed guitars, his instrument has an augmented tessitura. However, unlike earlier 6- or 10-stringed guitars, the normal tuning of the strings Yepes added \\"also incorporates all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of twelve notes of the equal tempered scale\\". As Yepes explains, the tuning of the Romantic ten-stringed guitars is \\"not exactly the same, because the tuning that I use is also for the resonance\\") Yepes recalled that after receiving his first ten-string guitar in 1964, he held a private concert for \\"friends, musicians, conductors and composers to listen to my instruments and then let them decide which is the better instrument for my concert. I can honestly say that during the concert I played the same compositions once on the six-string guitar and once on the ten-string guitar. They all preferred the ten-string guitar.\\" Yepes then sought the opinion of his former teacher, Nadia Boulanger. After playing the ten-string guitar for her, Yepes recalled that, \\"She noticed that my playing on my new guitar had more resonance, and this is important, she noticed that I could stop the resonance with my hands if I wanted to. She also preferred my ten-string guitar.\\"; reproduced as Segovia, though, was highly critical of Yepes's innovation, writing in 1974 that, \\"I absolutely do not believe that the guitar requires additional strings, neither at the right nor at the left of its fingerboard ... the six it traditionally possesses are quite sufficient. The inventors of this futile addition in sonority are far from having exhausted the natural resources of the instrument.\\" However, the validity of Segovia's criticism can be called into question: Firstly, Segovia seems to have been ignorant of the predominance of 'multi-string' guitars in the 19th Century, including the 21-stringed harpolyre for which Fernando Sor composed,\\"Marche Funebre (Andante lento)\\", reproduced as Appendix A in . as is evidenced in his claim that \\"Sor....did not feel a need for additional strings\\". Secondly, Segovia incorrectly claims that Yepes \\"added four thick tongues\\" to the guitar. In fact, Yepes added one \\"thick\\" (seventh) string only. As Yepes pointed out, the first criticism from Segovia already came \\"before he had seen or even heard the instrument, soon after Ram√≠rez made the ten-string guitar.\\" Lastly, the questionable nature of Segovia's criticisms of the Yepes ten-string guitar are revealed by the fact that Segovia wrote \\"frequent letters\\" to Jos√© Ram√≠rez III in which his unhappiness with weak \\"notes were always mentioned.\\" Segovia complained that he \\"had to substitute or cancel a specific musical piece from one of his programs because the note that he had to emphasize coincided with one of the mortifying [weak] notes\\". Before the Yepes ten-string guitar was designed to address exactly this problem, Segovia had already complained to Ram√≠rez III about how certain notes on the first string of his six-string guitar did \\"not have the same intensity as the others.\\" See also * String resonance (music) * Harmonic series Notes References =Bibliography=   , reproduced as Appendix D in .   * External links * www.tenstringguitar.info Classical guitar ","title":"Ten-string classical guitar of Yepes"},{"id":"21130940","title":"Badminton at the 1962 Asian Games"},{"id":"21130960","text":"Nimbalkar is a Maratha clan, which derives its surname from the forest of Nimbalak in Phaltan taluka, Satara district, Maharashtra, India.

Westland Aircraft manufactured the Sioux under license for the British military as the Sioux AH.1 and HT.2. Development In 1947, the United States Army Air Forces (later the United States Air Force) ordered the improved Bell Model 47A. Most were designated YR-13 and three winterized versions were designated YR-13A. The United States Army first ordered Bell 47s in 1948 under the designation H-13. These would later receive the name Sioux.Donald, David, ed. \\"Bell Model 47\\". The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. Barnes & Nobel Books, 1997. . Initially, the United States Navy procured several Bell 47s, designated HTL-1, between 1947 and 1958. The United States Coast Guard evaluated this model, and procured two HTL-1s for multi-mission support in the New York Harbor. The most common U.S. Navy version of the 47 was designated the HTL-4, and dispenses with the fabric covering on the tail boom. The U.S. Coast Guard procured three HTL-5s in 1952 (similar to the HTL-4 but powered by a Franklin O-335-5 engine) and used these until 1960. The Coast Guard procured two of Bell's Model 47G and designated them HUL-1G in 1959. The H-13 was used as an observation helicopter early in the Vietnam War, before being replaced by the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse in 1966. The Bell 47 was ordered by the British Army as the Sioux to meet specification H.240, with licensed production by Westland Helicopters. In order to comply with the terms of its licence agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft, which prevented it building a U.S. competitor's aircraft, Westland licensed the Model 47 from Agusta, who had purchased a license from Bell.James 1991, p. 55. the first contract was for 200 helicopters. The first 50 helicopters of the contract were built by Agusta at Gallarate in Italy followed by 150 built by Westland at Yeovil. The first Westland Sioux made its maiden flight on 9 March 1965. Design The Sioux is a three-seat observation and basic training helicopter. In 1953 the Bell 47G design was introduced. It can be recognized by the full \\"soap bubble\\" canopy (as its designer Arthur M. Young termed it), exposed welded-tube tail boom, saddle fuel tanks and skid landing gear. In its UH-13J version, based on the Bell 47J, it had a metal-clad tail boom and fuselage and an enclosed cockpit and cabin. The H-13 and its military variants were often equipped with medical evacuation panniers, one to each skid, with an acrylic glass shield to protect the patient from wind. A single 260 hp Lycoming VO-435 piston engine was fitted to the 47G variant. Fuel was fed from two high-mounted external tanks. A single two-bladed rotor with short inertial stabilising minor blades was used on the Sioux.

Soviet prisoners of war were then placed in front of the measuring device on the wall; and, during the \\"measuring\\", they were executed by shooting them in the back of the neck through a specially created hole in the wall.

Background After subduing several Ghibelline towns, Castracani had conquered Pistoia and from there menaced Florence. The latter's troops moved to face him, but Castracani preferred to avoid a pitched battle; he took shelter in the local burgh of Cerruglio, waiting for reinforcements from his allies, the Bonacolsi, the Visconti and Cangrande della Scala. Besieged by the Florentine commander, the Spaniard Ramon de Cardona, the small garrison of Altopascio (500 men) resisted for 26 days (August 3-29), but in the end they had to surrender to the greatly superior Guelph forces (15,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, mostly composed of French, German and Burgundian mercenaries). The winners put their camp at Altopascio, but started to suffer heavy losses due to the unhealthy environment. On September 21, a party seeking a site for a new camp was destroyed by Castracani's forces between Porcari and Montechiari. Cardona then moved his troops to the plain of Altopascio, which granted better possibilities of escape. In the meantime the forces of Azzone Visconti, for which Castracani had paid 25,00 florins and according to Giovanni Villani's Nuova Cronica had to offer to the Milanese condottiero the most beautiful women of Lucca, had arrived in Lucca. The battle and the aftermath The battle was fought on September 23, as Cardona aimed to obtain a victory before Visconti's men could arrive. A first attack by the Florentine cavalry was successful, but in the second charge they were turned back by the Ghibelline counter-attack; the Guelph infantry was in turn routed by their mounted mates, while Visconti's cavalry, who had suddenly joined the battlefield, cut them off from any chance to escape. Castracani was therefore able to conquer back Altopascio and other towns, while most of the Guelph commanders, including Cardona, were taken as prisoners. On October 2 Castracani reached Peretola and started to sack the territory around Florence for several days. For his victory, he was granted the title of Duke of Lucca by Emperor Louis IV and the city offered him a veritable Roman Triumph, in which the Florentine carroccio was shown in the streets.

The forest was established in the 1930s when California state and federal agencies began exploring how the Central Valley of California's water supply might be increased through management of Sierra Nevada watersheds. In 1938, a area surrounding Teakettle Creek was designated the Teakettle Experimental Area and five drainages were chosen for study. Stream gauge stations and sediment basins were built in the 1940s.

History  TeleBielingue began broadcasts on 15 March 1999, over a year and half after receiving the broadcast licence from the Swiss OFCOM. The channel was created as a partnership among some of the most important media groups in the region: Radio Canal 3, Bureau Cortesi and the publisher of the two most important newspapers in the region, both in French and German (Le Journal du Jura and Bieler Tagblatt respectively): W. Gassmann SA. Today, Radio Canal 3 is no longer a shareholder.

The plateau effect is a force of nature that lessens the effectiveness of once effective measures over time. An example of the plateau effect is when someone's exercise fails to be as effective as in the past, similar to the concept of diminishing returns. A person enters into a period where there is no improvement or a decrease in performance. Overview The plateau effect may appear in learning, when students experience a dwindling (less steady) benefit from their learning effort. Studies of elementary school students have found there is a plateau effect in reading level during the upper elementary years.Lyster, R.: Differential effects of prompts and recasts in form-focused instruction. In: Studies in Second Language Acquisition #26 (2004), pp. 399-432. This effect is shown in the forgetting curve developed by Hermann Ebbinghaus, who established the hypothesis of the exponential nature of forgetting. Ebbinghaus hypothesized that the use of the ancient mnemonic device, Method of Loci, and spaced repetition can help overcome the plateau effect. The plateau effect is also experienced in acclimation, which is the process that allows organisms to adjust to changes in its environment. In humans, this is seen when the nose becomes acclimated to a certain smell. This immunity is the body's natural defense to distraction from stimulus. This is similar to drug tolerance, when a person's reaction to a specific drug is progressively reduced, requiring an increase in the amount of the drug they receive. Over the counter medications, in particular, have a maximum possible effect, regardless of dose. Health and fitness In fitness, the Exercise Plateau Effect refers to when a body becomes accustomed to a certain stimulus and thus ceases to respond to it. Overcoming the plateau usually involves a change in the person's workout, including adding periods of rest, changing volume of exercises, or increasing/decreasing the weight used in strength exercises. Television ratings According to industry consultant Gary Kahan, a television show's ratings plateau after the show reaches a \\"crescendo\\" and then slowly decline over time. This view is disputed by mediocre technical directors all over New York City, but supported by the city's top lighting director. Paradox of the pesticides An example of the plateau effect is found in the paradox of the pesticides. The paradox states that applying pesticide to a pest may end up increasing the abundance of the pest if the pesticide upsets natural predator‚Äìprey dynamics in the ecosystem. The \\"deliberate practice\\" theory In the book Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer, a theory called \\"deliberate practice\\" is brought up. The theorist that came up with this theory was K. Anders Ericsson who said: ‚ÄúOur civilization has always recognized exceptional individuals, whose performance in sports, the arts, and science is vastly superior to that of the rest of the population.‚Äù (Ericsson, The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance)http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf This quote coincides with the three stages because these would be the main topics or ideas that would come in mind to reach the plateau effect in many of people. When these conditions are met, practice improves accuracy and speed of performance on cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. (Fitts & Posner; Gibson; Welford, The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance.)http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf Three stages The plateau effect was mentioned in the book Moonwalking With Einstein by Joshua Foer. The book mentions the three stages that lead up to \\"The Plateau Effect\\"; the theory of the three stages was created by Fitts and Posner. These men base the stages on the theory created by K. Anders Ericsson. The first stage of the plateau effect is the cognitive stage which means ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre intellectualizing the task and discovering new strategies to accomplish it more proficiently.‚Äùhttp://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/51204513930/joshua-foer- on-deliberate-practice The second stage is the associative stage which means ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre concentrating less, making fewer major errors, and generally becoming more efficient.‚Äù The last and final stage is autonomous stage (aka the plateau effect) which means as ‚ÄúWhen you figure that you‚Äôve gotten as good as you need to get at the task and you‚Äôre basically running on autopilot.‚Äù Reaching the final stage of the plateau effect starts the mental exercises to keep the mind guessing. The Plateau Effect: Getting From Stuck to Success The Plateau Effect was popularized in application to daily life by Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson‚Äôs 2013 book The Plateau Effect: Getting From Stuck to Success. The book outlines common causes of plateaus, and the author's findings on how to overcome.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-netflix-could-suffer- blockbusters-fate-2013-05-01 According to the authors, the common causes of plateaus include immunity, greedy algorithm, bad timing, flow issues, distorted data, distraction, failing slowly, and perfectionism.

The San Joaquin Experimental Range was established after a statement on the need for an experimental area in the San Joaquin Valley foothills was prepared in 1934. The initial purpose for the San Joaquin Experimental Range was to learn how to better manage these lands. San Joaquin lands were purchased in 1934 (), with additional purchases in 1936 () and 1937 (). In 1938, another 64 ha were obtained under authority of the Weeks Forestry Act. Of these, 32 ha have been designated as a Research Natural Area. The San Joaquin is managed cooperatively by the Pacific Southwest Research Station of the United States Forest Service and California State University's Agricultural Foundation, primarily for research and education.
