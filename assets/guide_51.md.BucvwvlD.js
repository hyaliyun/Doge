Recapitalization may be motivated by a number of reasons. Usually, the large part of equity is replaced with debt or vice versa. In more complicated transactions, mezzanine financing and other hybrid securities are involved. Leveraged recapitalization One example of recapitalization is a leveraged recapitalization in which the company issues bonds to raise money and then buys back its own shares. Usually, current shareholders retain control. The reasons for such a recapitalization include: * Desire of current shareholders to partially exit the investment * Providing support of falling share price * Disciplining the company that has excessive cash * Protection from a hostile takeover * Rebalancing positions within a holding company * Help to improve the stock of the company during a time of poor economic conditions Leveraged buyout Another example is a leveraged buyout, essentially a leveraged recapitalization initiated by an outside party. Usually, incumbent equityholders cede control. The reasons for this transaction may include: * Getting control over the company via a friendly or hostile takeover * Disciplining the company with excessive cash * Creating shareholder value via gradual debt repayment Nationalization Another example is a nationalization in which the nation in which the company is headquartered buys sufficient shares of the company to obtain a controlling interest. Usually, incumbent equity-holders lose control. The reasons for nationalization may include: * Saving a very valuable company from bankruptcy * Confiscation of assets * Executing eminent domain Nationalisation Is essentially a move by the nation of the company to acquire controlling interest in the company, either through buying majority shares with a motive to: 1) eliminate dominance of the shareholders 2) Own controlling interest in the company It can also be an attempt by the national government to rehabilitate its position financially by issuing bonds to increase public debt and meet immediate liabilities.

In the United States, czars are generally executive branch officials appointed by the head of the executive branch (such as the President for the federal government, or the Governor of a state). Some czars may require confirmation with Senate approval or not. Some appointees outside the executive branch are called czars as well. Specific instances of the term are often a media creation. In the United Kingdom, the term is more loosely used to refer to high-profile appointments who devote their skills to one particular area. United States Development of term The word \\"czar\\" is of Slavic origin, etymologically originating from the name \\"Caesar\\", as with the word 'tsar,' a title of sovereignty, first created and used by the First Bulgarian Empire. The title was later adopted and used by the Serbian Empire and Tsardom of Russia. During the tenure of Joseph Gurney Cannon, he was sometimes referred to as Czar Cannon. This was a result of the power of the Speaker of the House during this time. However, there was a \\"revolt\\" in the House which saw Cannon give up power, as well an overall decentralization of power within the House. During the latter stages of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson appointed financier Bernard Baruch to run the War Industries Board. This position was sometimes dubbed the \\"industry czar\\". One of the earliest known metaphorical usages of the term in the U.S. was in reference to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was named commissioner of baseball, with broad powers to clean up the sport after it had been dirtied by the Black Sox scandal of 1919. In 1926, a New York City chamber of commerce named what The New York Times termed a \\"czar\\" to clean up the milk delivery industry. In the United States, the term czar has been used by the media to refer to appointed executive branch officials since at least the 1930s and then the 1940s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Zimmer, Ben. \\"Czar Wars- How did a term for Russian royalty work its way into American government?\\",Slate.com, Dec 29, 2008. In 1942, The Washington Post reported on the \\"executive orders creating new czars to control various aspects of our wartime economy.\\" Positions were created for a transportation czar, a manpower czar, a production czar, a shipping czar, and a synthetic rubber czar, all to solve difficult problems in coordinating the resources necessary to fight World War II. Not only did the administration of President Roosevelt advocate their creation; in December 1944, Republicans in Congress advocated that a \\"food czar\\" position be created that would have almost unlimited control over food pricing and distribution. Certain of Roosevelt's Cabinet secretaries were called \\"czars\\", despite having been duly confirmed by the Senate, at the point that their powers were increased by statute. Since then, a number of ad hoc temporary as well as permanent United States Executive Branch positions have been established that have been referred to in this manner. The trend began again in earnest when President Richard Nixon created two offices whose heads became known as \\"czars\\" in the popular press: drug czar in 1971,Arthur, Allen. Portrait of a Drug Czar , Salon.com, Aug 30, 2000. and especially energy czar in December 1973Lovley, Erika. \\"Czar (n): An insult; a problem-solver\\", Politico, Oct 21, 2008, archived by WebCite. referring to William E. Simon's appointment as the head of the Federal Energy Administration.Nixon's Decisive New Energy Czar. Time Magazine. December 10, 1973. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908276,00.html Nixon told his cabinet that Simon would have \\"absolute authority\\" in his designated areas, and compared the intended result to Albert Speer's role as the person in unquestioned charge of armaments for the Third Reich. Simon found both the informal title \\"czar\\" and the Speer comparison unsettling. However, at the height of the Arab oil embargo, Simon gave the position a good name by successfully putting into place a mandatory fuel allocation program and calming public fears about shortages without resorting to explicit gasoline rationing. Other examples of this usage include \\"drug czar\\" for the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy – probably the best-known of all the \\"czars\\", \\"terrorism czar\\" for a Presidential advisor on terrorism policy, \\"cybersecurity czar\\" for the highest-ranking Department of Homeland Security official on computer security and information security policy, and \\"war czar\\" to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2005, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued an opinion regarding the use of the term \\"drug czar\\" in prepackaged news stories that had been released by the Office of National Drug Control Policy during fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004. The GAO found that while \\"the law does not bestow that title on the ONDCP Director\\", \\"ONDCP's use of the term \\"Drug Czar\\" to describe the Director of ONDCP does not constitute unlawful self-aggrandizement\\". The term \\"czar\\" has also been applied to officials who are not members of the Executive Branch, such as Elizabeth Warren, named to a Congressional commission to oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2009 and described as an \\"oversight czar\\", and Senate- confirmed positions, such as the Director of National Intelligence, described as the \\"intelligence czar\\" in 2004.  Rationale  Advantages cited for the creation of czar type posts include the ability to go outside of formal channels and find creative solutions for ad hoc problems, and an ability to involve a lot of government players in big issue decision-making, ultimately enabling a huge bureaucracy to begin moving in a new direction. Problems can occur with getting all the parties to work together and with managing competing power centers.Holland, Steve. \\"Obama fashions a government of many czars\\", Reuters, May 29, 2009, \\"Archived by WebCite\\". One explanation for use of the term is that while the American public rebels at terms like \\"king\\" and \\"dictator\\", associating them with King George III or fascist figures of World War II, the term \\"czar\\" is foreign, distant, and exotic enough to be acceptable. And the fact that czar positions are often created in times of perceived public crisis makes the public eager to see a strong figure making hard decisions that the existing political structure is unable to do. Another is that Americans of the era generally adopted exotic Asian words to denote those with great, and perhaps unchecked, power, with \\"mogul\\" and \\"tycoon\\" being instances in business contexts.citation needed  Causes  The increase in czar positions over time may be because as the size and role of the executive branch governments has grown, so too has the difficulty of coordinating policy across multiple jurisdictions. Indeed, czar positions sometimes become important enough that they become permanent executive offices, such as the Office of National Drug Control Policy or the United States Trade Representative. Two legal scholars have also questioned whether Congress has contributed to the proliferation of czars.Cody M. Brown and Jeffrey D. Ratner, White House Czars: Is Congress to Blame?, Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 19, 2009 From 1939 to 1984, Congress had authorized the president to consolidate functions and agencies within the Executive branch, pursuant to the Reorganization Act, which minimized the president's administrative burden \\"of trying to coordinate disparate functions operating under equally disparate authorities.\\" But Congress allowed this authority to expire at the end of President Reagan's first term, leading these scholars to conclude: > Absent reorganization authority, what was a president to do? The president > cannot personally coordinate all disparate functions and agencies in the > massive federal government. Yet, if a policy fails because of poor > coordination, the president is held to account. So it is no coincidence that > as the complexity of government machinery has grown, presidents have > responded by increasing the number of assistants or \\"czars\\" to help with the > management and coordination of the executive branch.  Criticism  The appointment of \\"czars\\" serving the executive branch has been a source of controversy through the years. As early as 1942, an editorial cartoon depicted \\"Czar of prices\\" Leon Henderson, \\"czar of production\\" Donald Nelson, and \\"czar of ships\\" Emory S. Land sharing a throne. In 2009, the non- profit government watchdog organization Taxpayers for Common Sense reported \\"by our count there are at least 31 active Czars, giving the current administration more Czars than Imperial Russia had in its history.\\" Critics who charge that czars are unconstitutional often ground their complaints in Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which states the President may nominate \\"other public Ministers … by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\\" In this stance, a czar appointee is only legal if confirmed by the Senate; otherwise, they can not exist until they receive such consent. Based on their interpretation of the constitutional language, these critics argue that czars should be subject to Senate confirmation. The issue is mostly touted by conservatives and Republicans, and during 2009 grew into a staple of anti-Obama activism. Democratic Senator and Constitutional scholar Robert Byrd has expressed concern as well, with Byrd writing to Obama that: \\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\\" Democratic Senators Russ Feingold and Dianne Feinstein both questioned whether there was adequate Senate oversight of czar-driven activities. The Republican members of Congress allege that \\"climate czar\\" Carol Browner's access to the president had usurped power from other agencies. By September 2009, Representative Jack Kingston found 100 cosponsors for a proposed Czar Accountability and Reform Act of 2009, which sought to prohibit taxpayer-paid salaries to “any task force, council, or similar office which is established by or at the direction of the President and headed by an individual who has been inappropriately appointed to such position (on other than an interim basis), without the advice and consent of the Senate.” and The Obama administration largely downplayed the concerns, saying that he was doing just what many previous presidents had done. A White House spokesperson said, \\"The term 'czar' is largely a media creation to make jobs that have existed under multiple administrations sound more exciting. Every president since Nixon has hired smart and qualified people to coordinate between agencies and the White House.\\" At October 2009 hearings before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, constitutional experts asserted that there was nothing wrong with presidents appointing independent advisors, as long as their authority was exerted in practical, not legal, terms. These experts said that the precedent for \\"czar\\"-like positions had been established with the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Meanwhile, following the September 2009 resignation of \\"green jobs czar\\" Van Jones, for statements made prior to assuming his position, radio and television commentator Glenn Beck targeted several additional \\"czars\\" for increased scrutiny by his audience. The Jones case illustrated that czars for non-confirmation positions may not get as much vetting before being named as one whom an administration knows will have to face the Senate. However, the position itself may not have been that important; Brookings Institution fellow Stephen Hess described Jones as a third-tier adviser reporting to a powerless committee. The historical term itself has come under criticism; in 2009, U.S. Representative Paul Broun said, \\"We do not need and should not have czars. The last time I checked, only pre- Communist Russia had czars, and we are certainly not Russia.\\" Prior to resigning, Van Jones himself rejected use of the term, preferring instead \\"green-jobs handyman\\". Indeed, the Obama administration as a whole tended to prefer not to use the \\"czar\\" term. One Office of Management and Budget veteran said, \\"I'm not fond of the term czar. It's a name with pejorative connotations hung on these people who are coordinators, facilitators, catalysts ... [the Obama czars controversy is] much ado about very little. Appointing individuals to serve as the focal point on some issues of presidential interest is a tested and [sometimes] very effective way of dealing with such challenges.\\" Resistance to the term has itself a long history; the Interstate Commerce Commissioner during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, Joseph B. Eastman, declared he was not a \\"Federal railroad czar\\" upon being appointed transportation coordinator. The need for czars itself brings a critique: Steve Forbes has said, \\"It underscores the inefficiency of government that you keep ... having people, hoping that maybe they will get something done that the massive government bureaucracy cannot.\\" With many czars, the challenge of managing them grows, such as was lampooned by The Washington Post's 1942 remark after enumerating recent appointments that, \\"So far as we can determine, the galaxy of czars is now complete, unless the President should decide to appoint a czar over the czars.\\" The position continued to be a subject of criticism, and in April 2011, as part of the 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a government shutdown, four czar positions were indeed eliminated. Effectiveness Scholars have said that it is not possible to make a universal judgment on the effectiveness of czars. The great strength of czars, their loyalty to the president and lack of other bureaucratic constituencies, can also be a cause of their weakness. While they have direct access to the president, they lack operational authority over governmental agencies and often have little or no budget line. As head of the Office of Homeland Security during the George W. Bush administration, Tom Ridge found that these reasons significantly limited his ability to influence policy. As \\"drug czar\\", William Bennett also noticed that the lack of direct authority, inability to dispense grants, and relative small staff was a \\"potentially debilitating institutional weakness\\" that he needed to overcome. It is important for czars to have staff they have confidence in. When originally naming an \\"energy czar\\", President Nixon suggested that William E. Simon get staff assigned to him from all of the agencies involved in energy policy. Simon rejected this approach, knowing that those agencies would unload their civil service deadwood onto him; instead, Simon insisted that he also retain his existing position of Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and the staff there that he had trust in. The symbolism associated with a czar position be created in a perceived emergency can sometimes be effective in and of itself. During the Y2K run-up, John Koskinen of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion could force agencies behind in preparation to defend themselves before the White House and cabinet agencies. Bennett found in the drug czar position that President George H. W. Bush made extraordinary efforts to demonstrate that Bennett had his support, so much so that Bennett fared better bureaucratically than if he had held a regular Cabinet position. Bennett also found that the czar slot lent itself towards taking a \\"bully pulpit\\" approach. In general, the kind of strong authority that the czar position conveys is usually difficult to actually assemble in American political life; instead, the number of bureaucratic organizations engaged in factional disputes and battling for limited resources is just increased by adding the czar position. If a czar actually is strong and effective, then opposition to him or her rises from the governmental bodies which are losing power, and civil libertarians will often publicly object as well. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the term is more loosely used to refer to high-profile appointments who devote their skills to one particular area. The term was widely used in the British media to refer to Gordon Brown’s 2009 appointment of Alan Sugar to the newly created post of Enterprise Champion, which was dubbed \\"Enterprise Tsar\\" by many news agencies. When David Cameron appointed Sugar - who had been ennobled as a Lord in 2009 - in 2016, the term “Enterprise Tsar” was officially used by the government. The nature of the 2009 appointment, and the usage of the term \\"tsar\\" did receive criticism however, with columnist Tracy Corrigan in The Daily Telegraph suggesting it set as a precedent for the English model Jordan to be made the \\"women’s issues tsarina\\", with Conservative life peer Lord Hunt suggesting he could already be a \\"fallen tsar\\". In 2013, the number and nature of some appointments was criticised, as both the Guardian and Independent cited nearly 300 \\"tsar\\" appointments made between 1997 and 2013.

He lost his fortune in the financial crisis of 1840 and despite his best efforts, never regained anything like his former influence and prosperity. His son Theodore Hack, younger brother Stephen Hack and nephew Wilton Hack were all figures of some significance in the history of the Colony. Early life Hack was born in Chichester, England to Stephen Hack, a banker, and the educational writer Maria Hack (née Barton), sister of the poet Bernard Barton. He was educated at Southgate, Middlesex before going into the leather trade, building up a business in Sussex. On 9 July 1827, Hack married Bridget Watson (born 27 September 1806), daughter of William Watson of Hardshaw, Lancashire. After an illness which affected his lungs, he was advised to move to a warmer climate. While in Portsmouth he met Captain Thomas Lipson, who was fitting out the \\"Buffalo\\" for its pioneering voyage to South Australia. This new colony captured his imagination. He read Robert Torrens's book The Colonization of South Australia and met with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and some members of the South Australian Company and was so convinced of the colony's future that he sold up his considerable business interests and purchased three 134-acre sections with their three accompanying town acres. In September 1836 he embarked with his wife, six children and younger brother Stephen (who was to become an explorer of some noteMr. Hack's Exploring Expedition South Australian Register 27 October 1857 p.3 accessed 7 September 2011 and father of Wilton Hack), on the Isabella, commanded by Captain Hart for the owner Griffiths of Launceston, Van Diemen's Land. A surprise last- minute addition to the passenger list was Sir John Jeffcott, who had been appointed Chief Justice of South Australia, and was \\"slipping away\\" surreptitiously to avoid creditors. The Isabella's first stop in Australia was Launceston, where he spent a month purchasing livestock and equipment, which were loaded on the Isabella for shipping to South Australia.Street Corner History: Barton Terrace Register News-Pictorial 19 September 1929 p.5 accessed 7 September 2011 His purchases included nearly 400 sheep, six cows and a bull, ten bullocks, a large wagon and a dray, three horses and a Timor pony. Another livestock importer from Launceston aboard the Isabella was Henry Jones (1799-1889), son of a prosperous London oil merchant, and, like Hack, an influential colonist.Yelland, E.M., Henry Jones, Esq., J.P. (1799-1889), South Australian pastoralist and pioneer, Pioneers Assoc. of S.A. pamphlet, 1969. From carting to farming Arriving at Holdfast Bay (again on the Isabella, whose captain was the future South Australian Premier John Hart) in February 1837, his goods and livestock were unloaded, but by an oversight the sheep dispersed and were never recovered. He set up the two prefabricated two-room \\"Manning's Portable Cottages\\" he had loaded at Portsmouth; one at Glenelg and one in Adelaide, on the site of the present Railway Station. The bullock wagon was kept busy, carting goods between Holdfast Bay and Adelaide, making £15 in the first week apart from his own work. He was supplying milk (he purchased, for £27 a head, a herd of cows that were subsequently landed from South Africa) and, with his gardener, developing a garden in North Adelaide. In March 1837, at the beginning of the first land sales in Adelaide, Hack purchased a further . In May he lost another consignment of sheep and cattle when the Isabella foundered on rocks off Cape Nelson. He built a more substantial residence in Hindley Street, which a few years later the Government purchased for conversion into a police station. He purchased 1000 acres on the Little Para River for a dairy, and produced butter for sale in the city. He undertook some exploration of the country around Adelaide. On 27 November 1837, guided by his stockman Tom Davis, Hack in company with John Morphett, Samuel Stephens, Charles Stuart (South Australian Company's stock overseer), and John Wade (a \\"gentleman from Hobart Town\\"), were the first Europeans to ascend Mount Barker.The Colonist, 28 December 1837, p. 2. Hack also became involved in public life, sitting on the Street Naming Committee, which decided the names of streets that now run through Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide, as well as the Chamber of Commerce and several other bodies. As part of his business ventures, he was paid £800 for cutting the original channel in Port Adelaide. In 1838, he purchased Blenkinsop's whaling station at Encounter Bay (Blenkinsop had drowned with Sir John Jeffcott at the Murray Mouth the previous December). He squatted 400 head of cattle at Mount Barker, but was moved on in 1839. Not put off, he then bought of land at nearby Echunga Springs and made his home there. His farming venture was initially very successful and it was at this time that he planted some of the first wine-grape vines in the colony. A drawing of his farm by George French Angas, possibly from a sketch by Gawler may be viewed here. (A similar hand- tinted lithograph by J. Hitchen used by Gawler to support his strategy of attracting wealthy immigrants can be viewed here)Kerr, Joan (ed) Painters, Sketchers, Photographers and Engravers to 1870 p.289 \\"Gawler, George\\" Oxford University Press, Melbourne In 1839 he had formed the shipping agency Hack, Watson and Co. with brother-in-law Henry Watson, and spent much of his time and energy travelling between his home at Echunga and Port Adelaide. The Recession and after South Australia was plunged into an economic depression in 1841 when the South Australian Company repudiated debts incurred by Governor Gawler. Hack had numerous creditors who could not pay him, debts to the bank, workers to pay and other ongoing commitments with little coming in and no support from his bank. He was forced to sell his Echunga property and whaling interests at a huge discount. His shipping company ceased trading in 1842 and its assets were taken over by their U.K. manager, Jacob Hagen. Through Hack's efforts, a position was found for Watson as Chief Clerk in the Customs Department. In 1843, with little or no capital, Hack made a living with a bullock team, which he expanded in 1845 with several bullock drays carting copper ore from the new mines at Burra to Port Adelaide and living at Kapunda. He undertook several prospective diggings but found no minable copper. By 1848, he had interests in a timber business associated with the building of Christ Church in North Adelaide, but the death of the contractor and the loss of his workers to the Bendigo goldfields resulted in another business failure. In 1851 he went to the Victorian goldfields, where he was modestly successful and returned to South Australia, where he was engaged as mercantile manager for the solicitor Atkinson (who he left in 1852),http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35968808 then with Hart and Hughes of Port Adelaide. In 1859 he purchased a dairy farm along the Coorong, which proved uneconomical. He tried sheep-farming in partnership with G. M. Brown but footrot caused unsupportable losses and in 1863 the family returned to Adelaide. He worked as accountant for Henry Hill & Co., then John Rounsevell, then as an independent agent. Finally he was employed as an accountant for the South Australian Railways from 1870 to 1883, when he retired, having reached the position of Controller of Railway Accounts. Religion and social concerns Hack was brought up as a Quaker, and many of the Adelaide church's first meetings were held at his home. He donated land on Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide, and contracted for erection there of the Friends’ meeting house, a prefabricated wooden building from the same H. Manning, which is still in use. One of his children, who died in infancy, was buried in its yard. He converted to Wesleyan Methodism in Kapunda around 1845 and later was active in church finance committeesWesleyan Conference South Australian Register 6 February 1874 p.6 accessed 26 September 2011 and management committee of Prince Alfred College.The Wesleyan Conference South Australian Register 1 February 1877 p.7 accessed 26 September 2011 He was noted for his friendliness to Aboriginals and ex-convicts (notably one Jack Foley, who became a trusted employee to the extent of accompanying Stephen Hack to London in 1840), and as a temperance advocate. He was a firm friend and mentor of Henry Inman. Family Hack died at his home in Semaphore on 4 October 1884 (his wife had died on 20 July 1881).

Zamani is a research group at the University of Cape Town, which acquires, models, presents and manages spatial and other data from cultural heritage sites. The present focus of the Zamani project is Africa, with the principal objective of developing “The African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database”. Zamani comes from the Swahili phrase “Hapo zamani za kale” which means “Once upon a time”, and can be used to mean 'the past'. The word is derived from Arabic root for temporal vocabulary, ‘Zaman,’ and appears in several languages around the world.  History  The Zamani initiative was conceptualised in the Geomatics Division of the University of Cape Town by Professor Heinz Rüther in 2001 in collaboration with ITHAKA and Aluka [now an initiative of JSTOR] as the “African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database” in 2004 with a number of sequential grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The project developed out of a long history of heritage documentation in the Geomatics division reaching from conventional mapping of archaeological sites in the early stages of the project to advanced digital modeling of complex sites in its present phase.  Motivation  The documentation project aims to capture spatial information to create a permanent record of important heritage sites for restoration and conservation purposes and as a record for future generations. The project seeks to provide material for education, research and site management and increase international awareness of African heritage on a not-for-profit basis.  Data  Spatial data of architectural structures and historical landscapes are acquired by means of laser scanning, conventional surveys, GPS surveys and photogrammetric imaging with calibrated cameras. Satellite images, aerial photography and full-dome panorama photography are also employed as are contextual photography and videos. The data are captured by the project team during field campaigns. The acquired data are processed to produce Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3D computer models, maps, architectural sections and building plans and interactive panorama tours of the heritage sites. Sites are seen in the context of their physical environment and therefore landscapes surrounding sites are modelled in 3D using satellite and aerial imagery wherever possible. Sites The following is a list of sites which have been documented: Algeria # Djémila # M'Zien (Lemzyen) Cameroon # Mandara Hills: DGB I & II Ethiopia # Lalibela: 13 rock-hewn churches # Axum: Stele-field # Gondar: Fasil Ghebbi Ghana # Elmina: Elmina Castle # Besease/Kumasi: Ashanti Shrine Jordan # Petra: Siq # Petra: Treasury (Al-Khazneh) # Petra: Monastery (Ad Deir) # Petra: Urn Tomb # Petra: Tomb of the Roman Soldier # Petra: Palace Tomb # Petra: Corinthian Tomb # Petra: Silk Tomb # Petra: Theater # Petra: Qasr al-Bint # Petra: Great Temple # Petra: Facade Tombs # Petra: Temple of the Winged Lions # Petra: Turkmeniyeh Tomb # Petra: Soldier Tomb (Wadi Farasa) # Petra: Garden Tomb (Wadi Farasa) # Petra: Renaissance Tomb (Wadi Farasa) # Petra: Triclinium (Wadi Farasa) # Petra: Djinn Blocks (before Siq entrance) # Petra: Obelisk Tomb (before Siq entrance) # Petra: landscape of Wadi Musa and the landscape of Wadi Farasa Kenya # Lamu: Fortress, Swahili Building and historical street scene # Shela: Shiathna-Asheri Mosque # Gede: Palace, Mosque and buildings # Namoratung'a: Stelae field # Turkana Village: village huts # Tot Village: village huts Mali # Djenne: Great Mosque # Timbuktu: Friday Mosque Mozambique # Mozambique Island: Fortress and Chapel Myanmar # Bagan (Several Temple & Pagodas) Sri Lanka # Medirigiriya Watadageya # Polonnaruwa South Africa # Mapungubwe: Iron Age site of Mapungubwe Hill, plus rock art site # Pretoria: Union Buildings # Cape Town: Good Hope Castle # Wonderwerk Cave: cave with early human occupation # Cederberg: 6 rock art sites # Saldhana: Stone age site # Langebaan: Paleontological site # Drakensberg: 2 rock art sites Sudan # Musawwarat es-Sufra: Great Enclosure temple complex and Temple of Apedemak Tanzania # Kilwa Kisiwani: Fortress, Mosque, Palace # Songo Mnara: Palace, Mosque, Buildings, Graveyard # Engaruka: Drystone structures # Stone Town in Zanzibar: 2 Persian baths and Beit Al-Amani Uganda # Nyero: 5 rock art sites # Mukongolo: 3 rock art sites # Kampiri: rock art site # Lolui Island: rock art site # Kokoro: 3 rock art sites Zimbabwe # Great Zimbabwe: Great Enclosure and Hill complex Undocumented sites These sites have been documented by the project team but not included in the database 1\\\\.

This entire set of materials is made available to the scholarly community via JSTOR's Aluka initiative. Access to this collection is free to all institutions and organizations in Africa and portions of the developing world. Libraries and academic institutions outside of Africa can license access to these collections via JSTOR. The Zamani Project website provides a showcase for the data it produces. Subsets of the 3D data, such as panorama tours and flythrough animations can be viewed on the site as well as examples of plans, sections and photographs.  Funding  The African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Database exclusively funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, New York. Administrative support, office space and other academic services are provided by the University of Cape Town and the Geomatics Division at UCT. Additional funds are generated through documentation work for the Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles and the World Monuments Fund, New York. In the early stages of the project UNESCO provided financial support for documentation in Lalibela.  Zamani team  The Zamani team members comprises four Chief Scientific Officers (Ralph Schroeder, Roshan Bhurtha, Stephen Wessels and Bruce McDonald) under the leadership of the Principal Investigator, Prof. Heinz Rüther. Interns from UCT and international university's also occasionally join the team. Occasionally Christoph Held (former team member, currently works with laser scanning manufacturer Zoller and Fröhlich (Z+F)) and Professor Werner Stempfhuber (from the Beuth University in Berlin) accompany the Zamani team on field campaigns.

Description Darwinia squarrosa is a shrub with an erect and straggly habit, typically growing a height of . The fringed bracts around the flowers form a pendent \\"bell\\" which is usually red or pink. These are primarily produced between August and November in the species' native range. Taxonomy and naming Darwinia squarrosa was first formally described in 1852 by Ukrainian-Russian botanist Nicolai Stepanovitch Turczaninow who gave it the name Genetyllis squarrosa. The species was transferred to the genus Darwinia in 1923 by Czech botanist Karel Domin. The specific epithet (squarrosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"rough with stiff scales, bracts or processes\\". Distribution and habitat The fringed mountain bell occurs on rocky slopes of the eastern peaks of the Stirling Range National Park. Conservation status The fringed mountain bell is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). Use in horticulture The species requires good drainage and protection from direct sun. It is difficult to propagate from seed, but cuttings strike readily. Grafting on stocks of Darwinia citriodora may be carried out in areas with unsuitable growing conditions.

The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. Accessed 4 August 2011.World Health Organization. Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative. Accessed 4 August 2011. following the adoption of the Innocenti Declaration on breastfeeding promotion in 1990.UNICEF. INNOCENTI DECLARATION on the Protection, Promotion and Support of Breastfeeding. Adopted at the WHO/UNICEF meeting on \\"Breastfeeding in the 1990s: A Global Initiative\\", held at the Spedale degli Innocenti, Florence, Italy, 30 July-1 August 1990. The initiative is a global effort for improving the role of maternity services to enable mothers to breastfeed babies for the best start in life. It aims at improving the care of pregnant women, mothers and newborns at health facilities that provide maternity services for protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding, in accordance with the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and many national government health agencies recommend that babies are breastfed exclusively for their first six months of life. Studies have shown that breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from serious illnesses, including gastroenteritis, asthma, eczema, and respiratory and ear infections. Adults who were breastfed as babies may be less likely to develop risk factors for heart disease such as obesity and high blood pressure. There are benefits for mothers too: women who don't breastfeed have increased risk of developing heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and hip fractures in later life. The BFHI aims to increase the numbers of babies who are exclusively breastfed worldwide, a goal which the WHO estimates could contribute to avoiding over a million child deaths each year, and potentially many premature maternal deaths as well.World Health Organization. 10 facts on breastfeeding, accessed 20 April 2011. Criteria The criteria for a hospital's Baby Friendly accreditation (2018) include: Critical management procedures 1a. Comply fully with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and relevant World Health Assembly resolutions. 1b. Have a written infant feeding policy that is routinely communicated to staff and parents. 1c. Establish ongoing monitoring and data- management systems. 2\\\\. Ensure that staff have sufficient knowledge, competence and skills to support breastfeeding. Key clinical practices 3\\\\. Discuss the importance and management of breastfeeding with pregnant women and their families. 4\\\\. Facilitate immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth. 5\\\\. Support mothers to initiate and maintain breastfeeding and manage common difficulties. 6\\\\. Do not provide breastfed newborns any food or fluids other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. 7\\\\. Enable mothers and their infants to remain together and to practise rooming-in 24 hours a day. 8\\\\. Support mothers to recognize and respond to their infants’ cues for feeding. 9\\\\. Counsel mothers on the use and risks of feeding bottles, teats and pacifiers. 10\\\\. Coordinate discharge so that parents and their infants have timely access to ongoing support and care. The program also restricts use by the hospital of free formula or other infant care aids provided by formula companies and recommends that when formula is medically needed, it should be given in a small cup or spoon, rather than a bottle and should only be used to supplement breastfeeding. Since the program's inception, approximately 15,000 facilities in more than 152 countries have been inspected and accredited as \\"Baby-Friendly.\\" Recommended alternatives The World Health Organization recommends that if a mother is unable to breastfeed, chooses not to breastfeed, or if her baby (often premature) shows signs that it isn't getting enough breast-milk, a healthy wet nurse or milk from a donor is a healthy alternative to formula. A special formula is manufactured for premature babies, although the World Health Organization recommends it only if breast- milk is medically not an option such as if a premature baby has to be fed formula through a tube to maintain a healthy weight. The World Health Organization advocates the importance of a baby being close to its mother whenever possible even if the mother does not breastfeed. Regional schemes Canada In Canada, the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick have mandated the implementation of the BFHI. All public health units in Ontario have been required to work towards having BFI designation since 2011. In 2012, the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care in Ontario added BFI status to their progress indicators for Public Health Units thus requiring all Public Health Units in Ontario to begin implementation of BFI.Technical Document:Public Health Accountability Agreement Indicators 2011-13 Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Public Health Division Health Promotion Division Other provinces and territories are implementing strategies at regional and local levels.Breastfeeding Committee for Canada. BFI in Canada. Accessed 2 August 2011. As of 2008, 18 health care facilities (9 hospitals & birthing centres and 9 community health services) had been designated \\"Baby-Friendly\\" across the country.New Brunswick Department of Health. New Brunswick Provincial Report of the Baby-Friendly Self-Assessment Survey. March 2008. The B.C. Women's Hospital and Health Centre has been recognized as a breast-feeding and “baby-friendly” hospital by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF since 2008. It is the largest hospital in Canada to receive the designation. China China, now has more than 6,000 Baby-Friendly Hospitals, exclusive breastfeeding in rural areas rose from 29 per cent in 1992 to 68 per cent in 1994; in urban areas, the increase was from 10 per cent to 48 per cent. Cuba In Cuba, 49 of the country's 56 hospitals and maternity facilities have been designated as \\"baby-friendly\\". In the six years following the initiation of the BFHI program, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at four months almost tripled - from 25 per cent in 1990 to 72 per cent in 1996. Hong Kong In Hong Kong several hospitals have shown interest in being designated Baby Friendly. However, only Queen Elizabeth Hospital has advanced past the Award of Level 2 Participation stage and is well on its way to receiving BFHI accreditation. Ireland The BFHI started in Ireland in 1998 under the auspices of the Irish Health Promoting Hospitals Network (a WHO programme). The BFHI in Ireland became an independent registered charity in mid-2016 and changed their name to Baby Friendly Health Initiative. They offer two levels - a participation or membership level in which maternity facilities are encouraged to implement the standards and network with other maternity facilities but with no external assessment process, and the designation level where there is external assessment and on-going monitoring to ensure the standards are met and sustained. Sweden Sweden is considered the global leader in terms of BFHI implementation: four years after the programme was introduced in 1993, all of the then 65 maternity centres in the country had been designated \\"baby-friendly\\". Taiwan In 2014 78.60% of babies were born in BFHI hospitals. Between 2001 and 2013, the increase in certified hospitals was from 38 to 176. United Kingdom The UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative was launched in the United Kingdom in 1995. The Initiative works with the National Health Service (NHS) to ensure a high standard of care for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and babies in hospitals and community health settings. The Baby Friendly Initiative accredits health-care facilities that adopt internationally recognised best practice standards for breastfeeding.UNICEF UK. What is the Baby Friendly Initiative? Accessed 4 August 2011. During each stage of accreditation, the Initiative provides support as facilities implement standards relating to policies and procedures, staff education, effective auditing, educating pregnant women and mothers, and other relevant areas. In 1998, its principles were extended to cover the work of community health-care services with the Seven Point Plan for the Promotion, Protection and Support of Breastfeeding in Community Health Care Settings. In 2005, it introduced an accreditation programme for university departments responsible for midwifery, health visitor and public health nurse education. This ensures that newly qualified midwives and health visitors are equipped with the basic knowledge and skills they need to support breastfeeding effectively. The program's emphasis on applying the standards in post-natal and education settings makes it unique amongst the various Baby Friendly programmes in other countries. There are now 52 Baby Friendly-accredited maternity hospitals in the UK and ten accredited community health-care providers. It has been estimated that if all babies were breastfed, over £35m would be saved by the NHS in England and Wales each year in treating gastroenteritis alone. Despite this, breastfeeding rates in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe: 78 per cent of babies born in the UK are breastfed at birth, falling to 63 per cent at one week. Only one in five babies still receives breastmilk at six months. In 2009, the Department of Health awarded a total of £4 million to 40 primary care trusts in areas with low rates of breastfeeding to support them in seeking Baby Friendly accreditation. By the end of 2013 the success of the initiative in Scotland meant that 90% of Scottish mothers now give birth in a UNICEF-accredited Baby Friendly hospital. This compares with 30% of mothers in England, 58% for Wales and 57% in Northern Ireland. United States The first hospitals verified as Baby- Friendly in the USA were on the Pacific Coast. The first US hospital to receive this designation was Evergreen Hospital Medical Center, in Kirkland, Washington, which was certified in September 1996. All of these early adopters were able to achieve 100% breastfeeding initiation rates. In New York City, the Harlem Hospital Center was the first hospital to receive the \\"Baby Friendly\\" certification granted by Baby-Friendly USA for the city in 2008. In 2011, New York University Langone Medical Center became the second hospital to receive the Baby-Friendly Hospital designation in New York City. As of May 2, 2018, the United States only had 512 hospitals that hold the Baby-Friendly designation. This translates to 24.57% of annual births occurring in a Baby- Friendly hospital. Mothers in the United States face prejudice regarding breastfeeding their children. The US Surgeon General reported in 2001 that 57% of U.S. adults believe that a woman should not be allowed to breastfeed in public places and not all states protect women from being charged with public indecency for breastfeeding in public. A study conducted by Bartick and Reinhold, determined that $10.5 billion US dollars could be saved if 80% of families in the United States were able to meet current recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, that cost-savings jumps to $13 billion saved if 90% of families comply. Lower income households are often eligible for Medicaid and WIC, by breastfeeding, these agencies have been estimated to save $478 during the first six months of the infant's life for each infant. Studies have also shown a positive correlation of breastfeeding with increased professional education of care providers. 86% of Americans rely on professional healthcare providers like doctors, midwives, and nurses for medical advice and recommendations. Classes are then offered in group and individual settings as \\"low-intensity intervention\\" directed by trained medical professionals. Research conducted at large healthcare institutions in Massachusetts has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in breastfeeding rates for mothers who participate in breastfeeding and lactation training. Using a high-fidelity (realistic) breast model for teaching health professionals to assist families with breastfeeding could lead to larger improvements in breastfeeding rates. Criticism One group of authors expressed concerns in a paper published in October 2016. It questioned whether full compliance with the ten steps of the initiative might inadvertently lead to the promotion of potentially hazardous practices and/or counterproductive outcomes. Specific concerns described in this paper included increased risk of Sudden Unexpected Postnatal Collapse, rigidly-enforced rooming-in practices leading to exhausted or heavily medicated mothers caring for newborns, and an unnecessary ban on pacifier use.

For over 25 years, the charity has provided information and support to patients and their families.The Anaphylaxis Campaign The Anaphylaxis Campaign was created to ensure a safe environment for all people with allergies by working with and educating the food industry, schools, pre-schools, colleges, health professionals and other key audiences. It focuses on medical facts, food labelling, risk reduction and allergen management. The charity also trains patients, carers and healthcare professionals through its Allergy Wise online training. They have a nationwide network of volunteer-led peer support groups for people whose lives are affected by the risk of an acute allergic reaction, and to help people with severe allergies to be more confidently in control of their lives. It actively campaigns to raise awareness of anaphylaxis with the general public and with the relevant authorities for better allergy care and treatments. Origins and key people The Campaign was established in 1994 following the deaths of four people from allergic reactions to nuts. Its founder and honorary president, David Reading, was made OBE in the 2005 New Year's Honours List for services to people with allergies.Work of unsung heroes is honoured, BBC News, 31 December 2004 The Campaign's former honorary president is William Frankland, the pioneer immunologist, who died in April 2020.A life in allergy, Anaphylaxis Campaign Olympic swimmer Mark Foster has been the Campaign's patron since 2009.Jaguar Academy of Sport profile of Mark Foster His friend and fellow-athlete, Ross Baillie died following an anaphylactic reaction in 1999. Chef Giorgio Locatelli and global parenting expert Jo Frost are also patrons of the Anaphylaxis Campaign. In 2020, the Anaphylaxis Campaign appointed Dan Kelly, founder of the ‘May Contain’ blog (Instagram @_maycontain) and podcast, as Youth Ambassador. In this role, Dan works with the charity to support and empower young people living with severe allergies. Professor John Warner, Professor of Paediatrics, Imperial College, London and Hon.Professor University of Cape Town, South Africa, became the Anaphylaxis Campaign's Clinical and Scientific Advisory Panel chair in 2020. Making Schools Safer The Campaign's Making Schools Safer campaign provides schools with the knowledge and expertise to support severely allergic children. This includes free school resources, presentations and free online e-learning AllergyWise courses. For two years the Anaphylaxis Campaign – together with Allergy UK, the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology (BSACI), the British Paediatric Allergy Immunity and Infection Group (BPAIIG), and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) – campaigned for a change in the law to allow schools to hold generic adrenaline auto-injectors, and ensure they have sufficient trained staff to operate the device in case of an emergency. From 1st October 2017, the Human Medicines (Amendment) Regulations 2017 has allowed schools in the UK to buy adrenaline auto-injector devices (known as AAIs) without a prescription to use in an emergency on children who are at risk of a severe allergic reaction (known as anaphylaxis) but whose own device is not available or not working. This could be because their AAI(s) are broken, or out-of-date, for example. Universities The Anaphylaxis Campaign has identified that 16-24 year olds are a high risk group when it comes to managing their allergies, and this includes university students. An allergy toolkit was devised, including a booklet with practical tips on preparation and management of allergies in a University setting. Working closely with ‘The University and Catering Organisation’ & ‘Association of Student Residential Accommodation’, The Campaign raised awareness of issues around allergy management through e -newsletters and speaking at regional meetings. Through a partnership with the FSA and Allergy UK, the Anaphylaxis Campaign collaborated on a campaign ‘Easy to Ask’, designed to empower young people to ask food businesses about allergens when eating out. This campaign had extensive reach and media interest. A high impact video called ‘Take the Kit’ was designed and used in a public awareness campaign, to highlight the risks of not carrying adrenaline at all times. This was aimed at 15-25-year olds and reached 900,000 people worldwide. National lobbying The Anaphylaxis Campaign is a founder member of the National Allergy Strategy Group,National Allergy Strategy Group a coalition of charities, professional organisations and industry, that seeks to improve health services for allergy sufferers in the UK. The charity has called for clearer guidelines and greater consistency on food labelling.Experts warn of 'crying wolf' over nut allergies, The Guardian, 24 April 2010 It has also lobbied to remove what it considers to be unnecessary 'may contain' labelling, arguing that food manufacturers should only use these labels when there is a genuine risk to allergy sufferers.'May contain' allergy labels will be more consistent, Food Manufacture, 5 July 2012 The Anaphylaxis Campaign has tried to raise awareness of the problems caused by inconsistency in how severe allergy is diagnosed.Big rise in patients with deadline allergies, The Observer, 16 April 2006 To help improve awareness among frontline medical practitioners, it launched an online training programme, called AllergyWise, in 2011, accredited by the Royal College of Nursing.AllergyWise online training and resources for health care professionals, Royal College of Nursing In March 2011, the charity held a national conference with the Food Standards Agency, the UK government department, on 'Communicating the science of food allergy'.Food Standards Agency e-newsletter, March 2011 Membership The Anaphylaxis Campaign runs three membership schemes.

Family His father was Robert Uniacke Penrose (1800–1857) who married Francis Matilda Austin, daughter of the Revd Robert Austin, prebendary of Cloyne Cathedral. Charles married Henrietta Elizabeth Hewson on 29 November 1882, daughter of Revd Francis Hewson of Dunganston, Wicklow. They had a son John Uniacke Penrose Fitzgerald (27 July 1888 – 11 December 1940) who also joined the navy and was killed on active service in World War II. In 1896 Charles changed his own surname to Uniacke-Penrose- Fitzgerald. Career He was educated at Dr. Burney's academy, Gosport and joined the navy in 1854 on board HMS Victory at Portsmouth. In 1855 he served in the Baltic and then the Black Sea in 1856. He served on HMS Retribution on the China station and in 1860 on HMS Ariadne. On 22 May 1861 he was made Lieutenant. On 24 July 1871 he became a commander while serving as first lieutenant on HMS Hercules under Captain Lord Gilford. Was appointed to second in command of HMS Agincourt, flagship of the second division of the Mediterranean squadron, commander Captain Hopkins. Hercules had been involved in the rescue of Agincourt when her previous commander had allowed her to run aground near Gibraltar. He spent three years on HMS Asia, which was an old hulk moored near Fareham. Lord Gilford was once again in command. The posting was a bad one for an officer concerned about his career, but allowed plenty of leave and hunting. The most onerous duty was that he was sometimes called to sit on courts-martial. In the summer he had a small yacht to sail about in the Solent so as not to get out of practice. After Asia he spent a period on half pay and while in Ireland had a bad hunting accident which required him to lie flat for most of a year while recovering. On 4 January 1878 he was appointed to his first independent command in HMS Rapid in the Mediterranean. Lord Gilford was now a junior Lord of the Admiralty so was able to assist in obtaining the command. Rapid was the slowest ship in the fleet, so was normally used for 'detached' duties. It was fourteen months before Fitzgerald met the squadron commander, Admiral Geoffrey Hornby.Sail to Steam p.2 On 19 March 1880 he was promoted to Captain and was appointed to HMS Inconstant, flagship of the flying squadron. Although he wrote on the subject of sailing, he was an advocate of the complete removal of sails from naval vessels (which frequently were equipped with both engines and sails at this time). In 1884 he was the Captain of the Royal Naval college, Greenwich. In 1886, he commanded HMS Bellerophon. He was one of the public supporters of a campaign for increased Naval funding (alongside Captain Lord Charles Beresford and Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby) which led to the Naval Defence Act 1889 and he continued to be involved in public debate on naval matters throughout his life. On 7 November 1889 he was made captain of HMS Collingwood in the Mediterranean. He was a proponent of rear-admiral George Tryon's ideas that a simplified system of flag signals was needed for battle conditions. After Tryon's death, he distributed a pamphlet seeking to continue the campaign for their adoption. Tryon drowned when his flagship HMS Victoria was sunk by a collision with HMS Camperdown during fleet manoeuvres, which caused both public and naval opinion to turn against him and his ideas. Tryon was held responsible for the sinking and his flag system also blamed. Fitzgerald wrote a biography describing Tryon's achievements during his career, but these efforts rebounded to the detriment of his own career. He continued his writing career by contributing a biography of Admiral Rooke for From Howard to Nelson: Twelve sailors (1899) edited by John Laughton for Greenwich College. He became a naval aide de campe in 1892 and served on the council of the Naval Records Society. In January 1893 he became superintendent of Pembroke naval dockyard. He became a Rear Admiral on 20 February 1895 and from 1897 to 1899 was second-in-command of the China station. He was retired with the rank of Vice-Admiral on 28 March 1901. War with Germany and the White Feather Campaign Cartoon from German magazine Ulk Michel: 'Blut ist dicker als wasser- ist nicht dicker- ist dicker -ist nicht - ist'. Admiral Fitzgerald: 'Das wollen wir mal sehen' In 1904 he was requested to write an article for the Deutsche review on British naval policy. He had no control over the German translation of his article and claimed it had exaggerated his statements, but the article expressed a British interpretation of the threat implied by German naval expansion to traditional British command of the seas. It included the observation that Britain would be better served by a war sooner rather than later when the German navy would be bigger. The article was used in Germany to whip up support for the naval program. In 1914 Fitzgerald organised a group of thirty women in Folkestone to distribute white feathers to men not in uniform. This was reported in the press and rapidly spread nationwide. The government responded by issuing a badge which could be worn by civilians occupied in war work. A story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle entitled \\"Danger! Being the log of Captain John Sirius\\" appeared in the July 1914 issue of The Strand magazine. It envisaged Britain being starved into submission by eight enemy submarines. The underwater menace came from the fictional country of Norland but was a thinly veiled reference to Germany's naval power. The Strand subsequently published an accompanying piece with a response by naval experts. There was scepticism to the prediction of outright submarine war.

The theatre seats 228 in 9 rows of raked seating and has been reported to have excellent acoustics. The stage is flat, 58’ wide from wall to wall, with a 36’ curtain opening. From the main tabs it is 19’ back to the cyclorama and 8’ forward to the front of the stage. The theatre has also been used by the Woking Drama Association (\\"WDA\\") to host the Woking Drama Festival and the British All Winners Festival on those occasions when it has been invited to do so by the National Drama Festivals Association. The venue has a unique relationship with the local council, whereby Woking Council owns and subsidises the theatre, with all the administration, staffing and technical facilities run by the Ambassador Theatre Group.  History  Known to most simply as the Rhoda, construction work on the theatre was started in 1973 as part of the larger Woking Centre Halls complex; the cultural part of the redevelopment of Woking town centre at the time. The Centre Halls also included a Concert Hall for large functions, a library, a pool, and dining facilities (where prices ranged from £2.40 to £3.80 per head for a four course meal). Work was completed on the complex in 1975 and the theatre was officially opened to the public under the management of Mike Kelly. A brochure produced when the Centre Halls first opened describes the Rhoda as an ‘intimately styled theatre’ with ‘well tiered and comfortable seating - for theatrical, operatic, concert, film and other similar productions’. Named the Rhoda McGaw Theatre in memory of the local councillor who inspired Woking Council to fund the local dramatic community, the Rhoda has been pivotal in providing a venue for amateur and professional performances for over 40 years. thumb The Rhoda continued to be an important part of the Woking community for the next 13 years, putting on a range of popular shows including musicals, opera, dance, ballet, talent contests and dramas, along with the annual Panto and Miss Woking Whirl competition. thumb By the late 1980s, the theatre had become such an integral part of Woking life that when the whole of the Centre Halls complex was proposed to be demolished to make way for the creation of a new shopping centre and theatre complex there was outcry from the local community. After a series of arduous and protracted negotiations between local groups, such as the WDA, and Woking Borough Council, it was decided that the Rhoda McGaw Theatre would not be demolished, but instead ‘mothballed’ and incorporated into the new Peacocks centre. The Rhoda closed in 1988 as the Centre Halls were demolished, and opened again 4 years later in 1992, with just a few modifications but now alongside the 1300-seat New Victoria Theatre. Overall control of both theatres, along with other arts and entertainment facilities in the new set- up, was vested in a company called Woking Turnstyle Ltd, creating a unique relationship with the local council, whereby the council owned and subsidised the Rhoda McGaw Theatre, with administration, staffing and technical facilities run by Woking Turnstyle Ltd. This was to insure the continued vision of councillor McGaw for the Rhoda to provide community theatre alongside the professional New Victoria Theatre. thumb In 1997, the commercial side of the theatre became the Ambassadors Theatre Group (ATG), and over the years since then the Rhoda has had constant improvements. In 2002 the WDA raised £5,000, and together with matching funds from ATG, more stage lights, lighting desk and stage closed-circuit television was purchased. Most recently, 2012 saw the start of a major £400,000 on-going overhaul and refurbishment of the Rhoda’s facilities, funded by ATG and Woking Council. One of the most successful productions to be performed at the theatre was Woking Amateur Operatic Society's 2015 winter production of Sweeney Todd, directed by James Fortune, which subsequently won two Noda awards for \\"Excellence in Direction\\" and \\"Best Technical Show in the entire South East of England\\".

In the context of supply chain management it can be used to analyse how costs are consumed throughout the supply chain. It shows that each product and customer demands different activities and has a different cost profile. The product and customer profiles are often illustrated using a Pareto analysis curve which highlights those that contribute most to the company's profit and those that erode it. Unlike Activity Based Costing (ABC), Cost to Serve is not resource-intensive and focuses on aggregate analyses around a blend of cost drivers. It gives an integrated view of costs at each stage of the supply chain providing a fact- based view to unravel the complexity of multiple supply chains and channels to market. It enables a focus on both long-term decisions and the prioritisation of short-term actions.

Gaviacetus was named for its characteristic narrow rostrum and the fast pursuit predation suggested by its unfused sacral vertebrae. Location The only known Gaviacetus razai specimen was found in Punjab, Pakistan. (, paleocoordinates ). Retrieved April 2013. Description The skull of Gaviacetus is characteristic of protocetids, but the rostrum is extremely narrow anterior to P3, suggesting some kind of trophic specialization. The well-preserved auditory bulla in 's specimen is dense like in other archaeocetes, is equipped with a prominent sigmoid process, but has 3-5 contacts with the rest of the cranium. Preserved alveoli (tooth sockets) show that Gaviacetus had double- and triple-rooted cheek teeth, but some controversy remains regarding the number of molars. Based on other cranial characters, concluded that Gaviacetus is a protocetid (more primitive archeocetes with a third upper molar) and therefore assumed the presence of M3 though no traces thereof are preserved in their specimen. In opposition to this, , who's specimen is also lacking the essential maxillar part, thought the cranium above the very small M2 to be to narrow for the presence of M3, hence indicating Gaviacetus is a basilosaurid (a more derived archaeocetes lacking a third upper molar). argued against this assignment until more solid evidence has been found. The preserved sacral vertebra was not fused with its posterior neighbour, indicating that Gaviacetus was a tail- powered swimmer like Protocetus, better adapted to pursuit predation than Rodhocetus. The preserved transverse process of the sacral vertebra is distally expanded, suggesting a synchondrosal joint between the vertebral column and pelvis. Although often represented as having small hind limbs,Carl Zimmer (1998). At the Water's Edge. This appears to be the first book to have done so. this is an inference from the general progression of other fossil species towards limb loss; the only postcranial remains found for Gaviacetus are a rib and several vertebrae.

Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics. Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labour markets, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks, such as unemployment, exclusion, sickness, disability, and old age.World Bank. 2001. Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper: From Safety Net to Springboard. Washington DC, USA. It is one of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aimed at promoting greater equality. The most common types of social protection: *Labor market interventions are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets, and the protection of workers. *Social insurance mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill-health, disability, work-related injury, and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance. *Social assistance is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged. History Traditionally, social protection has been used in the European welfare state and other parts of the developed world to maintain a certain living standard, and address transient poverty.United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010. Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics. One of the first examples of state-provided social protection can be tracked to the Roman Emperor Trajan, who expanded a program for free grain to include more poor citizens of the empire. In addition, he instituted public funds to support poor children.Hammond, Mason. “Trajan”. Encyclopædia Britannica. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title;=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia. Organized welfare was not common until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was during this period that in both Germany and Great Britain, welfare systems were established to target the working classes (see National Insurance).“The Liberal reforms 1906-1914”. BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml The United States followed several years later, during the Great Depression, with emergency relief for those struck the hardest. However, modern social protection has grown to envelop a much broader range of issues and purposes; it is now being used as a policy approach in developing nations, to address issues of persistent poverty and target structural causes. Moreover, it is designed to lift recipients out of poverty, rather than exclusively providing passive protection against contingencies .United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010. Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics. social protection has rapidly been used in trying to reduce and ultimately eliminate poverty and suffering in developing countries (mostly in Africa), so to enhance and promote economic and social growth. Types Labor market interventions Labor market interventions, consisting of both active and passive policies, provide protection for the poor who are capable of gaining employment. Passive programs, such as unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labor legislation, alleviate the financial needs of the unemployed but are not designed to improve their employability.Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social-protection/types-of-social- protection) On the other hand, active programs focus on directly increasing the access of unemployed workers to the labour market.Asian Development Bank. Labor. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/labor.asp) Active labour market policies (ALMPs) have two basic objectives: (1) economic, by reducing the risk of unemployment, increasing the ability of the unemployed to find jobs and increasing their earning capacity, productivity and earnings; and (2) social, by improving social inclusion and participation in productive employment. These programs thus aim to increase employment opportunities and address the social problems that often accompany high unemployment. Active policies are a way of reversing the negative effects of industrial restructuring in transition economies and to help integrate vulnerable people furthest from the labor markets.The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/ EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html) They are often targeted at the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. A European Union-funded research as part of the DRIVERS project revealed a linear relationship between investments in national active labour market policies (specifically those directed towards integrating vulnerable groups into employment) and quality of work. It found that European countries with more active labour market policies seem to have healthier, less stressed workplaces. Active labor market programs include a wide range of activities to stimulate employment and productivity such as: *Employment services. These services include counseling, placement assistance, job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services to improve the functioning of the labor market. *Job Training. This includes training/retraining for the unemployed, workers in mass layoffs and youth to increase the quantity of work supply. *Direct employment generation The promotion of small and medium enterprises (e.g., public works projects, subsidies) to increase labor demand.Betcherman, G., Olivas, K. and Dar, A., 2004, 'Impacts of Active Labor Market Programs: New Evidence from Evaluations with Particular Attention to Developing and Transition Countries', Social Protection Discussion Paper Series no. 0402, World Bank, Washington A common issue in implementing successful labor market interventions is how to incorporate the informal economy, which comprises a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries.Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic- guides/social protection/types-of-social-protection) Informal employment comprises between half and three quarters of non-agricultural employment in the majority of these countries. The proportion of informal employment increases when agriculture is taken into account.International Labour Organization. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/secsoc/areas/policy/informal.htm) Most informal workers are not covered by social security schemes, occupational safety and health measures, working conditions regulations and have limited access to health services and work-related measures of social protection. Labor market interventions work to integrate the different strategies to prevent and compensate occupational and social risks in the informal economy. The strategies that include measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks are the most effective.Lund, F., 2009, 'Social Protection and the Informal Economy: Linkages and Good Practices for Poverty Reduction and Empowerment', in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 'Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Social Protection', OECD, Paris, pp.69-88 In general, public expenditure on labor market policy (LMP) interventions falls within three main categories: *Labor Market Services (1) *Total LMP Measures (2-7) training (2), job rotation & job sharing (3), employment incentives (4), supported employment & rehabilitation (5), direct job creation (6), start-up incentives (7), *Total LMP supports (8-9) out-of-work income maintenance and support (8), early retirement (9) Social insurance Social insurance schemes are contributory programs that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums. Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk in the event of shock. However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance. Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance. Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk- pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable. In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.Ranson, M., 2002, 'Reduction of Catastrophic Health Care Expenditures by a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme in Gujarat, India: Current Experiences and Challenges', Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 80, no. 8 Social assistance Social assistance schemes comprise programs designed to help the most vulnerable individuals ( i.e., those with no other means of support such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor), households and communities to meet a social floor and improve living standards. These programs consist of all forms of public action, government and non-government, that are designed to transfer resources, either cash or in-kind (e.g. food transfers), to eligible vulnerable and deprived persons.Howell, F., 2001, 'Social Assistance - Theoretical Background', in 'Social Protection in the Asia and Pacific', ed. I. Ortiz, Asian Development Bank, Manila, ch. 7 Social assistance interventions may include: *Welfare and social services to highly vulnerable groups such as the physically or mentally disabled, orphans, or substance abusers. *Cash or in-kind transfers such as food stamps and family allowances. *Temporary subsidies such as life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis.Asian Development Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/default.asp) Policy issues Universalism vs. Targeting There are two main schools of thought concerning scope of social protection. Universalism argues that each person, by merit of simply being a citizen should be entitled to benefits from social protection programs. Such a policy would avoid means-testing and any conditionalities such as work requirements. One of the greatest benefits to this policy perspective is social solidarity, since everyone contributes collaboratively to a system that everyone also benefits from. Social security is one such example. Moreover, economists have argued that universalism is an investment in human capital that aids the development of a nation as a whole.Mares, I. 2007. “The economic consequences of the welfare state”. International Social Security Review, Vol. 60, No. 2/3. The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report The Changing Nature of WorkWorld Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work. considers social protection from this perspective, describing existing schemes around the world and presenting simulation data on the potential costs. Opponents would argue that universalism is cost-ineffective and unfairly distorts individual efforts. Such an argument points toward targeting as a better solution.Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books. In such a case, the question arises of who should be the target population that receives benefits from social programs. Targeting income vs. capabilities Net income is the simplest method of determining a needy population. Some states use a Guaranteed Minimum Income system, in which all members of a state receive sufficient income to live on, so long as they meet certain conditions.“History of Basic Income”. Basic Income Earth Network. http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html#history . However, proponents of the capabilities approach argue that income is easier to misrepresent, and moreover, fails to target the root causal factors of poverty. Hence, they recommend targeting a minimum level of basic capabilities that will impact quality of life, such as institutional improvements like health and education. Policy examples might include a social floor.ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202 (2012) ILO Recommendation No. 202 Means of provision Social protection is an expensive and difficult endeavor, by any means; the question remains how best to implement programs that effectively aid the people who need it the most. Currently, there are a number of mechanisms that provide social protection in various nations. These policies and instruments vary according to country context. In some nations, governments are strongly involved in the provision of social protection, following a developmentalism model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth. There are also nations which are characterized by dualism, in which there is state-provided protection for those who work in the formal sector, but little to no protection for those who work in the informal sector. Finally, there are nations in which the economy is largely agrarian, and a great majority of the population works in the informal economy. In those countries that have only residual social protection coverage and weak state capacity, social protection is mainly provided by non- governmental means such as kin, NGOs, and individual philanthropic donations. National programs Developmentalism In South Korea and Taiwan, the government provides extensive support for public programs, following the developmentalism model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.Kwon, Huck-Ju. 2009. “The reform of the developmental welfare state in East Asia”. International Journal of Social Welfare. Volume 18, pages S12–S21, April 2009. Dualism In Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa, there is a dualist structure of protected formal sector workers and marginalized informal sector workers.,Lo Vuolo, Barbeito. 1998. Models of stratification via pension policy. The case of Argentina. LASA Conference, Nov. 2004.Ocampo, José Antonio. 2008. “The Latin American Economic Boom”Revista de Ciencia Política, Volume 28 Agrarian-informal In nations such as India and Tanzania, governments struggle to provide adequate social protection, and citizens must instead depend on non-state actors and informal provisioning. Donor approaches International donors and organizations have influenced social protection approaches in terms of both policy discourse and program design and implementation.See Brunori and O'Reilly (2011) for a review(http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29495/) Even though the World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) are the major donors and the lead organizations in the field, other organizations are also concerned with social protection.Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, 'Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection', Institute of Development Studies, Brighton(http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/a-global-review-of-social- protection) The World Bank is a source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries. In order to identify social risks and potential responses, the World Bank developed a tool called \\"social risk management\\" (SRM). The SRM framework includes interventions that focus on managing risks before shocks occur. It is based on two assessments: (1) the poor are most exposed to diverse risks, and (2) the poor have the fewest tools to deal with these risks. The main elements of the SRM framework are: *Risk reduction measures that focus on reducing risks in the labor market. *Risk mitigation measures to deal with anticipated shock. *Risk coping mechanisms to relieve the impact of risk after its occurred.The World Bank.

Jain relics at villages Sonatapal, Bahulara, Dharapat, Harmasra and Pareshnath (near Ambiknagar) are now taken as Hindu relics and some of the intact images are daily worshipped as Hindu deities. Harmasra has Jain temple made up of bricks with a shikhara. The temple has an image of Parshavanatha along with small images of other tirthankars. David J. McCutchion mentions the Lakshmi Janardana temple as a small flat roofed or chandni-type temple built in the 19th century having a base of 20’6” x 11’2”, with terracotta decoration. He describes the large square rasmancha as being like a pancha-ratna, with both or either upper and lower cornices curved. He describes the square rasmancha of the Ray family as having temple-type nava-ratna turrets. Built in the 19th century with laterite and brick, and having a base of 14’ square, it has terracotta decorations and plaster work.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, page 63, 74, 77.

His early works were influenced by Igor Stravinsky, though his later pieces owe more to Granville Bantock and Richard Strauss and even William Walton. Much of his music has been lost. Early life and career Fogg was born in Manchester, the son of Charles H. Fogg, the organist for the Hallé Orchestra, who was his first teacher. His mother, Madame Sadler-Fogg, was also musical (she trained the young Isobel Baillie in singing) and contributed to his musical education. He became a boy chorister at Manchester Cathedral from ages 10 to 14Eric Blom, Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954 where he came under the influence of Sydney Nicholson and Ernest Bullock. His contemporaries at Manchester Cathedral included Leslie Heward and Eric Warr.C B Rees: Conductors You Know: Eric Fogg, in Radio Times No 747, 21 January 1938, p 8 Fogg went on to study with Granville Bantock in Birmingham and served for two years as organist at St John's, Deansgate. Fogg started composing very early and his output was considerable. An early version of his orchestral work Sea Sheen received its first run through by an amateur orchestra in Colne as early as 1917, with the fourteen year old composer conducting. However, two years later he burned most of his early compositions and started again. Despite this, by 30 March 1920 some 25 of his works were ready to be given a hearing at a British Music Society event. By the age of 18 his catalogue numbered some 57 works. Fogg's name first reached a wider audience when he appeared at a Queen's Hall Prom concert on 21 September 1920 to conduct his Golden Butterfly ballet suite, op 40. On 16 June 1921, his \\"Chinese suite\\" The Golden Valley (1919) was premiered by Adrian Boult with the Queen's Hall Orchestra at the Royal College of Music, in the same concert as the first and only performance of Ivor Gurney's War Elegy. He joined the BBC in Manchester in 1924 as an accompanist, rising to assistant music director under T H Morrison. In the 1930s he was well known as \\"Uncle Eric\\" of the radio programme Children's Favourites. He succeeded Archie Camden as the conductor of the Manchester Schoolchildren’s Orchestra. In 1934 he moved to London and became musical director of the BBC's Empire Service (now the BBC World Service), where he founded the Empire Orchestra of 22 players in December 1934. After this time his composition work tailed off due to pressure of other work, which included conducting the Empire Orchestra five times a week, mostly in the early mornings and late at night. In 1935 he conducted the orchestra in the first performance of Peggy Glanville-Hicks's Sinfonietta in D minor for small orchestra.S. Robinson, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, Composer and Critic (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2019. Death Eric Fogg died on 19 December 1939, when he either fell or jumped under the wheels of a train at Waterloo Station in London. He had been on his way to Brighton for his second wedding. The coroner delivered an open verdict, however his death is often described as suicide. Music Fogg's music attracted differing opinions and even some hostility during his lifetime. Some critics felt that he was too modernistic, but others complained that he did not wholeheartedly encompass modernism. It soon fell from the repertoire, but of recent years his music has started to be performed once more, and recorded. * Sea Sheen: An Idyll, Op. 17 (1920), was written before his study with Granville Bantock. It is possible that it is the same as the Idyll heard at Bournemouth on 24 March 1919. It exists in both piano and orchestral versions, the latter recorded by the BBC Midland Light Orchestra conducted by Gilbert Vinter, and more recently by the BBC Concert Orchestra under Gavin Sutherland. * The tone poem Merok (1929), in the form of variations on a Norwegian folk song, refers to a village in Western Norway at the head of the Geiranger Fjord. It was recorded for the first time by the BBC Concert Orchestra under Vernon Handley. A new recording by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Rumon Gamba, was issued by Chandos Records in September 2019. Gamba describes the work as showing \\"restrained beauty and a certain melancholy by using shifting, unexpected harmonies and constantly altering the placement of the melody within the orchestra - most hauntingly at the end where the bass clarinet disappears into the misty fjord...\\" * The original score for the choral and orchestral work The Seasons (words by William Blake) was either lost or destroyed. It was premiered at the Leeds Festival in 1931, in the same concert as the premiere of William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast. To celebrate the centenary of Fogg’s birth, a new score was prepared, and the work was performed by the Broadheath Singers and the Windsor Sinfonia conducted by Garry Humphreys at St Mary's Parish Church, Slough, on 13 September 2003. It received another performance on 25 March 2006, with the BBC Philharmonic and the Leeds Festival Chorus under Simon Wright, which was (apparently erroneously) described as \\"the first performance in 75 years\\". A non-commercial recording exists. * The Bassoon Concerto in D (1931), written for Archie Camden and premiered by him with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer on 20 August 1931 at the Queen's Hall was recorded by Graham Salvage with the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland in 2001. It is the most substantial orchestral score of his to have survived.

The GCV was organized under the Follow On Incremental Capabilities Package of the BCT Modernization program. The first variant of the vehicle was to be prototyped in 2015 and fielded by 2017. It replaced the canceled Future Combat Systems, manned ground vehicles program. The Ground Combat Vehicle program was cancelled in February 2014. Its replacement was Next generation combat vehicle.US Army, Marines Struggle With Infantry Vehicle Replacements - Defensenews.com, 6 April 2014 Design Specific design elements of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former FCS manned ground vehicles program where contractors had more control over the design. The GCV was to be networked and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and power management functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested contractors to be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be built around a common chassis. Network The GCV was planned to be networked. The GCV was to be operable with the current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state- of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system would be capable of integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers. Mobility The GCV must have been transportable by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by the dimensions of the C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30 mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.. In its standard configuration the IFV would have a crew of three and carry a squad of nine. The vehicle could be reconfigured to support casualty evacuation. The Army stated no preference as to whether the IFV should be tracked or wheeled but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements. Offensive capabilities The Army wanted the vehicle to feature a commander's weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an anti-tank guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate a shield. Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments. In May 2012, the Army's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM MAS) began to emphasize the need for munitions suppliers to begin readying for GCV IFV ammunition needs. Solutions ranged from 25 mm to 50 mm, but 30x173mm was identified as \\"the most likely\\" design to meet lethality and stowed kill requirements. Specific requirements were for airburst capability to defeat infantry targets (with high explosive incendiary recognized as a \\"less effective alternative\\"), armor-piercing rounds to defeat material threats, and training ammunition for each tactical round. Potential candidates included five U.S. produced and three foreign-made rounds. On 7 August 2013, a sources sought announcement was made for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for 30x173 mm ammunition: 2,700 rounds of Mk 238 Mod 1 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer (HEI-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 258 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 268 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); and 2,000 rounds of Mk 317 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer (TPDS-T). The announcement called for the cartridges to be compatible with the Bushmaster III weapon system, such as XM813 and/or Mk 44 Mod 1. All interested participants had to provide the ammo quantities and associated information before the end of March 2015.Army Refines 30mm Ammunition Efforts for GCV - Defensemedianetwork.com, 18 August 2013 Countermeasures The Army wanted the GCV to have a passive blast protection level equal to the MRAP and would utilize hit avoidance systems.

In June 2009, a blue-ribbon panel met in Washington, D.C., to discuss requirements for the Ground Combat Vehicle. In October and November 2009, more than 100 defense contractors turned up for two U.S. Army-organized industry day events in Michigan to express interest in bidding on the vehicle. A review required for continuation was held and passed in February 2010 in Washington D.C. A request for proposals (RFP) was issued on 25 February 2010 to which companies had 60 days to respond, but was extended an additional 25 days. A committee examined the schedule for the GCV to \\"shave a little time off\\". For fiscal year 2011, the U.S. Army wished to spend $934 million of the $2.5 billion allocated for BCT Modernization to develop the GCV. Up to three competitive contracts were to be awarded by early fall. A prototype development contract decision would have followed by 2013. The Technology Development Phase (or Milestone A) would begin in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2010 with the award of up to three vehicle contracts. This was to be followed by an Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase before full production could start. Nine vehicles were evaluated in the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). The four primary vehicles included in the AOA were the M2A3 Bradley II, a modernized Stryker, an M2A3 Bradley variant used in Iraq, and a XM1230 Caiman Plus MRAP. The five secondary vehicles included two unnamed foreign- made platforms, the M1126 Stryker Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M1A2 SEP TUSK Abrams, and a modernized M1 Abrams. Vehicles included the AOA were determined to be inferior to the planned GCV. On 25 August 2010, the U.S. Army canceled the original RFP to revise the requirements. A new RFP was to be issued 60 days later. When Peter Chiarelli was asked if the Army was developing an alternative to the GCV, Chiarelli replied \\"We're totally committed to GCV.\\" The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested deferring development of the GCV until after 2015. In August 2011, technology development contracts were awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments for $449.9 million and General Dynamics Land Systems for $439.7M. Budget concerns and proposed cuts In December 2012, it was reported that the Army may need to cut $150 million from the GCV program in 2014, with deeper cuts between $600–700 million between 2014 and 2018. This put the program, one of the Army's highest priorities, at serious risk. With the drawdown of the War in Afghanistan and budgetary concerns, the expensive development of a new combat vehicle was not seen as feasible. BAE Systems and General Dynamics were each awarded engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase contracts in August 2011. The EMD phase was to last 48 months for both contractors, but there were arguments for only one to proceed as a cost-saving measure. This would present the problem of selecting a vehicle based on design outlines, rather than on real prototypes. Another suggestion was to lengthen the EMD period to allow for smaller contract awards over time. This might delay the operational deadline beyond the planned 2018 date. The underlying concern is the fact that the Army plans to spend 80 percent of its ground combat vehicle budget on GCV development from 2013-2018. With 1,847 GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicles expected to be acquired, they would make up only 10 percent of the Army combat vehicle fleet. Redirected funds could be shifted to modernization efforts for the combat-proven Stryker, M1 Abrams, and Bradley families of vehicles.\\"Massive GCV Cuts On The Table As Army 'Reviews' Program\\" . Insidedefense.com, 5 December 2012. Revision The GCV acquisition strategy was revised on 17 January 2013 to further reduce risk and maintain affordability of the program. The revision extended the technology development phase by six months to give industry more time to refine vehicle designs. Milestone B would occur in 2014, with the selection of a single vendor for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and production phases of the program. This would initiate critical design and testing activities in anticipation of vehicle production. Budgetary pressures caused the reduction of number of vendors to be selected from two to one. CBO report On 2 April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report on the progress of the GCV program. The report questioned the program, estimated to cost $28 billion from 2014–2030, with the possibility of alternate vehicle options. While none met overall Army goals desired in the GCV, they offered advantages in being less costly and delayed. Planned GCV prototypes were heavy, weighing up to 84 tons, to be better protected and seat a nine-man squad. Officials said that a vehicle of that size would not be well suited to operations faced in Iraq or Afghanistan. Alternate vehicles would be cheaper and more maneuverable in urban settings. The CBO report analyzed four alternative options:Report: GCV is worst choice to replace Bradley – DoDBuzz.com, 3 April 2013The Army’s Ground Combat Vehicle Program and Alternatives – CBO.gov, 2 April 2013 * Purchase the Namer APC – Seats 9 soldiers with combat survival rates expected slightly higher than the GCV, and costs $9 billion less. The Namer has less ability to destroy other enemy vehicles and is less mobile. Production would be conducted in part domestically, but fielding would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments. * Upgrade the Bradley IFV – An upgraded Bradley would be more lethal than the GCV against enemy forces and would probably survive combat at about the same rates as would the GCV, saving $19.8 billion. Upgrading the Bradley would make it \\"significantly more capable\\" than the GCV. The Bradley still only carries a 7-man squad and has less mobility. * Purchase the Puma (IFV) – More lethal than the GCV, combat survival and protection at better rates, and just as mobile. Purchasing the Puma would save $14.8 billion and was considered the most capable of the vehicles. Puma IFVs only carry six infantrymen, which would require five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys. Development and production would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments. * Cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle – If the Army reconditioned its current Bradley instead of replacing them, the current capability of the IFV fleet could be maintained through 2030. The Army could continue to investigate ways to improve the current Bradleys, but it would not field any new or improved vehicles. The $24 billion saved in funding could be used on other programs. General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who received contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying they used the wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did not account for the change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25 mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30 mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.Army, industry slam CBO’s scathing GCV report – DoDBuzz.com, 4 April 2013 Funding cut and prioritization On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno warned that the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or possibly even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did not rule out the possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.Odierno: GCV in Danger of Cancelation – Military.com, 30 July 2013\\"Ground Combat Vehicle may be delayed – or canceled\\", Army Times, 5 August 2013 Some reports suggested that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV would be a better buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report suggested that given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.US Army Looks To Delay, Increase Cost of AMPV Program – Defensenews.com, 2 October 2013 Army leaders say having a large ground army is still necessary for deterrence and \\"regime change\\" operations. They also realize that their equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current equipment for the rest of the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.Big Army For Big Wars? Yes! GCV? Probably Not – Breakingdefense.com, 13 November 2013 On 15 January 2014, a spending bill passed by the House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29–34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce the weight of the vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million.US Army's GCV Program Downgraded To Study Project – Defensenews.com, 18 January 2014 The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.GCV's Loss Will Reset Army Buying Priorities – Military.com, 22 January 2014 In a speech on 23 January 2014, General Ray Odierno confirmed that the Ground Combat Vehicle program was being put on hold due to budget difficulties. He said that the Army needed a new IFV but that they could not afford one at the time. Odierno said that he was pleased with the requirements for the vehicle and that progress and development with the contractors was good. \\"Leap-ahead technologies\\" that make the vehicle light and mobile while still being protected against RPGs and roadside bombs are still desired. In the past decade, mobility was traded for protection, but Army war games caused the service to decide it will need small, mobile formations to be deployed quickly in the future, and recent conflicts showed the need for expeditionary forces to be transported quickly to remote areas in small packages with as little support as possible; weight estimates of 70 tons for the GCV IFV did not make it easily deployable. The Army may direct some funds for technology development so it can start another program within \\"three to four years.\\"US Army Chief Confirms: Ground Combat Vehicle Is Dead (For Now) – Defensenews.com, 23 January 2014 Science and technology investments were to be made to address the size and weight of armored ground vehicles to make it easier and cheaper to transport greater numbers of them across the world.\\"Army leaders preview lighter, faster service\\", Military Times, 28 January 2014 Termination The Pentagon FY 2015 budget proposal unveiled on 24 February 2014 cancelled the GCV program.. Army acquisition executive Heidi Shyu said that criticism of the program was \\"unfortunate\\" and cancelling it had nothing to do with vehicle performance. She said the program had been doing \\"remarkably well\\" and wasn't having technical issues, and that the contracts were being executed well. The decision to cancel development was based entirely on budget calculations, with no possible way to come up with funds no matter how many other areas were reduced. Money will be redistributed to engineering change proposals (ECP) on existing platforms until budget difficulties pass to allow investment in next-generation capabilities in about seven years.US Army Official Defends GCV Against 'Attacks' - Defensenews.com, 25 February 2014 The decision had to be made to either exclusively fund the GCV or ECPs, so upgrades were chosen for the Bradley, Abrams, Stryker, and M109 Paladin fleets to have them more combat-capable in the near-term, should they be needed for an international situation. Vehicles like the Bradley and Abrams have been upgraded since the 1980s with new armor, sensors, and other gear that have maxed out the platforms for further horsepower and electrical advances, so the requirement for an entirely new ground combat vehicle built from the outset from lessons learned in combat from the previous decade remains.Shyu Sings The Army Electric: 2015 Budget Sacrifices Weapons For Electronics - Breakingdefense.com, 3 March 2014 The Army's own budget proposal unveiled on 4 March discontinued the program, and instead funds were shifted to the AMPV program as the main vehicle priority and to improving the Bradley IFV in the interim until more resources become available.Army 2015 Budget Kills GCV, Cuts Readiness - DoDBuzz.com, 4 March 2014FY15 Army budget, request includes small pay raise, 490K end strength - Army.mil, 4 March 2014 Incremental improvements will be made to current vehicle fleets to improve protection and networking abilities. $131 million will be directed into science and technology to look at the feasibility of future combat vehicle technologies, and Secretary Hagel has directed the Army, as well as the Marine Corps, to deliver \\"realistic\\" visions for vehicle modernization by the end of FY 2014.Army Budget Makes Force Structure, Modernization Cuts Official - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 4 March 2014 The cancellation of the GCV is the second time in 15 years an Army program to replace the Bradley has failed. FCS ran from 1999 to 2009, with the Manned Ground Vehicles portion for replacing several armored vehicle classes costing \\"hundreds of millions\\" of dollars out of $20 billion total. From 2010 to 2014, the Army spent over $1 billion on the GCV. Although there was criticism that vehicle weight could not be kept at a reasonable level while meeting its size and power requirements, the Army maintains the official reason for the cancellation was budgetary pressures. BAE Systems and General Dynamics will each receive $50 million in FY 2015 to continue technology development. The next follow-up IFV development program is currently named the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV). Continued technology development On 18 July 2014, BAE and General Dynamics were awarded $7.9 million study contracts for technical, cost, and risk assessments to salvage subsystems and other technologies created under the GCV for use in the FFV system. General Dynamics will utilize the GCV integrated propulsion and mobility subsystems Automotive Test Rig (ATR), and the conventional drive integrated propulsion subsystem, while BAE will utilize the GCV TD phase integrated hybrid-electric propulsion and mobility subsystems ATR and the hybrid-electric integrated propulsion subsystem (Hotbuck).Army Attempts to Salvage GCV Technology Advances - Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 July 2014Army asks BAE Systems and General Dynamics to recycle GCV vetronics for Future Fighting Vehicle - Militaryaerospace.com, 18 August 2014 Variants Artist's impression of the GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle The Army was using an incremental approach to combat vehicle modernization, centered on the Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on the rate at which the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm. Infantry Fighting Vehicle The Infantry Fighting Vehicle superseded the previous infantry carrier replacement effort, the XM1206 Infantry Carrier Vehicle of the FCS MGV program. It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC by 2018, the M2 Bradley later, and the Stryker ICV in the midterm. The IFV was to hold a crew of three and a squad of nine.

Schiller was one of the most famous poets in German history. Long believed to be entombed in the Fürstengruft in Weimar, Germany, the location of the writer's skull is now unknown. Death, burial and move to Fürstengruft Schiller on his deathbed – a drawing by the portraitist Ferdinand Jagemann from 1805 Three days after Friedrich Schiller died on May 9, 1805, he was hastily buried in a mausoleum for distinguished citizens whose families did not have a family grave, the Kassengewölbe, in Weimar’s Jacobs cemetery. The burial was quick and unceremonious. There was, as the writer and Nobel Prize laureate Thomas Mann put it in 1955, \\"no mild sound of music, no word from the mouth of priest or friend.\\" Schiller’s widow Charlotte von Lengefeld had planned to move him to an individual grave later.Sautter, Ursula: Schiller Skull Mystery. Time. July 26, 2007; Bones of Contention: DNA Tests Reveal 'Schiller's' Skull Not His. Der Spiegel online. May 5, 2008; Schiller's Skulls. Deutsche Welle; Herwig, Malte: Die vertauschten Köpfe. Der Spiegel. May 5, 2008. However, the cheaply made coffin burst and his remains ended up mixed with those of other people in a mass grave. Twenty-one years later, in 1826, the town's mayor, Karl Leberecht Schwabe, an enthusiast of Schiller's writings, decided to dig up the poet's remains. He hired three day laborers and the cemetery's gravedigger to help. By that time, Schiller’s body was decomposed beyond recognition. Schwabe reported that only smoking prevented him and his men from getting sick, as the stench of decay was so strong. He described the Kassengewölbe as a \\"chaos of decay and rot\\". Though not entirely legally, he unearthed a total of 23 or 27 skulls. Schwabe took them home, placed them all on a table and decided the largest must be Schiller's. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, another famous writer and Schiller’s friend, later secretly took the skull home, where he kept it on a blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar and even wrote a poem about it entitled \\"Lines on Seeing Schiller's Skull\\" (\\"Bei Betrachtung von Schillers Schädel\\"). In the poem, he described the skull as a \\"mysterious vessel\\". The skull, along with the body believed to correspond to it, were then moved to the Weimarer Fürstengruft, Weimar's ducal vault, in 1827, to be joined by Goethe's remains in 1832 as a shrine to German Classicism.Sautter, op. cit.; Deutsche Welle, op. cit.; Herwig, op. cit.; Schillers Schädel wird untersucht. Focus. October 10, 2006; Harding, Luke: Tale of two skulls divides Germany. The Guardian. May 8, 2005. First doubts The authenticity of the skull in the Fürstengruft was first questioned in 1883 by the anatomist Hermann Welcker. He claimed the poet’s death mask and the skull did not match. Although experts agreed with him, laymen were outraged by his claims.Sautter, op. cit.; Deutsche Welle, op. cit. The Fürstengruft In 1911, rumors that Schwabe may have chosen the wrong skull started circulating. This led a group of scientists headed by August von Froriep to reopen the original mass grave and unearth another sixty-three skulls and pick one as Schiller’s. In 1914, it was added to the Fürstengruft in an unmarked, inconspicuous, greyish-brown coffin to the side of the one containing the original skull.Harding, op. cit.; Herwig, op. cit. During World War II, both Schiller’s and Goethe’s remains were moved to an underground bunker to protect them from Allied air raids. After the war, the Allies moved them back to Weimar. A decade later, East German scientists opened the sarcophagus once again and concluded that the first skull did belong to the writer after all.Herwig, op. cit. Friedrich Schiller Code Bust of Luise von Göchhausen At first resisting the idea,Deutsche Welle, op. cit. the Foundation of Weimar Classics, which oversees the Schiller archives and exhibitions,Rising, David: DNA puzzler at poet's tomb: No poet!. NBC News. May 4, 2008. finally allowed scientists to analyze the skulls’ DNA to reveal which is Schiller’s in 2006, shortly before celebrations of the 200th anniversary of his death. Dubbed \\"The Friedrich Schiller Code\\", the study was sponsored by the foundation and the television station MDR. It was undertaken by an international team of scientists from the Universities of Freiburg, Jena, and Innsbruck, and others, led by Ursula Wittwer-Backofen. Among them were the scientists who identified Mozart’s skull, Ötzi the Iceman’s skeleton, and victims of the 2004 tsunami in Asia. The Foundation expected to prove that they did, in fact, possess the poet's remains.Rising, op. cit.; Geheimnis um Schiller-Schädel entschlüsselt: DNA-Analysen widerlegen Echtheit. scinexx. May 7, 2008. First, anthropologists created forensic facial reconstructions of both skulls. The original skull recovered in 1826 matched portraits of the poet almost perfectly. The size and both two- and three-dimensional facial reconstructions matched the death mask. It was indeed extraordinarily large; only 1.5% of the population has a skull of this size and Schiller was also said to be tall. An analysis of the cementum of the teeth of the skull indicated an age of 39 to 52 at death, Schiller having died aged 45. All of this clearly indicated that the skull must indeed be Schiller's and those involved were reasonably sure it was. The skull from 1911, on the other hand, was exposed as a fake and later identified as belonging to Luise von Göchhausen, Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel’s first Court Lady, whom Schiller knew and disliked. Scientists also took DNA samples from the bones, both the skull and the skeleton, in the casket on July 14, 2006. They were compared to samples from the teeth and thigh bones of Schiller’s relatives, both of his second son, Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm, and the poet's wife, Charlotte von Lengefeld, who were exhumed from Bonn’s Old Cemetery, since there are no direct descendants still alive. To much surprise, it was announced in 2008 that both the Institute of Legal Medicine in Innsbruck and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in Rockville, Maryland had concluded that the DNA did not match. In fact, the two skeletons together were shown to contain bones belonging to a total of six different people, but none of them to Schiller.scinexx, op. cit.; Herwig, op. cit.; Kulish, Nicholas: Two more skulls, but still no Schiller. New York Times. May 8, 2008. Explanations of the disappearance Franz Joseph Gall There are several theories as to how Schiller’s skull may have been lost. The anatomist Franz Joseph Gall is one; a notorious collector of skulls who believed it to be possible to determine a person’s character by the characteristics of their skull, he traveled to Weimar shortly after the poet’s death. Another is Ludwig Friedrich von Froriep, also an anatomist as well as the grandfather of August von Froriep, who unearthed the second skull in 1911. He could have stolen the skull from the Fürstengruft and then replaced it with one from his sizable collection.Rätsel um Schillers Schädel-Double. Der Spiegel. May 4, 2008. Another possibility raised by Ralf Jahn, a historian on the team of investigators, and others is that Schiller's remains were stolen by grave- robbers in the 19th century.Smee, Jess: DNA tests end debate over Schiller skulls: neither is his. The Guardian. May 5, 2008. The Foundation of Weimar Classics has announced it would not search for Friedrich Schiller's actual skull. According to Hellmut Seemann, the foundation's president, \\"for us the Schiller skull dispute is over. We only had to answer the question of whether either of the two skulls in the Fürstengruft was Schiller's or not.\\" He added that \\"searching European anthropological collections for Schiller's skull is not the Classics Foundation's task.\\"Schillers Schädel: Weimar sucht nicht weiter.

In May 2015 Turn2us was integrated with former parent charity Elizabeth Finn Care with both brands coming under the Turn2us banner. Turn2us is now the trading name for Elizabeth Finn Care, it is registered in England and Wales: 207812 and Scotland: SC040987. Aims Over 14 million people currently live in poverty in the UK, including 4.5 million children. Turn2us was set up to respond to this need. The charity has five objectives that were published in their 2014/15 Annual Report: * To distribute direct grants for a series of trusts and funds managed directly by the charity * To provide a comprehensive set of channels and resources to help people struggling to gain access to welfare benefits, charitable grants and other support services * To provide a focal point for grant giving and for other financially related not-for-profit organisations to tackle poverty * To raise awareness of practical help available to people struggling financially * To run our affairs in a professional and financially sustainable manner Campaigns The charity holds a number of regular campaigns aimed at raising awareness of issues relating to poverty and raising funds for charitable activity. In 2014 the fuel poverty campaign was supported by a number of politicians including Brooks Newmark, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey, Cheryl Gillan and Dan Jarvis. In 2015 the Independent newspaper reported \\"The charity is launching a new \\"Cut out the Cold\\" campaign to highlight the help that struggling people can get with energy costs. Its research suggests that seven out of 10 families have never heard of the Warm Home Discount scheme, for instance, which hands hard-up folk a £140 discount on their electricity bill. The research also reveals that half of hard-up families have not checked their eligibility for benefits while almost nine out of 10 have not checked what free charitable grants may exist. We need to see more done to help raise awareness of the financial support and help available to manage energy bills,\\" said Alison Taylor. \\"It is vital that people on low incomes are not left behind.” In November 2015 the charity launched its No Cold Homes campaign to raise awareness of those struggling to afford to heat their homes. The campaign drew support from a range of high-profile celebrities who donated winter items to raise money for the charity. Oscar- winning actress Helen Mirren, who donated to the campaign, commenting, \\"I'm pleased to play a part in helping more families get the vital help they need this winter.\\" In 2016 the charity released new research as part of the No Cold Homes campaigns highlighting the extent to which people are unaware of the support that is available. In response to the findings Turn2us brought together representatives of the 'big six' energy companies to discuss the problem, which attracted broad media coverage.https://news.sky.com/story/big- six-energy-companies-to-meet-over-fuel-poverty-10685013 In 2017 the charity launched a new campaign, #LivingWithout. The campaign draws attention to the scale and consequences of living without basic household appliances such as fridges, freezers, ovens and washing machines. Integration with Elizabeth Finn Care On 1 October 2009 Elizabeth Finn Care and Turn2us legally joined together to form a single charity, to more effectively help the 14 million people currently living in poverty in the UK. At the time of the reintegration it was decided that the two parts of the newly formed charity would preserve their separate identities. In 2014 the charity embarked on a project to look into the impact of coming under one brand. As a result of the consultation it was announced that Elizabeth Finn Care and Turn2us were to become Turn2us. On 18 May 2015 the charity formally came under the Turn2us name and a new logo and strap-line were produced to reflect the changes. Services and activities When the charity began operating under the Turn2us brand in May 2015, it consolidated the charitable activity of Turn2us, Elizabeth Finn Care and Elizabeth Finn Grants under one name. Elizabeth Finn Homes Limited was not impacted by the reintegration and remains a separate brand. The largest activity as a proportion of charitable expenditure is direct grant giving. In 2017/18 the charity gave £4 million to over 3,859 individuals.https://www.turn2us.org.uk/getattachment/About-Us/What-we- do/Annual-Review-2013-14.pdf The other main area of charitable activity is through raising awareness of financial support through the charity website turn2us.org.uk The charity's Annual Report claims that in 2017/18 almost 7 million people used the website. Website The Turn2us website is designed to help people find appropriate sources of financial support, quickly and easily, based on their particular needs and circumstances.

A. Richards in 1951. It reflects the impact of Management cybernetics in the general area of management studies. It refers to the practice of giving a control impact in a downlink to a subordinate to a person or an organization from which you are expecting an output. A feed forward is not just a pre-feedback, as a feedback is always based on measuring an output and sending respective feedback. A pre-feedback given without measurement of output may be understood as a confirmation or just an acknowledgment of control command. However, a feed forward is generally imposed before any willful change in output may occur. All other changes of output determined with feedback may for example result from distortion, noise or attenuation. It usually involves giving a document for review and giving an ex post information on that document which you have not already given. However, social feedback is the response of the supreme hierarch to the subordinate as an acknowledgement of a subordinate's report on output, hence the subordinate's feedback to the supreme. Origin of term Feedforward as a management term has been used by Avraham Kluger since 2006 and Marshall Goldsmith in one of his prominent management articles.

He was the Commandant of the Neumünde redoubt/fortlet (skans in Swedish). Biography Joachim Cronman was the son of Hans Detterman Cronman (1590–c1645) and was born around 1640. Hans was the war commissar for the Swedish Empire. Hans had been knighted as Lord Cronman by Christina, Queen of Sweden on March 9, 1638. He became Lord of Alatskivi Castle in Swedish Livonia in 1642.Genealogisches Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften, Teil 2 Estland, Bd. 3, Görlitz, 1930, s.19 Joachim's mother was Ursula Kordes (1600–1675), and she was the daughter of Joakim Kordes and Ursula Gantschau.Gabriel Anrep lists his siblings as: Johan Detterman Cronman (1618–?); Vilhelm Cronman (c.1617–1656); Anna Catharine Cronman I (1620–?) who married Colonel Frans von Knorring (1626–1694); Christina Cronman (c1625–1687) who married Joakim George Fredrick von Rohr (c1625–1687) and he died in the Battle of Narva; Elisabeth Cronman (1630–1687); and Fritz Cronman (c1640–?) who was a diplomat.

She would be the sister of Joachim Cronman. Gustaf Elgenstierna corrected the Anrep genealogy around 1925. He has an Anna Catharina Cronman II (c1660–1661) who died young, and Anna Catharina Cronman III as the wife of Hans Christoffer von Rohr I (1626–1700). This makes her the daughter of Joachim Cronman, which puts her at the proper age for bearing the children of von Rohr. Hans would be about 30 years older than her.

Biography Early life Wilkinson was born in Croydon, Surrey, UK, in 1961, from a working-class background. By the time he was 12 years old he had his own private laboratory and still does to this day. He was inspired and encouraged by Dr Phillips, a gifted science teacher at Stanley Technical High School, to pursue his dream of becoming a chemist when he demonstrated that he knew the answers to \\"A level\\" chemistry exams and above despite being only 14 years of age. He was also inspired by a chemistry teacher, Mr Neil Miller at Croydon College, and then went on to study Chemistry – by – thesis at Sussex University where he undertook a three-year research programme, remarkably as an undergraduate, on the chemistry of bioluminescence under the supervision of Professor Frank McCapra. From 1985 to 1987, Wilkinson worked for Wellcome Research Laboratories and Beecham in the area of drug discovery. He was one of the first graduate scientists to be given 20% of his work time to develop his own research ideas. Wilkinson was awarded a Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Instant award which was then later funded by ICI and obtained his PhD from Imperial College London (1987–1990) working with Professor William Motherwell. Wilkinson was then awarded the prestigious SERC-NATO post- doctoral fellowship to work with the Nobel Prize–winning Professor George Olah in Los Angeles, California, (1991–1992), where he worked on, among other things, natural products chemistry, organic chemistry and Buckminsterfullerenes. Following his post-doctoral work in the United States, Wilkinson returned to the UK and became a visiting Research Fellow in Phytochemistry at the University of Exeter in 1993, with Professor Stan Roberts, and was also a visiting lecturer at The School of Phytotherapy in East Sussex with the eminent medical herbalist and scientist, Hein Zeylstra (1928–2001). He was also an academic as senior lecturer in phytochemistry and pharmacognosy from 1994 - 2004 developing a new academic discipline and evolving over that time to become an independent scientist. He continues to do research, teaching and act as an adviser on an international basis to universities and companies around the World. Herbal medicine and Middlesex University In 1994, Wilkinson programme led the first herbal medicine degree course in Europe, from its beginnings in 1994 at Middlesex University.Totnes man leads the first degree course in herbal medicine, Totnes News, No. 388, 2 September 1994 \\\\- \\"Unleashing Plant Power\\", Times Higher Educational Supplement, 9 January 1998 He was also appointed as a senior lecturer in phytochemistry and pharmacognosy, where he remained until 2004. During his tenure at Middlesex University, Wilkinson founded the Herbal Research Laboratories in 1996. He became Head of the Phytochemistry Discovery Group and led a team of 10 post- doctoral scientists, research assistants and other staff members. He was also a guest lecturer at Oxford University Medical School where he taught medical undergraduates the scientific aspects of herbal medicines. He began a natural product research and regulatory consultancy company in 2001. Despite leaving Middlesex University in 2004, he ran the company until 2012, while undertaking research as an independent scientist. He then established \\"Dr John Wilkinson Consultancy\\" as a business and also a vehicle for conducting and funding research as an independent scientist. His research funded by individuals, companies and through \\"crowd funding\\" focuses on several areas: Research on molecular synergy effects in botanical extracts, herbal medicines and essential oils (the latter with reference to their use in improvements and maintenance of memory functioning): Biochemical ecology - synergism in nature; New exotic fruits and their unique nutritional properties. Dr Wilkinson obtained the first novel food approval in the European Union for a nutraceutical based on a safe history of use rather than conventional toxicological studies. This approval effectively broke the trade barriers and opened the European Union to new fruits, vegetables and nutraceuticals from developing countries. Dr Wilkinson continues to work in the area of regulatory approval for health claims on food labels, novel foods, herbal medicines and food supplements in the EU, the US and elsewhere. Other achievements Wilkinson has been approached by TV, radio and newspapers for interviews and opinions concerning these types of food and medicinal based products. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- Wilkinson has published a number of articles during his academic career presented at conferences and trade shows related to natural products.Wilkinson, J.A.

In 2003, Prudential Securities was merged into Wachovia Securities, a division of Wachovia Bank.Prudential, Wachovia Complete Corporate Merger The State Journal, July 18, 2003 History Prudential Securities traces its origins to the founding of the Leopold Cahn & Co. brokerage and investment bank in 1879. In 1891, the firm was reorganized as J.S. Bache & Co. after Jules Bache was brought into the partnership. In 1974, Bache merged with Halsey, Stuart & Co., a Chicago-based investment bank founded in 1911. In 1952, Halsey, Stuart made headlines when its managing partner, Harold L. Stuart, testified before the U.S. Supreme Court for the government's antitrust case against Morgan Stanley and 16 other major investment banks. The fact that Halsey, Stuart was a significant investment banking firm, at the top of the IPO league tables in 1951 led some observers to suspect that they had provoked the government's antitrust suit.Time Magazine, Nothing Short of Criminal, Mar. 17, 1952.Ron Chernow, The House of Morgan, (Touchstone Books, 1990), pp. 502-503. Prudential-Bache logo, ca. 1984 In 1981, the company (then called Bache Halsey Stuart Shields) was acquired by Prudential Financial and renamed Prudential-Bache Securities. Prudential dropped the usage of the Bache name in 1991, renaming the division Prudential Securities. In 1989, the firm acquired branch offices, client accounts and related assets from Thomson McKinnon when a deal to purchase Thompson McKinnon fell through Thomson McKinnon Said to Be in Sale Talks. New York Times, June 9, 1989 a top 20 brokerage and investment banking firm. Investor fraud During the 1980s and 1990s, Prudential Securities Incorporated, was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for suspected fraud. During the investigation, it was found that PSI had defrauded investors of close to $8 billion, the largest fraud found by the SEC in US history to that point. The SEC charged that Prudential allowed rogue executives to cheat customers on a large scale and blithely ignored a 1986 SEC order to overhaul its internal enforcement of securities laws. In all, some 400,000 individual investors lost money on the deals. Prudential Financial eventually settled with investors for $330 million in 1993. Prudential said it would repay customers across the U.S. who lost money on the company's limited partnerships in the 1980s. In addition, the firm was required to pay another $41 million in fines. The settlement also resolved investigations of the firm by the National Association of Securities Dealers and 49 states, including California, where 52,000 investors lost money in Prudential limited partnerships. Further investigation was conducted by the SEC into the executives of the company to determine the extent of the fraud. Merger with Wachovia Prudential Financial combined its retail brokerage in a joint venture with Wachovia to form Wachovia Securities LLC on July 1, 2003. Wachovia purchased 62% of the joint venture, while Prudential retained the remaining 38%. At the time, the new firm had client assets of $532.1 billion, making it the nation's third largest full service retail brokerage firm based on assets. Prudential, which had been looking to sell its brokerage division, sought to use the joint venture's larger brokerage network to market its insurance products, while Wachovia sought to expand its investment banking business through the combination.Prudential and Wachovia Said to Be Near Merging Units. New York Times, February 10, 2003 Remaining Business Following the joint venture with Wachovia, Prudential Financial retained the commodities and financial derivatives businesses.

He left the city after a few months. Four decades later, in 1642, the VOC and the WIC sent a fleet of ships to Chile to take control of Valdivia and its Spanish gold mines. The expedition was conducted by Hendrik Brouwer, a Dutch general. In 1643 Brouwer conquered the Chiloé Archipelago and Valdivia. After Brouwer died on 7 August 1643, vice-general Elias Herckmans took control. (The New Flanders Colony). Dutch colonization in Chile The second emigration from the Netherlands to Chile occurred in 1895. A dozen Dutch families settled in Chile between 1895 and 1897, particularly in Mechaico, Huillinco and Chacao. Egbert Hageman arrived in Chile with his family, on 14 April 1896, settling in Rio Gato, near Puerto Montt. The Wennekool family inaugurated the Dutch colonization of Villarrica. In the early twentieth century, a large group of Dutch people arrived in Chile from South Africa. These migrants, after a long stay in African camps, were presented with the opportunity to emigrate to Chile with the help of the Chilean government. On 4 May 1903, a group of over 200 Dutch sailed on the steamship \\"Oropesa\\" owned by the shipping company \\"Pacific Steam Navigation Company\\", from La Rochelle (La Pallice) in France. The majority had been born in the Netherlands (35% from North Holland and South Holland, 13% from North Brabant, 9% from Zeeland and an equal number of Gelderland). Only a dozen children had been born in South Africa. On June 5, the arrived by train to the city of Pitrufquén. Another group of Dutchmen arrived shortly after to Talcahuano, in the \\"Oravi\\" and the \\"Orissa\\". The Netherlands colony in Donguil was christened \\"New Transvaal Colony\\". More than 500 Dutch families moved there. The last group of Boers arrived between 7 February 1907 and February 18, 1909.

On November 1, 1959, after passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, it came under the newly created US Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). Its purpose was to conduct research and development on air traffic control computers, transponders, and advanced radar equipment. The success (in terms of funding and research activity) eventually forced the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to close its own Technical Evaluation and Development Center in Indianapolis starting in 1959. The computerized air traffic control developed at NAFEC was based on the IBM 9020, special hardware developed by IBM. Software was developed by NAFEC, IBM, and under contract to Computer Usage Company. The system remained in operation until the 1980s. The former 1942 Naval Air Station became the Atlantic City International Airport, and the center is now called the William J. Hughes Technical Center, named for William J. Hughes. Since 1958, the center's core activities were accelerating programs to improve aviation safety and updating the air traffic control system, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) being a part of it. Besides the research and development project work, the FAA field facilities have daily operational support all over the country from the center operating 24-hour.

Pulpulaks were and are often used by people to appoint meetings and by couples as dating locations.  Name  The word pulpulak is colloquial and derives from the sound of the murmuring of water \\"pul-pul\\", suffixed with \\"ak\\" (ակ), meaning \\"water source\\". They are rarely referred to as tsaytaghbyur (), meaning \\"squirt spring\\".  Description  Pulpulaks are small, usually one meter tall, stone memorials with running water, often fed by a mountain spring. Some pulpulaks are erected in memory of dead relatives. In drinking from a memorial pulpulak, passers by give their blessing to the person in memory of whom it is constructed. Memorial pulpulaks are related to khatchkars. Yotnaghbyur Yotnaghbyur (Յոթնաղբյուր, meaning \\"seven springs\\") is the name of the famous pupulak in Armenian capital Yerevan's Republic Square. It was erected by Spartak Gndeghtsyan in 1965. The fountain was restored in 2008 by Moscow-based Armenian designer Nur.

Monument to \\"Chilean Race\\", Nicolás Palacios. Nicolás Palacios Navarro (September 9, 1854 – June 11, 1931) was a Chilean physician and writer born in Santa Cruz, best known for his writings on the \\"Chilean race\\" and national identity. His uncopyrighted 1904 (second edition 1918) book Raza chilena form the ideological backbone of many Chilean Nazi groups. Palacios witnessed the Santa María School massacre of 1907 writing a key account of it. The Chilean Race Palacios identifies what is typically Chilean with the figure of the roto and a supposed Chilean race. He elevates the Chilean mestizo in status since, according to his writings, the Chilean is a mix of two bellicose master races: the Visigoths of Spain and the Mapuche of Chile. Palacios traces the origins of the Spanish component of the \\"Chilean race\\" () to the coast of the Baltic Sea, specifically to Götaland in Sweden, one of the supposed homelands of the Goths.Raza Chilena Nicolás Palacios He says that at most 10% of the Visigoths mixed with the native Iberians of Spain, while the rest remained racially pure through the Middle Ages. The conquest of Chile and the War of Arauco that followed for many years attracted adventurous Spaniards of martial lineage to Chile, thus giving Chile an overwhelming amount of Visigoth heritage and blood, in contrast to other more prosperous Spanish colonies where \\"merchant peoples\\" dominated. These Spaniards of supposed Visigoth ancestry would have mingled with native Mapuches, producing the common Chilean roto. According to Palacios about 25,000 Goths arrived to Chile during the first five generations after its initial conquest in the 1540s and 1550s. Palacios goes on to say that both the blond and the bronze-coloured Chilean mestizo share a \\"moral physiognomy\\", and that both think and reason in the same way, a similarity that can be found in early Spanish literature about Chile including the epic poem La Araucana, where Mapuches are frequently compared to the \\"barbaric\\" Germanic tribes that fought the Roman Empire. He says that the \\"Chilean roto\\" has nothing \\"Latin\\" except the language and the surname, rather than being racially a \\"Latin\\". Palacios finds in alcoholism also a similarity with the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe. Palacios warns against immigration from Southern Europe and says that on medical grounds mestizos descended from Southern Europeans lack \\"cerebral control\\", and are thus a social burden. He adds that the Latin race cannot produce a \\"Miguel Cervantes\\" or \\"Michelangelo\\" in Chile or elsewhere, because the Latin race in the 20th century is very different from that in the Renaissance.

History David Gilmour, Kate Bush, Nick Harper and Nigel Mazlyn Jones appear on the album, with both Gilmour and Bush on the title track.  Songs   The Black Cloud of Islam  The track \\"The Black Cloud of Islam\\" is a despairing castigation of radical Islam. The song provoked some criticism, to which Harper responded, in 2006, when he wrote: \\"I let my guard slip. I knew that I’d let it slip. I wanted it to slip. I was absolutely sick of being politically correct. I am not politically correct, I never have been..\\". His stated reason for penning the song was his \\"feelings of despair\\" about his \\"worst dreams coming true\\" about religion gaining ground. Religion, he stated on his personal blog, was something he regarded with the \\"deepest possible suspicion\\" and now, to his horror, he could see it \\"about to storm the world\\" and \\"take over whole swathes of humanity\\"; a thought that he detested and made him \\"want to die on the spot\\". In a later interview with The Daily Telegraph, the matter of this song was raised. Harper asserted that he wrote the song \\"as a liberal, not as a racist\\" and was inspired to do so by the 1988 Lockerbie Bombing.  Berliners  The opening verse of \\"Berliners\\" is the 4th stanza of Laurence Binyon's \\"Ode of Remembrance\\", and is preceding by a recording of a Remembrance Day ceremony where the same stanza was recited. The song also uses a BBC news broadcast describing the fall of the Berlin Wall. Video Harper supported the release of the album by touring the UK. One of the concerts took place at the Dominion Theatre (a West End theatre on Tottenham Court Road in the London Borough of Camden) and was filmed. The concert took place on 22 November 1990, the same night Margaret Thatcher announced her resignation as Prime Minister which Harper referenced closing the concert by stating \\"...it's been a day to remember on many levels, it can only get better...if you can spoke the wheel of the present authority, then do it as quickly as possible, we need a change...\\".

I was really traumatised by that. Anybody who’s been suddenly left like that will know it’s very, very traumatic. I managed to come out of it, but it took about five years.

Their album, Fuchsia, was listed as one of Mojo magazine's \\"Forgotten Classics\\".\\"Forgotten Classics\\", Mojo, issue 136, March 2005 Their style was similar to their contemporaries Jade and Comus. Formation The band was formed by Tony Durant (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, lead vocals) while a student at Exeter University with Michael Day (bass guitar), Michael Gregory (drums, percussion). The trio was soon augmented by Janet Rogers (violin, backing vocals), Madeleine Bland (cello, piano, harmonium, backing vocals) and Vanessa Hall-Smith (violin, backing vocals) so that Durant could explore his musical ideas. Produced by David Hitchcock, their album was recorded at Sound Techniques Studios by Vic Gamm. It was released by Pegasus (PEG 8) in the UK and by Kingdom (KV 6002) in France. A single advertisement in the Melody Maker and their manager's failure to arrange an often promised tour resulted in minimal sales and the demise of the band. Durant went to work in Australia with Dave Warner and later learned of the popularity of the album amongst collectors and the unlicensed re- pressings. Using his original master tapes he digitally remastered the album at Sound Practices Studios in Sydney which was released on CD (Night Wing NWRCD 02). Recent activity In 2005, the CD Fuchsia, Mahagonny & other gems (Night Wing NWRCD 04) was released. This contained three further Fuchsia tracks, two recorded while looking for a new record company after the first album, and the third an original demonstration acetate recording.CD booklet with album Fuchsia, Mahagonny and other gems Another eight tracks from other projects including Mahagonny, a theatre show based on the works of Bertoldt Brecht and Kurt Weill, completed the album. In 2013, the CD album From Psychedelia... To a Distant Place (Sound Practices 001) was released under the name Fuchsia II with a new band assembled by Durant in Australia and comprising Durant himself (guitars and vocals), Lloyd Gyi (drums, percussion), Emily Duffill (cello), Tracy Wan (violin), Lidia Bara (violin) and Jo Bara (cello), with Suzy Toomey (accordion) and Isabel Durant (backing vocals). The album gained favourable reviews in the British music press Record Collector magazine, June 2013, and Uncut magazine, July 2013. The album contained mostly new material, although the track \\"The Rainbow Song\\" included a re-working of \\"Shoes and Ships\\" from the first album recorded forty-two years previously. Also in 2013, the single \\"The Band\\" was released. This song was written for a second album that was never recorded before Fuchsia disbanded in the 1970s. In the 2013 release, \\"The Band\\" is performed by the Swedish band Me and My Kites (named after a song on Fuchsia's first album) with Durant on vocals.\\"Me and My Kites with Tony Durant of Fuchsia\\", Exposé Online \\\\- Me and My Kites, with Tony Durant from Fuchsia, Fruits de Mer Records In August 2017, a Fuchsia line-up including Durant and Day began a short British tour in Cardigan, Wales, to coincide with the release of the Song double EP, and it was announced that a Fuchsia III album was in preparation.

It was launched by the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 2 (H-IIB F2) manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and JAXA. After the supplies were unloaded, Kounotori 2 was loaded with waste material from ISS, including used experiment equipment and used clothes. Kounotori 2 was then unberthed and separated from the ISS and burned up upon reentering the atmosphere on 30 March 2011.  Specifications Kounotori 2 is across and about long. It consists primarily of three parts: a Propulsion Module, an Avionics Module, and a Logistics Carrier. The propulsion module is installed at the rear of the Kounotori and is composed of the main engines for orbit change, the reaction control system (RCS) thrusters for positioning and attitude control, fuel and oxidizing reagent tanks, and high-pressure air tanks. The avionics module is installed in the center part of Kounotori, with electronic equipment for guidance control, power supply, and telecommunications data processing. The logistics carrier stores supplies.  Cargo items  Kounotori 2 carried of cargo to ISS, consisting of in the Pressurized Logistics Carrier (PLC) and in the Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC). Cargo in the PLC consists of spare system components (51% of cargo weight), food (24%), science experiment materials (10%), crew commodities (8%), and water (7%) i.e. of water. It included the Kobairo (Gradient Heating Furnace) rack and a Multipurpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR). The Gradient Heating Furnace is a high-temperature electrical furnace that will be used to generate large scale, high-quality crystals from melting materials. The MSPR is a multipurpose rack that will be used for many different functions. The rack consists of three main components – a Work volume, a Work bench, and a Small experiment area. One experiment that is already planned for the Work volume, to be launched on a later flight, is the Aquatic Habitat, which will be used to breed small fish in order to study their responses to microgravity and cosmic radiation. Once Kounotori 2 was berthed to the ISS, both Kobairo and the MSPR were transferred into the Japanese Pressurized Module. The installation and commissioning of these racks will initiate the 2nd phase of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) utilization. Kounotori 2's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) carried an EP (Exposed Pallet) with two U.S. ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) attached: an FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) and CTC-4 (Cargo Transportation Container-4). Both the FHRC and CTC-4 were transferred from Kounotori 2's EP to the space station's ELC-4 using the ISS's manipulator \\"Dextre\\".

Scheduling of Kounotori 2 operation was affected by the Space Shuttle mission STS-133. STS-133 was originally planned to be launched in September 2010, well before Kounotori 2. After several delays, eventually, STS-133 was scheduled for February 2011. Since Kounotori 2 needed to depart the ISS after the Space Shuttle to carry away the wastes from the Shuttle's cargo, Kounotori 2's schedule was changed to stay attached to the ISS for two months, close to its design limit, from the initial plan of 40 days. Also, the Dextre robot hand had to keep holding the external payload and wait for the arrival of STS-133, since STS-133 was carrying the Logistics Carrier 4 stowage platform to install the external payload.  Launch and rendezvous with ISS  A close-up view of Kounotori 2 photographed by an STS-133 crew member on the departing space shuttle Discovery. The Canadarm2 moves HTV-2 back to the nadir port of Harmony on 10 March 2011. Kounotori 2 was initially scheduled to launch on 20 January 2011, but this was postponed for two days due to a bad weather forecast. The H-IIB rocket with Kounotori 2 onboard was successfully launched from Tanegashima Space Center on 22 January 2011, 05:37:57 UTC. It made its rendezvous with the space station for a subsequent docking to the Harmony module's nadir port on 27 January 2011. The space station's Space Station Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm2) grabbed Kounotori 2 at 11:41 UTC as the vehicles flew over the southern Indian Ocean. Kounotori 2 was berthed to the space station using the Canadarm2. The Canadarm2 was controlled by Expedition 26 flight engineers Catherine Coleman and Paolo Nespoli using the Robotic Work Station (RWS) in the observatory module Cupola which provided them with increased situational awareness by enabling a 360° view of the exterior of the space station. The berthing was completed at 14:51 UTC after bolts engaged inside the berthing port to firmly attach the spacecraft to the International Space Station.  Operation while berthed to ISS  While Kounotori 2 was berthed to the ISS, the crew entered and removed the supplies from the HTV PLC. Space shuttle mission STS-133 arrived while Kounotori 2 was berthed to ISS. To avoid interference with the payload bay of the shuttle, Kounotori 2 was relocated from Harmony nadir port to zenith port. This was done on 18 February 2011, before the launch of STS-133. After space shuttle Discovery departed the International Space Station and the STS-133 mission was completed, on 10 March 2011, the ISS crew robotically relocated Kounotori 2 back to the nadir port of the Harmony module. The moving operation began at 11:49 UTC. The spacecraft was attached to the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) at Harmony's Earth-facing nadir port at 16:19 UTC. The CBM bolts were fastened at 17:20. The five-hour- long moving operation was completed when the space station crew completed the connections of the electrical cables/lines between the Kounotori's Pressurized Logistics Module (PLC) and the Harmony module at 18:55 UTC. During the stay of Kounotori 2 at the ISS, the M-9.0 earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011. The ground control center in Tsukuba was damaged, and the monitoring operation had to be handed over temporarily to NASA. Mission control room resumed the operation on 22 March 2011.  Crew aboard the ISS  Kounotori 2 was detached and released on 28 March 2011. The ISS crew upon the arrival of Kounotori 2 were the members of Expedition 26: * Scott J. Kelly, NASA, Commander * Aleksandr Kaleri, Roscosmos * Oleg Skripochka, Roscosmos * Dmitri Kondratyev, Roscosmos * Catherine Coleman, NASA * Paolo Nespoli, European Space Agency (ESA)  Departure and reentry  After an extended two-month stay, on 28 March 2011, Kounotori 2 was detached from the docking port by robotic hand at 15:29 UTC and released at 15:46 UTC. It reentered the Earth's atmosphere at around 03:09 UTC on 30 March. The reentry was logged by a Reentry Breakup Recorder, one of two carried to the station; the other was installed in the Johannes Kepler ATV and was intended to record its return, but failed to make contact following reentry; consequently, no data was retrieved.

It started on September 1, 2008 and will end on August 31, 2011. The SM4All project aims at studying and developing an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services in immersive and personcentric environments, through the use of composability and semantic techniques, in order to guarantee dynamicity, dependability and scalability, while preserving the privacy and security of the platform and its users. This is applied to the challenging scenario of private/home/building in presence of users with different abilities and needs (e.g., young able bodied aged and disabled).Catarci, T. et al. (2007). Smart Homes for All: Collaborating Services in a for-All Architecture for Domotics. CollaborateCom 2007. New York, USA  Project partners  SAPIENZA Universita di Roma Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) Elsag Datamat Technische Universitaet Wien Fondazione Santa Lucia Guger Technologies University of Groningen Thuiszorg Het Friese Land Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan  Technical approaches  In the design of the SM4All platform, there will be a specific focus on ontologies for describing service capabilities, to be used for obtaining the dynamic configuration and composition of the services, while preserving the privacy of the users. Within this project an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services by leveraging on peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies will be investigated. In particular, in the SM4All project, P2P, service orientation and context-awareness are merged in novel ways in order to define general reference architecture for embedded middleware targeted to immersive scenarios, among which the domotics and home-care have been selected as showcases.CORDIS RTD-PROJECTS/©European Communities (2009): Smart homes for all; an embedded middleware platform for pervasive and immersive environments for-all (SM4All).Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) P2P systems (P2P) have become a popular technique to design large-scale distributed applications in unmanaged inter-domain settings, such as file sharing or chat systems, thanks to their capabilities to self-organize and evenly split the load among peers.Baldoni, R. (2009). Dynamic quorums for DHT-based enterprise infrastructures, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing. Volume 68, Issue 9, September 2008, Pages 1235–1249 The platform is inherently scalable and able to resist to devices’ churn and failures, while preserving the privacy of its human users as well as the security of the whole environment. The embedded systems are specialized computers used to control equipment such as the smart homes. To enable interoperation among heterogeneous devices and to provide a service-oriented basis, the project considers XML based protocols such as Web services and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).Aiello, M. and S. Dustdar. Are our Homes Ready for Services? A Domotic Infrastructure based on the Web Service Stack (2008) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 4(4):506-525. For example, a woman wants to take a bath. She enters this goal into the computer. Something happens then: The temperature in the bathroom will rise. The water runs in the bathtub with the preferred temperature. The cupboard opens to offer towels. If the woman is disabled, her nurse will be informed by the system. In SM4All, the focus is on the process-oriented composition of stateful services. The idea is that a triggering condition in the home or a desire of the user can trigger the execution of a complex process. The process is defined in the moment that it needs to be executed. It automatically composes services available on home devices and appliances. The execution of the process thus depends on the context of the home, of its inhabitant and the available services. To achieve this it is necessary to identify the home context, to discover available devices and services and to compose them at execution time. In the SM4All project we consider Automated planning and scheduling approaches for the composition such as the \\"Roman Model\\"Calvanese, D. et al. (2008): Automatic Service Composition and Synthesis: the Roman Model. Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering. IEEE Computer Society Vol31 No.3. p.18ff and the \\"Barbarian\\" constraint based approach.Lazovik, A., M. Aiello, and M. Papazoglou, Planning and monitoring the execution of web service requests. (2006) Journal on Digital Libraries Springer, 6(3):235-246. Two techniques adopted in the SM4All project are Brain Computer Interface for Virtual-Reality Control An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) was connected with a Virtual Reality system in order to control a smart home application. Therefore, special control masks were developed which allowed using the P300 component of the EEG as input signal for the BCI system. Control commands for switching TV channels, for opening and closing doors and windows, for navigation and conversation were realized. Experiments with 12 subjects were made to investigate the speed and accuracy that can be achieved if several hundred of commands are used to control the smart home environment. The study clearly shows that such a BCI system can be used for smart home control. The Virtual Reality approach is a very cost-effective way for testing the smart home environment together with the BCI system.Guger, C. et al. (2008) Control of a Smart Home with a Brain-Computer Interface. Proc. 3rd BCI workshop at University of Technology Graz Service Composition Sensors and devices collaborate one another as service providing and requesting nodes of a network. A service can be a purely information one (e.g., providing the temperature in a room) or a state changing one (closing all the lights in a room). Atomic services are then amenable to discovery and composition, enabling the home to perform complex tasks. The user can than express a goal, such as that of possibly according to some optimality measure. For instance the user may want to take a bath. The goal will be translated into a process invoking various services (turning on the heater in the bathroom, the lights, putting an alarm in the living room, checking that there is hot water available, etc.). Notice that the same goal can take different execution forms in different homes or in different conditions (e.g., the alarm in the living room is not available, but the goal of taking a bath is still satisfied).

MIT is a distribution center for cargo destined for cities within Panama and nearby countries in Central America and the Caribbean. It is one of the largest container transshipment terminals in the region and has direct access into the Colón Free Trade Zone (CFZ). MIT, has multimodal operations including container input and output from rail, vessel and gate operations. History Aerial view of the U.S. Naval Station Coco Solo in 1941 The project area, known as South Coco Solo, was a US Navy seaplane base during the World War II era. The base reverted to Panama under the Torrijos–Carter Treaties of 1977. During the 1980s, the area was used as a storage facility and distribution center for vehicles for Latin America. To avoid the costs and logistics associated with moving cars to and from Cristóbal, it was decided to build a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) berth at the distribution and storage facility and thereby directly import and export vehicles on site. Thus, the original concept of MIT was born. By August 1993, with the entry of the multinational SSA Marine, the original RORO berth concept grew into a project to create a world-class container transshipment facility equipped with over 1,200 meters of berth, ship-to-shore gantry cranes, and modern terminal management computer systems. The Atlantic terminus of the re-built Panama Canal Railway was constructed nearby. MIT began operations on April 16, 1995. Geographical Information * MIT's geographical position is . * The access channel is 3.0 kilometers from sea buoy. * The breakwater opening is 200 meters wide, and the access channel has a depth of 14.0 meters. * The turning basin diameter is 600 meters. Storage The terminal's total area is 520,000 square meters, with a container storage capacity of 37,000 TEU, and a container repair yard with 15,000 square meters, including 1,300 square meters of undercover repair facility and connections for 1,145 refrigerated containers. Berthing * Main berth: 1,240 meters of contiguous container berth with a depth of 14 meters alongside * Extra berth: 400 meters of container berth with a depth of 14 meters alongside * Ro-ro berth: 300-meter \\"Mediterranean-style\\" ro-ro berth with a depth of 12.5 meters alongside All berths are 2.5 meters above MSL (mean sea level). Tide variance is 30 centimeters. Government Panama’s Quarantine and Customs departments have offices at MIT and can register clearances on MIT’s Mainsail information system. MIT is a phyto-zoosanitary zone certified by Panama’s agriculture department and can handle sensitive agricultural products. Awards The United Kingdom’s Containerisation International named MIT one of the world’s ten most efficient ports, and the terminal has been recognized three times as the \\"Best Container Terminal in the Caribbean\\" by the Caribbean Shipping Association.

Opened in May 1856, it was created to provide a new burial ground for Deal at a time when its general population was expanding and when previous, often ad hoc facilities for dealing with deaths in the area no longer sufficed. The cemetery's civilian burials are managed by Dover Council, and its military burials by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It contains a Cross of Sacrifice of some significance and the burials of military service personnel from Great Britain, Belgium, Canada, and, very unusually, Nazi Germany, many of whom took part in some of the most famous incidents in World War I and World War II, including: the Gallipoli Campaign, the Battle of the Somme, the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid, the Battle of Dunkirk, the Battle of the Denmark Strait and sinking of , the Battle of Britain, and the more modern tragedy of the Deal barracks bombing in September 1989. It also contains 66 local civilian war dead from World War II killed by German bombing and shelling between 1940 and 1945, 127 military burials from World War I (including three unidentified Naval ratings), and 54 from World War II. There is a small mortuary chapel associated with the cemetery, but no dedicated church as such. 1914–1920 Notable Army and Royal Marine Interments from 1914–1920 Image:Zeebrugge Raid graphic.JPG|Graphic depiction of the Zeebrugge Raid in World War 1 File:V Beach Helles Gallipoli.jpg|Cape Helles, Gallipoli, 6 May 1915 File:The Gravestone of Lieutenant Sillitoe.jpg|The Grave of Lieutenant \\"Willie\\" Ernest Sillitoe, Killed in Action aboard HMS Iris, 23 April 1918, in the Zeebrugge Raid. Image:23rd Batalion of Quebec City, second Canadian Expeditionary Force.jpg|The 23rd Infantry Battalion, Second Canadian Expeditionary Force, Quebec City, Canada. The first military burials date from 1914, and the majority of the cemetery's military interments belong to the Great War rather than to World War II. There are also some Royal Marines Light Infantry burials dating to 1919 and 1920, additionally, and quite a number of graves of Canadian nationals. Notable graves include: 1) The graves of two of the Royal Marines killed in the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April of that year: Private John Bostock, CH/19897, and Lieutenant William Edward Sillitoe. Both were from the Royal Marine Light Infantry 4th Battalion. 2) The grave of Private Arthur Maltby, listed as service number 126276, The Royal Montreal Regiment. He died on 27 April 1918. His parents are listed as being Arthur and Elizabeth Maltby, of 256, Huron Street, Stratford, Ontario, Canada, though he is listed as being born in Nottingham, in England. He enlisted in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, on 9 September 1915, aged 20 years and nine months. 3) The grave of Private William Hawley, from the 24th Battalion (Victoria Rifles), from the Canadian Expeditionary Force, regimental number 919811, who died aged 20 on 10 October 1918, just one month before the end of the Great War. Private Hawley was the son of Peter and Mary Hawley, of 114A, Forfar St, Montreal, Quebec he was also not born in Canada, but in County Kerry in Ireland. 4) The grave of Royal Marines Major-general Sir David Mercer, KCB, and holder of the rank of Commandeur of the French Légion d'honneur. Twice mentioned in dispatches, he served in France, Flanders, and in the Gallipoli Campaign. He was associated with the Band of the Royal Marine Light Infantry (Chatham Division), who by his permission played in a World War I memorial concert at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 November 1918.

Wooldridge, also from the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve. 3) The grave of Ordinary Seaman Joseph Arsenault, Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve, Regimental Number VR/3512, from the shore base of HMS Pembroke, who died on 16 June 1917 of unknown causes. 1921–1939: The Deal Cross of Sacrifice File:Allenby.jpg|Field Marshal Allenby Image:The Deal Cross of Sacrifice.jpg|The Deal Cross of Sacrifice Image:The Deal Cross of Sacrifice Inscription.jpg|The Deal Cross of Sacrifice Inscription Image:Gravestone of an Unknown Sailor of the Great War.jpg|Gravestone of an Unknown Sailor of the Great War In November 1925, a war memorial called The Deal Cross of Sacrifice was unveiled by Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby, one of the Great War's most prestigious and controversial British commanders, who was also Captain of Deal Castle at that time. The ceremony was very well-attended, and included two lieutenant generals, a colonel who was also the holder of the Victoria Cross, a major, Deal's mayor, the Town Serjeant bearing the ceremonial mace, councillors, aldermen, priests from three different churches and denominations, Walmer's Council, representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, The Royal British Legion, a large number of war veterans from the Volunteers Old Comrades' Association, and a Guard of Honour from the Royal Marines, who also provided a party of buglers. The ceremony, as reported in the Saturday 14 November 1925 edition of The Deal, Walmer, and Sandwich Mercury newspaper, included the full text of his speech, reproduced here below: This cross of sacrifice which I have been privileged to unveil today is a visible symbol of what is invisible, of that which we carry in our hearts – the memory of, and the gratitude to, those who suffered, fought, and died for us – fought and endured , and that [what] is even more admirable than fighting and endurance. No one except those that fought alongside those who memories are perpetuated here can have the least idea of what their endurance was, the awful suffering that our men went through, in cold, in heat, in drought, in wet and mud, in desert, in every sort of climate, every sort of horrible experience. No one could have carried through with it unless it was well known that they were remembered, that they were in the hearts of their countrymen and of their friends at home, and that did carry them through. Now, they have their reward. It struck me this morning, when the storm calmed down, the wind and the rain dropped so that we now have a calm day, that it is typical of what those men went through. they passed through storm into calm – \\"The worst turns to best, the bleak months end, the elements rage, and vaunting breezes that rave shall dwindle, shall change, shall become first peace out of pain, then light.\\" [Allenby was quoting Robert Browning's poem \\"Prospice\\", here...] And those who have died for us have now entered into the light of heaven, and even as they stepped into heaven, the light shone, the full glory of heaven shone into their unblinking eyes, and they passed into the presence of God – Gentlemen: unafraid, conscious of their work finished, conscious that they had earned the reward which is now theirs. They are now in the light, and through the doors of heaven there is a gleam that comes through to us. We know that the light is there: we know that we have their example before us, and that gleam that we can see through the doors of heaven is a beacon light that will guide our steps for ever along the road of high endeavour.\\" 1940–1945 Notable Naval Interments from WW2 and the Battle of Dunkirk (1940) Image:HMS Wessex.jpg|W-class British destroyer HMS Wessex Image:Dunkirk2.gif|British evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk Image:Polish destroyer Burza.jpg|Polish Navy Wicher-class destroyer ORP Burza There had been no military burials for a generation by the outbreak of World War II, and the need to bury new casualties from the British Expeditionary Force and from action in the English Channel meant the establishment of a new dedicated section in the far northern corner of the cemetery grounds. Notable burials include: 1) Chief Petty Officer William Eden, service number P/K 5943, from the naval shore base of HMS Fervent (which encompassed part of Ramsgate Harbour), who died on 27 September 1939, age and cause of death unknown. 2) Stoker 1st Class William Caisley from the W-class destroyer HMS Wessex. His ship had left Dover on 24 May 1940 with three other warships, the V-class HMS Vimiera, the W-class HMS Wolfhound and the Polish Navy Wicher-class destroyer ORP Burza. The ships had orders to attack German troop formations heading towards Calais, but the Wessex was in her turn attacked by Stuka dive bombers, resulting in the ship sinking and survivors being rescued by the \\"Vimiera\\", which was in turn heavily damaged and forced to withdraw. Stoker Caisley died the next day, presumably of wounds. 3) Able Seaman William Edward Gibbs, who served on board the Royal Navy W-class destroyer HMS Windsor. His ship was part of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla based at Dover, and was taking part in the developing Dunkirk evacuation, the Windsor undertaking patrol and escort duties for some of the ships evacuating allied soldiers from the beaches. On 28 May 1940, his ship came under a coordinated and sustained aerial attack which resulted in the death of himself and 29 of his crew-mates. Despite this, The Windsor, still suffering significant battle damage, returned to Dunkirk and had rescued nearly four thousand troops from the beaches by the culmination of Operation Dynamo. 4) Leading Seaman Stanley George Bone, from the G-class destroyer HMS Greyhound, who died on 31 May 1940. His ship was carrying over 500 troops from the beaches of Dunkirk when it was attacked, resulting in several deaths, his included. The destroyer was badly damaged and had to be taken in tow by the Polish Grom-class destroyer ORP Błyskawica and tugs, and returned to England.

File:Italy-Royal-Airforce.svg|Wing Roundel on fascist-era Regia Aeronautica's aircraft On 29 October 1940, the Royal Marines Barracks in Deal was attacked from the air. Army Stations 29 October 1940, Deal: At 1640 hours, three HE bombs were dropped in the barracks, the casualties being 1 Officer and 7 other ranks killed, 6 Officers and 6 other ranks wounded. Historian David Collyer claims that the bombers were actually not from the Luftwaffe; The bombs fell in Cornwall Road, Cemetery Road, and near the railway bridge in Telegraph Road. My uncle Leslie can remember seeing an Italian aircraft flying by after dropping a bomb in front of the Officers' Mess at the RM depot This would indicate that the attackers were from the Italian Corpo Aereo Italiano equipped with Fiat BR.20 bombers: 29 October 1940 saw a major operation by the Italian Air Corps against Ramsgate, some eleven miles from Deal, and the bombers, painted a green and bright blue and flying in perfect wingtip formation, were accompanied by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escort. Six of the eight casualties were buried side by side, symbolically, in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, in the new Plot C area of the cemetery which already had a number of recent interments by the end of 1940. The casualties were: 1) Second Lieutenant Robert Pynne Nelson, B.A. (Cambridge), aged 28, from the Royal Marines Siege Regiment. He was the son of Robert and Mary Susanna Nelson, of Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4750. His gravestone bears the inscription: A Lover of cricket/He maintained in his life/The spirit of the game Lieutenant Nelson was remembered fondly: I do remember the few friends who were killed. Stephenson was a bright head boy of St John's Leatherhead, the son of Mr Brearly who lived opposite us and the other was Robert Nelson who lived in Harpenden and was captain of Northampton Cricket and he used to give me batting practice. He was a Royal Marine, stationed at Deal where I was and he was struck by a piece of shrapnel. I sketched his gravestone to send home to his parents. I remember him along with the others every November 11. 2) Marine George Frederick Lewis, a veteran soldier of World War I, aged 48, service number CH/16313. No family details are given. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4751. 3) Marine David Girling, aged 48, service number PLY/15078, Son of David and Caroline Girling; husband of Ethel Alice Girling, of Ewhurst, Surrey. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4752. 4) Marine Frederick Henry Drake, aged 50, service number CH/16617, son of Son of Thomas and Elizabeth Drake; husband of Christina Ann Drake, of Walmer, Deal. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4753. His gravestone bears an inscription: God takes our loved ones/From our homes/But never from our hearts/Your loving wife 5) Bugler Henry James Clemenson, aged 26, service number PO/X 625, son of George Charles and Caroline Margaret Clemenson, of Gosport, Hampshire. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4754. 6) Private Frederick John Clifford Drewery, age unknown, service number 4038695, from the King's Shropshire Light Infantry (7th Battalion). No family details are given. He is buried in Plot C. Block 8. Grave 4755. It is to be noticed that Private Drewery was a long way from his unit when he died and there is currently no information on why he was at the Barracks that day. However, his burial plot position indicated that he was a probably a casualty of the events that day. Right next to these casualties of an Italian air raid, three German Luftwaffe air crew from a Dornier bomber are interred. They have their own story to tell. Notable Axis Interments from the Battle of Britain (1940) File:Hamilton Road Cemetery Luftwaffe Aircrew Grave.jpg|A photo of the graves of Leopold Kaluza, Herbert Reinsch,and Heinz Fischer File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-341-0456-04, Frankreich, Flugzeuge Dornier Do 17.jpg|A flight of Dornier D0 17s File:Flint shingle on Kingsdown beach - geograph.org.uk - 236772.jpg|Kingsdown beach, where the remains of the crew were washed up. By Penny Mayes. File:German WWI War Cemetery, Cannock Chase, England.jpgCannock Chase German War Cemetery In Plot C, Block 8 are the graves of three of a four-man Luftwaffe bomber crew whose aircraft, a Dornier Do 17, 3495 U5+DM from Kampfgeschwader 4, a type of plane sometimes referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift (German: \\"flying pencil\\"), had crashed into the sea at 20:40 hours on 9 November 1940, of unknown causes, off the coast of Kingsdown, Kent. Historian David Collyer states that their bodies were washed up on the beach nearby, although the circumstances of their burial indicate that only body parts were found for two of the crew, a third was found more or less intact, and the fourth's remains were, he claims, never recovered. The crew were as follows: a) Unteroffizier Leopold Kaluza, aged 23, from Klausberg (originally in Austria, now in Italy, in the South Tyrol area). (Service Number 58213/87) b) Heinz Fischer, aged 25, from Dresden (Service Number 58213/42, no rank information available) c) Unteroffizier Herbert Reinsch, aged 20, also from Dresden (Service Number 58213/28). Unlike all the other military graves in this cemetery, Heinz Fischer and Herbert Reinsch appear to be buried together in a single grave, and a separate headstone has been erected for Leopold Kaluza, which was erected right next to Fischer's and Reinsch's (see photograph, above). The December 2009 Newsletter from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission explains; Adjoining headstones are also used when the remains of those buried are intermingled. Although individual sets of remains are known, the circumstances of death made it impossible to separate individuals. One of the most common uses of this form of commemoration are the graves of second World War air crew. d) Leutnant Günther Mollenhauer, aged 21, from the city of Sprottau in what was then the German Province of Silesia, and is now called Szprotawa, in Poland. His service number was -53576/636-1./Erg.K.Gr.2, and he was born on 17 October 1919. Leutnant Mollenhauer, who, because of his rank was probably the pilot, was believed missing in action by some historians. However, the records of the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge e. V. (VDK), Dover District Council, and the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) indicate that his body was found on the foreshore of the old Parish of Sholden, on the dunes between Sandown Castle, Kent and the Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club on 15 November 1940, three days after his comrades had been buried in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, and six days after the crash. The date of death of all four of the crew is wrongly listed on their graves as being the 12 and 15 November respectively. This is because the date used is the day they were found washed up on the beach. Leutnant Mollenhauer was not buried in the Hamilton Road cemetery however, and was instead buried in Aylesham cemetery on 18 November, at grave reference \\"P.A.7.\\". The reason why he was buried at Aylesham cemetery is unknown. The Hamilton Road cemetery is the closest, Aylesham is around 8 miles from Deal even by the most direct route, and Dover is half that distance, and has many more cemeteries. However, Aylesham cemetery contains 11 mixed World War II burials, of which six are from the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force (and the majority of interments there are NCOs and junior officer ranks) so it may just be that this cemetery was partly designated for non-British air crew burials at that time. Also, there is no reason to suppose that the British authorities at this time were aware that Leutnant Mollenhauer was from the same plane as Fischer, Reinsch and Kaluza. This might explain why some sources believed Leutnant Mollenhauer was MIA. Although the burials of three of the four crew-members in the cemetery are listed on the Commonwealth War Graves home page for Deal Cemetery, there are no individual cemetery reports for them as there are for the other foreign interments in the cemetery. In 1959, German casualties who were not buried in either military cemeteries or in Commonwealth War Grave Commission plots were moved to Cannock Chase German war cemetery in Staffordshire to be reinterred with other German casualties. The crew of 3495 U5+DM, having already been buried in an administered plot, were not moved, and form part of a very small group of Axis casualties that are still to be found in their original World War II era plots in the United Kingdom and Channel Islands. They are more unusual still, as the VDK specifically states that many of the burials in Cannock Chase consist of casualties from fallen combat aircraft and/or were washed ashore elsewhere, making this unmoved burial an even rarer event. Leutnant Mollenhauer, along with several other Germans who were buried in the Aylesham cemetery, was disinterred on 29 October 1962, and was re-buried in Cannock Chase. His grave is in Block: 1, Row 9, Grave 326. CWGC records indicate that there are less than one hundred remaining German interments in Kent, almost all of whom are buried near World War II RAF Bases; These include eighteen casualties at Margate cemetery which was close to RAF Manston, seventeen at Maidstone Cemetery which was located near RAF Detling & RAF West Malling, and fifty-nine at Hawkinge Cemetery, very close to RAF Hawkinge. Casualty details of German interments are not given in CWGC cemetery reports, however, and the online resources available on the VDK website concentrate around Cannock Chase and St. Peter Port, Guernsey, meaning that German casualty details are generally only obtainable through a direct request to the CWGC or its German counterpart, or by visiting and locating the interments directly. Their bomber was never recovered, and still lies in the English channel as an unmarked war grave. However, the East Kent Mercury newspaper (1 April 2010) has printed a story stating that part of a World War II German bomber – apparently a tail fin and rudder – has been washed up on the beach at Kingsdown after a storm, and that local divers have also previously found a propeller and part of what they believed to be part of the undercarriage. The plane, states the paper, is believed to be that of a Dornier Do 17... The discovery has been officially reported to the Receiver of Wreck. The paper reports that the group of local history enthusiasts who initially identified the plane plan further exploratory diving in the summer of 2010, so see whether the plane can be definitively identified. However, the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 means that any such investigation will have to be on a \\"look but don't touch\\" basis as interference with the wreck is specifically forbidden by the Act. There is also the added complication that if it is likely that human remains will be found, no license to excavate will be issued by the Ministry of Defence. However, the removal of uncertainty about Leutnant Mollenhauer now makes it more likely that the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (which is part of the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency) will, if asked, grant a license for an archaeological investigation, and the Receiver of Wreck has informed the Embassy of Germany in London of the discovery of wreckage from what may have been Leutnant Mollenhauer's Dornier. BBC South East has also run a story on this, featuring a report by Peter Whittlesea, which links the remains specifically to 3495 U5+DM, though this has yet to be proven. The TV report is erroneous, listing the date of the crash as the 12th, and claiming that the body of the pilot was washed up and buried at the cemetery, whereas in fact Leutnant Mollenhauer was interred elsewhere. However, the report was broadcast before the Leutnant's fate was investigated and made apparent. The report does however show a fascinating interview with an eye-witness, a Mr. Peter Kirling, who saw a German bomber crash in the area at the time. It [the bomber] came across the Kingsdown Golf Links and disappeared over the edge of the cliff, and I ran to the edge of the cliff to see if I could see any more of it, but it had disappeared and I just assumed that it had fallen into the sea. The TV report also shows footage of an aircraft's tail section, which at the time was being reserved from degradation by being kept submerged in a children's paddling pool of a local public house. A second bomber, Dornier Do 17Z Werke nr. 1160, call sign 5K+AR, was discovered partially buried and largely intact in the nearby Goodwin Sands on 3 September 2010, and was raised successfully by a salvage company on 10 June 2013. One of the two crew killed is also buried, like Leutnant Mollenhauer, at Cannock Chase.

Corps of Royal Engineers, service number 2077231, Son of Cornelius James Alexander Kelder Buysman and Kathleen Ellen Buysman, of Dulwich, London, who died aged just 21 on 29 July 1940. According to historian David Collyer, he died when he stepped on a land mine at Kingsdown. 2) The Grave of Percy Charles Deniss, a serving member of the Air Raid Precautions organisation (usually abbreviated to the ARP) Rescue service. Husband of Mignon Constance Denniss, of 157 Mill Road, Deal, he died at Park Lane in Deal on 31 August 1940. He was killed in a bombing raid at 13:00 that afternoon that saw six high explosive bombs kill six people, seriously injure another, and slightly injure a civilian. The raid destroyed two houses, seriously damaging over 50 other houses. Another ARP warden, a Mr. Shotbolt, had a lucky escape which saw him with holes in his equipment (including a bicycle and a gas mask) as a souvenir. 3) The Grave of Air gunner Henry Spinner, a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve Sergeant, from No. 77 Squadron RAF, who died on 20 December 1942. No. 77 Squadron RAF were at that time training to use the Handley Page Halifax bombers, based at RAF Elvington in Yorkshire and were not declared operational until the end of January 1943, so Air Gunner Spinner may have died in an air accident. His brother, George David Spinner, is also commemorated on the headstone, having died in the destruction of the Admiral-class battlecruiser, on 24 May 1941. A photograph of him is available on the HMS Hood Association Website. Both men were only 21 when they died. 4) The Grave of Private Ivy Berwick from the Auxiliary Territorial Service, daughter of Thomas Hayton Berwick and Ann Berwick, of Deal, who died aged 25 on 30 April 1942. Little else is known about her, but she appears to be the only female military casualty buried in the cemetery. 5) The grave of James Thomas Bonner, a serving member of the Home Guard, of 22 Beaconsfield Road in Deal, son of George Frederick Bonner and Elizabeth Edith Bonner, who died at the Southern Railway Goods Yard (now Deal Railway Station) on 8 May 1942. The bombing raid at 13:17 that day that also killed two children (see below) and buried several others at a nearby Roman Catholic Convent School. The raid seriously injured ten others, whilst 15 received minor injuries. It also blew the top floor off the Labour Exchange and the librarian working in the library opposite had a fortuitous escape according to an eye-witness report. 6) Police Constable Cecil George Constable, Son of Richard and Emily Constable, who died at 91 Canada Road (opposite the Royal Marines Barracks that was probably the intended target) on 18 May 1942, aged 41, in a hit and run raid at 6:20 am that morning. One old lady who was in bed at that time had a lucky escape when one Bomb failed to explode on contact and went straight through her bedroom walls, apparently coming to a halt on the steps in front of the Gas Company office. 7) The grave of Fireman Terence Albert Ilett, a National Fire Service volunteer who was awarded the Certificate for Gallantry. Son of Albert William and Mary Matilda Ilett, of 8 Flamstead Road, Charlton, London, he died at Dover Road, Walmer on 26 September 1944, aged just 19. 1940 to 1945: Civilian War Graves Image:OperationSealion.svg|Map showing German invasion plans Image:NA-306-NT-3163V.jpg|The aftermath of an air raid during the Blitz Image:Knocked out German coastal battery HD-SN-99-02705.JPG|The German Crisbecq Battery Deal became the target of German bombing raids and shelling from German coastal guns in occupied France from 1940 onwards as part of Operation Sea Lion, and its wide, gently sloping beaches were in the area of the proposed beach-head for the German 16th Army. Raids and shelling targeted infrastructure such as the railways, military targets such as the Royal Marines Barracks, as well as attempting to break down civilian morale. Deal was also in the area where the Battle of Britain was being fought in the air, and civilian casualties were inevitable. Blast injury often meant that victims who survived the initial bombing died soon after from internal injuries with no external sign of trauma or injury. Those who survived both sometime suffered long term problems caused by blast induced neurotrauma or barotrauma. There were a number of major air raids or shelling attacks which caused clusters of fatalities on and around particular dates, and there were many more killed in these raids than are buried in the Hamilton Road cemetery, as some were buried in one of Deal or Walmer's other church graveyards. Husbands and wives died together, often their children too, and occasionally entire families who had the misfortune to be at home together when the bombs started to fall. The inscriptions on the gravestones of civilian War Dead buried in the cemetery provide many unexpected insights into the lives of the people of Deal in the Second World War, the society they lived in, as well as their deaths. 4 October 1940: Luftwaffe Air Raid on Deal This bombing raid at 13:20 on a cold Friday afternoon resulted in severe damage to Union Road, Middle Street, destroyed the Governor's Quarters in Deal Castle, and caused the deaths of eight civilians including three children, the youngest of which was two years old. An eyewitness account from a lady called Mary Osbourn, with classic period British contempt for German attacks, recounts what happened when she, who was in the Greengrocers buying vegetables at the time, saw the bombers overhead: I went straight across the road and up by Simmonds Jewellers and when I reached the corner of Middle Street, I decided to turn left through Boatman's Alley. I had just got to the top, and had turned the corner when the bombs fell on Middle Street. There was a terrible noise as they came raining down, with bricks flying everywhere, and I was blown off my feet. Mr. 'Flint' Roberts came running along and he stopped and asked if I was all right. I wasn't hurt, as the blast had gone over my head, but I was worried at losing the lettuce and tomatoes and had lost my coat. Mr. Roberts helped me to my feet and he then glanced down the little alleyway where one of the bombs had fallen. I wanted to have a look too, but he would not let me... Seven of the eight casualties were buried in Hamilton Road cemetery. 1) Reginald George James Denton, aged just thirteen, who died at home at 21 Union Street along with his mother, May Lilian Denton, aged 32. Her husband and Reginald's father, R.G Denton, is not listed, probably because he was not at home when the attack took place. It is not known if any other members of the family survived. 2) Terrence Alfred Marsh, aged just six, who died at his home at 29 Union Street. He was the son of Son of Alfred and F. Marsh, who survived their son's death. 3) The Gisby Family, who lived at number 47 Middle Street but were killed at number 36. The husband, William George Gisby, of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), 2nd Battalion, died alongside his wife, Lucy Gisby (née Harris) and their two-year-old son William Gisby. 4) Julia Harris, aged 18, who lived, and died at home at 36 Middle Street. She was the daughter of P. and L. Harris. One contributor has provided the author with further information on the background of the Gisby and Harris family. The contributor states that Julia Harris' parents were Patrick and Lucy L Harris, and that Lucy Gisby was actually Julia's older sister. This can be substantiated by cross-referencing the CWGC casualty details which lists P. and L. Harris as parents for both women. As the contributor states, this meant that in one attack, Mr and Mrs. P and L Harris lost their daughters Lucy and Julia, their grandson William, and their son-in-law, William Gisby. It is now clear that it was Private William Gisby that historian David Collyer is referring to when he states that the son-in-law's body was not found until Spring 1941, upon the roof of the (three-storey) Clarendon Hotel in Deal, according to the ARP. This, surprisingly, was not unremarkable, as the force of a Luftwaffe bomb exploding created a shock wave which travelled at supersonic speed, and there were many recorded incidents of civilian casualties in World War II being found in similar circumstances. 5)Harriett Bowles, aged 82, who lived, and died at home at 20 Union Street. She was the widow of Mr. J Bowles. She lived next door to Mrs. Denton and son Reginald, who were also killed. The CWGC site lists her date of death as the 7th, not the 6th as with the rest of the casualties, indicating perhaps that she was buried in the rubble of her house and not discovered until the next day. 20 Union Street – renamed Union Road – was never rebuilt. It is difficult to imagine the sheer scale of this family tragedy, but the destruction that day can now been seen in present-day Deal. Middle Street, now part of the town's historic conservation area, only partially exists today. From the junction of King Street running northwards, it is mostly intact, and the last properties on Middle Street are numbered 61 and 52. The commercial properties next to these that border Middle Street and King Street however are given King Street addresses. Middle Street begins again to the south, bordered by the old Royal Cinema, but stops abruptly and a large central car park begins in an area which probably had in the region of a hundred individual dwellings prior to the War. Union Road was similarly truncated and, like Middle Street, is now partly a car park. Visitors to the Middle Street Library, and shoppers attending the regular Unior Road Saturday Market are unaware that scant feet underneath their cars and market stalls are the remains of so many lost homes and broken lives. 6 May 1942: Luftwaffe Hit and Run Bombing Raid on Deal Gas Works April to June 1942 saw the Baedeker Blitz, a campaign by the Luftwaffe to retaliate for the RAF bombing of Lübeck in March of that year. Although it was Canterbury that was specifically targeted at the end of May and early June 1942, Deal was to see four air raids that caused significant loss of life during the Spring, Summer, and Autumn of this year. On 6 May 1942, bombs were dropped from what one eyewitness, Peggy Oatridge, called Messerschmitt fighter-bombers, on Alfred Square, Park Lane, and Mill Road. It appears that at least one pilot missed his intended target, the Gas Works, and instead the bomb ricocheted off the side of a building, skidded across the road, and then detonated in front of a small parade of shops and a house on the corner of Alfred Square. Seven people were killed, and they were all buried in the Hamilton Road cemetery. They were: 1) Hilda Joyce Finn. Aged 25, she was at home at 16 Alfred Square, when the bombs started falling. She was apparently rescued from the rubble by the ARP, but later died of her wounds at the local Victoria War Memorial Hospital in Deal. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick George Finn. 2) John Arthur Frederick Finn. Aged just 8, he died at home at 16 Alfred Square in the same explosion that claimed the life of his older sister Hilda later that same day. 3) Mother and Daughter Nellie Middleton, aged 48, and Patricia Mary Middleton, aged 15, who both died at home at 17, Alfred Square. Nellie Middleton was the wife of Able Seaman James Middleton, Royal Navy. 4) There were further casualties at Park Lane, about 300 metres south of Alfred Square, where brother and sister James Christopher Milham, aged 64, and May Lillian Mary Milham, aged 60, both died at their home. 5) Sarah May Roots, aged 42, also died in the raid. She died at her home (\\"Holmleigh\\") in Park Lane in Deal, and was the daughter of A. C. Lewin, of Cloudesdale Road, Tooting, London and the wife of Stanley George Roots, who apparently survived. 8 May 1942: First Attack on the Southern Railway's Goods Yard Two days later, on 8 May, two children died in an air raid which killed a member of the Home Guard (see James Thomas Bonner, above). The children were at St Ethelbert's Convent School in Park Street, which was near the railway station, and were: 1) Michael Ryan, aged 11. 2) James Francis Rogan, aged 12. A contemporary of theirs, Thelma Brown, remembers what happened: On 8 May 1942 I was travelling by bus with my two oldest sisters to St. Ethelbert's Convent in Deal, the school was approximately three quarters of a mile from home. I was just six years old at the time and I remember the bus being stopped and we all had to go to the nearest air/raid shelter until the all-clear sounded. When it was considered safe we boarded the bus again and carried on to school — as we approached the school we were stopped again as a bomb had dropped on the playground — my eldest brother was already at school as he had gone by bicycle and we had no way of knowing if he was safe at that time, he was lucky has he had gone to the shelter but his cycle was badly damaged. Unfortunately two boys had gone back to collect their marbles from the playground and were killed (Michael Ryan and James Rogan) and seven others were seriously injured. A different source cites the school as being called St Ethelburga's instead, and on balance of probability in terms of the number of references, this appears to be correct. 11 August 1942: Second Luftwaffe Attack Raid on the Southern Railway's Goods Yard 250px August continued to be probably the deadliest month of the War for Deal, as the Luftwaffe kept up their Hit and Run tactics. The evening of the 11th saw a particularly devastating raid, carried out by Luftwaffe fighter-bombers which happened \\"without warning\\" according to the ARP Records, at seven minutes past six in the evening. The attack focussed on civilian and military infrastructure targets; Deal's Gas Works (the target of the previous unsuccessful raid on 6 August), the Southern Railway Goods Yard (attacked three days earlier), the local Bus Garage belonging to the East Kent Road Car Company, and some eighteen houses in College Road and Albert Road near the targets were destroyed, with another 300 being seriously damaged. The casualties were as follows: 1) Edward John Toomey, who died aged just 16, on Tuesday 11 August 1942, at Albert Road which bisects the main railway line. Toomey was a \\"Police Messenger\\", analogous to that of Fire Guard Messengers, who were used by the A.R.P. at a time when radio or telephone methods of communication were uncertain or disrupted. Police Messengers were a uniformed service made up in many cases of children up to the age of 18, who were used to relay information between policeman, special constables, and to act as runners \\"in case of air raids, invasions, or emergencies,\\" in the words of one ex-Messenger, William Rorison Gray. Edward Toomey is also listed as having been a member of the newly established Air Training Corps. The organisation was designed at that time to prepare cadets for entry into the RAF, and for those adolescents old enough to join, duties could include loading ammunition, filling sandbags, even in some cases handling aircraft. ATC Cadets were often sent to \\"Camp\\", which usually meant one or two weeks' service at an operation RAF base where they sometimes helped serving personnel with their work. 2) Edith Grace Burley (née Higgins), aged 51. She died at home at 64 College Road, and was the daughter of Edward and Emily Higgins, of 13 College Road, She was survived by her husband, Walter John Burley, but it is not known whether they had any children. 3) Edith's brother, Percy Higgens, aged 46, who also lived at 64 College Road. He is listed as having died at College Road, though the exact location is not given. According to contemporary reports, a bomb fell next to Swaffield's Laundry, completely destroying number 66 and 68 College Road, and severely damaging number 64, where Mr. Higgins lived. A photograph showing College Road after this attack shows an ARP Rescue Squad climbing over a large pile of bricks that once were two semi-detached houses, vainly looking for survivors. It is very likely therefore that Both Edith and Percy were at home when it happened. 4) Emma Cavell, aged 77, who lived at 178, the High Street in Deal. She was the daughter of the late Edward Brooksby Cavell, and died at Albert Road. Normally, the casualty details specifies a house number if the death took place at an identifiable address, so it is possible that Emma Cavell was unfortunate enough to be walking along Albert Road at the time. 5) Charles James Cotton, aged 59, husband of Matilda Cotton, of 1 Bush Avenue, Ramsgate. Mr Cotton appears to have been visiting Deal that day and was unfortunate enough to be in the Albert Road or College Road area at the time. The circumstances of his death, as well as those of Emma Cavell, indicates that either the raid was a surprise and the air raid sirens did not go off in time to allow them to get to a public shelter, or they did not sound at all. Like Hilda Finn, he was probably rescued by the ARP who took him by ambulance to the Victoria War Memorial hospital in Deal, where he later died. An anonymous contributor has recently indicated to this article's author that Charles Cotton was the contributor's great grandfather, was a steam locomotive driver, and was indeed \\"killed in a bombing raid while he was driving the Engine.\\" At Ramsgate Railway station, there is a plaque, laid in 2001, which commemorates a C. Cotton and a W. Edwards as being \\"killed by enemy action\\", but it does not say where this happened, or the first names. However, it seems to be evidence of the above. Further documentary confirmation is probably required, but this evidence would however explain Mr Cotton's presence in Deal, and further suggest that one of the bombs that hit Albert Road (which bisects the railway line through Deal) could have killed Mr Cotton. 6) Florence Goodban, aged 29, who lived at 88 College Road, and died at College Road, though the records do not say exactly where. She was the daughter of Mrs. V. Atkinson, and Florence was married to Mr. Edward Charles Goodban. 7) Charlotte Pittock, aged 35, whose father is listed as living at 1, Finesbury Road, Ramsgate. However, this appears to be a misspelling, as there is a Finsbury Road which lies just off the modern A255 in Ramsgate, and most of the houses there appear to date from the 19th and early 20th century, indicating that the road name is incorrectly spelled in the records. However, the CWGC is aware of the error and have amended their records, though it may be some time before the website details are updated to match. Her father lived less than a mile from Charles Cotton (see above), though there is no direct evidence that the two families knew each other. However, circumstantially, it is quite a coincidence that this is the only recorded occasion in World War II Deal where two visitors from the same town died in the same air raid, in the same area of the town, and had male and female versions of the same name (\\"Charles\\" and \\"Charlotte\\"). She was the daughter of Charles Cullen, and married to George Pittock, and lived at \\"The Oaks\\", College Road, in Deal. Again, the exact place of death is not listed, but the records state she died in the same road she lived in with her husband. 8) Florence Lucy Clara Redsull, aged 64, who lived at 66 College Road, and was married to Mr. Robert Redsull. Again, she is listed as having died at College Road, probably at home as her house was totally destroyed by the bomb. 22 October 1942: Luftwaffe Hit and Run Raid on Deal High Street At 9 am on the morning of 22 October, the Luftwaffe hit non- strategic targets in a civilian area of Deal, specifically the High Street and College Road (for the second time in less than a week) causing great loss of life, as many people were out shopping. Fifteen people died that morning including eight children. One family even lost a mother and both of her very young children in what was one of the most horrific attacks in Deal's history. Thirteen of them were subsequently buried in the Hamilton Road Cemetery. The casualties were: 1) Edna Antcliff, aged 16. She was the daughter of Mrs. E. Marples (formerly Antcliff) and of the late Herbert Antcliff and lived at 79 Cavell Square, Mill Hill. She died in the High Street. Given this is over a mile away, it is likely Edna was out shopping when the attack happened. 2) William Albert Bransby, aged 59. of 92A High Street. Died at High Street. 3) Amy Agnes Bransby age unknown. (otherwise BRANSBY). of 92A High Street. Widow of Edwin W. Smith. Died at High Street. She is likely a relation of William Bransby, but nothing more is known apart from the fact they lived at the same address. 3) William Henry Brown aged 49. Husband of Ada Mary Brown, of 4 Westfield Cottages, Cannon Road. He died at the High Street, though his wife either survived or was elsewhere at the time of the attack. 4) Elsie Alice Burgess aged 26, and lived at 22, College Road. Daughter of Thomas R. and Bertha J. Cannon, of 10 Prince's Street (which is just off the High street at its northern end; wife of Richard Benjamin Burgess. She died at home, though her husband apparently survived. 5) Kay Barbara Burgess aged 15 months; of 22 College Road. Daughter of Richard Benjamin Burgess, and of Elsie Alice Burgess. She died at home along with her mother. 6) Ean Richard Burgess aged 3, of 22 College Road, Deal, Kent. Son of Richard Benjamin Burgess, and of Elsie Alice Burgess (above). Injured 22 October 1942, at 22 College Road; died at Hurstwood Park War Emergency Hospital, Haywards Heath, some one hundred miles away from Deal, on 25 October. Tragically, Mr. Richard Burgess had now lost both of his young children as well as his wife. This hospital crops up several times in CWGC archives in the casualty detail of civilians and serving members of the armed forces. In each case, they had been injured elsewhere, and moved, often some considerable distance, to this unit. One reference states that it was a specialist neurosurgical unit. 7) Jane Elizabeth Burke aged 80, of 28 College Road. Daughter of the late William and Jane Wiltshire, of Portsmouth; widow of James Burke. She died at her home address. 8) Raymond John Giles aged 14. Son of Arthur and Kate Gertrude Giles, of 7 Northway, Betteshanger Colliery. Died at High Street. David Collyer lists him as Raymond Files instead. Raymond was last thought to be seen in the basement of Gordon Blain's Greengrocer's shop in the High Street. The shop, and three others, were reduced to rubble, and many others were very badly damaged. His next door neighbour, Mary Osbourn, who nearly died in a 1940 attack on Middle Street (see above), and may well have been in the same greengrocers two years previously, recounted that Raymond's father asked his neighbours in Betteshanger for help to find his son. They, en masse, came into Deal, standing in the back of an old lorry, and dug away at the rubble of the shop until two O'Clock in the morning. Eyewitness accounts do not make it clear whether his body was ever found or not. 9) Kenneth Percival Moodie aged 13. Son of Frederick Percy Moodie, of 5 Forlands Estate, Telegraph Road. He died at the High Street, a mile or so away from his home. 10) Thelma Gwendoline Nicholls aged 14, who lived at 10 Frederick Road, Mill Hill. Daughter of the late Robert Thomas Nicholls, she died at the High Street. 11) Joyce Edith Hughes aged 14. Daughter of Leading Seaman Edward William Hughes, R.N., and May Elizabeth Hughes, of 127 Edward Terrace, Mill Hill. She died at the High Street. 12) Patricia Rebecca Rigden aged 15. Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Edward Rigden, of 19 Mayers Road, Walmer. She also died at the High Street. 13) Ethel Jessie Mary Snelling aged unknown. Daughter of J. W. Salmon, of Laburnham Cottage, Weeley Heath, Clacton-on-Sea; wife of John Edward Snelling, of Sunnycot, Godwyn Road in Deal. She died at 26 College Road. 14) Lucy Spinner aged 66. She was the daughter of David Markham, of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire; wife of Charles Tigwell Spinner, of Walmer Place Lodge, Walmer. She died at the High Street. There is an unusual ending to this tragic day. One of the bombs that hit the High Street shattered the large stained glass window at the eastern end of the chancel of St. George the Martyr Church in Deal, which had been installed in 1867 by Dr. G.R. Carter. All that was left after the bombing was a single shard of glass that was incorporated into the new window. It bore a single word: \\"Hope\\". 5 November 1942: Cannon Street Situated so close to Deal's main railway line, Cannon Street was once again on the receiving end of imprecise Luftwaffe ordnance. One bomb demolished three houses next to each other and there were yet more casualties; three dead, one person seriously injured, and six people were slightly injured according to the ARP in raid that happened in the morning. The three dead buried here were: 1) Alfred Thomas Smith, aged 71, of 4 Cannon Street, Deal. He was the husband of Edith Ellen Smith, he died at home with his wife, Edith (see below). 2) Edith Ellen Smith, aged 64, she died at home along with her husband, Alfred. 3) Sarah Ann May Anderton, aged 22, of 2 Cannon Street. She was the daughter of David and Mary Oatridge, and the wife of Harry Anderton. She died at home, though her husband is not listed, either because he survived, or because he was not at home at the time. 20 January 1944: The Roberts Street Shelter Attack One of the worst attacks on civilians happened on 20 January 1944, when a civilian shelter and its immediate vicinity was hit by German shellfire from France, killing twelve, including a number of women and children. The shell attack, which started at 5:00 am, hit the civilian street shelter which was being used by only women and children (apparently to allow the men to smoke in a separate shelter next door) in Robert Street in Deal at 5:30 am. An eye-witness at the time claimed that the blast of the explosion killed everyone in the first shelter without leaving a mark on their bodies, though the men, some of whom were their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons in the adjoining shelter escaped, apparently without a scratch. The event was not mentioned at all in the local newspaper, perhaps because of wartime restrictions on reporting, or perhaps because of the desire not to give the enemy any useful propaganda, or perhaps simply because the authorities did not wish to let the German gunners know where their shells had landed so that this information could be used to improve their fire-control. The truth will probably never be known. The casualties included: 1) The Grave of Mrs. Zipporah Smith, who died, aged 30, at her home address on 20 January 1944. She is listed as being an A.R.P. Ambulance Attendant, and lived, and died, at 7A Robert Street in north Deal. Daughter of Mrs. S. McLeod (formerly Thirkettle), of 36 Barclay Street, Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, and of the late Thomas John Thirkettle. As an Ambulance Attendant, Mrs. Smith would have worked occasionally gruelling shifts, sometimes concurrently, and deal with a range of duties from evacuating the elderly and infirm from sites where an unexploded bomb was, transporting casualties to nearby Deal hospital, and dealing with injuries ranging from the minor scratch through to life-threatening injuries, sometimes in the most appalling circumstances imaginable. Edith Myra Taylor, one ex-ARP Ambulance worker from Kent, remembered what it was like: One lunchtime Elsie and I were eating our sandwiches at a small infant's desk. There had been no air raid siren but we could hear a plane and thought it one of ours — suddenly we heard the loud swish of bombs falling and our building shook. The grills in the ceiling discharged a load of soot, covering our food and us. We saw that a bomb had fallen on Milburn Road opposite the depot so off we went. The road was full of potholes, flints and lumps of concrete; water was escaping everywhere from the mains, as well as gas, so people were warned not to smoke. A house had received a direct hit; neighbours thought both husband and wife were at work, but someone then said they thought she had gone indoors and was wearing a purple coat. After some time searching through the extensive rubble our rescue squad found the purple coat and hung it on the fence next to me. An unexploded bomb went off down the road and an air raid shelter came flying over the roof of the house. Eventually, with the help of her husband and a passing naval officer her body was located under the kitchen table. I waited while her remains were extracted and wrapped in two army blankets. We were not supposed to take bodies but to leave them for the mortuary ambulance; as this was occupied down in Medway Road with several casualties, I had to remove her. I remember looking back through the ambulance and seeing long brown wavy hair hanging over the edge of the stretcher. When I got to the mortuary, actually a row of garages at the back of the school in Green Street, I followed Roy Spenceley the mortician to regain my blankets, which we had strict instructions not to part with, as these were in short supply. I shall never forget the sight that met my eyes... As everything was stuck to the blankets, we could not retrieve them and had to make our excuses back at the depot. For a long time afterwards I have remembered how sick I felt and how I couldn't stop retching. Zipporah Smith was eventually a victim herself of one of the most bloody attacks in Deal in the entire war. Her husband, Ernest Smith, is not listed, either because he survived, or because he was not there at the time of the attack. 2) Mr. John Reed aged 31, of 9 Robert Street. Son of G. Reed, of 1 Bungalow, Deerson Farm, Preston, Canterbury. Mr Reed died at 9 Robert Street, which was later demolished. 3) Mr. William Richard Mockett aged 66, who lived and died at 1A Robert Street, Deal. The grave of Emma, Edith, and Margaretta Newing 4) Three members of the same family, who all lived at Faber Villa in Robert Street. They were Mrs. Emma Francis Newing (née Rice), who had married into the Newing family. Her sisters-in-law both died, their names being Edith Hilda Newing, and her older sister Margaretta Annie Newing. They were buried side by side in a large plot, which, unlike many of its contemporaries, remains very well-maintained. The inscription on their grave mentions each by name as well – very unusually – as a description of the circumstances in which they died. An entry in the personal section of the local newspaper, The Deal, Walmer and Sandwich Mercury, appeared several weeks afterwards, apparently placed by the remaining members of the Newing family, thanking everyone for their expressions of sympathy and support, without mentioning the circumstances in which Emma, Edith, and Margaretta died. Such was wartime. Faber Villa was damaged but repaired and still stands today, though the property next door was demolished, as were many others in the street which were never rebuilt. This, perhaps, stands as a metaphor for the lives affected by this incident. 5) A 28-year-old mother and her two young daughters. Gladys Clarice May Dunn died, as well as her 10-month-old infant, Joyce Phyllis Dunn, and her six-year-old sister, Barbara Lilian Joan Dunn as well. The family lived nearby in 25 Princes Street which extends directly into Robert Street. She was survived by her husband, Edward J. Dunn, though it is unclear what happened to him or if the couple had any other children, and the entry in the \\"deaths\\" section of the local newspaper the week afterwards does not specify. 6) Eliza Friend, 48, of 8 Robert Street, wife of Albert Edward Friend She is specifically listed as having died in the Robert Street Shelter, and was remembered in the Personal section of the local newspaper the week afterwards. 1946–1988: Zeebrugge Remembered Image:Lieutenant William E. Sillitoe.jpg|Lieutenant William E. Sillitoe. Image:Churchill portrait NYP 45063.jpg|Sir Winston Churchill Image:Zeebrugge Memorial and Graves from St James Cemetery in Dover.jpg|Zeebrugge Plot at St James Cemetery in Dover. Image:Dedication Text of Zeebrugge Cross of Sacrifice in Dover.jpg|Zeebrugge Cross of Sacrifice, St James Cemetery in Dover. On St. George's Day, 1964, nine of the 46 survivors then remaining of the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid (from the 1,700 who originally took part) commemorated their lost in a service presided over by the Commandant-General of the Royal Marines, General Sir Malcolm Cartwright-Taylor, KCB, and the Mayor of Deal, Alderman Norman Cavell, JP. It was attended by local dignitaries, representatives from the armed forces, and a personal message from Sir Winston Churchill, himself a freeman of the town of Deal, was read out to those assembled. It is most fitting that the remarkable and valiant action at Zeebrugge should be commemorated here in Deal, in concert with the tribute to the famous Royal Marines. I send all those at the ceremony, and in particular the survivors, relatives and friends of those who took part in the Zeebrugge raid, my greetings and warm good wishes. The extensive newspaper coverage of the event notes that the main ceremony took place at the Depot in the main barracks in Deal, and that on 24 April, a visit was arranged to St James's Cemetery in Dover where many casualties from the raid were buried some forty-six years previously, and where there is a special \\"Zeebrugge\\" Plot with its own Cross of Sacrifice, and a remembrance service is held on St. George's Day. There was no mention of the Hamilton Road cemetery or any visits having taken place to the graves of Lieutenant Sillitoe or Private Bostock (the two casualties of the Zeebrugge Raid buried in the cemetery) in the newspaper reports of the time. Their youngest comrades in arms would have, by this time, been pensioners, and there is only a slight chance that they would have been known or remembered personally by the few remaining ex-Royal Marines Light Infantry of the 4th Battalion who were still alive in 1964. 1989: The Deal Barracks Bombing Image:Hamilton Road Cemetery Royal Marines Bandsmen.jpg|Graves of Royal Marines Bandsmen killed by the IRA in 1989 Image:The Gravestone of Christopher Robert Nolan.jpg|The Gravestone of Christopher Robert Nolan Image:The Gravestone of Dean Patrick Pavey.jpg|The Gravestone of Dean Patrick Pavey Image:The Gravestone of Mark Timothy Petch.jpg|The Gravestone of Mark Timothy Petch There were no new military interments in the Hamilton Road cemetery after the end of World War II, and it returned to its original role as a municipal facility. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission continued to maintain the military plots of friend and foe alike; the grass was neatly cut, the Portland stone scrubbed clean, but the cemetery's honoured dead were beginning to fade into memory. Where Allenby once stood, the local papers now chronicled troublesome teenagers causing a nuisance late at night. This all changed in 1989, in the Deal barracks bombing. Three of the eleven Bandsmen killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army were subsequently buried in the Hamilton Road cemetery, the first military burials in some forty-two years. They were: 1) Musician Christopher Robert Nolan, service number PO37119V, aged just 21. 2) Band Corporal Dean Patrick Pavey, service number PO32835W, aged 31. 3) Musician Mark Timothy Petch, service number PO36893W, aged 26. Both Band Corporal Pavey and Musician Petch died in the explosion, whereas Robert Nolan died on his wounds some twenty-six days later on 18 October 1989. Their graves are located are in the area of the cemetery managed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the same section as the majority of the cemetery's World War II casualties, in a place of honour. Even today, some twenty-one years after the event, flowers are still to be found on their graves. Hamilton Road Cemetery today For the last twenty-one years, there have been no new military interments, and today the cemetery is still in use. The older public graves, especially those from the 19th century are in an increasingly poor state of repair; many gravestones are wrapped in hazard tape, others tilt at alarming angles, some headstones and crosses lie snapped at their base, and others have been pushed over and lie on the earth in the name of Health and Safety. One sturdier grave even sees use as a workbench for contractors cutting tree branches. Most of the civilian war graves from 1940–1945 are in poor repair with a few exceptions, and the inscriptions on these are becoming almost impossible to read. There seems little chance that this will change anytime soon. References Sources  * Military war dead. ** Civilian war dead.

The Department for protection and scientific study of Cultural Monuments in Belgrade issued a decision in 1948, in which the Romanesque church of Arača was placed under state protection. History It was built around 1230 during administration of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was robbed and devastated in 1280 and reconstructed in 1370 as required by the Queen Elizabeth, it is this time that the Gothic tower that exists today was, probably, built. In 1417 it came into possession of the Serbian despot Stefan Lazarević. Later it belonged to Serbian despot Đurađ Branković who gave it, as a present, to Pál Birinyi. In 1551 Ottomans burned the cathedral down and it was never reconstructed again. In the end of the 18th century it was a possession of Sissány family. Extensive excavation and general protection of sites and conservation-restoration works were performed in the period 1970-1978. Works were organized by Regional Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments / Vojvodina, Novi Sad /, and they were managed by Sandor Nagy, archaeologist of Vojvodina Museum in Novi Sad. Conservation and restoration work, and work on technical documentation were organized by Miomir Petrović, technician conservator of the Provincial Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, with the involvement of Milka Čanak, conservator of the Republic Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments, Belgrade. Location The ruin is on the right terrace, about 13 km east of the Tisa river bed. The church and monastery are on the bank of Crna bara at an altitude of 80.00 meters. This swampy depression is on the same altitude as the Tisa. Arača was connected with Bečej fortress, on the bank of the Tisa, and nowadays the route is still visible through the middle of the raster field, with a length of about 13 km. Excavations Excavations organized at the end of the 19th century were submitted to light findings that greatly enriched the knowledge of Arača, and simultaneously became the trademark of this place. Excavation was led by archaeologist Gerece Péter in 1896. Arača stone soon became the subject of interest and discussion, speculation, and analysis that is largely related to the review and interpretation of characters in one of the broad side plates. To a lesser extent, commented the ornaments on the sides of the same plate.  Protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities The state takes care of the site, and the Law on Protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of SFR Yugoslavia and solutions from 16 February 1948 said this: \\"The Arača-Romanesque church in ruins at Vološinova, county of Begej, AP Vojvodina is considered as national importance monument, and it is placed under the protection of the state with its immediate surroundings.\\" The explanation further states: \\"Three-aisled basilica, Benedictine Dalmatian-type built in the XIII century on the foundations of the older building, the church Arača twice destroyed, and preserved until today, have some parts of its massive buildings which can be used for studying the cultural history of our people.\\" This decision preceded the modest excavations carried in 1946 by Đorđe Mano-Zisi. In the Tisa River where Arača is, this kind of the foundation have already been seen. In addition to that good, practical, simple and permanent solution, it is certain that for those who have established Arača, these places of the world had a deeper meaning, primeval later transpose to the ideas of Christianity. Basilica of Arača is the three-aisled, with three semi-circular apses, from inside and outside. The width of the apse in the middle of the ship is about 4.9 m, with a depth of about 2.6 m. The width of the apse side is about 2.7 m, with a depth of about 1.4 m. Organization, relations and dimensions of apses, pointing to the parish church. Arača was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. The Department of Material Engineering of the Faculty of Technology in Novi Sad in cooperation with the Provincial Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments has begun a series of sampling and testing of the materials used in building Arača in 2015.

Life Born in Paris in 1676, she was one of many illegitimate children that Louis XIV had. She was officially declared daughter of Philippe de Maisonblanche, old Captain of the Guards, and of Lady Gabrielle de La Tour, his spouse.fille de Philippe de Maisonblanche, ancien capitaine de cavalerie, et de dame Gabrielle de la Tour, son épouse Brought up in Paris by her mother, she did not receive the same attention that the daughters of Madame de Montespan and Louise de La Vallière did. She lived for a while at the château de Suisnes where her mother died in 1687 aged 50. Louise was then put in the care of François Le Signerre and her sister Catherine Le Signerre in Mulcent. Louise remained confined at Mulcent with the Le Signerre sisters till the age of 20 in 1696. On 17 April that year, she married Bernard de Prez, Baron of La Queue. He was the lieutenant to the regiment of Burgundy. The Abbé de Brisacier undertook the service which was overseen by Alexandre Bontemps, the first gentleman of the chamber of Louise's father, Louis XIV.Mathieu da Vinha: Les valets de chambre de Louis XIV - (voir Bontemps). It was Bontemps who secured the small dowry of 40,000 Livres along with silver and jewels for the bride. This dowry was nothing compared to the dowries of her other half sisters; the Dowager Princess of Conti (1666–1739) who married Louis Armand de Bourbon in 1680 was given 1 Million Livres as did the Duchess of Bourbon who married in 1685 to Louis de Bourbon. In 1692 another sister the Françoise Marie de Bourbon married Philippe d'Orléans and had been given 2 Million Livres as well as the Palais-Royal in Paris. Her husband was later named the Kings gardes du corps and this allowed Louise to frequent the court at Versailles with her husband. Issue From her marriage, she was named dame Louise de Maisonblanche, fille naturelle du Roi. That style was shown on the birth certificates of her children. The couple had 11 children, 5 of which died in infancy: #Louise Renée de Prez (Montfort l'Amaury, 27 October 1699 – 1705). Died aged 6 of measles. #Louis Bernard de Prez (Montfort l'Amaury, 17 March 1701). Stillborn. #Charlotte Angélique de Prez (Montfort l'Amaury, 11 October 1703 – 1723). Died of hypothermia after falling into a lake. #Louis Charles Timothée de Prez (14 October 1704 – 1746). Died after falling from a horse; married on 2 November 1745 to Madeleine Marguerite Charlotte Soulaigre des Fossés. #A son [Stanislas Henri de Prez?] (Montfort l'Amaury, 4 September 1706). Stillborn. #Alexandre Paul Cyr de Prez (Montfort l'Amaury, 5 August 1708 – Neauphle le Vieux, 8 October 1777). Died of a cerebral embolism; married firstly on 3 February 1755 to Marie Jeanne de Malebranche and secondly in 1763 to Claude Marguerite Le Cousturier du Meny. #Louise Catherine de Prez (La Queue-les-Yvelines, 16 June 1709 – 1756). Died of a stroke; married on 10 October 1745 to Timothée de Vaultier de Petitmont. #Françoise de Prez (5 January 1711 – 1715). Died of scarlet fever. #Guillaume Jacques de Prez (Gallais, 15 November 1713 – La Queue les Yvelines, 5 October 1804). Died of a heart attack; married in 1754 to Françoise Perrette Le Boeuf. #Marguerite Françoise de Prez (Gallins-la-Queue, 15 May 1715 – Montfort l'Amaury, 1786). Died of pneumonia. #Philippe Charles de Prez (Gallins-la-Queue, 8 August 1718 – February 1719). Died aged 6 months of chickenpox. Two of her daughters, Charlotte Angélique and Louise Catherine were raised at Saint-Cyr-l'École, the home of Madame de Maintenon's famous school for young ladies of the nobility. They were both called a petit-fille du Roi in their dossiers at Saint-Cyr. Louise died of smallpox on 12 September 1718 at La Queue-les-Yvelines, during the Regency of her brother in law, Philippe d'Orléans. Because Louise's mother was known to had several lovers, the king always doubt about his paternity, and for this he never recognised Louise and kept her away from court, treating her poorly at the time of her marriage. Although eyewitnesses say she strongly resembled to him, the king never acknowledged her as his daughter. Contemporary accounts *Bontemps, the king's confident for his domestic secrets had stated that without any father or mother, the bride of La Queue was promised a fortune for the marriage. The woman was very similar to the king, she was great and, unfortunately for him, she knew who she was, and strongly envied her three sisters and their great marriages. She and her husband lived well together and had several children who remained in the obscurity. The oldest son almost appeared at court as the simplest and least officer collected in the crowd who Bontemps didn't fail to give from time to time money.Extract from the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, Vol. 7-8, p. 219, quoted by Jean Lemoine. *This Louise de Maisonblanche was a natural daughter of the king and N...des Œillets, which was a companion of Madame de Montespan. As the king didn't want to recognise her, he baptised and married her under false names of her father and mother because she didn't want to be a nun. It was the Abbé de Brisacier, Director of the Seminary of Foreigners, who married her as her guardian following the King orders and directed by Madame de Maintenon, and also established the conditions of her marriage contract including the dowry who was quite small compared with the other daughters of the King.Charles-René d'Hozier, Genealogist of the King, quoted by Jean Lemoine.

The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. While passing Røros, the Heron started experiencing a rapid atmospheric icing which soon was too extensive for the ice protection system to handle. Combined with a downdraft, the aircraft lost sufficient lift to stay airborne. The pilots were able to turn the aircraft around, but it nevertheless hit Hummelfjell at an altitude of above mean sea level. The aircraft's captain was killed on impact, and a passenger died shortly afterwards. Ten people survived the crash, which was the first fatal accident of a Braathens SAFE. Among the survivors was Rolf Kirkvaag, at the time Norway's most popular radio host. The search and rescue operation was severely hindered by a blizzard and poor visibility. Kirkvaag and another person left the plane after a day and met a rescue party. The investigation concluded that neither technical faults with the aircraft nor pilot error played a part in the incident, and that it was not possible to predict the weather conditions which caused the icing. Flight The accident aircraft was a de Havilland DH-114 Heron 2B with registration LN-SUR, serial number 14093, and named Lars. It was purchased new by Braathens SAFE, and was registered on 8 February 1956.Hagby: 294 Herons had been introduced in Braathens SAFE's fleet in 1952 and remained in service until 1960.Tjomsland and Wilsberg: 64–65 Lars was insured by Lloyd's. Flight 253 was a scheduled morning service from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, with a nominal flight time of one and a half hours. It carried a crew of two and ten passengers.Tjomsland and Wilsberg: 111 Among the passengers was Rolf Kirkvaag, a radio host and journalist for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. He was at the time the channel's most popular host, specializing in quiz programs, and has been described as Norway's first national celebrity. The flight departed Værnes at 8:30. It climbed to a cruising altitude of 2,500 meters (8,000 ft) and passed Tolga Radio Beacon at 09:12. In the area around Røros, the aircraft started to experience icing, which quickly rose to levels that could not be handled by the ice protection system. The aircraft was further subject to a downdraft. The pilots therefore chose to turn around and return to Trondheim. However, the icing was so rapid that the aircraft lost altitude very quickly. The plane was also flying through a blizzard with poor visibility, making navigation difficult. In addition to adversely affecting aerodynamic lift, the ice covered the windshield and radio antenna, causing radio communication to be cut. The pilots were therefore not able to navigate properly, and were not aware that they were flying over the mountain. The aircraft hit Hummelfjell at 09:50 at an altitude of in the municipality of Tolga. The aircraft was traveling at the impact, striking the ground tail- first. The engines were broken off by the impact, while the aircraft continued to slide along the snow. The aircraft bounced once before settling in a snow dune, which limited the impact forces considerably and presumably saved many passengers' lives. Rescue Ten people survived the crash. The captain was killed in the crash, and a passenger died some time later of heart problems related to the stress of the accident. The accident occurred in an isolated area, in bad weather, and at a very inaccessible site for the search and rescue party. The passengers stayed at the aircraft for a day, waiting for rescue. Kirkvaag was aware of the dangers to the injured and frozen passengers if they should fall asleep. He introduced a roll-call every ten minutes, and Kirkvaag improvised a radio program to keep up spirits. The accident and rescue operations generated a large media interest, especially via radio, which was compounded by a celebrity being amongst the passengers. Rolf Kirkvaag in September 1955 The rescue site was covered in snow and fog, making the search and rescue operation very difficult. Visibility was so poor that the searchers would have had to stumble directly upon the aircraft to find it. It was estimated that there was about of visibility at the site. Searches with aircraft were carried out, but were futile, as they were not able to see the wreckage from the air. In addition, authorities at first did not know the location of the crash site. Initially, all that was known was that the plane was located somewhere between Trondheim and Oslo, probably in Østerdalen. Later, there came reports from the area around Hummelfjell that people had heard a great crash, and the search was subsequently concentrated in that area. The search was led by Police Inspector Oppegård. On 8 November, a team of twenty-eight people started search for the aircraft around Hummelfjell, based on reports of a loud sound in the area. They set up a base of operations at a farm at Brend, which was able to feed and house the entire group of military and volunteer personnel. Rescuers had two M29 Weasel tracked vehicles, but these were unusable. A search area of was then mapped out between Gråhøgda and Grøtvolen. Simultaneously, a group of Home Guard personnel were sent to the other, Atna side of the mountain to search. After spending about twenty-four hours at the accident site, and without any sign of the blizzard dying down, Kirkvaag— who had two fractures in his leg— and another passenger chose to go for help. Lacking skis, they were forced to walk through the deep snow. Kirkevaag later stated that he had left in a state of panic, not wanting to die at the crash site. The pair soon found a river bed, which they followed in the hopes of finding someone. Visibility remained poor, at about . However, the duo stumbled upon a two skiers from Hodalen, who happened to be tracking them. Kirkvaag later commented that he was so delirious that he thought he was out skiing and that the two wanted to pass, so he stepped aside. The skiers were able to alert rescue coordinators, and an initial rescue crew arrived at the site at 12:30, twenty-seven hours after the accident. It took hours to complete the rescue, and several people were carried out on stretchers made from parts of the aircraft. Investigation A commission was appointed to investigate the accident. Representatives from the Royal Norwegian Air Force and de Havilland inspected the wreckage on 11 November, concluding that the aircraft was a write-off. The investigative commission published a preliminary report on 20 November, and a final report was published on 9 May 1957. The commission rejected the notion that the aircraft did not have a sufficiently potent ice protection system, stating that Herons were equipped with a better system than comparable aircraft. It stated that no contemporary ice protections system would have been capable of de-icing the aircraft given the conditions. Members found no faults with the pilot's actions. They also recommended that airlines equip aircraft with additional first-aid and survival equipment. The commission found that the aircraft was subject to so much icing that even if it had steered clear of Hummelfjell, it would still have been forced to land within a short time, or it would have inevitably crashed. Icing happened extremely rapidly, and the commission found that the pilots' choice to turn back could not have happened earlier. It stated that the weather data that the pilots received at Værnes did not predict the conditions which led to the icing. However, it found that had the pilots conferred in person with a meteorologist concerning the weather along the whole route, the conditions may have been predicted in advance. The commission recommended that such procedures be developed. Flight 253 was the third write-off of a Heron and the second fatal accident of that type. The accident was Braathens SAFE's first fatal accident. Along with Flight 239 in 1972, which killed 40 people, they would be the only fatal accidents in the airline's history. A memorial has been erected at the crash site. Parts from Flight 253 were afterwards used to rebuild two other Herons: LN-NPI, damaged on 26 January 1957, and LN-SUL.

Boreholes are the circular walls made out of clay, dug into the earth to find water. In June 1974 archaeologists put the boreholes in order of stratigraphy so they can find out more about how the population disappeared that was once there. The stratigraphy helped in finding out why the population disappeared, which was not due by climatic changes but to an increase in drought.

Plot summary Basil, son of a father who values the family pedigree and who would not let him marry below his station, falls in love at first sight with a girl he sees on a bus. He follows her and discovers she is Margaret Sherwin, only daughter of a linen draper. He persuades her father to let him marry her secretly. He agrees on the condition, that, as his daughter is only seventeen, they live apart for the first year. At first the secret works, but then the mysterious Mannion, whose emotions cannot be read in his face, returns from abroad. On the last night of the year Basil follows Margaret and Mannion and discovers them in flagrante delicto. Basil attacks Mannion in the street and tries to murder him, but succeeds only in mutilating his face by pushing it into the fresh tarmacadam in the road. Mannion survives, recovers and swears revenge, and it is revealed that Basil's father indirectly caused Mannion's father to be hanged for forgery. Basil repudiates Margaret, but Sherwin threatens him with exposure unless he holds to his marriage. Basil confesses to his father, who disowns him, but his sister Clara stands by him. Basil's brother Ralph undertakes to buy Sherwin off, but meanwhile Margaret flees to Mannion, thereby acknowledging her guilt. Visiting Mannion in hospital, she catches typhus and dies. Basil, having been put on her track by Ralph, visits her on her deathbed. Basil flees from Mannion to Cornwall. The dénouement is worthy of Conan Doyle, set among whirlpools and cliffs near Lands End. Themes and Criticism In her introduction (Oxford World's Classics Edition), Dorothy Goldman applies psychoanalytic theories to argue that Basil and Mannion, Margaret and Clara, are each like opposite halves of the same person. A further doublet is between the active Ralph and the passive Basil, as the former notes in his dialogue. Mrs Sherwin, Margaret’s mother, is apparently feeble-minded and as such is the precursor of Sarah Leeson (The Dead Secret), Mrs Wragge (No Name) and other of Collins’ deranged woman characters - though she is astute enough to suspect Margaret and Mannion's guilty secret. One criticism of the book's plot is that it is highly coincidental that Mannion's father lost his life as a consequence of actions set in motion by Basil's father. The fact that the very woman Basil randomly follows is so closely connected to Basil, via Mannion, despite being a total stranger, can be considered to be a plot flaw.

I, part I, p. 99 on 1 June 1840 it was opened to Steventon, with three intermediate stations, the northernmost of which was Wallingford Road;MacDermot, vol. I, part I, p. 102 it was possibly named Moulsford originally, being renamed by December 1840.Butt 1995, pp. 165, 240 Wallingford Road station was located on the eastern side of the Reading–Wallingford main road (the present-day A329 road), about a mile to the north of Moulsford village, and slightly further from the village of Cholsey, which lies to the north. Being on the western side of the River Thames it was then in Berkshire; the boundaries were redrawn in 1974 placing the station site two miles inside present-day Oxfordshire. On 2 July 1866, a branch line to was opened by the Wallingford & Watlington Railway, and on the same day Wallingford Road station was renamed Moulsford.MacDermot, vol. II, pp. 42-43Mitchell & Smith, fig. 57 Whilst the junction for the branch was at Moulsford station, the branch line track ran parallel to the main line for three-quarters of a mile before curving away.Mitchell & Smith, figs. 57, 59 The Wallingford & Watlington Railway never reached the second-named town, and it was absorbed by the GWR in 1872.MacDermot, vol. II, p. 43 In 1892, during quadrupling of the main line, the junction for Wallingford was resited down the line to the north-west, closer to the point of divergence, and a new station built there. Moulsford station closed on 29 February 1892,Butt 1995, p. 165 being replaced the same day by the new station which was known as Cholsey and Moulsford,MacDermot, vol.

Background Grace Folashade Bent was born in 1960. She attended Ilesa Grammar School (Graduate Class of 1978). At the University of Calabar she was a students' union activist. She received a BA (Hons) in English and Literary Studies in 1998, and an MSc in Political Science and International Relations in 2003. She has a doctorate of Public Administration from Indiana State University, United States. Before entering the senate, Grace Folashade Bent was political adviser to the PDP National Chairman, Audu Ogbeh, Assistant Producer, NTA Kaduna, and Managing Director of Jack Ventures Nigeria. She has published a book titled Women in Inter Ethnic Marriages in Nigeria. According to some sources, Grace Folashade Bent was involved in obtaining fake degrees. Career After election in 2007 Grace Folashade Bent became chair of the Nigerian Senate Committee on Environment. In this role, she was involved in controversy over an extension of permission for gas flaring granted to oil companies by president Umaru Yar'Adua without consultation with the Senate. In March 2009, Senator Bent opposed the establishment of a Desert Control Commission on the basis that this would subsume or duplicate the functions of the national committee on ecological problems. The senate whip, Mahmud Kanti Bello, cautioned her not to drag the public hearing over the proposed commission into \\"undue arguments\\". In April 2009, following a visit to South Africa, Senator Bent sponsored a motion to issue a travel advice to all Nigerians traveling to South Africa to be wary of incessant attacks. In September 2009, Grace Folashade Bent wrote a formal letter to Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Senator Mohammed Adamu Aliero, protesting the excessive felling of trees for road construction. Bent competed in the PDP primaries to be the April 2011 candidate for Adamawa South Senator, but lost to Ahmed Hassan Barata. He received 738 votes to her 406 votes. Bent, who was said to have been favored by the PDP party leadership, later claimed that she had won a rerun primary. While the question was being reviewed, a judge ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to remove Barata's name from the list of candidates and replace it with Bent. Bent's claim was later rejected by the INEC, by the Federal High Court, Abuja and by the PDP's counsel. She speaks Yoruba language, including the Ijesa dialect.

It was created by the sitcom writing team of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, and it starred Paul Eddington (who was also starring in the BBC's Yes Minister at exactly the same time this sitcom went out), Nanette Newman and Henry McGee (who, likewise, also played straight man to Benny Hill at the same time). It was made by Thames Television for the ITV network. Plot Middle- aged and middle-class Timothy Love (played by Eddington) is a confirmed bachelor who is nonetheless happy with his marital status and his life; since he has a good job, plenty of money, the availability of girlfriends whenever he wants them, and cherished freedom. Until a mother-of-three, Judy (played by Newman) enters his life. Timothy will find Judy different to all the other women he has courted in the past; in contrast with all the others, Judy is the type of woman with which he feels he can 'settle down'. They become engaged, and Timothy's realising of the effort he has to do to change his life and do away with his old individualism will prove the main theme of the show. Judy and Timothy are married at the end of the first series, and in the second Timothy had to adapt to step-fathering Judy's children Charles (played by Nolan), Edward (played by Morrison) and Elizabeth (played by Gambold), as well as come to terms with his parents-in-law (played by March and Welsh), as well as taking care of Judy's Alsatian dog. Another important character in the show is Timothy's business partner Dennis Newberry (played by McGee) in their advertising agency, and who would good-naturedly offer 'help' (i.e. hindrance) Timothy in adapting to his life with Judy.

Last Cake Standing Last Cake Standing was a four- week competition for the title of the \\"Best Cake Artist of America\\" aired by Food Network. Each week, the competitors were given a task to complete in 24 hours. At the end of each task, one team was eliminated, until only the winner remained. In the initial Last Cake Standing competition in 2009, there were six teams, each headed by a chef: Michelle Bommarito (Ferndale, MI), Courtney Clark (Ann Arbor, MI), Mary Maher (Chicago, IL), James Rosselle (Los Angeles, CA), Elisa Strauss (New York, NY), and Bronwen Weber (Dallas, TX). For the first episode, the challengers' task was to create a cake that depicted their lives. The challenge winner was the Cake Girls. Their cake was about Mary and her life as an artist, and how it transformed into her edible art cake-making today. In the second episode, the five remaining challengers were given the task of creating a wedding cake in only eight hours. The competitors got to meet with the couple who the wedding cake was being created for, but only for a short period of time. The newlyweds got the choose who their winner was and used the winning cake at their wedding reception. In the third episode, the four remaining challengers had to create a superhero cake. The night before, each team was asked to create a superhero of their own. When the challenge came that next morning, they didn't have their usual aides that they had had for the previous challenges. Instead, the remaining four competitors were split into two teams, with their fellow competitors taking the place of separate aides. Each team had to create a superhero cake that incorporated both of the competitors' ideas. The winner was again Cake Girls. At the end of the show, the losing teams had to have a \\"cake-off\\" to determine who would advance into the finale. The fourth episode was the final episode, and the three remaining competitors were given a 24-hour cake challenge. They had to create a 5-foot \\"Sweet 16\\" birthday cake for a set of sextuplets. Not only did the cakes have to individually represent each of the sextuplets, but the cakes also had to be delivered to the party within a time frame. The winner of the challenge was once again the Cake Girls, who were granted the title of \\"Best Cake Artist of America\\" in addition to their $50,000 winnings.

The Emperor hoped that Frederik, as a full nephew, would be favourable to Habsburg interests in the bishopric of Utrecht. The states of Utrecht, however, were on an independent course and approached Duke Charles of Guelders. Frederik attempted to act strongly, but the faction-struggles became too much for him. When it was revealed in 1514 that he was planning to relinquish the bishopric to a candidate of King Louis XII of France, he lost the support of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who forced him to resign on 9 May 1517. Charles then managed to get Philip of Burgundy elected. After his death, Frederik was interred in the church of Baden-Baden.

Thomas de Thomon was the author of Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns on the spit of Vasilievsky Island in Saint Petersburg and the first building of the Odessa Theatre, destroyed by fire in 1873. Thomas de Thomon, graduate of the French Academy in Rome, \\"imported\\" the high classicism practiced by this school in 1780s into Russia and thus contributed to the formation of Russian national variant of neoclassicism practiced during the reign of Alexander I.Shvidkovsky, p. 297 Biography Jean-François Thomas was born in a third estate family in Paris and has demonstrated talents in graphic arts since early childhood. His early works, preserved in the archive of Jean-Claude Richard, were influenced by Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Hubert Robert.Shuisky 2008, p. 213 At the age of 17 Thomas was admitted to the class of Julien-David Le Roy at the Académie royale d'architecture, and trained there along with Karl von Moreaux, Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine.Shuisky 2008, p. 214 All his attempts to win a state scholarship for a study tour of Italy failed, and in 1785 he left for Rome on his own account, and attended the classes of the French Academy in Rome as a stowaway along with legitimate students. His squatting in Rome continued for years; Thomas risked being expelled from the Academy had it not been for the patronage of François-Guillaume Ménageot. Thomas returned to France in 1789 and was hired by Charles, Comte d'Artois, however, the employment was cut short by the French Revolution. He left the country again and travelled through Italy, Austria and Poland, \\"acquiring\\" the noble style of Thomas de Thomon at some point in early 1790s.Shuisky, p. 215 Dmitry Shvidkovsky wrote that, quite likely, emigration resulted from Thomas's own political allegiance to monarchy(he was \\"an ardent royalist and a fervent Catholic\\" throughout his life) and practical inability \\"to realize architectural dreams of the last years of the Ancien Régime\\" in revolutionary France.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 296 His first tangible work of the period, rebuilding the gallery of Łańcut Castle for the Lubomirski family, instantly elevated him into the circle of leading architects of Eastern Europe. In 1794 he was hired by House of Esterházy in Vienna; at least two of his building, a school in Vienna and a bathhouse in Eisenstadt, survived to date in Austria.Shuisky, p. 216 Earlier, most likely in 1792, he met with Russian ambassador to Vienna, prince Dmitry Golitsyn; in 1798 Thomas de Thomon accepted invitation from his brother Alexander, then living in Moscow. Russian Empire at that time was closed to all Frenchmen in fear of revolutionary ideas. Thomas de Thomon sneaked into the country through Hamburg and Riga, assuming a persona of a Swiss citizen, native of Berne.Shuisky, p. 217 Monument in Poltava Thomas de Thomon initially worked for the Golytsins in their country residences and later relocated to Saint Petersburg; on January 30, 1802 he was hired by the Imperial government to rebuild Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The project that started as a modest refit soon expanded into a full-scale rebuild to Thomon's own draft. It was structurally completed in one year; Thomas de Thomon remained its architect until the fire of January 1, 1811. In 1804 Thomas de Thomon applied to an architectural contest to design naval warehouses on Matisov Island in Saint Petersburg; the resulting contract, completed in 1807, was split among three competing architects: facades were built to Thomas de Thomon's design while floorplans and construction management were handled by his rivals.Shuisky, p. 218 The buildings were demolished in 1914, Lev Rudnev reused their stone blocks for a monument on the Field of Mars. In 1807–1809 Thomas de Thomon supervised construction of the monument to Paul I of Russia in Pavlovsk. The contract was won in an open contest against Andrey Voronikhin, Andreyan Zakharov and Pietro Gonzaga.Shuisky, p. 219 Another monument by Thomas de Thomon, a column commemorating centennial of the Battle of Poltava, was erected in Poltava in 1805–1811.Shuisky, p. 220 In 1806–1809 he built three monumental fountains around Pulkovo Heights, one to design by Voronikhin and two of his own. Two of them were later relocated to downtown Saint Petersburg (to Sennaya Square and Kazan Cathedral Square).Shuisky, p. 221 His best known work, Old Stock Exchange on the spit of Vasilyevsky Island, was completed in 1805–1810 to a design approved shortly before the death of Paul of Russia; Thomon's drafts were preferred to earlier 1781 proposal by Giacomo Quarenghi,Shvidkovsky 2007, pp. 295–296 that was suspended in 1784. Quarenghi placed his Exchange on the southern side of the island, facing the Palace Embankment. Thomas de Thomon radically moved his building on the island's axis, producing a highly symmetrical ensemble tying together the island and both sides of the Neva River, from the Winter Palace to the Peter and Paul Fortress.Shuisky, p. 223–224 Thomon died in 1813 after an accidental fall from the scaffolding of the Bolshoi Theatre, then being restored after a fire. Critical assessment Igor Grabar, analyzing the difference between Italian and French versions of neoclassicism in Russia, considered Carlo Rossi and Thomas de Thomon the key figures of these branches of the same style. Thomas de Thomon was the principal source for French classicism in Russia, complementing utopian fantasies of Claude Nicolas Ledoux with \\"a new trait that never appeared before – a serious, well-considered understanding, perhaps less dexterity but more depth.\\"Schmidt 1989, p. 196 Grabar noted that Thomas de Thomon apparently \\"borrowed\\" the sweeping shape of the Exchange from the stylistic experiments of the French architectural competitions hosted by Académie royale d'architecture. Yet, he continued, original French designs were never intended for execution in stone; even their authors regarded them as nothing more than an exercise in draftsmanship. Unlike them, Thomas de Thomon \\"retained the sacred gift of insanity for the sake of beauty\\"Russian: \\"Всё ещё не утратил священного дара безумствовать во имя красоты\\" – quote in Lisovsky, p. 56 and dared to actually build his ideal of beauty in stone. \\"He was not a colossus as some represent him now, he was not a Palladio and not even a Rastrelli. Russia has seen greater architects before and after him. But he was a Prometheus, who, having stolen the flame of new beauty from the gods in France, brought it to Russia.\\"Igor Grabar, translation as in: Schmidt 1989, p. 56  In culture  In June 2011, Russian artist Alexander Taratynov installed a life-size statue of Thomas de Thomon in Saint Petersburg. The statue is part of The Architects, a bronze sculptural group depicting the great architects of Russian Empire as commissioned by Gazprom and installed in Alexander Park. In 2018, Taratynov admitted he used a picture he found on Wikipedia to base the statue on, and that it was actually an image of the Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson – Taratynov blamed Wikipedia for the error but also himself for not checking with a historian to verify it was accurate.

This is a list of Northumberland Fusiliers battalions in World War I. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, the Northumberland Fusiliers, a fusilier infantry regiment of the British Army, consisted of 7 battalions, eventually expanding to 52 battalions, although not all existed at the same time, of which 29 served overseas. It was the second largest infantry regiment of the British Army during World War I, surpassed only by the 88 battalions of the London Regiment. The Northumberland Fusiliers earned 67 battle honours and was awarded five Victoria Crosses, but at the cost of over 16,000 soldiers killed in action, and many thousands wounded. The Northumberland Fusiliers mostly saw action in the main theatre of war, engaged in static trench warfare on the Western Front in Belgium and France, but also participated in fighting on the Macedonian front, the Gallipoli Campaign, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Italian Front. Introduction Pre-war At the outbreak of the First World War, the Northumberland Fusiliers consisted of seven battalions: * the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Regular Armyin common with all line infantry regiments of the British Army at this time, one was at home (1st Battalion at Portsmouth) and the other was overseas (2nd Battalion at Sabathu, India) * the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion of the Special Reserve (S.R.)the former Northumberland Light Infantry Regiment of Militia that was transferred to the Special Reserve by Haldane's military reforms in 1908 * and the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Battalions of the Territorial Force (T.F.)these formed the Territorial Force's Northumberland Brigade of the Northumbrian Division. Expansion The expansion in battalions mostly came through two sources: the duplication of the Territorial Force battalions and the formation of Kitchener's New Armies. Of the 45 battalions raised during the war, 10 were Territorial Force and 27 were New Army. Territorial Force In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line units. When 2nd Line battalions were formed, the 1st Line took on a fractional designation so, for example, 4th Battalion became 1/4th Battalion (first fourth) and its 2nd Line was designated 2/4th Battalion (second fourth); in due course the 3rd Line was formed as the 3/4th Battalion (third fourth). In the summer of 1915, personnel of 2nd and 3rd line battalions who had not volunteered for overseas service were formed into Provisional Battalions. They were used to form Provisional Brigades and later Home Service divisions (71st, 72nd, and 73rd Divisions); on 1 January 1917 they became numbered battalions of line infantry regiments. In the case of the Northumberland Fusiliers, the 21st and 22nd Provisional Battalions became the 35th and 36th Battalions (T.F.) of the regiment. New Army Kitchener was one of the few people in 1914 to realize that the war was not going to be a short one; he believed that it would last three years and would require an army of 70 divisions. He eschewed the Territorial Forcepartly due to the limitations imposed by its terms of service but also due to the poor impression he formed when observing the French Territorials in the Franco-Prussian Warand did not make use of the framework envisioned by Haldane. He launched his appeal for 100,000 volunteers on 7 August 1914 to form a New Army of six divisions (and support units) and within a few days this target had been reached; by the end of September, half a million volunteers had come forward to form the New Armies. Each of the 69 line infantry regiments raised one battalion for the First (K1) and for the Second New Armies (K2) designated as Service battalions and numbered after the existing Territorial Force battalions (so 8th and 9th (Service) Battalions for the Northumberland Fusiliers). This rigid structure did not take account of the differing ability of regiments to raise troops based upon the population of their recruiting areas. Therefore, the Third New Army (K3) had a much higher proportion of battalions from the more populous north of England, notably Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland (10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th (Service) Battalions). The Fourth New Army (K4) was formed from men of the Reserve and Special Reserve battalions which were over establishment. Originally formed into the 30th35th Divisions, these were broken up so the battalions could train recruits and send drafts to the first three New Armies. The regiment raised the 15th (Reserve) Battalion in this manner. While the first four New Armies were being raised, a number of units were also being raised by committees in cities and towns, and by other organizations and individualsthe Pals battalions. These were housed, clothed and fed by their committees until the War Office took them over in 1915 and the raisers' expenses were refunded. These units formed the Fifth and Sixth New Armies (later called the new Fourth and Fifth New Armies when the original Fourth New Army was broken up). The Northumberland Fusiliers raised the largest number of pals battalions of any regiment, notably including the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish Brigades: 16th (Newcastle), 17th (NER Pioneers), 18th (1st Tyneside Pioneers), 19th (2nd Tyneside Pioneers), 20th (1st Tyneside Scottish), 21st (2nd Tyneside Scottish), 22nd (3rd Tyneside Scottish), 23rd (4th Tyneside Scottish), 24th (1st Tyneside Irish), 25th (2nd Tyneside Irish), 26th (3rd Tyneside Irish), and 27th (4th Tyneside Irish) battalions. The locally recruitedpalsbattalions formed depot companies and in 1915 these were grouped into local reserve battalions to provide reinforcements for their parents. The regiment formed 28th, 29th (Tyneside Scottish), 30th (Tyneside Irish), 31st, 32nd, 33rd (Tyneside Scottish), and 34th (Tyneside Irish) Reserve Battalions. Others The regiment formed eight other battalions. The 37th (Home Service) Battalion was formed in April 1918 to replace the 36th Battalion when it moved to the Western Front. The 38th Battalion was formed in June 1918, but was absorbed into the 22nd Battalion before the end of the month. The regiment raised three Garrison Battalions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) of officers and men unfit for active service but considered fit for garrison duty at home and overseas, thereby releasing fitter troops for front line service. In May 1917, the Training Reserve was reorganized with the battalions becoming more specialized in their training. Young Soldier Battalions took in recruits aged 18 years and one month and, after basic training, posted them to one of two linked Graduated Battalions. Eventually, 23 Young Soldier Battalions and 46 Graduated Battalions were formed. On 27 October 1917, these were allocated to 23 infantry regiments and thereby the Northumberland Fusiliers gained the 51st (Graduated), 52nd (Graduated) and 53rd (Young Soldier) Battalions. Reserve battalions A number of reserve battalions served during the war. They recruited and trained drafts for the active service units and were designated by use of (Reserve) after the battalion number. These had a number of different origins and had a variety of fates. Special Reserve battalions The Childers Reforms of 1881 created regimental districts, each allocated a two-battalion regiment, usually bearing a \\"county\\" title. Existing two-battalion regiments of foot (1st to 25th inclusive) were redesignated, whereas the single-battalion foot regiments were paired to become the 1st or 2nd battalions of the new regiments. At the same time the existing militia and rifle volunteer units of the district became battalions of their regiments, the militia numbered after the regularsthus 3rd (Millitia) Battalion, 4th (Millitia) Battalion, etc.and the volunteers in a separate sequence1st Volunteer Battalion, 2nd Volunteer Battalion, etc. As the 5th (Northumberland) (Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot already had two battalions, it simply became the Northumberland Fusiliers as the county regiment of Northumberland. The Northumberland Light Infantry Militia became the 3rd (Militia) Battalion and the rifle volunteers formed the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the regiment. Further reforms by Haldane in 1908 saw the militia transferred to a new \\"Special Reserve\\" as \\"Reserve\\"3rd battalionsor \\"Extra Reserve\\"4th and subsequentbattalions. The volunteer battalions were renumbered in the same sequence as the regulars and millitia. Hence, the 3rd (Millitia) Battalion became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion and the volunteers became the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers. Almost all of the Special Reserve battalions remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war, training replacements and providing drafts to the regular battalions. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion remained part of the regiment as a training unit until the end of the war. 2nd Reserve battalions On 8 October 1914, each Reserve and Extra Reserve battalion of the line infantry regiments were instructed to form a Service battalion. The battalions thus raised, including the 15th (Service) Battalion, were used to form the divisions of Kitchener's Fourth New Army. The divisions were never fully formed; the need for trained reinforcements for the first three New Armies meant that they were broken up and the infantry battalions were used to provide and train reinforcements. On 10 April 1915, the infantry battalions became reserve formations to be known as 2nd Reserve battalions (in the sense that they were second to the original Reserve and Extra Reserve battalions). The 15th Battalion became the 15th (Reserve) Battalion and provided replacements for the 8th – 14th battalions. The introduction of conscription caused a reorganisation of the reserve battalions as the regimental system could not cope with the number of new recruits. A new, centralized, system was put in place, called The Training Reserve. On 1 September 1916, the 15th Battalion became part of the new organisation. Local Reserve battalions The locally recruited Service battalions of the Fifth and Sixth New Armiesthe Pals battalionsformed depot companies and in 1915 these were grouped into Local Reserve battalions to provide reinforcements for their parents. Like the 2nd Reserve battalions, they became part of the Training Reserve on 1 September 1916. Territorial Force Reserve battalions Almost all Territorial Force battalions had formed a 3rd Linedesignated with the fractional 3/by June 1915; they supplied reinforcements to their parent 1st and 2nd Lines. In the autumn of 1915 they were brought together in 14 Third Line Groups, one for each of the pre-war T.F. divisionsthose of the Northumberland Fusiliers joining the Northumbrian Third Line Group, along with those of the East Yorkshire Regiment, the Green Howards, and the Durham Light Infantry. In April 1916 they dropped the fractional designation and became Reserve Battalions T.F. On 1 September 1916 the reserve territorial battalions of each regiment were amalgamated into a single unit (or two units in certain large regiments, for example the Manchester Regiment's 5th and 8th Reserve Battalions). At the same time, the Third Line Groups were renamed as Reserve Brigades T.F. The Northumbrian Reserve Brigade T.F. commanded 4th (Reserve) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, 4th (Reserve) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, 4th (Reserve) Battalion, Green Howards, and 5th (Reserve) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry in the Hornsea area as part of the Humber Garrison. Along with the Special Reserve battalions, the T.F. Reserve battalions remained as regimental reserves. New recruits were posted to them first until they were up to strength, then to the Training Reserve. When drafts were needed for the overseas units, they were taken first from the regimental reserves; if there were insufficient trained replacements then recourse was made to the Training Reserve.

Designed as a 21st-century reinterpretation of the traditional opera house, the Winspear seats 2,200 (with a capacity of 2,300) in a traditional horseshoe configuration. The facility is the home of The Dallas Opera (which until the 2008/2009 season performed at the Music Hall at Fair Park) and the Texas Ballet Theater. The AT&T; Performing Arts Center also produces original programming and partners with local and national organizations to present a wide range of other cultural performances at the venue. These offerings include music, dance, Broadway shows, concerts and lectures. The Winspear Opera House includes the Nancy Hamon Education and Recital Hall, a space that can be used for smaller performances seating audiences up to 200, as well as classes, rehearsals, meetings and events. History Western view of the Winspear Opera House. The Annette Strauss Artist Square will be housed under this section of the building's portico Groundbreaking for the AT&T; Performing Arts Center and Winspear Opera House was held in October 2006. The venue was designed by Foster and Partners (principal architect: Spencer de Grey) and made possible in part by a $42-million gift from Margot and Bill Winspear, for whom the facility is named. The London firm Sound Space Design (principal acoustician: Robert Essert) developed the acoustical design of the opera house and the acoustics were engineered specifically for performances of opera and musical theater. Theatre planning and theatre equipment design were by Theatre Projects Consultants. The stages were also equipped with appropriate flooring for performances of ballet and other forms of dance. The opera house was presented to the public with tours and performances during the center's opening week, October 12 – 18, 2009. The first opera performance took place on October 23, 2009 with Verdi's Otello, conducted by Graeme Jenkins. Design Features Auditorium and chandelier during opening night The Annette and Harold Simmons Signature Glass Façade wraps around the building, creating a transparency between the opera house and the surrounding Performance Park. An wide section of the glass façade is retractable to a height of , literally opening up the Grand Lobby, Cafe and Box Circle-level Restaurant to Performance Park. The Grand Portico, radiating from the opera house on all sides, provides shade over of the Performance Park. The solar canopy's louvers are arranged at fixed angles following the path of the sun. By eliminating most direct sunlight on the façade and by creating a cooler microclimate around the building, the canopy significantly reduce the energy requirements of the Winspear Opera House. In May 2009 artist Guillermo Kuitca was commissioned to design the stage curtain. The design abstracts the seating plan for the Winspear's Margaret McDermott Performance Hall and reproduces this image onto the curtain itself. A key design feature is the 318-rod chandelier located inside the performance hall, named The Moody Foundation Chandelier. The chandelier hangs 50 feet below the ceiling. Starting Friday, June 28, 2013, the traditional pre-performance ascent of The Moody Chandelier has been accompanied by an exclusively adapted piece “The Light” by American composer Philip Glass.Chandelier in Winspear Named After $5M Gift From the Moody Foundation Once retracted into the ceiling, it leaves the impression of a star lit night, as each rod has the ability to \\"twinkle.\\" The acrylic rods are illuminated by three primary color LEDs which allows the chandelier to be lit in virtually any color.

She was Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1832 to 1844 as the second wife of Duke Ernest I. As such, she was the stepmother of Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. Early life Marie was born on 17 September 1799, the eldest child of Duke Alexander of Württemberg and his wife Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She had two younger surviving brothers, Duke Alexander and Duke Ernest. The Kingdom of Württemberg, as it was known from 1806 onward, was a prominent entity in Germany on the level of Prussia, Bavaria, and Saxony, with connections to the English and Russian royal families. Marie was raised at Schloss Fantaisie in Bayreuth. As her father was a general in the Russian army, and later governor of Belarus, Marie lived from 1802 to 1832 at Jelgava (modern day Latvia) and in a St. Petersburg palace. Marriage In Coburg on 23 December 1832, Marie became the second wife of 48-year-old Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest had been eager to find a new bride after the death of his first, estranged wife, Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. While Ernest initially sought a wife of high status, he found that his age and poor reputation limited his choices. He settled for Marie, who was thirty-three years old and his niece – uncle-niece relationships were by this time becoming discouraged among European royalty, and Marie was the daughter of Ernest's sister Antoinette. As a result of this union, Marie became stepmother of Ernest II and Prince Albert, future husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Marie was also their first-cousin. Ernest and his sons met Marie at Thalwitz Castle and accompanied her to the duchies to begin her marriage. She would maintain a happy relationship until death with both of her stepsons, becoming godmother (in absentia) of Victoria and Albert's first son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (King Edward VII) in 1841. Historian Gillian Gill describes Marie as a \\"severe and melancholy lady\\". Marie and Ernest would have no children, and the two quickly grew apart, largely living on separate estates. By 1843 Marie had adopted a child of \\"humble parentage\\", though Albert cautioned her to avoid giving it hopeless aspirations to rank. He wrote, \\"I wish you more success than generally attends the education of poor children of the lower ranks by persons of our own.\\" While Albert referred to her as \\"dear mama\\" in his letters to her, Marie opted not to attend several important events in her stepsons' lives, such as their confirmation and Queen Victoria's coronation (Marie cited inclement weather for the former). Albert and Marie maintained correspondence throughout their lives, which has helped historians gain a better understanding of their relationship. Marie was interested in literature, music, theatre, and art. The newly built Landestheater Coburg was opened on her 41st birthday. From 1842, Franz Liszt often visited her. In 1836, she assumed the management of the Gothaer Marien-Institut, a private educational institution for girls. On May 3, 1842, she donated 2000 thalers for establishing an refuge for young children in Coburg, modeled on a similar institute in the capital, Gotha. The \\"Marienschulstiftung\\" (Marie School Foundation) began operation that same year and has run a Kindergarten since, later also a \\"Kinderkrippe\\" (for smaller children), as an independent foundation. The institution has been housed since 1869 in a building that Marie owned, \\"Park 1\\", in Coburg. Widowhood Ernest I died in 1844, and the dowager duchess chose as her dower residence Schloss Reinhardsbrunn, Schloss Friedrichsthal, and Schloss Friedenstein, all in Gotha. She opted to return to Coburg mainly to meet with her visiting English relatives. Marie died at Schloss Friedenstein on 24 September 1860, the year before Albert's death. She is buried in the ducal mausoleum of the ' in Coburg. Ancestry References Notes ;Works cited * Bachmann, Gertraude (1999).

The resort was a real family destination with plenty of activities for kids and adults alike; however, Jews were not welcome, or \\"for restricted clientele\\", as the brochure explained in euphemistic terms. Ellinor Village had its own shopping center and amusement park and was just steps from the beach. In 1951, Merrill Ellinor purchased what is today the golf course at Oceanside Country Club. The golf course was originally part of the Ormond Hotel (owned by John Anderson) and adjacent to John D. Rockefeller's winter home; \\"The Casements\\". In 1954 the Mrs. America contest was held at Ellinor Village, which attracted nationwide publicity. The opening of the Rockefeller Memorial Bridge was also in 1954.

The original cupola from the hotel sits in a riverside park across from the condos. The history of Ellinor Village is rich, and the duplexes and triplexes that the Ellinors built have been modernized and renovated into beautiful homes and rental units. Ellinor Village was sold to Milton Pepper, a local developer in the late 1950s. Pepper was also the man who bought the Ormond Hotel and then built the Ormond Heritage after the city of Ormond Beach would not let him restore the historic hotel.

History  The company had been represented during the BMW Sauber takeover by Lionel Fischer, a Swiss national, and two of its representative directors on the Notts County board, Peter and Nathan Willett, who appointed Sven-Goran Eriksson as director of football. On 27 November 2009 The Guardian revealed that Sven-Goran Eriksson had demanded immediate payment of the multimillion-pound sum under the terms of his recruitment by Notts County. German automotive conglomerate BMW were advised during the planning phases of Qadbak's takeover by leading British investment bank Rothschild, whose managing director Meyrick Cox had stated that Qadbak was \\"a wholly reputable organisation\\".

In a response to the press release, Anwar Shafi, a member of the Shafi family, denied that he had a connection with the club or an investment in Qadbak. The club subsequently released a further statement, purporting to be from the Hyat/Shafi Family Trust and its head, Sardar Hyat, confirming its involvement with Qadbak and Notts County. On 20 October 2009, the Football League announced that Notts County's owners had met its \\"fit and proper persons\\" regulations, and that while their structure was \\"complicated\\" and featured \\"both offshore entities and discretionary trusts\\", it had provided \\"extensive disclosure\\" to the League on their ownership structure.

In general, state police officers, known as state troopers, perform functions that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the county sheriff (Vermont being a notable exception), such as enforcing traffic laws on state highways and interstate expressways, overseeing the security of the state capitol complex, protecting the governor, training new officers for local police forces too small to operate an academy and providing technological and scientific services. They support local police and help to coordinate multi- jurisdictional task force activity in serious or complicated cases in those states that grant full police powers statewide. A general trend has been to bring all of these agencies under a state-level Department of Public Safety. Additionally, they may serve under different state departments, such as the Highway Patrol under the state Department of Transportation and the marine patrol under the Department of Natural Resources. Twenty-three U.S. states use the term \\"State Police.\\" Forty-nine states have a State Police agency or its equivalent, with Hawaii being the only state with a Sheriff Division of the Hawaii Department of Public Safety with statewide jurisdiction. History The Texas Rangers are the earliest form of state law enforcement in the United States, first organized by Stephen F. Austin in 1823. The original ranger force consisted of ten men charged with protecting settlers from Native American attacks. Though the rangers of this era are today considered law enforcement officers, they rarely wore badges and were little more than volunteers; the Mexican military was officially in charge of law enforcement in the then-Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. The Rangers later served as a paramilitary force on the U.S.-Mexico border and in several armed military conflicts, including the Texas Revolution, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War. They continued to fill basic law enforcement and frontier protection roles until the close of the \\"wild west\\" era. In the early 1900s, they transformed into a criminal investigative agency. The history and legacy of the Texas Rangers has spawned numerous depictions in popular culture. The colloquial image of a Texas Ranger \\"always [getting] their man\\" has likewise made the Rangers a revered and highly competitive agency within law enforcement, with fewer than 1 in 100 applicants being considered for a single position. The Pennsylvania State Police force emerged in the aftermath of the anthracite mine strike of 1902, in Pennsylvania. The passage of legislation on May 2, 1905, did not provoke controversy because it was quietly rushed through the mine-owner dominated legislature, but the strike-breaking role of the new police elicited strong opposition from organized labor, who likened them to the repressive Russian cossacks under the tsar. President Theodore Roosevelt, himself a former President of the New York City Police Commission, noted that the Pennsylvania State Police were intended to replace the \\"infamous\\" Coal and Iron Police, the private company police used to counter union attacks on private property: Roosevelt's assertions notwithstanding, the Iron and Coal Police continued to operate in increasing numbers into the 1930s. The formation of the New York State Police force on April 11, 1917, was done amidst controversy and public debate, and the legislation creating it passed by only one vote. Proponents of a proposal to establish the New York State Police depicted state police as the policemen-soldiers of an impartial state in labor disputes, and saw in them \\"no gendarmerie, no carabinieri,\\" intimating that labor's opposition was \\"un-American\\". Instead, they were to be more like the trooper police of Australia, both of which had a much more respectable reputation than the maligned forces evoked by trade unionists. Outside of Pennsylvania, the new state police were also established to free up the National Guard from strikebreaking duties, which was extensive in the later 19th century and early decades of the 20th. The strikebreaking demands on the New York state police decreased over time and their mandate modernized with the creation of the inter-state highway system and proliferation of the automobile. While the early \\"state troopers\\", as the name implies, were mounted troops, by mid-century they were fully motorized police forces.. Two years later on June 19, 1919 the newly formed West Virginia State Police (WVSP) was formed to combat and put down the in the coal and mining industry. 3 West Virginia State Troopers were killed in the two years it took to put down the uprising. The WVSP was also used very heavily during the prohibition era for hunting down and destroying moonshine stills/operations throughout the mountainous and rural areas of West Virginia, which resulted in some deaths of WVSP Troopers. WVSP is the 4th oldest State Police agency in the United States of America. Governor John Jacob Cornwell was insistent upon having a State Police force which he said, \\"was mandatory in order for him to uphold the laws of our state.\\" Part of the compromise was the name of the organization: \\"West Virginia Department of Public Safety\\" was the official name until 1995 when the name was changed to \\"West Virginia State Police\\" during the legislative session. The federal government in the 1920s was generally distrustful of southern states establishing state police, fearing the agencies would be used to oppress black citizens from voting and exercising their civil rights. Additionally, southern states were non-union and had little need for such state police, as did some northern mining states. During this time the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was also on a resurgence. In response, the southern states established agencies to regulate the increasing problems related to motor vehicles and highway safety, such as licensure compliance, vehicle registration, speed enforcement, vehicular equipment safety, vehicle insurance laws and drunken driving. Over time, these agencies were vested with general police powers, but remained focused primarily on highway and vehicular law enforcement. North Carolina for example established a DMV motor vehicle theft investigations unit in 1921 to combat a rising problem with car theft, but the state realized a need for a larger, uniformed highway patrol agency to solely enforce traffic laws statewide. Local NC sheriffs did not have the personnel, resources or training to do so during that era, but did not want their powers usurped by a per-se state police agency. Thus, the NC State Highway Patrol was established on July 1, 1929. Its original command staff was sent to the Pennsylvania State Police Academy for training. Upon completion, these lieutenants and a captain returned to NC and started the SHP with a training camp for new recruits at Camp Glenn, a WW1 abandoned army post in Morehead City. Chartered to enforce traffic laws only, in the early 1930s the NCSHP had added in its charter that it had powers to deal with among other crimes, bank robbery. This was done at the request of the federal government, so that local states could assist the FBI during the rash of bank robberies in the gangster era of the Great Depression in the 1930s. During this time, the FBI issued 100 spare Thompson .45 caliber sub-machineguns to the NCSHP, to prepare NC troopers to help the FBI combat the rash epidemic of bank robberies at the time. The expected scores of bank robberies never occurred in NC, instead being an epidemic confined to the sparsely-populated and vast areas of the Southwest, Midwest and Great Plains states from Texas to Minnesota. The guns were kept in the main SHP armory in Raleigh and never issued. The weapons were returned to the Federal government in the mid-1980s. In 1919 Virginia established a motor vehicle enforcement agency and it was established as state police in 1932. Kentucky established a highway patrol in 1935 and it was established as state police in 1948, but these states, located on the border of the previous Civil War south, were more under the watchful eye of the federal government than were deeper southern states. The only deep south, former Confederate State to have a true state police agency is Louisiana. The Louisiana State Police also first started out as a highway patrol agency but in 1936 it was established as a state police, at the desire and influence of the late Governor Huey Long, who used the troopers as a powerful body guard force. Long is often called one of the most powerful Democratic politicians in US history. Types of state police agencies In many states, the state police are known by different names: the various terms used are \\"State Police\\", \\"Highway Patrol\\", \\"State Highway Patrol\\", \\"State Patrol\\", and \\"State Troopers\\". However, the jurisdictions and functions of these agencies are usually the same, regardless of title. Some agencies' names are actually misnomers with respect to the work regularly done by their members. All but two state police entities use the term \\"trooper\\" to refer to their commissioned members; California and New Mexico are the lone exceptions, using the term \\"officer\\" instead. New Mexico has commissioned and certified volunteer State Troopers in the New Mexico Mounted Patrol, a self-governing state agency, separate from the New Mexico State Police. (Until 2015, Arizona also used \\"officer\\", but has since switched to \\"trooper\\".) These titles are usually historical and do not necessarily describe the agency's function or jurisdiction. Colloquial or slang terms for a state trooper may include \\"troop,\\" \\"statey,\\" \\"stater,\\" or—in trucker slang—\\"Smokey\\", \\"full-grown bear\\", or \\"Polar Bear\\" if the police vehicle is all white. Some regional slang terms also exist for specific agencies. Alaska and Arkansas are the only states with both a highway patrol and a state police. The Alaska Highway Patrol is a bureau of the Alaska State Troopers while the Arkansas Highway Patrol is the uniformed patrol division of the Arkansas State Police. A separate Arkansas Highway Police exists as part of the Arkansas Department of Transportation but exists as a work-zone and commercial vehicle enforcement agency. The New Hampshire Highway Patrol, also a commercial vehicle enforcement agency, has since been merged into the New Hampshire State Police as Troop G - Commercial Vehicle Enforcement. The California State Police (CSP) was a division of the California Department of General Services, and was a security police agency which merged with the California Highway Patrol in 1995; following this, the California Highway Patrol assumed security police responsibilities in addition to its highway patrol duties. Pennsylvania formed a State Highway Patrol in 1923 within the Department of Highways to enforce the vehicle laws of Pennsylvania's burgeoning highway system. The State Highway Patrol was merged with the State Police on June 29, 1937. The Texas State Police was formed during the administration of Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis on July 22, 1870, to combat crime associated with Reconstruction statewide in Texas. It worked primarily against racially based crimes, and included black police officers, which caused howls of protest from former slave owners (and future segregationists). It was dissolved by order of the legislature on April 22, 1873. The Texas Highway Patrol currently performs statewide police functions. State police An Oregon State Police vehicle (2012) Though many forces use the term \\"state police,\\" its meaning is not consistent from agency to agency. In many places, it is a full-service law enforcement agency which responds to calls for service, investigates criminal activity, and regularly patrols high-crime areas. On the other hand, some state police agencies, despite the name, are strictly tasked with traffic enforcement, though their members usually retain full police powers; the Arkansas State Police is an example.

Highway patrol A California Highway Patrol vehicle (2015) :See also: Several agencies use the term \\"highway patrol,\\" though this name can be misleading in some cases. Some highway patrol agencies are, as their name implies, dedicated to enforcing state traffic laws on the highways; a few are full-service state police agencies which regularly respond to calls and conduct inner-city policing functions; and yet others are a bridge, focusing primarily on traffic enforcement but providing general policing services when and where necessary. Their primary concern is enforcing motor vehicle laws, but they also assist with other incidents. These include riots, prison disturbances, labor related disturbances, and providing security at sporting events.

Because of its geography, it is impossible to use roads to get from one local/municipal jurisdiction to another. As a consequence, Hawaii is the only state that does not have a specifically named state police/highway patrol force. Highway patrol functions are instead carried out within each of the state's five counties, which are served by four police forces (Kalawao County is administered as part of Maui County): *Hawai‘i County Police Department *Honolulu Police Department *Kauai County Police Department *Maui County Police Department The Department of the Attorney General includes an Investigations Division which assists the department’s civil, criminal, and administrative cases.State of Hawaii Attorney General's Investigations Division The Sheriff Division of the Hawaii Department of Public Safety performs the security policing tasks usually undertaken by a dedicated state police force or Capitol police agency, such as airport security, counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, executive protection and other specialized duties since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, in addition to providing bailiffs and corrections officers to the judicial apparatus. The television series Hawaii Five-O featured a fictional state police detective unit in Hawaii. This was not a uniformed police force, but instead functioned more as a state bureau of investigation.

often these are umbrella organizations which provide oversight and coordination over various state or territory-level police agencies, such as State Police, State Bureau of Investigation, or Highway Patrols. * State Sheriff: ** Hawaii, where the State of Hawaii Sheriff's Office, part of the Hawaii Department of Public Safety, serves as the statewide law enforcement agency. ** Rhode Island, the Rhode Island State Sheriff's Department is assigned to various job functions within Rhode Island's four County Court facilities (Providence County, Kent County, Newport County and Washington County). The functions of the State Sheriff's Department include Courtroom/Judicial Security, Court Facility and Cellblock Operation, Inmate Transportation, Interstate Extraditions, Interstate Inmate Transfers, Writ Service and Body Attachments. * State Marshal (Connecticut): The functions of the State Marshals Office include Courtroom/Judicial Security (bailiffs), Court Facility and Cellblock Operation, Inmate Transportation, Interstate Extraditions, Interstate Inmate Transfers, Writ Service and Body Attachments. * Motor Carrier Enforcement: another organization with many various titles and may be part of the actual State Police or Highway Patrol. Many belong their state's Department of Transportation or even the Secretary of State. These agencies conduct vehicle inspections and enforce the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) as mandated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). They conduct safety inspections of commercial motor vehicles (primarily trucks and buses), inspects highway shipments of hazardous materials, and performs compliance reviews (safety performance audits) on motor carriers. The DPS adopts and enforces driver and vehicle safety regulations and hazardous materials regulations as part of this program. Both the Arkansas Highway Police and the New Hampshire Highway Patrols are motor carrier enforcement agencies. * Marine Patrol: The state water police. *Game Wardens: Charged to enforce state hunting, and fishing laws. Most Game Wardens can also enforce all state laws (traffic, drugs, etc.). In some state, they can be the enforcement arm of an agency (California Department of Fish and Wildlife), or a division of an umbrella law enforcement agency (Alaska Wildlife Troopers). * State Park Police: California State Park Rangers, Maryland, New Jersey, New York.https://parks.ny.gov/park- police/default.aspx Florida Park Police. * Florida Department of Law Enforcement: In 1967, the Florida Legislature merged the responsibilities of several state criminal justice organizations to create the Bureau of Law Enforcement. The Bureau began with 94 positions, headed by a Commissioner who reported to the Governor, certain Cabinet members, two Sheriffs, and one Chief of Police. In July 1969, after government restructuring, the Bureau became the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). :Today, FDLE is headed by a Commissioner who is appointed by the Governor and approved by the Cabinet. Headquartered in Tallahassee, FDLE employs nearly 2,000 members statewide who work at the department's seven Regional Operations Centers, 15 field offices and seven crime laboratories. The members of FDLE are guided by four fundamental values as they respond to the needs of Florida's citizens and criminal justice community: service, integrity, respect, and quality. FDLE is structured to deliver services in five program areas:Executive Direction and Business, Support Program, Criminal Investigations and Forensic Science Program, Florida Capitol Police Program, Criminal Justice Information Program, Criminal Justice Professionalism Program. * North Carolina Capital Police: The security police agency for state buildings in NC, primarily inside the I-440 Beltline in the Raleigh area.

The two differed however as the Greyshirts emphasised Aryan race rhetoric and so organised amongst the various white immigrant communities whilst the OB were specifically for Afrikaner only.Christoph Marx, 'The Ossewabrandwag As a Mass Movement, 1939-1941', Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2 (Jun. 1994), p. 208 A third, more minor group, the New Order, emerged in 1940 under the leadership of former cabinet minister Oswald Pirow. After the Second World War Pirow became an important figure in neo-fascism, working closely with Oswald Mosley, Nation Europa and A. F. X. Baron.G. Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black - Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism after 1945, New York: IB Tauris, 2007, pp. 84-5 Nazi Germany sought to encourage such activity with former Olympic boxer Robey Leibbrandt active as an agent for the Abwehr during the war. The Nazi Party itself also organised until it was outlawed in 1936.Roger Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, 1993, p. 158 In the post-war era, far right groups that are sometimes characterised as being neo-fascist in nature include the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging,Peter H. Merkl, Leonard Weinberg, The Revival of Right Wing Extremism in the Nineties, Routledge, 2014, p. 255 the Vereniging van Oranjewerkers,Roger Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, Routledge, 2013, p. 159 the Herstigte Nasionale Party and the Boeremag; as well, there are fascist elements within the coalition Afrikaner Volksfront.Kathryn A. Manzo, Creating Boundaries: The Politics of Race and Nation, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998, p. 86 North Africa North Africa has also seen activity that has sometimes been identified as fascism. The high level of movement between France and French North Africa meant that political ideas travelled between the regions; indeed, as early as the 1890s the proto-fascist Antisemitic League of France was active in Algiers.Stanley G. Payne, Fascism in Europe, 1914-45, 2001, p. 45 It was not until later however that indigenous versions began to emerge. In 1930s Egypt the Young Egypt movement, known as the greenshirts, became important. They followed the models of fascist groups in Europe and praised Italian fascism and Nazism, although they largely supported existing elites.Payne, A History of Fascism, pp. 353 Within the Egyptian Army General 'Aziz 'Ali al-Misri (1878-1965) was noted for his fascist sympathies, to the extent that he was dismissed as Chief of Staff in 1940. Masri deserted the army and attempted to link up with the Afrika Korps but was arrested before he could escape.Yaacov Shimoni & Evyatar Levine, Political Dictionary of the Middle East in the 20th Century, 1974, p. 250 In Italian Libya, Benito Mussolini sought to gain popularity by presenting himself as a defender of Islam and he formed a Libyan Arab Fascist Party to which indigenous people were admitted.Payne, A History of Fascism, pp. 352 This was not the case in Ethiopia, where resistance was much fiercer and fascism did not take root. In both colonies, though, fascist youth movements were formed under Italian tutelage (Arab Lictor Youth and Ethiopian Lictor Youth). East Africa Like North Africa, the east of the continent saw some early development amongst white immigrant communities. A number of pro-fascist aristocrats, including Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll and Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth, made their homes in Kenya during the 1930s. Although too few in number to form any meaningful political grouping they nonetheless maintained close links to the British Union of Fascists, of which most had been members.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 499 Other white settlers organised pro-Nazi groups in Rhodesia during the Second World War.Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, p. 165 The Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) has been described as a Rwandan Hutu fascist political party responsible for inciting the Rwandan genocide. The CDR refused to operate within the law nor cooperate with other Rwandan political parties.Christian P. Scherrer. Ethnicity, nationalism, and violence: conflict management, human rights, and multilateral regimes. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003. Pp. 328 The CDR had a paramilitary wing, the Impuzamugambi that repeatedly provoked violent confrontations with members of other parties, using hand grenades and bombs, and served as one of the death squads that massacred Tutsis in the Rwandan Genocide. Parallels have frequently been drawn between Hitler and Uganda's Idi AminIdi Amin Dada: Hitler in Africa and it has been claimed that Amin's admiration for Hitler was so great that he even intended to build a statue of him. American political scientist and historian Robert Paxton, a scholar on fascism, has stated, that from an ideological standpoint he shared little or nothing with proper fascism, sharing only cruelty and anti-Semitism with Hitler. However, Swiss historian Max-Liniger-Goumaz, a scholar on African history, has identified Idi Amin amongst a list of other African leaders as being an example of the phenomenon of \\"Afro-fascism\\". American historian and political scientist Robert Paxton, a scholar on the topic of fascism, has rejected the idea that there have been indigenous fascist movements in Africa, claiming that there have been no prominent examples of fascist regimes amongst Third World dictatorships.Robert O. Paxton, The Anatomy of Fascism, 2004, p. 191 Paxton also rejects the view that Idi Amin's rule in Uganda was fascist in nature. However, other scholars assert that there have been indigenous fascist regimes in Africa. Swiss historian Max-Liniger-Goumaz, a scholar on African history, has identified multiple African regimes as being examples of the phenomenon of \\"Afro-fascism\\", including: Francisco Macías Nguema's regime in Equatorial Guinea, Mobutu Sese Seko's regime in Zaire, Idi Amin's in Uganda, Gnassingbé Eyadéma in Togo, and Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime in Ethiopia.Michel Ugarte. Africans in Europe: the culture of exile and emigration from Equatorial Guinea to Spain. University of Illinois Press, 2010. Pp. 25.

Pp. 223. Such post-war regimes are excluded from political science typologies of fascism however. Such notions of indigenous African fascism have generally been excluded, often explicitly, from political science typologies of fascism. As well as Paxton Roger Griffin rejects the notion of fascism in Africa (outside of South Africa) in his book The Nature of Fascism, arguing that African dictatorships do not seek the mass mobilisation of their populations necessary for a regime to be called fascist, whilst with national borders often arbitrarily set by colonial powers and tribal, religious and ethnic loyalties frequently much stronger than national identity unifying nationalist palingenetic myths could not be constructed by groups, another precondition for true fascism.Roger Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, Routledge, 1991, p. 157 For Griffin a precondition for the rise of fascism is a breakdown in traditional society combined with an increasing liberalisation against the backdrop of socio-political instability, which also rules out post-colonial Africa where such liberalisation did not take place until much more recently, with post-colonial regimes frequently transferring directly to dictatorships, wither actual or effective.Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, p. 156 Paul Hayes accepts that individual African countries may demonstrate some characteristics of fascism, notably aspects of the regimes of Hastings Banda in Malawi or Abeid Karume in Zanzibar, but argues that in no state are enough present simultaneously that anywhere in Africa could truly be labelled fascist from an academic basis.Paul M. Hayes, Fascism, London: Allen & Unwin, 1973, pp. 208-223 Similarly Stanley G. Payne contends that whilst a one-party nationalist dictatorship may have been taken as the model in some African states none of these can genuinely be defined as fascist because the single parties usually have a small membership and often do not exist at any more than a basic functional level, the political economies do not follow the corporatist or national syndicalist models that define fascism and there is no philosophical or political culture of fascism, with such African regimes being highly pragmatic and even non-ideological in nature.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-45, Routledge, 1995, pp. 514-515 Indeed, the notion of true fascism, as opposed to mere dictatorship, in Africa was further eroded in the 1970s when many regimes did add an ideological dimension in the shape of Marxism-Leninism.Payne, A History of Fascism, p. 515 West Africa During World War II, the French colonies in West Africa sided with Vichy France, a German puppet state. Gnassingbé Eyadéma dictator of Togo and leader of the Rally of the Togolese People is sometimes used as an example of a contemporary fascist in Africa. The Liberian National Patriotic Party contains two key components of fascist ideology, authoritarianism and nationalism.

Office management provides an overall framework within which individual projects are commissioned, designed and completed. Both parts have the same objectives but are typically addressed by separate management systems. Office management involves the allocation and financing of resources, principally premises, trained staff and computer systems, and on establishing and charging appropriate fees for the services rendered. Project management focuses on timescales, developing a design from initial concept to working drawings, and managing the construction process (see for example Emmitt, 2014). The essence of architectural management is to ensure that work on a project is cost- effective, to achieve a balance between profitability and design quality.  Development  Standard management techniques and tools, borrowed mainly from repetitive industrial processes, have not always fitted comfortably with the image of the architect as a creative individual, rather than a professional member of a business team. The term ‘architectural management’ has been in use since the 1960s as building construction became more complex, because of a shift from standard traditional construction details, to innovation and experimentation. Architectural practices generally employ an office manager who may have at their disposal an administration assistant or team of assistants. Project management is increasingly a role played by an independent consultant, especially during the construction phase. Project managers are typically from one of the surveying disciplines, leaving only the architectural elements to be managed in-house by the architects.

His father had been Vice- Chamberlain of the Household to Queen Mary and George IThomas Coke served from 1706 to 1727 and briefly (in 1704) Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer. Melbourne Hall, Derbyshire His father died when he was twelve and he was taken care of by his uncle, John Coke, in London. He attended Oxford University in 1732 and property at Kings Newton was purchased for him by his uncle.Coke of Trusley He also inherited his father's property at Melbourne, Derbyshire. When Coke was nineteen he embarked on the traditional Grand Tour of Europe, despite being appointed Surveyor-General of His Majesty's Customs two years before when he was just 17.The History of Melbourne Hall In the first year he visited Paris and ?? after staying over the winter in Montpelier, he visited Rome, Venice. Whilst in Italy he had his portrait painted by the Italian painter, Pompeo Batoni - who made a good living from young English aristocrats. Like other Grand Tour portraits, Coke appears amongst antiquities. In this case the Coliseum is in the background of Batoni's composition. When Coke returned from abroad he was accompanied by a \\"companion and tutor\\" known as John Lewis Pasteur. Between 1742 and 1745, Coke hired William Smith to remodel the gardens of Melbourne Hall which, together with rebuilding the front and east wing, completed the plans of his father who had died prematurely. In 1745 a key event happened in British History when Bonnie Prince Charlie travelled with Scottish supporters south towards London to claim the throne of England. The troops made it as far as Swarkestone Bridge which takes the road between Derby and Melbourne over the River Trent. A source says, the Deputy Lieutenant and the monarch's representative in the county in 1745 was George Lewis Coke.\\"The Owners of Melbourne Hall, Howard Usher, 1993 On his death in 1751, his property went to his sister, Charlotte, who had married the family lawyer, Sir Matthew Lamb, 1st Baronet, and was to become grandmother to William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the Victorian Prime Minister. Coke's companion, Pasteur, lived until the year 1793 after marrying and having three children in England and paying the Hearth Tax on the hall in 1777, over twenty years after Coke's death. Afterwards and alternatively In 1860, the fabric of Melbourne church was restored and this involved the removal of \\"hundreds of skulls\\"; the first coffin to be removed was that of George Lewis Coke which was unusual in shape. This was recorded by the local historian John Joseph Briggs who also noted the story about his valet, John Lewis Pasteur. According to Briggs, Coke had returned from abroad in the coffin, 109 years before, with Pasteur as valet. It was Pasteur who went on to be a shepherd in Bredon.. [\\"The History of Melbourne in the county of Derby, including Biographical Notices of the Coke, Melbourne and Hardinge Families\\", by John Joseph Briggs, Bemrose, 1852.] Briggs indicates that Coke never returned alive from his foreign tour and that his coffin was of \\"foreign\\" construction.

It is uninhabited or occasionally sparsely inhabited, and used only as a hunting and fishing territory. History On August 30, 1851, the act was authorized to set apart lands in Lower Canada for the use and benefit of the Seven Nations, First Nation tribes. Two years later on August 9, 1853, the Governor General in Council approved the distribution list as proposed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, John Rolph. According to that list, the \\"Indians of Caughnawaga (Kahnawake) and lake Deux Montagnes\\" (Kanesatake) were allotted the south-east quarter of the township of Doncaster, behind the township of Wexford. The area indicated was .Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Doncaster On May 26, 1890 a petition by squatters was signed in presence of Priest Lajeunesse then in charge, by some of them, 43 inhabitants of the Doncaster Township requesting the abolition of the Mohawk reserve in the township:Pouliot-Thisdale, Eric, Archives and history of Tiowero:ton, Chapter 1: Creations of Reserves in Lower Canada 1853, Library and Archives Canada, 2018, 552 pages, pp. 11, , retrieved 25 April 2019 \\"Honorable Sir, Us subsigned, living in the Doncaster District, are asking very humbly for you to use your upmost influence to make the savage reserve disappear from our district and to make a land survey. This reserve which contains a large number of excellent lands proper to agriculture, located in the middle of occupied lands by a French Canadian population annexed to our village, is observed as an anomaly and all of them are hoping to see it disappear. Anyways, it can’t be of any utility to the savages who will never come to install themselves, since the games are lacking. Also, the wood is being stolen from all sides, they are taking the wood, so the sooner it will be measures, fewer damages will be done. We are observing that the reserve in the township of Doncaster is a big obstacle to colonisation progress in our locality. Our municipality is suffering from it since this reserve contains about the third of the district. For these reasons, Honorable Sir, we hope that you will favorably accept our request, and we won’t stop praying that Ste Lucie of Doncaster.\\" The period ranging from 1897 to 1905 is exposing the several attempts from Squatters of Ste. Lucie to obtain grants from the government in order to legitimize their own developments in the Doncaster reserve, despite the clearly established rules mentioned in the correspondences concerning its creation and purposes. The conflictuous situations in which the Squatters and the Mayor of Ste Lucie of Doncaster did all they possibly could to obtain clemency to keep promoting their developments in Doncaster, before the effect of the Chrome Mining Company precedent of 1920, is exposed in a memorandum- note from 22 January 1896, from the Ottawa’s Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to E. L. Newcomb, Esq, Deputy Minister of Justice, Ottawa. “Sir, I beg to enclose this file numbered 34 070 of this Department containing correspondences respecting Squatters in the Doncaster Indian Reserve and would refer to Memorandum of 3rd December 1893 which gives a summary of the correspondence and also to letter addressed to Agent Brosseau on the 9th Ultimo and his reply of the 10th instant in which he states that the Indians are quite determined neither to lease nor sell the Reserve for any consideration and if the Squatters have made improvements thereon, the Department should charge them a rent for the land in as much as the Tribe requires the land for some of its members. Will you be good enough to advise me, under the circumstances whether the Department could succeed in a suit of ejectment against these trespassers or whether it could charge a rental for past use and occupation of the land and also for future use and occupation without a Surrender having been obtained from the Indians.

Then, the management proposed by the Indian Affairs responsible in 1905 suggested a \\"per quota\\" management by both nations, Kahnawake and Kanehsatake, considering that the population of Kahnawake was representing the 2/3 of the population and Kanesatake the 1/3. Even though this \\"per quota\\" conceptualisation of land share as never been considered as a Mohawk concept, it was suggested by the Indian agent then responsible as observed in a newspaper article from La Presse, 16 September 1905, which exposed:La Presse, 16 September 1905, \\"Caughnawaga\\", page 25, Pouliot-Thisdale, Eric, Library and National archives of Quebec, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales of Québec, http://collections.banq.qc.ca/retrieve/10642184, retrieved 25 April 2019 \\"At the last council meeting of the tribe, also attended by representatives from each of the Oka tribes and Gibson, Muskoka, Ont., To find a way to share the Doncaster Reserve, containing an area of 18,000 acres, located in the county of Terrebonne. This reservation was granted 50 years ago, to the Iroquois of Oka and Caughnawaga, and since the revenues were split between the two tribes per capita. Our people ask sharing the reserve the same way; the Okas, who are only a quarter, ask for equal sharing and not per capita. The Caughnawagas number 2,100 souls. This issue has been under consideration since twelve months.\\" The notion of Kahnawake having sole ownership came from this administrative arrangement which was agreed to at some point: that, based on population and budgetary considerations, Kahnawake would have 2/3 of the financial responsibility and Kanesatake 1/3. Though, from all previous ministerial correspondences, it was always exposed that Doncaster’s Indian reserve was managed by both communities. Though, this practice of land management through a \\"per quota\\" (per capita) distribution is not coming from any aboriginal customs, so therefore it was managed by governmental administrator ignoring the Mohawk's ancestral customary land sharing practices. It remained an administrative puzzle until 2018-19 and it is still unsettled through the current administrative management of the ministerial department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.Pouliot-Thisdale, Eric, Archives and history of Tiowero:ton, Library and Archives Canada, 2018, 552 pages, pp. 4, , retrieved 25 April 2019 Demographics Population:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006 census * Population in 2006: n/a * Population in 2001: n/a * Population in 1996: 0 * Population in 1991: 4 References Category:Geography of Laurentides Category:Mohawk reserves in Quebec ","title":"Doncaster, Quebec"},{"id":"24354302","text":"Sportivo Tarapacá Ferrocarril was a Peruvian football club, located in the city of Lima.

DTP provides software testing analytics via an internal intelligence engine. Analytics are a way to provide actionable information and insights, beyond the list and graphs found in normal software development reports and dashboards. DTP comes with built-in algorithms that perform various analytics that are commonly needed by software development managers, such as aggregated code coverage, which is a way of collecting coverage data from multiple test runs as well as different types of testing activities like manual testing and unit testing, and change-based testing, which is a form of impact analysis that helps understand which tests need to be run in order to validate changes, as well as which tests can safely be skipped. DTP's web-based UI provides interactive reports and dashboards including a flexible, user-configurable reporting system with full open published APIs to put data in from any software development or testing tool. The Process Intelligence Engine (PIE) in DTP provides analytic capabilities and is open for developers and managers to customize to their individual needs as well as extend with new algorithms and analytics.

It bore four equally spaced narrow white stripes with a large orange-gold disc over the middle two lines in the center of the flag, undulating horizontally across a blue field representing the Caribbean Sea and the sun shining upon the waves. The flag was originally designed by Edna Manley. The flag is shown as 1:2; the upper two white stripes reflect the lower ones. The official description given in the West Indies Gazette is \\"Flag approved has blue ground with four white horizontal wavy bars (the top pair of bars being parallel and the lower pair also parallel) and an orange sun in the centre.\\" \\"Blue\\", unless qualified, usually means the same blue as in a Blue Ensign. However, whatever the establishing resolution called for, many copies were made that were at variance with it, as variants often show a pale blue or Imperial blue field. The naval ensign (used by coast guard vessels) was a British white ensign with the federal flag in the canton. Flag flying days were Commemorative Days-the usual British flag flying days, and Federal Days-January 3, Inception of the Federation; February 23, Federation Day; and April 22, Inauguration of the Federal Parliament. Buildings with two flagstaffs were to fly the Union Jack and the Federation Flag on Commemorative Days and on Federal Days; the Union Jack at the staff on the left when facing the building. Buildings with only one staff were to fly the Union Jack on Commemorative Days and the Federation Flag on Federal Days. Video clips of the flag at the 1960 Summer Olympics appear to show a red or bronze disc, lighter blue and the flag is symmetrical about both axes. The flag of the West Indies Federation was flown at the cricket test match between Australia and the West Indies held in Barbados in 1999. Despite the dissolution of the Federation in the 1960s and some countries and territories not being part of the Federation, the Caribbean nations compete together as one West Indies cricket team, but under a different flag.

Chan-Chan is known to have been inhabited by hunter- gatherers during two periods of the Middle Archaic, separated by a hiatus. One period spans from 6420 to 6250 BP and the other from 6130 to 5730 BP. The beach of Chan-Chan extends on the north to Huezhui tombolo and on the south to a peninsula. The archaeological site itself is located above the beach, on a coastal terrace, that was formed by sediments of allochthonous (exotic) and autochthonous (local) origin. The allochthonous material consist of volcanic rocks as well as retransportated mollusc shells. The autochthonous material is chiefly made of sands, gravel and peat. Pino, Mario and Navarro, Rayen. Geoarqueología del sitio arcaico Chan-Chan 18. Revista Geológica de Chile, 2005. After examining several artifacts found on the coast of the Valdivia and Concepción areas, archaeologist Menghin claimed the findings belong to a \\"Chanchaense Complex\\" or culture extending from Quiriquina Island (37° S) in the north to Tierra del Fuego (55° S) in the south. The inhabitants of Chan- Chan had access to a substantial diversity of rocks, with schists, basalt, quartz and chert being found close to or at the archaeological site. The inhabitants of Chan-Chan had even grey obsidian from Chaitén Volcano, located 400 km south of Chan-Chan. As of 2005, 3484 stone handcrafts and 12,050 carve outs have been found in Chan-Chan as well as bones from mammals, birds and fishes apart from middens of marine invertebrate shells. The superficial layers of the Chan-Chan site were washed by the tsunami that followed the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, which produced waves of 12 to 15 meters. These waves possibly emplaced some disc-shaped cobbles in the terrace of Chan-Chan. The same kind of disc-shaped cobbles are found in the lower layers of human occupation in Chan-Chan, as well, leaving open the possibility that they were deposited by an ancient tsunami, according to Pino and Navarro.

The University of Louisville Libraries is a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and, along with Ekstrom, includes libraries for Art, Health Sciences, Law, and Music, as well as the Archives and Special Collections. The University of Louisville Libraries hold approximately 2.2 million print volumes, subscribe to several thousand serials, and provide full-text electronic access to approximately 74,000 journals. Ekstrom is a Federal Depository Library and houses the largest selective government document collection in Kentucky. History The University Library grew from an original donation of Dean John Letcher Patterson's personal collection in the early 1900s. By 1950, the library had over 36,000 books in its collection. In 1956, the university gave the library its own building (now Schneider Hall) to accommodate the growing collection. By 1970, the collection contained over 200,000 items. At the end of the 1970s, the University Library building reached capacity, forcing parts of the collection to be placed in storage. Plans were made to create a new $14 million library to accommodate the growing collection. Named after Dr. William F. Ekstrom, a noted English professor and the first Academic Vice-President of the university, the Ekstrom Library opened on August 28, 1981. At the same time as the opening of Ekstrom Library, all the university's branch libraries, except for Law, were placed under the leadership of the University Librarian, rather than the deans of the corresponding schools. The new building was designed by the Architect firm Louis & Henry of Louisville, Kentucky. The brick and exposed concrete design of the building incorporated the character of the open spaces on campus and the surrounding structures. The large glass windows featured a glazing system that allowed restricted solar heating. The new library earned the Kentucky Society of Architects Merit Award for outstanding design. The University Libraries were invited to join the Association of College and Research Libraries (ARL) as its 124th member in 2002. The offer was based on ARL's assessment of scope of the Libraries' collections, uniqueness of resources, contributions to scholarship, and research contributions to the field of information science. In 2006, a new wing was added to the library at a cost of $14.9 million. The new 51,000 sq.ft., three-story addition featured the relocated McConnell Center for Political Leadership, a new 24-hour study area, a café, new instruction labs, an auditorium, and the new Robotic Retrieval System (RRS). This temperature and humidity-controlled storage system, one of the first in the nation, has a 600,000 volume capacity and retrieves patron requests in approximately 2 minutes. Collections and departments Ekstrom Library houses or provides access to several unique collections, including but not limited to: *The Granville Bunton African American Collection—over 4,000 volumes focusing on African American and Pan African history, literature, and culture *The Bingham Poetry Collection—over 6,000 volumes of poetry, with an emphasis on North American and British poetry *The Louise Galloway Browsing Collection—a revolving collection of popular interest titles and bestsellers *The Student Government Association Video Collection—a collection of feature films funded by the University of Louisville Student Government Association Archives and Special Collections, considered a separate library, is headquartered within Ekstrom Library. It includes 1) Photographic Archives housing nearly 2 million photographs, 2) Rare Books and manuscripts focusing on local, regional, national, and international topics, 3) the University Archives and Records Center, and 4) the Digital Initiatives office which is responsible for digital collections of images, documents, and oral histories. Reference librarians at Ekstrom Library answer questions in person at the reference desk on the first floor or by phone, instant message chat, or e-mail. Individual research advisory appointments with a reference librarian are also offered. Ekstrom Library's Special Services Office helps those with disabilities use the library. In addition to providing adaptive technology equipment, library staff aid in retrieving books, making photocopies, and locating library materials. Other departments at Ekstrom Library include Circulation, Collection Development, Copyright Permissions Services, Current Periodicals and Microforms, Distance Learning Library Services, Information Literacy, Interlibrary Loan, Media Resources, Office of Libraries' Technology, Office of the University Libraries' Dean, Stacks Maintenance, and Technical Services. Endowed Chair for Scholarly Communication Established in 1997 and funded by the estate of a former University of Louisville librarian and Kentucky's Research Challenge Trust Fund, the Evelyn J. Schneider Endowed Chair for Scholarly Communication was the state's first endowed library chair. The chair holder, whose office is located in Ekstrom Library, focuses on concerns and policies related to scholarly communication and copyright law at the university, state, and national levels. University units located in Ekstrom Library In addition to Ekstrom Library's services and collections, the library is home to several university organizations, including: *Delphi Center for Enhancing Teaching & Learning - The center aids teaching through technological instruction assistance, distance education services, and development of education-related software. *University Writing Center - The center helps students and faculty improve their writing through individualized and group assistance. *Muhammad Ali Institute for Peace and Justice - The institute's mission is to \\"advance the work, study and practice of peacemaking, social justice and violence prevention through the development of innovative educational programs, training, service and research.\\" *Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research - The institute honors civil rights activist Anne Braden through academic research related to social justice, particularly in Louisville and the South. *McConnell Center for Political Leadership - The center provides guidance to undergraduates interested in politics and government to become future leaders in the community.

History It was built in 1949 by Philip & Son of Dartmouth, Devon, UK as the MV Berry Castle for the River Dart Steamboat Co Ltd (RDSC). She was named after Berry Pomeroy Castle, which is located a few miles from the River Dart and was the third vessel in the fleet to bear the name. MV Berry Castle was used on the company's River Dart services from Dartmouth and Totnes in South Devon. In 1972 she was sold to Discover Galapagos Ltd, to be fitted out for diving in Honduras. This project failed and she was operated on the Medway by Discover Galapagos as the MV Golden Cormorant. In 1976 she returned to the Dart, owned by the RDSC's successor: Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd, and was renamed MV Totnes Castle.Clammer, R & Kittridge,A. Passenger Steamers of the River Dart & Kingsbridge Estuary, The Paddle Steamer Preservation Society &Twelveheads; Press, 1987 In 1985 Dart Pleasure Craft, which had previously bought the Millbrook Steamboat & Trading Co Ltd of Plymouth, withdrew its services from the Plymouth area, and in the process, MV Totnes Castle was sold to Plymouth Boat Cruises. She operated cruises from Plymouth. During her time in Plymouth she gained additional enclosed accommodation in the form of a large deckhouse on the former open deck behind her wheelhouse. In 2006 she was sold to Ullswater Navigation and Transit Company, and moved to Ullswater, involving an overland journey to this land-locked lake. She was renamed MV Lady Wakefield. On 6 December 2015 Lady Wakefield suffered damage while moored at Pooley Bridge pier during Storm Desmond. She started to take on water, and was rescued by being run aground the following day. On 12 May 2016, MV Lady Wakefield was rolled back into the water after being beached for 5 months and docked for repair.

The area of 56 997 hectares of the Balaton-felvidéki National Park mainly consists of these six landscape protection areas.Official site of Balaton Uplands National Park The national park headquartered in Veszprém, in the largest city of the Balaton area.  Tihany Peninsula  In 1952 the first protected landscape area of Hungary was created in the most attractive, most varied and scientifically best researched area of the country. It covers 1, 562 hectares, of which 195 is highly protected. The staff of the Hungarian Balaton Limnological Research Institute - founded in 1927 in Tihany - not only studied the biology of the lake, but also did extensive research on the peninsula of Tihany. As a result, hundreds of publications have dealt with its geology, fauna and flora. All the research supported the idea of granting protection to this area.  Pécselyi Basin  The gently sloping hillsides, wide mountaintops and basins, flat highlands with spotted karstic elements (e.g. karren fields) characterize the area. A relict of the basalt volcanic activities in the Quaternary is the Halom Hill at Mencshely.  Káli Basin  The most characteristic part of the Balaton Uplands was granted protection - perhaps at the last moment - when a protected landscape area in the Káli Basin was established in 1984 on an area of 9,111 hectares.  Tapolca Basin  For hundreds of years poets, novelists and painters have been calling the Badacsony and its vicinity the most beautiful landscape in Hungary. One of the greatest achievements of the Hungarian nature conservation movement is that the basalt quarries opened here in 1903 have finally been closed down. The famous playwrighter Ferenc Herczeg made powerful efforts in the Upper House in the 1920s to have them closed. A press campaign was also launched, but the last quarries where only finally closed in 1964. Those on the Gulács and Tóti Hills were abandoned at the end of World War II and in the early 1950s. The Szentgyörgy and Csobánc Hills are more fortunate: their basalt was not found suitable for building purposes, so there are only small wounds on their flanks.  Keszthely Mountains  The characteristic bedrock of the forested area is dolomite. On this bedrock typical for the Transdanubian Mountains, the flora and fauna are determined by the special ecological conditions.  Kis-Balaton  The Kis Balaton, as a huge wetland habitat is unique in the whole of Europe, which is why it has always been recorded by international nature conservation. Its wonderful world of birds was already famous in the last century; and has survived despite the draining of the marsh started in 1922. It is therefore not surprising that when Hungary joined the Ramsar Convention in 1979, the Kis Balaton was included in the list of \\"Wetlands of International Importance as Waterfowl Habitat\\".

He received a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Kaduna State in Northern Nigeria. Career Katsina State in Nigeria Mahmud Kanti Bello was elected senator during the 2003 Nigeria general elections under the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in Katsina State. Bello protested strongly against electoral fraud in a 2004 local elections held in his state, which resulted in People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidates being returned. However, in 2007 he successfully ran for reelection on a PDP slate. By the middle of his second term in the senate, Bello was among those senators who had not solely sponsored any private bills. In a statement in January 2009, Bello lashed out against governors who withhold local government funds, releasing them only at their convenience, including the governor of his state, Ibrahim Shema. In discussion over the proposed bill to control desertification, Senator Bello strongly opposed Senator Grace Folashade Bent, chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Ecology, who wanted to include other environmental issues in the bill. In July 2009, South-South senators initiated a motion to demand dismissal of Minister of Petroleum, Rilwan Lukman, and Mohammed Barkindo of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, on the basis of alleged anti-Niger Delta policies. Senator Bello opposed the motion on a point of order, without success. In 2009, Bello was the Nigerian Amir-Hajj for the Nigerian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. He broke a record where for the first time in over 20 years all the pilgrims left on time.

This provided a continuous process, cutting out the need to pass the plates over the rolls and to double them, as in a pack mill. At the end the strip was cut with a guillotine shear or rolled into a coil. Early (hot rolling) strip mills did not produce strip suitable for tinplate, but in 1929 cold rolling began to be used to reduce the gauge further. The first strip mill in the United Kingdom was opened at Ebbw Vale in 1938 with an annual output of 200,000 tons. The strip mill had several advantages over pack mills: * It was cheaper due to having all parts of the process, starting with blast furnaces on the same site. * Softer steel could be used. * Larger sheets could be produced at lower cost and this reduced cost and enabled tinplate and steel sheet to be used for more purposes. * It was capital intensive, rather than labour-intensive.

According to the organization’s charter, SOCMA's stated mission is to \\"accelerat[e] the potential for members' growth,\\" \\"increase[e] public confidence in the batch, custom and specialty chemical industry,\\" and \\"influenc[e] the passage of rational laws and regulations.\\"  History  The \\"Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association\\", as it was previously known, was established on September 15, 1921 at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The event was followed by an organizational meeting in Washington, DC, which included an address from Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. In his remarks, Hoover told the chemical industry representatives that “I have a feeling that this coming together of manufacturers in the different trades for the purpose of the advancement of their industry as a whole is a profound step towards cooperation in the entire business world, and that out of it will be gained tremendous benefits to the whole business public.\\" SOCMA members unanimously elected Charles Herty, an American chemist, to serve as the Association’s first president. At the time, Herty was the editor of American Chemical Society’s Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, a position he left in order to lead SOCMA. The organization was based in New York City until it relocated to Washington, DC in the 1970s. On March 19, 2009, SOCMA members voted to formally change the organization’s name to the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates. The name change, the first in SOCMA’s 88-year history, allowed the organization to retain its acronym.  Members  SOCMA member companies encompass small, medium and large chemical manufacturers engaged in batch production. Batch manufacturers produce intermediates, specialty chemicals and ingredients used to develop a wide range of commercial and consumer products. They operate differently from larger, bulk chemical producers, which generally use continuous production.  Activities   Lobbying  SOCMA promotes the batch chemical manufacturing industry to the U.S. federal government and international governing bodies. SOCMA lobbies on a number of issues impacting the chemical industry, including the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, and the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. In addition to formal lobbying, SOCMA promotes industry interests through a grassroots arm called SOCMA CONNECT.  ChemStewards  In September 2005, SOCMA introduced ChemStewards, the first environmental, health, safety and security (EHS&S;) program designed for batch chemical manufacturers. The ChemStewards EHS&S; program requires participants to address performance improvement with consideration for their company’s policies and practices. The program offers a three-tiered approach to participation: fundamentals, enhanced performance and excellence. All tiers require adherence to a set of core principles in addition to security, metrics and a verifiable management system. In April 2011, SOCMA announced a new management system database that integrates its ChemStewards® program with other government-sponsored performance improvement programs. The database, created by Gabriel Performance Products, is based on the ChemStewards Management System and complies with the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OSHAS 18001.  SOCMA Association Management Services  In 1977, SOCMA launched an Association Management Services Group to manage consortia formed to address specific chemical or process advocacy, regulatory, testing, stewardship, or technical issues that are of interest to a particular sector of the chemical industry. As of 2012, SOCMA has 16 active affiliate groups, including the Biphenyl Work Group, the Bulk Pharmaceutical Task Force, and the Nanotechnology SME Manufacturers Coalition.  Informex  In 1984, SOCMA founded Informex, a trade show for the fine and specialty chemicals industry. In August 2005, SOCMA sold Informex to CMP Information Ltd, part of and currently known as United Business Media, PLC, headquartered in London, England.  ChemAlliance  In May 2009, SOCMA acquired ChemAlliance, an online compliance assistance center formerly funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and designed to improve regulatory compliance of the chemical manufacturing industry. ChemAlliance.org was launched in 1996 as part of former Vice President Al Gore’s “Reinventing Government” initiative. Through this acquisition, SOCMA has obtained the naming rights and full ownership of ChemAlliance.

They are the traditional shoemakers of South Asia. History and origin Historically, the community was involved in the manufacture of protective leather crafts. Present circumstances In Gujarat, the Mochi caste is categorised as OBC in Bakshi panch. They are belonging to Rajput’s Clan and mostly they are from Saurashtra (Kathiyawad) They also call Kathi darbar. The Mochi are involved in the manufacture of leather shoes. The community have a traditional caste council, as is common among many North Indian artisan communities. This caste council acts as an instrument of social control, by punishing those who contravene community norms. Each caste council is headed by a chaudhary, a position that tends to be hereditary. The Mochi live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. The Mochi of Haryana claim to have migrated from Rajasthan, and are found mainly in the cantonment city of Ambala. They still speak the Braj Bhasha dialect. They are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. Their traditional occupation was shoe making, but with the spread of factory manufactured shoes it has declined. A large number are landless agricultural labourers, with minority now taking up other professions. They enjoy scheduled caste status and benefits of affirmative actions taken for underprivileged groups. Mochi of Punjab In Punjab, the members of the Mochi caste are those involved with the working in tanned leather as opposed to a tanner, an occupation associated with the Chamar. Most Mochi are still found in rural Punjab, although there is a steady immigration to the towns and cities, as their traditional occupation is in decline. They are one of the most widespread castes in Punjab, found in almost every district. Most Mochi in pre partition Punjab had forcibly been converted to Islam, and these Muslim Mochis left at the time of the partition of India in 1947. The remaining community is largely Hindu and Sikh. Many Mochi have now become members of the Arya Samaj sect. The community has now been granted Scheduled Caste status, which allows it to access a number of affirmative actions programmes initiated by the Government of India. The Mochi in rural Punjab in Pakistan is still dependent on the local landlord, who acts as patron. Often, the Mochi does not own his property, but rents from the landlord. The Mochi is thus entirely dependent on the locally dominant caste, and are paid from each cash crop at the end of the harvesting season according to a system called seypi.Justice in Practice Legal Ethnography of a Punjab Village by Muhammad Azam Chuadhary, Oxford University Press, 1999 Presently, many Mochis are no longer involved in their traditional occupation of shoemaking. Many are now landless agricultural labourers. Overall, the condition of the Mochi community in Punjab has worsened. There has been a marked shift towards manufactured shoes, which has seen a severe decline in their traditional occupation. Many of their patrons from the locally dominant castes such as the Muslim Jats no longer pay the traditional seypi. Unlike in India, the Government of Pakistan has not provided any affirmative actions programmes. As such, the Mochi are one of the most vulnerable ethnic communities in Pakistan, and are often victims of societal discrimination.

Individual terms distinguish between those hadith considered rightfully attributed to their source or detail the faults of those of dubious provenance. Formally, it has been defined by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani as: \\"knowledge of the principles by which the condition of the narrator and the narrated are determined.\\" This page comprises the primary terminology used within hadith studies. Classification of Hadith  Terminology pertaining to a narration's origin  Different terms are used for the origin of a narration. These terms specify whether a narration is attributed to Muhammad, a companion, a successor or a latter historical figure. Marfuʻ Ibn al- Salah said: \\"Marfoʻ () refers to a narration attributed specifically to the Prophet [Muhammad]. This term does not refer to other than him unless otherwise specified. The category of marfuʻ is inclusive of narrations attributed to the Prophet regardless of their being muttasil, munqatiʻ or mursal among other categories.\\"Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah, by Ibn al-Salah, along with Muhasin al-Istilah by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, pg. 193-5, Dar al-Ma'arif, Cairo. Mawquf According to Ibn al-Salah, \\"Mawquf () refers to a narration attributed to a companion, whether a statement of that companion, an action or otherwise.\\" Maqtu' Ibn al- Salah defined maqtu\` () as a narration attributed to a Tabi‘i (a successor of one of Muhammad's companions), whether it is a statement of that successor, an action or otherwise. In spite of the linguistic similarity, it is distinct from munqatiʻ.  Terminology relating to the number of narrators in an isnad  In hadith terminology, a hadith is divided into two categories based, essentially, upon the number of narrators mentioned at each level in a particular isnād. Consideration is given to the fewest narrators at any level of the chain of narration; thus if ten narrators convey a hadith from two others who have conveyed it from ten, it is considered ʻaziz, not mashhur.Nuzhah al-Nathar, by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, printed with: Al-Nukat Ala Nuzhah al-Nathr, pgs. 51–70, by Ali ibn Hasan ibn Ali, Dar Ibn al-Jawzi, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 1422. Mutawatir The first category is mutawatir ( meaning \\"successive\\") narration. A successive narration is one conveyed by narrators so numerous that it is not conceivable that they have agreed upon an untruth thus being accepted as unquestionable in its veracity. The number of narrators is unspecified. A hadith is said to be mutawatir if it was reported by a significant, though unspecified, number of narrators at each level in the chain of narration, thus reaching the succeeding generation through multiple chains of narration leading back to its source. This provides confirmation that the hadith is authentically attributed to its source at a level above reasonable doubt. This is due to its being beyond historical possibility that narrators could have conspired to forge a narration. In contrast, an ahaad hadith is a narration the chain of which has not reached a number sufficient to qualify as mutawatir. Types of mutawatir Hadiths can be mutawatir in both actual text and meaning: ; Mutawatir in wording''' : A hadith whose words are narrated by such a large number as is required for a mutawatir, in a manner that all the narrators are unanimous in reporting it with the same words without any substantial discrepancy. : For example: \\"[Muhammad said:] Whoever intentionally attributes a lie against me, should prepare his seat in the Fire.\\" This is a mutawatir hadith in its wordings because it has a minimum of seventy-four narrators. In other words, seventy- four companions of Muhammad have reported this hadith at different occasions, all with the same words. The number of those who received this hadith from the Companions is many times greater, because each of the seventy four Companions has conveyed it to a number of his students. Thus the total number of narrators of this hadith has been increasing in each successive generation and has never been less than seventy-four. All these narrators who now are hundreds in number, report it in the same words without even a minor change. This hadith is therefore mutawatir in its wording, because it cannot be imagined reasonably that such a large number of people have colluded to coin a fallacious sentence in order to attribute it to Muhammad. ; Mutwatir in meaning'' : A hadith which is not reported by multiple narrators using the same words. The words of the narrators are different. Sometimes even the reported events are not the same. But all the narrators are unanimous in reporting a basic concept, which is common in all reports. This common concept is also ranked as a mutawatir concept. : For example: It is reported by such a large number of narrators that Muhammad enjoined Muslims to perform two ra'kat in Fajr, four ra'kat in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha and three ra'kat in the Maghrib prayer, yet the narrations of all the reporters who reported the number of ra'kat are not in the same words. Their words are different and even the events reported by them are different. But the common feature of all the reports is the same: the exact number of ra'kat. The hadith is thus said to be mutawatir in meaning. Ahaad The second category, ahaad ( meaning \\"singular\\") narration, refers to any hadith not classified as mutawatir. Linguistically, hadith ahad refers to a hadith narrated by only one narrator. In hadith terminology, it refers to a hadith not fulfilling all of the conditions necessary to be deemed mutawatir. Hadith ahad consists of three sub-classifications also relating to the number of narrators in the chain or chains of narration: Mashhur The first category is mashhur (). This refers to hadith conveyed by three or more narrators but not considered mutawatir. ʻAziz An ʻaziz () hadith is any hadith conveyed by two narrators at every point in its isnād (chain of narrators). Gharib A gharib () hadith is one conveyed by only one narrator. Al-Tirmidhi's understanding of a gharib hadith, concurs to a certain extent with that of the other traditionists. According to him a hadith may be classified as gharib for one of the following three reasons: # Firstly, a hadith may be classified as gharib since it is narrated from one chain only. Al-Tirmidhi mentions as an example a tradition from Hammad ibn Salamah from Abu 'Usharai on the authority of his father who enquired from the Prophet whether the slaughtering of an animal is confined to the gullet and throat. The Prophet replied that stabbing the thigh will also suffice. # Secondly, a tradition can be classified as gharib due to an addition in the text, though it will be considered a sound tradition, if that addition is reported by a reliable reporter. The example cited by al-Tirmidhi is a tradition narrated through the chain of Malik (died 179 AH) from Nafi' (died 117 AH) on the authority of Ibn 'Umar (died 73 AH) who stated that the Prophet declared alms-giving at the end of Ramadan obligatory upon every Muslim, male or female, whether a free person or slave from the Muslims. However, this tradition has also been narrated by Ayyub Sakhtiyani and 'Ubaid Allah ibn 'Umar, without the addition \\"from the Muslims\\", hence the above-mentioned example due to the addition of \\"from the Muslims\\" in the text is classified as gharib. # Thirdly, a tradition may be declared gharib since it is narrated through various chains of transmitters but having within one of its chains an addition in the isnād. Impact on Islamic law There are differing views as to the level of knowledge achieved by each of the two primary categories mutawatir and ahaad. One view, expressed by Ibn Hajar and others, is that a hadith mutawatir achieves certain knowledge, while ahad hadith, unless otherwise corroborated, yields speculative knowledge upon which action is not mandated. A second view, held by Dawud al-Zahiri, Ibn Hazm and othersand, reportedly, the position of Malik ibn Anasis that hadith ahad achieves certain knowledge as well. According to Ibn Hazm, narration conveyed by a single, upright narrator conveying from another of a similar description until reaching the Prophet mandates both knowledge and action.\\"Al-Ba’ith al-Hathith Sharh Ikhtisar Ulum Al-Hadith, Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, vol. 1, pg. 126, Maktabah al-Ma’arif, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, first edition, 1996.  Terminology relating to the authenticity of a hadith  Ibn al-Salah said, \\"Hadith, in the view of scholars of this discipline, fall into the divisions of 'sound' (ṣaḥīḥ), 'fair' (ḥasan), and 'weak' (ḍaʻīf).\\" While these divisions are further broken down into sub- categories each with their own terminology, the final outcome is essentially to determine whether a particular hadith is ṣaḥīḥ or ḍaʻīf. The individual terms are numerous, with Ibn al-Salah including sixty-five in his Introduction to the Science of Hadith and then commenting: \\"This is the end of them, but not the end of what is possible, as this is subject to further particularization to an innumerable extent.\\" Al-Bulqini commented on this by saying, \\"We have added five more categories, making it seventy.\\" Ibn al- Mulaqqin counted the various types as being \\"more than eighty\\"Al-Tathkirah fi 'Ulum al-Hadith, Dar 'Ammaar, Jordan, first edition, 1988. and al-Suyuti included ninety-three in Tadrib al-Rawi. Muḥammad al-Ḥāzimī acknowledged the numerous terms, reaching almost 100 by his own count, saying: \\"Be aware that the science of hadith consists of numerous types reaching almost a hundred. Each type is an independent discipline in and of itself and were a student to devote his life to them he would not reach their end.\\"  Ṣaḥīḥ Ṣaḥīḥ () may be translated as \\"authentic\\"Google Translate or \\"sound.\\" Ibn Hajar defines a hadith that is ṣaḥīḥ lidhātihi (\\"ṣaḥīḥ in and of itself\\") as a singular narration (ahaad; see below) conveyed by a trustworthy, completely competent person, either in his ability to memorize or to preserve what he wrote, with a muttaṣil (\\"connected\\") isnād (\\"chain of narration\\") that contains neither a serious concealed flaw (ʻillah)علة nor irregularity (shādhdh). He then defines a hadith that is ṣaḥīḥ lighairihi (\\"ṣaḥīḥ due to external factors\\") as a hadith \\"with something, such as numerous chains of narration, strengthening it.\\"Nuzhah al-Nuthr, published with Al-Nukat by 'Ali ibn Hasan, pg. 82, Dar ibn al-Jawzi, al-Damam, 6th edition. Ibn Hajar's definitions indicate that there are five conditions to be met for a particular hadith to be considered ṣaḥīḥ: # Each narrator in the chain of narration must be trustworthy; # Each narrator must be reliable in his ability to preserve that narration, be it in his ability to memorize to the extent that he can recall it as he heard it, or, that he has written it as he heard it and has preserved that written document unchanged; # The isnād must be connected (muttasil) insofar as it is at least possible for each narrator in the chain to have received the hadith from a predecessor; # The hadith, including its isnād, is free of ʻillah (hidden detrimental flaw or flaws, e.g. the establishment that two narrators, although contemporaries, could not have shared the hadith, thereby breaking the isnād.) # The hadith is free of irregularity, meaning that it does not contradict another hadith already established (accepted). A number of books were authored in which the author stipulated the inclusion of ṣaḥīḥ hadith alone. According to Sunni Islam, which reflects the beliefs followed by 80–90% of adherents of Islam worldwide, this was only achieved by the first two books in the following list: # Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. Considered the most authentic book after the Quran. # Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim. Considered the next most authentic book after Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. # Ṣaḥīḥ ibn Khuzaymah. Al-Suyuti was of the opinion that Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Khuzaymah was at a higher level of authenticity than Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān.Tadrib al-Rawi, vol. 1, pg. 148, Dar al-'Asimah, Riyadh, first edition, 2003. # Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān. Al-Suyuti also concluded that Ṣaḥīḥ Ibn Ḥibbān was more authentic than Al-Mustadrak alaa al-Ṣaḥīḥain. # al-Mustadrak ʻalā al- Ṣaḥīḥayn, by Hakim al-Nishaburi. # Al-Āhādith al-Jiyād al-Mukhtārah min mā laysa fī Ṣaḥīḥain by Ḍiyāʼ al-Dīn al-Maqdisī, authenticity considered. Different branches of Islam refer to different collections of hadiths or give preference to different ones.  Ḥasan Ḥasan ( meaning \\"good\\") is used to describe hadith whose authenticity is not as well-established as that of ṣaḥīḥ hadith, but sufficient for use as supporting evidence. Ibn Hajar defines a hadith that is ḥasan lithatihi\\"ḥasan in and of itself\\"with the same definition a ṣaḥīḥ hadith except that the competence of one of its narrators is less than complete; while a hadith that is ḥasan ligharihi (\\"ḥasan due to external factors\\") is determined to be ḥasan due to corroborating factors such as numerous chains of narration. He states that it is then comparable to a ṣaḥīḥ hadith in its religious authority. A ḥasan hadith may rise to the level of being ṣaḥīḥ if it is supported by numerous isnād (chains of narration); in this case that hadith would be ḥasan lithatihi (\\"ḥasan in and of itself\\") but, once coupled with other supporting chains, becomes ṣaḥīḥ ligharihi (\\"ṣaḥīḥ due to external factors\\").Nuzhah al-Nuthr, published as Al-Nukat, pg. 91–92, Dar ibn al-Jawzi, al-Damam, 6th edition. Related terms Musnad The early scholar of hadith, Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Hakim, defines a musnad ( meaning \\"supported\\") hadith as: =Musnad format of hadith collection= A musnad hadith should not be confused with the type of hadith collection similarly termed musannaf, which is arranged according to the name of the companion narrating each hadith. For example, a musnad might begin by listing a number of the hadith, complete with their respective sanads, of Abu Bakr, and then listing a number of hadith from Umar, and then Uthman ibn Affan and so on. Individual compilers of this type of collection may vary in their method of arranging those Companions whose hadith they were collecting. An example of this type of book is the Musnad of Ahmad.  Muttaṣil Muttaṣil () refers to a continuous chain of narration in which each narrator has heard that narration from his teacher.Nuzhah al-Nuthr, published with Al- Nukat by 'Ali ibn Hasan, pg. 83, Dar ibn al-Jawzi, al-Damam, 6th edition.  Ḍaʻīf Ḍaʻīf () is the categorization of a hadith as \\"weak\\". Ibn Hajar described the cause of a hadith being classified as weak as \\"either due to discontinuity in the chain of narrators or due to some criticism of a narrator.\\"Nuzhah al-Nuthr, published with Al-Nukat, pg. 108, Dar ibn al-Jawzi, al-Damam, 6th edition. This discontinuity refers to the omission of a narrator occurring at different positions within the isnād and is referred to using specific terminology accordingly as discussed below. Categories of discontinuity = Muʻallaq= Discontinuity in the beginning of the isnād, from the end of the collector of that hadith, is referred to as muʻallaq ( meaning \\"suspended\\"). Muʻallaq refers to the omission of one or more narrators. It also refers to the omission of the entire isnād, for example, (an author) saying only: \\"The Prophet said...\\" In addition, this includes the omission of the isnād except for the companion, or the companion and successor together. =Mursal= Mursal ( meaning \\"sent or transmitted\\"): if the narrator between the Successor and Muhammad is omitted from a given isnād, the hadith is mursal, e.g., when a Successor says, \\"The Prophet said ...\\" Since Sunnis believe in the uprightness of all Sahaba, they do not view it as a necessary problem if a Successor does not mention what Sahaba he received the hadith from. This means that if a hadith has an acceptable chain all the way to a Successor, and the successor attributes it to an unspecified companion, the isnād is considered acceptable. There are, however, different views in some cases: If the Successor is a young one and it is probable that he omitted an elder Successor who in turn reported from a companion. The opinion held by Imam Malik and all Maliki jurists is that the mursal of a trustworthy person is valid, just like a musnad hadith. This view has been developed to such an extreme that to some of them, the mursal is even better than the musnad, based on the following reasoning: \\"The one who reports a musnad hadith leaves you with the names of the reporters for further investigation and scrutiny, whereas the one who narrates by way of irsal (the absence of the link between the successor and the Prophet), being a knowledgeable and trustworthy person himself, has already done so and found the hadith to be sound. In fact, he saves you from further research.\\" Others reject the mursal of a younger Successor. = Muʻḍal= Muʻḍal ( meaning \\"problematic\\") describes the omission of two or more consecutive narrators from the isnād.Nuzhah al-Nuthr, published with Al-Nukat by 'Ali ibn Hasan, pg. 112, Dar ibn al-Jawzi, al-Damam, 6th edition. = Munqaṭiʻ= A hadith described as munqaṭiʻ ( meaning \\"disconnected\\") is one in which the chain of people reporting the hadith (the isnād) is disconnected at any point. The isnād of a hadith that appears to be muttaṣil but one of the reporters is known to have never heard hadith from his immediate authority, even though they lived at the same time, is munqaṭiʻ. It is also applied when someone says \\"A man told me...\\". Other types of weakness =Munkar= Munkar ( meaning \\"denounced\\") – According to Ibn Hajar, if a narration which goes against another authentic hadith is reported by a weak narrator, it is known as munkar. Traditionists as late as Ahmad used to simply label any hadith of a weak reporter as munkar. = Shādhdh= Shādhdh ( meaning \\"anomalous\\") — According to al-Shafi'i, a shādhdh hadith is one which is reported by a trustworthy person who contradicts the narration of a person more reliable than he is. It does not include a hadith which is unique in its matn and is not narrated by someone else. = Muḍṭarib= Muḍṭarib ( meaning \\"shaky\\") – According to Ibn Kathir, if reporters disagree about a particular shaikh, or about some other points in the isnād or the matn, in such a way that none of the opinions can be preferred over the others, and thus there is irreconcilable uncertainty, such a hadith is called muḍṭarib. An example is the following hadith attributed to Abu Bakr: > \\"O Messenger of Allah! I see you getting older?\\" He (may Allah bless him and > grant him peace) replied, \\"What made me old are Surah Hud and its sister > surahs.\\" The hadith scholar Al-Daraqutni commented: \\"This is an example of a muḍṭarib hadith. It is reported through Abu Ishaq, but as many as ten different opinions are held regarding this isnād. Some report it as mursal, others as muttasil; some take it as a narration of Abu Bakr, others as one of Sa'd or ʻA'ishah. Since all these reports are comparable in weight, it is difficult to prefer one above another. Hence, the hadith is termed as muḍṭarib.\\" = Mawḍūʻ= A hadith that is mawḍūʻ () is one determined to be fabricated and cannot be attributed to its origin. Al-Dhahabi defines mawḍūʻ as a hadith of which the text contradicts established norms of the Prophet's sayings or of which the reporters include a liar. Recognizing fabricated hadith # Some of these hadith were known to be spurious by the confession of their inventors. For example, Muhammad ibn Sa\`id al-Maslub used to say, \\"It is not wrong to fabricate an isnād for a sound statement.\\" Another notorious inventor, ʻAbd al-Karim Abu 'l-Auja, who was killed and crucified by Muhammad ibn Sulaiman ibn ʻAli, governor of Basra, admitted that he had fabricated four thousand hadith declaring lawful the prohibited and vice versa. # Mawḍūʻ narrations are also recognised by external evidence related to a discrepancy found in the dates or times of a particular incident. For example, when the second caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab decided to expel the Jews from Khaybar, some Jewish dignitaries brought a document to Umar attempting to prove that the Prophet had intended that they stay there by exempting them from the jizya (tax on non-Muslims under the rule of Muslims); the document carried the witness of two companions, Sa'd ibn Mua'dh and Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan. Umar rejected the document outright, knowing that it was fabricated because the conquest of Khaybar took place in 6 AH, whereas Sa'd ibn Mua'dh died in 5 AH just after the Battle of the Trench, and Mu'awiyah embraced Islam in 8 AH, after the conquest of Mecca. Causes of fabrication There are several factors which may motivate an individual to fabricate a narration: * political differences; * factions based on issues of creed; * fabrications by heretics; * fabrications by story-tellers; * fabrications by ignorant ascetics; * prejudice in favour of town, race or a particular leader; * inventions for personal motives; * the desire to promote proverbs into hadith; * fabrications to psychologically destroy initiative and ingenuity; * fabrications to lower the standing of the last Messenger; * fabrications to create convolutions in Islam and induce a chronic feeling of guilt in the Muslim mind; * fabrications to establish Hadith literature as a source of religion through Hadith itself; * fabrications to cast doubts on the text of Quran. Collections A number of hadith specialists have collected fabricated hadith separately in order to distinguish them from other hadith. Examples include: * Al-Maudu\`at by Abul-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi. * Kitab al-Abatil by al-Jauraqany. * Al-La'ali al- Masnu'ah fi 'l-Ahadith al-Mawduʻah by al- Suyuti. * Al-Mawduʻat by Ali al-Qari. * Al-Fawaid al-Majmu'ah fi al-Ahaadeeth al-Mawdu'ah by Muhammad ash-Shawkani.  Sunni hadith terminology literature As in any Islamic discipline, there is a rich history of literature describing the principles and fine points of hadith studies.

Where much has been uncovered, such as various houses, a reservoir, cemetery, and roads\\".http://www.epirusforallseasons.gr/portfolio/ancient-orraon Orraon was founded in the 4th century B.C. while Alcetas I was king. This was the period of the Classical period and Hellenistic period. In 167 BC the Romans destroyed Orraon, but was rebuilt shortly afterwards.http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/08/12/orraon-ancient-greeces- best-preserved-settlement/ The city of Orraon lasted for a short period of time. In 37 BC the town had one hundred houses, twelve streets, and a grave yard. Orraon was abandoned by its people. Its inhabitants were forced to settle in Nicopolis which is located in the south western part of Greece. The city of Nicopolis was founded by Augustus after his victory in the Battle of Actium.http://www.gtp.gr/TDirectoryDetails.asp?ID=14891 Horreum was mentioned by the historian Livy. Archaeology In Orraon “most of the houses are still standing two story high and the street plan is still visible\\".http://www.itia.ntua.gr/ahw/work/70/ In the town plan twelve narrow parallel streets, in north and south direction, cross two wider streets.http://www.itia.ntua.gr/ahw/work/70/ By the way the streets run form an oblong town blocks, the insula, and fifteen meters wide.http://www.itia.ntua.gr/ahw/work/70/ The settlement consisted of 100 houses, built of local limestone.A Companion to Greek Architecture: By John Wiley & Sons, 2016, p.274 One house occupies the full width of each insula. Some pieces of the houses still remain today. The main parts that are visible today are the stone the houses were made of, window frames, door frames, and a few more features of the house are still visible. Everybody in the town of Orraon used a cistern. The cistern was located near the main gate, which was located in the northeast part of town. The cistern was located in this area because it was the highest point of altitude in the city.http://www.itia.ntua.gr/ahw/work/70/ They had a closure wall located around the cistern. They put the antae frame placed at the south wall of the tank, and the straight stairs at the northeastern corner of the tank. The stairs helped them to get to the bottom of the tank to clean it as well as getting water out of the tank. The wall was built out of rectangular stones, and limestone. The wall was higher than the cistern to keep people from throwing trash into the tank. Molossians MG 3520 Aftermath Orraon is a very old historical place. It helped protect the Basin in Greece. It was destroyed by the Romans, but was built back very quickly.http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/08/12/orraon-ancient-greeces- best-preserved-settlement/ After being built back Orraon did not last much longer because the inhabitants was forced to leave because Augustus had won the battle of Actium’s. Some of the remains still remain today. The remains in conclude the stones, some door frames, and windows that was left of the old homes. Some streets and roads are still visible today.

Multiaxis machining is a manufacturing process that involves tools that move in 4 or more directions and are used to manufacture parts out of metal or other materials by milling away excess material, by water jet cutting or by laser cutting. This type of machining was originally performed mechanically on large complex machines. These machines operated on 4, 5, 6, and even 12 axes which were controlled individually via levers that rested on cam plates. The cam plates offered the ability to control the tooling device, the table in which the part is secured, as well as rotating the tooling or part within the machine. Due to the machines size and complexity it took extensive amounts of time to set them up for production. Once computer numerically controlled machining was introduced it provided a faster, more efficient method for machining complex parts. Typical CNC tools support translation in 3 axis; multiaxis machines also support rotation around one or multiple axis. 5-axis machines are commonly used in industry in which the workpiece is translated linearly along three axes (typically x, y, and z) and the tooling spindle is capable of rotation about an addition 2 axes. There are now many CAM (computer aided manufacturing) software systems available to support multiaxis machining including software that can automatically convert 3-axis toolpaths into 5-axis toolpaths.MCADCafé. Sescoi's WorkNC 5-Axis and Auto 5 - a competitive advantage at ALLIO. Prior to the advancement of Computer Aided Manufacturing, transferring information from design to production often required extensive manual labor, generating errors and resulting in wasted time and material. There are three main components to multiaxis machines: # The machines physical capabilities i.e. torque, spindle speed, axis orientation/operation. # The CNC drive system, the components that move the machine. This includes servo- motors, rapid traverse systems, ball screws, and how positioning is monitored. # The CNC controller, this is how data is transferred/stored within machine, and input data is processed and executed.https://search.proquest.com/docview/1269154092 Multiaxis machines offer several improvements over other CNC tools, at the cost of increased complexity and price of the machine: * The amount of human labor is reduced, if the piece would otherwise have to be turned manually during the machining. * A better surface finish can be obtained by moving the tool tangentially about the surface (as opposed to moving the workpiece around the spindle). * More complex parts can be manufactured, particularly parts with curved holes. * Increased tool life due to the ability to achieve optimal angles between the tool and machining surface. * Higher quality parts. What once required multiple setups now can be executed in only a few if not one, reducing steps and decreasing the opportunity for error. The number of axes for multiaxis machines varies from 4 to 9.Karlo Apro (2008). Secrets of 5-Axis Machining. Industrial Press Inc. . Each axis of movement is implemented either by moving the table (into which the workpiece is attached), or by moving the tool. The actual configuration of axes varies, therefore machines with the same number of axes can differ in the movements that can be performed.  Applications  Common applications for 5-axes machining include complex 3D geometry like turbine blades, cutting tools, and parts that require interior cuts that would be otherwise inaccessible with a simple 3-axis setup. Given that the two additional axes allow for angling of the spindle head relative to the machining surface it is also often used to machine sloped surfaces into part features.

Boyce in the fall of 1900.Shapiro, \\"You can quote them.\\" Though the claim was disputed by Marckwald (who was credited with the tune in the 1901 Class Book) and others, the weight of the evidence (including several articles in the Yale Alumni Weekly from 1900 and 1901) supports Hirsh's claim. However, the song appears to be based on an earlier one, \\"La Hoola Boola\\" (1898), by Robert Allen \\"Bob\\" Cole and Billy Johnson, \\"extremely popular African American singer-songwriters of the time.\\" When the first piano edition of \\"Yale Boola\\" appeared in 1901, it included a notice \\"Adapted by permission of Howley, Haviland & Dresser\\" (the successor publisher of \\"La Hoola Boola\\"), and Hirsh himself said in his 1930 letter: \\"The song was not altogether original with us, but was undoubtedly adapted from some other song but we were unable to definitively designate this song, although later on we did discover that there had been published a song, which at that time was out of print, called 'La Hula Boola,' and the air was quite similar but the time was different.\\" The song immediately caught on,“A small band of students on the Yale side of the ring sang their college songs. “More work for the undertaker and no hope for Pennsy” was the theme of one refrain, while the stately measures of “Boola-boola” were pleasing to the auditors.” New York Times, February 3, 1901 soon being played by John Philip Sousa.

It used magnetic core memory and transistor technologies and it is claimed to be the first large commercial transistorised machine in the UK. Core memory was a matrix of laced ferrite cores. Because transistors were relatively slow at that time, Hounsfield also used magnetic logic units to speed up the operation of the machine to achieve a processing power comparable with a valve/tube computer. These logic units consisted of a single ferrite ring (toroid), with up to fifteen connections to it. Main storage capacity was 1,024 36-bit words - just over 4k bytes. Secondary storage was provided by magnetic drums, each of 4,096 words - about 20k. Anything else was stored on magnetic tape mounted in the vertical drive, vacuum-sealed behind a glass door. Peripherals included punched tape readers, punched card readers, and line printers. 24 EMIDEC 1100 computers were sold to commercial customers including Domestic Electric Rentals, Boots, British Motor Corporation, Kodak Limited, London Transport and the Admiralty. They were used for a range of commercial and industrial applications. In July 1962 EMI Computing Services Division became part of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) which merged with other UK computer companies in 1968 to become International Computers Limited (ICL).

It lies on the River Mease, about north of Tamworth. There is an Early English church, dedicated to St Matthew, and a public house, the White Lion. Harlaston is a conservation area, and has won the Staffordshire Best Kept Small Village award 5 times. History The name Harlaston comes from Old English, and means either Heoruwulfs farm or Heorulafs farm. It has been suggested that the church goes back to the 11th century and is of Anglo-Saxon origin. Certainly, a corn mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Until 1845 Harlaston was a chapelry of the parish of Clifton Campville, after which date it became an independent ecclesiastical parish. In 1851 the population was 221, on about 1400 acres of land. There were 2 lords of the manor, Captain Theophilus Levett and W Chettle, though much of the land belonged to other people. Governance The township of Harlaston became part of Tamworth Poor Law Union in 1836. In 1866 it also became a civil parish in its own right, becoming part of Tamworth Rural District in 1894. During the boundary changes of 1934, the parish was extended to incorporate Haselour, becoming part of Lichfield Rural District. In 1974 it became part of the new non-metropolitan district of Lichfield. Electorally the parish is part of Mease and Tame ward of Lichfield District, and lies within the parliamentary constituency of Tamworth. Landmarks Harlaston includes a number of historic buildings. Listed Grade II* is the parish church of St Matthew; grade II listings include the Manor House, as well as several other houses, mileposts, and a telephone box. The Church is mainly built of red brick in Norman and Early English styles. There is a tower with three bells and a clock. The upper part of the tower is half-timbered - this is said to be unusual for Staffordshire. A small spire was added in the 19th century. The Old Rectory alongside the church dates from 1842. The Manor House dates back to 1540. It is of traditional timber construction. The Homestead dates back to 1773. It was built by William Mercer, a harness maker. It may have once also been the village pub, the Whip and Saddle. Other Settlements Haselour is an ancient manor and hamlet about a mile west of Harlaston. The name Haselour comes from Old English and means hazel ridge. In 1851 it was described as having a population of 29 people in 5 houses, and covered . The area was extra-parochial and the people were served by the chapel at Harlaston. For local government purposes Haselour was extra-parochial until 1858, when it became a civil parish within Lichfield Poor Law Union. In 1894 it became part of Lichfield Rural District; in 1934 the civil parish was incorporated into Harlaston. Listed Grade II* are Haselour Hall and its associated chapel. The manor house of Haselour Hall, with its traditional half-timbered Tudor appearance, dates back to the 16th century. The chapel dates from the 14th century, and was restored in the 1880s, but is now in poor condition and is on the English Heritage at risk register. The now-closed Elford railway station was originally named Haselour.

Kniplová possessed a large voice with a sonorous, metallic, dark timbre that was particularly well suited to the dramatic soprano repertoire. While she was most admired in Czech operas and as Wagnerian heroines, she sang a wide repertoire that also encompassed Italian, Russian, and Hungarian language roles. A fine actress, her performances were praised for their intensity and pathos. However, some critics commented on a certain lack of steadiness or purity in her singing. Her voice is preserved on a number of recordings made on the Supraphon and Decca labels. Biography Born in Ostrava to a musical family, Kniplová had her first vocal training from her father before studying under Jarmila Vavrdová at the Prague Conservatory from 1947 to 1953. She pursued further studies at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague from 1954 to 1958 where her principal teachers were Zdeněk Otava and K. Ungrová. She made her professional opera debut at the opera house in Ústí nad Labem in the title role of Smetana's Libuše in 1957. In 1958 she won the Geneva International Singing Competition. Kniplová joined the roster of principal singers at the Mahen Theatre in Brno in 1959, remaining with the company through 1964. During her tenure there the opera company moved to a new building, the Janáček Theatre in 1961. Among the roles she performed there were Emilia Marty in Janáček's The Makropulos Affair, Judith in Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle, Katerina in Martinů's The Greek Passion, Kostelnička Buryjovka in Janáček's Jenůfa, Renata in Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel, and the title heroines Libuše and Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. During that period, she also appeared as a guest at the Semperoper in Dresden, where she drew particular acclaim for the title role in Verdi's Aida. In 1965 Kniplová became a principal soprano at the Prague National Theatre (PNT), where her first role was Ortrud in Wagner's Lohengrin. The PNT remained her principal home for more than two decades. She expanded her repertoire by Anežka in The Two Widows, Brünnhilde in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, Eva in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Isolde in Tristan und Isolde, Kundry in Parsifal, Lady Macbeth in Verdi's Macbeth, Leonora in Beethoven's Fidelio, Milada in Smetana's Dalibor, Senta in Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer, and the title roles in Janáček's Káťa Kabanová, Fibich's Šárka, and Puccini's Tosca and Turandot. While committed to the PNT, Kniplová was also highly active as a guest artist at international opera stages. In 1965 she appeared at the Berlin State Opera and traveled with that house for performances in Tokyo. In 1966 she gave lauded performances at the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Hamburg State Opera. She had a major success in 1967 as Brünnhilde in the Ring cycle at the Salzburg Easter Festival conducted by Herbert von Karajan. In 1971 she appeared at the Salzburg Festival as the soprano soloist in the Janáček's Glagolitic Mass. She appeared as Isolde at the Liceu, as Brünnhilde at the Teatro Regio di Torino and the San Francisco Opera, as Isolde and Kostelnička at the Vienna State Opera, also at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, and the Canadian Opera Company. Retired from the stage, Kniplová served on the voice faculty at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. Among her notable pupils was mezzo-soprano Andrea Kalivodová. Kniplová was selected for the lifetime achievement award in opera at the 2010 Thalia Awards, however she refused the award stating that she should have received it sooner.

The screenplay by Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmorea is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. The film stars Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The film centers on a group of young people who defend their hometown from a North Korean invasion. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced its intention to remake Red Dawn in May 2008 and subsequently hired Bradley and Ellsworth. The principal characters were cast the following year and the film went into production in September 2009 in Mount Clemens, Michigan. Originally scheduled to be released on November 24, 2010, the film was shelved because of MGM's financial troubles. While in post- production, the invading army and antagonists were changed from Chinese to North Korean in order to maintain access to the Chinese box office, though the film was still not released in China. Because of MGM's bankruptcy, the distribution rights were sold to FilmDistrict in September 2011 and the film was released in the United States on November 21, 2012 to mostly negative reviews. The film is also a box-office failure, grossing $50.9 million from its $65 million budget. Plot An introductory montage shows the fallout of an economic crisis in the European Union and a weakened NATO alliance, amid increasing cooperation between an increasingly militant North Korea and ultranationalist-controlled Russia. The increased deployment of U.S. troops abroad leaves the mainland vulnerable. U.S. Marine Jed Eckert is home on leave in Spokane, Washington. He reunites with his father, Spokane Police Sergeant Tom Eckert and his brother, football player Matt Eckert, as well as his childhood friend Toni Walsh and her cousin Erica Martin, Matt's girlfriend. The morning after a mysterious power outage, Jed and Matt are shocked to see swarms of invading North Korean paratroopers and transport aircraft. Their father tells them to flee to their cabin in the woods while he helps the townspeople. They are joined there by Robert Kitner, Daryl Jenkins, Danny Jackson, siblings Julie and Greg Goodyear, and Pete, and later by Toni; Erica is captured by the North Koreans. Tensions build as the teens try to decide whether to surrender to the invaders or resist, with Pete ending up betraying their position. North Korean soldiers, under the command of Captain Cho, bring Sergeant Eckert and the mayor out to convince the group to surrender; while the mayor persuades the boys to give up, Cho executes Sergeant Eckert after he refuses to cooperate and actively encourages them to resist. Later, Jed announces that he intends to fight and the others agree to join him, calling themselves the Wolverines after their school mascot. After acquiring weapons, establishing a base in an abandoned mine, and being trained by Jed, the Wolverines begin a series of guerrilla attacks against soldiers and collaborators, including Pete. As Matt manages to free Erica from her imprisonment, he jeopardizes the mission resulting in Greg's death. The North Koreans retaliate by bombarding the surrounding woods to destroy the Wolverines' base, killing Danny and Julie, with the remaining survivors fleeing deeper into the woods. The Wolverines eventually encounter Marine Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner and two other Marines, Corporal Smith and Sergeant Hodges. They reveal that the Russian-backed North Korean invasion used an EMP weapon that crippled the U.S. electrical grid and military, followed by landings along the east and west coasts (Camp Pendleton is hinted by the Marines as having been destroyed in the invasion, as most likely was the rest of coastal Southern California), with American counterattacks eventually halting their advances, leaving an area stretching from Michigan to Montana and Alabama to Arizona as \\"Free America\\", using the Rocky Mountains in the west and the Appalachians in the east as geographic buffers, as pockets of patriotic guerrillas in the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada mountains continue to fight. They also reveal that Captain Cho's suitcase contains an EMP- resistant radio telephone, that if captured would enable the U.S. command to listen in on enemy communication, and gain a tactical advantage in a counter- offensive. The Wolverines assist Tanner, Smith, and Hodges in infiltrating the local police station, the North Koreans' center of operations. They succeed in stealing the suitcase with Jed avenging his father's death by killing Cho, though Hodges is killed in the firefight. After they successfully escape with the suitcase, the Wolverines and Marines regroup in a safe house. After a brief conversation between Jed and Matt, however, they are ambushed by Russian Spetsnaz and Jed is killed in the firefight. Visibly shaken, Matt and the rest of the group escape with the suitcase. Robert realizes that during the escape from the police station, Daryl was tagged with a subcutaneous tracking device that the Russians used to find them. After some thought, Daryl accepts the fact that he cannot go on with them and decides to stay behind, his fate unknown. The rest continue on to the Marines's extraction point. Tanner and Smith depart in a UH-1 with the suitcase. The remaining Wolverines decide to stay behind and continue to fight, recruiting more members and raiding prisoner camps, with Matt now leading the effort to continue opposing the occupation. The flag of \\"Free America\\" is carried by patriots in a daring raid on a North Korean concentration camp in the final shot of the film.

MGM subsequently announced that Red Dawn would be remade \\"keeping in mind the post-9/11 world that we're in\\". Later the same month, MGM announced that Dan Bradley had been confirmed as the director with Carl Ellsworth, screenwriter of Red Eye and Disturbia, writing the updated screenplay. Ellsworth worked from a story written by Jeremy Passmore. Vincent Newman (A Man Apart) was announced as the producer. Australian Chris Hemsworth was cast in a lead role: other cast members include Josh Peck, Adrianne Palicki, Josh Hutcherson, Isabel Lucas, Edwin Hodge, and Connor Cruise. Principal photography began September 2009 in Mount Clemens, Michigan. The closed Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan (Greater Detroit) was used as a filming location.Binelli, p. 260. Mark Binelli, author of Detroit City is the Place to Be, wrote that the school cafeteria was used as the catering hall for the employees.Binelli, p. 260-261. According to photographs taken on set, the film features propaganda pamphlets, posters, and banners featuring People's Liberation Army symbols, such as the August 1 star. The posters attempt to garner support for a Chinese occupation, with slogans such as \\"Rebuilding Your Reputation\\", \\"Repairing Your Economy\\", and \\"Fighting Corporate Corruption\\". In June 2010, release of the film was delayed by MGM’s financial difficulties. The delay came amid growing controversy in China after excerpts of the script were leaked on the website The Awl. The film drew sharp criticism from the Global Times, one of the leading Chinese state-run newspapers, with headlines such as \\"U.S. reshoots Cold War movie to demonize China\\" and \\"American movie plants hostile seeds against China\\". One of the articles stated: \\"China can still feel U.S. distrust and fear, especially among its people. Americans' suspicions about China are the best ground for the hawks to disseminate fear and doubt, which is the biggest concern with the movie, Red Dawn.\\" In January 2011, the first cast photo was released along with news that MGM would release the film once their Chapter 11 restructuring is completed. Red Dawn was one of three already completed MGM projects scheduled to be released in 2011. In March 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that MGM changed the villains in its Red Dawn remake from Chinese to North Korean in order to maintain access to China's lucrative box office. The changes reportedly cost less than $1 million and involve changing an opening sequence summarizing the story's fictional backdrop (dropping the original storyline of Chinese \\"repossession\\" after the US defaults on loans for a North Korean invasion), re-editing two scenes, and using digital technology to change Chinese symbols and dialogue to Korean. The film's producer Trip Vinson stated: \\"We were initially very reluctant to make any changes, but after careful consideration we constructed a way to make a scarier, smarter and more dangerous Red Dawn that we believe improves the movie.\\" Soundtrack Ramin Djawadi composed the score to the film. Track listing All music by Ramin Djawadi. Release Dan Bradley, Adrianne Palicki, Josh Peck, Tripp Vinson and Fantastic Fest founder, Tim League at the world premiere of Red Dawn in Austin, Texas. In September 2011, it was reported that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was finalizing a deal with the independent studio FilmDistrict to distribute the film in the United States. In December 2011, FilmDistrict reached a deal to distribute its 2012 films including Red Dawn through Open Road Films. In September 2012, it was announced that the film would premiere on September 27, 2012 at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, closing out the Fantastic Fest film festival. Red Dawn opened in theaters in the United States on November 21, 2012. The film earned $7.4 million in its first two days and finished in seventh place, earning $14.6 million in its first weekend. The film closed in theaters on February 21, 2013, grossing a total $50.9 million worldwide. Red Dawn was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 5, 2013 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Reception , on Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 141 reviews and an average score of 3.88/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The rebooted Red Dawn lacks the original's topicality, but at least pays tribute in delivering the same short shrift to character development and general logic.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 31 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The film earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"An already silly premise is given a ham-fisted treatment in this ill- advised remake of John Milius' 1984 hit action film\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \\"Bradley... handles the low-fi action well, which helps divert attention from the bargain-bin special effects, bad acting and politics\\". Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"Reasonably dopey fun on its own, the remade Red Dawn simply can't stand up to the real-world issues it steps on like a land mine\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, \\"The story's time frame is confusingly murky. How long does it take the North Koreans to land... and start running things? What is their game plan? Is this a national invasion? We're unclear what's happening in the rest of the United States\\".

Before 2014 some insurance policies would not cover expenses due to pre-existing conditions. These exclusions by the insurance industry were meant to cope with adverse selection by potential customers. Such exclusions have been prohibited since January 1, 2014, by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than a quarter of adults below the age of 65 (approximately 52 million people) had pre-existing conditions in 2016.  Definitions  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center defines a pre-existing condition as a \\"medical condition that occurred before a program of health benefits went into effect\\". J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, has stated on a Fox News Sunday interview that exclusions, based upon these conditions, function as a form of \\"rationing\\" of health care. Conditions can be broken down into two further categories, according to Lisa Smith of Investopedia: Which definition may be used was sometimes regulated by state laws. Some states required insurance companies to use the objective standard, while others required the prudent person standard. 10 states did not specify either definition, 21 required the \\"prudent person\\" standard, and 18 required the \\"objective\\" standard. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than a quarter of adults below the age of 65 (approximately 52 million people) had pre-existing conditions in 2016.

After most states had by the early 1990s implemented some limits on pre-existing condition exclusions by small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Kassebaum-Kennedy Act) of 1996 (HIPAA) extended some minimal limits on pre- existing condition exclusions for all group health insurance plans—including the self-insured large group health insurance plans that cover half of those with employer-provided health insurance but are exempt from state insurance regulation. ; Individual (non-group) health insurance plans * Maximum pre- existing condition exclusion period (states that permitted elimination riders permanently excluding pre-existing conditions noted by italics and asterisk*) ** 6 months: Massachusetts, Oregon; New Mexico* 9 months: Washington; New Hampshire* 12 months: California, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Vermont; Colorado*, Connecticut*, Maryland*, Mississippi*, Montana*, North Carolina*, North Dakota*, Ohio*, Pennsylvania*, Rhode Island*, South Dakota*, Utah*, Virginia*, West Virginia*, Wyoming* 18 months: Minnesota ** 2 years: Alabama*, Florida*, Georgia*, Illinois*, Iowa*, Kansas*, South Carolina*, Tennessee*, Texas*, Wisconsin* 3 years: Hawaii* 10 years: Indiana ** unlimited: Alaska*, Arizona*, Arkansas*, Delaware*, District of Columbia*, Louisiana*, Missouri*, Nebraska*, Nevada*, Oklahoma* Elimination riders permanently excluding pre-existing conditions *** prohibited: California, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington *** permitted*: 37 other states and DC * Maximum look-back period for pre-existing conditions ** 3 months: New Hampshire ** 6 months: Idaho, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming ** 12 months: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia ** 2 years: Florida, Illinois, West Virginia ** 3 years: Montana, Rhode Island, ** 5 years: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Texas ** unlimited: Alaska, Arizona, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin ; Small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans * Maximum pre-existing condition exclusion period ** 0 months: Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan ** 3 months: Kansas ** 6 months: California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island ** 9 months: Indiana, New Hampshire, Washington ** 12 months: 36 other states + DC * Maximum look-back period for pre-existing conditions ** 0 months: Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan ** 3 months: Kansas, New Hampshire ** 6 months: 45 other states + DC ; Large group (self-insured) health insurance plans * Maximum pre-existing condition exclusion period ** 12 months: 50 states + DC * Maximum look-back period for pre-existing conditions ** 6 months: 50 states + DC Pre-existing condition exclusions were prohibited for HIPAA-eligible individuals (those with 18 months continuous coverage unbroken for no more than 63 days and coming from a group health insurance plan). Individual (non-group) health insurance plans could exclude maternity coverage for a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. Group health insurance plans sponsored by employers with 15 or more employees were prohibited by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 from excluding maternity coverage for a pre-existing condition of pregnancy; this prohibition was extended to all group health insurance plans by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Practice and effect  Advocates against pre-existing condition rules argue that they cruelly deny people in need of treatment. State Farm spokeswoman K.C. Eynatten has said, \\"We realized our position was based on gut feelings, not hard numbers... we became aware that we were part of the reason a woman and her children might not leave an abuser. They were afraid they'd lose their insurance. And we wanted no part of that.\\" Jerry Flanagan, health-care policy director of Consumer Watchdog, has stated that \\"insurance companies want premiums without any risk\\" and go to extreme \\"lengths... to go to make a profit\\". InsureMe, an insurance quote provider website, has argued that even though health insurance is basically to protect people from very high costs of health care, the commercial health insurance system is not playing fair and are always trying to avoid risk in order to boost their profits. Some practices by some health insurance companies, such as determining domestic violence to be an excludable pre- existing condition, have been called abuses by Maria Tchijov, a Service Employees International Union new media coordinator, and by an Office of Rural Health Policy report. The rationale behind pre-existing condition clauses, according to those who defend the policies, is that they reduce the cost of health insurance coverage for those who still receive it, thus giving more people an opportunity to afford insurance in the first place. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that \\"[c]osts for those with coverage could go up because people in poor health who'd been shut out of the insurance pool would now be included... they would get medical care they could not access before.\\" Senator Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming, has voted to allow insurance companies to consider domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and supported his vote by saying that covering such people could raise insurance premiums to the point where it would preclude others from buying it. He has remarked that \\"If you have no insurance, it doesn't matter what services are mandated by the state\\". According to the California-based advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, other possible situations falling under pre- existing condition clauses are chronic conditions as acne, hemorrhoids, toenail fungus, allergies, tonsillitis, and bunions, hazardous occupations such as police officer, stunt person, test pilot, circus worker, and firefighter, and pregnancy and/or the intention to adopt.  Commentary by lawmakers  According to a Reason.com libertarian opinion blog by Peter Suderman, the 'Pledge to America' issued by the Republican Party in September 2010 stated, \\"Health care should be accessible for all, regardless of pre- existing conditions or past illnesses.... We will make it illegal for an insurance company to deny coverage to someone with prior coverage on the basis of a pre-existing condition.\\" In a March 3, 2010, address, President Barack Obama said that coverage denied to those with pre-existing conditions is a serious problem that would only grow worse without major reforms. In a September 2010 visit with Falls Church, Virginia, residents, Obama referred to a woman with an eye condition and a woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as personal examples in the audience of those benefiting from changing pre- existing condition rules.  Public opinion  A Time Magazine-Abt SRBI poll in late July 2009 found that a large majority of Americans (80%) favored a requirement that insurance companies insure people even if they suffer from pre-existing conditions. In September 2009, the monthly Kaiser Health Tracking Poll report said:  See also  * Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan  References  Further reading  Category:Health insurance in the United States Category:Insurance law Category:Health policy Category:Social problems in medicine https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/trump-to-sign-executive-orders-on- preexisting-conditions-surprise-medical-billing.html ","title":"Pre-existing condition"},{"id":"24355247","text":"Martin Myles Filler (September 17, 1948) is a prominent American architecture critic. He is best known for his long essays on modern architecture that have appeared in The New York Review of Books since 1985, and which served as the basis for his 2007 book Makers of Modern Architecture, published by New York Review Books. Education Born in Colorado Springs, CO, Filler received a BA in Art History from Columbia College in 1970 and an MA from Columbia University's Department of Art History and Archaeology in 1972. Career Filler began his career in 1973 at Columbia University's Teachers College Press. From 1974 to 1977 he was the editor of Architectural Record Books at McGraw-Hill, where he produced anthologies of writings by Frank Lloyd Wright and Lewis Mumford. He began contributing book reviews to Architectural Record magazine in 1974, and three years later became an associate editor at Progressive Architecture. In 1979 Filler started his long association with Condé Nast Publications, where he was an editor of House & Garden until the magazine ceased publication in 2007. From 1990 to 1994 he was also a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, where he wrote profiles on major figures in the arts including Lucian Freud, Roy Lichtenstein, Paul Mellon, I.M. Pei, Irving Penn, and Jacob Rothschild. From 1999 to 2003 he was the architecture critic for The New Republic, and in that latter year was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Writing His writings on architecture, art, and design–more than 1,000 articles to date–have appeared in a broad range of periodicals, newspapers, scholarly journals, and exhibition catalogues in the United States, Europe, and Japan, including some 50 pieces for The New York Times. During the early 1980s, Art in America ran his eleven-part series on an emerging generation of avant-garde architects including Frank Gehry and others yet to achieve widespread recognition. Publications His 2007 book Makers of Modern Architecture was published by New York Review Books and Spanish-language edition, La arquitectura moderna y sus creadores, will be published by Alba in October 2012. Robert Hughes praised it as \\"by far the most intelligent and shapely writing on architecture done in recent years,\\" and called Filler the \\"one regular critic in the American press whose pieces are a guaranteed pleasure to revisit–or to read for the first time.\\"Robert Hughes. Master Builders. The New York Review of Books. Published: September 27, 2007, p.46-48 A second collection of his New York Review essays, Makers of Modern Architecture, Volume II, was published by New York Review Books in the fall of 2013. According to the historian George Baird, \\"In the wake of a significant shift in the tenor or architectural criticism . . . [Filler] can claim to have launched the new tone, and a new social orientation to architectural design . . . The strength of Filler's writing has steadily grown over time and . . . [i]t seems to me that he can now lay claim to the mantel of the late Ada Louise Huxtable, the most admired critic of recent times.\\"George Baird, \\"A Voice for Here and Now,\\" Architectural Record, September 2013, p.47 The series was further extended with the publication of Makers of Modern Architecture, Volume III in the fall of 2018. Filler's criticism is often acerbic and outspoken: in a New York Times Op-Ed Page piece he denounced the Gwathmey Siegel addition to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum as \\"the most appalling act of architectural vandalism since the demolition of Pennsylvania Station\\".Martin Filler.

Zaha Hadid correction From August 2014 until January 2015 he was the subject of a lawsuit by Zaha Hadid for erroneous comments he made in The New York Review of Books. Within days of the legal action, Filler issued a public statement stating, in part, “I wrote that an 'estimated one thousand laborers...have perished while constructing her project thus far' ...[when in fact] there have been no worker deaths on the Al Wakrah project.” He added that \\"I regret the error.\\" In early 2015 Hadid withdrew her complaint and under the terms of a confidential settlement agreement donated \\"an undisclosed sum of money to a charitable organization that protects and champions labor rights.\\"Suzanne Stephens and Anna Fixsen. \\"Case Closed: Zaha Hadid v.

As Baird noted, \\"It is hard to imagine that Filler's voice did not have a significant effect on the situation.\\"Baird, op cit. Personal life In 1978 he married the architectural historian Rosemarie Haag Bletter, with whom he collaborated on the Whitney show.

It is considered a preludeWładysław Filar, Wydarzenia Wołyńskie 1942-1944 to the ethnic cleansing of Poles in the Volhynia region by the UPA, and is recognized as the first mass murder committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the area. Estimates of the number of victims range from 149Wołyńskie inferno (in Polish) to 173.Tadeusz Piotrowski: Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn: Recollections of the Ukrainian Nationalist Ethnic Cleansing Campaign Against the Poles During World War II, McFarland & Company, 2000, .  Prelude  In the interbellum period, Parośla I, located in the community of Antonówka (there were two villages named Parośla in Antonówka, numbered I and II) was a Polish village with 26 households,Władysław Siemaszko, Ewa Siemaszko (2000). \\"Ludobójstwo dokonane przez nacjonalistów ukraińskich na ludności polskiej Wołynia 1939–1945\\" part of Sarny county in the Volhynian Voivodeship. A few days before the assault, a newly created unit of the UPA attacked the Polish village of Włodzimierzec. In a skirmish with auxiliary police (composed of Cossacks in Nazi German service), one German and three Cossacks were killed and six Cossacks taken prisoner. On the way to Parośla, Ukrainian nationalists murdered five inhabitants of the settlement of Wydymer who were working in the forest.Grzegorz Motyka, Ukraińska partyzantka 1942-1960, p. 190-191  Crime  Memorial plaque in Parosla, commemorating and listing the victims. According to statements of Polish survivors, a UPA unit entered the village pretending to be Soviet partisans. The men split up, entered the houses, and demanded food from the residents. Meanwhile, the village was surrounded, and all Poles passing through were also detained. Several UPA members stationed themselves in each household. After dinner, the UPA partisans ordered all the inhabitants to lay down and tied them up, under the pretext that they were about to carry out an assault on a nearby German rail transport and if the village inhabitants were found to be tied up, that would serve as proof for Germans, that Poles did not cooperate with the UPA in the attack. Not all the inhabitants of Parośla believed them, since some of them could speak Ukrainian, but being unarmed, they had no choice but to do as they were told. All of the Poles were murdered with knives and axes: old men, women, children (including a six-month-old baby stuck to a table). In the Kolodyński family home, the unit's commander first interrogated the six prisoners (the Cossacks taken at Włodzimierzec) before killing them with axes. Only 12 Poles survived, including a twelve-year-old boy named Witold Kołodyński, who suffered a cracked skull from an axe blow. The houses were looted and property was taken away on sleighs. Fifteen more Poles were killed by the same UPA unit shortly afterward on the road to the khutor of Tuptyn. The next day, Poles from neighboring villages discovered the bodies. Those wounded were taken to a hospital in Włodzimierzec. German soldiers came to the village, and the corpses were buried under their supervision. One of the perpetrators, P. Wasylenko, was caught by Soviets after the war and described the crime: \\"All Poles were cut into pieces, babies as well\\". In 1943, a cross was erected in the village to commemorate the massacre, but over time it eroded due to neglect. Years later, a local Ukrainian farmer, Antin Kowalczuk, erected another cross in a nearby forest, as well as an obelisk with information about the crime.

It lies about north-east of Tamworth and 6 miles south-west of Measham. The nucleus of the parish is the Thorpe estate. History The first part of the name is believed to be the Old Norse word thorp with the meaning outlying farm, indicative of the village's location within the Danelaw. The second element comes from the name of the family that was in possession of the land in the 13th century. The population of the estate parish is given as 42 in 1848, the land covering . In 1870 it is given as 54, living in 5 houses. Governance The parish of Thorpe Constantine became part of Tamworth Poor Law Union in 1836. In 1894 it became a civil parish within the newly constituted Tamworth Rural District. During the boundary changes of 1934 the civil parish was enlarged with the addition of Statfold and Syerscote, and became part of Lichfield Rural District. In 1974 it became part of the new non-metropolitan district of Lichfield. The parish council meets jointly with Clifton Campville. Electorally the parish is part of Mease and Tame ward of Lichfield District, and lies within the parliamentary constituency of Tamworth. Landmarks Thorpe Hall The manor house of Thorpe Hall is a privately owned Georgian style country mansion, and a Grade II listed building. William Ives, a successful Leicestershire vintner, bought Thorpe in 1631. His daughter and co-heir Jane married Richard Inge of Leicester, and the house became the Inge family home. The Inges were a prominent local family, five members of which served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire. Family members were Rectors of Netherseal and of Thorpe Constantine. Ives had built a three- storey, five-bayed mansion at Thorpe in 1651. In 1790 when another Inge family seat at Drakelow, Derbyshire was abandoned, Thorpe Hall was enlarged and improved. Two three-bayed, two-storeyed wings were added, and the main central block was decorated with balustrading and an entrance porch. The 1881 census discloses Rev George Inge and his family in residence with a staff of twenty- one. The family remained in occupation until at least 1925. Following the death of Hilda Mary Inge in 1953 the estate passed to the Lillingston family of Localsh. George David Inge-Innes-Lillingston was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1966. The property is now occupied by Hugh Inge-Innes- Lillingston and his wife Catherine. Church of St Constantine The parish church, dedicated to St Constantine, is a Grade II listed building. The church is in the grounds of the Hall, and has been an \\"estate church\\" since the 18th century, the parish being owned by the estate. These days it is only occasionally used for services. It is, however, a substantial building, with separate nave and chancel. Extensively rebuilt in 1883, and prior to that in the 18th century, parts of it may go back to the 14th century, including the tower with spire. The Inge family, owners of the estate, often supplied the rectors too. Other settlements The expansion of the civil parish in 1934 incorporated the civil parishes of Statfold and Syerscote, both of which settlements go back to early mediaeval times, though these days must be counted as former settlements. Statfold Statfold is an abandoned village, of which little trace now remains, though the listed manor house and church are still extant. Nowadays, the church has the status of a chapel; it is listed Grade II*. Syerscote Syerscote , roughly north-east of Tamworth and 3 miles west of Thorpe, is a former township of the parish of St Editha, Tamworth. In 1836 it became part of Tamworth Poor Law Union; in 1866 it became an independent civil parish within the union. In 1894 it entered Tamworth Rural District and in 1934 became part of Thorpe Constantine civil parish. In 1848 the population was 46, on . The farmhouse of Syerscote Manor is listed Grade II. The name is believed to derive from Old English, with the meaning of Sigerics cottages. In the Middle Ages Syerscote was a prebend that funded one of 5 canons to the then collegiate Church of St Editha, Tamworth. In 1291 this income was valued at £4 a year. These days Syerscote is within the Church of England parish of St Leonard, Wigginton.

The proposed act would have required the energy industry to disclose the chemical additives used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid. The gas industry opposed the legislation. The bill was introduced to both houses of the 111th United States Congress on June 9, 2009. The House bill was introduced by representatives Diana DeGette, D-Colo., Maurice Hinchey D-N.Y., and Jared Polis, D-Colo. The Senate version was introduced by senators Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The bill was re-introduced to both houses of the 112th United States Congress on March 15, 2011, by Representative Diana DeGette and Senator Bob Casey. Background The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) blames the lack of information about the contents of hydraulic fracturing fluid on the Energy Policy Act of 2005 because the law exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal water laws.Environmental Effects of Hydraulic Fracturing, Hunter Valley Protection Alliance, 2008. The Act calls for the \\"chemical constituents (but not the proprietary chemical formulas) used in the fracturing process.\\" Once these constituents are determined the information must be revealed to the public through the Internet. The FRAC Act would have required that in any case where a physician or a state finds that a medical emergency exists, and that the chemical formulas are needed to treat the ailing individual, the firm must disclose the chemical identity to the state or physician—even if that proprietary formula is a trade-secret chemical. Material Safety Data Sheets, required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under 29 CFR 1910.1200 are developed and made available to first responders and other emergency planning and response officials. The drilling industry opposed the FRAC Act bill. They stated that the bill would have created \\"an additional layer of regulation that is unneeded and cumbersome.\\"Advanced Resources International. Potential Economic and Energy Supply Impacts of Proposals to Modify Federal Environmental Laws Applicable to the U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Industry. Prepared for U.S. Department of Energy. January, 2009. The Independent Petroleum Association of America believes that states already sufficiently regulate hydraulic fracturing. Their research suggests that federal regulation could result in the addition of about $100,000 to each new natural gas well.Lustgarten, Abraham. FRAC Act — Congress Introduces Twin Bills to Control Drilling and Protect Drinking Water. ProPublica. June 9, 2009. Energy in Depth, a lobbying group, says the new regulation would be an \\"unnecessary financial burden on a single small- business industry, American oil, and natural gas producers.\\" This group also claims that the FRAC Act could result in half of the United States oil wells and one third of the gas wells being closed. Also, the bill could cause domestic gas production to drop by 245 billion cubic feet per year along with four billion dollars in lost revenue to the federal government.Tronche, John Laurent. \\"U.S. Representatives Unveil FRAC Act to close 'Halliburton Loophole.'\\" Fort Worth Business Press. June 9, 2009. www.fwbusiness.com. The Environmental Protection Agency claims that the Safe Drinking Water Act is flexible in that it defers regulation of fracturing and drilling to the state. According to an industry-funded study, since most states currently have regulations on fracturing, they would most likely agree with the state's policy and there would not be much change. Current status The 111th United States Congress adjourned on January 3, 2011, without taking any significant action on the FRAC Act. The bill was re-introduced in both houses of the 112th United States Congress. In the Senate, Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced S. 587 on March 15, 2011.H.R. 1084: S. 587: FRAC Act In the House, Rep.

Musicologist Alena Němcová stated that, \\"Otava's voice had a very wide vocal range and a marked intensity, and while light, was extremely varied in colour, with an even tone, free of vibrato; his diction was absolutely clear.\\" In addition to his opera career, he was also a successful recitalist, particularly known for his performances of the contemporary Czech repertoire. His voice is preserved on a number of recordings made on the Supraphon label.Zdenek, Otava Biography at operissimo.com (in German) Biography Born in Vítějeves, worked as a choirboy in Brno where his singing drew the praise of Leoš Janáček. In his youth he studied violin and piano with Bohuslav Martinů. He initially wanted to become a teacher like his father and attended the College of Education in Brno, at which time he pursued further music studies privately with Janáček. After singing lessons with Bohumil Benoni in Prague, he studied opera further in Rome with Riccardo Stracciari and then in Milan and Vienna. In 1925 he made his professional opera début at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava as Iago in Otello. A year later was engaged by the Mahen Theatre in Brno with which he sang Baron Prus in the première of Janáček’s The Makropulos Affair and the title role in Ernst Krenek’s Jonny spielt auf. From 1929 to 1972 Otava worked at the Prague National Theatre, singing more than 160 roles; he also toured widely abroad. With his striking stage presence, he excelled in portrayals of Germont in La traviata, Pizarro in Fidelio, Scarpia in Tosca, Telramund in Lohengrin, and the title heroes in The Marriage of Figaro and Eugene Onegin. He also was highly successful in the Czech repertory, and learnt a large number of contemporary roles. In 1949 he performed in the world premiere of František Škroup's Columbus (composed 1855). Otava was also a highly respected voice teacher. He taught at the Prague Conservatory from 1941–1942 and again in 1953. He was on the faculty at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague from 1952–1973. Among his notable pupils were Václav Zítek and Naděžda Kniplová. In 1959 he was made a People's Artist of the USSR.

It was described in 2009 from remains found in 1997 by Yoshinori Kobayashi from the Kuwajima Formation of central Japan, outcropping in Hakusan in the Ishikawa Prefecture. The holotype, SBEI 176, consists of cranial bones from an incomplete, disarticulated skull and left lower jaw thought to belong to a single individual. The type species is named A. yamaguchiorum. The generic name is derived from Latin albus, \\"white\\", and Greek λόϕος (lophos), \\"crest\\", a reference to the snow-covered crest of Mount Hakusan. The specific name honours Ichio Yamaguchi and Mikiko Yamaguchi, who discovered and prepared many fossils from the site. The exact age of the strata from which the remains of Albalophosaurus have been found is not known because of the lack of marine beds containing index fossils, but the Kuwajima Formation is known to have formed during the Early Cretaceous, most likely after the Berriasian and before the Barremian based on the ages of underlying and overlying formations. More recent studies suggest that the age of the Kuwajima Formation is most likely Valanginian—Hauterivian, although the exact age is still uncertain. Phylogeny Although Albalophosaurus was classified as a basal ceratopsian in a phylogenetic analysis conducted along with the description of the genus, only one ambiguous synapomorphy of the clade is present in the holotype, and none of the unambiguous synapomorphies that define Ceratopsia are present. Other characteristics, such as those of the dental morphology of Albalophosaurus, seem to suggest that the genus shares a relation to Ornithopoda. Thus the authors of the original description of the genus refer it to Cerapoda incertae sedis, and do not consider it to be a ceratopsian. Han et al., 2012 found Albalophosaurus to be a ceratopsian more derived than Micropachycephalosaurus, Yinlong, Stenopelix, and Chaoyangosaurus, but basal to a clade composed of Psittacosaurus and more derived ceratopsians.

Sections of the road located in Weathersfield have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Route The Crown Point Road began at the Fort at Number 4, roughly where the center of Charlestown, New Hampshire is located, on the east side of the Connecticut River. It followed a generally northward route, reaching its river crossing point near the mouth of Beaver Brook. On the Vermont side of the river, it proceeded north-northwest through what are now Springfield and Weathersfield before bearing west across Cavendish. Roughly at the center of Cavendish, it again turned more north, turning west again between Plymouth and Ludlow toward Shrewsbury. It reached Otter Creek in Clarendon, and then followed that valley northward, through Rutland, Proctor, and Pittsford, before bearing northwest across the hills south of Brandon. Near the junction of Vermont Routes 30 and 73 in northern Sudbury, a spur of the road headed west toward Fort Ticonderoga (passing through present-day Orwell), while the main road continued northwest through Whiting, Shoreham, and Bridport before finally reaching Lake Champlain opposite Fort Crown Point in present-day Addison. History In 1759, British forces under the command of General Jeffery Amherst captured Fort Ticonderoga from the French in the later stages of the French and Indian War. Determined to maintain British control over the southern end of Lake Champlain, Amherst ordered the construction of Fort Crown Point, and the construction of the road joining it to the Fort at Number 4, then the northernmost British colonial outpost on the Connecticut River. The route roughly followed an old Native American trail, parallelling the Black River in its southern extent and Otter Creek in its northern. Early work on the road was performed by colonial militia forces commanded by Colonel John Stark. Work included the clearing of trees and stumps, construction of bridges across small streams, and the construction of corduroy sections across swampy terrain. After the war, the road became a major route by which central southern Vermont was settled. As more and better roads were built through the region, portions fell into disuse and were abandoned, while others continued to be used and were improved. In the late 19th century, efforts were made to mark and commemorate the route, resulting in the placement of markers, some of which are still present along or near its route. In some communities, portions of the original route are named \\"Crown Point Road\\" or \\"Old Crown Point Road\\". A portion of the route, some of it still in little-altered condition, is found in the area of Stoughton Pond in northern Springfield. This and other nearby portions in Springfield and Weathersfield were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. with File:Weathersfield-Vermont-Historic-Crown-Point-Road-VT19.jpg|Crown Point Road (now Branch Brook Road) near Weathersfield, Vermont File:Weathersfield-Vermont-Historic-Crown-Point-Road-VT20.jpg|Crown Point Road (now Branch Brook Road) near Weathersfield, Vermont See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Windsor County, Vermont  References  External links * Chimney Point State Historic Site * The Crown Point Road Association Category:Roads in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Windsor County, Vermont Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont ","title":"Crown Point Road"},{"id":"24355979","text":"Battletruck (also known as Warlords of the 21st Century in the U.S. and Destructors in Italy) is a 1982 New Zealand post-apocalyptic science fiction action film co-written and directed by Harley Cokliss and starring Michael Beck, Annie McEnroe, James Wainwright, John Ratzenberger, and Bruno Lawrence. Set in the aftermath of a devastating series of wars referred to as the Oil Wars, the plot is a futuristic tale of a community fighting against a local warlord in the lawless rural countrywide. A co-production between New Zealand and the United Kingdom, it was filmed on location in New Zealand and starring a number of local actors, and was part of a wave of similarly-themed films made in the wake of the success of the Mad Max series.  Plot  In the near future, Earth has been devastated by a series of wars referred to as the Oil Wars over depleting petroleum reserves. The regions around the Mediterranean Basin are largely radioactive wastes; oil fields in the Middle East burn out of control. Food riots have become common in many cities now under martial law. Much of rural countryside has become lawless with the majority of remaining military and police trying to maintain order in the cities. Large groups of citizens are fleeing cities to the countryside to find food and any remaining fuel reserves. What little petroleum remains in these regions has become a precious commodity fought over by vicious warlords and mercenaries. A war party led by former army colonel Jacob Straker (James Wainwright) intercept two traders with large amount of diesel fuel. The surviving trader takes the war party to the source, which is a hidden supply depot lost during the local government's collapse and thought to be radioactive. Straker orders his men to setup camp to use the supply depot as a base of operations. Straker's daughter Coraline \\"Corlie\\" (Annie McEnroe) refuses to execute the surviving trader. While Straker plans the camp's defense at night, she runs away and flees through the open desert. Corlie is saved from a squad of men sent to return her to the camp by Hunter (Michael Beck), an ex-soldier armed with a high-tech motorbike. Corlie lies about her past and claims she was a hostage taken after her family died. Needing further medical attention for a leg injury, Hunter takes Corlie to live in the walled city of Clearwater Farm, governed as a strict old-fashioned democracy, where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by her father's men who take over the Clearwater community to feed Straker's war party. Corlie steals a horse and manages to escape back to Hunter's remote farm in the woods. The mercenaries terrorize and pillage the community. Straker tortures the resident mechanic Rusty (John Ratzenberger) into giving him the location of Hunter's secret hideout. Straker moves to attack Hunter's farm and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike and Straker, in a rage, plows through Hunter's residence with his truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \\"battletruck\\". While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, one of the residents turns traitor and knocks out Corlie, puts her in a wagon, and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow. Believing that he has killed Hunter, the traitor appears at Straker's headquarters with Corlie in the wagon. Meanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact that he is wounded. He attacks Straker's headquarters, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 liter diesel fuel supply. He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him. In the process, he forces the driver to drive the truck at a higher speed, overheating the turbines. This stresses out the driver (who loves the truck) and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter, meanwhile, gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's headquarters was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The Clearwater people are at the high place waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the film. Hunter fires a couple of rockets at the truck; one causes slight damage and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is uselessly destroying the truck. Straker kills the driver who slumps over the wheel and now the truck, throttle set to full, is more or less out of control. Back on the bike again, Hunter manages to jump onto the truck through a hole in the top that one of his rockets had made. A battle ensues, the truck still careening wildly back and forth while Corlie tries to control it with the body of the driver slumped over the wheel and Straker furiously shouting commands to everyone. Eventually, Hunter fights his way to the front, temporarily stuns Straker, grabs Corlie, and jumps with her from the back of the still-wildly out of control battletruck with Straker still in it and still screaming, making death threats, and bumbling about the smoking ruins of the interior of the truck before it falls off a cliff, crashes and explodes, killing him. Hunter and Corlie end up back at Clearwater, where Corlie apparently settles for good as part of the community. Ever the loner, Hunter rides off into the sunset on a horse, promising Corlie that he will be back \\"sometime\\".

Despite being produced by a Hollywood studio and being considered a Hollywood release, the film largely used a New Zealand crew and New Zealand actors. It followed the success of films such as Mad Max and was made in New Zealand in part due to the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike.

Before the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1930s, the homestead belonged to mountain farmer Jacob Tyson McCarter (1878-1950), a descendant of some of the area's earliest European settlers. While McCarter's house is no longer standing, several outbuildings-- including a barn, springhouse, corn crib, and smokehouse-- have survived, and have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Tyson McCarter Place-- like the Noah Ogle Place a few miles to the west-- was once characteristic of the hundreds of small farms that once dotted the isolated coves and valleys of the northern Smokies. McCarter's house and outbuildings were arranged in an unusual circular formation around an open barnyard, probably to allow the livestock maximum protection from wild animals. Another unique feature of the McCarter outbuildings is the adjoined barn and corn crib (these are usually two separate structures). Two chimney falls and the remnants of a foundation mark where McCarter's house once stood, and several well-built rock walls criss- cross the homestead.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), pp. 274-276. Location The Tyson McCarter Place is situated along Webb Creek, which flows northward from its source high up on the slopes of Greenbrier Pinnacle and empties into the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River at Pittman Center. The Old Settlers Trail crosses the Tyson McCarter Place west of the trail's junction with the Maddron Bald Trail (near the Sevier-Cocke county line). An unmarked gravel maintenance road (usually gated, but open to foot traffic) connects the Tyson McCarter Place to U.S. Route 321, just west of the Rocky Grove community. With the exception of a small clearing containing the barn, corn crib, and smokehouse, and a small clearing containing the house ruins and springhouse, the area is covered in a dense hardwood forest. Historical structures Smokehouse The barn and outbuildings at the Tyson McCarter Place were probably built around 1876 (they were definitely built before 1900) The farm was one of a dozen or so farms that once comprised the Webb Creek community. McCarter's daughter Olive \\"Ollie\\" McCarter (1904-1998) recalled that she, her father, and her sisters built the farm's rock walls, some of which are still standing and run parallel to the Old Settlers Trail for a short distance (rock walls such as these were common in the northern Smokies, where they served the same purpose as barbed-wire fences).Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), p. 21. The McCarters raised hogs, and used the large barn stalls to house mules. The farm's main crops were corn, rye, wheat, and tobacco. Their farm also included a peach orchard and an apple orchard. Springhouse The barn is a one-story double-pen rectangular log \\"drive-through\\" barn with an attached lean-to corn crib. The side walls of the barn are built of saddle-notched unhewn logs, whereas the front and back walls are built with hewn logs. The barn's gabled roof was originally built with hand-split shingles, and the foundation was originally built of loose stones and logs. The two pens are each by , and are separated by an drive-through (wagons were usually parked in the drive- through). The corn crib is built of unhewn saddle-notched logs, and originally included a handmade door secured by a wooden latch. The smokehouse, used for curing meat, is a one-story structure built of hewn, dove-tail notched logs, measuring by . Like the barn, the smokehouse has a gabled roof originally covered with handmade wooden shingles and a foundation of loose stones and logs. The door and storage shelves are missing. The springhouse, used for refrigeration, is a rectangular structure built of hewn chamfer notched logs, measuring by . The earthen floor contains a stone trough through which a spring flowed, which kept perishables cool. Two chimney falls, each approximately tall and apart, indicate the former location of the McCarters' house.

Founded in 2005, it was the first university-based center in North America dedicated to the study of antisemitism. Professor Charles A. Small was the director. In early June 2011, Yale announced the closure of the Initiative by the end of July, sparking protest from the organized American Jewish community. After its closure, Yale announced the opening of the Yale Program for the Study of Antisemitism under the direction of Professor Maurice Samuels. History Professor Charles Small founded the Institute for the Study of Global Anti- Semitism and Policy (ISGAP) in 2005 in New Haven, as an independent research organization to study global antisemitism and other forms of racism. In 2006, the center became part of Yale University as the Yale Initiative for Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism (YIISA). It is part of the university's Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Small explained his motivations to a reporter this way, \\"The world is changing rapidly and I think Anti-Semitism is changing rapidly... As scholars it is our responsibility and job to begin to analyze and understand these processes.\\" At the time, it was the fourth university center for antisemitism to be established, following centers at the Technical University of Berlin, and Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University in Israel. Closure In early June 2011, Yale University notified YIISA that the center would be closed at the end of July. A Yale spokesman stated that the initiative did not meet \\"its academic expectations and has been canceled.\\" Yale's decision sparked widespread criticism from the American Jewish community. David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee, said the Initiative's termination would \\"create a very regrettable void.\\" National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, stated, \\"Especially at a time when anti-Semitism continues to be virulent and anti-Israel parties treat any effort to address issues relating to anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism as illegitimate, Yale’s decision is particularly unfortunate and dismaying.\\" Others alleged that Yale's decision to close YIISA was political in nature, owing to the Initiative's controversial discussion of Muslim antisemitism. Abby Wisse Schachter, a commentator at the New York Post wrote that Yale \\"almost certainly\\" terminated the program because it \\"refused to ignore the most virulent, genocidal and common form of Jew-hatred today: Muslim anti- Semitism.\\" Walter Reich, a member of the board of advisers of YIISA and a former director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum wrote that the closure came on the tails of a \\"firestorm\\" which ensued after YIISA hosted a conference in August 2010 entitled \\"Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity\\", where some of the speakers highlighted instances of antisemitism in the Arab-Muslim world. Conversely, Antony Lerman, a British scholar of antisemitism, welcomed Yale's decision to close YIISA. Lerman argued that the organization was politicized and that its demise should be welcomed by those who \\"genuinely support the principle of the objective, dispassionate study of contemporary antisemitism.\\"Daniel Treiman, \\"Lipstadt on Yale anti-Semitism initiative: Advocacy sometimes trumped scholarship\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 16 June 2011, accessed 16 June 2011. Robert Wistrich, the director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at Hebrew University agreed with the decision to close the center, saying that there was \\"no way that Yale could have come to a different decision\\" given the program's perceived lack of academic rigor. Successor program On June 20, 2011, less than three weeks after Yale said YIISA would be closed, Yale's provost Peter Salovey announced the creation of a new program for the study of antisemitism named the Yale Program for the Study of Antisemitism (YPSA). In the wake of the YIISA decision, Salovey said a group of faculty members expressed interest in creating a new initiative. Professor Maurice Samuels, director of the new institute, said research would be devoted to both contemporary and historical antisemitism, stating, \\"Like many, I am concerned by the recent upsurge in violence against Jews around the world.\\" Charles Small, the former executive director of YIISA expressed skepticism regarding the new program, accusing it of being too historically focused: \\"Anti-Semitism is a 21st-century relevant issue. To focus on its roots and history, glosses over issues scholars must address today, especially when it comes to the threat of contemporary radical Islamist anti-Semitism.\\" References External links * Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism Category:Yale University Category:Centers for the study of antisemitism Category:Research institutes established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism"},{"id":"24356056","text":"Joanne (\\"Jo-Anne\\") Ritchie (born in Kelowna, British Columbia) is a retired triathlete from Canada.

The Center brings together a multidisciplinary group of engineers, computer scientists, meteorologists, sociologists, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as industry and government partners to conduct fundamental research, develop enabling technology, and deploy prototype engineering systems based on a new paradigm: Distributed Collaborative Adaptive Sensing (DCAS) networks.  History  CASA was established in 2003 under the National Science Foundation. Beginning in FY 2010, the main source of funding and support came from the Jerome M. Paros Fund for Measurement and Environmental Sciences Research.  Structure  CASA is a collaboration among four academic partners: the University of Massachusetts Amherst (lead institution), the University of Oklahoma, Colorado State University, and the University of Puerto Rico. Other collaborating academic institutions are: the University of Delaware, the University of Virginia and McGill University.  Achievements  CASA initially operated a network of low-power, short-range, X- band, dual- polarized Doppler weather radars in southwestern Oklahoma. The system, known as Integrative Project 1 or IP1 for short, was installed in January 2006 and began operation April 1 of 2006. IP1 is the first CASA test bed to demonstrate DCAS and the value of low-level sensing, and a number of research opportunities will be made available by the system. Since the construction of IP1, two new testbeds have been built and tested - one in Dallas, and one in Massachusetts.

The Cantu a tenore is a style of polyphonic folk singing characteristic of the Barbagia region of the island, even though some other Sardinian sub-regions bear examples of such tradition. The cantu a tenore was proclaimed by the UNESCO \\"Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage\\" in 2005. Biography The Tenores di Bitti \\"Mialinu Pira\\" have a special place among the many groups in Sardinia. Having a style which is slightly less rough than that of other quartets, exemplary researchers in their heritage, impeccable executors with exceptional vocal quality, adorable people, they have reached a level of excellence and of admiration which is without equal in Sardinia and in the whole world. Their frequent performances on so many national television programs are to be remembered. In the last few years they've been touring extensively Europe (France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, Nederland, Austria, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Swiss, Ireland, Croatia, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Tunisia, Hungary, United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Japan). It is also remarkable their participation in 2001 to the Christmas Concert in the Vatican for the Pope John Paul II, the concert on May 2009 in the Concertgebouw Theater in Amsterdam and in December in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The Tenores di Bitti \\"Mialinu Pira\\", having performed for so many years, is nowadays considered from music-fans and ethno- musicologists the most prominent example of this vocal art. There are many points that make them so special : the cantu a tenore is still well alive in Sardinia performed by many groups, most of them are old singers performing traditional texts. Their young age is a first approach to notice how their sound, harsh and ancestral, is in fact very homogeneous. Their perfect tuning and their powerful sound is very rare today, because this skill needs years of practice and passion to be performed at its best. Another matter to be pointed is their accuracy in choosing lyrics. Both in dancing (lestru, dillu, seriu, passu torrau,) and slow (isterrita, boch'e notte) forms, the lyrics, by famous poets or from misknown contemporary authors, make the repertoire of Tenores di Bitti \\"Mialinu Pira\\" an important vehicle of literary transmission. These songs are profane poems speaking about the shepherds and their solitude in touch with the nature, referring to the popular world and its traditions. The religious' songs are performed in church, in particular, moments of the liturgical year (Christmas, Easter or patronal feasts) or during the religious processions through the street of the village of Bitti. The Grobbes and some lullabies for Baby Jesus (su Nenneddu) belong to this repertoire. Tenores di Bitti \\"Mialinu Pira\\", it's a traditional vocal quartet \\"a cappella\\" from the island of Sardinia, Italy. The \\"a tenore song\\" The Tenores singing (cantu a tenore) is one of the more ancient ways of singing in the Mediterranean area. Nothing about its origins is sure, but the historians maintain that this traditional polyphony goes back to 3000 years ago.... The singing is made a cappella by four male voices (oche, mesu oche, bassu and contra), the main feature of this polyphony is represented by bassu and contra because of their guttural and ancestral sound. The Tenores singing from Bitti, in the centre of Sardinia, is a unique vocal style. It immediately succeeds in sounding primitive and strong. It is no mere coincidence that the experts think that it may have had its origin in primitive times as an imitation of nature: the four voices of which the choir is composed is no more than the lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep and the sound of the wind. These were harmonised and given poetic lyrics of age-old beauty. The guttural use of voices and the typical songs of intonation, cannot be confused with anything else and make this millenary art have great impact. A magic of the human voice. The a Tenore Song was proclaimed by the Unesco \\"Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage\\" in 2005.

This is a list of Royal Northumberland Fusiliers battalions in World War II. At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, a fusilier infantry regiment of the British Army, consisted of seven battalions. A further three were raised during the war. Prior to the war, the regiment was one of a number that been selected to transition from an infantry role to a support role and be equipped with the Vickers machine gun. While most battalions served as divisional machine gun or support battalions, several undertook different roles: motorcycle, searchlight, tank, reconnaissance, regular infantry, and deception units. The regiment saw action with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the Battle of France and Dunkirk, defended the United Kingdom, fought in the North African Campaign, took part in the Battle of Singapore, fought in the Italian Campaign, and operated with the 21st Army Group in the North-West Europe Campaign of 1944–45, operating on the Western Front. Inter-war years In November 1919, following the end of the First World War, the war-raised battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers were disbanded. The single exception was the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion. While its personal were transferred to the Regular Army 1st Battalion on 12 July 1919 disembodied on 29 July, it was not formally disbanded until April 1953. On 7 February 1920, following the establishment of the Territorial Army (T.A.), the 1st Line Territorial Force battalions of the regiment were reconstituted. The battalions were grouped together, to once again form the Northumberland Brigade, which was part of the Northumbrian Division. During the interwar period, the make-up of the regiment was as follows: * 1st Battalion * 2nd Battalion * 3rd Battalion (Militia) suspended animation * 4th Battalion (T.A.) * 5th Battalion (T.A.) * 6th Battalion (T.A.) * 7th Battalion (T.A.) In June 1935, as part of H.M. King George V's silver jubilee, the regiment was accorded royal status in recognition for their service during the First World War. They would henceforth be known as the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers. In 1922, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) was disbanded in order to save money. Following which, Vickers machine guns were organised into Machine Gun Platoons (later, Machine Gun Companies) in each infantry battalion. In 1936, this decision was reversed and the heavy machine guns were, once again, to be concentrated in specialised Divisional (Machine Gun) or Divisional (Support) Battalions. Rather than resurrecting the MGC, a number of infantry regiments were converted to take on the role. The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was one of four regiments selected for conversion. The needs of modern mechanized warfare had a significant effect on the regiment's T.A. battalions. The Northumbrian Division was reorganized as a Motor Division, which saw a reduction from three to two brigades (but the addition of a motorcycle battalion) and the Northumberland Brigade was broken up. On 1 November 1938, the role of several battalions were changed. The 4th Battalion was converted to a motorcycle battalion, and assigned to 50th Division The 5th Battalion became a searchlight battalion, styled as 5th Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (53rd Searchlight Regiment), and assigned to the 30th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. The 6th Battalion was converted to an armoured role and transferred to the Royal Tank Corps as its 43rd Battalion (6th (City) Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers). The 7th Battalion was converted to a machine gun battalion in Northumbrian Area, Northern Command By 1939, it became clear that a new major war was likely to break out. The War Office ordered the doubling of the T.A., with each unit forming a duplicate. The 4th and 7th Battalions formed duplicates: the 8th and 9th Battalions. On the eve of the Second World War, the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers consisted of: * 1st Battalion (MG) * 2nd Battalion (MG) * 4th Battalion (T.A.) (motorcycle) * 5th Battalion (T.A.) (53rd Searchlight Regiment) * 7th Battalion (T.A.) (MG) * 8th Battalion (T.A.) (motorcycle) * 9th Battalion (T.A.) (MG) Second World War 1st Battalion At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 1st Battalion was a machine gun unit assigned to the 18th Infantry Brigade as part of the British Troops in Egypt. It was stationed at Abbassia, Cairo but was just leaving for Mersa Matruh in the Western Desert. By the end of the month, it was attached to the 7th Infantry Division and was still attached when the division was designated as 6th Infantry Division on 3 November 1939; the battalion remained with it until April 1940. From April to December 1940, the battalion was attached to the 4th Indian Infantry Division and served in Operation Compass which saw the Italians expelled from Egypt and the capture of Sidi Barrani. Thereafter, the division departed for East Africa without the battalion. From January 1941, it was assigned to XIII Corps and from August to December 1941 it was in Tobruk Fortress. It then came under the command of the Eighth Army until the end of the North African Campaign. Its most notable action was in the Battle of El Alamein when it operated as separate companies among the units of I Corps: * HQ attached to 8th Armoured Division * W Company attached to 131st Lorried Infantry Brigade, 10th Armoured Division * X Company attached to 2nd Armoured Brigade, 1st Armoured Division * Y Company reforming * Z Company attached to \\"Hammerforce\\", 1st Armoured Division On 19 September 1943, the battalion moved to Syria where it joined the 10th Indian Infantry Division and remained with it for the rest of the war. In March 1944, the battalion transited Palestine and Egypt and shipped to Italy, landing at Taranto on 28 March; it remained on the Italian Front for the rest of the Second World War. The battalion saw action on the Gothic Line and in the 1945 Spring offensive. During the war Captain James Jackman was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. 2nd Battalion At the outbreak of the war, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was stationed in Dover, Kent, and attached as the machine gun unit to the Colchester based 4th Infantry Division. It joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in October 1939 and served there until June 1940. Although organized as a divisional machine gun battalion, it was attached to General Headquarters (GHQ) and was assigned to divisions as required. It joined Home Forces on its return from Dunkirk and on 11 November 1941 it rejoined the 4th Division as its machine gun battalion until 20 May 1942 when it was posted back to Home Forces. On 3 July 1943, it joined the 46th Infantry Division in North Africa as a support battalion. It moved to Italy with the division taking part in the Salerno landings, capture of Naples, Volturno Crossing and Mont Camino. On 10 March 1944, it left the 46th Division and once again joined the 4th Division. It was reconfigured as a machine gun battalion on 7 June 1944 and remained with the division for the rest of the war. It fought at Cassino II, Trasimene Line, Arezzo, Advance to Florence and Rimini Line. In December 1944, it moved with the division to Greece where it remained until the end of the war. 4th Battalion The 4th Battalion was converted to a motorcycle battalion in 1938, and was assigned to the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (then organised as a Motor Division) on the outbreak of the war. It served with the division in France and Belgium from January to June 1940. It took part in the action on the Ypres-Comines Canal. Nord department, France, 20 March 1940. After returning from Dunkirk, the battalion came under command of Home Forces until April 1941; on 30 April 1941 it was transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps and redesignated as 50th Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps, and it rejoined 50th Division. It was then sent to North Africa with the division in June 1941, with a short stay in Cyprus from July to November 1941 and in Iraq from November to December 1941. Much of the time, 50 Recce was attached to the 150th Infantry Brigade in keeping with the then current tactical organisation of brigade groups in the British Army in the Mediterranean and Middle East. From February to June 1942 it was assigned to the 22nd Armoured Brigade. In June 1942, it returned to the United Kingdom and was in the Home Forces once again. On 6 June 1942 it became 50th Regiment, Reconnaissance Corps and in March 1943 reverted to the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as the 4th Battalion. On 25 April 1944, the battalion was suspended; its personnel formed three independent machine gun companies for the British armoured divisions of the 21st Army Group: * 1st Independent Machine Gun Company assigned to the Guards Armoured Division * 2nd Independent Machine Gun Company assigned to the 11th Armoured Division * 3rd Independent Machine Gun Company assigned to the 7th Armoured Division All three served throughout the North-West Europe Campaign. They variously saw action at Odon, Bourguébus Ridge, Mont Pinçon, The Nederrijn, The Rhineland, and The Rhine. 5th Battalion (53rd Searchlight Regiment) Note: Although the 5th Battalion spent most of the war as part of the Royal Artillery, its record is included here for completeness. The 5th Battalion was converted to a searchlight battalion on 1 November 1938 as 5th Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (53rd Searchlight Regiment). At the outbreak of the war, it was assigned to 30th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, 7th Anti- Aircraft Division as part of the anti-aircraft defences for the North East. On 1 August 1940, it was transferred to the Royal Artillery as the 53rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery and transferred to 57th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. It remained as a searchlight regiment in the UK until January 1945. In January 1945, the diminishing threat of the Luftwaffe coupled with a manpower shortage in 21st Army Group, particularly in the infantry, led to the conversion of surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry units. 53rd Searchlight Regiment was one of the regiments selected but it did not revert to its original title, instead becoming 638th (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Regiment, Royal Artillery on 23 January 1945. It joined 304th Infantry Brigade, initially in the UK but in Norway from June 1945. It was placed in suspended animation in Norway on 13 December 1945. 7th Battalion At the outbreak of the war, the 7th Battalion was organized as a machine gun battalion in Northumbrian Area, Northern Command. The battalion joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in October 1939. It was assigned to III Corps and attached to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, which had been stationed at the Maginot Line, and escaped being encircled with the rest of the BEF during the Battle of Dunkirk. It was then pulled back to the west of Northern France, where it was attached to the French Tenth Army. For some time, the 51st was forced to hold a line four times longer than that which would normally be expected of a division. During this period, the 154th Infantry Brigade was detached and withdrawn successfully. However, the 152nd and 153rd Infantry Brigades were trapped at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, and surrendered on 12 June. Men of the 7th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers charge ashore during invasion exercises at Greencastle, County Down in Northern Ireland, 8 May 1942. The battalion was reconstituted in the United Kingdom, and on 12 October 1940 was assigned to 206th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) until 17 December. On 18 November 1941, the battalion was assigned to the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. It remained in the United Kingdom training and preparing for the opening of the Western Front. The battalion landed in Normandy with the division on 27 June 1944, and fought with it in the Battle for Caen and Mont Pinçon. Due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Army, the 59th Division was disbanded on 19 October 1944 and the battalion was placed in suspended animation. 8th Battalion The 8th Battalion was formed as a duplicate of the 4th Battalion on 18 June 1939 (first officer commissioned) organized as a motorcycle battalion. On 2 October 1939 it was assigned to the 23rd (Northumbrian) Division. The division was sent to France on 22 April 1940, on labour and training duties, without any of its artillery or the bulk of its signals and administration units. On 20 May 1940, the division suffered heavy casualties trying to delay the German advance at Arras and had to be evacuated at Dunkirk. On its return to the UK, after Dunkirk, the 23rd Division was disbanded due to the heavy losses it had suffered. After Dunkirk, the battalion left the 23rd Division on 29 June 1940. It was under command of Home Forces until November 1940 when it joined the 3rd Infantry Division, a Regular unit, as a motorcycle battalion. On 30 April 1941 it was transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps and redesignated as 3rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps, on 6 June 1942 as 3rd Regiment, Reconnaissance Corps and finally on 1 January 1944 it was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps as 3rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Reconnaissance Regiment. It remained part of the 3rd Infantry Division until August 1945. The 3rd Infantry Division remained in the UK training for many years until it landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944 – D-Day – and fought through the Battle of Normandy (Caen, Bourguébus Ridge, Mont Pinçon), the Netherlands (The Nederrijn) and later the invasion of Germany the (Rhineland and the Rhine), ending the war in Bremen. It was placed in suspended animation in July 1946. 9th Battalion The 9th Battalion was formed as a duplicate of the 7th Battalion on 27 July 1939 (first officer commissioned). It was organized as a machine gun battalion and on the outbreak of the war was in Northumbrian Area, Northern Command On 2 October 1939 it was attached to the 23rd Northumbrian Division (under command for labour duties and training, though not a Divisional Unit) and proceeded to France with them in April 1940. After Dunkirk, the battalion left the 23rd Division on 29 June as the division was disbanded. It was under command of Lieutenant Colonel Lechmere Thomas as part of Home Forces until January 1942 when it was transferred to Malaya Command, landing at Singapore a few days before the fall of the island . It went into Japanese POW camps after the brief but violent week-long Battle of Singapore. 10th (Home Defence), 1/10th (Home Defence), 30th Battalion The 10th (Home Defence) Battalion was formed in December 1939 by the redesignation of No. 40 Group, National Defence Companies (formed in September 1936). On 25 September 1940, it was split to form 1/10th (Home Defence) Battalion and 2/10th (Home Defence) Battalion. Both battalions were redesignated on 24 November as 10th (Home Defence) Battalion and 11th (Home Defence) Battalion. The 10th Battalion absorbed the 11th Battalion on 23 June 1941. On 24 December 1941, the battalion was converted to normal infantry and redesignated, once again, as 30th Battalion. In August 1943, it moved to North Africa where it joined 42nd Infantry Brigade. The brigade was redesignated 57th Division as a deception, and the 30th Battalion became \\"170th Brigade\\" until 30 April 1944. On 14 May 1944, it was posted to 233rd Brigade on Malta where it remained until the end of the war. It was disbanded on Malta in 1945. 2/10th (Home Defence), 11th (Home Defence) Battalion The 2/10th (Home Defence) Battalion was formed on 25 September 1940 with personnel drawn from the 10th (Home Defence) Battalion. On 24 November, it was redesignated the 11th (Home Defence) Battalion and it was absorbed back into the 10th (Home Defence) Battalion on 23 June 1941. 70th (Young Soldier) Battalion The 70th (Young Soldier) Battalion was formed at Newcastle on 19 September 1940 by withdrawing the Young Soldier companies of the 30th Battalion, the 30th Battalion of the Green Howards, and the 30th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. On 12 November 1942 it was redesignated as No. 98 Primary Training Centre. Post-war The withdrawal from Empire, in particular the independence of India, led to a sharp reduction in the number of battalions in the regular army. In common with all the other regiments of the British Army, the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers were reduced to a single battalion; the 1st Battalion was reduced to cadre at Gibraltar and the 2nd Battalion was renumbered on 1 August 1948 as the 1st Battalion. The battalions of the Territorial Army were reconstituted on 1 January 1947: * 4th Battalion was reconstituted as infantry * 638th Regiment, Royal Artillery was reformed as 588th Light Anti-aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. On 1 September 1950 it was converted to infantry under its original title (5th Battalion) and simultaneously absorbed into the 4th Battalion * 43rd Royal Tank Regiment was reconstituted as an armoured regiment. On 1 November 1956 it converted to infantry with its former title (6th (City) Battalion) * 7th Battalion was reconstituted as infantry and immediately absorbed its war-time duplicate, 9th Battalion * 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment was converted to infantry with its former title (8th Battalion) and immediately disbanded * 9th Battalion was reformed and concurrently absorbed into its parent 7th Battalion See also * 43rd Royal Tank Regiment – 6th Battalion transferred before the outbreak of the war * 49th Royal Tank Regiment – duplicate of 43 RTR * List of Northumberland Fusiliers battalions in World War I Notes References Bibliography      External links  * Category:Royal Northumberland Fusiliers Category:Battalions of the British Army Category:Lists of British Army units and formations Category:Lists of military units and formations of World War II Category:Northumberland-related lists Category:Military units and formations in Northumberland Royal Northumberland Fusiliers battaltions ","title":"List of Royal Northumberland Fusiliers battalions in World War II"},{"id":"24356319","text":"Ben Morrison is an American stand-up comedian, entertainer, TV personality and actor.

Felis lunensis was one of the first modern Felis species, appearing around 2.5 million years ago in the Pliocene. Fossil specimens of F. lunensis have been recovered in Italy and Hungary. Fossil evidence suggests the modern European wildcat Felis silvestris may have evolved from F. lunensis during the Middle Pleistocene. This has resulted in F. lunensis occasionally being considered a subspecies of Felis silvestris.

By 2007 the FDA had cleared several such stimulation devices. In 2013 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned a manufacturer for promoting the device for unapproved uses such as cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury.  Use   Delayed- and non-union fractures  nonunion of the fracture fragments. While PEMF therapy is claimed to offer some benefits in the treatment of fractures, the evidence is inconclusive and is insufficient to inform current clinical practice.  History  Prior to the year 2000, in parallel with the PEMF research being done in Western Europe, the United States, and Japan, a great deal of scientific work was being done in scientific isolation behind the Iron Curtain, as summarized in a detailed technical report , showing scientific evidence for promising benefits from the use of PEMF for a very wide range of applications including peripheral vascular disease, lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease, rheumatic disease, pediatrics, dermatology, surgery, gynecology, oral medicine, otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, immunity, inflammation, reproduction, and tumors, based on over 200 referenced scientific papers involving both human and animal studies. Veterinarians were the first health professionals to use PEMF therapy, usually to attempt to heal broken legs in racehorses. In 2004, a pulsed electromagnetic field system was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to cervical fusion surgery in patients at high risk for non-fusion. On 13 October 2015 the FDA reclassified PEMF wellness devices from the Class 3 category to a Class 2 status. PEMF devices that have been FDA cleared are able to make health claims that require a doctor's prescription for use. Although claims that electricity might aid bone healing was reported as early as 1841, it was not until the mid-1950s that scientists seriously studied the subject. During the 1970s, Bassett and his team introduced a new approach which attempted to treat delayed fractures; a technique that employed a very specific biphasic low frequency signal to be applied for non-union/delayed fractures. The use of electrical stimulation in the lumbosacral region was first attempted by Alan Dwyer of Australia.  Wellness devices  The original PEMF devices consisted of a Helmholtz coil which generated a magnetic field. The patient's body was placed inside the magnetic field to deliver treatment. Today, the majority of PEMF wellness devices resemble a typical yoga mat in dimensions but are slightly thicker to house several flat spiral coils to produce an even electromagnetic field. A frequency generator is then used to energize the coils to create a pulsed electromagnetic field. A wide variety of professional and consumer PEMF devices are sold and marketed as FDA registered wellness devices. The majority are manufactured in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and are imported into North America as electric massagers or full body electric yoga mats. They are either placed on a massage table for clinical use or directly on the floor in the home to practice simple yoga postures. The companies that sell and manufacture them as \\"general wellness products\\" are not permitted to make medical claims of effectiveness in treating disease.

Thompson (December 25, 1887 – October 18, 1960) was a justice of the Supreme Court of Illinois and a criminal lawyer. He is perhaps best known for representing American businessman Samuel Insull, who in 1934 faced mail fraud and antitrust charges. Insull's verdict was not guilty. Biography Thompson, the son of Alonzo and Sarah (Edwards) Thompson, was born Christmas Day in 1887 on a poor farm in Roodhouse, Illinois. Thompson worked on the family farm while he was in school; after graduation, he spent three years working as a teacher. Thompson never attended university or law school, but he studied for the bar examination on his own, and in 1911, he was admitted to the bar of Tennessee and Illinois. He established a law practice in East Moline, Illinois, and also became publisher of the East Moline Herald. In November 1912, he won election as State's attorney for Rock Island County, Illinois. He was elected president of the Illinois State's Attorney's Association in December 1915, and easily won re-election as State's Attorney in November 1916. In 1919, a vacancy arose on the Supreme Court of Illinois when Justice George A. Cooke stepped down to become chief counsel of Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company, and Thompson ran for this seat, winning election in April 1919. In June 1921, he won re-election to a full term. Thompson served on the Illinois Supreme Court until 1928, during which time he served as chairman of the American Bar Association's Section of Criminal Law (1921–1923) and as vice-president of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology. He was a charter member of the American Law Institute upon its founding in 1923. In 1928, Thompson resigned from the Illinois Supreme Court to run for Governor of Illinois on the Democratic ticket. He lost to Louis Lincoln Emmerson as part of the landslide 1928 victory of Herbert Hoover and the Republicans. Upon his defeat, Thompson became a partner at Newman, Poppenhusen, Stern & Johnston, with the firm changing its name to Johnston, Thompson, & Raymond (today, the firm is known as Jenner & Block). During his time at the firm, Thompson served as lead counsel in what was arguably the most sensational prosecution of the Great Depression era, that of Samuel Insull, the president of Commonwealth Edison, whose share price had collapsed in 1929, wiping out the life savings of thousands of small investors. Insull was charged with mail fraud, antitrust violations, and violation of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. There were ultimately three trials, and Insull was acquitted each time. He was president of the Illinois State Bar Association 1933–34. In 1949, during the prosecution of Preston Tucker (developer of the 1948 Tucker Sedan) and six Tucker Corporation executives for violating the securities laws, Thompson defended Floyd Cerf, the stockbroker who handled the allegedly illegal stock offering for Tucker Corporation. Tucker, Cerf, and all the other defendants were ultimately acquitted on all charges.

In 1825 Maria married the future Decembrist Major General Prince Sergey Grigorievich Volkonsky. When Volkonsky was arrested and exiled to Siberia, she followed him into exile on the condition that her children born after her departure to Siberia would be forever struck from the noble estate and become bonded laborers (); the threat, however, was not put into practice. Life Volkonskaya had a sister Sophia. At the age of eighteen Mariya married Prince Sergey Volkonsky, who was older. Popularly known in Irkutsk as the Princess of Siberia, she founded a local hospital and opened a concert hall, in addition to hosting musical and cultural soirees in her home. In Irkutsk Mariya had a blue and white timber mansion. The Volkonskys had four children; two died at early age. The eldest one, Nikolay (2 January 1826 – 17 January 1828) was born before the exile and died in St Petersburg after his mother's departure for Siberia. The second child named Sophia died on her birth day (1 July 1830), while Mikhail (1832–1909) and Yelena Princess Kotchoubey-Rakhmanoff (1835–1916) survived into the 20th century. A number of literary works, including Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin and Nikolay Nekrasov's poem Russian Women were dedicated to Volkonskaya. A passage in Eugene Onegin reads: :I recall some storm-brewing ocean: :Jealous, I watched its waves that beat :A path straight toward her in devotion, :To swirl in sequence at her feet. :To join those waves my soul was burning, :To touch those limbs with lips so yearning.Eugene Onegin, translated by DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER New York Times In 1922, it was proved that Volkonskaya was the subject of six poems by Pushkin (written in 1820, 1822, 1824, 1825, 1828 and 1829).Б.

Earned him much, for your teacher training, research and educational observations made during this period in the city of Iberville, located in the Montérégie region of Quebec, Canada, and the United States. Applying intensely studies, he graduated from the Institute of Scientific Study, University of New York. Moving back to France in 1914 and, years later, returns to teaching at the College of Notre Dame of Valbenoîte in Saint-Étienne. In 1925 it was published Historie de la Pédagogie, prize-winning work by the French Academy in the following year. Followed by Psychologie appliquée à l'Éducation, Conseils sur le Travail intellectuel, La Discipline Préventive et ses Éléments Essentiels and Méthodologie Générale. As a posthumous work, it was published L'Eglise et l'Éducation de l'Ère Chrétienne au XIV Siècle.

Remington and Sons The Sholes and Glidden typewriter (also known as the Remington No. 1) was the first commercially successful typewriter. Principally designed by the American inventor Christopher Latham Sholes, it was developed with the assistance of fellow printer Samuel W. Soule and amateur mechanic Carlos S. Glidden. Work began in 1867, but Soule left the enterprise shortly thereafter, replaced by James Densmore, who provided financial backing and the driving force behind the machine's continued development. After several short-lived attempts to manufacture the device, the machine was acquired by E. Remington and Sons in early 1873. An arms manufacturer seeking to diversify, Remington further refined the typewriter before finally placing it on the market on July 1, 1874. During its development, this typewriter evolved from a crude curiosity into a practical device, the basic form of which became the industry standard. The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design, including a cylindrical platen and a four-rowed QWERTY keyboard. Several design deficiencies remained, however. The Sholes and Glidden could print only upper-case letters—an issue remedied in its successor, the Remington No. 2—and was a \\"blind writer\\", meaning the typist could not see what was being written as it was entered. Initially, the typewriter received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, and the need for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all- upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices. History Early development The machine patented on June 23, 1868, resembled \\"a cross between a piano and a kitchen table\\".Current 1949, p. 394 The Sholes and Glidden typewriter had its origin in a printing machine designed in 1866 by Christopher Latham Sholes to assist in printing page numbers in books, and serial numbers on tickets and other items.Oden 1917, p. 19 Sholes, a Wisconsin printer, formed a partnership with Samuel W. Soule, also a printer, and together they began development work in Charles F. Kleinsteuber's machine shop, a converted mill in northern Milwaukee. Carlos S. Glidden, an inventor who frequented the machine shop, became interested in the device and suggested that it might be adapted to print alphabetical characters as well.Bliven 1954, p. 44 In July 1867, Glidden read an article in Scientific American describing \\"the Pterotype\\", a writing machine invented by John Jonathon Pratt and recently featured in an issue of London Engineering. Glidden showed the article to Sholes, who thought the machine \\"complicated and liable to get out of order\\",Iles 1912, p. 321 and was convinced that a better machine could be designed. To that point, several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in the United States and abroad.Cortada 2000, p. 15 None of the machines, however, had been successful or effective products.Campbell-Kelly 2004, p. 24 In November 1866, following their successful collaboration on the numbering machine, Sholes asked Soule to join him and Glidden in developing the new device. Mathias Schwalbach, a German clockmaker, was hired to assist with construction. To test the proposed machine's feasibility, a key was taken from a telegraph machine and modified to print the letter \\"W\\"; by September 1867, a model with a full alphabet, numbers, and rudimentary punctuation had been completed, and it was used to compose letters to acquaintances in the hope of selling the invention, or procuring funds for its manufacture.Current 1977, p. 98 One recipient, James Densmore, immediately bought a 25% interest for $600, the cost of the machine's development to that date.Bliven 1954, p. 48Beeching 1974, p. 29 Densmore saw the machine for the first time in March 1868, and was unimpressed; he thought it clumsy and impractical, and declared it \\"good for nothing except to show that its underlying principles were sound\\".Iles 1912, p. 328 Among other deficiencies, the device held paper in a horizontal frame, which limited the thickness of the paper that could be used and made alignment difficult.Iles 1912, p. 324 A patent for the \\"Type-Writer\\" was granted on June 23, 1868, and, despite the device's flaws, Densmore rented a building in Chicago in which to begin its manufacture. Fifteen units were produced before a lack of funds forced the venture back to Milwaukee.Bliven 1954, p. 80 Refinement During 1869, an improved model was designed which, unlike the previous version, drew upon work done by other inventors. A machine patented in 1833 by Charles Thurber, for example, used a cylindrical platen.Current 1949, p. 397 Sholes adapted the idea and implemented a rotating drum to which the paper was clipped, replacing the frame of the previous model.Current 1977, p. 99 Soule and Glidden did not assist development of the new platen and, as their interest in the venture was waning, sold their rights to the original machine to Sholes and Densmore.Current 1949, p. 398 Prototypes were sent to professionals in various fields, including James O. Clephane, a stenographer whose heavy use destroyed several machines. Clephane's feedback, although \\"caustic\\", led to the development of an additional 25 to 30 prototypes, each an improvement on its predecessor. In summer 1870, Densmore traveled to New York to demonstrate the machine to Western Union,Bliven 1954, p. 52Beeching 1974, p. 30 which was looking for a method to record telegrams. Western Union ordered several machines, but declined to purchase the rights, as it believed a superior device could be developed for less than Densmore's asking price of $50,000. E. Remington and Sons' factory in Ilion, New York, c 1874 To supply the orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to manufacture the machine in summer 1871. During this time, the machine was revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production.Current 1949, p. 400 In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever- increasing ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000.Melville 1923, p. 42 Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent.Current 1949, p.402 Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer with whom he had been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons.Current 1977, p. 101 Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.Mayo 2007, p. 29 Start of an industry A redesign incorporated floral ornamentation, a characteristic from Remington's sewing machine division. Following a demonstration at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March 1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000 machines, with the option to produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed to serve as the exclusive sales agent.Current 1949, p. 404 Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re- engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July 1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return.Burlingame 1976, p. 135 The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing,Bliven 1954, p. 82 and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.Bliven 1954, p. 58 By December 1874, only 400 typewriters had been sold, due in part to their high price and poor reliability.Utterback 1999, p. 7 As businesses were slow to adopt the machine, authors, clergymen, lawyers and newspaper editors were the targeted customers.Campbell-Kelly 2004, pp. 25–26 Individuals, however, generally did not write enough to justify the machine's price of about $125, the average annual income per person at the time.Cortada 2000, p. 17Krystal 2007, p. 14 There were exceptions, however; Mark Twain was among the first to purchase the machine, which he termed a \\"curiosity breeding little joker\\". Although the machine was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, it was overshadowed by Alexander Graham Bell's telephone.Bliven 1954, p. 64 Several design and manufacturing improvements followed—including replacing the treadle with a hand lever—and 4,000 machines had been sold by 1877. In 1878, Remington outsourced marketing to E. & T. Fairbanks & Company, a scale manufacturer, as marketing to that point had produced only lackluster sales.Cortada 2000, p. 16 An improved model, the Remington No. 2, was also introduced in 1878. The new machine was able to type upper and lowercase characters, thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor. As the only typewriter manufacturer, Remington maintained a monopoly position until the American Writing Machine Company introduced a typewriter to compete with the Remington machines in 1881.Campbell-Kelly 2004, p.26 In response to the new competition, Remington lowered the price of the Sholes and Glidden (referred to in sales literature as the Remington No. 1) to $80, and negotiated an agreement with the marketing firm Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict to take all the machines produced. The arrangement marked the beginning of the typewriter's commercial success,Ingham 1983, p. 1270 as the agency's marketing prowess led to the sale of 1,200 machines in its first year. By 1884, more competitors had appeared, including the Hammond Typewriter Company, the Crandall Type-Writer Company and the Hall Typewriter Company; in the decade since the introduction of the Sholes and Glidden, a \\"thriving typewriter industry\\" had developed. Design One variant of the Sholes and Glidden typewriter used wires and levers to connect the keys and typebars. The Sholes and Glidden typewriter incorporated several components adapted from existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers adapted from the piano.Utterback 1999, p. 4 In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs which could have been avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30 years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833. In the machine's original 1868 design, paper was placed horizontally on the top of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly \\"kicked\\" the typebars upwards.Current 1949, p. 396 By the end of 1872, the typewriter had taken an appearance similar to that of a modern typewriter. The arm and frame components were replaced with a cylindrical platen in 1869. Unlike modern typewriters, the revised machine entered letters around the cylinder, with axial rotation providing letter spacing and horizontal shifting providing line spacing. Paper was clipped directly to the cylinder, which limited its length and width to the dimensions of the apparatus. The platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow the use of paper of any length. The redesigned platen also introduced the modern spacing functionality (horizontal and axial movement providing letter and line spacing, respectively).Current 1949, p. 401 The cylindrical platen became \\"an indispensable part of every standard [typewriter]\\". By the end of 1872, the appearance and function of the typewriter had assumed the form that would become standard in the industry and remain largely unchanged for the next century. Although the machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a QWERTY keyboard, two design elements that would later become essential were lacking: the ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and \\"visible\\" print. Although the former was implemented in the Remington No. 2, the machine was fundamentally an \\"upstrike\\" design, meaning the typebars struck upwards against the underside of the platen. As this occurred inside the machine, the operator could not see what was being entered as it was typed. Although competing brands, such as the Oliver and Underwood, began to market \\"visible\\" typewriters in the 1890s, a Remington-branded model did not appear until the Remington No. 10 in 1906.Post 1981, p. 85 QWERTY keyboard The QWERTY keyboard, so named for the first six characters of the uppermost alphabetic row, was invented during the course of the typewriter's development. The first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows: { |} Typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring such that they would strike a common center. Schwalbach later replaced the piano-like keys with \\"buttons\\" and positioned them into four banked rows.Current 1954, p. 44 The mechanics of the machine, however, made the alphabetical arrangement problematic. The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring, forming a \\"basket\\". When a key was pressed, the corresponding typebar would swing upwards, causing the print head to strike at the center of the ring. Gravity would then return the typebar to its initial position. The implication of this design, however, was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine. To mitigate this problem, keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error.Utterback 1999, p. 5 Densmore asked his son-in-law, a Pennsylvania school superintendent, what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language.Lekberg 1972, p.37 Typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs, such as S and T, were placed on opposite sides on the ring.Campbell-Kelly 2004, p. 25 The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows: { |} After it purchased the device, Remington made several adjustments—including switching the period and \\"R\\" keys—which created a keyboard with what is essentially the modern QWERTY layout.Pool 1997, p. 159 Reception and legacy Shorthand, although capable of being written quickly, required special training to comprehend. The typewriter simultaneously addressed the need for speed and legibility. The Sholes and Glidden was the first commercially successful typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased the speed with which business was conducted.MacKenzie 2007, pp. 6–7 The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.Campbell- Kelly 2005, §Prehistory The public was initially skeptical of the typewriter, and reactions included apathy and antagonism. Outside of large companies, letters generally did not need to be composed quickly; as the device was reliant upon its operator, it offered no automation. In business settings involving customer interaction, the unfamiliar machines were viewed with suspicion (as there existed the perception that mechanical devices could be rigged by unscrupulous merchants) and the presence of such a large object between the customer and employee \\"interrupted the 'personal touch. Individuals receiving typewritten letters often found them insulting (as type implied they could not read handwriting) or impersonal, problems exacerbated by the all upper-case writing.Burlingame 1976, p. 136Cortada 2000, p. 18 The typewriter also precipitated privacy concerns, as recipients of letters of a personal nature believed a third-party operator or typesetter must have been involved in their composition.Bliven 1954, p. 71 Women and the typewriter A female typist operates a Sholes and Glidden typewriter, as depicted in an 1872 Scientific American article. The association of women with the typewriter may be linked to the way in which it was marketed.Hoke 1979, p. 82 Before the typewriter was acquired by Remington, Sholes' daughter was employed to demonstrate the device and to appear in promotional images, which served as the basis for early advertisements.Wosk 2001, p. 24 Remington's sales agents later marketed the machine with tactics including the use of attractive women to demonstrate the device at trade shows and in hotel lobbies.Miller 1997, p. 349 Depictions of female operators suggested the device was \\"easy enough for a woman\\" and suited for domestic use. Although also designed to allow Remington to maintain manufacturing efficiencies with its sewing machine division, the typewriter's aesthetics (the sewing machine stand and floral ornamentation) were further intended to facilitate its acceptance into the household. A \\"major consequence\\"Utterback 1999, p. 8 of the typewriter's development was the entrance of women into the clerical work force.Beeching 1974, pp. 34–35 Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings.Burlingame 1976, p. 137 Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881,Bliven 1954, p. 72 women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work.Hoke 1979, p. 79 In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%.Krystal 2007, p. 15 Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, \\"I do feel that I have done something for the women who have always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living.\\" See also * American Typewriter, a modern font based on the Sholes and Glidden typewriter font * Dvorak, an alternative to the QWERTY keyboard layout Notes References Bibliography * Beeching, Wilfred A.

It may have an important role in calcium homeostasis. Studies in rats indicate that this protein may also play a role in aging, as it shows age-associated down- regulation. This gene is part of a gene cluster on chromosome Xp11.3-Xp11.23. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants having different 5' UTRs, but encoding the same protein. Regucalcin is a proposed name for a calcium-binding protein that was discovered in 1978 This protein is also known as Senescence Marker Protein-30 (SMP30). Regucalcin differs from calmodulin and other Ca2+-related proteins as it does not contain an EF-hand motif of Ca2+-binding domain. It may regulate the effect of Ca2+ on liver cell functions. From many investigations, regucalcin has been shown to play a multifunctional role in many cell types as a regulatory protein in the intracellular signaling system.  Gene  Regucalcin and its gene (rgn) are identified in 16 species consisting of regucalcin family. Regucalcin is greatly expressed in the liver of rats, although the protein is found in small amounts in other tissues and cells. The rat regucalcin gene consists of seven exons and six introns, and several consensus regulatory elements exist upstream of the 5’-flanking region. The gene is localized on the proximal end of rat chromosome Xq11.1-12 and human Xp11.3-Xp11.23. AP-1, NFI-A1, RGPR-p117, and Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4 can bind to the promoter region of the rat regucalcin gene to mediate the Ca2+ and other signaling responses with various hormones and cytokines for transcriptional activation.  Function  Regucalcin plays a pivotal role in the keep of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis due to activating Ca2+ pump enzymes in the plasma membrane (basolateral membrane), microsomes (endoplasmic reticulum) and mitochondria of many cells. Regucalcin is localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, microsomes and nucleus. Regucalcin is translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus with hormone stimulation. Regucalcin has a suppressive effect on calcium signaling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the proliferative cells. Also, regucalcin has been demonstrated to transport into the nucleus of cells, and it can inhibit nuclear protein kinase, protein phosphatase, and deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis. Regucalcin can control enhancement of cell proliferation due to hormonal stimulation. Moreover, regucalcin has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase, a rate limiting enzyme at translational process of protein synthesis and an activatory effect on cystein protease and superoxide dismutase in liver and kidney cells. Regucalcin is expressed in the neuron of brain tissues, and the decrease of brain regucalcin causes accumulation of calcium in the brain microsomes. Regucalcin has an inhibitory effect on protein kinase and protein phosphatase activity dependent on Ca signaling. Regucalcin has been shown to have an activatory effect on Ca pumping enzyme (Ca-ATPase) in heart sarcoplasmic reticulum. Regucalcin plays a role in the promotion of urinary calcium transport in the epithelial cells of kidney cortex. Overexpression of regucalcin suppresses cell death and apoptosis in the cloned rat hepatoma cells and normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK52E) induced by various signaling factors. Thus, regucalcin plays a multifunctional role in the regulation of cell functions in liver, kidney cortex, heart and brain. Thus, regucalcin plays a pivotal role in keep of cell homeostasis and function. Regucalcin plays a pivotal role as a suppressor protein for cell signaling systems in many cell types.  Pathophysiologic role  Overexpressing of regucalcin in rats (transgenic rats) has been shown to induce bone loss and hyperlipidemia with increasing age, indicating a pathophysiologic role. Regucalcin transgenic rat may be a useful tool as animal model in osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia. Also, regucalcin/SMP30-knockout mice are known to induce a suppression in ascorbic acid biosynthesis. The disorder of regucalcin expression has been proposed to be induced cancer, brain function, heart injury, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and hyperlipidemia.. Regucalcin plays a novel role as a suppressor in carcinogenesis of human patients with various types of cancer including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, and lung cancer. Of note, it has been conducted a systematic search to identify biomarker candidates for a frailty biomarker panel. Gene expression databases were to identify genes regulated in aging, longevity, and age-related diseases with a focus on secreted factors or molecules detectable in body fluids as potential frailty biomarkers. A total of 44 markers were evaluated in the seven categories listed above, and 19 were awarded a high priority score, 22 identified as medium priority and three were low priority. In each category high and medium priority markers were identified. Regucalcin (RGN) was proposed to be a core gene (protein) with high priority of frailty biomarkers in order to ascertain their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.. Notably, it has been shown that epigenetic modifications of survivin and regucalcin in non-small cell lung cancer tissues contribute to malignancy.

Along with Joaquim Tenreiro and José Zanine Caldas, Rodrigues was the pioneer to transform the Brazilian design in industrial design and make it known worldwide. He began his work in the field of architecture in the project of the civic center along with the also architects David Azambuja, Flávio Régis do Nascimento e Olavo redig de Campos. Had the peak of his career in the 50s and 60s. Worked with furniture design according with the modernism, bringing the Brazilian identity to his projects, both in the design and traditional materials – leather, wood and rattan – exalting the Brazilian and native culture. “In fact, in this moment he did coexist the Brazilian-Brazil with the Girl-from-Ipanema, sang later (1962) by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes in the famous \\"Girl from Ipanema\\"” (Oscar Niemeyer). Contemporary of Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, his furniture was utilized in large scale in the construction of Brazil's capital Brasília. “In that time (begin of Brasília) we didn't have time to think about designing any furniture. We used the furniture from the market, selecting as the Palace wanted. The main designer to whom we selected was Sergio Rodrigues” (Lúcio Costa).

He served as the 17th governor of California from September 12, 1887 until January 8, 1891. Early years Waterman was born on December 15, 1826 in Fairfield, New York. He was born to John Dean Waterman and Mary Graves Waldo. His middle name derives from the second wife (Clarissa (Dwight) Whitney) of his maternal grandfather. He had seven siblings, including James Sears Waterman, John Calvin Waterman, Henry Franklin Waterman, Charlotte Judith Waterman, Mary Waterman, Charles Waterman, Caroline Waldo Waterman, and Theodore Francis Waterman. Illinois Waterman moved to Newbury, Illinois when he was thirteen to join his brother as a clerk. Until 1850, he was a store clerk and postmaster in Geneva, Illinois. In 1850, he sold his assets and headed to California. He traveled with F.A. Park, and befriended Brigham Young in Salt Lake City along the way. When he arrived in California, he joined one of his brothers prospecting near the South Fork of the Feather River on Oregon Creek. In 1851, Waterman returned to his family in Wilmington, Illinois and became a successful grain dealer. He returned to Illinois, and helped form the Illinois Republican party in 1854 and published the Willmington Independent newspaper. In 1856, he was one of two Illinois delegates to the first Republican National Convention in Bloomington, Illinois. The other was Abraham Lincoln. In 1860 he played a key role in delivering Illinois to Abraham Lincoln. Return to California In 1873, Waterman returned to California and became a machinery salesman in Redwood City, California. In 1874, he moved to San Bernardino, California. He operated the Stonewall Jackson Mine which netted him $500 a day. In 1880, while residing in San Bernardino, Waterman discovered a silver mine with John Porter a few miles north of Barstow, California, then called Grapevine. In 1881, he formed a mining partnership with John Porter called Waterman and Porter, with 3/4 of the interest owned by Waterman. A stamp mill settlement about four miles (6 km) away was named Waterman. The Southern Pacific Railroad came through Waterman in 1882 and 100 men were employed at the mill and mine. The mine produced 40,000 tons of ore worth US$1.7 million before it closed in 1887 after silver prices declined. In 1886, he purchased Rancho Cuyamaca, including California's Stonewall gold mine. On the Cuyamaca Ranch, he raised cattle and helped build the San Diego, Cuyamaca, and Eastern Railroad. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1886 as a Republican, and he became governor in 1887 upon the death of Governor Washington Bartlett. The 1886 election was the first split between the two posts in California's history. As governor, the \\"Waterman Rifles\\" militia was authorized for San Bernardino, California, named in his honor since he was a resident of the City prior to election. In 1889, possibly at Waterman's urging, the Harlem tract in Patton, California was chosen for the first Southern California Insane Asylum. It opened in 1893 and would become Patton State Hospital in the Highland area of San Bernardino. He served on the U.C. Regents as an ex officio member as both lieutenant governor and governor. His administration suffered from his lack of elected office and poor advisory support. He strongly supported the Congressional Resolution creating Yosemite National Park. The question whether to divide California was a major issue in his term. His nickname was \\"Old Honesty\\", he would not tolerate drunkenness, overspending, nor dishonesty, and vowed to run the state as a business. He chastised the Legislature for having 228 clerks when only 35 were authorized. Though he served out the remainder of the term, his poor health caused him not to seek re-election. He moved to San Diego, where he is buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery. In 1891, he purchased for US$17,000 a Queen Anne- style house built in 1889 known as the Long-Waterman Mansion, now located at 2408 First Avenue, San Diego, 92101. Family life Waterman married Jane Gardner (November 8, 1829 in Stanstead, Quebec – April 12, 1914 in Barstow, California) on September 29, 1847, in Belvedere, Illinois. His children were: * Frank G. Waterman (Born September 12, 1848 in Belvidere, Illinois, died on August 20, 1853) * Waldo Sprague Waterman (born February 1, 1860 in Wilmington, Illinois), married Hazel Emma Wood in Erie Villa, California on April 11, 1889, died February 23, 1903 in San Diego, California) * James Sears Waterman, (born August 22, 1853 in Wilmington, Illinois, died January 19, 1930), married Sarah C. Brown on December 15, 1902) * Mary Pamela Waterman- Rice (born April 9, 1850 in Belvidere, Illinois, died November 3, 1925), married to Hyland W. Rice, San Bernardino County's Public Administrator) * Helen Jane Waterman (born December 18, 1856 in Wilmington, Illinois, died October 14, 1945, Berkeley, California) * Anna Charlotte Waterman (b. April 2, 1866 In Wilmington, Illinois) married Irving M. Scott in San Diego, CA, Sept. 29, 1891 * Abby Lou Waterman (b. February 21, 1869 in Wilmington, Illinois, died April, 1941) Legacy After his death, on April 12, 1891, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Waterman v. Alden reported at 143 U.S. 196. That case involved the will of his brother, James S. Waterman of Sycamore Illinois, who died on July 19, 1883 without children or descendants. On May 14, 1881, Waterman gave his brother an agreement in writing to give his brother within 12 months on demand 24/100th of mining property in California. Waterman testified that the value was $1,000,000 at the time. James Waterman advanced $25,000 to $30,000 to the Waterman Porter partnership, part of which was repaid before James' death. James also held five promissary notes dated in late 1881, for $10,000, payable from February to March 1882 at 8 percent per annum interest. The notes were transferred by Robert Waterman to Philander M. Alden and George S. Robinson, citizens of Illinois and executors of James' estate. The Court ruled that the will did not include the notes. Today, Waterman Avenue, Waterman Gardens, and Waterman Canyon are still named for him in San Bernardino, California, as well as Waterman Road at the western margin of Barstow, south of State Route 58 and north of the Mojave River. Waterman's papers and photographs are in The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley and the San Diego Historical Society.

Located at the intersection of U.S. Route 60 and State Route 30, Anderson's Corner was the western terminus of State Route 168 a new four-laned highway also known as the Merrimack Trail which was established in the pre-World War II era to supplement the heavily traveled Route 60 through the Williamsburg where the Colonial Williamsburg Restoration funded by Abby and John D. Rockefeller Jr.. had added to traffic, as well as the growing Virginia Peninsula area, connecting via harbor ferry with similarly designated roads in South Hampton Roads. On the south side of the harbor, Route 168 connected with North Carolina's own Route 168 leading to the Outer Banks resorts. The newly completed two-laned Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was designated Route 168 when it opened in 1957. The new Tidewater Drive received the Route 168 designation after World War II. As portions of Interstate 64 were completed in the late 1950s and 1960s, they occasionally bore a Route 168 designation for a period of time until substantial through service using the I-64 signage became more practical for use. The route 168 designation was eventually truncated south of the bridge-tunnel, and portions of the former roadway became reused as frontage routes, as well as parts of state routes 30 and State Route 143).

The terms top, bottom, and switch are used to describe roles for the duration of a sometimes- sexual act, or may be used more broadly as a psychological, social, and sexual identity, as well as indicating one's usual preference. The terms top, bottom, and switch are also used in BDSM, with slightly different meanings. In both contexts, the terms top and bottom refer to dominant or submissive, or active and passive roles, not to who is physically on top in a particular sexual act. The older term \\"versatile\\" is sometimes used instead of \\"switch\\". There is considerable controversy about the prevalence of tops and bottoms among male/female and straight/gay populations. Beginning in the 1970s, in some American contexts, people would identify their interests by wearing a set of keys on the side of their belt or a color-coded handkerchief in their rear pockets. This practice, called flagging, began in the gay male subculture. Top In BDSM, top can mean either a dominant partner (see below) in BDSM play (such as flogging, binding, being master, humiliating, and sexual play), or a partner who applies stimulation to another, and who may or may not be dominant. Topping from the bottom is a related BDSM term, meaning a person simultaneously adopts the role of bottom and dom. A service top is a person who applies sensation or control to a bottom, but does so at the bottom's explicit instructions. Bottom submissive female in \\"Inspection\\" pose - used when Master / prospective Master has to inspect the submissive's body. In BDSM, bottom can mean either a submissive partner (see below) in sexual play (such as in being flogged, tied, humiliated, or made to serve), or a partner who receives stimulation from another, and who may or may not be submissive. A bottom in BDSM does not have to be the receptive partner; for example, a female dominant may command her submissive to penetrate her. Switch A switch is someone who participates in BDSM activities sometimes as a top and other times as a bottom or (in the case of dominance and submission) sometimes as a dominant and other times as a submissive. This is sometimes referred to as being versatile. Dominant and submissive Those who take the superior position in dominance and submission scenes and relationships are called dominants, doms (male) or dommes (female), while those who take the subordinate position are called submissives or subs (male or female). A top filling the dominant role is not necessarily a dominant, and vice versa, and a bottom is not necessarily submissive. The main difference between a dominant and a top is that the dominant ostensibly does not follow instructions, although they are limited by what the submissive is willing to do. The top may sometimes even be the partner who is following instructions, i.e., they top when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom. Contrast this with the pure dominant, who might give orders to a submissive, or otherwise employ physical or psychological techniques of control, but might instruct the submissive to perform the act on them. A gagged woman with bound hands sits in a submissive position. Her top holds her with a chain leash tied around her neck at Folsom Street Fair. The main difference between a submissive and a bottom is that the submissive ostensibly does not give instructions, although they do set limits on what the dominant can do. A bottom is not necessarily a submissive; they may enjoy intense physical and psychological stimulation but not submit to the person delivering it. Similarly, a submissive might not be a bottom; they may enjoy taking orders from a dominant without receiving any physical stimulation. For bottoms who are not submissive, the bottom is most often the partner who is giving instructions—the top typically tops when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom. Many distinguish top/bottom from dominant/submissive by seeing top/bottom as an expression of physical power, while dominant/submissive is an expression of psychological power. In many cases, the dominant/submissive relationship involves the dominant party psychologically tearing down and denigrating the submissive (consensually, meeting the submissive's expressed needs and respecting hard limits). In contrast, the top/bottom relationship is more commonly marked by mutual respect and support. Sadist and masochist The terms sadism and masochism, while reflecting a \\"do\\" vs. \\"done to\\" distinction similar to top and bottom, are more narrowly defined as the giving and receiving of pain (often referred to as 'sensation').

Following a six month pilot area review in 2014, it was proposed that the merger of Great Yarmouth College and Lowestoft College would result in improved education and training provision locally. The colleges have now formed a Federation as East Coast College. The colleges formally merged in the Summer of 2017 ready for the new academic year. East Coast College is a partner college of the University of Suffolk and the Lowestoft campus boasts specialist maritime and offshore training opportunities. The Sir Christopher Cockerell Building at East Coast Colleges Lowestoft campus East Coast Colleges Maritime Bridge Simulator History Records show that classes in science, navigation and astronomy were administered by the Town Council of Lowestoft in the late 19th century. The first Technical Institute was built in 1898 on a site in Clapham Road at a cost of £7,500. The site grew steadily for the next 40 years, developing a number of technical specialisms, together with courses in navigation and art. The Institute was damaged during enemy air action in 1940 and then completely destroyed in a second air attack in 1941. Accommodation was soon found for the provision of full-time instruction in Navigation at St John's Church schoolroom until the war's end. A School of Cookery was established during the war years and achieved great success. Following the war, the volume of work reduced through the withdrawal of naval personnel, but also through a lack of accommodation. The Institute had become seven disparate hired centres. Moreover, development, possible in other areas, had been difficult within Lowestoft due its fortress nature in the war years where the focus had been very much on the training of naval personnel. Day release classes associated with industry were unknown. 1947 saw the first of the \\"new\\" buildings, opened in Herring Fishery Score and in Victoria Road, Oulton Broad. They accommodated the Engineering and Commerce Departments as well as a Building Department. The latter, as well as the Engineering Department, organised the first day release classes and the long journey leading to the new College had begun. Throughout the post-war period the School of Art established itself, first in the old Morton Road School and then additionally in the Regent Road centre, where it flourished and soon joined the other departments, becoming an integral part of the new College of Further Education. Negotiations for a new and consolidated site began in 1952 and the present site was agreed in 1954, finally opening in 1965. Miss C. Musson MBE ATD ARCA was appointed first as head of the Lowestoft School of Art and later also as Principal of the Technical Institute and School of Navigation. She was the first woman to be admitted to membership of the Principals of Technical Institutions. Amongst many extraordinary accomplishments, one her most memorable was the organisation of 12 Domestic Science mistresses to train men in galley cooking for the Patrol Fleet based on Lowestoft. In four years 5,500 cooks were each given a six weeks course, and the health of the patrol boat crews improved in consequence. Maritime, Energy and Engineering Lowestoft has a strong Maritime heritage and the college has close links to the Maritime and Energy industries. Its specialist Maritime provision attracts many international students for Captaincy accreditation, as well as supporting the growing needs of the East of England's renewables sectors. Current facilities include Bridge Simulation, Electronic Navigation and Charting as well as Survival at Sea training where a range of severe weather conditions are simulated in a dedicated environmental pool.Merchant Navy Training The Sir Christopher Cockerell Building The Sir Christopher Cockerell building was opened in April 2007 by Lord Somerleyton and Frances Cockerell, daughter of Sir Christopher Cockerell CBE FRS, housing the Construction trades, Boat Building and Engineering.

The routes are the result of a joint venture between the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense to provide for high-speed, low-altitude military activities. Description Military Training Routes are divided into Instrument Routes (IR), and Visual Routes (VR). Each route is identified by either of these two letters, followed by either four digits for routes below 1,500 feet above ground level, or three digits for routes extending for at least one leg above 1,500 ft AGL. (i.e., VR-1056). The difference between the IR and VR routes is that IR routes are flown under Air Traffic Control, while VR routes are not. Airspace above the United States from the surface to 10,000 feet above sea level is limited to 250 knots (indicated airspeed) per the FAA's Federal Aviation Regulations. This speed limit hinders most modern-day tactical aircraft training operations, since low-level strikes are conducted almost exclusively at speeds exceeding 300 knots. Military Training Routes are usually limited to 420 knots, and in no case are aircraft allowed to exceed Mach 1 within United States sovereign airspace, except in designated Military Operation Areas. While on the route military aircraft squawk a Mode C Transponder code of '4000', which informs controllers that they are 'speeding' on a route. This squawk however is only legal by military aircraft, while inside a properly scheduled route corridor. MTRs do not constitute an official airspace, and are all open to VFR or IFR civilian traffic; however only military aircraft are allowed to squawk 4000 and exceed 250 knots. Each route is defined by a number of geographical coordinates and their respective navaid fixes. From this line the corridor is extended a specific number of miles, in the vast majority of cases this is five miles, making the corridor 10 miles wide. The Routes are individually operated through one of the local military air bases, which schedule and 'own' the route. The FAA requires these bases to 'NOTAM' out the routes at least two hours prior to use to allow for civilian traffic to de- conflict if needed..... Deconfliction It is important to note, that there is no official means of navigation for IR or VR routes. A VR route may be flown visually, and an IR route may be flown completely heads down (although this is rarely the case). Although ATC provides deconfliction for IR Routes, VR routes are flown completely independent of external separation. Since VFR traffic does not legally have to be squawking, this provides for a serious hazard to navigation. The FAA claims the military maximizes use of IR routes for this purpose, however the vast majority of military training flights on MTRs are on VR routes..... Sources The Department of Defense publication AP-1/B lists all military training routes in North America. Military training routes are depicted on FAA VFR sectional aeronautical charts as narrow gray lines with IR or VR designator prefixes.

Kalotermitidae includes 21 genera and 419 species. The family has a cosmopolitan circumtropical distribution, and is found in functionally arid environments. Biology The Kalotermitidae are \\"primitive\\" in morphology, nesting behavior, and social organization. Unlike other termite species, they have no need to make contact with soilArnett, Ross H. 2000. American Insects: A Handbook of the Insects of America North of Mexico. CRC Press. 2nd Edition. and live exclusively within excavations in wood, lacking elaborate nesting architecture. Drywood termites have an adaptive mechanism for conserving water. Undigested matter in the alimentary canal passes through specialized rectal glands in the hindgut. These glands reabsorb water from the feces. They can tolerate dry conditions for long periods of time, receiving all of the moisture they need from the wood they live in and consume. Their mandibles are also fortified with zinc, as an adaptation to the mechanically difficult food source of dry wood. Their diet of dry wood makes many of them economic and urban pests, causing damage to furniture, utility towers, stored wood, and buildings. Kalotermitids' global distribution may be partially attributable to rafting and timber movement.Abe T, Bignell DE, and Higashi M. 2000. Termites: Evolution, Sociality, Symbioses, Ecology. Kluwer Academic Publishers. The species Cryptotermes brevis is particularly prevalent as a pest in the United States, and is found in Hawaii, Florida, and along the southeastern coast. Reproduction Like other termites, the Kalotermitidae are eusocial. However, their caste distinction is relatively flexibleNoiot C. 1985. Pathways of Caste Development in the Lower Termites in \\"Caste Determination in Social Insects.\\" and they lack a true worker caste; instead, pseudergates (\\"false workers\\")\\"Termite Larvae Info\\" serve as workers before developing into adult soldiers or alates. The appearance of immature workers in the Kalotermitidae is possible because of their hemimetabolous lifecycle; these immatures are \\"false\\" workers because, unlike in the holometabolous eusocial groups, no pupal stage clearly demarcates immaturity and adulthood, and their role as workers is temporary. Pseudergates can be differentiated from other categories of immatures by the absence of wing buds (which are already present in most hemimetabolous insects in their first instar) and are not necessarily the only constituent of the general work force in a kalotermitid colony. Alates fly during warm, sunny days, when temperatures range from . They emerge from exit holes in wood and take off in all directions. They exhibit phototropic behavior during dispersal flights, often aggregating at lights, with at least one species showing a preference for light with a wavelength between 460 and 550 nm. After landing, they break off their wings which they do by holding their wingtips against a substrate and turning until the wing breaks off at the base. Dealates find a mate and engage in courtship activity. King and Queen mate for life. Systematics The Kalotermitidae belong to the \\"lower termites\\", a now-defunct paraphyletic assemblage which classifies termites based on the presence (\\"lower\\") or absence (\\"higher\\") of endosymbiotic gut flagellates in addition to bacteria.Inward DJ, Vogler AP, and Eggleton P. 2007. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of termites (Isoptera) illuminates key aspects of their evolutionary biology. The \\"lower\\" termites include all termite families except the Termitidae, which alone constitute the \\"higher\\" termites. Recent phylogenetic studies have supported the Kalotermitidae as a monophyletic group. The Kalotermitidae have no recognized classification above genera, the relationships between which are still largely unknown and poorly studied. Limited molecular evidence supports the genus Kalotermes as a basal lineage within the family, so is one of the most anciently diversifying, as well as having two major branches, in which Kalotermes is sister to Ceratokalotermes. However, this partially contradicts older morphological phylogenies, and is the result of a study limited to eight genera.

Mayne won the annual Carnegie Medal recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Set in the Yorkshire Dales, it is a simple story subtly told, steeped in the past and with a strong sense of place. The story of the hunt for a lost treasure is interwoven with descriptions of daily life on a farm and of the local scenery. Plot summary When Adam Forrest comes to re-paint the outside of the Unicorn Inn in Vendale he is determined to make sense of an old story told in the Dyson and Owland families. Long ago, it is said, Dyson the innkeeper desired to marry Gertrude Owland, the daughter of a knight, who lived on the other side of the ridge in Thoradale. She was willing, but the knight refused permission and trained a pack of hounds, together with a fierce unicorn brought from overseas, to defend her. Dyson used magic to entice the animals into the land of the fairies under the fell, while he eloped with Gertrude. However, he did not know that all the Owland fortune was in the collars of the animals, and he was later drowned by the fairies while trying to retrieve it. According to local legend, the hounds can sometimes still be heard hunting under the hill. Mary and Nan Owland live at Lew Farm, near the site of the old Owland house. Mary is young enough to believe in the fairies of the tale and to believe that the hounds and the unicorn are still alive under the fell, while her older sister Nan does not believe any of it. Adam thinks there is a common-sense explanation and, quite possibly, a treasure to find. While repainting the inn sign he finds an ancient hunting horn embedded in the frame. He guesses that Dyson used it to draw the hounds towards a steep black cliff between the dales known as Yowncorn Yat (local dialect for \\"Unicorn Gate\\"), the cliff having acted as an echo wall. One night Mary sneaks out to Yowncorn Yat and crawls through a tunnel under the hill which she thinks is an entrance to fairyland. She catches one of the \\"hounds\\", which turns out to be a fox, and unknowingly picks up some silver treasure and a horned skull at the bottom of a mineshaft. The ending is thus ambiguous, with Adam sure he has worked it all out rationally, except that he cannot account for the skull, which it seems could only have belonged to a unicorn.

One of William Mayne's earlier novels, it shares several features with his other books of the period. These include an unusual treasure hunt, a problem to be resolved, the lack of \\"heroes\\" or \\"villains\\", and the slow revelation of character through dialogue.The Continuum Encyclopaedia of Children's Literature, Bernice E. Cullinan and Diana Goetz Person, Continuum, 2001, pp. 526–27. It followed Mayne's The World Upside Down (1954) in being partly set in Vendale, also the scene of Earthfasts (1966) which is known for its TV adaptation. The emphasis on the geographical setting, as seen through the eyes of a child, is also typical of Mayne's style. It has been said that his stories grow inevitably out of their settings.Treasure Seekers and Borrowers, Marcus Crouch, Library Association, 1962, p. 120. The resolution of the novel provides a satisfactory balance of old and new, traditional story and modern fact, magic and science.Written for Children, John Rowe Townsend, Penguin revised edition, 1987, pp. 258–59.

The Modern Olympics p. 13 These games were one of the first revivals of the ancient Olympic Games in the modern era. Their success provided further inspirationYoung (2004), p.144 for William Penny Brookes in England, whose games had been running since 1850, and the International Olympic Committee series from 1896. Zappas' contribution in this process was vital: not only were the games hosted at his own initiative, he also provided the funds for the staging of the games, as well as for the construction of much-needed infrastructure, including the refurbishment of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium, which hosted the Games of 1870 and 1875. The same stadium would also host the first IOC Games of 1896,Findling, Pelle (2004), p. 13 the 1906 Intercalated Games, and archery and the marathon finish at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. Revival of the Olympics Statue of Evangelos Zappas, sponsor of the Games (a work of Ioannis Kossos). Sporadic references to the revival of the ancient Olympic Games were made by various personalities during the 19th century, inspired by a certain degree of romanticism. In his 1833 poem Dialogue of the Dead, the Constantinople-born, Panagiotis Soutsos editor of a Greek newspaper, used the Olympic Games as the symbol of the ancient Greek traditions. Soon after, he explicitly proposed the revival of the games by the newly formed Greek state, even sending a memorandum to that effect to the Greek government in 1835.Matthews (1904) p. 42Landry, Landry, Yerlès (1991), pp. 102, 114Young (2004), p. 141 His proposal was accepted by King Otto of Greece, but in the event, nothing was done, despite Soutsos' persistent campaigning over the next twenty six years.Young (2004), pp. 141–142 and p.7 In 1852, the German archaeologist Ernst Curtius, during a romantic lecture, also stated that the Olympic events would be revived. Evangelis Zappas, a successful businessman and member of the Greek diaspora in Romania, was inspired by Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition through his own efforts and resources.Matthews (1904) p. 46 In early 1856, Zappas sent a letter through diplomatic channels to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund the entire project of the Olympic revival, providing also cash prizes for the victors.Gerlach (2004) p. 25Young (2004), p. 142 However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was a wide belief among part of the Greek politicians (notably Charilaos Trikoupis and Stephanos Dragoumis) that athletic games were just a throwback to archaic times. They feared that Greece would seem primitive among the leading nations of Europe if it revived, as they claimed, an old-fashioned and pagan festival.Golden (2008), p. 129 Characteristically, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletic lobby in Athens, Alexandros Rangavis, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletic event:Brownell (2008) p. 36 For months there was no official answer from the Greek government. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos, which made Zappas' efforts widely known to the public, triggered a series of events. Finally, Otto agreed upon competitions at four-year intervals, on the occasion of industrial and agricultural expositions, and allowed the realization of athletic events with Zappas' full sponsorship. Consequently, Zappas offered the necessary funds to the Greek government in order to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.Hill (1992) p. 16 Olympics Games of 1859 Ticket of the first Zappas Olympics of 1859 On November 15, 1859, the first modern revival of the athletic Olympic Games took place in Athens. As the renovation of the ancient Panathenaic stadium was not yet complete, the contests were held in Loudovikou square in Athens (modern Koumoundourou square).Young (2004), p. 145 Although they could be termed as the first Olympic Games of the present tradition, it was far from being an international festival.Landry, Landry, Yerlès (1991) pp. 103–104 They had a distinctly national character, since the participants were exclusively of Greek ethnicity, coming both from inside the independent Greek state and the Greek diaspora of the Ottoman Empire. Athletes competed in a variety of disciplines, similar to those of the ancient Olympic games: running, discus, javelin throwing, wrestling, jumping and pole climbing. Attendees included the king, officers and other dignitaries in rows of seats, as well as half of the inhabitants of Athens in the stands. Since it was one of the first mass gatherings in the city's modern history, neither the people nor the police had any previous experience with maintaining the order at such an event.Foundation of the Hellenic world. Olympics through time. Olympic revival, first attempts, Zappeian Olympics. The press of that time lauded the Games as being positive, but they were a disappointment for thousands of Athenians who could not see anything from the rear stands and who did not understand this kind of event. The site was also unsuited for the sports and the weather was too cold.Findling, Pelle (2004), p. 12Young (2004), p. 146 Moreover, the athletic competition had a more game-like than sportive character: as the competitors were not individuals who were seriously dedicated to athletics, the Organising Committee accepted the participation of workers, porters, etc., who were attracted by the monetary prizes of the Games. According to the press of the time, many comical incidents took place during the games: for instance, a policeman, who was assigned to watch over the crowds, left his post and participated in the races. Even a beggar, who pretended to be blind, participated in the races. The Committee of the Wenlock Olympian Class, brainchild of the English doctor and surgeon Royal College of Surgeons William Penny Brookes, sent £10 to Athens for a prize for the best runner in the longest race at the Olympic Games. The Wenlock Prize was the largest prize on offer and was won by Petros Velissarios of Smyrna from the Ottoman Empire who was ethnically Greek. Games of 1870 Panathenaic Stadium at the first day of the 1896 Olympics. Evangelis Zappas planned to sponsor future Olympic Games and restore the Olympiad, but he died in 1865; however, he left a vast fortune, both for the construction of permanent facilities in the Greek capital, as well as for the continuation of the Olympic Games in four-year intervals.Gerlach (2004) p. 29 In July 1869, the dates of the 1870 Olympics were announced, followed by organizational plans and proposals about which events to include. The committee paid for participating athletes to undergo three months of training prior to the Games. This training took place in the Panathenaic Stadium, which had been cleaned and leveled. The Games of 1870 took place like the training in the Panathenaic stadium, which was excavated, restored and provided with wooden benches in order to accommodate 30,000 people, a huge number for the time.Young (2004), p. 148 In general the contest was much better organized and athletes were uniformly dressed, with sport costumes and sandals in skin color. On November 1, the Games were officially opened, but athletic events were postponed to November 15 due to bad weather, which also forced the cancellation of all nautical events, horse races and shooting events. Athletes included Greek nationals, as well as ethnic Greeks from the Ottoman EmpireYoung (1996), p. 45 and CreteYoung (1996), p. 44 (then a semi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty). Some 20,000 to 25,000 spectators watched the 31 athletes who had previously qualified compete in a variety of events. Before the competition started, the athletes were asked to take an oath that they would compete in a fair manner. At the same time, the Games included a competition in the arts. As in 1859 winners received a cash prize; in addition, the first three winners received olive wreaths and small branches of olive and laurel. There was a band playing an Olympic Hymn, specially composed for the occasion. The judges were professors of the University of Athens, and there was a herald for announcing the winners. King George I was awarding the prizes to the winners at the sound of the music. The 1870 Games were an enormous success and the press dedicated triumphant articles both to the excellent organization and to the accomplishments of the Games. Games of 1875 Gold medal for the 1875 Olympics Planning for the 1875 competition began in 1871, and in 1873, the foundation for the Zappeion was laid. The 3rd Olympiad was organized by the Director of the Public Gymnasium, Ioannis Fokianos. Fokianos strongly believed that the ideal of gymnastics would expand from above, i.e. the upper classes, through the educated and cultured classes. For that reason, he excluded all participants except for university students. All these students were trained in the Public Gymnasium in Athens in a series of gymnastic exercises introduced by Fokianos and inspired from the German system of gymnastics. The athletes were impressively dressed: white trousers and white shirts with a large blue stripe, which was, until 1896, the official uniform for gymnastics. These contests were timed to coincide with an exposition of 1,200 Greek and 72 foreign exhibitors, the largest Greece had ever seen. The Greek royal family did not attend. There was not enough space for huge crowds that attended, who finally filled up the arena of the Stadium. Dissatisfaction ensued, and Fokianos was considered responsible despite his great efforts and the very good training of the athletes. The press heavily criticized the Games not only for the lack of organization, but also because the organizers had disqualified the working classes from competing.Young (2004), pp. 148-149 Fokianos became so embittered that he resigned as overall leader of the Olympics. However, the artistic competition of the Olympics proved a great success: 25 composers won awards in music and 25 sculptors and painters were honored. Games of 1888–89 Front view of the landmark Zappeion exhibition center which is a short walk from the Panathenaic stadium. After an extended period of litigation between the Greek government and a group of Zappas' relatives over Zappas' bequests, Konstantinos Zappas secured the execution of Zappas' will. The Greek government used Zappas' money to complete the Gymnasterion, a central gym, in 1878, and to continue the work on the Zappeion exhibition center, which had begun in 1873 and was frequently interrupted. The Zappeion officially opened on October 20, 1888. As in 1875, Fokianos took charge of the sporting events (but did so independently of the earlier Olympic Committee), which were postponed up till April 30, 1889. These Games were not co-ordinated by the Olympic Committee that organised the 1859, 1870, and 1875 Zappas Games, but by Fokianos alone. Thirty athletes competed in a variety of disciplines including discus, pole long leap (over a ditch), weightlifting, mast climbing, and rope climbing among others. All participants were clad alike. In 1890, a royal decree, signed by Crown Prince Constantine and the foreign minister Stephanos Dragoumis, announced that the Olympiad would be reinstated, at four- year intervals, from 1888. The next Olympics were officially planned for 1892, but did not take place due to the Greek government's claim of lack of funding.Young (2004), p. 151 In the event, the Panathenaic stadium would be used to stage the Olympic Games in 1896, the first to be held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. Aftermath and influence on the rebirth of the Olympics The English physician William Penny Brookes had initiated a sports movement in the United Kingdom, founding the Wenlock Olympian Games in 1850.Minute Book 1, p. 1 WOS archives These were organised by the Wenlock Olympian Class which changed its name to the Wenlock Olympian Society in 1860.Shrewsbury Chronicle 23rd November 1860 Dr Brookes adopted an event from the programme of the 1859 Zappas Games and included 'throwing the javelin at a target' into the much-expanded 1861 Wenlock Olympian Games. The first man to be placed on the honor roll of the Wenlock Olympian Society was the Smyrniot Petros Velissariou, who competed at the 1859 Athens Olympic Games in the distance running and who won a prize donated by the Wenlock Olympian Society's Committee.Minute Booke 1 WOS archives 1860 Games report Brookes was the first to propose holding open international Olympics to be held in Athens, as distinct from the revived Greek national Olympics of 1859, 1870 and 1875 which mirrored the Ancient Olympics as they were closed to all but Greek- speaking competitors.Young, D. The Modern Olympics p.4 Despite his persistent pleas for action to the Greek government, his proposals fell on deaf ears.Young (2004), p. 150 However, many of the ideas that Dr Brookes used within the Wenlock Olympian Games were subsequently adopted by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who was familiarized with them in a visit to Wenlock in 1890.Landry, Landry, Yerlès (1991) p. 102Young (2004), pp. 150-151 Zappas' legacy to the revival of the Olympic Games, alongside Soustos, Brookes and later Coubertin, was significant.Young (2004), p. 144 In addition, the Panathenaic stadium, which was refurbished with his funding, went on to host events in the 1896, 1906 and 2004 IOC Olympics, while the Zappeion hosted fencing events in 1896, was the site of the first Olympic Village in 1906 (hosting the Hungarian Olympic team), and used as the media center during the 2004 Athens Olympic Games.Zappas.org Timeline References Sources     * Category:Modern history of Athens Category:Sports competitions in Athens Category:19th century in Greece Category:1859 in Greece Category:1859 in sports Category:1870 in Greece Category:1870 in sports Category:1875 in Greece Category:1875 in sports Category:Multi-sport events in Greece Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1859 Category:Athletics in Athens ","title":"Zappas Olympics"},{"id":"24356867","text":"Aaron Patzer (born November 20, 1980) is an Internet entrepreneur and the founder of Mint.com, a financial management tool which was acquired by Intuit and had over 10 million users as of mid-2012. Biography Born in Madison, Wisconsin, Patzer graduated from Central High School in Evansville, Indiana. He completed his undergraduate studies in 2002 with a BSEE from Duke University. In 2004, he completed an MSEE from Princeton University. Patzer began his career in the Internet boom years of 1998–2000, working for Getawebsite.com and Miadora.com (an online jewelry store).  Mint.com  After a number of engineering positions and Internet startups, Patzer founded Mint.com in March 2006. According to Patzer, the inspiration for Mint.com came to him in late 2005 after being frustrated with how difficult it was to use the Intuit Quicken product. Patzer developed the full alpha version of Mint.com (in Java J2EE and MySQL) in 2006 before he met Josh Kopelman (founder of half.com) and Rob Hayes at a STIRR dinner in the fall of 2006.blog posting The meeting led to funding, and Patzer launched Mint.com at the TechCrunch40 conference a year later, in September 2007, winning the $50K first prize.TechCrunch.com, \\"Mint Wins TechCrunch40 Top Company Award; Takes $50,000 Prize\\" link In September 2008, Patzer was listed in Inc. magazine's Top 30 Under 30.\\"The Number Cruncher\\" On September 14, 2009, Intuit announced that it would buy Mint.com for US$170M. Patzer was criticized for selling the company for too little. At the time of the announced sale, Mint.com had an estimated 1.5 million users. Patzer joined Intuit as VP Product Innovation, and he is also working on a new personal transportation system. Post-Mint In 2011, TechCrunch reported that Patzer's next project would be called \\"Swift\\" and was exploring the \\"feasibility of building a personal maglev vehicle transit system.\\" According to Patzer, he was splitting his time between the new venture and his position at Intuit. He left Intuit in December 2012 in order to be able to focus on his new ventures. Patzer founded Leonardo Software Inc. in September 2013.  Fountain.com  In 2013, Patzer launched Fountain.com along with Jean Sini, CTO. The main benefit to using Fountain is that you can connect with any expert, on mostly any topic, for free from your smartphone. Fountain.com was sold to Porch.com in October 2015. Patzer stepped down as CEO and did not join Porch. Instead, he relocated overseas for personal reasons. Sini became the leader of Porch's San Francisco office.

Jane Nassau Senior (1828–1877) was Britain's first female civil servant, and a philanthropist. She was co-founder of the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants (MABYS). Life Senior was born Jane Elizabeth Hughes at Uffington on 10 December 1828, daughter of John Hughes and the only sister of the author Thomas Hughes and five other brothers. Senior's relief work with material aid for the victims of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 supported the National Society for Aid to Sick and Wounded in War, which was later renamed the British Red Cross. She was involved directing the practical work of handling donations. Work with impoverished children in Surrey led to Senior's appointment in 1873, as an assistant inspector of workhouses. This post was given to her by James Stansfeld, against civil service opposition. The goal of the post was a Civil Service Report, which she framed as covering both pauper girls as school children, and their histories after school. When the Report appeared in 1875, the 1874 general election having intervened, it was the subject of heavy criticism by Carleton Tuffnell, acting in concert with The Times. A meeting called by Thomas Vincent Fosbery in May 1874, at Lambeth Palace, brought together Elizabeth Browne, wife of Harold Browne the bishop of Winchester, Senior, Catharine Tait, wife of Archibald Tait, and Mary Elizabeth Townsend (1841–1918). They agreed to go about setting up the Girls' Friendly Society, founded on 1 January 1875. MABYS was founded in 1876, to support young single servant girls, with a different group, Senior not finding enough common ground with the senior Anglicans. She died of 'cancer of the womb' and exhaustion on 24 March 1877, aged 48; and is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.Oldfield, pp. 285 Associations G. F. Watts the artist had become a confidant of Jane Senior by the mid-1850s; they corresponded, and most of the letters have been destroyed. Octavia Hill, governess for a time to the children of Thomas Hughes, became a close friend. Senior was a friend and correspondent of the novelist George Eliot. In Clapham, Senior knew Marianne Thornton, figure of the Clapham Sect and daughter of Henry Thornton, and her niece Henrietta Synnot, both of whom were involved in local schooling. Synnot became her assistant. Caroline Stephen made a very positive impression, and was an influence for the future. In the aftermath of the \\"Eyre controversy\\", she made a point of inviting Emelia Russell Gurney, wife of Russell Gurney, to show her Jamaica sketches. In the early 1870s Senior worked with Henrietta Rowland, teaching literacy in Whitechapel. Another associate of this period was Menella Bute Smedley, following up on girls who had left workhouse schools. For MABYS, Senior called on Bessie Belloc, Barbara Bodichon and Mrs. Knox for support. Family Jane married Nassau John Senior, son of Nassau William Senior, on 10 August 1848 at Shaw Church. Her husband was a barrister, but failed to make more than a desultory career in the law. From 1860 they lived in Clapham, taking lodgers. The marriage was unhappy. They had a son Walter Nassau (1850–1933). He married Mabel Barbara Hammersley, daughter of Hugh Hammersley and his mother's friend Dulcibella Eden, in 1888. Dorothea Murray Hughes (1891–1952), daughter of Senior's brother Hastings Hughes, was a nurse and aid worker. She wrote Jane Elizabeth Senior: A Memoir (1915).

Under the Constitution of Mexico, the President is the chief of the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander in chief of the Mexican Armed Forces. The current president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office on 1 December 2018. The office of the president is considered to be revolutionary, in the sense that the powers of office are derived from the Revolutionary Constitution of 1917. Another legacy of the Mexican Revolution is the Constitution's ban on re- election. Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, called a sexenio. No one who has held the post, even on a caretaker basis, is allowed to run or serve again. The constitution and the office of the President closely follow the presidential system of government. Requirements to hold office Chapter III of Title III of the Constitution deals with the executive branch of government and sets forth the powers of the president, as well as the qualifications for the office. He is vested with the \\"supreme executive power of the Union\\". To be eligible to serve as president, Article 82 of the Constitution specifies that the following requirements must be met: * Be a natural-born citizen of Mexico (\\"mexicano por nacimiento\\") able to exercise full citizenship rights, with at least one parent who is a natural-born citizen of Mexico. * Be a resident of Mexico for at least twenty (20) years. * Be thirty-five years of age or older at the time of the election. * Be a resident of Mexico for the entire year prior to the election (although absences of 30 days or fewer are explicitly stated not to interrupt residency). * Not be an official or minister of any church or religious denomination. * Not be in active military service during the six months prior to the election. * Not be a secretary of state or under-secretary of state, attorney general, governor of a state, or head of the government of Mexico City, unless \\"separated from the post\\" (resigned or been granted permanent leave of absence) at least six months prior to the election. * Not have been president already, even in a provisional capacity (see Succession below). The ban on any sort of presidential re-election dates back to the aftermath of the Porfiriato and the Mexican Revolution, which erupted after Porfirio Díaz's fraudulent victory on his 7th re-election in a row. It is so entrenched in Mexican politics that it has remained in place even as it was relaxed for other offices. In 2014, the constitution was amended to allow city mayors, congressmen and senators to run for a second consecutive term. Previously, Deputies and Senators were barred from successive re-election. However, the president remained barred from re-election, even if it is nonsuccessive. The Constitution does not establish formal academic qualifications to serve as president. Most presidents during the 19th Century and early 20th century, however, had careers in one of two fields: the armed forces (typically the army) or the law. President Manuel Ávila Camacho (1940-46) was the last president to have been a career military officer. Most of his successors have been lawyers; in fact, all the presidents between 1958 and 1988 graduated from law school. Presidents Salinas (1988-94) and Zedillo (1994-2000) were both trained as economists. Since the democratic transition, presidents have a wider academic background. Although presidents Calderón (2006-12) and Peña Nieto (2012-18) were both lawyers, president Fox (2000-06) studied business administration and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the current president, studied political sciences. Presidential elections The presidential term was set at four years from 1821 to 1904, when President Porfirio Díaz extended it to six years for the first time in Mexico's history, and then again from 1917 to 1928 after a new constitution reversed the change made by Diaz in 1904. Finally, the presidential term was set at six years in 1928 and has remained unchanged since then. The president is elected by direct, popular, universal suffrage. Whoever wins a simple plurality of the national vote is elected; there is no runoff election. The current President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected in 2018 with a modern-era record of 53% of the popular vote in 2018. The most recent former president, Enrique Peña Nieto won 38% of the popular vote in 2012. Former President Felipe Calderón won with 36.38% of the votes in the 2006 general election, finishing only 0.56% above his nearest rival, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (who contested the official results). In 2000, former President Vicente Fox was elected with a plurality of 43% of the popular vote, Ernesto Zedillo won 48.7% of the vote in 1994, and his predecessor Carlos Salinas won with a majority of 50.4% in the 1988 election. The history of Mexico has not been a peaceful one. After the fall of dictator Porfirio Díaz in 1910 following the Mexican Revolution, there was no stable government until 1929, when all the revolutionary leaders united in one political party: the National Revolutionary Party, which later changed its name to the Party of the Mexican Revolution, and is now the Institutional Revolutionary Party (). From then until 1988, the PRI ruled Mexico as a virtual one-party state. Toward the end of his term, the incumbent president in consultation with party leaders, selected the PRI's candidate in the next election in a procedure known as \\"the tap of the finger\\" (). Until 1988, the PRI's candidate was virtually assured of election, winning by margins well over 70 percent of the vote. In 1988, however, the PRI ruptured and the dissidents formed the National Democratic Front with rival center-left parties (now the PRD). Discontent with the PRI, and the popularity of the Front's candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas led to worries that PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari would not come close to a majority, and might actually be defeated. While the votes were being counted, the tabulation system mysteriously shut down. The government declared Salinas the winner, leading to allegations of electoral fraud. The 1997 federal congressional election saw the first opposition Chamber of Deputies ever, and the 2000 elections saw Vicente Fox of a PAN/PVEM alliance become the first opposition candidate to win an election since 1911. This historical defeat was accepted on election night by the PRI in the voice of President Zedillo; while this calmed fears of violence, it also fueled questions about the role of the president in the electoral process and to whom the responsibility of conceding defeat should fall in a democratic election. The role of unions in the new balance of power and future elections is documented in works like historian Enrique Krauze's Analysis of the Corporative System. President-elect After a presidential election, political parties may issue challenges to the election. These challenges are heard by the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judicial Power; after it has heard and ruled on them, the Tribunal must either declare the election invalid or certify the results of the elections in accordance to their rulings. Once the Tribunal declares the election valid, it issues a \\"Certificate of Majority\\" (Constancia de Mayoría) to the candidate who obtained a plurality. That candidate then becomes President-elect. The final decision is made in September, two months after the election. Presidential powers The 1917 Constitution borrowed heavily from the Constitution of the United States, providing for a clear separation of powers while giving the president wider powers than his American counterpart. For the first 71 years after the enactment of the 1917 Constitution, the president exercised nearly absolute control over the country. Much of this power came from the de facto monopoly status of the PRI. As mentioned above, he effectively chose his successor as president by personally nominating the PRI's candidate in the next election. In addition, the unwritten rules of the PRI allowed him to designate party officials and candidates all the way down to the local level. He thus had an important (but not exclusive) influence over the political life of the country (part of his power had to be shared with unions and other groups, but as an individual, he had no peers). This and his constitutional powers made some political commentators describe the president as a six-year dictator, and to call this system an \\"imperial presidency\\". The situation remained largely unchanged until the early 1980s when a grave economic crisis created discomfort both in the population and inside the party, and the president's power was no longer absolute but still impressive. An important characteristic of this system is that the new president was effectively chosen by the old one (since the PRI candidate was assured of election) but once he assumed power, the old one lost all power and influence (\\"no reelection\\" is a cornerstone of Mexican politics). In fact, tradition called for the incumbent president to fade into the background during the campaign to elect his successor. This renewed command helped maintain party discipline and avoided the stagnation associated with a single man holding power for decades, prompting Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa to call Mexico's political system \\"the perfect dictatorship\\" since the president's powers were cloaked by democratic practice. With the democratic reforms of recent years and fairer elections, the president's powers have been limited in fact as well as in name. Vargas Llosa, during the Fox administration, called this new system \\"The Imperfect Democracy\\". The current rights and powers of the president of Mexico are established, limited and enumerated by Article 89 of the Constitution which include the following: * Promulgate and execute the laws enacted by the Congress, providing in the administrative sphere to its exact observance; * Appoint and remove freely the Secretaries of State, remove the ambassadors, consuls general and senior employees of the Treasury, appoint and remove freely all other employees of the Union whose appointment or removal is not otherwise in the Constitution or in laws; * Appoint, with Senate approval, ambassadors, consuls general, superior employees of the Treasury and members of collegial bodies of regulation in telecommunications, energy and economic competition; * Appoint, with the approval of the Senate, the colonels and other senior officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force; * Preserve national security, under the terms of the respective law, and have all of the permanent Armed Forces i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force for internal security and external defense of the Federation; * Having the National Guard to the same objects, in the terms that prevent Section IV of Article 76; * Declare war on behalf of the United Mexican States with consent from the Congress of the Union; * Intervene in the appointment of the Attorney General of the Republic and delete it, in terms of the provisions of Article 102, Section A, of this Constitution; * Conduct foreign policy and conclude international treaties and finish, denounce, suspend, modify, amend, remove reservations and issuing interpretative statements thereon, and submitting to the approval of the Senate. In conducting such a policy, the Chief Executive shall observe the following normative principles: self-determination of peoples; nonintervention; the peaceful settlement of disputes; the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations; the legal equality of States; international cooperation for development; respect, protection and promotion of human rights and the struggle for international peace and security; * Convene Congress into special session, when agreed by the Standing Committee; * Provide the judiciary the aid they need for the expeditious exercise of its functions; * Enable all classes of ports, establish maritime and border customs and designate their location; * Grant, according to law, pardons to criminals convicted of crimes jurisdiction of the federal courts; * Grant exclusive privileges for a limited time, in accordance with the respective law, to discoverers, inventors or perfectors in any branch of industry; * When the Senate is not in session, the President of the Republic may make appointments mentioned in sections III, IV and IX, with the approval of the Standing Committee; * At any time, opt for a coalition government with one or more of the political parties represented in Congress. * To submit to the Senate, the three candidates for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and submit their resignations to the approval of licenses and Senate itself; * Objecting the appointment of commissioners body that sets the guarantor Article 6. of this Constitution made by the Senate, under the terms established in this Constitution and the law; * The others expressly conferred by this Constitution. A decree is a legislative instrument that has an expiration date and that is issued by one of the three branches of government. Congress may issue decrees, and the President may issue decrees as well. However, they have all the power of laws, but cannot be changed except by the power that issued them. Decrees are very limited in their extent. One such decree is the federal budget, which is issued by Congress. The president's office may suggest a budget, but at the end of the day, it is Congress that decrees how to collect taxes and how to spend them. A Supreme Court ruling on Vicente Fox's veto of the 2004 budget suggests that the President may have the right to veto decrees from Congress. Since 1997, the Congress has been plural, usually with opposition parties having a majority. Major reforms (tax, energy) have to pass by Congress, and the ruling President usually found his efforts blocked: the PRI's Zedillo by opposing PAN/PRD congressmen, and later the PAN's Fox by the PRI and PRD. The PAN would push the reforms it denied to the PRI and vice versa. This situation, novel in a country where Congress was +90% dominated by the president's party for most of the century, has led to a legal analysis of the president's power. Formerly almost a dictator (because of PRI's party discipline), the current times show the president's power as somewhat limited. In 2004, President Fox threatened to veto the budget approved by Congress, claiming the budget overstepped his authority to lead the country, only to learn no branch of government had the power to veto a decree issued by another branch of government (although a different, non jurisprudence-setting ruling stated he could return the budget with observations). Oath of office Upon taking office, the President raises his/her right arm to shoulder-level and takes the following oath: Translation: Presidential sash and flag Ensign of the President, for use aboard naval vessels The Mexican Presidential sash has the colors of the Mexican flag in three bands of equal width, with green on top, white in the center, and red on the bottom, worn from right shoulder to left waist; it also includes the National Seal, in gold thread, to be worn chest-high. In November 2018, a reform was made on Article 34 reordering the colors of the sash. A new sash was made putting the colors of the sash back to the previous order that was used from 1924 through 2009. In swearing-in ceremonies, the outgoing President turns in the sash to the current President of the Chamber of Deputies, who in turn gives it to the new president after the latter has sworn the oath of office. The sash is the symbol of the Executive Federal Power, and may only be worn by the current President. According to Article 35 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag, and Anthem, the President must wear the sash at the swearing-in ceremony, when he makes his annual State of the Union report to Congress, during the commemoration of the Grito de Dolores on 15 September of each year, and when he receives the diplomatic credentials of accredited foreign ambassadors and ministers. He is also expected to wear it \\"in those official ceremonies of greatest solemnity\\". The sash is worn from right shoulder to left hip, and should be worn underneath the coat. The only exception is during the swearing-in ceremony, when it is worn over the coat so that the out-going president may easily take the sash off and drape it over the incoming president (Article 36). In addition to the Presidential Sash, each president receives a Presidential Flag; the flag has imprinted the words Estados Unidos Mexicanos in golden letters and the national coat of arms also in gold. Presidential residence Since the beginning of his term, the official residence of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been the National Palace, a building facing the Mexico City Zócalo. The President also has the use of Chapultepec Castle, formerly an Imperial palace of the Second Mexican Empire, and afterwards the official residence of Mexican presidents until the Presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas in 1937. The National Palace is also the formal seat of the Executive Power and had been the official seat of power in Mexico since early colonial times, until it was moved in 1937 to Los Pinos. Succession Article 84 of the Mexican Constitution states that \\"in case of absolute absence of a President\\" the following should happen: * Until Congress names a Substitute or Interim President, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretario de Gobernación) assumes executive powers provisionally (Presidente Provisional), but cannot make changes to the cabinet without advice and consent from the Senate. He must also provide an official report of his actions within ten days of leaving the post. Congress must elect an Interim or Substitute President within 60 days of the original absence. The Secretary of the Interior is not required to meet all requirements for the Presidency; specifically, he is not required to meet the age or residency requirements, nor the requirement to not hold certain government positions (secretary of state, under-secretary of state, etc.) * If Congress is not in session, then the Permanent Commission calls Congress to an extraordinary session, at which point the process continues as below. * If the absence (death, impeachment, etc.) should occur in the first two years of the term, Congress (if in session, or after being called to extraordinary session by the Permanent Commission) must elect, by a majority of votes in a secret ballot with a quorum of at least two-thirds of its members, an Interim President (Presidente Interino). Congress must also call for elections in no less than 14 months and no more than 18 months after the absence of the President occurs; the person who wins those elections will be president for the remainder of the original six-year presidential term. * If the absence should occur in the last four years of the term, Congress (if in session, or after being called to extraordinary session by the Permanent Commission) will select a Substitute President (Presidente Substituto) by a majority of votes in a secret ballot as above. The Substitute President will be President of the United Mexican States until the end of the original six-year presidential term, at which point regular elections are held. No person who has already served as president, whether elected, provisional, interim, or substitute, can be designated as provisional, interim, or substitute president. The designation of the Secretary of the Interior as the immediate successor dates to August 2012, when the changes to the Constitution were published in the Official Diary. The succession provisions have come into play only twice since the current constitution was enacted. In 1928, after the assassination of president-elect Álvaro Obregón, Congress appointed Emilio Portes Gil as Interim President; Portes Gil served in the position for 14 months while new elections were called. Pascual Ortiz Rubio was elected president in the special elections that followed in 1930, but he resigned in 1932. Abelardo L. Rodríguez was then appointed Interim President to fill out the remainder of Ortiz Rubio's term (under current law Rodríguez would be Substitute President, but at the time there was no distinction between Interim, Substitute, and Provisional presidents). Living former presidents There are six living former presidents. The most recent former president to die was Miguel de la Madrid (1982–1988), on 1 April 2012.

However, the pensions were abolished and terminated in 2018. Contrary to what happens in many other countries, former presidents of Mexico do not continue to be important national figures once out of office, and usually lead a discreet life. This is partly because they do not want to interfere with the government of the new president and partly because they may not have a good public image. This tradition can be traced back to the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas. Former president Plutarco Elías Calles had personally selected Cárdenas as his successor, and had hoped to control things from behind the scenes as he had for the previous five years. However, when Cárdenas showed he was going to rule in fact as well as in name, Calles publicly criticized him, prompting Cárdenas to have Calles escorted out of the country by military police. Cárdenas himself remained silent on the policies of his successor Manuel Ávila Camacho, establishing a tradition that former presidents do not interfere with their successors. For example, Ernesto Zedillo holds important offices in the United Nations and in the private sector, but outside of Mexico. It is speculated he lives in a self-imposed exile to avoid the hatred of some of his fellow members of the PRI for having acknowledged the PRI's defeat in the 2000 presidential election. Carlos Salinas de Gortari also lived in a self-imposed exile in Ireland, but returned to Mexico. He campaigned intensely to have his brother, Raúl Salinas, freed after he was jailed in the early days of Zedillo's term, accused of drug trafficking and planning the assassination of José Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Carlos Salinas also wrote a book on neo-liberal Mexico, secured a position with the Dow Jones Company in the United States, and worked as a professor at several prestigious universities in that country. Ernesto Zedillo and Felipe Calderón two surviving former presidents living in the United States and teaching at the universities where studied Zedillo at Yale University and Calderón at Harvard University. Along with Carlos Salinas de Gortari, three other surviving former presidents (Luis Echeverría, Vicente Fox, and Enrique Peña Nieto) still live in Mexico. On 30 June 2006, Echeverría was placed under house arrest under charges of genocide for his role as Secretary of the Interior during the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre. The house arrest was lifted in 2009.

It is an exhibition created entirely by artists and volunteers working together to share in the public space generously provided by the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation. Housed in a deserted army barracks, the fair exhibits the work of over 100 artists from around the world, working in all disciplines. The founders and organizers have established a hands-off curatorial environment, inviting the individual artists to create an experience of their own. This allows viewers an opportunity to see artwork – unrestrained by curatorial limitations – by some of the world's best independent artists in a beautiful, historic park setting. Until 2011, few outside of the military had ever visited Governors Island. Although this island lies only 800 yards from the southern tip of Manhattan it had remained relatively unknown. For almost two centuries Governors Island was a military base, home to the U.S. Army and the Coast Guard. On Jan. 31, 2003, the island was transferred to the people of New York and its increasing popularity as a cultural destination has reinvented the abandoned installation. Historic and full of potential, it is perhaps the last great expanse of undeveloped space for public use in New York City. GIAF 2008 GIAF 2008 was launched in September 2008 as a six weeks event and exhibited 50 artists. GIAF 2009 In 2009, GIAF is a four-week event September 5–27 exhibiting over 100 artists.

Treadwell is the former Chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission serving from 2006 to 2010. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a candidate for the 2014 U.S. Senate election in Alaska. Early life, education, and early career Treadwell was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Anne and Timothy Treadwell. He grew up in the Sandy Hook section of Newtown, Connecticut, where his father was the former first selectman of Newtown; the Timothy B. Treadwell Memorial Park named in his late father's honor. Treadwell attended Newtown Public Schools and attended Sandy Hook Elementary school. Treadwell attended high school at Newtown High School, and was then appointed by Senator Lowell Weicker as a Senate Page, attending the Senate Page School in DC. He then studied at the Hotchkiss School, in Lakeville, Connecticut, graduating in 1974 and was then accepted to Yale University. In 1978, Treadwell graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in History from Yale. Later that year, he moved to Alaska to take an internship with former U.S. Secretary of Interior Wally Hickel's campaign for Governor of Alaska. Hickel lost a close contest to incumbent Republican Governor Jay S. Hammond in the primary election, coming short by 98 votes out of over 100,000 votes cast. After controversy including multiple recounts and court challenges, Hickel launched a write-in campaign in the general election, besting three of the four candidates on the ballot, though once again losing to Hammond. Following the election, Treadwell became a political reporter for the Anchorage Times. He then returned to the contiguous United States where he attended Harvard University and graduated with his Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1982. After that, he was hired by Hickel's business company, Yukon Pacific Corporation, where he worked as Treasurer and later Vice President. Yukon Pacific was founded to investigate the possibility of building a trans-Alaska gas pipeline. Eventually Yukon Pacific was purchased by CSX in 1989. Early political career (1989-1994) In the wake of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, Treadwell left Yukon and went to Cordova, Alaska, to serve as the city's director of spill response. Cordova was badly impacted by the spill, which severely affected the area's fishing industry and disrupted the general ecology of the area. A September 1990 article in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal praised the cleanup efforts, saying that they had come along \\"quite well\\". Treadwell expressed optimism about the ecological rebound, cautioning that, while over half of beaches appeared normal and the quantity of commercial fish catches was exceptionally strong, the long-term effects of the spill would not be apparent for \\"years to come\\". In a 2006 piece on National Public Radio, Treadwell stated that some harmful effects of the oil spill have persisted. Treadwell helped establish the Siberia Alaska Gateway Project of the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce, which worked to open the US- Russia border with the Friendship Flight. He led two expeditions to Wrangel Island in 1990 and led a team of nuclear safety experts to the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant in Chukotka in 1993. He hosted RADEX, the Arctic nations’ first circumpolar radiation release response exercise in 1994. In 1990, incumbent one-term governor Steve Cowper decided not to seek re-election. Hickel decided to run as the nominee of the Alaskan Independence Party, and won with a plurality of 39% of the vote.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=24135 Hickel appointed Treadwell served as Deputy Commissioner of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation. He served in that position from 1991 to 1994 and continued to help the cleanup of the spill. He wrote new oil spill prevention laws, and helped create the Department's Environmental Justice division. He also represented the state of Alaska on U.S. delegations in three circumpolar government groups: the eight-nation Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, the Arctic Council, and the regional Governors’ Northern Forum. He joined Governor Hickel at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. After Governor Hickel decided not to run for re-election in 1994, Treadwell served as a board member on the Alaska Science and Technology Foundation. He is a member of the Alaska Siberia Research Center board. Treadwell was elected a Fellow National of the Explorers Club in 2002 and chairs the North Pacific Alaska Chapter of the Club. Business career Treadwell has been involved in numerous successful business ventures and is a prominent member of Alaska's business community.

His father moved to Warsaw from Slovakia, supposedly because of \\"political reasons\\" (at the time Slovakia was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire) and married a Polish woman, Helena Perzanowska. September campaign In September 1939, after the Nazi invasion of Poland, together with his father Stanisław, he took part in the defense of Warsaw in the ranks of the Czech and Slovak Volunteer Legion. After his father died in this battle, Mirosław took the conspiratorial name \\"Stanko\\" in honor of his father. Joining the resistance At the beginning of 1943, together with Adam Chalupec, Mirosław Iringh organized the \\"Underground Slovak National Committee\\" (SKN), which made contact with the representatives of the Home Army, and established civilian and military relations.\\"Udział Słowaków w Powstaniu Warszawskim\\" (The Participation of Slovaks in the Warsaw Uprising), Polonus, At the end of 1943 an agreement was reached between the SKN and the Home Army command, which called for the formation of a separate Slovak military unit within the structure of the Home Army - Platoon 535. The unit was to be distinguished by armbands and a regimental standard in Slovak national colors, white-blue-red, as opposed to the red and white colors of the rest of the Home Army soldiers. Iringh's armband was made by the wife of one of the Polish members of SKN, Jadwiga Szantarek-Szczudłowska. She sewed it out of a French broad riband military decoration which had been bestowed on her husband (Col. Mieczysław Szczudłowski) by Marshal Foch - the colors of the French flag are the same as that of the Slovak one. Because of the similarity in colors, during the Warsaw Uprising, the civilians of Warsaw sometimes mistook the Slovak partisans for Frenchmen. During the Nazi occupation Iringh held a Slovak passport which allowed him certain \\"privileges\\" unavailable to Poles, which he used for anti- Nazi underground activity. For example, he was allowed to own a radio (ownership of these by Poles was illegal) which he used to monitor Allied news reports from the West which he then used as basis for articles in the underground newspapers. The Slovak passport also saved him from being taken in so called Łapankas (street round up), which made him a natural choice for a smuggler and distributor of the Bibula (Polish underground press). According to the memoirs of his wife, Waleria (who was also active in the underground) on one occasion the Łapanka took place on a tram, while Iringh was carrying a brief case full of illegal newspapers. Iringh approached the German policeman in charge and stated that he was a foreigner and in turn he was asked for his documents. Mirosław handed the suitcase full of illegal contraband to the policeman and calmly looked for his passport. Once he had produced it, the suitcase was handed back and he was free to leave. Iringh also prepared anti- Nazi pamphlets in Slovak which were distributed to the Slovak communities in Warsaw and Lwow, as well as to Hungarian soldiers stationed in Warsaw, who although serving as allies of Germany were often quite sympathetic to the Polish resistance (and many of whom were of Slovak background). Iringh was also a photographer of the fighting and civilian everyday life during the insurrection. Many of his photographs are part of the collection of the National Library of Poland. Before the war, Iringh was a journalist, a profession which he tried to resume after the war.Władysław Jewsiewicki, \\"Powstanie warszawskie 1944: okiem polskiej kamery\\" (Warsaw Uprising 1944: through the eyes of Polish camera), Interpress, 1989, pg. 72, He wrote for the newspapers Život (the newspaper of the Slovakian Community in Poland, which Iringh helped to organize),Jan Spernoga, Zivot, \\"550 cislot Zivota\\" Gazeta Lubelska, and Życie Warszawy. Warsaw Uprising and Platoon 535 The \\"Slovak Platoon\\" in 1944 (photo by Maria Budzanowska). Note the Slovak flag and armbands. During the Warsaw Uprising Mirosław led his platoon in heavy fighting in the Czernakow district (although some soldiers of the platoon got trapped in other parts of Warsaw and were unable to join the main group - instead they fought independently in Praga). Iringh's unit was strengthened by a number of foreign, non-Slovak, soldiers who were present in Warsaw and who also wanted to fight the Germans, and additionally by several escaped Soviet POWs. According to the memoirs of former platoon members, Iringh was a commander noted for his frankness and directness, he always looked serious and never made jokes, which enabled him to enforce strict discipline in his unit. At the same time he cared greatly for his soldiers, took part in direct fighting himself, even though at the time he was sick with pneumonia. One of the AK nurses assigned to his unit, Danuta Pietraszak (now Michałowska) remembers him as \\"Emaciated, in a hard hat instead of a helmet, always with a cigarette, constantly coughing. He was in control of everyone, even our Georgians\\" (the last being a reference to the escaped Soviet POWs who were part of the unit). After the war He was persecuted by communist authorities for having been a member of the AK and was refused employment for many years. Initially he worked as a freelance writer for various newspapers. However, in 1951 he lost his job due to his past membership in the Home Army. His wife was given a choice of either divorcing him, or also losing her job. She refused, and they both became unemployed. As a result, Iringh tried to support his family, even though by this time he was quite ill, by taking photographs and selling them on the street to passers-by. In 1956 he started to work for the Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland although he was soon once again fired on the basis of an absurd accusation that he was plotting to separate the Orava and Polish Spisz regions from Poland and join them to Czechoslovakia. He died of lung cancer in 1985, and he is buried in the Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. Remembrance Portion of the exhibit dedicated to Platoon 535 led by Mirosław Iringh at the Warsaw Uprising Museum In June 2005, Mirosław Iringh's daughters transferred a collection of memorabilia about Iringh and Platoon 535 to the Warsaw Uprising Museum in Warsaw where they are currently on display. On 31 August 2007 Iringh's daughter, Bogusława Iringh–Nagórska, accepted in her father's name the decoration of the Order of Ľudovít Štúr (Rád Ľudovíta Štúra), second class, bestowed upon him posthumously by the President of Slovakia Ivan Gašparovič.

Biography solidus of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641). Bonus was one of his closest and most trusted aides, and served as effective regent of the Byzantine Empire during Heraclius's absences on campaign after 622 and until his death. Almost nothing is known of Bonus's origins or private life. In a panegyric poem dedicated to Bonus in 626, George Pisides calls him a \\"companion in arms\\" of Heraclius, possibly implying that Bonus accompanied him when he sailed from Africa in 610 to overthrow Emperor Phocas (r. 602–610). He is also known to have had an illegitimate son, John, who was sent as a hostage to the Avars in 622.. At this time, the Byzantine Empire was engaged in a prolonged struggle with its large eastern antagonist, the Sassanid Persian Empire. Over the previous twenty years, Persian armies had scored victory after victory and captured most of the Byzantine Levant. In 622, after securing peace with the Avars in the Balkans, Heraclius set out to campaign in person against the Persians. Bonus was left behind in Constantinople as the Emperor's deputy and guardian of his young sons, together with Patriarch Sergius.. During Heraclius's absence on campaign for the next years, Bonus acted as the effective regent of the Byzantine Empire.. The exact offices Bonus held are unclear; he held the rank of patrikios, and in the sources he is usually simply referred to as \\"the magistros\\". Although this would usually imply the position of magister officiorum, Theodore Synkellos calls him \\"the general\\" (strategos), possibly implying that he held the post of magister militum praesentalis.. Modern scholarly opinion is divided between the two cases; thus the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire and Walter Kaegi support the latter thesis, while John Haldon notably supports the former.. By 626, Heraclius had scored several victories in the East and reversed the strategic situation in his favour, but the Persian general Shahrbaraz was still encamped with his army in western Asia Minor, close to Constantinople. At this juncture, the Persians came to an understanding with the Avars, raising the prospect of a combined siege of Constantinople. To that end, the Persians advanced, took and razed Chalcedon, opposite side to Constantinople with regard to the Bosporus, and awaited the arrival of the Avars.. Emperor Heraclius, having learned of the threat to his capital, decided not to return in person; instead, he sent advice and reinforcements to Bonus, who proceeded to strengthen the city walls and gather provisions.. The Avar army arrived in front of the city of Constantinople in July 626. Proposals for a surrender by the Avar khagan were rejected by Bonus, and the siege began on July 29. Bonus was the overall commander of the defenders. During the first five days of the siege, he sent repeated embassies to try to persuade the khagan to withdraw, offering money in return... On the fifth day, the Byzantine envoys encountered a Persian embassy in the khagan’s tent, a fact that underscored the danger the city would be in if the Avars' Slavic allies managed to ferry the Persian army over the Bosporus strait. Thus, on the tenth day of the siege, August 7, as the Avar assault peaked, Bonus lured the Slavs into a trap: the Byzantines had learned that the signal for the Slavic fleet to cross the strait and rendezvous with the Persian forces in Chalcedon would be the lighting of a great bonfire. Therefore, the Byzantines themselves lit a beacon in Blachernae, and as the Slavs made the crossing, the Byzantine fleet, standing by inside the Golden Horn, sallied forth and decisively defeated them.. Following this success and the repulsion of the Avars from the walls, Bonus had to restrain the over-eager people of the city, including women and children, who wanted to rush out and capture the enemy siege engines.. Instead, on August 8, the Avars began withdrawing; Bonus, Patriarch Sergius, and many people came to the Golden Gate to watch their retreat and the burning of the siege towers, set on fire by the Avars themselves. The Emperor's brother, Theodore, arrived soon after at the head of an army, and took up the running of affairs in the capital. Shortly after this, in early May 627, Bonus died and was buried (on May 11) in the Monastery of St John of Stoudios.. Cistern of Bonus Bonus also built a large cistern in the city (Greek: ), covered with a domed roof, close to the site of his own house. It lay to the northeast of the Church of the Holy Apostles, in the coolest part of the city. For that reason, Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944) built a palace there, the \\"New Palace of Bonus\\".. Theophano, the first wife of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), also built a church nearby, St. Constantine of the Cistern of Bonus, where her body was eventually transferred, probably after the sack of the city in 1204.. This palace complex played a central role in the annual ritual commemoration of Constantine the Great, the city's founder, on May 21, with the imperial family moving from the palace to Constantine's mausoleum in the Holy Apostles and back again..

The equipment is designed to improve command execution, target acquisition and situational awareness by: * Providing communications, command and control at the soldier level * Integrating small arms with high-tech equipment * Promoting a view of the individual soldier as a system rather than as a segment of a larger force * Providing different variants for low level commanders, assaulters and supporters Background Canada's desire for a Soldier System dates back to November 1988 and closely follows efforts in many NATO countries. The first research effort, called Integrated Protective Clothing and Equipment (IPCE), was initiated in 1995, but then was cancelled due to its high cost and its failure to meet the majority of requirements. Ongoing operations in the mid 1990s led to the creation of the Clothe the Soldier (CTS) Project, which directly addressed the NATO Soldier System Capability areas of Survivability and Sustainability. The Canadian Disruptive Pattern was implemented during the Clothe Soldier Project (CTS). Integrated Soldier System Project The Integrated Soldier System Project (ISSP) is intended to provide an integrated suite of equipment that may include weapons and electronic devices. The $310 million project program will provide the Canadian Army with new equipment, not only to allow troops to track each other as they move throughout the battlefield, but to feed communication and targeting information to their Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) systems. The project is expected to unfold over the next ten years. The Department of National Defence confirmed that approximately 17,000 integrated soldier systems would be bought by 2011. The ISSP will address the remaining NATO Soldier System capabilities of Lethality, Mobility and Survivability, while balancing the baseline needs. Small Arms Replacement Project In October 2007, the Department of National Defence approved the Small Arms Replacement Project II (SARP II), which will deliver integrated, direct fire, multi-effect, portable anti- personnel and anti-material capability through weapons, munitions, fire control systems, training systems and logistic support. The cost for SARP II exceeds $1 Billion for the 2012-2022 period.

Waterman (March 4, 1808 – August 8, 1884), known as Bully Waterman or Bully Bob Waterman, was an American merchant sea captain. He set three sailing speed records; his time of 74 days from Hong Kong to New York City has never been bettered in a sail-powered vessel. He was reputed as a martinet, and was once convicted of assault against a crewman in a controversial California criminal case. Early career Waterman was born in Hudson, New York, the son of a Nantucket whaling captain. His father died at sea when the boy was eight, and the family moved to Fairfield, Connecticut. Waterman first went to sea at age 12 aboard a China trader, and spent most of the next nine years aboard transatlantic packet ships. By 1829, at the age of 21, he had been promoted to first mate of the Black Ball packet Britannia. His captain aboard the Britannia, Charles H. Marshall, later bought the packet South America and made Waterman the skipper. It was Waterman's first command.Whipple 1981, pp. 31, 34. In 1836, Waterman accepted command of the cotton freighter Natchez, owned by Howland & Aspinwall, a Manhattan merchant company. He guided the Natchez on several voyages around Cape Horn to Valparaiso. In 1842, Howland & Aspinwall switched the Natchez to the China trade, and Waterman sailed her to Macao. His return trip from Macao to New York took only 78 days, a new record.Whipple 1981, p. 30. Captain of the Sea Witch During the late 1840s, Howland & Aspinwall gave Waterman command of the clipper Sea Witch. Waterman worked with the ship's designer, John W. Griffiths, designing much of the Sea Witch's rig and sail plan, specifying masts and more square footage of sail than a 74-gun warship.Whipple 1981, p. 31. In 1847, he brought the Sea Witch from Hong Kong to New York in 77 days, beating his previous record by a day. In 1849, Waterman set his final record for the Hong Kong–New York trip. Leaving New York on April 27, 1848, he went to China by the unusual route of Cape Horn (most China clippers traveled by way of the Cape of Good Hope). Loading a cargo of tea at Hong Kong, Waterman took the Sea Witch out of harbor on January 9, 1849. Spending much of the voyage under full sail, he started the Sea Witchs return voyage via the Sunda Strait, often covering over per day and once reaching . He reached the Cape of Good Hope February 16, logging a run for the day, his best of the voyage.Whipple 1981, pp. 34, 36, 41. Waterman reached New York on March 25, a 74-day passage. Neither he nor any other captain of a sail-powered vessel would ever break this record.Whipple 1981, pp. 18, 20. Voyage of the Challenge Handsomely rewarded by Howland & Aspinwall for his unequaled performance aboard the Sea Witch, Waterman briefly retired from seafaring. However, the N. L. & G. Griswold shipping company was seeking a high-quality captain for its new clipper Challenge, offering him a $10,000 bonus if he could get the ship to San Francisco within 90 days of departure. Waterman accepted the Challenge, and took her out of New York on July 13, 1851. That very first day, Waterman quarreled with and dismissed his first mate, and replaced him with James Douglass, hired off the deck of a packet at Sandy Hook.Whipple 1981, pp. 81, 86. Challenge, 1851 clipper Unfortunately for all concerned, N. L. & G. Griswold had failed to provide Challenge with an experienced crew; the huge demand for sailors occasioned by clippers sailing for the California gold fields had left few competent seamen in New York. Half of the ship's 56-man complement had never sailed, and only three were able seamen; many were recent immigrants who could speak no English. Discipline, morale, and seamanship were predictably poor.Whipple 1981, p. 90. Waterman used considerable violence against this crew, personally slashing the cook's scalp with a carving knife, and beating at least two sick sailors for working too slowly.Whipple 1981, pp. 83, 94. However, the focus of the crew's resentment was the new first mate Douglass, who dealt blows abundantly and with relish. As the Challenge neared Rio de Janeiro, several crewmen conspired to kill Douglass, inflicting 12 knife wounds on him. Waterman waded into the fray and saved Douglass, then personally flogged the mutineers.Whipple 1981, pp. 90-91. The U.S. Congress had outlawed flogging aboard merchant vessels in 1850, but the prohibition was routinely violated, especially aboard the hard-driven clipper ships.Whipple 1981, p. 92. After rounding Cape Horn, Waterman discovered another of the mutineers who had been hiding in the forecastle, had him dragged on deck, and broke his arm with a club, then had him shackled in the sick bay by the fractured limb.Whipple 1981, p. 95. Most of the violence that Waterman personally inflicted was directed at the mutineers who had tried to kill Douglass. However, Douglass himself continued to abuse the crew intensely, with Waterman doing little to restrain him and occasionally encouraging him.Whipple 1981, pp. 93-95. When the Challenge reached San Francisco after a 108-day passage, the crew's version of events aboard created an uproar in the city. One newspaper called for Waterman to be \\"burned alive,\\" and he narrowly escaped lynching. Waterman defiantly had eight of the alleged mutineers arrested, but only one was tried, and that one was acquitted. Waterman and Douglass themselves stood trial for their conduct aboard the Challenge. Waterman was convicted by a jury for beating one of the sick crewmen, but the judge refused to sentence him. Douglass was convicted of murder for beating a crewman to death, and for assault on another crewman, but no sentence is recorded, and he is known to have been released soon afterward, never again to serve aboard a merchantman.Whipple 1981, pp. 98-100. \\"The Challenge cases ... were the first 'hellship' trials, and by the very fact that they did occur, they made possible, many years later, the freedom of the American merchant sailor from the tyranny of masters and mates,\\" paving the way for the Seamen's Act of 1915. \\"Seagoing-labor litigation and cases relating to the defense of seamen's rights were heard by district courts with coastal jurisdiction, such as those in San Francisco and Honolulu ... the first 21 criminal cases [of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California] were connected with the murder or mistreatment of seamen by Captain \\"Bully\\" Waterman and other officers of the clipper ship Challenge.\\" Retirement Waterman retired from the sea after leaving the Challenge and settled in California with his wife. There he founded the city of Fairfield in 1856, named after his former home in Connecticut. He raised poultry and cattle, and served as San Francisco's Port Warden and Inspector of Hulls.Whipple 1981, p. 100. He died in 1884. See also *Carrier Pigeon, salvage operation by Capt.

View of Saint Peter Port from Victoria Tower History As the 1846 royal visit was the first time a reigning monarch had ever visited the island, a small granite stone was laid to mark where the queen had first stepped ashore in St Peter Port harbour. The following year, the architect William Colling was asked to draw up plans for a tower to commemorate the monarch's visit. The site chosen for Victoria Tower was an earthen mound opposite the Arsenal, where Guernsey's militia were housed. On 27 May 1848 the first foundation stone was laid by the Governor of Guernsey, Major General John Bell, during a large ceremony. In the foundations of the tower was a time capsule containing Guernsey and English coins. On 14 August 1859 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the island again and after an island tour came to inspect the tower. In 1999 structural problems led to the tower's being closed to the general public; it was re- opened on 24 May 2006, the birthday of Queen Victoria, during a re-enactment of the ceremony accompanying the laying of the foundation stone in 1848. The Lieutenant Governor, Vice Admiral Sir Fabian Malbon KBE, re-opened the tower in the presence of the Bailiff Geoffrey Rowland.  Surrounding area  The tower is next to the Town Arsenal, originally built to house the artillery for the Royal Guernsey Militia, currently used by the Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service A public garden around the tower was later created, in which were placed two cannons captured from the Russians during the Crimean War these now sit on the ramparts of Castle Cornet. Years later, other guns were displayed in the garden, including four 13.5 cm K 09 German guns, two of these were scrapped in 1938, with the remaining two buried as the Second World War approached in 1940, so that the invading German forces would think the island was not fortified. The two German guns that were buried were excavated in 1978 and are back on display in the garden.

He is a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre and resident guest artist at The Australian Ballet, and formerly a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet. In 2021 he will take over as artistic director of The Australian Ballet. Early life Hallberg was born in Rapid City, South Dakota, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was inspired to dance when he saw a Fred Astaire film in the family living room. With his family's support, he trained at the Ballet Arizona School under the direction of Kee Juan Han. In 1999 he studied for one year at the Paris Opera Ballet School, then joined American Ballet Theatre's Studio Company in 2000. Career Hallberg joined ABT's corps de ballet in 2001, was promoted to Soloist in 2004, then Principal in 2006.

In 2011 Hallberg became the first American to become a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet. Hallberg was invited by Sergei Filin, Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director to join as either a guest artist or principal. Part of his decision to join was made, in part, to dance with ballerina Natalia Osipova with whom he had danced previously. However, owing to a severe ankle injury, he did not perform with the Bolshoi after July 2014, and the association ended formally in 2017. During two years off stage due to complications recovering from surgery on his left foot, Hallberg spent 15 months working with The Australian Ballet's physiotherapy and rehabilitation team, building a relationship with the company that resulted in his being named Resident Guest Artist. He finally returned to the stage in a role début, that of Franz in Coppélia, with The Australian Ballet and partnered with Amber Scott in December 2016. Hallberg starred in the 2017 Nike campaign, \\"I, David\\", directed by Niclas Gillis with set design by James Casebere.

It was founded in October 2008 by Donald Bryant and is the first volunteer organization in the State of Ohio to be granted special administrative powers by a city Mayor. In a ceremony at Malabar Middle School in May 2009, Mayor Donald Culliver officially introduced the Education Task Force as the first member of his volunteer services office. The mission of the Mayor's Education Task Force is geared to \\"Help Create a Positive Learning Environment\\" in the Mansfield Public City School system and is a community/citywide operation with offices located at Malabar Middle School, Mansfield Senior High School and a central downtown office at the Mayor's Office.  History  The Mayor's Education Task Force was founded created in October 2008 in a response to the district's academic emergency status and low community support for the Mansfield City Public School system. Mansfield Mayor Donald Culliver called the community into action asking for a partnership formation with his administration to help raise academic standards. He delegated the activity of forming an education group to his intern assistant from The Ohio State University Donald Bryant. In November 2008, Bryant began asking the Mansfield community for support but was heavily criticized for lack of management and education experience while Mayor Culliver faced challenges from political rivals. However, in January 2009, the Mayor's Education Task Force officially hit the ground running and gained key support from community members, churches and City Council member Patricia Hightower. In February 2009, the Mayor's Education Task Force earned support from the 42nd President of the United States, President Bill Clinton in Austin, Texas at the Clinton Global Initiative University Conference,stating a goal of getting elected officials involved in the education system.

As of April 2009, USA Federal Credit Union had over $600 million USD in assets, and over 61,000 members. USA Fed was one of 19 credit unions based in San Diego, California. History USA Federal Credit Union began in November 1953 with ten members as N.T.C. San Diego Employees Federal Credit Union. The employee- organized federal credit union was initially formed to serve the civilian employees of the Naval Training Center San Diego. In 1955, all military personnel working at N.T.C. were added to the field of membership. As the credit union grew, the field of membership expanded internationally allowing for USA Fed's presence in the Pacific Rim. From 2004 until 2007, the credit union marketed itself as USA Federal, unveiling a unified brand image across printed collateral materials and their online presence. In 2008, the credit union began promoting the use of the shortened name USA Fed. On March 26, 2010, USA Fed announced to members that their official web site address would be changing to usafed.org. On September 22, 2010, USA Fed announced plans to merge with Navy Federal Credit Union, stating that joint operations would begin October 4, 2010 under the Navy Federal banner. Membership USA Fed's field of membership was set by the NCUA. As with all credit unions, membership in USA Federal is limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. Membership in USA Fed is limited to: * All Department of Defense (DoD) uniformed personnel — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, retirees and annuitants * All Department of Defense reservists — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, — regardless of drill status — retirees and annuitants * All Army and Air National Guard personnel — regardless of drill status — civilian employees, retirees and annuitants * All DoD Officer Candidate programs: midshipmen and cadets at the United States Naval Academy, United States Military Academy, United States Air Force Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy and the United States Merchant Marine Academy; personnel in Officer Candidate programs * All DoD civilian employees * U.S. government employees assigned to DoD installations * DoD contractors assigned to U.S. government installations * Select Employee Groups (SEGs) * Family members, including grandparents, parents, spouses, siblings, grandchildren, children (including adopted, foster and stepchildren) and household members Organization USA Fed was chartered with NCUA. Like all credit unions, USA Fed was governed by a board of volunteers, elected by and from its membership. Services USA Fed offered the typical suite of account services offered by most financial institutions, including savings accounts, checking accounts, IRA accounts, and certificates. The savings product is named \\"Share Savings\\" to reflect the fact that a member's initial savings deposit ($5) literally represents their share of ownership in the credit union. USA Fed also offers members consumer loans, credit cards, mortgages and home equity lines of credit, as well as some small business services. USA Fed's Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO), CUSO Financial Services, L.P. (CFS), offers more extensive investment services, online brokerage services, and insurance. By June 30, 2010, USA Fed closed their Las Vegas, Nevada branch, one of several inherited from another credit union they absorbed years ago, bringing the total branched to 19. As of March 9, 2009, USA Fed has 20 branches and 23 ATMs, located both inside the United States (California and Nevada) and abroad (Japan and Korea). Scholarship programs In 1987, the Board of Directors at USA Federal established a Student Scholarship Program awarding five scholarships to college-bound high school seniors. In 2001, following the untimely death of the USA Federal CEO, the Board renamed the Scholarship Program the Martin P. Cassell Scholarship Program in his honor. In 2006, the Board of Directors established The CDR Timothy R. McMaster, USN, Scholarship Program in memoriam of a distinguished Board Member who provided 22 years (1984–2006) of volunteer service to USA Federal Credit Union. One scholarship will be awarded to a college-bound high school senior who is the child of an active duty military member. Community involvement USA Fed was a long-time supporter of San Diego Fleet Week, where Director of Military Affairs and former prisoner-of-war, Jim Bedinger, has served in several officer positions, including Treasurer for the San Diego Fleet Week Foundation.http://www.fleetweeksandiego.org/news/bios/jimbedinger.pdf Since 2004, USA Fed has been a sponsor of Walk on the Wild Side, an event benefiting the San Diego Zoo.

The principle states that the influence lines of an action (force or moment) assumes the scaled form of the deflection displacement. OR, This principle states that \\"ordinate of ILD for a reactive force is given by ordinate of elastic curve if a unit deflection is applied in the direction of reactive force.\\" This method is one of the easiest way to draw the influence lines.  Example of using the Müller-Breslau principle to find qualitative influence lines  right Part (a) of the figure to the right shows a simply supported beam with a unit load traveling across it. The structure is statically determinate. Therefore, all influence lines will be straight lines. Parts (b) and (c) of the figure shows the influence lines for the reactions in the y-direction. Releasing the vertical reaction for A allows the beam to rotate to Δ. Likewise for part (c). Δ is typically taken as positive upwards. Part (d) of the figure shows the influence line for shear at point B. Using the beam sign convention and cutting the beam at B, we can deduce the figure shown. Part (e) of the figure shows the influence line for the bending moment at point B. Again making a cut through the beam at point B and using the beam sign convention, we can deduce the figure shown. The procedure for applying the Muller-Breslau principle is as follows: # Remove the constraint at the point of interest for the function of interest. This means if the influence line for a reaction is asked for simply start by pretending the beam is no longer attached to the reaction in question and is free to rotate about the other support. If the influence line for a moment is desired, pretend the point in question is a hinge and the subsequent two sides can rotate about their supports. If the influence line for shear is desired, again pretend the point in question is a shear release, again where both sides can rotate about their supports. # Consider the remaining portion of the beam to have infinite rigidity, so it is a straight line free to rotate about the support. #Lastly rotate whatever is free to rotate in its positive direction, but only enough to create a deflection of 1 unit total. This means if the moment IL is in question and an imaginary hinge is splitting the beam in two pieces, the two angles created between each rotated side and the original beam must add to equal 1. Similarly if the shear IL is in question the two sides will have opposite directions of rotation. So at the shear release the right side will typically be rotated upwards and the left side will be rotated downward, as this is the sign convention for shear. The total displacement between the two sides of the shear release must equal to 1.

He maintained that the logo, introduced in 1969, was not inspired by Harmon Killebrew, but rather \\"pure design\\" with reference to several photographs. Former colleague Alan Siegel, the designer of the National Basketball Association logo, based his work on Dior's design and a photograph of Jerry West.

Biography   Life and career  Danese was born in Hartsdale, New York. She was the 1970 Miss Pennsylvania World. Her acting career began in 1975 playing the part of Kitty in an episode of the TV series Medical Story (credited as Sherry Danese). She subsequently guest-starred in other TV series during the 1970s, with appearances in One Day at a Time, Serpico, Baretta, Three's Company, Kojak, Family, Hart to Hart, Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels. In one of her few roles on the big screen, Danese starred with Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business (1983), playing a prostitute named Vicki. In 2005, she appeared alongside her husband Peter Falk in the movie Checking Out.  Columbo (1976–1997)  Danese had major supporting roles in six episodes of the TV series Columbo, appearing alongside her husband (who played the detective Columbo) in Fade in to Murder (1976), Murder Under Glass (1978), Murder, a Self Portrait (1989), Columbo and the Murder of a Rock Star (1991), Undercover (1994) and A Trace of Murder (1997). Although she played the killer only once, Danese has the distinction of having acted in more episodes of the series than any other actress.  Personal life  Danese met Peter Falk on the set of the movie Mikey and Nicky and became his second wife on December 7, 1977. They were married for 33 years until Falk's death on June 23, 2011 at age 83 from complications of Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia. Danese was Falk's conservator, and allegedly, according to his daughter Catherine, stopped some of his family members from visiting him, did not notify them of major changes in his condition, and did not notify them of his death and funeral arrangements. Catherine later encouraged the passage of legislation called Peter Falk's Law, that provides guidelines that guardians and conservators for an incapacitated person must comply with regarding visitation rights and notice of death.https://www.esslawfirm.com/Articles/Peter-Falk-s-Law-Becomes-a-Reality- in-New-York.shtml As of 2016 over ten states had enacted such laws.https://www.hackardlaw.com/blog/2018/08/peter-falk-columbos-estate- dispute.shtml References  External links  * Category:American film actresses Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American actresses Category:People from Hartsdale, New York Category:American television actresses Category:Actresses from New York (state) ","title":"Shera Danese"},{"id":"24357484","text":"Henry II Reuss, Count of Gera Musikalische Exequien (Funeral music), Op. 7, SWV 279–281 is a sacred composition by Heinrich Schütz, dating from . Written for the funeral services of Count Henry II, Count of Reuss-Gera, who had died on 3 December 1635, it is Schütz's most famous work of funeral music. It comprises the following sections: :I Concert in Form einer teutschen Begräbnis-Messe :II Motet Herr, wenn ich nur Dich habe :III Canticum B. Simeonis Herr, nun lässest du deinen Diener Henry II had planned the service himself and chosen the texts, some of which are scriptural and others of which are from 16th-century Lutheran writers, including Martin Luther himself. He also commissioned Schütz to compose the music on the occasion of his death. Part I, by far the longest part of the work, is scored for SSATTB (2 sopranos, alto, 2 tenors, bass) chorus alternating with small ensembles of soloists. Part II is scored for double choir SATB SATB, and part III for SATTB choir and a trio of soloists. All movements are accompanied by basso continuo. The work was not well known to Brahms, though his German Requiem is remarkably similar in content. The work was the first requiem in the German language.

Wrede. It was first published in hardcover by Harcourt Brace in 1996, and was subsequently issued in paperback by Point Fantasy in 1998 and in trade paperback by Magic Carpet Books in 2005. Five of the stories had appeared previously in the anthologies Liavek: The Players of Luck (Ace Books, 1986), edited by Will Shetterly and Emma Bull, The Unicorn Treasury (Doubleday, 1988), edited by Bruce Coville, Tales of the Witch World 3 (Tor Books, 1990), edited by Andre Norton, A Wizard’s Dozen (Harcourt Brace, 1993), edited by Michael Stearns, and Black Thorn, White Rose (Morrow AvoNova, 1994), edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling. The book collects ten fantasy stories by Wrede, together with a recipe associated with one of the stories and notes by the author concerning the inspiration of some of the stories. Two of the tales are set in the shared worlds of Will Shetterley and Emma Bull's Liavek (\\"Rikiki and the Wizard\\") and Andre Norton's Witch World (\\"The Sword-Seller\\"). Two stories (\\"The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn\\" and \\"Utensile Strength\\") are set in the world of Wrede's own Enchanted Forest Chronicles. Two (\\"Stronger than Time\\" and \\"The Lorelei\\") are retellings, or alternate versions of traditional fairy or folk tales. One (\\"Cruel Sisters\\") is based on a folk song, a variant of The Twa Sisters, that Wrede once heard performed by Loreena McKennitt as The Bonny Swans. McKennitt's change to a particular line (\\"and he had daughters, one, two three...\\") inspired Wrede to write the story from the third daughter's point of view. Contents *\\"Rikiki and the Wizard\\" A story about a successful wizard, who, seeking everlasting fame and wealth, offers his beautiful daughter in marriage to whichever god helps him achieve his goal. The god who answers is a blue chipmunk named Rikiki. Rikiki only wants to eats nuts, and while the wizard has no patience for him, his daughter feeds him some chestnuts. Rikiki, in gratitude for the daughter's kindness, gives her the ability to produce gold chestnuts from the empty chestnut bag. He also agrees to make the wizard famous forever. The gold chestnuts turn into real chestnuts when the wizard picks them up, as does everything else he touches. He soon becomes a laughingstock, unable to live down his reputation. *\\"The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn\\" Princess Elyssa's happy home life (i.e., a kind father, loving stepmother, and friendly stepsisters) is constantly disrupted by the King's councilors, who feel that things should be more traditional. The stepsisters should be jealous of each other, the stepmother biased and cruel. In order to annoy the councilors who make her life so difficult, Elyssa runs away (with her family's blessing) to seek her fortune by disguising herself as a maid in the castle of her stepmother's friend Queen Hildegard. On her journey she falls in with a talking cat, who leads her into the Enchanted Forest, claiming that Queen Hildegard is bossy and unpleasant. Elyssa is annoyed but decides to make the best of it. She comes across a pool of water but is prevented from drinking by the unicorn who guards it. Although the unicorn is angry at first, when he discovers Elyssa is a princess he wants her to stay with him and pamper him. When Elyssa refuses to stay in the clearing admiring the unicorn's beauty and making garlands for him to wear, the unicorn becomes angry and holds her there by magic. Although Elyssa walks away, she ends up back by the unicorn's pool. Ultimately she is able to escape by walking with her hand on the cat's back. The cat seems weakened by their escape and in her distress Elyssa kisses him on the nose. He turns into a handsome prince and explains that he was changed into a cat by Queen Hildegard when he refused to marry her daughter. Elyssa claims that he doesn't have to marry her just because it is traditional, but the prince says that he likes the idea of marrying Elyssa quite a lot. Elyssa likes the idea herself, so they get married and live happily ever after. *\\"Roses by Moonlight\\" A young woman named Adrian is bitter and jealous of her younger sister, Sam's, success, popularity, and looks. While avoiding Sam's party, she meets a woman who takes her to a garden of roses. Each rose contains a possible future for Adrian, success in work, love, failure, death, or continued bitterness against her sister. She finds one flower, only a bud, that shows her and Sam agreeing to work harder to get along. She is told she may pick just one flower, but she decides to forgo the garden and chose her own future. The woman and her garden vanish, and Adrian, still not wanting to go back to Sam's party, decides that there will always be time to talk to Sam tomorrow. *\\"The Sixty-two Curses of Caliph Arenschadd\\" The Caliph is a magician as well as a ruler, and notoriously quick-tempered. Rather than allow his occasional ire against those who serve him result in irreparable fatalities, he has devised a list of curses to serve in place of execution; the victims must figure out how to break the curses on their own. The Caliph's most-cursed servant is his long-suffering vizier, who has gotten further down the list than anyone else. To add insult to injury, when he is cursed, his whole family is cursed with him. The vizier's daughter narrates the result of the latest curse, which bids fair to be the worst of all—lycanthropy, for which there is no known cure. A nightly run by the light of the full moon is all well and good, but what will happen when she or her parents end up biting someone? Fortunately her best friend, a lad about the palace, comes up with a brilliant solution. *\\"Earthwitch\\" A king named Evan Rydingsword, whose land is threatened by a powerful enemy and torn apart by war, goes to ask the powerful Earthwitch, a person who channels the raw power of the Earth, for help. He arrives to discover that it is his old lover, Mariel, not a crone as he expected. Mariel left him 14 years ago because his ambition overpowered her, and she has served almost all of her seven-year term as the Earthwitch. Evan is proud, but years of war and leadership have made him a better man than he was, and he offers his life to the Earth in exchange for help for his people. The Earth complies, and causes the ground to open beneath his enemies and swallow them up. The price the Earth then demands of Evan is Mariel's life. He feels his sword pulling toward her, and rather than kill her, cuts off his own hand with his dagger. He awakes blind and crippled. Mariel tells him that he is no longer king, although his people defeated their enemy. He will be the Earthwitch after her, but once he has served his seven-year term, they may be able to be together, as \\"just Evan and Mariel,\\" without any politics, power, or ambition to tear them apart. *\\"The Sword-Seller\\" *\\"The Lorelei\\" The Lorelei is a retelling of the Scottish ballad Tam Lin. Janet, an American student, is on a school trip in Germany. Mechanical trouble with the tour bus forces the class to stay at a hotel on high cliffs overlooking the Rhine. Legend has it that the Lorelei, a Siren-like woman, used to sing from the cliffs and lure sailors to their doom on the rocks. Janet is unnerved by a statue of the Lorelei, and as the day wears on she becomes convinced that one of her male classmates is missing. However, since she is unable to prove her suspicions, Janet walks out to the cliffs where she hears faint music growing louder. She comes face to face with the Lorelei, who has taken someone from Janet's class, a boy named Dan. The Lorelei has been toying with Dan, allowing him to escape nearly to the road before calling him back to the cliffs with her singing. Janet covers Dan's ears which frees him from the Lorelei's power. When the Lorelei begins to ensnare Janet, Dan covers her ears, allowing them to break her power over them. The Lorelei commends Janet for her strength, and lets Janet and Dan return to the hotel. *\\"Stronger Than Time\\" *\\"Cruel Sisters\\" *\\"Utensile Strength\\" The monarchs of the Enchanted Forest are visited by an enchanter's son, bearing a most unusual implement—the Frying Pan of Doom. (His father had been trying for an enchanted sword, and been interrupted at a critical moment.) Their hope is that King Mendanbar and Queen Cimorene can figure out what to do with the thing. It is decided to hold a tournament with a bake-off appended in an effort to match up the weapon with the hero destined to wield it; since only the rightful wielder can handle the pan without an oven mitt, the idea is to grant it to the knight who can touch it without getting burned. Things go sour when an evil magician appears. He has tracked his niece, rightful heir to the kingdom he has usurped, to the Enchanted Forest, and demands her surrender. The attempt of one of the tournament knights to champion her is interrupted when the princess stands forth, unwilling for anyone to be harmed on her behalf (she has been hiding out incognito as a scullery maid, in true fairy tale fashion). To fend off her uncle she grabs the object nearest to hand, which turns out to be the frying pan, and beans him with it with ... interesting results. The rightful wielder having been found, a different prize must be found for the tournament champion, who turns out to be a barbarian with a killer recipe for Quick After-Battle Triple Chocolate Cake. *\\"Quick After-Battle Triple Chocolate Cake\\" (recipe) The aforesaid recipe, devised by the author especially for the book on the demand of her editor. Ingredients and their proportions are helpfully translated from the original barbarian into equivalents familiar to the reader. *\\"Notes from the Author\\" Background information on the pieces in the collection.

The Titii or Tithii were a small and obscure Celtiberian people, whose lands were located along the middle Jalón and upper Tajuña valleys, somewhere between Alhama de Aragón in Zaragoza and Molina de Aragón in Guadalajara provinces.  Origins  The extent of the Titii people is shown in light yellow. The Titii were of Celtic origin, whose ancestors probably migrated to the Iberian Peninsula around the 4th Century BC,Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, III, 29.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 4, 12. and part of the Celtiberians. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that the ancestors of the Celtiberian groups were installed in the Meseta area of the Iberian Peninsula from at least 1000 BC and probably much earlier.  Culture  Due to the lack of extensive archaeological surveys, no Iron Age settlements connected with this people were ever found in the area. Nevertheless, analysis of numismatic finds from the Jalón-Tajuña (ancient Tagonius) area has led some archaeologists to relate the mints of three unknown Celtiberian towns – Aratis/Aratikos, Titum, and Titiakos – with the Titii, pointing Titum as their presumed capital. The town of Aratis/Aratikos was identified in 2014 with the Iron Age site of Castejón I – El Romeral at Aranda de Moncayo in Zaragoza province.  History  Often mentioned in the ancient sources as allies or clients of the Belli, they were subjected to Turboletae raids in the 3rd century BC and seem to have submitted by Carthage just prior to the Second Punic War, but what role they played in that conflict remains obscure. However, during the Celtiberian Wars of the 2nd century BC they sided with the Belli and Arevaci against Rome, being recorded as one of the signataries of the peace treaty with Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus the Elder in 179 BC.Appian, Iberiké 44. The Titii also retained their political autonomy until being defeated alongside the Belli in 142 BC by Proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus MacedonicusAppian, Iberiké 76. and later included into Hispania Citerior province in 134 BC, and thereafter cease to be mentioned by the sources. After 72 BC however, they merged with the Belli, Uraci and Cratistii tribes to create the Late Celtiberian people of romanized southern Celtiberia, losing their tribal identity in the process.

It is an avant-garde work combining elements of free improvisation, experimental rock and chamber music. It reached rank No. 6 in The Wire's list of best 2009 albums.Cf. the official David Sylvian website Retrieved 1 March 2012 Production Manafon was recorded over a three-year period in Vienna, Tokyo and London. Of the recording process, Sylvian said: \\"There was nothing written when we went into the studio – this was very much free improvisation. So, the selection of the group of musicians for each improvisation was paramount. I recognized on the day which pieces could work for me. The process was that I took the material away and then wrote and recorded the vocal line over in a couple of hours. So I couldn't analyze my contribution and that in a way was my form of improvisation – and I enjoyed the rapidity of response.\\" \\"I take the sessions and work on them at a later time. I attempt to 'improvise' lyrics and melodies as I go, writing and recording all in a matter of hours. The basic tracks themselves undergo little or no editing as such. The structure pretty much remains as given from the original sessions. I might add an introduction or overdub other elements onto the original take. Here's a couple of examples: \\"Senseless Violence\\": Recorded in Vienna with Rowe/Polwechsel/Fennesz. I added guitar parts then layered Tilbury's piano into the track then added the vocal and an introduction. \\"Greatest Living Englishman: Initial take\\" suggested acoustic guitar overdubs which I requested of Otomo and Tetuzi on the spot. I later cut and pasted some interesting turntable activity from an alternate take onto this track. I also added an introduction by cutting and pasting elements from an earlier take. Tilbury was added to the coda. Melody and vocal added. \\"Rabbit Skinner\\": no editing. added acoustic guitar myself then vocals.\\" Lyrical inspiration For the recording of Manafon, Sylvian was also inspired by the Welsh poet R. S. Thomas: lyrics often reflect the main themes written by the poet and the title of the album refers indeed to a Welsh namesake village (in north Powys) in which Thomas lived for a while. \\"Manafon is indeed a village in Wales, a village in which Thomas lived for sometime and served as rector to the parish. In this small village, Thomas had trouble filling the pews of a Sunday but in a sense it was something of an idyllic spot in which to raise a child (a strict, taciturn and somewhat indifferent parent), master his profession and write his poetry. So, the physically real village became for me a metaphor for the poetic imagination.\\" Track listing A limited edition boxed set came with a DVD of the album in 5.1 Surround Sound, and a feature-length making-of documentary, Amplified Gesture.

It was secularized in the 19th century and then taken over by the then-new Secretariat of Public Education after the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century. The new agency did extensive remodeling work on the building, including covering nearly all the walls of the two inner courtyards with murals. These murals include Diego Rivera’s first large-scale mural project, which he completed in 1928. Description of the building Main portal The main facade, which faces San Ildefonso Street, is designed to have a classical Greek look. The overall color is white and it has three levels. The decorations on the bottom level have a softer, more rounded appearance but the upper two have sharper lines and a more monumental feel, containing Ionic pilasters. At the top of the facade is a balustrade. In the center, there is a group of sculptures representing the Greek gods Apollo, Minerva and Dionysus done by Ignacio Asunsolo, which were placed here to emphasize the building’s now-secular function. At each end of the facade are Aztec and Spanish-style weapons respectively. The side facade is the original. Most of it is simply covered in tezontle, but there are two reliefs in white stone, “The Visit of the Archangel Gabriel” and The Martyrdom of Lawrence of Rome, which were the first of their kind done in Mexico. The belltower is covered in tilework. The main entrance is marked by three opening with metal grilles that date from the beginning of the 20th century. Inside the entrance, there is a wide nave with a groin vault and two large murals by Roberto Montenegro. There are two interior courtyards that are joined by a stairway that was added by Miguel Constanzó in the 18th century. In the hallway to the first courtyard are allegories of Mexico, Spain, India, Greece and reliefs that allude to the arts by sculpture Miguel Centurión in the passage to the second courtyard. The Murals Covering all of the walls of these two courtyards are murals. 235 panels or 1585.14 m2 of this mural work was done by Diego Rivera between 1923 and 1928. This was Rivera’s first major large-scale mural project. The themes center around workers, and the glorification of all things Mexican, especially the Mexican Revolution. Rivera named the two courtyards “Labor Courtyard” and the other the “Fiesta Courtyard” based on the themes he painted in each. Because he was affiliated with the Communist Party at the time, Rivera painted small hammers and sickles next to his signature on the panels in this building. The larger of the two is the Labor Courtyard, with the ground floor containing panels such as “Entrance to the Mine,” “Leaving the Mine” The “Sugar Mill””Tehuantepec Bath” “Market Scene” “The Weavers” “The Dyers” “The Liberation of the Rural Worker” and “Smelting: Opening the Oven.” Another work, called “The Rural Teacher” shows teachers working in farming areas. This and the “Liberation of the Rural Worker” relate most directly to the Mexican Revolution. Moving from the ground floor to the first floor, the stairway contains murals of landscapes. To the north by the elevator is a landscape of Tehuantepec, and to the south there is a series of murals that refer to the various landscapes and climates found in Mexico, from the coasts to the mountains. First-floor panels are dedicated to intellectual pursuits with grisailles depicting chemistry, medicine, geology, electricity and x-rays. There is also an image of a many-armed Hindu-like goddess bearing a hammer and sickle. In the stairwell to the second floor is a panel called “The Painter, the Sculptor and the Architect” and contains what Rivera considered to be one of his best self-portraits. The grisaille that is on this level is devoting to painting and contains the “four elements”:light (represented by the sun), color (represented by a rainbow), Man and geometry. It is considered to be a synthesis of Rivera’s concept of painting. The second floor has murals titled “The Life of Zapata” and “This is how the Proletariat Revolution will be” with a communist theme. There are also portraits of heroes of the Mexican Revolution including Emiliano Zapata and Felipe Carrillo Puerto. The smaller, or Fiesta Courtyard, has murals by Rivera and other artists. Ground floor has the murals that give the courtyard its name “The Deer Dance” “The Corn Fiesta” “May 1 Meetings” With geometric planes and concentration of figures, “The Day of the Dead” is representative Rivera composition. The upper rectangle is occupied by a trio of a peasant, a revolutionary soldier and a worker with the opposite side containing images representing the clergy, militarism and capitalism. Other panels here are “Good Friday on the Santa Anita Canal” and “The Ribbon Dance.” On the first floor of the Fiesta Courtyard is the coats- of-arms of the different Mexican states painted by Jean Charlot and Amado de la Cueva. On the opposite side of this floor are works by two other painters: “Washerwomen” and “Loadbearers” by Jean Charlot and “The Little Bull” and “The Dance of the Santiagos” by Amado de la Cueva. The second level contains another Rivera work, “The Arsenal,” which has an image of Frida Kahlo distributing arms to revolutionaries. In the far left section of the panel appears the face of David Alfaro Siqueiros. Generally speaking, this corridor is devoted to revolutionary songs called “corridos” that crown and link the murals. Another mural of note is that done by Carlos Mérida, who painted a depiction of the Little Red Riding Hood story in the children’s room. Not all of the murals painted here in the first decades of the 20th century have survived. Roberto Montenegro painted a number but only his portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz survives. Venezuelan painter Cirilio Almeida Crespo is represented by only two remaining works, a portrait of Simón Bolivar and frieze containing the coats-of-arms of Latin American republics. La Encarnación Luis Gonzalez Obregon facade looking from what was the old La Encarnacion Church This building was part of the ex-convent of Santa María de la Encarnación del Divino Verbo, commonly referred to simply as “La Encarnación” founded in 1594 by nuns of the Conceptionist Order. It was founded as a convent for Spanish and Criollo women, becoming the largest and the richest in the city, allowing each nun here to have her own apartment with servants. It was able to accommodate guests such as the Marchioness Calderon de la Barca, who declared the convent to be a palace, telling the nuns that of all the convents she had visited in Europe and Mexico, none were as large or fine as this one. The convent with its church were built between 1639 and 1648, and consecrated in 1645. The project was funded by Alvaro de Lorenzana, who spent 100,000 pesos, an enormous sum at the time. It underwent major repairs in the 18th century due to deterioration. This was done by architect Miguel Constanzó. Reform War until 1923 Like all other convents and monasteries in Mexico, this convent was disbanded after the Reform War in 1861, but its associated church continued to operate as such until 1917. The property became state property and the complex has housed a number of institutions such as the Jurisprudence School, the National Girls’ School and others until after the Mexican Revolution. From 1911 and 1922, the new Secretariat of Public Education (SEP), took over the building at the corner of San Ildefonso and Rep. de Argentina and extensively remodeled it, hiring engineer Federico Méndez Rivas. Since that time, the SEP has taken over a number of other buildings in the city to house offices, but this one still remains the main headquarters See also *Old Customs Buildings, Mexico City *List of colonial churches in Mexico City References Category:Buildings and structures in Mexico City ","title":"Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters"},{"id":"24357613","text":"Steve Coast (born 20 December 1980) is a British entrepreneur and the founder of the OpenStreetMap community-based world mapping project and CloudMade, a geography-related company.

One of the biggest demonstrations organised by ZimRights took place in Harare in 1995 under the leadership of David Chimhini, where protesters demonstrated against police brutality. In an inflammatory speech after the protest, President Mugabe labelled ZimRights \\"Zimlooters\\" and a \\"gangster organization\\". Whilst at Zimrights Hon Chimhini was one of the founding members of the National Constitutional Assembly in 1997 together with Morgan Tsvangirai, Mike Auret, David Coltart, Tendai Biti, Thoko Matshe, Lovemore Madhuku, Welshman Ncube, Priscilla Misihairambwi, Brian Kagoro and many others. Hon Chimhini went on to serve on the NCA board as taskforce member representing Human Rights for the next 4 years. In September 1999 Hon Chimhini was part of the group from civic society that was instrumental in the formation of the Movement for Democratic Change. He was a member of the interim leadership and served in the management committee before the party's inaugural congress in January 2000. Hon Chimhini left ZimRights in 1999 and went on to become the first National Coordinator of the MDC. In the year 2000, Hon Chimhini became a spokesman and National Coordinator of the United People for National Survival (UPNS), an organisation which mobilised people to protest against the destructive policies adopted by the Zimbabwe government. The organisation introduced the now famous red cards with the inscription 'Mugabe must go now'. Other members of UPNS were Wilfred Mhanda of the Zimbabwe Liberators Platform and Archbishop PIus Ncube. Late in the year 2000 Hon Chimhini formed the Zimbabwe Civic Education Trust, an organisation which is involved in peace building, conflict resolution, human rights awareness and civic education and became its founding executive director. Whist working in civic society Hon Chimhini was a board member of the ZESN (Zimbabwe Election Support Network), Centre for Peace Initiatives In Africa and many other organisations. In March 2008 Hon Chimhini contested the Mutasa North seat under the MDC and won comfortably with 10,000 votes against 4,000 votes for Major-General Mike Nyambuya who was then Minister of transport and energy and represented Zanu PF. In parliament Hon Chimhini is a member of the select committee on Education as well as Housing and Social Welfare portfolio committee. Hon Chimhini is the treasurer of the African Parliament Network Against Corruption (Zimbabwe Chapter). Hon Chimhini has continued fighting for human rights and is a member of the ZIMCET board.

Due to his physical characteristics he received the nickname of Txiquito, meaning in Euskera Little. Txiquito de Eibar was one of the first professional players of pelota at the time of its beginnings, in the 19th century.  Early life  Indalecio Sarasqueta was born in Durango, Basque Country. He was the son of Julián de Zarasqueta and Braulia de Uriarte who resided on Aizpiri baserri, where came his later nickname Aizpiri txiki. The Uriarte family was from Durango, where Sarasqueta was born due to a Basque tradition of women giving light in their family homes. The family moved later to Eibar, where he grew up. Professional career Txiquito made his debut in 1876, when he was 16 years old, interrumping with importance in the early game scenarios. First games and later modalities On July 26, 1876 beat on Eibar in hand-pelota modality the priest Laba, from Marquina, taking immediate importance. In August they played again in Bilbao where he won again. In 1877 played several games on pala modality, where he won to one of the most important players of the time, Bishimodu and later to Carricalushe. In 1877 he also played several games on long bat and short bat category. In 1878 he accepted the challenge of a French pelotari that consisted on hit always on the service with the right hand and only use the left after rebound, the challenger could play free of these conditions. The game was played on San Sebastián with a tantora of 50, with a final win of Txiquito de Eibar for 27-50. The same year he participated also in similar challenges with different tasks which he won. In 1858 Basket- pelota was introduced from French Basque country, Txikito de Eibar developed the game to the point that was introduced as a new modality on Madrid fronton. Sarasqueta successfully dominated all the categories of the game during his professional years. Argentina In 1884 Sarasqueta traveled to Buenos Aires where he faced Paysandú, a local popular player, winning the game with 80 points on the modalities of square bat and \\"traer y traer\\" (in this modality a player could pick the kind of ball he wanted to use). Paysanyú used a hard and highly rebound ball, that combined with his service strength made him a difficult rival. After a bad start, Txiquito turned over the game winning with 80 points, leaving the Argentinian player 40 points behind. The games against Argentinian and Basque players in the country gave him fame in Buenos Aires. In 1886, he went back to Spain where, after losing several games due to the weakness caused by his delicate health, he retired. He returned to Buenos Aires where he became the national fronton manager until it was closed on 1894, when he returned again to Spain.Txiquito de Éibar at Éibar magazine, 2007 Later years and death After his definitive return from Argentina in 1894 Indalecio Sarasqueta worked on several frontons as manager such as Beti Jai in Madrid, Euskalduna in Bilbao and the Barcelona fronton. Txiquito continued playing unprofessionally in charity or challenge events, often attended to the games with his son. His preferred modality was pala, in which he could maintain a good level. Ill with tuberculosis, Sarasqueta retired totally and fell into a bad economic situation but was helped by other pelotaris and amateurs. On April 1, 1900, he died in Éibar in his house on Elgeta-kale street known as Olave.Txiquito de Éibar at Éibar magazine, 2006  Sources  Category:Spanish pelotaris Category:1860 births Category:1900 deaths Category:People from Eibar Category:People from Durangaldea Category:Sportspeople from Gipuzkoa ","title":"Indalecio Sarasqueta"},{"id":"24357743","text":"Benson Tower can refer to several buildings: * Benson Tower (New Orleans) * Benson Tower (Portland, Oregon) See also *Benson Water Tower, Clayton Street, Benson, Illinois *Benson (disambiguation) ","title":"Benson Tower"},{"id":"24357745","text":"Kireka is the name of a township in Central Uganda.

It was commanded by lieutenant Mirosław Iringh (\\"Stanko\\").\\"Zgrupowanie 'Kryska' (Czerniakow)\\" (in Polish) (Group \\"Kryska\\", Czerniakow), Vademecum Powstania Warszawskiego Fragment of the exhibit dedicated to the Platoon at the Warsaw Uprising Museum; bottom photograph Mirosław Iringh Formation The unit was formed on the orders of the underground Underground Slovak National Council in 1943.\\"Udział Słowaków w Powstaniu Warszawskim\\" (in Polish) (The Participation of Slovaks in the Warsaw Uprising), Polonus Initially the unit had around 57 soldiers: 28 Slovaks, around 11 Poles, 6 Georgians, 4 French, 3 Hungarians, 2 Armenians, 1 Ukrainian, 1 Czech and 1 Azeri. As such it was the most international unit that fought for the Polish anti-Nazi resistance and in the Warsaw Uprising. The Slovak platoon The platoon was also unique among all the insurgent units during the uprising, in that it wore a different armband from all other AK soldiers (the armband was the distinguishing feature of the insurgents as it clearly marked them as combatants and thus served as a \\"uniform\\"). The usual AK armband was red and white, the colors of the Polish flag, occasionally with a Kotwica inscribed upon it. Platoon 535 however, wore red- white-blue armbands, in the national colors of Slovakia, with the number of the platoon and the Slovakian coat of arms.Bukalska, Patrycja. \\"Pytania Mirosława Iringha\\" (in Polish) (Mirosław Iringh's Question), Tygodnik Powszechny, 2005-08-07 The platoon also had its own standard, resembling the Slovak national flag, which was made by the Courier Janina Szczudłowska (\\"Santorek\\"). Formally, the right of the platoon to wear different \\"uniforms\\" (armbands) was set forth in a specific previous agreement between the Home Army command and Mirosław Iringh, and was meant to underlie the fact that while fighting alongside the Poles, and under the direction of the Home Army, the platoon was an autonomous, independent unit. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the uprising, not all local commanders were aware of the agreement and the different armbands caused some confusion. At one point, the soldiers of the platoon were mistaken for Frenchmen (the national colors of Slovakia and France are the same). Major engagements Initially the platoon was assigned to the 2nd Region of the 5th Area \\"Mokotow\\" and was part of the company \\"Leugna\\" (named after the company commander).Podrygałło, Jadwiga. \\"Isia\\" (in Polish) (Archive of Oral History, Museum of the Warsaw Uprising) However, at \\"W hour\\" (the break out of the Warsaw Uprising) only a portion of the platoon managed to assemble for this action. On the first day of the Warsaw Uprising this part of the unit took part in the attack on Belweder Palace, after which, due to heavy casualties (out of twenty something soldiers, only seven survived), it was forced to retreat to the Chojnowski forest together with all other units of the 5th area. Other parts of the platoon, upon the initiation of the uprising found themselves in Old Town and in Śródmieście (City Center). The largest portion of the platoon, under Iringh operated in the Czerniakow area, where their strength was supplemented with escaped Soviet POWs (mostly Georgians and Armenians). Initially Iringh did not trust them, but soon changed his mind as they proved themselves in battle. The last names of these soldiers are known from Home Army records: Tamaradze, Bibilaszwili, Nazarow, Gasparian, Galustjan, Alchazaszwili. It is known, according to the nurse of the platoon, that Tamaradze died while single- handedly defending a position against attacking Germans on September 15. Some of these former Soviet POWs survived the uprising, managed to cross the Vistula river and reached the inactive Soviet army on the other side, which was standing by as the Germans crushed the uprising. Their fates are unknown (the Soviets routinely executed or exiled their own soldiers who had been captured on the grounds of \\"treason\\", even if they had managed to escape from the German captivity), although Iringh, after the war made numerous efforts to find out their fates. The platoon took part in heavy fighting in the Czerniakow suburb until September 23, 1944. After suffering heavy casualties, along with the entire Group \\"Kryska\\" it was incorporated into the Radosław Group, under the command of Jan Mazurkiewicz. Afterward the remainder of the platoon evacuated to the right bank of the Vistula on makeshift pantoons. Overall, in all of the fighting during the uprising, 75% of the platoon soldiers had been killed in action. Although Iringh was successfully evacuated, his wife Waleria had been trapped in a different part of Warsaw. They were reunited after the war. Once the remainder of the platoon had made it to the zone controlled by the Red Army where they were quartered in an abandoned villa. According to one of the nurses of the platoon (\\"Aga\\") they were well treated and well fed but the building was surrounded by wire. Soon, Iringh arrived and told the nurses of the platoon to leave the place; apparently at this time the former Soviet POWs that were part of the platoon were \\"disappeared\\" and Iringh, wanted to make sure nothing happened to the nurses. One of the nurses made her way to her family in Lublin where eventually she found that Iringh had also made his way there and was in the hospital.

The controversial episode tells the story of a bisexual man who is deliberately infecting people, including series lead character Jack Killian's ex-girlfriend. Activists for HIV/AIDS awareness and LGBT rights disrupted filming, citing concerns over the negative portrayal of bisexual and HIV- positive people and fears that the show would make people with AIDS the targets of violence. Series executives made some changes to the script in response to these concerns, but activists were still displeased. \\"After It Happened\\" performed well in the ratings but received a mixed critical response. Actress Kay Lenz received an Emmy Award for her guest-starring role as Killian's ex-girlfriend Tina. NBC aired a follow-up episode in 1989 in which Tina is near death. This second script, \\"Someone to Love\\", was written in consultation with some of the groups that protested \\"After It Happened\\" and was much more favorably received. Plot Talk radio host Jack Killian is approached by his ex-girlfriend, Tina Cassidy. She tells him that she has become pregnant and infected with HIV from a one-night stand. She wants Jack's help in finding the man so she can inform him of the pregnancy and her HIV status. Killian learns that the man, Mike Barnes, is aware of his HIV status and is deliberately infecting people. In his search for Barnes, Jack meets some of his other victims, including his partner Ross, whom Mike abandoned when Ross got sick, and Kelly West, another one-night stand. Unable to stop Mike legally from infecting people, Jack warns the city about him on his program. Mike confronts Jack about the broadcast but their argument is interrupted by Kelly, who pulls a gun on Mike. Jack talks Kelly out of killing Mike.Tropiano, pp. 101–02 Cast * Gary Cole as Jack 'Nighthawk' Killian * Wendy Kilbourne as Devon King * Kay Lenz as Tina Cassidy * Richard Cox as Mike Barnes * J. D. Lewis as Ross Parker * Julia Montgomery as Kelly West Controversy and critical response When \\"After It Happened\\" went into production in San Francisco in October 1988, the script originally ended with Kelly shooting Mike to death. This script was leaked to AIDS activist groups, who were outraged. They contended that the script as written increased the likelihood of vigilante violence against LGBT people and people with AIDS. Series executive producer Bob Singer disagreed, saying, \\"The hero says that the murder is absolutely the wrong solution. No one watching it could think we were condoning this by any stretch of the imagination.\\" Three groups took the lead in organizing the protests: the San Francisco AIDS Foundation; ACT UP San Francisco; and Mobilization Against AIDS.Capsuto, p. 225 On October 20 about 60 ACT UP demonstrators shut down outdoor filming by chanting, blowing whistles and disabling lighting equipment. This was the first time that a gay- related disruption caused a production to be suspended since the 1979 protests against the film Cruising in New York City.Capsuto, p. 224 Midnight Caller production company Lorimar Television agreed to alter the script. The ending was changed so that Kelly would still kill Mike but would be shown being arrested. Activists still considered this unacceptable and swore to continue disrupting the filming. Lorimar obtained temporary restraining orders against two of the protest groups on October 24, requiring them to stay at least 100 feet away from filming; the activists promptly announced that they would ignore the orders. Demonstrators shut down production again on October 25. Singer announced that day that the ending would be changed again, to eliminate Mike's killing entirely. Some additional changes were made, such as including a scene in which the bartender at a gay bar denounces Mike's behaviour as \\"irresponsible\\",Capsuto, p. 226 but Lorimar refused to meet another demand, that Mike be unaware of his HIV status. Lorimar executive Leslie Moonves denied that the changes were politically motivated, saying simply \\"we were concerned about being responsible.\\" On the night of the broadcast, between 200 and 300 demonstrators organized by ACT UP San Francisco picketed San Francisco's then-NBC affiliate, KRON, demanding that the station not air the episode. Around 150 people occupied the lobby and 10 who refused to leave were arrested. About a dozen members of ACT UP Philadelphia demonstrated outside that city's then-NBC affiliate, KYW. KRON went ahead with the broadcast but opened the program with a disclaimer: > Tonight's episode of Midnight Caller deals with the topic of AIDS. San > Francisco is a role model in AIDS education and has set the standard for > effective and humane public policy. The station referred viewers with questions to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Following the episode, KRON aired Midnight Caller: The Response, a live 30-minute news special in which city health officials and community leaders expressed their concerns with the episode's content.Tropiano, p. 103 Activists continued to denounce the episode, with the AIDS Foundation's Steven Petrow saying, \\"By broadcasting a program that portrays an individual with the AIDS virus as a malicious, calculating killer who's out to infect others, we believe NBC is exhibiting the same type of callousness and ignorance that ignites and perpetuates acts of AIDS-related discrimination and violence.\\" A publicist for Lorimar, Barry Stagg, disagreed with this assessment. While acknowledging that the changes made at the behest of the AIDS groups were effective, he defended the episode, saying, \\"We think a lot of good will come out of this episode and that people will think more carefully about responsible sex.\\" Years later series star Gary Cole said of the protesters, \\"They got it all wrong. We didn't exploit the tragedy of AIDS — we made an interesting TV show which covered a subject worrying more and more people.\\" \\"After It Happened\\" finished second in its time slot, behind an episode of thirtysomething. The episode was 33rd overall for the week, earning a 13.5 household rating. Reviews were mixed. Television critic Jon Burlingame, while finding the episode preachy in places (which he blames on the rewrites), finds that it \\"includes moments of strong drama\\" and is \\"not the flame-fanning irresponsible TV show that some protesters have painted\\". Robert DiMatteo sharply differed. Although he praised some of the episode's moments, as when Jack physically comforts Tina (thus showing that there is no risk of HIV transmission through casual contact), other parts of the story were dismissed as simplistic and the characterization of Mike Barnes as \\"ludicrous and moldy, like [something] from The Boys in the Band\\". Yardena Arar found the scenario \\"far-fetched\\" and insulting to the intelligence of the women of San Francisco. Guest star Kay Lenz won an Emmy for her role as Tina. \\"Someone to Love\\" Midnight Caller revisited the subject of AIDS in season 2 with the episode \\"Someone to Love\\", with Tina, near death, returning to Jack. Stephen Zito also wrote the script for this episode. Now having a better idea of the politics of AIDS in San Francisco, Zito met with some of the groups who had protested the original episode and members of a support group for women with AIDS; he spent five months writing. Guest star Lenz, reprising her role as Tina, also met with the support group. The support group idea was incorporated into the episode, with other women infected by Mike Barnes forming one and going on Killian's show. Much of what they said was taken directly from the group with whom Zito and Lenz met. The San Francisco AIDS Foundation praised the script, calling it \\"an extremely accurate and honest portrayal\\" that illustrated the issues faced by people with AIDS.

Almost all of the range belongs to the drainage basins of the Zarafshan River. The Persian name is believed to possibly be a reference to gold found in bed of the Zarafshan River and its tributaries, which has ushered prosperity to the region from ancient times. Geography and geology The Zarafshan River M39 between Samarkand and Shahrisabz. The range extends over in an east−west direction along the south of Sughd Region in Tajikistan, reaching the highest point of (Chimtarga Peak) in its central part. South-west of Panjakent the range crosses from Tajikistan into Uzbekistan, where it continues at decreasing elevations () along the internal border between Samarkand and Kashkadarya Regions provinces, until it blends into the desert south-west of Samarkand.Atlas of the Soviet Republics of Central Asia, Moscow, 1988, in Russian. There are two other mountain ranges running in an east−west direction parallel to the Zarafshan Range. To the north, the Zeravshan Valley runs east for approximately from Samarkand and separates the Zarafshan Range from the Turkestan Range. To the south, the Hisar range runs parallel to the Zarafshan Range. To the west of Lake Iskanderkul, the Zarafshan Range and the Gissar Range are connected by the Fann Mountains, which is the highest part of both ranges. The Zarafshan Range is crossed in the meridional direction by three rivers: the Fan Darya, the Kashtutu Darya, and the Maghian Darrya, all of which flow north and are left tributaries of the Zarafshan. The part of the Zarafshan Range east of the Fan Darya is known as the Matcha Range. It has heights around and in the east, it is connected to the Alay Range and the Turkestan Range. This point (the Matcha Mountains) is the location of the Zarafshan Glacier, which is long and is one of the longest glaciers of the Central Asia. The northern slopes of the Matcha Range are relatively smooth and descend to the Zarafshan, whereas the southern slopes sharply drop to the valley of the Yaghnob River. The highest part of the range is located between the Fan Darya and the Kashtutu Darya and includes the Fann Mountains. The western part of the range is up to and is forested. The southern slopes of the western part of the ridge belong to the drainage basin of the Kashka Darya, which rises in the range's southern watershed. The river terminates between Panjakent and Lake Karakul. Water is precious in the region and is utilized for irrigation − an irrigation system that has developed involves 85 main canal totalling a length of . There are several passes crossing the range, including Akhba-Tavastfin, Akhba-Bevut, Akhba-Guzun, Akhba-Surkltat, Darkh Pass, Minora, and Marda-Kishtigeh. Various elevations include at Kshtut Pass, at Mount Chandara, and at Mount Hazret Sultan. Fan Darya makes a gorge going across the ridge. The road connecting Dushanbe and Khujand is built in the ridge. The geological formations in the mountains of the upper Zarafshan Valley contain minerals such as coal, iron, gold alum and sulphur. Gold is reported from the entire course of the Fan Darya, Kashtutu Darya, and Maghian Darya. History The slopes of the range have been populated since antiquity. Prehistoric Siypantosh Rock Paintings are preserved in the Uzbek portion of the range. In about 400 BC, they belonged to the Iranian civilization of Sogdiana. In 330 BC, during the Asian Campaign, troops of Alexander the Great reached the Zarafshan Valley. The name of Lake Iskanderkul clearly originates from the name of Alexander - Iskander; however, attempts to place a connection between the lake and the campaign only exist at the level of legend. Together with the rest of Western Tajikistan, the Zarafshan Range has changed hands several times, being part of the Hephthalite Empire, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the Samanid Empire. In the 13th century, it was taken over by the Mongols, and in the 16th century, became part of the Khanate of Bukhara. The Zarafshan, Yaghnob, and Fan Darya valleys were essentially controlled by local authorities (beks). The fortress of Sarvoda was built to protect the gorge of the Fan Darya. In 1862, the Russian Empire started to penetrate to Central Asia. By 1870, Russian troops occupied both the Zarafshan and the Yaghnob valleys, with the last operation being the Iskanderkul Expedition in the spring of 1870, under the command of the Major General Alexander Abramov. During the expedition, Russian troops took the Yaghnob Valley under control. After 1870, military topographers started to map the mountains, including the Zarafshan Range. In 1870, Alexey Fedchenko lead an expedition to the Zarafshan Valley, and in 1880, Ivan Mushketov discovered the Zarafshan Glacier and investigated the upper part of the valley. In 1892, Vladimir Komarov investigated the Yaghnob valley. In 1868, Zarafshan Okrug was split from the Emirate of Bukhara. The Okrug was controlled by Russian authorities, but the authority at the local level remained with the beks. The whole Zarafshan Range was inside the okrug. On January 1, 1887 Samarkand Oblast was established, with the administrative center in Samarkand. In 1924, Samarkand Oblast was abolished and split between newly established Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, corresponding to the contemporary division between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Population All valleys of the range are populated. There are no towns in the range; the closest towns are Panjakent and Samarkand. A major road between Dushanbe and Khujand crosses the range; another road to Samarkand follows the Zarafshan River. The roads into secondary valleys, including the Yaghnob valley, are mostly unpaved and poorly maintained. Most of the population of the range are Tajiks. The population of the Yaghnob Valley are the Yaghnobi. Tourism The Fann Mountains, and, to lesser extent, the Matcha Mountains are popular among mountaineers and hikers.

Early life and service Ludwig Gaim was born in Deggendorf, the Kingdom of Bavaria, on 1 April 1892. He joined an artillery unit in the Imperial German Army during August 1914. He served on the Verdun Front and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class on 21 October 1914. He continued artillery duty until July 1916. He then transferred to the Luftstreitkräfte for aviation duty with Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 293 (Flier Detachment (Artillery) 293).
