In a racing career which lasted from May 1998 until November 1999, she won four races and was placed five times from sixteen starts. She was one of the best juvenile fillies in Britain in 1998 when she won the Empress Stakes, Cherry Hinton Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes as well as finishing second in the Lowther Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the 1000 Guineas on her seasonal debut and went on to win the Flying Fillies' Stakes, as well as being placed in the Coronation Stakes, Oak Tree Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes. She was retired from racing to become a broodmare and produced at least seven winners. Background Wannabe Grand was a bay mare with a large white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by the horse breeding company Vizcaya Ag. She was sired by Danehill, a sprinter who won the Cork and Orrery Stakes and Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. He went on to become a highly successful breeding stallion, producing the winners of more than one thousand races including 156 at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, Duke of Marmalade, Rock of Gibraltar George Washington and North Light. Wannabe Grand's dam Wannabe won one minor race from six starts as a three-year-old in 1993 and also produced the Ballycorus Stakes winner Wannabe Better. Wannabe was a descendant of the broodmare Woodlark who was a half-sister to Alycidon and the grand-dam of Larkspur. As a yearling in October 1997, Wannabe Grand was consigned by the Chippenham Lodge Stud Tattersalls and bought for 60,000 guineas by David Morris. During her racing career, the filly was owned by Bruce McAllister and trained by Jeremy Noseda at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1998: two-year-old season On her racecourse debut, Wannabe Grand finished fourth in a six furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 25 May and then finished second in a similar event at Newmarket eleven days later. On 25 June the filly was moved up in class for the Listed Empress Stakes at over six furlongs at Newmarket and started the 7/4 favourite against five opponents. Ridden by John Reid she took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by three quarters of a length and half a length from Aunt Flo and Miss Universe. Walter Swinburn took over the ride when the filly was stepped up in class again for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes over the same course and distance on 7 July. The David Loder-trained Spirit Willing started favourite ahead of the Queen Mary Stakes runner-up Pipalong and the French challenger Pescara, with Wannabe Grand starting at odds of 11/1 in the ten-runner field. After being restrained by Swinburn in the early stages she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Pipalong with Pescara a short head away in third. Wannabe Grand was beaten in her next three races. On 25 July she finished fourth behind Mythical Girl, Gipsy Rose Lee and Rustic in the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. In the Lowther Stakes at York on 20 August she finished second of the ten runners behind Bint Allayl with Flanders in third and Mythical Girl in sixth. In September she was sent to Ireland for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh and ran fourth behind Edabiya, Fear and Greed and Crystal Downs. Noseda felt that the soft ground and strong headwind had led to the filly's stamina being overtaxed. On her final appearance of the season, Wannabe Grand, ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery was one of nine fillies to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket on 29 September. Noseda had not intended to run the filly but changed his mind when Bint Allayl was injured; he commented \\"I honestly thought that we would never beat Bint Allayl so, if we went to Newmarket, we would be running for a place. But that has changed now and we might be able to win\\". She was made the 3/1 favourite ahead of the Godolphin filly Subeen whilst the other runners included Flanders, Miss Universe, Circle of Gold (winner of the Prestige Stakes), Golden Silca (Mill Reef Stakes), Imperial Beauty and Atlantic Destiny (Sirenia Stakes). After being restrained in the early stages, she began to make progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by half a length from Imperial Beauty. Subeen took third just ahead of Miss Universe, Atlantic Destiny and Circle of Gold. 1999: three-year-old season On her three- year-old debut, Wannabe Grand started a 16/1 outsider for the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 2 May. She raced up the stands side of the Rowley Mile course (the left-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint), and after being held up by Eddery in the early stages she finished well to place second to Wince, beaten half a length by the winner, with Valentine Waltz a short head away in third. In the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June she started the 11/4 favourite but dead-heated for third with Valentine Waltz behind Balisada and Golden Silca. The filly was brought back to sprint distances in July and started favourite for the July Cup in which she was matched against colts and older horses. She finished seventh of the seventeen runners behind Stravinsky. Later that month she was made favourite for the Listed Oak Tree Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, but after taking the lead inside the final furlong she was caught in the final stride and beaten a head by the Henry Cecil-trained Selfish. On 22 August, Wannabe Grand started the 10/11 favourite for the Listed Flying Fillies Stakes over six furlongs at Pontefract Racecourse. After tracking the early leader Noble One, she moved up to dispute the lead a furlong out and won by half a length from Pipalong. On her final appearance in Europe, Wannabe Grand contested the Haydock Sprint Cup on 4 September and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind the four-year-old colt Diktat. For her last two races, the filly was sent to race in North America and was moved up in distance. In the Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes over nine furlongs at Keeneland Racecourse on 9 October she was ridden by Robby Albarado and stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third behind Perfect Sting. Eddie Delahoussaye took over the ride in the Matriarch Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 22 November, when the filly finished fifth of the nine runners behind Happyandunoit. Breeding record Wannabe Grand was retired from racing to become a broodmare. In December 2009 she was auctioned at Tattersalls and bought for 62,000 guineas by Badgers Bloodstock. Relocated to Double S Bloodstock in New South Wales, Australia in 2009, Wannabe Grand has produced 13 foals and seven winners to date: *Bachelor of Arts, a bay colt, foaled in 2001, sired by Stravinsky.

Founded in 1867, it is one of the three oldest facilities of what is now the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. When founded, it was known as the Central Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, and it is under this name that a portion of its campus, along with the adjacent Dayton National Cemetery, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2012, for its role in the history and management of veterans affairs. Campus The medical center in September 2008. The Dayton VA campus is located on Dayton's west side, bounded on the north by Dayton National Cemetery (itself bounded on the north by West 3rd Street), the east by South Gettysburg Avenue, the south by United States Route 35, and on the west by Liscum Drive. The expansive property includes a large number of buildings, most of which were built between about 1930 and 1960 to fulfill the VA's mission in a variety of ways. They include administrative facilities, hospital and other medical facilities, housing complexes (some still in use as such, others used for other purposes, and others standing vacant), and landscaped grounds. A small handful of buildings remain from its earliest days. History In 1866 the United States Congress established the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS), the precursor of the VA, to provide medical and other facilities for veterans of the American Civil War. Three centers were established in the following years: the Eastern branch in Togus, Maine, the Central Branch in Dayton, and the Northwestern Branch in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Dayton facility was the administrative center of the home, and its principal commissary. The landscaped grounds of its early days included a conservatory and a small zoo, which were local tourist attractions in addition to providing restorative functions to veterans living at the facility. In 1930 the NHDVS was merged with other organizations to form the Veterans Administration, and the Dayton facilities underwent a major modernization over the following 20 years. The facilities were expanded and further modernizes in the 1980s and 1990s, most visibly with the construction of the Inpatient Tower and associated medical complex, which now dominate the western portion of the campus. A portion of the complex, including the adjacent cemetery (also founded in 1867), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 for its significance in local and state history, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012 for its national importance in the administration of veterans affairs.

Meanwhile he dreams of writing a great \\"American Symphony\\". Needing more money he falls in with Judge B. T. Belden (Carle), an unscrupulous showman who exploits Carl's violin ability. Lucy convinces him that this is dangerous to his reputation as a serious musician. The couple moves into a boardinghouse run by Mrs. Briggs (La Verne), where Carl works on his compositions while Lucy supports them. Shamed by remarks about letting his wife support him, Carl gets a job playing piano in a saloon. Lucy becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy, Charles. Ten years later Carl is working as a piano and violin teacher, but is unable to interest Charles (Woods) in music. In order to earn extra money he reluctantly sells some of his songs to an advertising agent. Meanwhile, Charles gets a young woman, Helen Burroughs (Mercer), pregnant, and is forced by his father to marry her. In an attempt to redeem himself Charles enlists in the Spanish-American War, where he is killed. Helen dies giving birth to a son, Eric. Returning from World War I Eric (Farley) adapts Carl's beloved Negro Spirituals into Jazz, including the song My Beloved. He continues to plagiarize additional music, featured in stage hits sung by Patricia Sedley (Hall), whom Eric later marries. Carl visits Eric's publisher, Mr. Yates (Clark) who insults him by calling his music a poor imitation of Eric's. Finally, Alexander Talbot (Shaw) of the \\"Metropolitan Symphony Society\\", encouraged by a donation from Eric, looks at Carl's American Symphony and, impressed, agrees to perform it. Reconciled, Eric and Carl attend the performance where Lucy's ghost smiles to hear her husband's work finally performed. During the performance Carl dies, happy that he has at last been recognized.

It was designed by Philip Hanman and built from 1949 to 1959. It is also known as Gladstone Yacht Club. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 2009.  History  The Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse was constructed between 1949 and 1959 by members of the Port Curtis Sailing Club. The club was formed in 1941 by the sailing fraternity of Gladstone to provide facilities and support for the sport, as well as a venue for social functions. While renovations were undertaken to the building in recent years, the core of the post-war building remains as a landmark on Auckland Inlet. The clubhouse evolved from an initial concept as a single-storeyed boat storage facility to a double-storeyed building with boat storage underneath and an entertainment and dining venue above. The clubhouse is known Australia-wide for its association with the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, the finish of which is hosted by the Port Curtis Sailing Club. This race has been a highlight of the Australian sailing calendar since its inauguration in 1949 and was the first ocean race held in Queensland. Sailing clubs for both recreation and competitive sport have been active in Queensland since the late nineteenth century, including: Brisbane Sailing Club (established 1885), Fitzroy Sailing Club at Rockhampton (1895), Sandgate Yacht Club (1897), Townsville Yacht Club (1901), Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron (1902), Oxley Sailing Club (1902), South Brisbane Sailing Club (1903); Cleveland Yacht Club (1904), and Cairns Yacht Club (1908). New clubs formed after World War Two and many new and existing clubs began building clubhouses at this time. The Townsville club credits the post-war Olympic Games for a renewed interest in sailing, while others suggest returned servicemen seeking adventure and camaraderie led to the formation of new clubs. In terms of social regattas, it is likely that the improved economy, growth in car ownership and improved roads allowed sailors to tow their boats to compete in regattas around the State. It is clear that many clubs utilised remnant war-time buildings to create clubhouses and most, like Port Curtis Sailing Club, took advantage of member's skills, enthusiasm and business contacts in the construction process. Sailing and rowing were popular activities on the Gladstone harbour (Port Curtis). Regattas were often held on Separation Day (10 December) in the 1870s. By 1890 regattas were held annually on Easter Monday. These were the forerunners of the more recent Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race held over the Easter weekend. Rowing was also popular on the harbour. Twenty four people with an interest in rowing or sailing met on 3 April 1941 at Feros' Paramount Cafe and formed the Port Curtis Aquatic Club. Shortly after that the club sought permission from the Gladstone Harbour Board to place a set of rails in Auckland Creek for launching and retrieving boats. The war led to a downturn in sailing activities, but the club reformed in 1946. Members quickly realised that sailing was the main interest so on 3 September 1947 it was renamed the Port Curtis Sailing Club. Fund raising to build a clubhouse commenced and the club asked the Gladstone Harbour Board for a site. In July 1948 the Gladstone Town Council agreed to grant the remainder of the Reserve for Baths (between the baths and Auckland Inlet) to the Gladstone Harbour Board, provided the council could continue to access the drainage pipes for the baths. The baths which had been built by the council in 1936 were situated at the corner of Goondoon and Lord Streets. By granting the remainder of the reserve to the Harbour Board, the council was in essence, providing a site for the sailing club on the harbour front. In 1948 the Queensland Cruising Yacht Club (QCYC) approached the Port Curtis Sailing Club with a proposal to establish a race between Brisbane and Gladstone. This was to be the first ocean racing event in Queensland. Gladstone Mayor Jack O'Malley was enthusiastic about the proposal, although he had little local support initially. The sailing club began planning for the event, with a particular focus on the finish of the race which was to be at the Auckland Point Jetty. Six weeks prior to the event, Gladstone was hit by a destructive cyclone. The sailing club still wanted to proceed with building a club house and wrote to the Harbour Board in March 1949 seeking clarification of the dimensions of the land it intended to lease to the club for its clubhouse. In April 1949 the club made a request to the Gladstone Town Council for number of substantial trees knocked over by the cyclone on Council land. Council agreed and these trees were used in the construction of a clubhouse. The inaugural Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race was held at Easter 1949. No Gladstone yachts participated in the race although a number of locals crewed on the winning boats. Despite particularly heavy weather, the race was deemed a success and plans were made by the Port Curtis Sailing Club and the QCYC to ensure it was an annual event. As local interest in sailing grew, so did the need for a Gladstone club house. In 1950 a resurvey was undertaken of the Gladstone baths (R.270, Portion 22) and the land between the baths and Auckland Inlet. The latter was to be the site of the Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse, but vested as a Reserve for Harbour Purposes (R.301, Portion 119). Club members continued to procure more trees felled during the 1949 cyclone, this time from local graziers with family interests in the club. Members were involved in the long process of milling the logs. In 1953 land was reclaimed for a clubhouse. The fill came from Auckland Hill, which had been successively excavated for fill over the years, particularly in the 1950s. Locals drew up a basic design for the clubhouse, initially for a single-storeyed boat and gear shed. When extra timber was procured, architect Phil Hanman refined the plans to include two storeys with a dance hall on the top floor. While the initial funds were raised through debentures, the construction of the dance hall was specifically to provide an income stream for the club. Other fundraising means included art unions, dances, socials and door knocking for donations. The Gladstone Port Authority lent the club a pile driver and timber piles were driven into the reclaimed land to depths ranging between . In 1954 the piles were capped with concrete and the construction of the frame work began. All work was done by volunteer labour and supervised by professional tradesmen. Building materials were sourced through a number of means including donations from local businesses. Construction was inhibited by post-war building material regulations, in which all available materials were destined for housing. At first, permission was only granted to build and roof the lower storey, with the upper floor waiting until material shortages eased. One section of the building was completed by 3 May 1955 and club members were able to move in. In November 1957 the Gladstone Harbour Board wrote to the local Land Commissioner stating that the Sailing Club Building was in fact beyond the official boundary of the reserve, towards Auckland Inlet. The boundaries were then extended by an Order in Council on 19 June 1958, without re-surveying. The sailing club building was completed by the chairman of the Gladstone Harbour Board, local councillor and builder, Mr W R Golding MBE. The official opening was held on the evening of 28 March 1959 in time for the Easter Regatta. The Port Curtis Sailing Club's clubhouse was erected during a period of expanded interest in amateur sailing in Queensland after World War Two. At least eleven clubhouses have been identified as being constructed for Queensland sailing/yacht clubs in the 1940s and 1950s and like Port Curtis Sailing Club premises, most utilised donated materials and labour: Sandgate Skiff Club (1944), Southport Sailing Club (1946), Sandgate Sailing Club (1948), Townsville Sailing Club (1948), Maryborough Sailing Club (1950), North Queensland Cruising Yacht Club (1952), Oxley (1953), Bulimba (1953), South Brisbane (1956), Darling Point (1958) and Port Curtis (1959). Sandgate Skiff Club relocated a former church hall to its Cabbage Tree Creek site, near to where the Sandgate Yacht Club had reconstructed old army huts into the Sandgate Memorial Boat Shed in 1948 (later handed over to the Queensland Cruising Yacht Club). Maryborough Sailing Club initially used an old World War Two Navy boatshed and built a clubhouse beside it in 1950, using new and recycled materials. The North Queensland Cruising Yacht Club in Bowen relocated a former WRAAF Mess Hall and like Port Curtis, raised money through debentures for the 1952 project. The Oxley Sailing Club had been given a parcel of riverfront land. Timber was donated in 1951 for the first boat shed which was completed by club members in June 1953. Bulimba Sailing Club volunteers built its clubhouse in 1953 and raised the building later to accommodate boat storage. South Brisbane Sailing Club was given a lease in Orleigh Park, and the clubhouse was built by volunteer labour in 1956. Darling Point was built by club members in 1958. Only six of the eleven post-war clubhouses remain: Oxley, South Brisbane, Darling Point (relocated to Manly Breakwater in 1978), Sandgate, Bulimba and Port Curtis. It appears that Port Curtis Sailing Club is the only extant clubhouse from the 1940s and 1950s to have used an architect in its design. Architect Phil Hanman, who designed the upper floor, had served with club vice president Doug Patrick in the Middle East during World War Two. At Gladstone, the Harbour Board continued to reclaim land and in February 1967 the boundaries of R.301 (which included the sailing club site) were amended to reflect this reclamation. On 14 December 1967, R.301 was cancelled and Portion 119 was vested with the Gladstone Harbour Board. The sailing club then negotiated with the Gladstone Harbour Board for a lease on the clubhouse site for up to 75 years. To gain a liquor licence during the mid 1970s an association was formed between the sailing club, the Port Curtis Air Sea Rescue, and the Gladstone Power Boat Club, to create the Gladstone Yacht Club as an entity. The air sea rescue and boating club are no longer associated with the yacht club which is now the trading name for the Port Curtis Sailing Club Inc. The Port Curtis Sailing Club installed a pontoon sometime in the 1980s. In the 1990s the clubhouse was extended and upgraded including the addition of an open veranda on the north- east side, an extension on the north-west, and a new licensed bar area in part of the original ball room facing Auckland Creek, which was opened up with a glass front. A large verandah was added to the western side which included a restaurant. The project was designed by architect Allan Jeffery who assured the club that the original 1950s building would last for many more years and was a credit to the local volunteer builders. These new extensions were formally opened on 13 September 1997. The Port Curtis Sailing Club has been proactive in organising a number of significant sailing activities and events in Queensland. In 1960 the club commenced \\"learn to sail\\" classes for local children and in 1961 it purchased ten sabots and initiated the South Queensland Sabot Association. It then negotiated with the Gladstone State High School to run the first sailing classes in Queensland High Schools. The Port Curtis Sailing Club provided the boats and the expertise. 1961 was also the year of the first Harbour Festival which was organised by the club to entertain spectators waiting for the yachts to arrive in the Brisbane to Gladstone race. The festival continues to be an annual event, though now organised through the local council. The club has also organised a wide range of ocean racing events including the Gladstone to Bowen, Gladstone to Bundaberg, Gladstone to Cairns, Gladstone to Great Keppel and Gladstone to Hamilton Island. Another first was claimed by club member Lesley Barker who was sailing mistress for the first all girl crew in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1975. Club stalwart and foundation member Noel Patrick won the Brisbane to Gladstone on five occasions in his boat Wistari. He also published the first sailing directory for the Port Curtis region Cruising the Curtis Coast in 1986. The Port Curtis Sailing Club has always been part of the organisational team involved in managing the finish of the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race. Other organisations involved include the Gladstone Volunteer Marine Rescue, Gladstone Harbour Festival Committee, Gladstone Port Corporation, Gladstone Marina, Gladstone Mayor's office and interested local citizens. While the formal trophy presentations have been held at various locations over the 60 year history of the race, including the Town Hall, O'Connell Wharf and the clubhouse, the social activities have always occurred at the Port Curtis Sailing Club. The Club is open 24 hours a day during the Easter weekend in order to welcome sailing crews as they arrive. A plotting room is set up in the sail training room on the ground floor providing public access to the progress of the race. Electronic monitoring is managed at the adjacent Volunteer Marine Rescue headquarters. In November 2008 the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race was awarded the first prize in the \\"festival and events\\" category at the Queensland Tourism Awards. The race now generates festivals in Redcliffe (Festival of Sails) and Gladstone (Harbour Festival) and is recognised as a significant ocean racing event in Australia, second only to the Sydney to Hobart race. For race participants, it is known as \\"the friendly race\\", and the camaraderie amongst participants is what draws competitors back annually. The clubhouse was also awarded the Best Small Social Club in 2007 and 2008 in the Clubs Queensland Achievement Awards. The importance of the clubhouse to the race was summed up in 1983 by the Commodore, Julian Walker, who commented prior to the race: \\"Port Curtis Sailing Club is gearing up to make you feel welcome and give you an atmosphere in which to swap yarns and tall stories.\\"  Description  Clubhouse seen from Goondoon Street, 2014 Auckland Inlet, opposite Port Curtis Sailing Club, 2014 The Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse marks the northern end of Goondoon Street, Gladstone's main street, where the land slopes towards Gladstone Harbour. It forms part of a series of maritime structures at the mouth of Auckland Inlet including the Port Authority boat ramp, the O'Connell Wharf to the north, the Volunteer Marine Rescue Gladstone building and a recently constructed Customs building. It is located on largely flat ground overlooking the boat ramp towards the harbour. The Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse is a timber-framed structure which has been altered and extended since its completion in 1959. The 1950s structure forms the core of the existing building and various extensions have taken place around its perimeter. The building has a large hipped roof clad with galvanised metal sheeting with the main ridge finishing at gablets at either end. At the north-western end the hipped roof extends lower to form a balcony space. A two storey section has been added along the main north-eastern elevation. On the opposite side of the building a large deck with a curved roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting has been added. A two-storeyed kitchen wing has also been added behind the new deck space. The main elevation, which faces to the north-east, features a protruding entry area and a parapet wall which extends for most of the length of the building. These are formed from timber sheeting. Narrow lengths of corrugated metal sheeting have been fixed to form column- like details within the parapet wall, framing each end and the entry area. The exterior is clad with chamferboards at the base with fibre- cement sheeting with timber cover strips to the remainder. A cantilevered street awning is located above the entry area with \\"Port Curtis Sailing Club\\" in lettering fixed along its front edge and \\"Gladstone Yacht Club\\" in lettering adjacent to the entry door. Narrow window hoods cover each of the window bays. Timber casement windows are located above the street awning. A verandah space on the upper level has exposed steel posts and balustrades with a small enclosed area clad with fibre-cement sheeting. Recent aluminium windows are located adjacent to the entry on the second level and on the lower level. On the north-west elevation which overlooks the boat ramp and Auckland Inlet is a recently added enclosed balcony space supported on cantilevered tapered steel beams. The balcony is roofed with a skillion roof which extends from the hipped main roof and is enclosed with fixed and sliding glass panels. Adjacent to the balcony space is a recent outdoor dining area with a steel framed curved roof. The undercoft area below the outdoor dining area is open. The lower level of the building is enclosed with fibre cement sheeting with chamferboards at the base. Openings are varied throughout the building and include metal roller-doors, aluminium framed sliding and hopper windows, louvre windows. A recent kitchen extension has been added to the rear south-western corner of the building which has a hipped roof and is clad with fibre cement on the upper floor and enclosed with blockwork on the lower level. The building consists of various dining and bar areas on the upper floor with storage for boats and catering equipment on the lower level. The two levels are linked by an early stairwell which remains largely intact and is reached from a small foyer/entry area adjacent to the main entry. A new office has been constructed in the foyer area. The upper floor has been divided into a central lounge bar, balcony dining area and function room. The verandah space to the north-east has been enclosed to form a games room. A new outdoor dining area is located behind the lounge bar to the west. The lower floor of the building is largely open for storage with early timber stumps visible. A training room has been enclosed in the north- east corner and a catering storage area formed by blockwork in the southern corner. The upper floor has walls lined with vertically fixed painted chamferboards and plasterboard sheeting. The ceiling is lined with plasterboard with some recessed ceiling panels visible. Floors are lined with recent linoleum strip sheeting with carpet in some areas. The internal stairwell has walls lined with long lengths of chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting with cover strips. The staircase has treads and risers of polished timber and balustrades with timber cappings. The balcony space has walls and ceilings lined with plasterboard. On the lower floor walls and ceilings are generally unlined with some early louvre windows visible which are hidden behind cladding on the outside. The grounds include lawned boat-rigging areas adjacent to the concrete boat ramp to the north of the clubhouse and bitumened carparks in front of the building (fronting Goondoon Street) and at its rear to the west. A white, painted steel flagpole is located to the north. There is a recent pontoon extending into Auckland Inlet, but this sits outside the heritage boundary.  Heritage listing  Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse, constructed between 1949 and 1959 on Auckland Inlet at Gladstone, is important in illustrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history, namely the development of the sport of sailing in Queensland. The place is important for its close association with the annual Easter-weekend Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, inaugurated in 1949 and second only to the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in terms of significance in Australian ocean racing. The race was awarded first prize in the \\"festival and events\\" category at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2008. The Port Curtis Sailing Club has played an integral role in the management of the race since its inception, and its clubhouse remains an iconic venue for end-of-the-race celebrations by participants, organisers and spectators alike. A plotting room set up in the sail training room on the ground floor of the clubhouse provides public access to the progress of the race, and the clubhouse has been the venue for the presentation of race trophies. The Club also has been credited with initiating the South Queensland Sabot Association and being the first in Queensland to offer sail training as a high school subject, activities that were based at the clubhouse. The clubhouse remains one of the earlier sailing club facilities on the Queensland coast. The 1950s core of the clubhouse survives, with undercroft boat storage and sail training room, and a former dance hall on the upper level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse is significant for its special association with the Australian sailing community as the principal venue for the celebration of the end of the annual Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race, and as a past venue for the presentation of race trophies.

It is made up of the two subdivisions ‚ÄúVordere W√ºste‚Äù and ‚ÄúHintere W√ºste‚Äù (W√ºste Superior and W√ºste Inferior). Its central location and good infrastructure make it an appealing residential area.  Geography  W√ºste is located to the southwest of the city centre, in a valley between Kalkh√ºgel and Westerberg. Martinistra√üe and Blumenhaller Weg form the district‚Äôs border with the Weststadt district, located to the north. On the west side, the Bundesautobahn 30 (federal motorway nr. 30) forms the border with Hellern. The district is crossed at its most southerly point by the railway line between M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck ‚Äì from there the border runs along the line up to Sutthauser Stra√üe. Afterwards it follows the street path along Rosenplatz and Kommenderiestra√üe up to Johannistorwall. Walking along the wall, the border is reached at the crossing of the Schlosswall and Martinistra√üe. At an earlier date the area was connected to the tram network on line 3, which ran from Martiniplatz (Heinrich-L√ºbke-Platz) to Schinkel via Arndtplatz, Neumarkt and Hauptpost. The only substantial waterway in W√ºste is the Pappelgraben, created in the 17th century. It had originally been conceived as a border line, however from 1781 to 1784 it was converted into a drainage channel (only partially successfully). Its name derives from the poplars which were planted on the north side of the channel in 1829. With the extension of the channelization and subsequent development of the W√ºste, the Pappelgraben was rebuilt and extended from 1960 onwards. Today it runs to the rainwater retention basin at H√∂rner Bruch. W√ºste‚Äôs largest lakes are its two retention basins, the W√ºstensee and the Pappelsee. The W√ºstensee was built on Schreberstra√üe during 1975 and 1976. The addition of the Pappelsee, built during the following decade along the street ‚ÄúAm Pappelgrabben‚Äù, saw the construction of another artificial lake with close-to-nature ambience.The Pappelgraben in the W√ºste district  History  The name ‚ÄúW√ºste‚Äù refers to the former state of today's district ‚Äì initially it was the scene of an Ice Age fen, described as ‚Äúw√∂st‚Äù (uninhabitable) in Low German. Plans were made during the 18th century to use the area for ranching cattle, however its natural state made it ill-suited for this purpose. Not even the construction of the Pappelgraben managed to drain the area properly. The removal of Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs fortifications from 1843 onwards led to an increase in the demand for plots of land. This led to an extensive draining of the W√ºste using earth masses from the old city walls. From the start of the 20th century to the 1960s household waste, rubble, slag and ashes were used for this purpose. In the early 1990s, construction work revealed the presence of harmful substances. Investigations showed that about 270 hectares of land were polluted by PAH, lead, cadmium, barium, copper and zinc. Out of 1,700 residential sites surveyed, 218 exceeded the test value set by the Bundesbodenschutzverordnung (Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordnance). As a result, W√ºste became known as one of Germany‚Äôs largest contaminated sites. From 2006 to 2008, the sanitation of over 70 plots of land took place over three phases. The municipal administration of Osnabr√ºck covered the resulting costs; however the owners of the properties had to pay for the restoration of their gardens.Contaminated sites in W√ºste  Infrastructure  Gymnasium ‚ÄúIn der W√ºste‚Äù (W√ºste Grammar School) The district has a school centre made up of a primary school, middle school and the Gymnasium ‚ÄúIn der W√ºste‚Äù ‚Äì convenient public transport links result in them being attended by many pupils from the surrounding region. The district is served by bus lines 51 and 91/92 along with the N9 night bus. W√ºste‚Äôs education centre for the hearing-impaired is a state-funded special school, enabling pupils with auditive difficulties to obtain their Mittlere Reife (secondary school) qualifications. The local churches are the Christuskirche (Methodist) and the Freikirche (Baptist).

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.9, which, according to the Bortle scale, indicates that it is visible to the naked eye from suburban skies. Parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft put the star at a distance of around 58 light years. This is a G-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of and an estimated age of just 237 million years. It has slightly more mass and a slightly larger radius than the Sun, but a somewhat lower abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. It is spinning relatively quickly, with an estimated rotation period of 4.84 days. The surface magnetic field of the star has a complex and variable geometry. It is a BY Draconis variable star with an active chromosphere, which means there is a rotational modulation of its luminosity due to star spots. Much like the Sun, the star spot activity undergoes a periodic cycle of maxima and minima lasting roughly yr. Its apparent magnitude varies between a maximum of 5.92 and a minimum of 5.95 over a period of 24.9 days. However, the rotation period is on average 4.84 days. The star shows an anti-solar pattern of rotation, with the rotation rate steadily increasing during each cycle before dropping back to the initial value upon the start of a new cycle. In 2007, the discovery of a brown dwarf companion was announced. HN Peg B was spotted using the Spitzer Space Telescope at an angular separation of 43.2 arc sec, showing a methane emission characteristic of T-type dwarfs. The separation corresponds to a projected physical distance of 795 AU, which is uncommonly wide for such brown dwarf companions. The estimated mass of the object is 28 MJ. Based upon its spectrum, HN Peg B has relatively thin cloud decks. This star displays an emission of infrared excess that suggests there is a circumstellar disk of debris in orbit. HN Pegasi is most likely a thin disk population star. It is a member of the nearby Hercules-Lyra association of stars that share a common motion through space.

The Purdue University football team traces its origin back to October 29, 1887, when its team fell to Butler College by a score of 48‚Äì6 in Indianapolis, Indiana. A group of students at Purdue University formed the school's first football team in 1887. Albert Berg was hired as the coach. Despite being deaf, Berg was reportedly \\"the only man in the territory with any knowledge of the game.\\" Berg was 23 years old when he became Purdue's football \\"coacher.\\" He was paid $1 for each lesson he gave to the newly organized football team and had only one week to prepare the team for its first game. The 1887 Purdue team played its only game on October 29, 1887, against the Butler College team at Athletic Park in Indianapolis. Butler soundly defeated Berg's squad by a score of 48‚Äì6. J. B. Burris was the team captain. Schedule Roster * Henry Luke Bolley * J. B. Burris * Henry Caraway * Charles Gough * R. Gregory * L. D. Hord * Dumont Lotz * B. F.

It was renamed Theseus for about a year before being given its final name, Orpheus. Epirotiki overhauled the ship for two years to bring it in line with market conditions, reducing its capacity for passengers from 1,500 to 372 while increasing passenger comfort, adding a pool and redesigning the cabins. Orpheus was relocated to the Americas where it sailed in Alaska, Mexico, and Panama for about one year. It was then relocated to Greece and operated in the Mediterranean. In 1974, the cruise line Swan Hellenic chartered the ship. Despite its age, Orpheus was very popular with British passengers, but by the mid-1980s it became difficult for the ship to hide its age. Swan Hellenic replaced it with Minerva. Orpheus was decommissioned in 1998 and scrapped in 2000.

Intuitively, coherent waves have a well-defined constant phase relationship. However, an exclusive and extensive physical definition of coherence is more nuanced. Coherence functions, as introduced by Glauber and others in the 1960s, capture the mathematics behind the intuition by defining correlation between the electric field components as coherence. These correlations between electric field components can be measured to arbitrary orders, hence leading to the concept of different orders of coherence. The coherence encountered in most optical experiments, including the classic Young's double slit experiment and Mach-Zender interferometer, is first order coherence. Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss performed a correlation experiment in 1956, and brought to light a different kind of correlation between fields, namely the correlation of intensities, which correspond to second order coherence. Higher order coherences become relevant in photon-coincidence counting experiments. Orders of coherence can be measured using classical correlation functions or by using the quantum analogue of those functions, which take quantum mechanical description of electric field (operators) as input. While the quantum coherence functions might yield the same results as the classical functions, the underlying mechanism and description of the physical processes are fundamentally different because quantum interference deals with interference of possible histories while classical interference deals with interference of physical waves.  Definition  The electric field E(\\\\mathbf{r},t) can be separated into its positive and negative frequency components E(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t) + E^-(\\\\mathbf{r},t). Either of the two frequency components, contains all the physical information about the wave. The classical first-order, second order and n-th order correlation function are defined as follows :G_c^{(1)}(x_1, x_2) = \\\\langle E^-(x_1) E^+(x_2) \\\\rangle, :G_c^{(2)}(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = \\\\langle E^-(x_1) E^-(x_2) E^+(x_3) E^+(x_4) \\\\rangle, :G_c^{(n)}(x_1,x_2,...,x_{2n}) = \\\\langle E^-(x_1) ... E^-(x_n)E^+(x_{n+1}) ... E^+(x_{2n}) \\\\rangle, :where x_i represents (\\\\mathbf{r}_i, t_i). While the order of the E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t) and E^-(\\\\mathbf{r},t), does not matter in the classical case, as they are merely numbers and hence commute, the ordering is vital in the quantum analogue of these correlation functions. The first order correlation function, measured at the same time and position gives us the intensity i.e. G_c^{(1)}(x_1, x_1) = I. The classical n-th order normalized correlation function is defined by dividing the n-th order correlation function by all corresponding intensities: \\\\gamma^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1) = \\\\frac{G_c^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1)}{G_c^{(1)}(x_1,x_1)...G^{(1)}(x_n,x_n)}. In quantum mechanics, the positive and negative frequency components of the electric field are replaced by the operators \\\\hat{E}^+ and \\\\hat{E}^- respectively. In the Heisenberg picture, \\\\hat{E}^+ = i \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mu} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_k}{2 \\\\epsilon_0 V}} \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mu} e^{i \\\\mathbf{k}.\\\\mathbf{r}} \\\\mathbf{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mu}, where \\\\mathbf{k} is the polarization vector, \\\\mathbf{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mu} is the unit vector perpendicular to \\\\mathbf{k}, with \\\\mu signifying one of the two vectors that are perpedincular to the polarization vector, \\\\omega_k is the frequency of the mode and V is the volume. The n-th order quantum correlation function is defined as: :G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) = Tr[\\\\hat{\\\\rho} \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_1) ... \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_n) \\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{n+1}) ... \\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{2n})]. :Here the orders of the \\\\hat{E}^+ and \\\\hat{E}^- operators do matter. This is because the positive and the negative frequency (\\\\hat{E}^+ and \\\\hat{E}^-) components are proportional the annhiliation and the creation operators respectively, and \\\\hat{a} and \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger} do not commute. When the operators are written in the order shown in the equation above, they are said to be in a normal ordering. Subsequently, the n-th order normalized correlation function is defined as: :g^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1) = \\\\frac{G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1)}{G^{(1)}(x_1,x_1)...G^{(1)}(x_n,x_n)}. A field is said to m-coherent if the m-th normalized correlation function is unity. This definition holds for both \\\\gamma^{(m)} and g^{(m)}. Young Double Slit Experiment 512x512pxIn Young's double slit experiment, light from a light source is allowed to pass through two pinholes separated by some distance, and a screen is placed some distance away from the pinholes where the interference between the light waves is observed (Figure. 1). Young's double slit experiment demonstrates the dependence of interference on coherence, specifically on the first-order correlation. This experiment is equivalent to the Mach-Zender interferometer with the caveat that Young's double slit experiment is concerned with spatial coherence, while Mach-Zender interferometer relies on temporal coherence. The intensity measured at the position \\\\mathbf{r} at time t is :\\\\langle I \\\\rangle = \\\\langle |E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 \\\\rangle = \\\\langle I \\\\rangle =I_1 + I_2 + 2 \\\\sqrt{I_1 I_2} |\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)cos \\\\phi(x_1,x_2) . Light field has highest degree of coherence when the corresponding intereference pattern has the maximum contrast on the screen. The fringe contrast is defined as V = \\\\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}. Classically, I^{max}_{min} = I_1 + I_2 \\\\pm 2 \\\\sqrt{I_1 I_2} |\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)and hence V = \\\\frac{2 \\\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}|\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)|}{I_1 + I_2}. As coherence is the ability to interfere visibility and coherence are linked: :|\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)= 1 means highest contrast, complete coherence :0 < |\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)< 1 means partial fringe visibility, partial coherence :|\\\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)= 0 means no contrast, complete incoherence. Quantum Description Classically, the electric field at a position \\\\mathbf{r}, is the sum of electric field components from at the two pinholes \\\\mathbf{r}_1 and \\\\mathbf{r}_2 earlier times t_1, t_2 respectably i.e. E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = E^+(\\\\mathbf{r_1},t_1) + E^+(\\\\mathbf{r}_2,t_2). Correspondingly, in the quantum description the electric field operators are similarly related, \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\mathbf{r_1},t_1) + \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\mathbf{r}_2,t_2). This implies :I = Tr[\\\\rho \\\\hat{E}^-(\\\\mathbf{r},t) \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t)] = I_1 + I_2 + 2 \\\\sqrt{I_1 I_2} |g^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)cos \\\\phi(x_1,x_2) . The intensity fluctuates as a function of position i.e. the quantum mechanical treatment also predicts interference fringes. Moreover, in accordance to the intuitive understanding of coherence i.e. ability to interfere, the interference patterns depend on the first-order correlation function g^{(1)}. Comparing this to the classical intensity, we note that the only difference is that the classical normalized correlation \\\\gamma^{(1)} is now replaced by the quantum correlation g^{(1)}. Even the computations here look strikingly similar to the ones that might be done classically. However, the quantum interference that occurs in this process is fundamentally different from the classical interference of electromagnetic waves. Quantum interference occurs when two possible histories, given a particular initial and final state, interfere. In this experiment, given an initial state of the photon before the pinhole and it final state at the screen, the two possible histories correspond to the two pinholes through which the photon could have passed. Hence, quantum mechanically, here the photon is interfering with itself. Such interference of different histories, however, occurs only when the observer has no specific way of determining which of the different histories actually occurred. If the system is observed to determine the path of the photon, then on average the interference of amplitudes will vanish. Hanbury Brown and Twiss Experiment Figure 2. A schematic diagram for the setup for Hanbury Brown and Twiss's original experiment. In the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment (Figure 2.), a light beam is split using a beam splitter and then detected by detectors, which are equidistant from the beam splitter. Subsequently, signal measured by the second detector is delayed by time \\\\tau and the coincidence rate between the original and delayed signal is counted. This experiment correlates intensities, |E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t + \\\\tau)E^+(\\\\mathbf{r},t)|^2, rather than electric fields and hence measures the second order correlation function :G_c^{(2)}(t,t+\\\\tau, t + \\\\tau, t) = \\\\langle E^-(t) E^-(t + \\\\tau) E^+(t + \\\\tau) E^+(t)\\\\rangle. :Under the assumption of stationary statistics, at a given position, the normalized correlation function is :g^{(2)}= \\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\hat{E}^-(0) \\\\hat{E}^-(\\\\tau) \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\tau) \\\\hat{E}^+(0) \\\\rangle}{ \\\\langle \\\\hat{E}^-(0) \\\\hat{E}^+(0) \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\hat{E}^-(\\\\tau) \\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\tau) \\\\rangle} g^{(2)} here measures the probability of coincidence of two photons being detected with a time difference \\\\tau. For all varieties of chaotic light, the following relationship between the first order and second-order coherences holds: g^{(2)}(\\\\tau) = 1 + |g^{(1)}(\\\\tau)|^2. This relationship is true for both the classical and quantum correlation functions. Moreover, as |g^{(1)}(\\\\tau)always takes a value between 0 and 1, for a chaotic light beam, 1\\\\leq g^{(2)}\\\\leq 2 . The light source used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss was stellar light which is chaotic. Hanbury Brown and Twiss used this result to compute the first order coherence from their measurement of the second order coherence. The observed second order coherence the curve was as shown in figure 2. For Gaussian light source g^{(1)} = e^{-i \\\\omega_0 \\\\tau -\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}(\\\\frac{\\\\tau}{\\\\tau_0})^2}. Often a Gaussian light source is chaotic and consequently, 500x500pxg^{(2)}(\\\\tau) = 1 + e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}(\\\\frac{\\\\tau}{\\\\tau_0})^2}. This model fits the observation that was done by Hanbury Brown and Twiss using stellar light as demonstrated in figure 4. If thermal light was used instead of stellar light in the same setup, then we would see a different function for the second order coherence. Thermal light can be modeled to be a Lorentzian power spectrum centered around frequency \\\\omega_0, which means \\\\langle E^*(0) E(\\\\tau) \\\\rangle = E_0^2 e^{-|\\\\tau|/\\\\tau_0} , where \\\\tau_0 is the coherence length of the beam. Correspondingly, g^{(1)} = e^{-i \\\\omega_0 \\\\tau -|\\\\tau|/\\\\tau_0} and g^{(2)}(\\\\tau) = 1 + e^{-2 |\\\\tau|/ \\\\tau_0}. The second-order coherence for stellar (Gaussian), thermal (Lorentzian) and coherent light is shown in Figure 5. Note that when stellar/thermal light beam is first order coherent i.e. g^{(1)}(0)=1, the second order coherence is 2, meaning at zero time delay chaotic light right is first order coherent but not second order coherent. Quantum Description Classically, we can think of a light beam as having a probability distribution as a function of mode amplitudes, P(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}) and in that case, the second order correlation function G^{(2)}(\\\\tau,0) = \\\\langle E^-(\\\\tau)E^+(\\\\tau)E^-(0)E^+(0)\\\\rangle \\\\int P(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}) E^*(\\\\tau)E(\\\\tau)E^*(0)E(0) d\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}. If we assume that the quantum state of the setup is \\\\rho = \\\\int d\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\} P(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}) |\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}|, then the quantum mechanical correlation function,G^{(2)}(\\\\tau,0) = Tr[ \\\\rho \\\\hat{E}^-(\\\\tau)\\\\hat{E}^+(\\\\tau)\\\\hat{E}^-(0)\\\\hat{E}^+(0)]= \\\\int P(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}) E^*(\\\\tau)E(\\\\tau)E^*(0)E(0) d\\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha_k \\\\\\\\}, which is same as the classical result. 500x500px Similar to the case of Young's double slit experiment, the classical and the quantum description lead to the same result, but that does not mean that two descriptions are equivalent. Classically, the light beams arrives as an electromagnetic wave and interferes owing to the superposition principle. The quantum description is not as straightforward. To understand the subtleties in the quantum description, assume that photons from the source are emitted independent of each other at the source and that the photons are not split by the beam splitter. When the intensity of the source is set to be very low, such that only one photon might be detected at any time, accounting for the fact that there might be accidental coincidences, which are statistically independent of time, the coincidence counter should not change with respect to the time difference. However, as shown in Figure 3., for stellar light g^{(2)}(\\\\tau) = 1 + e^{-2 |\\\\tau|/ \\\\tau_0}, so without any time delay g^{(2)}(0) = 2 and with a large time delay \\\\lim_{\\\\tau \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}g^{(2)}(\\\\tau) = 1. Hence, even when there was no time-delay the photons from the source were arriving in pairs! This effect is termed photon bunching. Moreover, if a laser light was used at the source instead of chaotic light, then second order coherence would be independent of the time delay. HBT's experiment allows for a fundamentally distinction in the way in which photons are emitted from a laser compared to a natural light source. Such a distinction is not captured by the classical description on wave interference. Higher Order Coherences and Mathematical Properties of Coherence Functions For the purposes of standard optical experiments, coherence is just first-order coherence and higher-order coherences are generally ignored. Higher order coherences are measured in photon-coincidence counting experiments. Correlation interferometry uses coherences of fourth- order and higher to perform stellar measurements. We can think of G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1) as the average coincidence rate of detecting n photons at x_1,...,x_n positions. Physically, these rate are always positive and therefore G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1) \\\\geq 0. m-th order coherent fields A field is called m-th order coherent if there exists a function E(x) such that all correlation functions for n < m factorize. Notationally, this means :G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) = \\\\prod\\\\limits_{j=1}^{n} E^*(j)E^*(j+1) This factorizability of all n correlation functions implies that |G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n})|^2 = \\\\prod\\\\limits_{j=1}^{2n} G^{(1)}(x_j,x_j) . As g^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) was defined to be \\\\frac{G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_n;x_n,...,x_1)}{\\\\prod\\\\limits_{j=1}^{n} G^{(1)}(x_j,x_j)}, it follows that |g^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n})|=1 for n, if the field is m-coherent. For a m-coherent field, the m photons being detected will be detected statistically independent of each other. Upper bound the order of coherence Given an upper bound on how many photons can be present in the field, there is an upper bound on the M-th coherence the field can have. This is because \\\\hat{E}^+ is proportional the annihilation operator. To see this, begin with a mixed state for the field \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n,m} c_{n,m} n \\\\rangle \\\\langle m |. If this sum has an upper limit on n,m i.e. M > n,m , Tr[\\\\rho \\\\hat{E}^+(x_1)...\\\\hat{E}^+(x_p)] is proportional to Tr[\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n,m} c_{n,m} \\\\hat{a}...(\\\\text{p times})...\\\\hat{a} |n \\\\rangle \\\\langle m] = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n,m} c_{n,m} \\\\langle m|\\\\hat{a}...(\\\\text{p times})...\\\\hat{a} |n \\\\rangle =0 for p > m . This result would be unintuitive in a classical description, but fortunately such a case has no classical counterpart because we cannot put an upper bound on the number of photons in the classical case. Stationarity of the statistics When dealing with classical optics, physicists often employ the assumption that the statistics of the system are stationary. This means that while the observations might fluctuate, the underlying statistics of the system remains constant as time progresses. The quantum analogue of stationary statistics is to require that the density operator, which contains the information about the wavefunction, commutes with the Hamiltonian. Owing to Schr√∂dinger equation, \\\\frac{d \\\\rho}{dt} = \\\\frac{-i}{h}[H,\\\\rho], stationary statistics implies that the density operator is independent of time. Consequently, in G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) , owing to the cyclicity of the trace, we can transform the time independence of the density operator in the Schr√∂dinger picture to the time independence of \\\\hat{E}^{+} and \\\\hat{E}^{-}, in the Heisenberg picture, giving us :G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) = Tr[\\\\hat{\\\\rho} \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_1,t) .... \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_n,t) \\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{n+1},t) ...\\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{2n,t})] = Tr[\\\\hat{\\\\rho} \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_1,t+\\\\tau) .... \\\\hat{E}^{-}(x_n,t+\\\\tau) \\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{n+1},t+\\\\tau) ... \\\\hat{E}^{+}(x_{2n},t+\\\\tau)]. This means that under the assumption that the underlying statistics of the system are stationary, the n-th order correlation functions do not change when every time argument is translated by the same amount. In other words, rather than looking at actual times, the correlation function is only concerned with the 2n-1 time differences. Coherent States  Coherent state are quantum mechanical states that have the maximal coherence and have the most \\"classical\\"-like behavior. A coherent state is defined as the quantum mechanical state that is the eigenstate of the electric field operator \\\\hat{E}^+. As \\\\hat{E}^+ is directly proportional to the annihilation operator the coherent state is an eignenstate of the annihilation operator. Given a coherent state \\\\alpha \\\\rangle , G^{(n)}(x_1,...,x_{2n}) = Tr[\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n,m} c_{n,m} \\\\hat{a}...\\\\hat{a} \\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\alpha] = \\\\langle \\\\alpha|\\\\hat{a}...(\\\\text{p times})...\\\\hat{a} |\\\\alpha \\\\rangle = 1 . Consequently, coherent states have all orders of coherences as being non-zero.

Early life and education Aarons was born in the Bronx, NY, where his father worked in the garment industry. He graduated from the City College of New York in 1942. During World War II he served in the Army Signal Corps. He studied physics at Boston University, earning his M.S. degree in 1949. In 1953 he won a Fulbright scholarship and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Paris. Physics From 1948 to 1981 Aarons worked as a senior scientist at the Air Force Geophysics Research Laboratory at Hanscom Field, where his research helped to improve satellite and global positioning technology. Sunanda Basu of the National Science Foundation described Aarons as \\"a pioneer in beacon satellite studies of the ionosphere\\" whose name \\"has now become synonymous with the field of ionospheric scintillations.\\" Having worked with many European scientists while studying in Paris, in 1957 he formed the Joint Satellite Studies Group, an international group of scientists who studied atmospheric effects on satellite signals. This group eventually expanded to become the Beacon Satellite Studies (BSS) Group, which still holds biannual meetings around the world. Early on, he encouraged his BSS colleagues to set up numerous ionospheric monitoring stations, which later proved useful to the Air Force in designing its space- based communication and navigation systems. The group's research laid the groundwork for ionospheric space-weather studies. In 1981 Aarons became a research professor in the astronomy department at Boston University, and in 1987 helped to establish the university's Center for Space Physics. While at B.U. he researched the effects of magnetic storms on the equatorial and high- latitude ionosphere using GPS satellites. He published over a hundred scientific papers in the course of his career, and edited a book about scintillation phenomena.

Photography Boy in Front of Girls, North End, 1955, by Aarons Aarons first became interested in photography as a youth, taking pictures of his family in Rockaway, New York. Later, while pursuing his college degrees and working as a scientist, he continued to develop his craft, taking his camera with him on business trips around the world. He is best known for his photographs of Boston's ethnically diverse West End and predominantly Italian North End neighborhoods, taken during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Much of the West End was razed in the late 1950s as part of a large-scale urban renewal project, making Aarons's photographs of the area especially important for historical purposes; the Boston Public Library has an extensive collection of his work. As a street photographer he was influenced by Sid Grossman, Lisette Model, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Brassa√Ø. His work has also been compared to that of Helen Levitt and Leon Levinstein. He took informal photos of people in public places, often without their knowledge. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Aarons chose not to focus on the lives of the downtrodden, writing in his notes: \\"I resolved to capture the day-to-day life experiences of the people, avoiding scenes of poverty.\\" His street scenes are often lively and vibrant, populated by ordinary people who are portrayed with dignity, evincing a fundamentally humane outlook. He was keenly interested in the way people presented themselves in public: often with flair, as in Boy in Front of Girls, North End, 1955 (shown), in which a young man, presumably Italian-American, strikes a dramatic pose for the camera. Unlike many other street photographers, he opted for a twin-lens reflex camera (Ciro-flex, and later a Rolleiflex) rather than a 35 mm camera. Shooting from waist level rather than eye level made him less conspicuous, and therefore less likely to intrude on the candid scenes. Even more than his subjects and composition, it was his printing skill that distinguished him as a photographer. He kept a darkroom in the basement of his home, which was featured in an episode of This Old House in 2010; a segment of the show was devoted to his photography. His photographs are included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the DeCordova Museum, the Bostonian Society, and the Boston Public Library, and have been exhibited at the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art, the Boston University Art Gallery, the West End Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Galerie Agathe Gaillard (Paris), the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, the Danforth Museum, the Underground Gallery (NYC), and other venues.

By the end of 2006, the company had won 149 contracts worth around $10.5 million. In early 2007, AEY secured a nearly $300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles, aviation rockets and other munitions. The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China, violating the terms of AEY's contract with the US Army, which bans Chinese ammunition. Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted, and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition. As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers - Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal - the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures. Packouz was sentenced to seven months of house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States. He is the central subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips dramedy film War Dogs. Packouz himself has a cameo role in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home. Packouz went on to invent a guitar pedal drum machine, the BeatBuddy, and is currently the CEO of music technology company Singular Sound. Early life Packouz was born in 1982 in St. Louis, Missouri, to a Jewish family.

Miami New Times. Packouz was a Licensed Massage Therapist at the time of his working at AEY.

By the end of 2006, they had won 149 contracts worth around $10.5 million. In early 2007, AEY secured a nearly $300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles, and aviation rockets. The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China, violating the terms of AEY's contract with the US Army, banning Chinese ammunition. AEY had failed to perform on numerous previous contracts, including sending potentially unsafe helmets and failure to deliver 10,000 Beretta pistols to Iraq. During a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation documents were produced to show that federal agencies terminated, withdrew, or canceled at least seven previous contracts with AEY for poor quality or late deliveries. Packouz responded by email to his associates that they had to get rid of the crates with the Chinese markings since Chinese products were prohibited and would not be accepted and AEY repackaged the Chinese ammunition which, according to the United States government, constituted fraud. The issue of the Chinese ammunition became the focal point of a months-long legal and logistical disturbance in the United States Army and the Department of Justice; AEY received much media attention, especially due to the age of the young Miami Beach arms dealers and their penchant for marijuana, earning them the epithet of \\"the stoner arms dealers\\" or \\"the dudes\\". Diveroli and David Packouz pled guilty to one count of Conspiracy to Defraud the United States under the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 371, in January 2011.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 January 2004.  History  The Big Fig at Miriam Vale is thought to have been planted around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, local residents recalling the Fig Tree as being well established by the 1920s. Or it may have been the fig tree planted \\"about a chain from the main entrance of the railway station\\" in 1916 by the Miriam Vale Progress Association. Whatever its origins, it became a focus for community activity, both social and economic, through much of the 20th century. The tree is a well-known landmark and meeting place in the town, and until 1977 served as the site for the collection of local cream and milk for rail or road transportation to Gladstone, dairying being an important economic activity in the Miriam Vale district. Miriam Vale pastoral run was one of the earliest established in the Port Curtis district, reputedly taken up in January 1854 by Arthur PJ Chauvel and Joseph Sharp, along with the runs of Urquhart, Polmaily and Walton, soon after the proclamation of the Port Curtis Pastoral District on 10 January 1854. Acceptance of their tender for these runs did not appear in the New South Wales Government Gazette until 9 June 1857. Walter Blomfield, reminiscing in 1949, states that cousins Edwin Cordeaux Blomfield (Walter's father) and EK Cox purchased the lease, along with 8,000 sheep, in 1856, although the lease was not recorded in Queensland as being transferred to Cox and Bloomfield until 1869. Early squatters in the area concentrated on wool production, exporting their produce via Gladstone, which was established in 1853-54. In 1868 Cox and Bloomfield applied under the conditions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 for their runs Woodlands, Miriam Vale and Polmaily to be consolidated as the Miriam Vale run and Silex, Ilex and Gochen to be consolidated as Bulburan. Miriam Vale was divided into resumed and leasehold sections in 1869/70, but there was little demand to open this land for selection. Some Miriam Vale land had been taken up as freehold by 1884. In January 1875 a telegraph office was opened at Miriam Vale, and a post office was established there in April 1877, reflecting a population increase in the district. The first Miriam Vale selections were made available in 1889, encouraging new settlers into the area. Saw milling was an important adjunct industry, as the land was cleared for grazing or agriculture. Miriam Vale was first listed as a separate district in the Queensland Post Office Directory of 1892. It had a population of about 60, but no real township. The post office was located at Miriam Vale, but closest settlement appears to have been in the Mount Jacob area at that time. In 1893 the Miriam Vale Hotel was established and the Miriam Vale Post and Telegraph Office was made official. The township of Miriam Vale was surveyed in 1895 in anticipation of completion in 1896-97 of the final segment of the Gladstone-Bundaberg section of the North Coast Railway. The route passed close to the Miriam Vale Post and Telegraph Office on House Creek, and the Miriam Vale railway station and township were established in the vicinity. The opening of the railway to Gladstone on 1 October 1897 had an immediate impact on the development of the Miriam Vale district. With ready access to markets now available via the railway, 90 Miriam Vale blocks were thrown open for selection between 1897 and 1902, and district residents listed in the Post Office Directories jumped from 26 in 1896-97 to 83 in 1900. The Miriam Vale State School was opened on 14 July 1897. Dairying emerged as an important economic activity on these selections, boosted by the establishment of a butter factory at Gladstone in the early 1900s. In September 1904 the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was formed at Gladstone, with the express purpose of establishing a regional butter factory, which opened at Gladstone about March 1906. Located adjacent to the main railway line, it provided an accessible market for cream produced by regional dairy farmers, including those at Miriam Vale. The Big Fig at Miriam Vale is located close to the Miriam Vale railway station. It is a Ficus benjamina, which is an introduced species to the area, and may have been planted as a Queensland Railways initiative following construction of the North Coast Line through the Miriam Vale district in 1896-1897. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Queensland Railways Department promoted ground and garden improvements at its stations, and encouraged the planting of quickly growing, large-canopied trees which would help to keep down dust and provide travellers with shade. Near several of the railway stations along the Bundaberg-Gladstone section of the North Coast Line a single large Ficus benjamina has been planted, suggesting that the tree at Miriam Vale was part of an early Railways Department tree-planting scheme. However, this has not been confirmed, and there are several local stories suggesting that the tree was planted in the early 1900s by differing early residents. Older Miriam Vale residents can recall the tree as having reached a substantial size by the 1920s and 1930s, such that horses could be tethered underneath it while their owners attended to business at the nearby general store, and children played in its branches. The Big Fig has provided a shady meeting spot for generations of Miriam Vale residents, and since construction of the nearby war memorial in 1921 has provided welcome shade for many Anzac Day commemorations. Farmers and their drays (later trucks) congregated under the tree while waiting for their cream cans to be loaded onto the train to Gladstone. In the 1950s/1960s a Gladstone veterinarian regularly visited Miriam Vale, where he conducted consultations beneath the Big Fig. The tree maintained its connection with the dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside the trunk of the Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds to the north of the trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp. The Big Fig is an instantly recognisable landmark in Miriam Vale and its expansive canopy has provided a shady resting place for generations of travellers passing through the town to Agnes Water and the Town of Seventeen Seventy. It has recently been adopted by Miriam Vale Community Development Inc. as its official logo. Plans have already been made by this group for the future conservation of the tree, with a board walk, rest area and interpretive information planned to be constructed beneath the Big Fig. In January 2015, the Gladstone Regional Council needed to prevent the fig tree's roots from interfering with the road and neighbouring properties as figs have very invasive roots. Having sought the advice of an arborist, the roots will be trimmed back and a barrier inserted to prevent them regrowing in that direction.  Description  The Big Fig (Ficus benjamina) is situated in an unused corner of the Station Street road reserve bounded by a railway fence to the north, a private fence to the east, Blomfield Street to the south and Station Street to the west. Both streets are sealed and a drain has been constructed opposite the trunk of the tree on Station Street. The site is located in the commercial centre of Miriam Vale, close to the railway station, and adjacent to the War Memorial Park to the west, which lies between the Fig Tree and the Miriam Vale Hotel on the other side of Blomfield Street, opposite the railway station. The Big Fig is easily identified when entering the eastern end of the main street, which tourists travelling through to Agnes Water and the Town of Seventeen Seventy must do. The Big Fig is associated visually with Miriam Vale Shire Council's town beautification scheme along Blomfield Street, in which the reserve on the railway side of the street has been converted into a long, tree-lined park fitted with amenities for local residents and tourists. The trunk of the Fig Tree is approximately in circumference, and the canopy has a span of approximately east to west, by north to south. The lower branches of the tree near the trunk are very high and thick. The outer limits of the canopy droop down to near ground level on the western, northern and eastern sides. The crown of the canopy is between high. There is no grass cover under the canopy to the west and south of the tree, and sparse ground cover near the fence lines of both the railway yard and private property. Leaf litter covers most of the ground surface beneath the canopy. The tree root system protrudes from the trunk and surface roots are evident to the west and south of the trunk.  Heritage listing  Big Fig was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 January 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Big Fig at Miriam Vale, adjacent to the Miriam Vale Railway Station, is thought to have been planted around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. During much of the 20th century it had an important association with the development of dairying in the Miriam Vale district, being associated with the collection of Miriam Vale cream and milk for transport by rail, and later road, to Gladstone for processing. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Big Fig has aesthetic qualities which have contributed significantly to the Miriam Vale townscape since at least the 1920s, and which are valued by the Miriam Vale community and visitors alike. The tree is a well-known landmark in the town, and is recognised by, and is familiar to, visitors who pass through Miriam Vale to the coastal holiday towns of Agnes Water and the Town of Seventeen Seventy. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Big Fig is significant as a popular meeting place for generations of Miriam Vale residents, and the current Miriam Vale community holds the historical, social and tourism values of the tree in high esteem.

It was one of the few successful Italian reactions to Operation Achse, and one of the first acts of resistance by the Italian armed forces against Nazi Germany after the armistice of Cassibile. Background When the armistice between Italy and the Allied forces was announced, on the evening of 8 September 1943, the harbour of Bastia, in Italian-occupied Corsica, was packed with both Italian and German vessels; moored in the harbour were the Italian Ardito and Aliseo, the Italian merchant ships Sassari and Humanitas, and a small German flotilla which included the submarine chasers UJ 2203 (former French Navy survey vessel Austral) and UJ 2219 (former Belgian yacht Insuma) and five Marinef√§hrprahme (F 366, F 387, F 459, F 612 and F 623).9 settembre 1943: l‚Äôimpresa dell‚ÄôAliseo The Cormorano was on watch off Bastia. The local Italian and German commanders soon reached a \\"gentlemen‚Äôs agreement\\" according to which the German forces would be allowed to safely retreat to mainland Italy. Meanwhile, however, the German forces secretly prepared to launch a surprise attack on the Italian ships moored inside the harbour, planning to capture them. The attack started at 23:45 on 8 September, when two groups of German soldiers, after hearing a whistle (the signal to attack), stormed Ardito; the torpedo boat was heavily damaged (70 of her 180 crew were killed) and captured, and the merchant ships Sassari and Humanitas also fell into German hands. On board Humanitas, German gunners manning the anti-aircraft guns turned their weapons on the Italian crew and soldiers aboard, and the Italian lookouts were stabbed or killed with hand grenades. Action Aliseo had just left the harbour when the German attack began. Shortly after dawn on 9 September, a combat group of the Tenth Bersaglieri Group (10¬∞ Raggruppamento Celere Bersaglieri) staged a counterattack which led to the recapture of the port. Ardito, Sassari and Humanitas were also recaptured. The German flotilla was ordered to leave the harbour, but as soon as they left, the ships were shelled by the Italian coastal batteries (armed with 76 mm guns), which damaged UJ 2203 and some of the MFPs. Aliseo (under the command of commander Carlo Fecia di Cossato) was then ordered by the port commander to attack and destroy the German units. Shortly after 7:00 the flotilla, proceeding in a column led by UJ 2203, opened fire on Aliseo, which returned fire at 7:06, from a distance of ; at 7:30 Aliseo was hit by an 88 mm shell in the engine room and temporarily left dead in the water, but the damage was quickly repaired and the torpedo boat closed in and engaged her adversaries in succession, destroying them one after the other. At 8:20 UJ 2203, after suffering several hits, blew up; ten minutes later UJ 2219 was also destroyed when her magazines exploded. Between 8:30 and 8:35 Aliseo also sank F 366, F 459 and F 623; Cormorano intervened during the final phase of the battle and, together with Aliseo, forced F 387 and F 612 to run aground, after which they were abandoned and destroyed.Historisches Marinearchiv ‚Äì F 612. Cormorano also sank the 43-ton Luftwaffe service motorboat FL B. 412. Twenty-five German survivors were picked up by Aliseo, which then (along with the damaged Ardito) proceeded towards Portoferraio, as ordered. The damage suffered by Ardito later caused this ship to be left behind in Portoferraio, where she was eventually captured by German forces. References Citations  Bibliography  * Vincent P.

Beauchamp and Joseph Hoffman. The film stars John Payne, Mari Blanchard, Dan Duryea, Joyce Mackenzie, Barton MacLane and Ralph Dumke. The film was released on April 14, 1954, by Universal Pictures. Plot In the Wyoming Territory during 1869, Union Army Sgt. Jefferson Harder enters a casino and, within minutes, instigates a brawl. Just as he is thrown through the window, the soldiers sent by Gen. Augur to bring Jeff back to the fort arrive. Back at the fort, Argur explains to the hot-headed officer that the construction of the cross-country railroad has been halted outside Laramie by Jim Shanessy, who runs the town and wants the crew to stay and spend their money at his hotel and casino. It is only the threat of the blockade that convinces Jeff to take the assignment. He is further annoyed when his arrival in Laramie is met with dismay from the chief railroad engineer, Lee Graham, Judge Pierce and Mayor Frank Logan, who expected him to bring troops. Graham, Pierce and Logan grow more aghast when Jeff warmly greets Shanessy, his childhood friend. Jim is at first pleased when Shanessy offers him free board at the hotel, but when the businessman's henchmen, brothers Con and Ace Winton, deliver a two-thousand dollar gift, Jeff recognizes it as a bribe. In the lobby, Jeff agrees to meet later that night with Pierce, who is still suspicious of him, and then visits the ineffectual but good-hearted marshal, Orrie Sommers, and advises him to ready the jail cells. At the casino soon after, Shanessy introduces Jeff to his partner, beautiful Lou Carter, but Jeff spurns Lou's advances and returns the money to Shanessy. Shanessy, who remains friendly even after Ace threatens Jeff and is beaten up in return, invites Jeff to his home, hoping that Jeff's lingering feelings for Shanessy's wife Helen will keep him from pursuing his new duties. Later, Jeff meets with Graham, Pierce and Logan, and then, armed with their promise of complete authority, visits the railroad work site, where the men are drinking, gambling and sleeping. After Jeff knocks out the brawny foreman, the other men back away, allowing him to shut down the makeshift saloon. The next day, however, when Jeff posts notices that all the men have been fired and construction suspended, both the workers and the town merchants complain bitterly. Graham calls a council meeting, at which some merchants demand Jeff's court-martial but, after he explains that he can rid the town of gambling and alcohol and only those who want to work will remain, they agree to give his plan a two- week trial. Shanessy counters by refusing to grant workers credit, and when they gather into an angry mob, as he has planned, he easily convinces them to wreak havoc on the town and defeat Jeff's plan. Jeff, however, arrests Shanessy, and that night, Lou invites Jeff to her room and, explaining that no local jury will convict Shanessy, offers to help. A mistrustful Jeff kisses her but then leaves. At the jail, Shanessy talks Jeff into visiting Helen, and when Jeff later leaves her house, too attracted to her to stay, he is beaten and deposited into a railroad car by Shanessy's men. In the morning, Jeff's absence results in a mistrial. Shanessy then instructs the workers to burn down all the railroad camps, after which every arrest Jeff makes is dismissed by crooked juries. He then sends for backup troops, but Shanessy shuts down the telegraph and, anticipating that Jeff will travel to see Augur himself, creates a landslide that blocks all traffic. Graham, Pierce and Logan insist that Jeff rehire the workers, and when he refuses, they send Orrie on horseback to Cheyenne to order Jeff court-martialed. Soon after, Jeff discovers that Orrie has been killed on the trail, and Lou informs him that Shanessy is the culprit, but the only way to convict him is to construct a jury out of the Wyoming women who have just been granted the right to vote. Still skeptical, Jeff visits Shanessy, and when Ace pulls out a gun, Jeff shoots him and arrests Shanessy again. This time, Lou sits as foreperson on the female jury, and, to Shanessy's shock, they find him guilty. Jeff thanks Lou afterward, and although she first spurns him, he grabs her and she falls into his arms. The night before Shanessy's scheduled hanging, Helen slips him a gun, and with it he knocks out Jeff and races to Lou's, shooting her in the back. Jeff revives and gathers a posse while Shanessy commandeers a train to Cheyenne, not realizing that the landslide has just been cleared on the tracks, and a passenger train is headed straight toward him. Jeff rides to Shanessy's train, leaps on and shoots his way to the front. There, with the passenger train fast approaching, he knocks out Shanessy and reverses the train only moments before a collision. Weeks later, railroad construction has resumed, and Jeff reports to a recovering Lou that although he must return to the Army for six months, he will consider Laramie his home base.

Pottery proves to be of most importance to the archaeological record. Pottery is durable and even allows its broken fragments to withstand time, which would otherwise decompose other artifacts. More importantly, the style of pottery often changes through time, and shifts in shape, size, or decoration can be used to resolve the age of the artifact and/or site. Furthermore, though pottery is common, different cultures had their own distinct styles that can be used to determine its similarities or differences with one another. Therefore, even fragments of pottery can reconstruct many facets of past cultures.  Kansyore Pottery  Throughout the ages, ceramics such as Kansyore pottery, have provided archaeologists the opportunity to study past cultures. Darla Dale and Ceri Z. Ashley state that, ‚Äú[archaeological] sites with Kansyore pottery are the only hunter-gatherer sites associated with large quantities of ceramics before the beginnings of food production in East Africa at 3000 to 2000 BC‚Äù. Evenmore, Dale and Ashley put forward earlier dates that ‚Äúsuggest they [are] among the earliest ceramic using hunter-gatherers in East Africa‚Äù. Their research suggests that the pottery is evidence of change. The investigation into Kansyore pottery is important because it adds a new perspective on alternative hunter-gather life ways. Research into Kansyore has provided a life-way that differs from other known East African Late Stone Age hunter-gatherers (LSA). The Kansyore communities of the LSA are marked with ceramics and a settlement pattern based on the exploitation of resources around the shoreline of lakes or rivers. Thus, the exploitation of marine resources fostered sedentism and the production of Kansyore pottery.  Geographic Distribution and Context  Kansyore ceramics have been found in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, southeastern Sudan). More specifically, this particular pottery is located around the Lake Victoria basin. Most sites associated with Kansyore pottery are nearby bodies of water, such rivers or lakes. For example, assemblages are ‚Äúloosely concentrated‚Äù around Lake Victoria. To list a few areas and sites: *Gogo Falls, Kenya. *Usenge, Kenya. *Siror, Kenya. *northern Tanzania. The concentration of Kansyore pottery in geographical areas associated with water suggests something about the hunter- gatherer's lifeways. This settlement pattern suggests a specialized subsistence economy based on aquatic food. Furthermore, the subsistence strategy of fish and shellfish is the result of seasonal exploitation of food sources: * River sites were exploited for fishing during the wet season. * Lake sites were exploited during the dry season for the collection of shellfish and easily caught fish. Typology: Description of Pottery Kansyore pottery's uniqueness is a result of applied tools and techniques. This caused the design of the pottery to display distinct decorations that covered most of the exterior surface. The vessels themselves run a spectrum from medium-sized to hemispherical bowls with varying rim designs, such as rounded, tapered, and occasionally spurred. To classify, Dale developed an approach to identify Kansyore pottery: *Four techniques: appliqu√©, incision, rocker, and simple impression. *Eight motifs: serrated-edge, serrated-edge zigzag, plain-edge zigzag, punctate, punctate circular motif, appliqu√©, incision, and impression. Within each of these categories certain techniques were applied to achieve the desired design. For example, in the appliqu√© technique clay pieces were attached to the clay body in circular or oblong shapes, yet within the motifs categories were many variations.  Gogo Falls Collection  The Kansyore collection from Gogo Falls is the largest known example of well-preserved Kansyore pottery, and it has been used as a reference for comparisons. Collett and Robertshaw applied the Kansyore collection from Gogo Falls to resolve classification issues with ceramics from Kantsyore Island, Nyang'oma, and Mumba-Hohle. * Kantsyore Island. ** All the sherds from Kantsyore Island depicted the same style as the collection from Gogo Falls. * Nyang' oma. ** All of the sherds can be assigned to the Kansyore assemblage. * Mumba Hohle. ** Because some the pottery includes different stylistic qualities, such as aereal motifs, only some of the pottery, that depict panels and multiple bands of vertical punctates, may belong in the Kansyore tradition. Thus, the ceramic assemblages found at the sites stated above belong to the Kansyore tradition. This cannot be said for other ceramic assemblages. For instance, it was believed that Kansyore pottery was discovered at the Lukenya Hill and Salasun sites. However, Collett and Robertshaw used the Gogo Falls collection as a reference, and were able to subscribe the ceramics in the central Rift Valley to the Nderit tradition. * Lukenya Hill. ** Ceramics depicted either a dragged comb or twisted cordroulette style that does not match the Kansyore tradition. * Salasun. ** The Salasun assemblage has not been fully described, though at least part of the assemblage has been assigned to the Nderit tradition. The above-mentioned comparisons show that some assemblages have been wrongly identified as the Kansyore entity.  Associations and Non-Ceramic Artifacts  Significant non- ceramic artifacts found associated with Kansyore pottery are: * Shell middens * Personal adornment at Usenge, Pundo, and Siror * Rounded pebble at Pundo * Lithics * Bone points  Associated ceramic artifacts  * Urewe ware * Early Iron Age ceramic * Nderit The fact that Kansyore pottery was found in varying contexts and with other artifacts illustrates transition and change. This is seen in the Early Phase of the Kansyore. To illustrate, 8 rounded pebbles were found in one test pit at Pundo, their function range from grinding red ochre to grinding plants. Bone points used for fishing were discovered at Usenge 1 and Pundo, and personal adornment, such as bone or shell beads, were found at Usenge 1, Pundo, and Siror. Thus, the non-ceramic artifacts indicate that specialized materials were already being made before the introduction of pottery.  Chronology  The chronology for Kansyore has been a source of discourse for many archaeologists. Dates for Kansyore cover 6000 years with the earliest dates, 7819 to 6590 cal. BC, coming from Luanda in Kenya, while the latest dates, AD 1-120, coming from Wadh Lang'o.  Discussing Chronology and typology  The overbearing time frame of the dates briefed above has caused many to question the validity of the Kansyore tradition. D.P Collett and P.T. Robertshaw assert that \\"dates associated with Kansyore assemblages cover a long period.\\" Their recounting of Mehlmans' skepticism, however, results from the fact that \\"either a very conservative tradition or large dating errors\\" disallow for accurate chronology. Evidence suggest that the former reasoning is the cause for the chronology, and the dating for Kansyore pottery from East Africa suggest that it was a long lived tradition. Chronology is important to Dale's and Ashley's research. With their findings, they were able to ascertain two phases of the Kansyore tradition. First is the Early Phase, which was 5468-5299 cal. BC. Second is the Late Terminal Kansyore Phase, which dates to the mid-second millennium BC and terminal second early first millennia cal BC. The Early Phase is illustrated at sites such as Siror, Pundo, and Usenge 1. In Siror dated material corroborate with Dale's and Ashley's sequence of the Early Phase. For example, a radiocarbon date of charcoal, found in Trench 1, is dated to 5468-5299 BC. The typology of ceramics found in the Early phase at Siror is the punctate motif, while the Late Terminal phase shows a high frequency of the rocker- stamp motif. The Late Terminal Kansyore Phase is identified at Usenge 3 and Trench 2 in Siror. Again, artifacts radiocarbon dates, ranging from 3310 +/1 40 BP and 3240 +/- 70 BP, supports Dale's sequence of the Kansyore tradition. Missing in the sequence is a phase for the middle Kansyore period because more research is needed to develop a full picture of change, yet the dating provided by the sequence allows reconstruction of the Kansyore tradition.  Life ways of the Early and Late Kansyore phases.  The above-mentioned sections illustrate the amount of research into the Kansyore tradition. Research into the Kansyore has provided more insight into the lifeways of those who created the pottery. Artifacts, such as pottery, in which the originators are no longer tangible entities, allow archaeologists the ability to interpret it. Dale and Ashley illustrate the difference between Early and Late Kansyore by using ceramic and non-ceramic archaeological material from Siror, and at the same time speak about the culture of the pottery makers. Thus, in the early phase of Siror, the large quantities of fish bones suggest that many people whom had a fish-based subsistence economy occupied the site. As stated above, ceramic evidence at the early phase was punctate, but shifted to rocker-stamped motif in the later Kansyore period. With the shift in ceramic decoration, more emphasis on terrestrial mammals for subsistence became apparent. The transition to the use of ceramics was not a swift transition. In fact, evidence shows that ceramic use was slowly applied and may have come after specialized subsistence economies. For instance, shell middens in Usenge 1 and Pundo show low ceramic density. Even more, non-ceramic artifacts, such as bone points, indicate that other material culture linked to specific activities and economies existed before ceramics. Nonetheless, even if the transition to ceramic use was slow and part of a process of change, by the Early Kansyore Phase, 5648-5299 cal. BC, it became a central part of the economy. Evidence for a shift in subsistence economy and social relations in the Later Terminal Kansyore Phase is seen in Siror and Usenge 3. At these sites a decline of fish resource exploitation is experienced and a rise in terrestrial mammals is emphasized. For example, in Usenge 3 the upper layers of deposit including terrestrial animals, such as cattle, overlaid a Kansyore shell midden. In addition to the terrestrial animals, the Kansyore ceramics in the upper layers of deposit depicted a decline in decoration and technological quality. This is taken as evidence for social contact with late hunter-gather- fishers and farming societies. Thus, in the Later Terminal Kansyore Phase, the fishing to hunting society was going through a local change brought on by contact with other societies.

Location The Thorne and Hatfield Moors are within the Humberhead Levels and form part of the largest raised peat mire in England. The sites are well known for their ecological significance nationally and internationally, and there are long-term management plans underway to begin to restore the peat. The rarity and importance of the ecological qualities of the site coincide with the age of the peatland and retrospective historical archaeological features, which have yet to be fully discovered, although recent excavations over the last 40 years have led to the significant finds of a Bronze Age trackway and most recently the Lindholme Neolithic Trackway, sometimes referred to as the Oliver Track after its discoverer. Hatfield and Thorne Moors are currently using conservation and management strategies to produce positive outcomes for the niche environments of the peat, the archaeological assets and ecologies with the aim to create a working balance between the different requirements.. History of the archaeology on the site Since the 1700s there has been considerable antiquarian interest in Thorne and Hatfield Moors. Literature shows throughout history that locals have taken an interest in the ancient charred cut wood stumps that began to appear from the peat extraction process'.Abraham de Pryme 1701 cited in Buckland (1979). Thorne Moors: A Palaeological Study of a Bronze Age Site: A contribution of the history of the British Insect fauna The earliest reference to archaeological records was by Abraham De la Pryme (1701) who noted the finding of bog oaks and Roman coins and as well as an assumed bog body from the region. One of the most notable antiquarian source for the site is Hunter who gives a detailed description of the local histories and tales of the area, including an unproven find of a bog body in Hatfield.Hunter (1828). Classical Country Histories: South Yorkshire, republished (1974)EP Publishing John Tomlinson focused on the drainage and history of the region recording finds and the existence of the 15th century hermitage on Lindholme Island at the centre of Hatfield Moors.Tomlinson (1882) cited by Chapman and Geary (2014).Modelling Archaeology and Paleoenvironments in Wetlands There are several antiquarian sources for Thorne regarding the discoveries of Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age finds; which include early Bronze Age flints, Mesolithic Tranchet Axe, Neolithic Flint Flake, Mesolithic Flint Scatter, Neolithic Stone Axe, Palaeolithic burnin and many more.South Yorkshire HERThe Yorkshire Archaeological Journal (1973/4). VOL 45/46 The Yorkshire Philosophical Society Annual Report of 1862 mentions the discovery of an undated sword within the Hatfield Chase region although a more specific location is unknown, the sword is believed to reside in the Yorkshire Museum donated by W. Coulman The Bronze Age Trackway was discovered in 1972 after findings from Turner.1965 cited in Buckland (1979). Thorne Moors: A Palaeological Study of a Bronze Age Site: A contribution of the history of the British Insect fauna Pollen analysis evidenced small temporary wood clearance during the Bronze Age that warranted investigation. The investigation revealed rough timbers of various sizes placed side by side to create a trackway. It is thought the trackway was created during primary phase forest clearance and in part due to the contemporary widespread flooding of the local area.Buckland (1979). Thorne Moors: A Palaeological Study of a Bronze Age Site: A contribution of the history of the British Insect fauna The most recent find on Hatfield Moor is the Lindholme Neolithic Trackway discovered in 2004. The corduroy trackway has an average width of 3 m, but is 4 m wide in one area with rails positioned 1.9 m ‚Äì 2.1 m apart. The trackway dates to approximately to 2900-2500 BC. Additionally it is the only site of its kind to be constructed of pine, which is a reflection of the local availability of this tree. It is thought the trackway was constructed in the earliest stages of peat growth in the area and as such is most likely a direct response to the swamping of a local routeway.Chapman and Geary (2005). A Neolithic Trackway on Hatfield Moors ‚Äì a significant discovery, , [PDF], accessed 7 December 2015University of Birmingham (2015).Hatfield Trackway and Platform, Hatfield Moors, South Yorkshire, http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/caha/news/projects/environmental/hatfield.aspx, [www.doc], accessed 7 December 2015 The Lindholme trackway was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument by Historic England in 2017 Palaeoenvironmental research The moors have been the focus of vast palaeo-environmental studies with some results published in journals, reports or monograph form. Palynological and coleopteran analyses account for most of the work on both moors to date, with significant plant macrofossil, peat humification and testate amoebae studies also included. There are limited micromorphological analysis' regarding the interface between the pre-peat-land-surfaces and the base of the peat on the moors- primarily aimed at identifying evidence for the disturbance caused by forest clearance, ploughing, and other human activity enabling a comparison to be made. The results did not give a conclusive answer regarding the relationships between the two, however cryoturbation structures were discovered on Hatfield Moor indicating the freezing and thawing groundwater during the Devensian. It also identified well-developed soil horizons beneath the peat on the northern side of the Lindholme ridge. Thorne Moor showed evidence of faunal activity prior to the peat formation, as part of soils were able to support deciduous woodland prior to peat growth. There have been analysis of the palynological sequences for Thorne Moor as well as radiocarbon dating for the pollen sequencing (and humification, plant macrossil and testate amoebae). Hatfield has seen more detailed research on Coleoptera in the form of complete sequences supported by radiocarbon dating There has been considerable contribution to the understanding of the palaeoenvironment of Hatfield and Thorne Moors- however the full potential of these surveys is to some extent restricted due to an incomplete understanding of the landscape context of the various sampling sites. There is a strong archaeological record of both peatlands from antiquarian sources which provide evidence of human activity within the area but there is a lack of surviving, material where the source is identified. The damage caused by the peat extraction may contribute to the lack of finds most recently however it may be because of lack of human presence. However, despite the effect of drainage and cutting the area still hold the potential for preservation of organic material, including archaeological features and artefacts.Coles and Coles 1996 cited in Chapman and Geary (2014)Modelling Archaeology and Paleoenvironments in Wetlands Other sources * The Peatlands Way (2015). * Hatfield and Thorne Conservation Forum (2015). * History of Thorne (2015).

University of Michigan, n.d. Web. 04 Dec. 2015. A number of those who enroll into English immersion programs are immigrant children.Hiller, Jennifer. \\"Schools See More Students with Limited English Skills.\\" Honolulu Advertiser Sep 07 2003. ProQuest. Web. 4 Dec. 2015. Due to the fact that more ambitious choices are made by immigrant students than nonimmigrant students regarding academic choices, secondary effects, such as these English immersion programs, create positive outcomes. Immigrant children is defined as children who have at least one foreign born parent. Some immigrant students show proficiency in English after being in the program for only 2‚Äì3 years while others take longer. There are not many other resources provided by schools that students can go to if they want to learn or improve their English. As a result, it can possibly affect immigrant students' proficiency in English.  Background  There are two types of English immersion programs: 1) structured, 2) submersion. Structured immersion programs help students focus on building a vocabulary. This type of program help the students to learn English faster so that they will be able to join the regular classes with the majority of their classmates. Submersion-type immersion programs is a sink or swim kind of program. This type of immersion does not provide the student with any kind of assistance. It is up to the student's ability to learn and understand the language on their own. Most immersion programs have students focus on developing English proficiency only. English immersion programs do this by having the students be exposed to the language directly.  Increasing immigrant student population  With an increase in the immigrant student population, English immersion resources help immigrant students adjust to the U.S. In public elementary schools, they have seen a new rise in immigrant enrollment. \\"In the 10 years between 1996 and 2006, the number of ELL students enrolled in U.S. elementary and secondary schools has grown approximately 57 percent, while the general school population has grown only 3.7 percent\\".Sheng, Zhaohui, Sheng, Yanyan, and Anderson, Christine J. \\"Dropping out of School among ELL Students: Implications to Schools and Teacher Education.\\" The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas 84.3 (2011): 98-103. Web. 4 Dec. 2015. The population of ELL students has grown really big throughout the years. With current increasing immigration and birth rates of immigrant children, the ELL student population in U.S. elementary schools will get even bigger.  Not enough resources currently available  There aren't many English immersion resources that are available for immigrant students. The most common English immersion program is ESL. The ESL program is a submersion-type of English immersion. The program is for students whose main language is not English. The goal of the program is to increase students' English proficiency so that they can meet academic standards and do well in classrooms.\\"English as a Second Language (ESL).\\" Pittsburgh Public Schools. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Dec. 2015. In California, twenty-five percent of the student population in all public schools are in the ESL program. The Census Bureau claims there was about 31.8 million individuals whose primary language was not English in 1990. In the year 2000, it rose to 47 million, which is 18% of the population.Kim, Yoon Kyong, et al. ‚ÄúBilingual Education in the United States: An Historical Overview and Examination of Two- Way Immersion.‚Äù Educational Review, vol. 67, no. 2, May 2015, pp. 236‚Äì252. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1080/00131911.2013.865593. Also, in the United States, there are more than 3.7 million public-school students whose English proficiency is limited, and similar to the Census Bureau, the number will rise. Immigrant students' success or failure in school depends on the kind of assistance they receive. ELL students constantly have lower scores in reading and mathematics than their non-ELL peers. An article showed that there is a relationship between poor academic achievement and high dropout rates. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) hold schools responsible for their students' academic achievement.Abedi, Jamal. \\"The No Child Left Behind Act and English Language Learners: Assessment and Accountability Issues.\\" Educational Researcher 33.1 (2004): 4. Web. 4 Dec. 2015.  Improved English proficiency  In a study about the benefits of a second-language immersion elementary school program, the findings showed positive results. The participants that were involved were 106 French-speaking eight-year-old children. They were separated into two groups. 53 children who were enrolled in English immersion classes since when they were five years old were classified in one group. The second group is 53 children who were enrolled in monolingual classes. Results showed that the kids who were enrolled in English immersion classes gained some cognitive benefits such as auditory selective attention, divided attention, and mental flexibility.Nicolay, Anne-Catherine, and Poncelet, Martine. \\"Cognitive Advantage in Children Enrolled in a Second-Language Immersion Elementary School Program for Three Years. \\"Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 16.3 (2013): 597-607. Web. 4 Dec. 2015. In another study about the effectiveness of two-year oral English programs conducted on 534 Hispanic ELL students, it was concluded that English immersion programs are needed to accelerate oral English acquisition.Tong, Fuhui, Lara-Alecio, Rafael, Irby, Beverly, Mathes, Patricia, and Kwok, Oi-man. \\"Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs.\\" American Educational Research Journal 45.4 (2008): 1011-044. Print.  Alternatives to ESL Programs  Although ESL (English as a Second Language) programs are much more common in the United States, many studies have found that dual language education is more effective in closing the achievement gap for students who are learning English as a second language. ‚ÄúWith respect to the ultimate goal for ELs [English Learners], the policy of transitional bilingual education, or ESL programs whose aims are English language proficiency and assimilation, is explicitly non-bilingual‚Äù (Iliana & Rodriguez, 2008). While conducting many different studies in 15 different states in both large and small school districts, Collier and Thomas (2004) found that dual language education is the only way for English learners to close the achievement gap. ESL programs separate students from mainstream classrooms. ‚ÄúEnglish learner programs often place students in modified instruction, which translates to less linguistically and academically rigorous instruction than mainstream instruction,‚Äù (Callahan, 2016). Alternatively, dual language programs keep students together and allow all students to become fluent in both languages. While this may seem like an ideal solution, there is one notable conflict: not all ESL students speak one common language. It would be nearly impossible to offer dual language programs in the first language of every student in the school. This being said, it is still important to note that many immigrant students do share a common language in certain areas. For example, in states like California and Texas that are very close to the Mexican border, Spanish is the most popular language among immigrant students. In these areas it could be very beneficial for Spanish-speaking students to have dual language programs.  Controversy  Some people criticize that it is costly to offer a variety of English immersion resources. For example, for just the ESL program, \\"...38% of eligible Texas students are served in ESL programs and are the most expensive to operate since ESL teachers must be hired to attend to pull-out students\\".Lara-Alecio, Rafael, Martha Galloway, Lakshmi Mahadevan, Ben Mason, Beverly J. Irby, Genevieve Brown, and Leo G√≥mez. \\"Texas Dual Language Program Cost Analysis.\\" The TABE Journal (2004): 9-10. Web. 4 Dec. 2015. Training for regular teachers may also need to be provided so that they are qualified to teach ESL students. An ESL Generalist certification is required to teach in the ESL program. The average cost for a student in ESL is $2,687.Parrish, Thomas B.. \\"A Cost Analysis of Alternative Instructional Models for Limited English Proficient Students in California\\". Journal of Education Finance 19.3 (1994): 263. Web. 4 Dec. 2015. Along with the cost of these resources, another criticism of these English immersion resources is that they do not support most of these ELL students. Some of these ELL students do not even receive specialized language services in their schools, specifically 11.7% of ELL students.

Trigonometric quantities   Classical trigonometric quantities  The following are trigonometric quantities generally associated to a general tetrahedron: * The 6 edge lengths - associated to the six edges of the tetrahedron. * The 12 face angles - there are three of them for each of the four faces of the tetrahedron. * The 6 dihedral angles - associated to the six edges of the tetrahedron, since any two faces of the tetrahedron are connected by an edge. * The 4 solid angles - associated to each point of the tetrahedron. Let X = \\\\overline{P_1P_2P_3P_4} be a general tetrahedron, where P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4 are arbitrary points in three-dimensional space. Furthermore, let e_{ij} be the edge that joins P_{i} and P_{j} and let F_{i} be the face of the tetrahedron opposite the point P_{i}; in other words: * e_{ij}=\\\\overline{P_iP_j} * F_i = \\\\overline{P_jP_kP_l} where i,j,k,l \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\\\\\} and i eq j eq k eq l. Define the following quantities: * d_{ij} = the length of the edge e_{ij} * \\\\alpha_{i,j} = the angle spread at the point P_i on the face F_{j} * \\\\theta_{ij} = the dihedral angle between two faces adjacent to the edge e_{ij} * \\\\Omega_i = the solid angle at the point P_i  Area and volume  Let \\\\Delta_i be the area of the face F_i. Such area may be calculated by Heron's formula (if all three edge lengths are known): : \\\\Delta_i = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(d_{jk}+d_{jl}+d_{kl})(-d_{jk}+d_{jl}+d_{kl})(d_{jk}-d_{jl}+d_{kl})(d_{jk}+d_{jl}-d_{kl})}{16}} or by the following formula (if an angle and two corresponding edges are known): : \\\\Delta_i = \\\\frac{1}{2}d_{jk} d_{jl}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{j,i} Let h_i be the altitude from the point P_{i} to the face F_{i}. The volume V of the tetrahedron X is given by the following formula: V = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\Delta_{i}h_{i}It satisfies the following relation: : 288V^2 = \\\\begin{vmatrix} 2Q_{12} & Q_{12}+Q_{13}-Q_{23} & Q_{12}+Q_{14}-Q_{24} \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_{12}+Q_{13}-Q_{23} & 2Q_{13} & Q_{13}+Q_{14}-Q_{34} \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_{12}+Q_{14}-Q_{24} & Q_{13}+Q_{14}-Q_{34} & 2Q_{14} \\\\end{vmatrix} where Q_{ij} = d_{ij}^2 are the quadrances (length squared) of the edges.  Basic statements of trigonometry   Affine triangle  Take the face F_{i}; the edges will have lengths d_{jk},d_{jl},d_{kl} and the respective opposite angles are given by \\\\alpha_{l,i},\\\\alpha_{k,i},\\\\alpha_{j,i}. The usual laws for planar trigonometry of a triangle hold for this triangle.  Projective triangle  Consider the projective (spherical) triangle at the point P_i; the vertices of this projective triangle are the three lines that join P_i with the other three vertices of the tetrahedron. The edges will have spherical lengths \\\\alpha_{i,j},\\\\alpha_{i,k},\\\\alpha_{i,l} and the respective opposite spherical angles are given by \\\\theta_{ij},\\\\theta_{ik},\\\\theta_{il}. The usual laws for spherical trigonometry hold for this projective triangle.  Laws of trigonometry for the tetrahedron  Alternating sines theorem Take the tetrahedron X, and consider the point P_i as an apex. The Alternating sines theorem is given by the following identity:\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{j,l})\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{k,j})\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{l,k}) = \\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{j,k})\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{k,l})\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_{l,j})One may view the two sides of this identity as corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise orientations of the surface.  The space of all shapes of tetrahedra  248px Putting any of the four vertices in the role of O yields four such identities, but at most three of them are independent; if the \\"clockwise\\" sides of three of the four identities are multiplied and the product is inferred to be equal to the product of the \\"counterclockwise\\" sides of the same three identities, and then common factors are cancelled from both sides, the result is the fourth identity. Three angles are the angles of some triangle if and only if their sum is 180¬∞ (œÄ radians). What condition on 12 angles is necessary and sufficient for them to be the 12 angles of some tetrahedron? Clearly the sum of the angles of any side of the tetrahedron must be 180¬∞. Since there are four such triangles, there are four such constraints on sums of angles, and the number of degrees of freedom is thereby reduced from 12 to 8. The four relations given by the sine law further reduce the number of degrees of freedom, from 8 down to not 4 but 5, since the fourth constraint is not independent of the first three. Thus the space of all shapes of tetrahedra is 5-dimensional.  Law of sines for the tetrahedron  See: Law of sines  Law of cosines for the tetrahedron  The law of cosines for the tetrahedron relates the areas of each face of the tetrahedron and the dihedral angles about a point. It is given by the following identity: : \\\\Delta_i^2 = \\\\Delta_j^2 + \\\\Delta_k^2 + \\\\Delta_l^2 - 2(\\\\Delta_{j}\\\\Delta_{k}\\\\cos\\\\theta_{il} + \\\\Delta_j \\\\Delta_l \\\\cos\\\\theta_{ik}+\\\\Delta_k \\\\Delta_l \\\\cos\\\\theta_{ij})  Relationship between dihedral angles of tetrahedron  Take the general tetrahedron X and project the faces F_i,F_j,F_k onto the plane with the face F_l. Let c_{ij} = \\\\cos\\\\theta_{ij}. Then the area of the face F_l is given by the sum of the projected areas, as follows:\\\\Delta_l = \\\\Delta_ic_{jk} + \\\\Delta_jc_{ik} + \\\\Delta_kc_{ij}By substitution of i,j,k,l \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\\\\\} with each of the four faces of the tetrahedron, one obtains the following homogeneous system of linear equations:\\\\begin{cases} -\\\\Delta_1 + \\\\Delta_2c_{34} + \\\\Delta_3c_{24} + \\\\Delta_4c_{23} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_1c_{34} - \\\\Delta_2 + \\\\Delta_3c_{14} + \\\\Delta_4c_{13} = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_1c_{24} + \\\\Delta_2c_{14} - \\\\Delta_3 + \\\\Delta_4c_{12} = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_1c_{23} + \\\\Delta_2c_{13} + \\\\Delta_3c_{12} - \\\\Delta_4 = 0 \\\\end{cases}This homogeneous system will have solutions precisely when: \\\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & c_{34} & c_{24} & c_{23} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{34} & -1 & c_{14} & c_{13} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{24} & c_{14} & -1 & c_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{23} & c_{13} & c_{12} & -1 \\\\end{vmatrix} = 0By expanding this determinant, one obtains the relationship between the dihedral angles of the tetrahedron, as follows: 1-\\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq 4}c^{2}_{ij}+\\\\sum_{j=2\\\\atop k eq l eq j}^{4}c^{2}_{1j}c^{2}_{kl} = 2\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1\\\\atop j eq k eq l eq i}^{4}c_{ij}c_{ik}c_{il}+\\\\sum_{2\\\\leq j  Skew distances between edges of tetrahedron  Take the general tetrahedron X and let P_{ij} be the point on the edge e_{ij} and P_{kl} be the point on the edge e_{kl} such that the line segment \\\\overline{P_{ij}P_{kl}} is perpendicular to both e_{ij} & e_{kl}. Let R_{ij} be the length of the line segment \\\\overline{P_{ij}P_{kl}}. To find R_{ij}: First, construct a line through P_{k} parallel to e_{il} and another line through P_{i} parallel to e_{kl}. Let O be the intersection of these two lines. Join the points O and P_{j}. By construction, \\\\overline{OP_iP_lP_k} is a parallelogram and thus \\\\overline{OP_kP_i} and \\\\overline{OP_lP_i} are congruent triangles. Thus, the tetrahedron X and Y = \\\\overline{OP_iP_jP_k} are equal in volume. As a consequence, the quantity R_{ij} is equal to the altitude from the point P_{k} to the face \\\\overline{OP_iP_j} of the tetrahedron Y; this is shown by translation of the line segment \\\\overline{P_{ij}P_{kl}}. By the volume formula, the tetrahedron Y satisfies the following relation: 3V = R_{ij} \\\\times \\\\Delta(\\\\overline{OP_iP_j})where \\\\Delta(\\\\overline{OP_iP_j}) is the area of the triangle \\\\overline{OP_iP_j}. Since the length of the line segment \\\\overline{OP_i} is equal to d_{kl} (as \\\\overline{OP_iP_lP_k} is a parallelogram): \\\\Delta(\\\\overline{OP_iP_j}) = \\\\frac{1}{2}d_{ij}d_{kl}\\\\sin\\\\lambdawhere \\\\lambda = \\\\angle OP_iP_j.

The sides are given by \\\\alpha_{i,l},\\\\alpha_{k,j},\\\\lambda and the only known opposite angle is that of \\\\lambda, given by \\\\pi - \\\\theta_{ik}. By the spherical law of cosines:\\\\cos\\\\lambda = \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,l}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_{k,j}-\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,l}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{k,j}\\\\cos\\\\theta_{ik} Combining the two equations gives the following result:\\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,k}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{k,j} + \\\\cos\\\\lambda\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,j} = \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,l}\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,j}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{k,j} + \\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,j}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_{k,j}\\\\right) =\\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,l}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{l,j} Making \\\\cos\\\\lambda the subject:\\\\cos\\\\lambda = \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,l}\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{l,j}}{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,j}} - \\\\cos\\\\alpha_{i,k}\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{k,j}}{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_{i,j}}Thus, using the cosine law and some basic trigonometry:\\\\cos\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{d_{ij}^2+d_{ik}^2-d_{jk}^2}{2d_{ij}d_{ik}}\\\\frac{d_{ik}}{d_{kl}} \\\\- \\\\frac{d_{ij}^2+d_{il}^2-d_{jl}^2}{2d_{ij}d_{il}}\\\\frac{d_{il}}{d_{kl}} = \\\\frac{d_{ik}^2+d_{jl}^2-d_{il}^2-d_{jk}^2}{2d_{ij}d_{kl}}Thus:\\\\sin\\\\lambda = \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{d_{ik}^2+d_{jl}^2-d_{il}^2-d_{jk}^2}{2d_{ij}d_{kl}}\\\\right)^2} =\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{4d_{ij}^2d_{kl}^2-(d_{ik}^2+d_{jl}^2-d_{il}^2-d_{jk}^2)^2}}{2d_{ij}d_{kl}}So:R_{ij} = \\\\frac{12V}{\\\\sqrt{4d_{ij}^2d_{kl}^2-(d_{ik}^2+d_{jl}^2-d_{il}^2-d_{jk}^2)^2}}R_{ik} and R_{il} are obtained by permutation of the edge lengths. Note that the denominator is a re-formulation of the Bretschneider-von Staudt formula, which evaluates the area of a general convex quadrilateral.

Ochs and Capps examine tellability as the reason a narrative is told. Namely speakers can transform any instance into a meaningful narrative, but most are tellable due to how they deviate from everyday happenings and the prototypical.Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. Untold Stories. 2001. A narrative changes dependent on its level of tellability, and these elements are largely contextual. The tellability of a story often parallels the perceived truth of the story.  Context and Framing  The tellability of a narrative changes and is dependent on the audience, the content, the narrator, and more. This aspect of tellability directly thinks to Erving Goffman's concept of Framing in his book Frame Analysis. Framing is the circumstances and tone by which any interaction is made, whether it be more of a sociable or professional frame changes the content of the interaction.Erving Goffman. The Frame Analysis of Talk. 1974. According to this certain stories are more significant and appropriate in different social frames in comparison to others. Different frames change the tellability of a story and the means by which that story would be told.  Truth  The tellability of a story is influenced by the search for truth within the narrative, and this largely changes the story to reflect that truth to the audience. For a story to be tellable it must be believable to those listening. People are more willing to accept stories as true when they are more factual and not discouraging to their sense of security and comfort. Because of this speakers often have to reframe their narratives in order to have other people believe them, especially in different socio-political circumstances. Amy Shuman studies how narratives change in different contexts, and she specifically does research with asylum seekers. Shuman finds that, for a narrative to be believable, it must have an experience that has been told before, but it also must not be too common or people will see it as unremarkable or even just a copy of another's personal experience.Amy Shuman. Representing Trauma: Political Asylum Narrative. 2004. Because of this, while the narrator may have most control over the telling of the narrative, the believability of it is often up to the empathy and willingness of the audience, and so narratives are often constructed with the thought of the audience in mind. This is similar to the Heisenberg effect, wherein the very act of there being a different audience greatly changes the narrative at hand. Yet truth within a narrative is often not solely reflective of objective truth. Truth is often a reflection of the emotional response of the speaker from their story or it can be honing in on a particular element of the story.  Narrative Construction  A key aspect of tellability is authenticity. Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps both examine tellability of a narrative, and they find that the balance of the narrative's authenticity and aesthetic is what allows for the content to have a believable narrative structure and therefore makes it tellable.Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. Untold Stories. 2001. Authenticity is the objective truth of the account being detailed in the narrative. Authenticity often takes on a linear structure, as it reflects the cause and effect relationship and temporal sequencing of the events that transpire. The aesthetic quality is the change in the narrative that the speaker adds to it, so that the narrative will feel more genuine in how personal it is. Aesthetic may change the structure by which the story is told so to reflect the emotional response of the narrator as well as highlight the aspect most important to the narrator. A story's tellability is directly linked to its balance between authenticity and aesthetic, as the story must be both personal and factual in how it presents its truth. Folklorists often find that truth is the means by which tellability is implemented in the story, so tellability is to give an understanding as to whether the truth is an objective or subjective matter.  Chaotic Narrative  In certain circumstances the tellability of the narrative is created through how unbelievable it is, this is commonly happens with the chaotic narrative. The chaotic narrative is told loosely and fragmented as it is the only way the speaker can remember and retell certain traumatic events. While a linear story allows for a show of temporal sequencing and signifies a more objective perspective, the chaotic narrative's unorganized and seemingly disordered sequencing reflects the believability of the story due to the sheer emotional reaction of the speaker. Yet some chaotic narratives are untellable simply because the speaker cannot bring themselves to relive those moments. Diane Goldstein studies the chaotic narrative in trauma stories and how their tellability fluctuates.Diane Goldstien. Rethinking Ventriloquism: Untellability, Chaotic Narratives, Social Justice, and the Choice to Speak For, About, and Without. 2012. The chaotic narrative is usually used with trauma stories, as the narrator is still deeply affected by the content and can only remember certain aspects of the story. While the speaker's retelling of the events may not be perfectly true to everything that happened, the chaotic story is told in this fashion because of how severe the memory is to the speaker. Therefore, the story may come out disjointed and focusing on minute details, as that is how the narrator remembers it to be.  Memory  Memory plays a major role in the tellability of a story, as memories are constantly changing and the lack of memory can often impede on the tellability of a story. In Untold Stories, Ochs and Capps detail the major role that memory plays in tellability.Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. Untold Stories. 2001. They explain that as people grow older their memories of the past change and therefore the very means by which the story changes. Some stories lose tellability as they are forgotten, others lose tellability in how the memory of them are so fragmented that they cannot be told as a story. In other instances people grow so far away from these certain memories that they no longer seem applicable or important to tell.  Reasons to Tell a Story  Tellability is also largely defined by the reasons for which a person chooses to tell a story. Some stories lack tellability for moral reasons, such as people not wanting to concern others with what they have experienced or to not hurt a listener's feelings. Goldstein examines the foreknowledge and hindsight of telling a story in the wake of a major event.Diane Goldstien. The Sounds of Silence: Foreknowledge, Miracles, Suppressed Narratives, and Terrorism‚ÄîWhat Not Telling Might Tell Us. 2009. In her research she finds that people may make stories of small coincidences in the aftermath of a great public trauma so to create more drama. People may want to feel security in knowing that whatever events are meant to transpire give their warnings and can be controlled, so people create narratives out of foreknowledge wherein it singles out an enemy for which people can put the blame on, and it makes the events feel more orderly. While stories can lack tellability due to their believability or their relevance, some stories are untellable as they perpetuate stereotypes and create a power dynamic. Goldstein examines tellability through ventriloquism wherein someone who holds more social influence and privilege tries to tell the story of people less fortunate.Diane Goldstien. The Sounds of Silence: Foreknowledge, Miracles, Suppressed Narratives, and Terrorism‚ÄîWhat Not Telling Might Tell Us. 2009. In doing so these retellings lack tellability as they influence the perspective of people who are not the speaker and perpetuate stereotypes, as the speaker is not able to capture the authenticity of the experiences these other people have had. Telling the story of another person or community can be tellable, so long as it is not done to speak for them but rather to reflect on the speaker and to show what they gain from looking at these narratives.

During his youth he engaged in several spiritual practices, which led him to have mystical experiences that culminated with the experience of oneness with the absolute in November 1985. From then on he began to write and teach about spiritual matters. In the 1990s he published detailed descriptions of the major mystical traditions of the world, the synthesis of which he called Mysticosofia. His aim was to show that all major mystical traditions seek, through various practices, to help a person advance via two major routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness, and the creation of the body of light. In 2014 he founded the ashram known as Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos (House of the Four Directions), near the city of Atlixco, Puebla, which offers courses and retreats. He has published over fifty books. Hundreds of his lectures are available for free on YouTube. He lives in Puebla, with his wife Ruth and his sons Andr√©s and Diego.  Childhood and adolescence: 1956‚Äì1977  Jose Antonio Ramon Calder√≥n was born in Puebla, Mexico, on August 15, 1956, to an upper- class family. He was the third of the six children of Casiano Ram√≥n P√©rez and Mar√≠a Trinidad Calderon Tell. During his dissolute adolescence he felt an increasingly growing inner emptiness, which led him on an intense spiritual search and, eventually, to meeting his spiritual teacher. For a short period of time he studied Anthropology at the Universidad Iberoamericana, but soon quit to dedicate himself fully to his spiritual practices.  Discipleship and spiritual awakening: 1977‚Äì1985  On July 7, 1977, Shiva enrolled in a course of Tibetan yoga taught by Pedro Espinosa de los Monteros, who became his spiritual teacher.Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.20 The course, called \\"The Science of MentalPhysics\\", had been designed, and introduced in America, by Edwin Dingle. It subjected students to a regimen of breathing exercises, affirmations, and sexual energy transmutation practices. After performing these practices for a year and a half, Shiva began experiencing various energy-related manifestations, or Kundalini syndrome, and some alterations of consciousness, which intensified over time. He described these experiences in a diary, which he published years later as part of an autobiographical book entitled Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo (With my Feet on the Path of Yoga and Mysticism).Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo In 1979, Shiva began to meditate. He first used a technique to purge the mind, which requires being attentive and passively observant of the flow of thoughts, feelings and emotions that appear in one's stream of consciousness. Doing this ultimately leads to their disappearing, leaving the mind in a clear and quiet state.Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.26 As these experiences intensified, Shiva's interests became almost exclusively spiritual. He abandoned his Anthropology studies, and dedicated himself almost exclusively to spiritual practices, and to reading and reflecting on spiritual matters.Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.27 In July 1980, he had his first mystical experience, which he described as a contact with his higher self, and which was accompanied by \\"a powerful sense of timelessness or eternity.\\"Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.28 Several mystical experiences followed, which revealed to him the \\"fountain that remains...beyond mutation and change...outside of time and space.\\" Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.29 For months he struggled to remain in a state that he recognized as the one Jiddu Krishnamurti called \\"awareness\\" and which George Gurdjieff described as \\"self-remembering\\". Because of these efforts, in early 1983, Shiva permanently became what he would later describe as an \\"awakened man,\\" that is, a person who is continually \\"simultaneously aware of himself and of his surroundings\\",Ram√≥n, J.A. (1988), El Hombre Despierto, p.11 in contrast with the common person or \\"sleeping man\\", which according to Shiva lives in a \\"state of psychic sleep\\".Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.39 On November 11, 1985 Shiva had his first experience of oneness with the absolute, in which \\"the whole universe disappeared, and only the infinite and eternal Absolute remained. There was no residue of individuality to realize it\\".Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.45  Teacher and writer: 1986‚Äìpresent  Since 1986, Shiva has written several books, taught several courses, and spoken in conferences and retreats, to publicize the difference between the \\"sleeping state\\" and the \\"awakened state\\", and the practices that lead from one to the other. He has also described the path and practices that can lead an awakened person to have superior mystical experiences.  Teaching  Misticosophy: synthesis of the world's mystical traditions. His most significant academic work consists of having studied and described the mystical traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Zen, Christianity, the Ancient Egyptian Religion, Judaism, Sufism and Toltecayotl, and synthesizing them to show that they all seek to guide humankind on how to advance on two different routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness and the creation of the body of light. This work was published in a series of books, each of which examines a specific mystical tradition in the light of one of the two routes Teachings on how to advance on the route of the awakening of spiritual consciousness These teachings address the steps and practices necessary to move from the state of a common person or \\"sleeping man\\", to a state of awareness or \\"awakened man.\\" According to Shiva, the common person lives in a state of \\"psychic dream\\", a fact which is easily verifiable by conducting the following experiment: \\"Pay attention to yourself and, simultaneously, to the place where you are. That is, remember yourself (in the sense of being aware of yourself, and not in the sense of thinking of yourself). Be aware of your body (do not think about it). Be mindful of it. Now you are aware of yourself. Stay in that state. Do not forget yourself, and then go on with your daily activities ... [by attempting this] you will discover how difficult it is to stay in that state, as it will not take more than a few minutes to become unaware of yourself and to return to the state of psychic dream\\".Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), El hombre despierto, p.13 Through various meditation exercises, the practitioner achieves ever longer periods of mindfulness, until the awakened state becomes permanent. That is the state \\"in which one is present, and simultaneously observes both the inner and outer world in a passive manner\\".Ram√≥n, J.A., Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo, p.17 The awakening of a person's spiritual consciousness is a process that can be verified by that person, and it does not require him to hold any religious beliefs. In a book entitled La experiencia del Despertar (The Experience of Awakening), Shiva describes the process of awakening, and the practices that lead to it, without using any of the religious terms with which it is commonly associated. Shiva sees this work as a bridge between spirituality and science, because there is no need to believe or have faith in any of the spiritual experiences described therein, which can be confirmed empirically by the practitioner. For those who have already reached a state of permanent spiritual wakefulness, Shiva has also laid out, in several books and lectures, the practices that lead to higher mystical experiences, which culminate with the experience of being one with the absolute. Teachings on how to advance on the route of the creation of the body of light These teachings address the practices needed to gradually increase the flow of energy that circulates through the body's network of energy channels,Ram√≥n, J.A. (1998), El yoga de la energ√≠a y el yoga de la atenci√≥n, p.27 so as to naturally activate the spiritual faculties of the practitioner, thus eventually producing in him the same awakened state described above. The energy practices that Shiva recommends are mostly psychophysical breathing exercises or Pranayama, and sexual transmutation.Ram√≥n, J.A.

Many of the cases involved students at the University of Montana. This included allegations of gang rape brought against University of Montana Grizzlies football players. The Department of Education would later open an investigation regarding the sexual assault issues within the football team. According to the DOJ, the County Attorney's Office rarely explained why they failed to prosecute offenders even when police investigators had found strong evidence of guilt. Van Valkenburg refused to cooperate with the DOJ investigation, going as far as to file a declaratory judgment to stop the investigation. In February 2014 the DOJ released a report stating that investigators had found \\"substantial evidence of gender bias\\" in the Missoula County Attorney's Office which amounted to a violation of federal law, including the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division stated: \\"We uncovered evidence of a disturbing pattern of deficiencies in the handling of these cases by the County Attorney‚Äôs Office, a pattern that not only denies victims meaningful access to justice, but places the safety of all women in Missoula at risk.

It is in the collection of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The painting shows two working undershot water mills, with the major one being half-timbered with a cob-facade construction, tie beams, and vertical plank gable. This is characteristic of the water mills in the Bentheim area in Germany, to where Ruisdael had travelled in the early 1650s. This painting is one of six known variations on this theme and the only one that is dated. Although other Western artists had depicted water mills before, Ruisdael was the first to make it the focal subject in a painting. Meindert Hobbema, Ruisdael's pupil, started working on the water mills subject in the 1660s. Today Hobbema is more strongly associated with water mills than his teacher. The painting is known by various names. The painting is called Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice in Seymour Slive's 2001 catalogue raisonn√© of Ruisdael, catalogue number 119. In his 2011 book on Ruisdael's mills and water mills Slive calls it Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice.

The DKP considered itself as a Christian socialist centre-left party with social democratic values. The party also placed great emphasis on the enforcement of the freedom of the press, while supporting the emergence of private farms but rejected the Independent Smallholders' Party's proposal of re-privatization.

Morphology Dogwood twig borer adults have slender, elongated bodies like many other beetles of the genus Oberea. They are between 10 and 15 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide. The head is dark to black and there are three prominent black spots arranged in a triangle on the beetles' thorax. The wing covers are a yellowish tan. There is a narrow black line on the inner edge and a broader, darker line on the outer wing on the lateral margin. There are also two distinct dots right behind the beetle's head. The larvae of dogwood twig borers, in their final phase, are yellowish, legless and about 19 millimeters long. Diet The dogwood twig borer is distributed in the United States of America wherever there are flowering dogwood trees. They are adaptable and although the bulk of a dogwood twig borer's diet is obtained from flowering dogwood trees, it can also feed on elm, azalea, and viburnum. Many species of fruit trees are attacked by the beetle. The beetle usually begins it's infestation by attacking individual twigs, so wilting leaves on twigs and drooping and girdling of twig tips most likely indicate an infestation by the dogwood twig borer. Pest control To control the dogwood twig borer, a common practice is to clip infested twigs several inches below the girdle, or the infected part of the twig, and then destroy it. This is usually done after wilting occurs, but before adult emergence during spring. This method is commonly recommended and has proved very effective at controlling the population of the dogwood twig borer. Another technique of eliminating the beetle is to spray with recommended insecticides before budding of the infected tree or shrub. The species is considered a minor pest of the dogwood. It usually does not cause any major problems, unlike the dogwood borer (Synanthedon scitula). Life cycle Dogwood twig borer adults emerge in early June, rarely in large numbers. They feed on dogwood twigs and cause girdling around the tips of branches. Females lay their eggs singly on healthy twigs. When the eggs hatch, larvae enter the twig and bore down into the centre. Parts of the twig are sometimes internally separated from the dogwood as a series of closely packed holes are drilled to remove the boring dust (frass). The beetle larvae winter in the stems. Some larvae continue to develop for up to two years. Larvae that pupate during the spring usually emerge from the stem between the middle of May and early June. Dogwood twig borer larvae are sometimes called Elm twig girdlers.

Darwin believed that the difference between males and females were partly due to \\"sexual selection\\". Darwin's theory of sexual selection, which can be found in his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, states that women, and some men, will choose to mate with someone that is most suitable to culture. This proposition of sexual selection readily tied into his theory of natural selection in the way that evolution will have different outcomes depending on the traits of the suitor the females chooses to reproduce with. This also supports his principle of \\"survival of the fittest\\" in the human species. Darwin concludes in his book, The Descent of Man, saying that men attain \\"a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can women‚Äîwhether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands.\\" More research has been centered around letters that Darwin wrote and exchanged with about 150 women in his lifetime which includes both women close to him and women from other places in the world. The letters show private thoughts and actions which are different to the gender ideology held by common middle-class Victorians. The letters show that in private Darwin relied on various women for some of his work including his daughter Henrietta who helped in editing The Descent of Man. Darwin also helped many of these women progress their scientific careers. He wrote to Eleanor Mary Dicey in 1877 about his concern that some women might not want to study psychology only because they are women. There is also evidence of Darwin's correspondence with women of that time who challenged the gender ideology such as Florence Dixie, a traveler, writer and hunter who endorsed equality in marriage.

The framework is based on the premise that systems are ‚Äúfunction-focused‚Äù, designed to complete a task as quickly as possible, similar to a factory process assuming workers will complete their tasks in a timely manner because they are required to do so. However, human-focused design acknowledges that people, unlike machines in a system have feelings, insecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore, optimizes for their feelings, motivations, and engagement. The framework lays out the structure for analyzing the driving forces behind human motivation. It is the process of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an interactive experience. The Octalysis framework is used in healthcare, fitness, education, training, company, and product design to increase user engagement, ROI and motivation.alt=Octalysis What makes Facebook so addictive?  Eight Core Drives  The Octalysis framework suggests that if there are no core drives present, then there is no motivation and no behavior will happen. This is based on the premise that almost all games appeal to certain core drives within us and motivate us towards a variety of decisions and activities. The framework divides these motivations into eight core drives.  Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling  This Core Drive is in play when a person believes he or she is doing something greater than oneself or was ‚Äúchosen‚Äù to take action. An example would be Wikipedia volunteers who maintain the page and contribute to the development of its content. Contributors do not receive any extrinsic reward, but they feel that their contribution will help to develop and protect human knowledge. The implementation of this drive can vastly differ, and is not limited to altruistic behavior. Some of the world's worst events and actions have happened with the belief of participating in something greater than oneself.  Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment  This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth towards a goal and accomplishing it. Win-State is often a scenario in which user has overcome a challenge. The perception of the challenge is important. For example, a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful for a person. This is the drive that most PBLs: Points, Badges, and Leaderboards focus on.  Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback  This drive is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but also need to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with Legos, playing Minecraft, and making art are intrinsically fun. When properly designed and integrated to empower users to be creative; they often become Evergreen Mechanics: a game designer no longer needs to continuously add content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. The brain simply entertains itself.  Core Drive 4: Ownership and Possession  This drive refers to users feeling like they own or control something. When a person feels ownership over something, they innately want to increase and improve what they own. For example, the human desire to accumulate wealth and the overvaluing of objects within one's possession are the result of this drive. People might think their house is worth far more than the market is willing to pay for it, not because of any intrinsic property of the house but because they personally own it.  Core Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness  This drive incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: mentorship, social acceptance, companionship, and even competition and envy. When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to attain the same. Think about how we naturally draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to, turning into a spot premium motivator.  Core Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience  Scarcity and impatience is the core drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare, exclusive, or immediately unattainable. Many games have Appointment dynamics or torture breaks within them (come back in 2 hours to get your reward). The fact that people can‚Äôt get something right now motivates them to return to check the availability of the product.  Core Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity  Unpredictability is the core drive of constantly being engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks into high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary core drive behind gambling addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results.  Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance  Loss and avoidance is the core drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behavior. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting. Opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this core drive, because people feel if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever. This is commonly known as fear of missing out and can often be seen in marketing promotions with limited time periods, or speculative investments where any delay may lead to missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Left and Right Brain Core Drives  Everything we do is based on one or more of the eight core drives. If none of them is present, there is zero motivation and no action takes place. Additionally, each of these drives have different natures within them. Some make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency. Others core drives create urgency, obsession, and even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some are more long- term intrinsically focused. As a result, the 8 core drives are charted on an octagon not simply for aesthetic purposes, but because the placement determines the nature of the motivation. The left side of the Octalysis chart is commonly associated with logic, analytical thought, and ownership. People are motivated by extrinsic elements such as rewards, money, goals, milestones, points, badges, recognition. However, once people obtain the goal or get used to it, they no longer take the desired behavior. The right side of the Octalysis chart relies on intrinsic motivation: creativity, self-expression and social dynamics. You don't need a goal or reward to use your creativity, hangout with friends, or to feel the suspense of unpredictability. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic core drives is an important task; research shows that extrinsic motivation impairs intrinsic motivation. Because once the companies stop offering the extrinsic motivator, user motivation will often plummet to a level much lower than when the extrinsic motivator was first introduced (the Over-justification Effect). Keep in mind that left brain and right brain references are not literal in terms of actual brain geography, but merely a symbolic differentiation between two distinct functions of the brain.  White Hat and Black Hat Core Drives  White Hat core drives make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. On the Octalysis octagon they are represented on the top. It involves motivations that engage the user on expressing creativity and achievement through mastering of skills, resulting in a higher sense of accomplishments, meaning, and empowerment. While they make us feel powerful, fulfilled and satisfied, they don't attain much urgency (\\"I am going to save the world, but I need a coffee first‚Äù). Black Hat core drives are located at the bottom of the Octalysis chart. Black Hat core drives make us feel obsessed, anxious and addicted. If you are always doing something because you don't know what will happen next, you are constantly in fear of losing something, or because you're struggling to attain things you can't have, the experience will often leave a bad taste in your mouth- even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions. The White Hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the top of the Octalysis diagram: * Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling * Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment * Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback The Black Hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the bottom of the Octalysis diagram: * Core Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience * Core Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity * Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance  Game Techniques  Each Core Drive has many game techniques associated with it. For example, Boosters - or items that empower Desired Actions - are a game technique of Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback. These techniques are numbered and can be found in both the book and the blog.  Application  Using the Octalysis framework, Magnum created a digital online game that resembles the Super Mario game.

It was distributed in support of the group's third album Headquarters, and later appeared on the reissued version of the LP. The song was recorded as the Monkees finally achieved the independence that enabled them to freely produce their own material, with the actual band members being featured on both vocals and instrumental arrangements. Upon release, \\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\\" charted at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100, while its A-side \\"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\\" propelled to number two. Background The Monkees had enjoyed enormous commercial success with their first two albums, The Monkees and More of the Monkees, both reaching number one on the Billboard 200. However, under the direction of their music supervisor Don Kirshner, the group was almost completely barred from studio work, aside from recording as vocalists and penning some original material. Longing to achieve creative freedom, the Monkees, led by Michael Nesmith, who felt especially insulted by Kirshner's condescension, entered months of bitter negotiations that eventually concluded with Kirshner's firing. With his departure, the band was finally given the ability to play the instruments themselves, making the Headquarters sessions the first of which to feature the actual members on the arrangements. Nesmith compared the Monkees' process to build upon their differing styles: \\"[It was like] a really good tennis player, and a really good football player, and a really good basketball player, and a really good golfer got together and played baseball. ... We could give it a try. Maybe make a little garage-band music\\". Although it was unknown to the record-buying public upon its release, \\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\\" was the first song recorded by the Monkees containing instruments performed by the band members. It was first recorded on 19 January 1967 with Nesmith on lead vocals; however, a second version was recorded on 23 February 1967, with Micky Dolenz replacing Nesmith to create a more commercialized sound. The song became very accessible with its breezy melodic shifts, catchy rhythm, and relatable lyrics. Since its original distribution, the composition has been featured on nearly all the Monkees' compilation albums, with it first appearing on 40 Timeless Hits in 1980.

He was one of the seven monks from the Abbey of Our Lady of Atlas in Tibhirine, Algeria, kidnapped and believed to have been later killed by Islamists. He was beatified with the eighteen others Martyrs of Algeria on December 9, 2018. Biography Early life He was born in Colmar, Haut-Rhin, in an aristocratic military family (whose moto is Recte Semper), and he spent part of his childhood in Algiers, French Algeria, where his father was commander of the 67th Artillery Regiment of Africa. De Cherg√© family returned afterwards to France, settling in Paris, where he studied at the Sainte-Marie de Manceau School, from 1947 to 1954, directed by the Society of Mary, and was a Boy Scout. He was a brilliant student at Sainte-Marie, winning at the year of his graduation the first Prize of Excellency. He felt the calling to the religious life since he was 8 years old. Religious life He entered Carmes Seminary, in Paris, in 1956. He returned to Algeria in 1959, during the Algerian War, as a young officer. He would always remember that he had his life saved by an Algerian Muslim named Mohamed, a father of ten children, during an ambush. De Cherg√© told him that he would pray for him but Mohamed answered him back: \\"I know that you will pray for me. But look, Christians don't know how to pray!\\" The next morning, he was found murdered. He never forgot this event, and later said: \\"In the blood of this friend, I knew that my calling to follow Christ meant to live, sooner or later, in the country where it was given to me the greatest gift of love\\". He returned to France, where he was ordained a priest at the Church of Saint-Sulpice, in Paris, in 1964. He was chaplain at the Basilica of Montmartre, from 1964 to 1969. He decided to enter the Atlas Abbey, in Tibhirine, Algeria, where he arrived, after a novitiate at Aiguebelle Abbey, in 1971. He studied Arab language and culture with the White Fathers at the Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies in Rome from 1972 to 1974. In 1984, Atlas Abbey became a simple priory. He was elected the same year the prior. Study of Islam and the Quran De Cherg√© during his time at the Atlas Abbey always encouraged the Islamic-Christian dialogue. He had a deep knowledge and a great respect for Islam and the Arab and Islamic culture. He spoke several languages, including Arabic, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. De Ch√©rg√© had a mystical night, during Ramadan, on 21 September 1975, when it took place at the monastery chapel a common prayer between a Christian and a Muslim. He never ceased to deepen that faith in the unity of the two religions during his lifetime. He studied and meditated the suras of the Quran concerning \\"Jesus, son of Mary\\", the \\"people of the Book\\", and the Christians, comparing the words and concepts of both religions, like \\"Mercy\\" and \\"the Merciful\\". The Group Rib√¢t-al-Salam He founded, with Claude Rault, a White Father who became bishop of Sahara, the group Rib√¢t-al-Salam (The Place of Peace), who discussed the Muslim tradition and spirituality, in the Spring of 1979. In 1980, the group was joined by Sufi Muslims from the fraternity Alawya, founded by sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi. The group had regular meetings at the monastery, representing a place for dialogue and prayer between Christians and Muslims, in mutual respect. Last years, kidnapping and death Father Christian de Cherg√© tomb in the Abbey of Our Lady of Atlas cemetery In the early 1990s, Islamic fundamentalism threatened Algeria. In 1993, a group of armed men irrupted into the monastery shortly after the murder of twelve Croatians, three kilometers nearby. Dom De Ch√©rg√© had a bad feeling and decided to write his now famous testament, for two times, on 1 December 1993 and 1 January 1994. It would be published in the newspaper La Croix, shortly after his death, on 29 May 1996, and it became known as the Spiritual Testament of Christian de Ch√©rg√©.Christian de Ch√©rg√©, A Story of Forgiveness, Article by Johann Christoph Arnold, PloughTestament of Christian de Cherg√©, O.S.C.O. Official Website In the night of 26 to 27 March 1996, a group of 20 armed men from the GIA entered the monastery at 1:45 AM. They took seven monks captive, including one, Brother Bruno, who was a visitor from F√®s, Morocco. Two monks escaped the kidnappers. A message signed by the GIA announced that the seven monks had been beheaded on 21 May 1996. It is still uncertain who killed them, because some sources claim that they died during an airstrike from the Algerian Air Force. Father de Cherg√© and the other monks were buried in the Abbey of Our Lady of Atlas cemetery. Beatification process The Diocese of Algiers started the process for the beatification of Christian de Cherg√© and the monks of Tibhirine in 1996. On 7 October 2013, the Order of the Cistercians of the Strict Observance announced that the Archbishop of Algiers, with the agreement of the Abbot General and his council, had nominated Father Thomas Georgeon, his Secretary General, as the postulator of the process of beatification of Archbishop Pierre Lucien Claverie and 18 companions, including the 7 Tibhirine monks. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the appointment on 11 October 2013.Sainthood Cause of the Martyrs of Algeria, opened, Communio, 3 December 2013 The beatification took place in Oran, Algeria, on 8 December 2018.

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.. In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis. Linear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine. Linear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories: * If the goal is prediction, forecasting, or error reduction, linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed data set of values of the response and explanatory variables. After developing such a model, if additional values of the explanatory variables are collected without an accompanying response value, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the response. * If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables, linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables, and in particular to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the response at all, or to identify which subsets of explanatory variables may contain redundant information about the response. Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \\"lack of fit\\" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \\"least squares\\" and \\"linear model\\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.  Introduction  In linear regression, the observations (red) are assumed to be the result of random deviations (green) from an underlying relationship (blue) between a dependent variable (y) and an independent variable (x). Given a data set \\\\\\\\{y_i,\\\\, x_{i1}, \\\\ldots, x_{ip}\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n of n statistical units, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable y and the p-vector of regressors x is linear. This relationship is modeled through a disturbance term or error variable Œµ ‚Äî an unobserved random variable that adds \\"noise\\" to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. Thus the model takes the form : y_i = \\\\beta_{0} + \\\\beta_{1} x_{i1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_{p} x_{ip} + \\\\varepsilon_i = \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\mathsf{T}_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon_i, \\\\qquad i = 1, \\\\ldots, n, where T denotes the transpose, so that xiTŒ≤ is the inner product between vectors xi and Œ≤. Often these n equations are stacked together and written in matrix notation as : \\\\mathbf{y} = X\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon, \\\\, where : \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_n \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad : X = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\mathsf{T}_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\mathsf{T}_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\mathsf{T}_n \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_{11} & \\\\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & x_{21} & \\\\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & x_{n1} & \\\\cdots & x_{np} \\\\end{pmatrix}, : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\beta_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_p \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_n \\\\end{pmatrix}. Some remarks on notation and terminology: * \\\\mathbf{y} is a vector of observed values y_i\\\\ (i=1,\\\\ldots,n) of the variable called the regressand, endogenous variable, response variable, measured variable, criterion variable, or dependent variable. This variable is also sometimes known as the predicted variable, but this should not be confused with predicted values, which are denoted \\\\hat{y}. The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled as the dependent variable and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables. Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality. * X may be seen as a matrix of row- vectors \\\\mathbf{x}_i or of n-dimensional column-vectors X_j, which are known as regressors, exogenous variables, explanatory variables, covariates, input variables, predictor variables, or independent variables (not to be confused with the concept of independent random variables). The matrix X is sometimes called the design matrix. ** Usually a constant is included as one of the regressors. In particular, \\\\mathbf{x}_{i0}=1 for i=1,\\\\ldots,n. The corresponding element of Œ≤ is called the intercept. Many statistical inference procedures for linear models require an intercept to be present, so it is often included even if theoretical considerations suggest that its value should be zero. ** Sometimes one of the regressors can be a non-linear function of another regressor or of the data, as in polynomial regression and segmented regression. The model remains linear as long as it is linear in the parameter vector Œ≤. ** The values xij may be viewed as either observed values of random variables Xj or as fixed values chosen prior to observing the dependent variable. Both interpretations may be appropriate in different cases, and they generally lead to the same estimation procedures; however different approaches to asymptotic analysis are used in these two situations. * \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta is a (p+1)-dimensional parameter vector, where \\\\beta_0 is the intercept term (if one is included in the model‚Äîotherwise \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta is p-dimensional). Its elements are known as effects or regression coefficients (although the latter term is sometimes reserved for the estimated effects). Statistical estimation and inference in linear regression focuses on Œ≤. The elements of this parameter vector are interpreted as the partial derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the various independent variables. * \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon is a vector of values \\\\varepsilon_i. This part of the model is called the error term, disturbance term, or sometimes noise (in contrast with the \\"signal\\" provided by the rest of the model). This variable captures all other factors which influence the dependent variable y other than the regressors x. The relationship between the error term and the regressors, for example their correlation, is a crucial consideration in formulating a linear regression model, as it will determine the appropriate estimation method. Fitting a linear model to a given data set usually requires estimating the regression coefficients \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta such that the error term \\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon=\\\\mathbf{y}- X\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta is minimized. For example, it is common to use the sum of squared errors ||\\\\boldsymbol\\\\varepsilon|as the quality of the fit. Example. Consider a situation where a small ball is being tossed up in the air and then we measure its heights of ascent hi at various moments in time ti. Physics tells us that, ignoring the drag, the relationship can be modeled as : h_i = \\\\beta_1 t_i + \\\\beta_2 t_i^2 + \\\\varepsilon_i, where Œ≤1 determines the initial velocity of the ball, Œ≤2 is proportional to the standard gravity, and Œµi is due to measurement errors. Linear regression can be used to estimate the values of Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 from the measured data. This model is non-linear in the time variable, but it is linear in the parameters Œ≤1 and Œ≤2; if we take regressors xi = (xi1, xi2) = (ti, ti2), the model takes on the standard form : h_i = \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\mathsf{T}_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon_i. Assumptions Standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques make a number of assumptions about the predictor variables, the response variables and their relationship. Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Generally these extensions make the estimation procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model. Example of a cubic polynomial regression, which is a type of linear regression. The following are the major assumptions made by standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques (e.g. ordinary least squares): *Weak exogeneity. This essentially means that the predictor variables x can be treated as fixed values, rather than random variables. This means, for example, that the predictor variables are assumed to be error-free‚Äîthat is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is not realistic in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult errors-in- variables models. *Linearity. This means that the mean of the response variable is a linear combination of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables. Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem. Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters. The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently. This technique is used, for example, in polynomial regression, which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary polynomial function (up to a given rank) of a predictor variable. With this much flexibility, models such as polynomial regression often have \\"too much power\\", in that they tend to overfit the data. As a result, some kind of regularization must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process. Common examples are ridge regression and lasso regression. Bayesian linear regression can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of overfitting. (In fact, ridge regression and lasso regression can both be viewed as special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of prior distributions placed on the regression coefficients.) *Constant variance (a.k.a. homoscedasticity). This means that different values of the response variable have the same variance in their errors, regardless of the values of the predictor variables. In practice this assumption is invalid (i.e. the errors are heteroscedastic) if the response variable can vary over a wide scale. In order to check for heterogeneous error variance, or when a pattern of residuals violates model assumptions of homoscedasticity (error is equally variable around the 'best-fitting line' for all points of x), it is prudent to look for a \\"fanning effect\\" between residual error and predicted values. This is to say there will be a systematic change in the absolute or squared residuals when plotted against the predictive variables. Errors will not be evenly distributed across the regression line. Heteroscedasticity will result in the averaging over of distinguishable variances around the points to get a single variance that is inaccurately representing all the variances of the line. In effect, residuals appear clustered and spread apart on their predicted plots for larger and smaller values for points along the linear regression line, and the mean squared error for the model will be wrong. Typically, for example, a response variable whose mean is large will have a greater variance than one whose mean is small. For example, a given person whose income is predicted to be $100,000 may easily have an actual income of $80,000 or $120,000 (a standard deviation of around $20,000), while another person with a predicted income of $10,000 is unlikely to have the same $20,000 standard deviation, which would imply their actual income would vary anywhere between -$10,000 and $30,000. (In fact, as this shows, in many cases‚Äîoften the same cases where the assumption of normally distributed errors fails‚Äîthe variance or standard deviation should be predicted to be proportional to the mean, rather than constant.) Simple linear regression estimation methods give less precise parameter estimates and misleading inferential quantities such as standard errors when substantial heteroscedasticity is present. However, various estimation techniques (e.g. weighted least squares and heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors) can handle heteroscedasticity in a quite general way. Bayesian linear regression techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean. It is also possible in some cases to fix the problem by applying a transformation to the response variable (e.g. fit the logarithm of the response variable using a linear regression model, which implies that the response variable has a log-normal distribution rather than a normal distribution). *Independence of errors. This assumes that the errors of the response variables are uncorrelated with each other. (Actual statistical independence is a stronger condition than mere lack of correlation and is often not needed, although it can be exploited if it is known to hold.) Some methods (e.g. generalized least squares) are capable of handling correlated errors, although they typically require significantly more data unless some sort of regularization is used to bias the model towards assuming uncorrelated errors. Bayesian linear regression is a general way of handling this issue. *Lack of perfect multicollinearity in the predictors. For standard least squares estimation methods, the design matrix X must have full column rank p; otherwise, we have a condition known as perfect multicollinearity in the predictor variables. This can be triggered by having two or more perfectly correlated predictor variables (e.g. if the same predictor variable is mistakenly given twice, either without transforming one of the copies or by transforming one of the copies linearly). It can also happen if there is too little data available compared to the number of parameters to be estimated (e.g. fewer data points than regression coefficients). In the case of perfect multicollinearity, the parameter vector Œ≤ will be non-identifiable‚Äîit has no unique solution. At most we will be able to identify some of the parameters, i.e. narrow down its value to some linear subspace of Rp. See partial least squares regression. Methods for fitting linear models with multicollinearity have been developed; some require additional assumptions such as \\"effect sparsity\\"‚Äîthat a large fraction of the effects are exactly zero. Note that the more computationally expensive iterated algorithms for parameter estimation, such as those used in generalized linear models, do not suffer from this problem. Beyond these assumptions, several other statistical properties of the data strongly influence the performance of different estimation methods: * The statistical relationship between the error terms and the regressors plays an important role in determining whether an estimation procedure has desirable sampling properties such as being unbiased and consistent. * The arrangement, or probability distribution of the predictor variables x has a major influence on the precision of estimates of Œ≤. Sampling and design of experiments are highly developed subfields of statistics that provide guidance for collecting data in such a way to achieve a precise estimate of Œ≤. Interpretation The data sets in the Anscombe's quartet are designed to have approximately the same linear regression line (as well as nearly identical means, standard deviations, and correlations) but are graphically very different. This illustrates the pitfalls of relying solely on a fitted model to understand the relationship between variables. A fitted linear regression model can be used to identify the relationship between a single predictor variable xj and the response variable y when all the other predictor variables in the model are \\"held fixed\\". Specifically, the interpretation of Œ≤j is the expected change in y for a one-unit change in xj when the other covariates are held fixed‚Äîthat is, the expected value of the partial derivative of y with respect to xj. This is sometimes called the unique effect of xj on y. In contrast, the marginal effect of xj on y can be assessed using a correlation coefficient or simple linear regression model relating only xj to y; this effect is the total derivative of y with respect to xj. Care must be taken when interpreting regression results, as some of the regressors may not allow for marginal changes (such as dummy variables, or the intercept term), while others cannot be held fixed (recall the example from the introduction: it would be impossible to \\"hold ti fixed\\" and at the same time change the value of ti2). It is possible that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in xj, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of xj to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of xj can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained a great deal of the variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by xj. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to xj, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with xj. The meaning of the expression \\"held fixed\\" may depend on how the values of the predictor variables arise. If the experimenter directly sets the values of the predictor variables according to a study design, the comparisons of interest may literally correspond to comparisons among units whose predictor variables have been \\"held fixed\\" by the experimenter. Alternatively, the expression \\"held fixed\\" can refer to a selection that takes place in the context of data analysis. In this case, we \\"hold a variable fixed\\" by restricting our attention to the subsets of the data that happen to have a common value for the given predictor variable. This is the only interpretation of \\"held fixed\\" that can be used in an observational study. The notion of a \\"unique effect\\" is appealing when studying a complex system where multiple interrelated components influence the response variable. In some cases, it can literally be interpreted as the causal effect of an intervention that is linked to the value of a predictor variable. However, it has been argued that in many cases multiple regression analysis fails to clarify the relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable when the predictors are correlated with each other and are not assigned following a study design. Commonality analysis may be helpful in disentangling the shared and unique impacts of correlated independent variables. Extensions Numerous extensions of linear regression have been developed, which allow some or all of the assumptions underlying the basic model to be relaxed. Simple and multiple linear regression Example of simple linear regression, which has one independent variable The very simplest case of a single scalar predictor variable x and a single scalar response variable y is known as simple linear regression. The extension to multiple and/or vector-valued predictor variables (denoted with a capital X) is known as multiple linear regression, also known as multivariable linear regression. Multiple linear regression is a generalization of simple linear regression to the case of more than one independent variable, and a special case of general linear models, restricted to one dependent variable. The basic model for multiple linear regression is : Y_i = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 X_{i1} + \\\\beta_2 X_{i2} + \\\\ldots + \\\\beta_p X_{ip} + \\\\epsilon_i for each observation i = 1, ... , n. In the formula above we consider n observations of one dependent variable and p independent variables. Thus, Yi is the ith observation of the dependent variable, Xij is ith observation of the jth independent variable, j = 1, 2, ..., p. The values Œ≤j represent parameters to be estimated, and Œµi is the ith independent identically distributed normal error. In the more general multivariate linear regression, there is one equation of the above form for each of m > 1 dependent variables that share the same set of explanatory variables and hence are estimated simultaneously with each other: : Y_{ij} = \\\\beta_{0j} + \\\\beta_{1j} X_{i1} + \\\\beta_{2j}X_{i2} + \\\\ldots + \\\\beta_{pj} X_{ip} + \\\\epsilon_{ij} for all observations indexed as i = 1, ... , n and for all dependent variables indexed as j = 1, ... , m. Nearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased in terms of the multiple regression model. Note, however, that in these cases the response variable y is still a scalar. Another term, multivariate linear regression, refers to cases where y is a vector, i.e., the same as general linear regression. General linear models The general linear model considers the situation when the response variable is not a scalar (for each observation) but a vector, yi. Conditional linearity of E(\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\mathsf{T}B is still assumed, with a matrix B replacing the vector Œ≤ of the classical linear regression model. Multivariate analogues of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) have been developed. \\"General linear models\\" are also called \\"multivariate linear models\\". These are not the same as multivariable linear models (also called \\"multiple linear models\\"). Heteroscedastic models Various models have been created that allow for heteroscedasticity, i.e. the errors for different response variables may have different variances. For example, weighted least squares is a method for estimating linear regression models when the response variables may have different error variances, possibly with correlated errors. (See also Weighted linear least squares, and Generalized least squares.) Heteroscedasticity- consistent standard errors is an improved method for use with uncorrelated but potentially heteroscedastic errors. Generalized linear models Generalized linear models (GLMs) are a framework for modeling response variables that are bounded or discrete. This is used, for example: *when modeling positive quantities (e.g. prices or populations) that vary over a large scale‚Äîwhich are better described using a skewed distribution such as the log-normal distribution or Poisson distribution (although GLMs are not used for log-normal data, instead the response variable is simply transformed using the logarithm function); *when modeling categorical data, such as the choice of a given candidate in an election (which is better described using a Bernoulli distribution/binomial distribution for binary choices, or a categorical distribution/multinomial distribution for multi-way choices), where there are a fixed number of choices that cannot be meaningfully ordered; *when modeling ordinal data, e.g. ratings on a scale from 0 to 5, where the different outcomes can be ordered but where the quantity itself may not have any absolute meaning (e.g. a rating of 4 may not be \\"twice as good\\" in any objective sense as a rating of 2, but simply indicates that it is better than 2 or 3 but not as good as 5). Generalized linear models allow for an arbitrary link function, g, that relates the mean of the response variable(s) to the predictors: E(Y) = g^{-1}(XB). The link function is often related to the distribution of the response, and in particular it typically has the effect of transforming between the (-\\\\infty,\\\\infty) range of the linear predictor and the range of the response variable. Some common examples of GLMs are: *Poisson regression for count data. *Logistic regression and probit regression for binary data. *Multinomial logistic regression and multinomial probit regression for categorical data. *Ordered logit and ordered probit regression for ordinal data. Single index models allow some degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between x and y, while preserving the central role of the linear predictor Œ≤‚Ä≤x as in the classical linear regression model. Under certain conditions, simply applying OLS to data from a single-index model will consistently estimate Œ≤ up to a proportionality constant. Hierarchical linear models Hierarchical linear models (or multilevel regression) organizes the data into a hierarchy of regressions, for example where A is regressed on B, and B is regressed on C. It is often used where the variables of interest have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels. Errors-in- variables Errors-in-variables models (or \\"measurement error models\\") extend the traditional linear regression model to allow the predictor variables X to be observed with error. This error causes standard estimators of Œ≤ to become biased. Generally, the form of bias is an attenuation, meaning that the effects are biased toward zero. Others * In Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory, or a linear belief function in particular, a linear regression model may be represented as a partially swept matrix, which can be combined with similar matrices representing observations and other assumed normal distributions and state equations. The combination of swept or unswept matrices provides an alternative method for estimating linear regression models. Estimation methods A large number of procedures have been developed for parameter estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, robustness with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency. Some of the more common estimation techniques for linear regression are summarized below. Least-squares estimation and related techniques Francis Galton's 1875 illustration of the correlation between the heights of adults and their parents. The observation that adult children's heights tended to deviate less from the mean height than their parents suggested the concept of \\"regression toward the mean\\", giving regression its name. The \\"locus of horizontal tangential points\\" passing through the leftmost and rightmost points on the ellipse (which is a level curve of the bivariate normal distribution estimated from the data) is the OLS estimate of the regression of parents' heights on children's heights, while the \\"locus of vertical tangential points\\" is the OLS estimate of the regression of children's heights on parent's heights. The major axis of the ellipse is the TLS estimate. Assuming that the independent variable is \\\\vec{x_i} = [x_1^i, x_2^i, \\\\dots, x_m^i] and the model's parameters are \\\\vec{\\\\beta} = [\\\\beta_0, \\\\beta_1, \\\\cdots, \\\\beta_m], then the model's prediction would be y_i \\\\approx \\\\beta_0 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\beta_j\\\\times x_j^i. If \\\\vec{x_i} is extended to \\\\vec{x_i} = [1, x_1^i, x_2^i, \\\\dots, x_m^i] then y_i would become a dot product of the parameter and the independent variable, i.e. y_i \\\\approx \\\\sum_{j=0}^ m \\\\beta_j \\\\times x_j^i = \\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\,\\\\,.\\\\, \\\\vec{x_i}. In the least-squares setting, the optimum parameter is defined as such that minimizes the sum of mean squared loss: \\\\vec{\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} = \\\\underset{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\mbox{arg min}\\\\,L(D, \\\\vec{\\\\beta}) = \\\\underset{\\\\vec{\\\\beta}}\\\\mbox{arg min} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\, . \\\\, \\\\vec{x_{i}} - y_i)^2 Now putting the independent and dependent variables in matrices X and Y respectively, the loss function can be rewritten as: \\\\begin{align} L(D, \\\\vec{\\\\beta})&= ||X\\\\vec{\\\\beta} - Y||^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (X\\\\vec{\\\\beta} - Y)^T (X\\\\vec{\\\\beta} - Y) \\\\\\\\\\\\&= Y^{T}Y- Y^{T}X\\\\vec{\\\\beta}- \\\\vec{\\\\beta}^{T}X^TY+\\\\vec{\\\\beta}^{T}X^TX\\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\end{align} As the loss is convex the optimum solution lies at gradient zero. The gradient of the loss function is (using Denominator layout convention): \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L(D, \\\\vec{\\\\beta})}{\\\\partial \\\\vec{\\\\beta}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\left(Y^{T}Y- Y^{T}X\\\\vec{\\\\beta}- \\\\vec{\\\\beta}^{T}X^TY+\\\\vec{\\\\beta}^{T}X^TX\\\\vec{\\\\beta}\\\\right)}{\\\\partial \\\\vec{\\\\beta}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -2Y^TX + 2\\\\vec{\\\\beta}^TX^TX \\\\end{align} Setting the gradient to zero produces the optimum parameter: \\\\begin{align} -2Y^TX + 2\\\\vec{\\\\beta}^TX^TX = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow Y^TX = \\\\vec{\\\\beta}^TX^TX \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow X^TY = X^TX\\\\vec{\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow \\\\vec{\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY \\\\end{align} Note: To prove that the \\\\hat{\\\\beta} obtained is indeed the local minimum, one needs to differentiate once more to obtain the Hessian matrix and show that it is positive definite. This is provided by the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem. Linear least squares methods include mainly: *Ordinary least squares *Weighted least squares *Generalized least squares Maximum- likelihood estimation and related techniques * Maximum likelihood estimation can be performed when the distribution of the error terms is known to belong to a certain parametric family ∆íŒ∏ of probability distributions. When fŒ∏ is a normal distribution with zero mean and variance Œ∏, the resulting estimate is identical to the OLS estimate. GLS estimates are maximum likelihood estimates when Œµ follows a multivariate normal distribution with a known covariance matrix. * Ridge regression and other forms of penalized estimation, such as Lasso regression, deliberately introduce bias into the estimation of Œ≤ in order to reduce the variability of the estimate. The resulting estimates generally have lower mean squared error than the OLS estimates, particularly when multicollinearity is present or when overfitting is a problem. They are generally used when the goal is to predict the value of the response variable y for values of the predictors x that have not yet been observed. These methods are not as commonly used when the goal is inference, since it is difficult to account for the bias. * Least absolute deviation (LAD) regression is a robust estimation technique in that it is less sensitive to the presence of outliers than OLS (but is less efficient than OLS when no outliers are present). It is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation under a Laplace distribution model for Œµ. * Adaptive estimation. If we assume that error terms are independent of the regressors, \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\perp \\\\mathbf{x}_i, then the optimal estimator is the 2-step MLE, where the first step is used to non-parametrically estimate the distribution of the error term. Other estimation techniques Comparison of the Theil‚ÄìSen estimator (black) and simple linear regression (blue) for a set of points with outliers. * Bayesian linear regression applies the framework of Bayesian statistics to linear regression. (See also Bayesian multivariate linear regression.) In particular, the regression coefficients Œ≤ are assumed to be random variables with a specified prior distribution. The prior distribution can bias the solutions for the regression coefficients, in a way similar to (but more general than) ridge regression or lasso regression. In addition, the Bayesian estimation process produces not a single point estimate for the \\"best\\" values of the regression coefficients but an entire posterior distribution, completely describing the uncertainty surrounding the quantity. This can be used to estimate the \\"best\\" coefficients using the mean, mode, median, any quantile (see quantile regression), or any other function of the posterior distribution. * Quantile regression focuses on the conditional quantiles of y given X rather than the conditional mean of y given X. Linear quantile regression models a particular conditional quantile, for example the conditional median, as a linear function Œ≤Tx of the predictors. * Mixed models are widely used to analyze linear regression relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as parametric models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as normal random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares. Fixed effects estimation is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data. * Principal component regression (PCR) is used when the number of predictor variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor variables. This two-stage procedure first reduces the predictor variables using principal component analysis then uses the reduced variables in an OLS regression fit. While it often works well in practice, there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the predictor variables should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the predictor variables. The partial least squares regression is the extension of the PCR method which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency. * Least-angle regression is an estimation procedure for linear regression models that was developed to handle high- dimensional covariate vectors, potentially with more covariates than observations. *The Theil‚ÄìSen estimator is a simple robust estimation technique that chooses the slope of the fit line to be the median of the slopes of the lines through pairs of sample points. It has similar statistical efficiency properties to simple linear regression but is much less sensitive to outliers.; . * Other robust estimation techniques, including the Œ±-trimmed mean approach, and L-, M-, S-, and R-estimators have been introduced. Applications Linear regression is widely used in biological, behavioral and social sciences to describe possible relationships between variables. It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines. Trend line A trend line represents a trend, the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line. Trend lines are sometimes used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This has the advantage of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data. Epidemiology Early evidence relating tobacco smoking to mortality and morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In order to reduce spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models in addition to the variable of primary interest. For example, in a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of primary interest and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years, researchers might include education and income as additional independent variables, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to those other socio-economic factors. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data. Finance The capital asset pricing model uses linear regression as well as the concept of beta for analyzing and quantifying the systematic risk of an investment. This comes directly from the beta coefficient of the linear regression model that relates the return on the investment to the return on all risky assets. Economics Linear regression is the predominant empirical tool in economics. For example, it is used to predict consumption spending, fixed investment spending, inventory investment, purchases of a country's exports, spending on imports, the demand to hold liquid assets, labor demand, and labor supply. Environmental science Linear regression finds application in a wide range of environmental science applications. In Canada, the Environmental Effects Monitoring Program uses statistical analyses on fish and benthic surveys to measure the effects of pulp mill or metal mine effluent on the aquatic ecosystem.EEMP webpage Machine learning Linear regression plays an important role in the field of artificial intelligence such as machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties. History Least squares linear regression, as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points was performed by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1809) for the prediction of planetary movement. Quetelet was responsible for making the procedure well-known and for using it extensively in the social sciences.

It was built from 1890 to 1891, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History This rail depot was a part of the expansion of rail facilities in the late 19th century when the railroad's expanded to maximize transportation and commerce opportunities. Prior to the Union Depot's construction, Keokuk was served by deplorable rail facilities that were described as being little more than shanties. Five railroads banded together to form the Keokuk Union Depot Company: the Keokuk & Western Railroad, the St. Louis, Keokuk & Northwestern Railroad, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad (Rock Island line), the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railway, and the Wabash Railroad. They hired Chicago architect John Wellborn Root from Burnham & Root to design the Romanesque Revival depot. It was one of the last buildings he designed before his death. Herbert William Chamberlain, of the same firm, served as supervising architect. Ten years after it opened the Keokuk & Western Railroad and the St. Louis, Keokuk & Northwestern Railroad were absorbed into the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;), which then operated from here. Keokuk was a stop for the Mark Twain Zephyr (CB&Q;) between Burlington, Iowa and St. Louis, and the Zephyr Rocket, a joint venture of the CB&Q; and the Rock Island line between Minneapolis and St. Louis. Passenger rail service ended at the depot in 1967, after which it was used by the railroads as a headquarters for their agents and operators. The Keokuk Junction Railway (KJRY) acquired the local yard trackage and switching rights from the bankrupt Rock Island lines, and in 1981 they bought all of the shares of the Keokuk Union Depot Company. The depot was used by the KJRY as the base for their tourist train operations, and its trolley rides across the Mississippi into Illinois. Pioneer Railcorp acquired the Keokuk Junction Railway's assets in 1996. They used the old depot for storage until 2011 when they conveyed the depot and the adjacent land to the City of Keokuk for 99 years. The city formed the Depot Commission to oversee the management and preservation of the facility. A non-profit organization, the Keokuk Union Depot Foundation, was established the following year to raise the necessary funds to preserve and run the depot. Architecture The depot is a Late Victorian style, Romanesque Revival, brick structure with sandstone trim. It features an asymmetrical elevation that includes a peaked roof in the middle and round-arched window and door openings. It is built on a limestone foundation. A steel, curvilinear-roofed canopy that provided shelter for passengers and freight runs the length of the depot on the east side. The interior features solid oak trusses and a built-in ticket booth and restrooms.

The film stars Finn Wittrock and Emilie de Ravin, with supporting performances from Jack Coleman, Nancy Travis, Alphonso McAuley, Hunter Cope, and Joe Massingill. The film had its world premiere on November 12, 2015 at the Napa Valley Film Festival. The film was released through video on demand on January 12, 2016, by MarVista Entertainment. Plot Spencer Koll (Finn Wittrock), a Marine who has just returned home from a horrific experience while serving, struggles to bring himself back into a normal life with his friends and girlfriend. Spencer then meets Alice, who is everything to him, but is meanwhile haunted by a ghost from his time during the war. Alice then introduces him to the story of the submarine kid at a party. Spencer hears his friends outside and tries to break up a fight between his friends and other party attendees. Spencer then suffers a flashback and attacks the instigator of the fight, beating him, and severely wounding him. The flashback eventually brings Spencer to driving his car with Alice and her screaming for him to stop. Spencer is eventually calmed down by Alice who he then takes to Thunder Lake. Spencer shows Alice a driving maneuver on a road near the lake and eventually have sex, resulting in Spencer concluding he never wants to leave Alice. Spencer then attempts the maneuver again with Alice, but this time crashes through the fence and into Thunder Lake. Spencer then wakes up in the hospital thinking he has killed Alice as no one knows who or where she is. Realizing Alice is only with him while he is suffocating underwater, or hallucinating, Spencer spends the rest of the movie trying to escape his flashbacks and to join Alice by holding his breath underwater for longer and longer periods of time. With each near drowning, his family and friends become more and more worried about his decaying mental state. Spencer eventually discovers that Alice is actually the ghost of the Submarine Kid's girlfriend. Alice eventually discourages Spencer's self- destructive behavior telling him that no world is perfect and that he can't escape his haunting memories in reality by drowning himself to be with her. After receiving his discharge from the Marine Corps, Spencer has another flashback, this time of the entire incident that has caused his PTSD. Spencer is shown in a foreign country with his squad when they happen upon armed militants. With failing radios, Spencer thinks he is ordered to shoot the militants, and is actually instructed not to. Spencer shoots and kills a woman who was used as a human shield by a militant. This woman is the hallucination that has been appearing in Spencer's waking life. The squad retreats, and in the process, Spencer is shot and dragged out by his squad. The next morning, Spencer's friends find him in the middle of Thunder Lake and realize he is trying to drown himself again. Spencer has another visit with Alice, who is in a wedding dress, waiting for the Submarine Kid underneath a boardwalk. Instead of the Submarine Kid, Spencer shows up and says he wants to stay with Alice forever. Alice says she cannot, and cannot make him become the Submarine Kid like she thought she could. Alice continues, telling Spencer that the wedding isn't meant for him and that they can never move on if they are together. Spencer tries to prove his devotion to being the Submarine Kid by asking Alice to time him as he drowns himself again. Meanwhile, in the real world, Spencer's friends and family are desperately trying to find him in Thunder Lake while Spencer, who is below the surface, finds the skeletal remains of the original Submarine Kid. Back in Spencer's dream world, he resurfaces in his combat uniform asking Alice how long he was under for, only to find the ghost woman he shot and killed while deployed. Spencer realizes he cannot run from his emotional trauma, and resurfaces in the real world with the Submarine Kid's goggles. Spencer leaves the goggles near the shore of Thunder Lake, allowing Alice's ghost to move now as she can now be with the Submarine Kid.

It begins in the Waldo Hills near Macleay, east of Salem, and flows generally north to meet the larger river west of Mt. Angel. The confluence is about from the Pudding River's mouth on the Molalla River. The map includes mile markers along the Pudding River. Course The river flows northwest from near Macleay under State Street, Conifer Street Northeast, and Sunnyview Road before turning north, then northwest again and flowing under Oregon Route 213. Shortly thereafter, it receives West Fork from the left. Downstream of this, as it flows by Hazel Green, Howell Prairie is on its right, and Lake Labish is on its left. Turning northeast, the river receives Woods Creek from the right as well as Lake Labish Ditch and Carnes Creek from the left before passing under Howell Creek Road near Parkerville Dam and entering the Pudding River. Floods Lake Labish Ditch was created in the late 19th century to drain historic Lake Labish in order to use the lakebed for farming. Before 1950, floods on the Pudding River sometimes flowed backwards up the Little Pudding River and into the valley around the ditch. In the 1950s, the Natural Resources Conservation Service built Parkerville Dam and pump station on the lower Little Pudding to prevent backflow flooding. Even so, water accumulating behind the dam flooded 15 homes in Keizer in 1996.

This manipulation wins over Doreen's trust such that she foils an attack on Joan in the exercise yard. Jess appeared to be inspired by the character of Lynn Warner from the first season of Prisoner. Sharing the same last name, both women are known for crying a lot and declaring their innocence. Both were accused of harming a child, but Lynn was not actually guilty of alleged attempted child murder. Reception When talking about who was the hitman against Bea, the Metro described Jess as \\"seemingly timid\\" and also stated \\"aside from blatantly fancying prison guard Fletch, is hiding a secret\\" Geelong Advertiser described Jess as \\"a frightened, yet seductive prisoner\\" in an article talking about actress Chara. In a review for Wentworth's third season, the reviewer described Jess as \\"creepy as ever\\". Chara was included on the long-list for the Logie Award for Best New Talent for her role as Warner. An AfterEllen review discussed Jess and said \\"I think it‚Äôs partly because she‚Äôs such an effective wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, whereas every other villain proudly owns their evil. But mostly it‚Äôs Georgia Chara‚Äôs performance, which combines tenderness and ruthlessness in a way I‚Äôve never seen before. WAIT. Yes I have. Jess is like that bunny rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, that no one has the good sense to be afraid of because it looks so cute and sweet and innocent.\\" References Fictional Australian people Television characters introduced in 2014 Fictional kidnappers Fictional nannies Fictional child killers Wentworth (TV series) characters ","title":"Jess Warner"},{"id":"48758571","text":"Lichtenau is a ghost town in Coshocton County, in the U.S. state of Ohio.

This site has been of significance to research on African archaeological history and anatomically modern human prehistory because it was occupied during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. Evidence of modern human presence in the cave date back to 200,000 BP. The term ‚Äòhaua‚Äô describes a typical cave structure of the local coastal area, which has been formed in its present shape by erosion processes of the sea during the early stage of the Pleistocene. Location and environment Haua Fteah is from the coast and found near the northern side of the plateau at the base of the Jebel Akhdar (or Green Mountain). The entrance faces north towards the Mediterranean sea. Stratigraphy and layout Haua Fteah cave Haua Fteah is high by wide on the north entrance with an span on the interior roofed portion of the cave. The horizontal stratigraphic layers are defined by the types of sediment contained in each layer and is supported by using radiocarbon dating techniques. The geological time scale at Haua Fteah shows major climatic changes that occurred during the Pleistocene. During the final stage of the Riss-Wurm interglacial period the shoreline was six meters above the present sea level. The second major stage is that in which the sea level was twenty meters below current sea level. Discovered and research Haua Fteah was first discovered in 1948 by Charles McBurney. McBurney and his team excavated the site from 1950 to 1955. Excavations were not done after 1955 until the most recent excavation in 2007. Since McBurney's excavations, there had been much erosion in this cave and heavy sedimentary layers had deposited over the original site as well. A recent project called the Cyrenaica Prehistory Project (CPP), run by Graeme Barker of Cambridge, began in 2007. The goal of this program is to expand knowledge and understanding of the cave's sequence of use and the history of environmental changes and how humans had adapted to those changes. The CPP attempts to reconstruct the history of climate, environment, and human activity at Haua Fteah. The project plans on gaining insight to these areas through geomorphological, palaeoecological, and archaeological studies inside the cave and from the surrounding landscape. A few questions that the CPP aims to answer include, \\"When did anatomically modern humans first arrive on Africa's northern shores? How did they and earlier populations deal with the effects of profound and often abrupt climatic change? Was \`behavioral modernity' critical to their successful colonization of North Africa? When, how, and why did farming develop in the Holocene?\\" as outlined by Cambridge University. From 2007 through 2013 there has been 7 completed excavation seasons by the CPP. Account of excavations The investigation of this site was started in 1951 in a sounding trench on the western side of the cave, which was 10 x 10 x 2 meters deep. In 1952, the second sounding trench was excavated horizontally atop the first trench that was 7 x 6 x 5.5 meters deep. Finally a deep sounding trench that was 3.8 X1.6 X 6.5 meters deep was excavated which gave the total excavation depth to be 14 meters deep. The CPP extended these findings by recovering more tools similar to those mentioned by McBurney. Finds, artifacts and remains There are seven distinct cultural phases determined by McBurney from these excavated layers. Cultural remnants of this site in the uppermost layer include hearths with shallow depressions that were most likely used for cooking fires and midden deposits. The original carbon dates from McBurney's excavation were obtained from samples of wood charcoal and bone fragments. Many original samples from McBurney's excavation and material from the most recent excavations were evaluated and confirmed by using several recent dating techniques during the CPP. The first and earliest phase had the flake and blade artifacts which date back to 80 to 65,000 years ago (80-65 kya). The second phase from 19 to 28 feet deep contained the Levalloiso-Mousterian flints dated from 65 to 40 kya with current dating techniques suggest these finds are closely dated from 73 to 43 kya. At the depth of 23 feet a modern human mandible was discovered which date between 73 and 65 kya. Abundant evidence of the Levalloiso-Mousterian blade industry is found during the second stage of climactic change shows that there is no established tradition in blade making among these people during this time. There were small hearths, food and bone accumulations also found in this phase. The fragment from the human mandible was found in August 1952. The fragments recovered were the left ascending ramus and a part of the condylar process with the second and third molars attached. The wisdom tooth had emerged but was not exposed for long, indicating that this specimen was in young adulthood, suggested from eighteen to twenty-five, at death. The middle of the bone is well intact but the lateral portion is partially destroyed. From the technical measurements of this fragment, it was thought that this specimen is closely linked to Neanderthals but more recent research, as determined the mandible fragments, are from a fully modern human or Homo sapiens. Phase three, layers from 18 to 9 feet down contained 'Dabban' blades that are 40 to 15 kya. A Dabban is an early type of blade industry called a blade-and-burin industry. This type of blade is thought to be the oldest blade of the Upper Paleolithic and is only found in Haua Fteah and another nearby site. The origins of the Dabban is still unknown completely. In phase 4, the 8 to 7 feet layers, a midden exists that mainly contains mammal bones and teeth, large amounts of limpet and cockle shells and land snails. This phase was also characterized by Later Stone Age microlithic tools dated to 14 to 10 kya. Mesolithic microlithic tools that are between 10 and 7 kya were mainly found in phase five (7 to 6 feet down) and there was presence of ceramics. Phase six (from 5 to 4 feet down) contained Neolithic pottery fragments and domesticated animal bones dated between 7 and 4.7 thousand years old. Flint fragments are found as well as finished tools, flake-scrapers, arrow-heads, a bifacial knife, trihedral pressure-flaked rods and drill heads. The presence of decorated ostrich eggs and pierced sea shells are also common in this phase. The piercing of these shells are thought to be for reasons of consumption and were carried out by small bladed tools. The seventh and most recent phase, from 4 to 0 feet down contained structures dating back to the Roman era and animal keeping was indicated. Hearths can be identified and some pottery fragments of local and Roman origin were found. Discussion and implications North African prehistory is often a subject of common debate in several areas including modern human dispersal, their adaptations to climate changes and agricultural developments. Haua Fteah lends tremendous information to such debates because of its continuous and long term occupation by humans. Although there were some excavations started by McBurney and now continued by the CPP, there are still many more excavations needed to clarify and support the current findings.

The conflict ended when the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma disbanded following the Fall of Communism and the ousting of the Burmese socialist dictatorship.  Timeline   WWII  The CPB fought for independence from the United Kingdom and against the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II, prior to the eruption of civil conflict in Myanmar. While in Insein prison in July 1941, Thakin Soe and Than Tun had co-authored the Insein Manifesto, which declared fascism as the major enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British and the establishment of a broad coalition alliance that should include the Soviet Union. It followed the Popular Front line advanced by the Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov, at the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935. This was against the prevailing opinion of the Dobama Movement, including Thakin Aung San, who had secretly left Myanmar with a group of young men, who later became known as the Thirty Comrades, to receive military training from the Japanese and founded the Burma Independence Army (BIA), later renamed the Burma Defence Army (BDA) and subsequently the Burma National Army (BNA), whom fought Allied Forces. A puppet government was set up during the occupation by the Japanese on 1 August 1943. Soe had gone underground in the Irrawaddy Delta to organize armed resistance soon after the invasion, and Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on intelligence to Soe. Other communist leaders Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe made contact in July 1942 with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India. In January 1944 at a secret meeting near Dedaye in the Delta, the CPB successfully held its First Congress chaired by Soe. The Communists were in the forefront of the armed resistance which subsequently became a national uprising on 27 March 1945, led by the BNA under the command of General Aung San. The communist commander Ba Htoo of the northwest command based in Mandalay started the rebellion three weeks earlier on 8 March. The CPB together with the BNA and the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP, later renamed the Socialist Party), had formed the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO) at a meeting in Pegu in August 1944; it was transformed into the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) a year later after the defeat of Japan and the return of the British colonial administration to continue the fight for independence. The party that had started with a small group of men now became a major legal political party from 1945 until 1948 when Burma gained independence from Britain.  Faction split  In February 1946 Thakin Soe denounced the leadership, accusing them of Browderism, the form of revisionism espoused by Earl Browder, leader of the American Communist Party, who proposed that armed struggle would no longer be necessary, as world fascism and imperialism had been weakened, making constitutional methods a real option to achieve \\"national liberation\\". Thein Pe, who had replaced Soe as secretary general, was the leader responsible for the policy paper on strategy entitled Toward Better Mutual Understanding and Greater Cooperation written in India and adopted at the party's Second Congress at Bagaya Road, Rangoon in July 1945. Soe broke away from the CPB to form a splinter group called the Communist Party (Burma) or the \\"red flags\\". The majority remained with Thakins Than Tun and Thein Pe and continued to co-operate with the AFPFL; the main party became known as the white flag communists although the title has never been officially accepted. During negotiations the British noticed that Than Tun was the thinker behind Aung San as he referred to his brother-in-law repeatedly for his opinion. Also dubbed 'Thein-Than Communists' in the popular press, in the end they failed to achieve 'Leftist Unity' with Aung San and the Socialists led by U Nu and Kyaw Nyein within the AFPFL.  Post-WWII  Soe and Ba Tin had traveled to India in September 1945 to talk to the Communist Party of India where Browderism was already under attack, and Soe came back convinced that armed struggle was the only way forward. Amidst widespread strikes starting with the Rangoon Police and mass rallies, the new British Governor Sir Hubert Rance offered Aung San and the others seats in the Executive Council which after an initial refusal was taken up in September 1946. The CPB had by now abandoned the Browderist line, and a rift that had opened up between the party and Aung San with the socialists culminated in Than Tun being forced to resign as general secretary of the AFPFL in July of that year, a position he had held since its inception. The party was finally expelled from the AFPFL on 2 November after the communists had accused Aung San and the socialists of 'kneeling before imperialism', selling out by joining the Executive Council, and calling off the general strike. In February 1947, Ba Thein Tin and communist student leader Aung Gyi attended the British Empire Conference of Communist Parties in London, the first time the CPB took part in an international communist forum. After denouncing the elections to the Constituent Assembly that took place the following April, the party fielded 25 junior candidates but won just 7 seats. The assassination of Aung San and his cabinet members on 19 July stunned the CPB as much as the rest of the country, but the party was still anxious to build a united front with the AFPFL to drive the British out of Burma, convinced that the assassination was an imperialist plot to stop Aung San from achieving Leftist Unity. Thakin Nu concluded negotiations that Aung San had started with the British premier Clement Attlee in London, and the Nu-Attlee Treaty of October 1947 was condemned as a sham by the communists, the bone of contention in particular being the Let Ya-Freeman Defence Agreement, appended as an annexe to the treaty. It provided for an initial period of three years for a British military training mission to remain in the country and a possible future military alliance with Britain. This was to the CPB proof of British intention to subvert Burma's sovereignty and Nu's capitulation.  Beginning of conflict  On 8 November 1947, Nu called for a new coalition of socialists, the CPB and the People's Volunteer Organisation (PVO) formed from the demobbed war veterans by Aung San as his own paramilitary force. When it failed Nu accused the communists of gathering arms for an insurrection. The impact of communist campaigning against the treaty left its mark in Burma's decision not to join the British Commonwealth. The party's Burma-born Bengali theoretician Goshal's thesis in December titled On the Present Political Situation and Our Tasks set out a revolutionary strategy reviving the slogan 'final seizure of power' from the previous January, and called for a 'national rising to tear up the treaty of slavery', nationalisation of all British and foreign assets, the abolition of all forms of landlordism and debt, the dismantling of the state bureaucracy and its replacement with a people's government, and alliances and trade agreements with 'democratic China, fighting Vietnam and Indonesia' and other democratic countries resisting 'Anglo-American imperialist domination'. A twofold strategy would be followed: an escalating campaign of strikes by workers and government employees in Rangoon and other cities, and the establishment of \\"liberated\\" areas in the countryside to be defended by Red Guards consisting of PVOs trained in guerilla warfare. February 1948 saw a wave of strikes in Rangoon by the All Burma Trade Union Congress (ABTUC) backed by the CPB, and in March a 75,000 strong mass rally by the All Burma Peasants Organisation (ABPO) at Pyinmana. Nu gave the order to arrest the communist leaders convinced that they were planning an uprising on Resistance Day, 27 March, only to find the CPB headquarters at Bagaya empty on the morning of 28 March; his quarry had flown to their stronghold Pyinmana to start an armed revolution. The CPB was not however officially outlawed until October 1953.  Civil war  Within eight months of independence Burma plunged into an all out civil war. Soe's red flag communists had already started a rebellion, so had the Rakhine nationalists led by the veteran monk U Seinda as well as the Muslim mujahids in Rakhine. The PVO had split into White-band and Yellow-band factions; the majority White-band PVO led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the Thirty Comrades, and Bo Po Kun, joined the insurrection in July. Nu's government deployed the Karen and Kachin Rifles to suppress the communist uprising, and took Pyay, Thayetmyo and Pyinmana during the latter half of 1948. The Karen National Union (KNU) rebelled at the end of January 1949 when the Army Chief of Staff Gen. Smith Dun, an ethnic Karen was replaced by Gen. Ne Win, a socialist commander and senior member of the Thirty Comrades after Aung San and Bo Let Ya. The Mon joined the Karen. The Pa-O in the Shan State also rose up. Three regiments of the Burma Rifles also went underground led by communist commanders Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo Ye Htut, all members of the Thirty Comrades, forming the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA). The CPB's appraisal of Burma as a 'semi-colonial semi-feudal' state led to the Maoist line of establishing guerilla bases among the peasants in the countryside as opposed to mobilising the urban proletariat, although it continued to support above-ground leftist opposition parties such as the Burma Workers and Peasants Party (BWPP) led by trade union leaders Thakins Lwin and Chit Maung, and dubbed 'crypto-communists' or 'red socialists' by the Rangoon press. They tried unsuccessfully to bring the communists back into mainstream politics, and in 1956 formed an alliance called the National United Front to contest the election on a 'peace ticket' winning 35% of the vote though only a small number of seats. The politburo's decision to fight 'for the very existence of our party' at a clandestine central committee meeting in April 1948 in Rangoon was confirmed the following month by the full plenum of the CC at Hpyu 120 miles north of the capital. The headquarters of the CPB remained on the move mostly in the forests and hills along the Sittang River valley, Pyinmana ‚Äì Yamethin area in central Burma, sometimes north into the Three M triangle (Mandalay ‚Äì Meiktila ‚Äì Myingyan). Debt was abolished, and farming and trading co-operatives established in areas under their control. One year into the insurrection its forces were reorganised along Maoist lines into a main force, mobile guerilla forces and local people's militia, with the command shared between military and political commissars. In September 1950 the People's Army (PA) was formed by merging the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) with Bo Zeya's Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA). Its regular forces consisted of four main divisions, each with 1,000 men under arms. The Karen National Union (KNU) with its 'reactionary feudal leadership' was regarded as being used by the British to destabilise the Union by both the AFPFL government and the communists, although Than Tun had supported the earlier Rakhine nationalist rebellion against the British, the Shan struggle against the feudal autocracy, and the Karen right to self-determination. The civil war was thus waged from three sides: the AFPFL, the Communist-PVOs and the ethnic minority nationalists with the KNU threatening Rangoon itself in early 1949. Nu estimated government casualties alone at 3,424 dead including 1,352 army personnel in 1952.  1950s  The communist military offensive began to lose traction, and in 1955, the CPB put forward the 'Peace and Unity' proposal. It combined a strong peace movement by its above-ground supporters and sympathizers and proposals by Than Tun to the AFPFL government in 1956. War-weariness had led to a desire for peace, and the move was welcomed by both the leftist opposition and conservative groups in Rangoon. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, the revered veteran nationalist leader, formed an Internal Peace Committee which in 1958 was allowed by the government to speak on the CPB's behalf. The results of the 1956 election, where the National United Front did very well on a peace ticket, had also given the AFPFL a jolt. On the international front, US support of the Kuomintang (KMT) forces, that had crossed over from Yunnan province into northeastern Burma after Mao's victory in China, had resulted in Burma's refusal to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). Zhou Enlai visited Rangoon on his return from the Geneva Conference on Indo-China to meet Nu, and issued a joint communique reaffirming the 'five principles of peaceful co-existence' and the right of people 'to choose their own state system'; Nu repaid the visit the same year receiving the assurance that Chinese leaders had no contact with the CPB. Ne Win also led a military delegation to Beijing in 1957, and met Chairman Mao Zedong. A week-long visit in December 1955 by Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev appeared to endorse Burma as a model non-aligned, socialist Third World country developing at its own pace; Burma was a strong supporter of the 1955 Bandung Conference. Joseph Stalin's death and the shift in Soviet policy under Khrushchev contributed to the mood of national reconciliation. Now U Nu turned the communist peace offensive to his advantage and came up with a very successful 'arms for democracy' offer. Tatmadaw (Burma Armed Forces) offensives in early 1956, Operation Aung Thura (Valiant Victory) in Pakokku area and Operation Aung Tayza (Glorious Victory) in Pathein area, had been partly successful. The year 1958 saw mass surrenders of first the Rakhine nationalists led by U Seinda, next the Pa-O, Mon, and Shan communists, but most importantly the PVO led by Bo Po Kun. The official figure was 5,500 armed insurgents that 'entered the light', of which about 800 were white flag communists mainly in Sittwe, northern Rakhine State. The one crucial exception was the KNU. Yugoslavia became the primary arms supplier for the Burmese government beginning in 1952, when the Burmese reached out to Belgrade due to the slow and uneasy support from the United States and the United Kingdom. The two nations became very close as a result, and the Yugoslav National Army sent advisors to aid in the front lines. The sudden strong relationship between Burma and Yugoslavia prompted concern among the Americans, who worried the Yugoslav support would strengthen Marxist ideology in the government.FRUS, 1952-54, vol. XII, part II, East Asia and the Pacific, pp. 194-195. General Ne Win, who previously sought support solely from the West, was impressed with the speed of the Yugoslav-Burmese cooperation, and traveled to Belgrade in 1953.NARA, RG 59, 690B.9321/12-2253, Memorandum of Conversation between General Ne Win and the Army and Air Attach√©s of the U.S. Embassy in Burma, December 22nd 1953. pp. 108-09.  1960s  In 1963 Ne Win as head of the Union Revolutionary Council government launched a peace offensive starting with a general amnesty on 1 April. Bo Ye Htut, a member of the Thirty Comrades and central military committee of the CPB who had been to Rangoon on a secret peace mission before the 1958 AFPFL split, took the offer together with Bo Ye Maung and Bo Sein Tin. The KNU split in the same month between the KNUP and the Karen Revolutionary Council (KRC) led by Saw Hunter Tha Hmwe. The first insurgent group to arrive in Rangoon was the red flag delegation in June later joined by Thakin Soe himself from Arakan in August. After just three meetings the talks were abruptly ended by the RC on 20 August and the red flag communists were flown back to Sittwe. Three CPB teams arrived in July and September by air from China led by Bo Zeya, Yebaw Aung Gyi, Thakins Pu and Ba Thein Tin. These 'Beijing returnees' were allowed to travel to the party's jungle headquarters in the Bago Yoma near Paukkaung where the leadership, reunited after 15 years, held an historic meeting of the Central Committee. Talks began on 2 September after the CPB delegation headed by the general secretary Yebaw Htay and the People's Army's chief of staff Bo Zeya arrived on 28 August. A second team headed by Thakin Zin, politbureau member and secretary of the NDUF which agreed to negotiate as one team, arrived on 20 September. Meetings with the CPB and NDUF overshadowed those with other nationalities such as the Shan and Kachin delegations.  Collapse of peace talks  Talks broke down on 14 November, when the Revolutionary Council government demanded that: # All troops must be concentrated in a designated area. # No one can leave without permission. # All organisational work must stop. # All fund-raising must stop. Expectations had been running high, and the People's Peace Committee, set up by the NUF and supported by Thakin Kodaw Hmaing and former brigadier Kyaw Zaw, staged a Six-District Peace March in early November from Minhla to Rangoon. The marchers were cheered and applauded along the entire route by large crowds chanting anti-government slogans, and given food parcels collected by the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) and the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU). When they reached Rangoon at a mass rally of 200,000 in front of city hall, speakers openly supported the NDUF's demand to keep its weapons and territory. Although at first the CPB and NDUF had misinterpreted Ne Win's peace offensive as a sign of weakness desperate for a solution, once they arrived in Rangoon they realised it was going to be a mainly cosmetic exercise. They therefore took the opportunity to re-establish contacts and meet family and friends.  Crackdown  Over 900 people were arrested in the immediate aftermath, mostly BWPP and NUF activists, but also Thaton Hla Pe, leader of the Union Pa-O National Organisation (UPNO) and formerly of the insurgent Pa-O National Organisation (PNO), who was one of the main organisers of the peace march, and Nai Non Lar leader of the former Mon People's Front (MPF). By the end of the year over 2,000 were believed to be in prison. Almost the entire executive committees of the RUSU and the ABFSU fled to join the CPB.  1970s  In November 1978 Thakin Ba Thein Tin presented a ‚Äòpolitical report‚Äô at a historic meeting of the politburo held in Panghsang, unanimously approved at the CC meeting in early 1979. It formed the basis of the resolutions passed in September 1985 at the CPB's Third Congress, 40 years since the last one in Rangoon, attended by just 170 of the party's estimated 5,000 members. * The party's past errors of the 1955 ‚Äòrevisionist‚Äô line and the 1964 ‚Äòintra-party revolutionary line‚Äô were now admitted. * Ne Win's regime was characterised as representing ‚Äòimperialism, feudal-landlordism and bureaucratic capitalism‚Äô. * The primacy of the armed struggle, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Mao Zedong Thought and China's example was reaffirmed. * Soviet ‚Äòsocialism-imperialism‚Äô and Vietnam's ‚Äòhegemonism‚Äô were to be resisted as much as ‚ÄòUS imperialism‚Äô. The CPB had supported the Khmer Rouge and written to both the Vietnamese and Cambodian parties urging them to settle their dispute peacefully. Ne Win, for his part in playing the China card, also happened to be the first head of state to pay a visit to Phnom Penh after the Khmer Rouge came to power. The party's general programme was drawn up in the light of ‚Äòthe experiences of the last 30 years of the armed struggle‚Äô. * It warned against ‚Äòsectarianism‚Äô and ‚Äòleftist‚Äô and ‚Äòrightist deviationism‚Äô. * The party's constitution was revised to ‚Äòsuit the changing conditions‚Äô of the world. * New ‚Äòparty building‚Äô, ‚Äòmilitary‚Äô and ‚Äòagricultural‚Äô lines were adopted. ** Party membership had failed to fulfill the 1964 directive of recruiting at least one member from every village. ** The new military line would be ‚Äòstrategic defence‚Äô at a time when the party was weak and the enemy strong. ** Because Burma was still a ‚Äòbackward semi- colonial, semi-feudal, agrarian country with uneven political and economic development‚Äô, ‚Äòagrarian revolution‚Äô with the slogan 'land to the tillers' was still the basis of a ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs war‚Äô waged by building up Red Power areas and encircling the cities. In insisting on not ‚Äòcopying the October Revolution of Russia‚Äô by calling a ‚Äògeneral strike and uprising‚Äô (in Burmese ‚Äì thabeikson thabonhta), it appeared to have ignored the recent upheavals of 1974‚Äì76 in the cities.  1980‚Äì81 peace parley  Shortly after Myanmar resigned from the Non-Aligned Movement in protest against Soviet and Vietnamese manipulation at the September 1979 Havana Conference, the Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua paid a visit to Rangoon. Ne Win announced an amnesty in 1980 which saw the return of U Nu and others from Thailand. The CPB responded with an attack on Mong Yawng, but proposed talks in September after letting the amnesty expire. The first meeting took place in Beijing in October between the teams led by Ba Thein Tin and Ne Win who paid a surprise visit to China leaving the Kachin delegation in the middle of the talks in Rangoon. At the second meeting headed by Thakin Pe Tint for the CPB and Maj. Gen. Aye Ko for the BSPP the following May in Lashio, three new conditions were put on the table by Aye Ko: # The abolition of the CPB. # The abolition of the People's Army under the command of the CPB. # The abolition of all the ‚Äòliberated areas‚Äô. The CPB was told that according to Article 11 of the 1974 Constitution which had established Burma as a one-party state there was no place for another political party. Ne Win ended the peace talks on 14 May and let the ceasefire deadline of 31 May with the KIO pass without replying to the Kachin position. There had been no ceasefire agreement with the CPB. The VOPB began to broadcast appeals for ending the civil war, developing democracy and building national unity in a new multi-party system. The CPB still commanded 15,000 troops in the north- east, and the Tatmadaw, after resuming the Operation King Conqueror belatedly in 1982 and having suffered losses amounting to several hundred in the Kengtung-Tangyang area from CPB counter-attacks, finally retreated. Both sides now faced another challenge in the rising strength of the National Democratic Front (NDF) formed in 1976, pointedly excluding the Bamar, by the ethnic insurgencies uniting the Karen, Mon, Kachin, Shan,Pa-O, Karenni, Kayan, Wa and Lahu, particularly with the return of the KIO in 1983 after its separate peace talks with the BSPP failed. This finally led to the CPB reaching an agreement with the NDF in 1986.  8888 Uprising  The government of Myanmar heavily blamed the CPB for the tremendous upheavals in 1988, the economic collapse that resulted in the country being recognised by the UN as one of the Least Developed Countries in the world in 1987 and simmering discontent over the years compounded by yet another round of ‚Äòdemonetisation‚Äô culminated in a great outburst of angry protests and demonstrations countrywide, which led to a national uprising on 8 August 1988. It was brutally crushed by the Tatmadaw, killing thousands of civilians and this time in the cities alleging communist infiltration. Kyin Maung, then politburo member in charge of the CPB underground Task Force 4828 (named after 28 March 1948 insurrection), was forthright in admitting the presence of cadres in the cities, including Thet Khaing, son-in-law of Kyaw Zaw, but asserted that the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) had greatly exaggerated the party's 'leading role' in the uprising. The party had begun advocating a multi-party democracy system after 1981, and it was not until 28 March 1988, the anniversary of the insurrection, that it called for a provisional government composed of various opposition parties, forces and personages. The students‚Äô call for an interim government to end one-party rule and to hold multi-party elections never materialised, as U Nu and Aung San Suu Kyi could not agree to work together, and this failure to achieve a united opposition sealed the fate of the uprising.

The author identifies himself as \\"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ\\", and the epistle is traditionally attributed to Peter the Apostle, but there are hypotheses that it is a work of Peter's followers in Rome between the years 70 and 100. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 25 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Papyrus 72 (3rd/4th century) * Papyrus 125 (3rd/4th century; extant verses 23‚Äì25) * Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (ca. 450; extant verses 3‚Äì25) * Papyrus 74 (7th century; extant verses 1‚Äì2,7‚Äì8,13,19‚Äì20,25) Old Testament references *1 Peter 1:24‚Äì25: Greeting (1:1‚Äì2) Location of some places in Anatolia (Asia Minor) mentioned in 1 Peter 1:1 Verse 1 :Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, :To the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, NKJV The specific region named in this verse would cover most of Asia Minor north and west of the Taurus mountains, which was attested in Pliny's letters to Trajan (c. 112 CE) to have a significant number of Christians in towns and countryside of the area. God's plan of salvation meets believers' every need (1:3‚Äì9) This part contains a form of blessing, which not only praises God, but lays out the main themes of the epistle. Peter follows the pattern of some of Paul's epistles in pouring thanksgiving to God for His blessings, and gives eleven reasons for praising God: # He is the Father of Lord Jesus Christ (verse 3) # He has given new birth (cf. ; verse 3) # the motive for giving the new birth is his mercy (verse 3) # the result of the mercy is a living hope (verse 3) # the means to this hope is the resurrection of Jesus (verse 3) # the object of this hope is an inheritance (verse 4) # this inheritance cannot be destroyed by hostile elements nor defiled by outside pollution, and cannot fade by wasting from within (verse 4) # this inheritance is kept in heaven for the believers (verse 4) # the believers are shielded (\\"garrisoned\\") for the inheritance by the power of God (verse 5) # the means of the shielding is faith (cf. ) to hold on to the promises of God (verse 5) # the final goal is a salvation to be revealed by God in the last time, when Jesus is revealed (verse 5, 7). How the salvation was made known to the believers (1:10‚Äì12) The salvation is made known by the work of the Holy Spirit (verse 12), which is the Spirit of Christ (verse 10), who led the prophets to foretell the grace that was to come (verse 10), even to foresee the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow (verse 11; cf. ; ; Isaiah 53; ), but not to find out when and how that would happen. Redemption into the Christ Group (1:13‚Äì21) The addressees are said to be set apart for God from the surrounding culture, into the holiness.

Newton graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Columbia Law School, where he was a James Kent Scholar and a Senior Editor of the Columbia Law Review. After graduating from law school in 1992, he clerked for Judge Carolyn Dineen King of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

In ‚ÄúCapital Punishment: Texas Could Learn a Lot from Florida\\" (1998), Newton surmised that Texas's high actual execution numbers could be attributed to three factors at that time: the way judges were elected, a weak public defender system, and a flawed jury system that did not allow for the consideration of mitigating evidence.

The genus contains a single described species, Electropodagrion szwedoi. History and classification Electropodagrion is known from a solitary fossil, which is an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Baltic amber. The amber was recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. Estimates of the age date between 37 million years old, for the youngest sediments and 48 million years old. This age range straddles the middle Eocene, ranging from near the beginning of the Lutetian to the beginning of the Pribonian. At the time of study, the holotype was part of the paleoentomology collections housed by the Museum of Amber Inclusions, University of Gda≈Ñsk, in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. It was first studied by paleoentomologists Dany Azar of the Lebanese University and Andr√© Nel of the Mus√©um National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle. Their 2008 type description of the genus and species was published in the natural sciences journal Annales de la Soci√©t√© Entomologique de France. The genus name was coined as a combination of the Greek elektron meaning \\"amber\\" and podagrion the root of Megapodagrion, type genus of Megapodagrionidae. The specific epithet szwedoi was coined as a patronym honoring paleoentomologist Jacek Szwedo. Description The E. szwedoi fossil is fragmentary, with only the upper half of one wing, one leg and the thorax with three wing bases preserved. All the wings are similar in structure and appearance, having an approximate length of and a maximum width of about . The nodus, notch on the leading edge of the forewings, is placed from the base, and the pterostigma is further up the wing. The postnodal veins and the postsubnodal veins are aligned, a feature seen in Coenagrionomorpha damselflies, while the relatively square and shortened pterostigma preclude the genus belonging to Hypolestidae.

She initiated employment and practical training for the poor, and promoted the building of affordable housing and hospitals. She is regarded as a forerunner of modern German social work.  Biography  First society established by Amalie Sieveking, Stiftstra√üe 65, St. Georg, Hamburg Amalie Sieveking was born in Hamburg, the daughter of the Hamburg senator Heinrich Christian Sieveking (died 1809) and his wife Caroline Louise, n√©e Volkmann (died 1799); her grandfather was also a senator. After her father's death she was taken in by her uncle's family, supported by a small senatorial pension, and cared for their invalid son. She took up the education of her nieces, and founded a school for girls, many of whom eventually became tutors to prominent families. She also taught girls in poorhouses on Sundays. The Free churches (Protestant religious bodies in each country) served as an inspiration to German Lutherans to further the care of the sick, and led to the first involvement of German Protestant women in charitable work. While Sieveking's early education was shaped by the Enlightenment, after her confirmation and the death of her brother she turned toward the Christian revival that was sweeping Germany, and came under the influence of popular theologians such as Johann Hinrich Wichern, Johann Wilhelm Rautenberg, and Matthias Claudius. Particularly Rautenberg, who had made St. Georg, Hamburg a center of new piety, was of great influence in steering Sieveking (and others, including Wichern and Heinrich Matthias Sengelmann) towards charitable work and making her a deaconess. Sieveking decided as early as 18 to remain single, and vowed to create a religious order of charitable sisters. When cholera broke out in Hamburg in 1831, she volunteered to work as a nurse in the poorhouses. She advertised for other high-ranking women to join her, but none did, so she went alone. Soon she found herself in charge of the nursing staff. On May 23, 1832, with twelve other women, instead of a religious society she founded the Weiblicher Verein f√ºr Armen- und Krankenpflege, a pioneering diaconal benevolent society that aimed to help people help themselves by providing \\"material and spiritual assistance\\" to impoverished sick people and their families. Workers were enjoined to preserve the dignity of those they helped, and to assist with clothing and food. The head of the society was to be elected annually. Sieveking rejected any suggestion that a male head was required. Regarding charity work for women, she noted: \\"In a great many cases, namely those of the upper class, household and other domestic responsibilities do not offer the female side of the family a sufficient arena for the sum of their energies.\\" In 1840 she founded the Amalienstift, which had a children's hospital and a poorhouse. She stated her goal as: \\"To me, at least as important were the benefits which [work with the poor] seemed to promise for those of my sisters who would join me in such a work of charity. The higher interest of my sex were close to my heart\\". Her organization inspired others of a similar nature in Germany, and over the next sixteen years 45 societies were established affiliated with Sieveking's. These societies provided an opportunity to women of higher echelons of society to help in diaconal work without being designated as deaconesses. Already in 1840 Sieveking had declined the position of a superintendent of the in Berlin, offered to her by Pastor Fliedner of Kaiserswerth. Sieveking Mausoleum in the Old Cemetery in Hamburg-Hamm In 1836, Theodor Fliedner was influenced by Sieveking when he established the first Protestant hospital in Kaiserswerth, which evolved into a leading modern nursing school. He was also responsible for establishing the deaconesses in Germany, as an order of nurses which attracted widespread enrollment and recognition. Florence Nightingale, the British nurse of Crimean War fame, was trained at Kaiserswerth and was influenced by the work of Sieveking. She probably met Sieveking in London through her friend Christian von Bunsen. Nightingale made nursing a profession of trained middle-class \\"women in white\\". A very pious person, Sieveking anonymously published tracts, Betrachtungen (Observations) and Besch√§ftigungen mit der heiligen Schrift (Considerations on Holy Writ). She described herself as a \\"rationalist mystic\\". She was influenced in her theology by August Hermann Francke; while she showed solidarity with those on the margins of society, she did not show any political support for class reform. Sieveking lived off the senatorial pension and two small inheritances, and maintained her independence. After her death her work was continued by her friend Elise Averdieck (1808-1907). Her autobiography, titled Hanseatic Philanthropist, was reviewed by the poet Sophie Schwab, who found a \\"delightful resonance\\" in its Christian spirit. She died in Hamburg and is interred in the at the Dreifaltigkeitskirche (Trinity Church) in Hamburg-Hamm, in a mausoleum for the Sieveking and Chapeaurouge families that was built by her cousin Karl Sieveking and designed by architect Alexis de Chateauneuf. 1955 stamp, from the series Helfer der Menschheit Legacy Her feastday in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints is April 1.Amalie Sieveking im √∂kumenischen Heiligenlexikon The Amalie Sieveking Hospital in Hamburg-Volksdorf is named for her; today it is part of the Albertinen- Diakoniewerk in Hamburg.

He claims that progress has been made following media reports on the subject in previous years. Suter has supported the interests of the fishing industry, challenged the merits and planning of South Australian marine parks and criticised South Australian marine scientists and fisheries management authorities. He has stated that he believed that the introduction of state- managed marine parks represented \\"dangerous harm\\" for regional South Australian communities, and rejected claims about the projected economic potential for marine park eco-tourism in his region in a study commissioned by the Conservation Council of South Australia. He referred to the process of developing regional impact statements related to marine parks as a \\"farce\\" and described the statements as \\"ludicrous rubbish\\". He has expressed concern about marine parks reducing areas accessible to commercial fishing, including marine scale fish and southern rock lobster fisheries. Suter has been critical of SARDI's fisheries stock assessment processes, and in 2015 accused SARDI's whale researchers of \\"chasing whales to exhaustion\\" when tagging seven animals in the Great Australian Bight.  Personal life  Suter is a boat owner and record-holding recreational fisherman. He holds a Game Fishing Association of Australia national record for a 31 kilogram mulloway caught from land on 8 kilogram line near Ceduna in 1992. He also holds a South Australian record for a 31.2 kilogram mulloway caught on 6 kilogram line in 1986. He also holds further state records for catches of a 270 kilogram bronze whaler shark (15 kg line, 1987), a 26.4 kilogram western blue groper (15 kg line, 1987) and a 35 kilogram smooth stingray (6 kg line, 1985).

The UN consultants G√©rald Hanning and Vladimir Bodiansky introduced the concept of the building, a architectural composition, directly inspired by previous AT.BAT designs built in Morocco. Lu Ban Hap, then Chief Architect of the Municipality of Phnom Penh, was responsible for the site supervision. The White Building was designed to house moderate-income tenants, and was adopted by many artists who found the innovative design appealing. With the nearby Grey Building, designed by Vann Molyvann, it was initially built for athletes in the 1964 GANEFO (Games of the non-aligned forces) international sports event. After years of neglect and deterioration since the fall of the Khmer Rouge, the White Building was demolished in 2017. The building was composed of six blocks of concrete construction, three or four stories tall, connected by open bridge structures, along a double-loaded spine. It included stores and doctors' offices as well as 468 apartments. Tenants fled during the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s. After the defeat of the Khmer Rouge in 1979 the White Building was reoccupied by former tenants and squatters. It gradually declined and became known for poverty, drug use and prostitution. Its population in 2015 was about 2500. According to municipal authorities, the building was structurally deteriorating and is unsafe. Tenants used the high-ceilinged rooms to add lofts, and balconies were enclosed, obscuring the once-white building's design and also adding weight to the structure. Cracking appeared in 2015 after construction on an adjoining lot. Several proposals have been made to tear it down for redevelopment. Eviction orders were issued in July 2015. However, the building's status as an iconic New Khmer building stimulated preservation efforts. In July 2017, the almost 500 families still living in the White Building were moving out; the building was to be replaced by a 21-storey mixed-use development.

It was commissioned by the Libya-born Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. The Emperor Septimius Severus () ruled through a period of architectural revival. He was the first Emperor born in the provinces since Hadrian and Trajan. He was idolized for his military successes, having been declared emperor by his troops, and was well known for his use of militaristic power, perhaps the best known were his Parthian victories from 194‚Äì195. With the military success of the emperor came a dramatic building program in Rome as well as the emperor's city of birth, Leptis Magna, which is now a World Heritage site. Part of his building programs, erected to celebrate the triumph of the Parthian victories, were two arches in Rome as well as one in Leptis Magna. The commemorative arch of Leptis Magna stands as a testament to the Severan dynasty, military might, urban revitalization as well as divine acceptance. With the Emperor's significant presence in the province, it comes at no surprise that a triumphal arch was erected in Leptis Magna. While the exact date is not agreed upon, it is generally accepted that the Arch of Septimius Severus at Leptis Magna was erected on the occasion of the Severus‚Äô African tour in 203. Built as a tetrapylon, the four-way arch marks the intersection of the two most significant urban roads, the cardo, north-south direction, and the Decumanus Maximus, the main east-west thoroughfare of this once-prominent port city of the Roman Empire in Africa. The city as well as the arch fell into ruin and was abandoned after barbarian invasions of the late 5th century. Justinian later appropriated Leptis Magna, utilizing sculpture from the arch in his great basilica. Excavation The Arch of Septimius Severus at Leptis Magna, discovered in ruin after the First World War in 1928, once stood as a symbol of the Severan dynastic and militaristic program. When Giacomo Guidi found the arch, it was completely fragmented, showing only the base structure, buried underneath the sand. After extensive excavation and reconstruction, the grand arch appeared to have been decorated in ornate deeply drilled floral and iconographic programs. The central arch made of a limestone core and a marble facing featured elaborately decorated panels. There are four primary frieze panels, depicting the imperial family in scenes of the triumph, procession, sacrifice, and Concordia Augustorum. With the claim to rule justified only by military power, Septimius Severus worked to establish a dynasty and a dynastic succession; therefore, he placed a significant emphasis on the role of his family and his future. Decoration Beyond the central attic frieze, the arch is relatively uniform on all sides. Framed by eight Corinthian columns that support a broken pediment, the arch is ornate featuring the blending of Hellenistic elements. Not typical of Roman architecture, the Arch's broken pediment draws from an eastern tradition extending from Asia to Palestine. Besides, the columns are Corinthian pilasters decorated in deep-drilled vine scrolls, between which are trophies supported by captive barbarians. All eight spandrels bear Victory holding a wreath and a palm branch, commemorative of the triumph. Above the columns is a frieze decorated with acanthus above, which is a frieze of erotes holding a garland. All four exterior faces share these basic decorative elements, varying only in the central frieze decoration. The northeast frieze, facing the rival city of Leptis, Oea, depicts the triumph. Similar in representation to the Arch of Titus and The Arch of Marcus Aurelius, the program depicts galloping horses with riders in an attempted illusionistic manner. Like Titus, the togatus is depicted in a horizontal field, showing vivid movement as the togatus riders are shown with great attention to the detail in the fabric of their togatus. In front of these is the chariot driven by a quadriga, or four horses are shown in profile. The Chariot carries three central figures: Septimius Severus, Caracalla, and Geta, showing the dynastic succession. To legitimate their rule, the Severans assimilated themselves to the Antonines, the most recent dynasty to occupy the throne. therefore elements of their imperial arts perfectly attribute to his dynastic intentions. Although typical triumphal scenes depict a slave or Victory holding a crown above the victor, there is none present; instead, the chariot is decorated with images of Cyble, Hercules and Venus. The divine iconography aligns a contemporary scene with the divine, a symbolic program used by emperors such as Trajan as well as the alignment of both Roman and eastern deities. The Triumph is preceded by togatus accompanied by female captives. A similar pictorial program is followed on the other relief friezes. The costuming is deeply drilled as to show the definition of the folding with little attention paid to the body forms underneath. While elements of the arch are ‚Äúseveran baroque‚Äù they do not adhere to the baroque ideology of motion. The other reliefs depict ritual and civic activities involving the family. This seeks to show the succession of the family, as well as the military successes against the Parthians. The repetition of captives shows the significance of the victories and the approval of the gods. Both Roman and Provincial gods are present in the relief scenes, seeking to declare the role the Severans would play in Rome and their desire to aid the Provinces.

The dam is actually two dams separated by an area of higher land approximately 1.5 miles wide. Normally, no water is impounded behind the dams, they are strictly for flood control. However, during the spring runoff water will back up behind the northern dam. This has created a small oasis in the lowlands behind the dam. Both dams are earth-fill dams with coarse rubble on the faces to prevent erosion. The tops of both dams are 4058 feet above sea level. During a flood, each dam's reservoir is separate until the water reaches 4000 feet above sea level, at which point the two reservoirs combine to form a single large reservoir. Northern Dam The northern dam, also known as the Diamond A damhttp://www.spa.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/Recreation/TwoRiversDam.aspx or the first dam, is 5000 feet long and 95 feet tall. It is 525 feet wide at the base and 24 feet wide at the top. It crosses the Hondo River. At the base of the dam there is a flood control gate which can be closed to prevent flood waters from flowing downstream. The gate is normally left open to allow the river to flow freely. The gate is only closed when it is necessary to prevent flooding. This dam has a two lane gravel road across the top which is open to the public. The southern dam is accessed by crossing the northern dam. Southern Dam The southern dam, also known as the second dam, is 2950 feet long and 107 feet tall. It is 600 feet wide at the base and 18 feet wide at the top. It crosses the Rocky Arroyo, which is an intermittent stream. Rocky Arroyo doesn't normally have water flowing through it and the impoundment area behind the dam is much drier than the impoundment area behind the northern dam. History The city of Roswell suffered devastating floods in 1937, 1941, and 1954. After the 1954 flood, the US Congress passed the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 which authorized the Corps of Engineers to build dams to protect Roswell from floods.

Xian is currently part of Team Razer. He was the winner of Ultra Street Fighter 4 at DreamHack Winter 2015. At Capcom Cup 2015 he got third place after being eliminated by eventual runner-up Daigo Umehara.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ultra-street-fighter- iv-capcom-cup-2015-full-resul/1100-6432871/ He beat Yusuke Momochi at Final Round 18. Xian plays Gen as his character of choice, as his stances allowed Xian more options. He stated that Gen was a very underestimated character that people have compared to Dan Hibiki and have easily dismissed as weak. He won Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition at EVO 2013. Personal life Born in 1990 to mother Lee Siew Lian, a cashier, and private-hire car driver father, Xian has an elder brother Ho An De. The whole family lives in a one-room HDB flat. After completing his secondary school GCE Ordinary Level, Xian did odd jobs, such as cargo lifter, home mover and hawker assistant, before he enlisted for National Service. It made him realised that he was not suitable for a nine-to-five job. He wanted \\"to do what I liked as a living\\" even though he knew it seemed \\"like an impossible task to make gaming a career\\". In 2010, Xian met his girlfriend, Jen Tan, a tattoo artist, in an arcade who also played Street Fighter. Besides Tan, her parents are also supportive of his career. Career Xian's passion for gaming started at seven years old when he was in primary school. With only S$2 whenever he went to the arcade, he would stretch it for hours by getting better and better because winning the games would allow him to continue playing. He also derived a huge sense of satisfaction whenever he beat his friends and had carved out a name for himself. In 2008, Xian's friends asked him to return to the arcade to play the new and popular Street Fighter IV game. In 2009, after a series of competitions, Xian represented Singapore at the DreamHack gaming festival in Sweden. His second-placing at the festival convinced him to start travelling to compete around the world. However, his family and friends were not supportive as it was just after his National Service and he was without a job. It was around this time that Xian found a silent backer in Lenn Yang, a casual but passionate gamer, who saw online video clips of Xian in action overseas and wanted \\"to see if somebody from Singapore can really be the best player in the world\\". Personally, Yang sponsored Xian S$15,000 to S$20,000 a year for three years. In 2013, Xian became the world's best Street Fighter at the 2013 Evolution Championship Series in Las Vegas, beating 1,600 players to win the prize money of US$5,700. Although he won international fame at the most prestigious tournament in the world, the prize money could only last him for a few months, which made him consider turning professional. In 2014, he found sponsorship in Razer Inc. which allows him to play full-time. Now, his family and friends are supportive as he has won awards and can make a living just by gaming. His fame also brings him fans and monetary gains. Xian has 40,000 followers on Twitter and 15,000 on Facebook. He also earns appearance fees from gaming events and has sponsorships. For now, Xian hopes to stretch his career for as long as possible. He said, \\"I'll be playing games very competitively because this is what I've been doing...I'll be a pro-gamer for the rest of my life.

They are also crucial to the reconstruction of Proto-Arabic, since they show many features that are shared by epigraphic Old South Arabian and Classical Arabic. The common features set them apart from languages that are documented further south, such as Dadanitic and Taymanitic (see Characteristics below). Old Arabic in the Nabataean script is first attested in the Negev desert in the 1st century BC, but it becomes more frequent in the region after the decline of Safaitic and Hismaic. From the 4th century AD, Old Arabic inscriptions are attested from Northern Syria to the Hejaz, in a script that is intermediate between cursive Nabataean and the Kufic script of Islamic times. The urheimat of Proto-Arabic can thus be regarded as the frontier between northwest Arabia and the southern Levant. Characteristics There are several features shared by Classical Arabic, the varieties of Modern Arabic and the Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions that are unattested in any other Semitic language variety, including the Dadanitic and Taymanitic languages of the northern Hejaz. They are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor, Proto-Arabic. The following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic:Al-Jallad, A. (2015).

It is a small shrub with most of its above-ground parts covered with hairs which are tipped with a tiny yellow gland. It has a strong, bitter odour. Description Eremophila acrida is a small, densely branched shrub which grows to a height of about . It has an odour which is described as acrid, unpleasant or medicinally-scented. Its branches, leaves and green parts of the flowers are densely covered with hairs which have a yellow gland on the tip, sometimes giving the plant a coppery sheen. The leaves are lance-shaped, mostly long, wide, pointed and with the base tapering towards the stem. The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 triangular sepals which vary slightly in size from each other and are about long. The petals are long and are joined at their bases to form a bell-shaped tube. The tube is white to lilac or pink on the outside and reddish-brown from the base of the petal lobes to deep inside the tube. The inside and outside of the petal tube are hairy but the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous. There are four stamens which do not extend beyond the end of the tube. The fruit is hairy and an oval shape, about with raised ribs on its surface. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in the Eremophila and allied genera : a monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae from a specimen near Aileron. The specific epithet (acrida) is the Latinised version of the English word acrid meaning \\"sharply upleasant-smelling\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila mostly occurs in central and southern areas of the Northern Territory and more rarely in central to western Queensland. It grows in nutrient-poor soils often on rocky hillsides or in grasslands in association with mulga. Conservation status Eremophila acrida has been classified as \\"of least concern\\" by the Northern Territory Government Department of Land Resource Management. Use in horticulture This eremophila grows naturally where the heaviest rain falls in summer and its preferred growing conditions reflect that fact. It grows best in full sun, requires summer watering and is frost sensitive. It is difficult to propagate from cuttings, except in its natural range and grafting on to Myoporum needs to be done in the hottest months of the year.

After the Kuomintang (KMT) began its suppression of the Communists in 1927, Qian infiltrated the KMT secret service, and in 1931 intercepted a telegram reporting the arrest and defection of the Communist leader Gu Shunzhang. His quick reaction allowed the Communist leadership in Shanghai to evacuate, and he was credited with saving the lives of top leaders including Zhou Enlai, later the Premier of China. Zhou called Qian and his fellow agents Li Kenong and Hu Di \\"the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party.\\" Qian was killed in 1935 during the Long March. He was the father of Li Lili, one of China's most popular film stars in the 1930s. Early life and career Qian was born Qian Beiqiu () in 1895/1896 in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province. He also used the name Qian Chao (). After graduating from Huzhou High School, he entered the National Peking Medical School (now Peking University Health Science Center) in 1914, and worked at a small Beijing hospital as well as his own practice after graduating in 1919. He married a fellow doctor named Zhang Zhenhua. He also taught anatomy in an art academy, and dabbled in filmmaking and radio transmission. The couple helped run a small film company, and Qian wrote and directed the film Invisible Swordsman in 1926, starring his wife and daughter Qian Zhenzhen (later known as Li Lili). In 1925, Qian and his wife secretly joined the Communist Party of China, and used filmmaking and their medical practice as covers for their underground activities. Their best friend Hu Di also joined the party, and the three worked closely together. After the KMT's April 1927 massacre of the Communists in Shanghai, Qian and his wife moved to Kaifeng where they briefly worked for the warlord Feng Yuxiang, before going to Shanghai at the end of 1927. Secret agent Qian Zhuangfei In 1929, the Communist leader Zhou Enlai asked Qian to join a wireless radio training class in Shanghai. The class was run by Xu Enzeng, the head of the KMT's Investigation Department, to recruit special agents for the department. Qian excelled in the class, and gained the trust of Xu, a fellow Huzhou native. Xu made him his \\"confidential secretary\\" and the chief coordinator of the central intelligence headquarters in Nanjing, in charge of recruiting more special agents. This created opportunities for Qian's fellow Communist agents, most notably Hu Di and Li Kenong, to join the KMT secret service as moles. Their intelligence reports helped the Communist Red Army in Jiangxi thwart the first two of Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns. On 24 April 1931, Gu Shunzhang, Zhou Enlai's security chief and head of the Communist Party's dreaded Red Brigade, was arrested in Wuhan while on a mission to assassinate Chiang Kai-shek. To save himself, Gu defected to the KMT, and disclosed his extensive knowledge about Communist organizations. Qian intercepted a telegram sent by the Wuhan police to the Nanjing headquarters, and immediately recognized the severity of the situation. He sent his son-in-law Liu Qifu on an express train to Shanghai to deliver the information to Li Kenong, who in turned informed Zhou Enlai and intelligence chief Chen Geng about Gu's arrest. The top party leaders, including Zhou, Li Weihan, Kang Sheng, and Qu Qiubai, were able to evacuate, but many party members could not be warned in time and were arrested and executed, including 40 high-ranking and 800 ordinary members. It was the largest loss to the Communists since the 1927 massacre. Qian's cover was blown and he escaped just before the order of his arrest arrived. Qian Zhuangfei, together with Chen Geng, Li Kenong, and Hu Di, was transferred to the Jiangxi Soviet Communist base, where Li and Qian controlled the security forces. Qian was also in charge of decoding the telegrams of the encircling KMT forces. Death and legacy In 1934, the Communists were forced to evacuate the Jiangxi base area and begin the Long March. In late March or early April 1935, Qian was killed during the Red Army's crossing of the Wu River in Jinsha County, Guizhou. Zhou Enlai later called Qian Zhuangfei, Li Kenong and Hu Di, \\"the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party\\", and said that he and other Communist leaders owed their lives to them. Li, the sole survivor of the three who lived to see the founding of the People's Republic of China, was awarded the military rank of general (shang jiang) in 1955, despite his lack of combat experience. Family Qian's daughter Li Lili was one of China's most popular movie stars in the 1930s. Qian Zhuangfei's daughter Qian Zhenzhen was born in June 1915. After Qian fled Nanjing for the Communist base, his daughter was adopted by Li Jinhui, the \\"father of Chinese popular music\\", and changed her name to Li Lili. She became one of the most popular movie stars of the 1930s, sometimes called \\"China's Mae West\\". Qian also had two sons, Qian Jiang (Èí±Ê±ü) and Qian Yiping (Èí±‰∏ÄÂπ≥). Qian Jiang was a well-known cinematographer and film director. In 1985, he directed the film Night in Jinling based on Qian Zhuangfei's life.

In April 1590, while he was away on business, she was arrested. Her children wrote to her while she was imprisoned. She wrote to her husband of her innocence, convinced that she would be freed. Lemp was tortured on five occasions and confessed. She wrote again to him, requesting he send her something with which she could end her life. After her letter was intercepted, the court additionally charged her with attempted suicide. The court coerced Lemp into writing another letter to Peter confessing that she was a witch.

Pete Wiltshire, chief revenue officer of Nine Entertainment Co., stated that \\"[9Jumpin] was never designed to be streaming product and it isn't\\" and announced that the purpose- built 9Now service will replace 9Jumpin as Nine's on-demand catch-up TV service with a wider range of content, while also delivering live streaming of Channel 9, 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life. 9Now was described as \\"a premium destination for live streaming, catch-up and on-demand content for all of the Nine Network's linear channels\\". The 9Now website and app were launched on 27 January 2016 along with live streaming for Nine, with live streaming for the multichannels to launch on a later date. However, unlike competitors 7plus, ABC iview, SBS on Demand, and 10play, 9Now requires users to create an account before allowing access to catch-up content and live streaming. Livestreams for 9Go!, 9Gem and 9Life were launched on 17 May 2016. Following the launch of 9Now, Nine's main regional affiliate WIN Television sued Nine Entertainment Co., alleging that the service violated its program supply agreement by broadcasting Nine programming into territories where it held exclusive rights. Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case on 28 April 2016, ruling that Nine had the right to stream its programming nationally because the affiliation agreement's definition of \\"broadcasting\\" did not cover live internet streaming. Nine's victory prompted network executives to revoke WIN's affiliation with the network beyond June 2016, and enter into a new regional affiliation with Southern Cross Austereo (WIN would concurrently switch to Network Ten).

Evans was born at Nantcol in the parish of Llangelynnin, Merioneth, the elder son of Lewis Evans, farmer, who removed in 1856 to Tynllyn, Trawsfynydd, in the same county, by his first wife. The registration of the birth cannot be traced. He was for some years a pupil teacher in the national school at Trawsfynydd and later an assistant in the village store. In 1872 he removed to London, where he remained until his death. Some clerical employment brought him into touch with the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit and Offices Company, Limited, the service of which he entered, becoming first secretary and then managing director. He was attracted to journalism, becoming a member of the parliamentary press gallery, and he continued throughout his life his connexion with the press and particularly with the South Wales Daily News, for the London letter of which he was for many years largely responsible. He was intimate with the younger members of parliament from Wales and welcomed the advent of his neighbour David Lloyd George to London on his election as member for Carnarvon Boroughs in 1890. In 1881 Evans became secretary and editor of the publications of the National Eisteddfod Association and in 1884 a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, the council of which he joined in 1886. He became secretary in 1887, and later undertook the editorship of the society's publications and may be said to have re-established the society. He retained his offices in both these institutions until his death. The strong national feeling which manifested itself in Wales during the last two decades of the nineteenth century looked to the ‚ÄòLondon Welsh‚Äô for guidance, and Evans's interests and associations connected him with many bodies, and in particular with the university colleges at Aberystwyth and Bangor of the university of Wales, of which he was a governor, and which in 1922 conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D. Among other offices he was a governor of the Welsh National Museum and the National Library of Wales; president in 1918 of the Cambrian Archaeological Society; chairman of the executive committee of the Welsh Bibliographical Society; treasurer of the Welsh Folk-Song Society; and he took a large part in organizing and recruiting the London Welsh battalions during the war of 1914‚Äì1918. Although he made no claim to scholarship, many articles of useful comment and careful compilation were published by him in the Cymmrodor and the Transactions of the Cymmrodorion Society. Evans, who was knighted in 1909 for his services to Wales, and appointed Companion of Honour in 1922, was of sturdy build, somewhat above the middle height, with a large and striking head, typical of the people of the uplands of Merioneth. He married in 1881 Annie Elizabeth (died 1898), daughter of Thomas Beale, of Oxford, and had a son, Mr. Lewis Noel Vincent Evans, C.B., deputy director of public prosecutions, and a daughter. Evans died in London 13 November 1934. Evans' public appointments included: *Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and Monmouthshire *Governor of the Welsh National Museum *Governor of the National Library of Wales *President of the Cambrian Archaeological Society (1918) *Vice-chairman of the executive committee of the Welsh Bibliographical Society *Treasurer of the Welsh Folk- Song Society  References  External links * 1851 births 1934 deaths Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Welsh journalists Welsh nationalists ","title":"Evan Vincent Evans"},{"id":"48759397","text":"The 1925 Purdue Boilermakers football team was an American football team that represented Purdue University during the 1925 Big Ten Conference football season.

According to historian Akira Iriye, \\"transnational history may be defined as the study of movements and forces that have cut across national boundaries\\" in a variety of contexts. Originating in American Studies, the term has been applied by historians who seek to avoid taking national history as the \\"natural\\" frame for historical analysis and instead look at the past without the framing of the nation state. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the nationalist movement was on the rise in Europe.Nils Arne S√∏rensen (2009) \\"Den transnationale vending?\\"i Historisk Tidsskrift Volume 109, Issue 2: 459-472. It has some similarities to global or world history. Origins and definitions The idea of \\"transnationalism\\" can be traced back to 1991 when Ian Tyrrell pioneered this approach in the field of American Studies. It was in the late 1990s that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. As the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. There are many competing concepts that emerged in the works of Sebastian Conrad, Kiran Patel, Thomas Adam, Thomas Bender, Daniel T. Rodgers, and Ian Tyrrell. Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the \\"connections and circulations\\" between societies in the modern age.Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier (2009) Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the Annales school.Ian Tyrrell (2008) \\"What is transnational history?\\" Ian Tyrell (blog) Principles The emergence of transnational history resulted from the growing dissatisfaction among some historians with the study of historical phenomena within the limited and limiting space of nation states. The nation state, which was embraced by many nineteenth-century historians because of its progressive and liberal nature, has in the twentieth century turned into an analytical cage and lost much of its explanatory power. Limiting oneself to the space of any given nation led some historians to study only those pieces and parts of a given historical subject matter that existed within the chosen and artificial national space and caused historians to ignore the complex body of the phenomenon that existed outside of this space. According to transnational historians, most historical phenomena existed not just within one national space but grew just like a tree that develops roots and branches, which stretch and extend into the spaces of other countries, empires, and nations. Studying such phenomena within the space of just one nation always meant to study just one branch or limb cut off from its body.Thomas Adam, \\"Transnational History: A Program for Research, Publishing, and Teaching,\\" in: Yearbook of Transnational History vol. 1 (20198): 1-10. Transnational history is based upon the fundamental belief that human activities across the globe are interconnected. Inventions developed in one place, minerals unearthed in another, and plants cultivated in yet another place raced across the globe and influenced the creation of cultures and societies in places far away from their point(s) of origin.Thomas Adam, \\"Transnational History: A Program for Research, Publishing, and Teaching,\\" in: Yearbook of Transnational History vol. 1 (20198): 1-10. Transnational history contributes not only to the de- nationalization and de-territorialization of history, but it also champions a history that is focused on non-state actors. Individuals and non-state agencies are often at the center of transnational history accounts. For example, actors rooted in urban civil society and voluntary associations played a vital part in the most widespread series of revolution in modern European history 1848. Drawing on political ideas circulating in a European wide reading public, the same political ideas and agendas were put to use by activists across European cities in different urban contexts giving urban revolutions across states more similarities than the revolutionary activities in the countryside of the same state. The concept of transurban interconnectivities has therefore been proposed as the most precise concept to capture the nature of the profound interconnectivity between revolutionary movements in 1848. It further insists on the decentering of history, which has all too often been written from a Eurocentric point of view. This Eurocentric view came with the imposition of chronologies and turning points upon countries of Asia that have little meaning to them. Decentering, thus, also means the creation of new and even multiple chronologies.Thomas Adam, \\"Transnational History: A Program for Research, Publishing, and Teaching,\\" in: Yearbook of Transnational History vol. 1 (20198): 1-10.

Its name is derived from the Latin adjective \\"capsulatus\\" (\\"with a chest\\", \\"encapsulated\\"), itself derived Latin noun \\"capsula\\" (meaning \\"a small box or chest\\"), and the associated Latin suffix for masculine nouns, \\"-atus\\" (denoting that something is \\"provided with\\" something else). Its complete genome has been sequenced and is available to the public.  Discovery  The discovery of Rhodobacter capsulatus is attributed to Hans Molisch, a Czech-Austrian botanist. The microorganism, then named Rhodonostoc capsulatum, was identified in 1907 in his book Die Purpurbakterien nach neuen Untersuchungen. C. B. van Niel then characterized the species further in 1944 where it was renamed Rhodopseudomonas capulata. Van Niel initially described 16 strains of R. capsulata that he was able to culture from mud samples collected in California and Cuba. In 1984, the species would be reclassified as Rhodobacter capsulatus with the introduction of the genus Rhodobacter. This genus was introduced to better differentiate Rhodopseudomonas species with distinct morphological differences such as those with vesicular intracytoplasmic membranes (membrane- bound compartments in the cell often involved in photosynthesis) like R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides.  Genomic Characteristics  The R. capusulatus genome consists of one chromosome and one plasmid. Sanger sequencing was first used to assemble the genome. The complete genome was then analyzed using several programs, Critica, Glimmer, RNAmmer, tRNAscan, and ARAGORN. These programs all identify different groups of genes, including protein-coding, tRNA, tmRNA, and rRNA genes. The chromosome is approximately 3.7-Mb with 3,531 open reading frames (ORFs), while the plasmid is smaller at 133-kb and 154 ORFs. Within the 3,531 ORFs in the chromosome, 3,100 had a known function assigned. Another 610 ORFs had similarities to genes that are known, but their function is still not proven. The rest of the ORFs were novel, with nothing similar in UniRef90, NCBI-NR, COG, or KEGG databases used for comparison. The genetic material had a high GC content at 66.6%. R. capsulatus contains all of the genes necessary to produce all 20 amino acids, and also contains 42 transposase genes, and 237 phage genes, including the gene transfer agent (GTA). The chromosome can be found in the NCBI database under CP001312, and the plasmid is under accession number CP001313.  Ecology  These bacteria prefer aqueous environments such as those around natural water sources or in sewage. R. capsulatus has been isolated from the United States and Cuba. Initially, this bacteria could be grown in the lab by plating samples from the environment onto RCVBN (DL-malic acid, ammonium sulfate, biotin, nicotonic acid, trace elements, and some additional compounds) medium and incubating them anaerobically with ample light. Colonies on these plates could then be isolated, grown in pure culture, and identified as R. capsulatus. With the sequencing of its genome, RNA and DNA sequencing can now be used to identify this species.  Morphology and Physiological Characteristics  R. capsulatus is a phototrophic bacterium with some distinctive characteristics. They can grow either as rods or as motile coccobacilli, which is dependent on their environment. At pH levels below 7, the bacterium is spherical and forms chains. When the pH rises above 7, they switch to rod morphology. The length of the rod shaped bacteria is dependent on the pH as well; the cells elongate as the pH rises. In their rod shape, they also often form chains that are bent in nature. The original paper describes them as \\"zigzaggy\\" in shape. In response to the stress put on the cell at a pH of 8 or above, the cells display pleiomorphism, or abnormal, filamentous growth, and they produce a slimy substance for protection. Anaerobic culturing of the organism produces a brown color, on the spectrum of yellow-brown to burgundy. In media containing malonate, the reddish-brown, or burgundy, color is observed. When the organism is grown aerobically, a red color is produced. This species will not grow above 30¬∞C, and it will grow within 6 and 8.5 pH, although specific temperature and pH optima are not explicitly stated in the characterization paper. Although most Rhodobacter species are freshwater and have little salt tolerance, some strains of R. capsulatus appear to tolerate up to 0.3 M NaCl depending on their source of nitrogen.  Metabolism  As a purple non-sulfur bacterium, it is capable of aerobic growth without light, or anaerobic growth with light present, as well as fermentation. This species is also capable of fixing nitrogen. For carbon sources, R. capsulatus can utilize glucose, fructose, alanine, glutamic acid, propionate, glutaric acid, and other organic acids. However, it cannot use mannitol, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, ethanol, sorbitol, mannose, and leucine, which is unique to R. capsulatus when compared to other species in the genus. The most successful enrichments of this species come from proprionate and organic acids. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. capsulatus strain B10 is capable of using acetate as its sole carbon source, but the mechanisms of this have not been identified. The strains studied do not hydrolyze gelatin.  Significance  Rhodobacter capsulatus was the first microorganism observed to produce gene transfer agents. A gene transfer agent (GTA) is a phage-like particle that transfers small amounts of DNA from the producing cell‚Äôs chromosome to aid in horizontal gene transfer. The DNA packaged in the particles is also random; it does not contain all the genes needed for GTA production. While somewhat similar to a transducing particle, GTAs are not created by accident when a phage is packaging DNA into viral particles. The genes for GTAs and their regulation are controlled by the cell itself, not a phage. These particles were first identified when researchers put several different antibiotic resistant strains of R. capsulatus in co- culture and observed doubly-resistant strains. This DNA exchange was still observed even when cell contact was eliminated and DNases were added which allowed them to rule out conjugation and transformation as the cause. A small filterable agent was soon identified as the source of this genetic exchange. When a mutant strain that over-produced these agents was created, it was proven the particles were not being produced by a phage, but by R. capsulatus. After the genes for GTA production were sequenced, more species were found to produce GTAs leading to Rhodobacter capsulatus‚Äôs gene transfer agent being abbreviated to RcGTA. It has been suggested that harsh conditions may trigger the cell to begin producing GTAs which would allow genomic DNA to be shared and increase the overall genetic diversity of the population.

A native of Transylvania, he completed a doctorate at Vienna, and during the 1910s was active in the cultural and religious life of Blaj. Following the creation of Greater Romania, which he enthusiastically supported, he became a civil servant, twice taking part in treaty negotiations. After World War II, the new communist regime suppressed his Greek-Catholic Church and threw P√¢cli»ôanu in prison, where he died. His work, banned under communism but partly re-edited in the years since, focuses on the history of Transylvania between the 17th and 19th centuries, particularly in the religious sphere. Biography Origins, education and early activity Born into a family of Greek-Catholic peasants in Straja, Alba County, in the Transylvania region, he attended the Romanian high school in Blaj. Upon graduating in 1906, he enrolled in the theology faculty of Budapest University, which he completed in 1910. In 1912, he defended a doctoral thesis at the University of Vienna's theology faculty. Written in Latin and titled Relatio Rumenorum e terris coronae S[ancti] Stephani ad Reformationem saec[ulis] XVI et XVII, it dealt with interconfessional relations in Transylvania during the Reformation. It was a pioneering work, both due to the archival investigations the author undertook (and which brought to light valuable documents) as well as to the new historiographical and cultural vision of P√¢cli»ôanu. The thesis had a decisive impact on his view of history, and he continued using his research for this document in subsequent studies. In 1913, he took a study trip to Switzerland, France and Germany. Between 1911 and 1920, P√¢cli»ôanu taught history and theology at the seminary in Blaj,M√¢rza, p. 429-30 and was also the first director of the town's central library, working there from 1916 to 1919. By this time an ordained priest, he served at the Holy Trinity Cathedral. For a time, he directed Unirea newspaper. Writing history at a constant pace for Cultura Cre»ôtinƒÉ magazine from its first numbers in 1911‚Äì1912, P√¢cli»ôanu showed a firm grasp of his material while sharply criticizing both earlier and contemporary historiography. He participated in the province's cultural life, using his oratorical talent to deliver lectures under the aegis of Astra. He also maintained ties to the Romanian Old Kingdom, joining the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians and attending the summer courses taught by Nicolae Iorga at VƒÉlenii de Munte. There, his interactions with other historians helped shape his ideas, and he forged a close friendship with Vasile P√¢rvan.Ghitta, p. 92 In Greater Romania In 1916, the Austro- Hungarian authorities arrested P√¢cli»ôanu on a charge of high treason. They alleged he had spied for Romania, which had recently entered World War I, by offering information to its army. One of twelve Romanian intellectuals arrested in Transylvania, he was freed after five weeks. A committed supporter of the union of Transylvania with Romania, ratified in December 1918 at Alba Iulia, he was present at the occasion as secretary of the Blaj Romanian National Council's executive committee. In 1919, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy,Herban, p. 609 becoming one of several Transylvanians admitted that June.Iancu, p. 67-8 From 1920 to 1922, he headed the Cluj branch of the State Archives. P√¢cli»ôanu then worked as a manager at the Education and Religious Affairs Ministry from 1922 to 1948. He helped draft the 1927 Concordat, and in 1929 led a Romanian delegation to the Vatican on a diplomatic mission. For his efforts in improving church-state relations, Pope Pius XI named P√¢cli»ôanu a monsignor.Bota and Ioni»õoiu, p. 123 World War II activity and communist persecution During the 1930s and '40s, P√¢cli»ôanu held a number of other government posts, heading the Education Ministry's arts office (1930), the minorities section of the prime minister's press bureau (1931), the minorities office at the Education Ministry and then the Religious Affairs and Arts Ministry, leaving in March 1942. For the following two years, he directed the studies and documentaries department of the Propaganda Ministry, also heading a section of the Institute of National History. After a ministerial reorganization in the summer of 1944, he and his department were transferred to the Foreign Ministry. There, he was given the title of cultural adviser within the press, propaganda and information cultural directorate. He also headed the minister's office of studies. A member Romanian delegation to the 1946 Paris Peace Conference, he sat on the political-judicial committee. In this capacity, he served as adviser on Transylvanian history; Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej asked him for information that would bolster Romania's claim over the entirety of the region. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of Academy membership. The same year, the Greek-Catholic Church was outlawed, and after the arrest of Tit Liviu Chinezu and Vasile Aftenie, the papal nuncio named him general metropolitan vicar over the church members in Wallachia, Oltenia and Moldavia. Repeatedly arrested, P√¢cli»ôanu was brutally tortured by the Securitate secret police in the Interior Ministry building and at Jilava prison. He was tried and sentenced for clandestine religious activity. During the trial, where he had no lawyer, he retracted the confessions he had made under duress. One account suggests he was beaten to death as a result of his recantation; another indicates that, weakened by torture, he died at VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison during his second period of detention.

His son, sentenced to death in absentia, managed to flee to the United States, where he became a psychiatrist in Philadelphia. His daughter married a scion of the Wallachian boyar Miclescu family, and the couple settled in France.

Work and legacy P√¢cli»ôanu's research interests included ecclesiastical history, the Romanian national movement in Transylvania during the 18th century and the territorial revisionism of national minorities. His work on Transylvanian history from the 17th to the 19th century is important; he was an expert on the local Romanian church during the Reformation, interconfessional relations, the Romanian church hierarchy and the Enlightenment, and the national awakening of Transylvania's Romanians. P√¢cli»ôanu sought to move beyond confessional partisanship against the Romanian Orthodox Church, instead treating the history of the Greek- Catholic Church with a new methodology.C√¢mpeanu, p. 5 His publications include: Biserica »ôi rom√¢nismul.

Following the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary imposed by the Second Vienna Award, his writings increased in frequency and virulence. He published works in German, Italian and French regarding Hungarian minority policy. Three late articles published in Revista IstoricƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ retain their interest: \\"In jurul ierarhiei Rom√¢nilor ardeleni √Æn secolul XV\\" (1943), \\"Vechile districte rom√¢ne»ôti de peste mun»õi\\" (1943) and \\"Din coresponden»õa doctorului Ioan Ra»õiu\\" (1944). With the onset of the regime, P√¢cli»ôanu's work was banned in its entirety, and appeared only in fragmentary form in exile publications, particularly Catholic ones based at Rome. One of his wartime texts was published in the United States in 1985 as Hungary's Struggle to Annihilate its National Minorities. Based on Secret Hungarian Documents. He left in manuscript form the monumental church history Istoria Bisericii Rom√¢ne Unite, published only in 2006, as well as a lengthy series of studies. Although some historians began to cite his writings in more or less subversive manner after the slight cultural thaw in the early years of the Nicolae Ceau»ôescu era, his work never fully re-entered the academic mainstream. Nevertheless, a systematic attempt to recover his work began after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

In 1974, Amiri Baraka used the term to describe the work of Henry Dumas. D. Scot Miller in 2009 wrote his famous Afrosurreal Manifesto in which he says, \\"Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist...\\" The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in San Francisco, California. The manifesto lists ten tenets that Afro-Surrealism follows including how \\"Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past,\\" and how \\"Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it.\\" Afrosurrealism has a complex genealogy, but its origins can be traced to Black francophone intellectuals and poets from Senegal, Martinique and Guadeloupe. L√©opold S√©dar Senghor referred to an African tradition of the Surreal in 1965. N√©gritude, a pan-African, anti-colonial cultural and literary movement was too grounded in Afro-surrealism. Suzanne and Aim√© C√©saire edited and contributed to Tropiques, a literary publication on Afro-Surrealism in the Caribbean, along with other Martinican poets. Afro-Surrealism, in its origins and its ethos as a movement, is fundamentally global and diasporic. It is practiced and embodied in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include Ted Joans, Bob Kaufman, Krista Franklin, Aim√© C√©saire, Suzanne C√©saire, L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, Ren√© M√©nil, Kool Keith, Terence Nance, Will Alexander, India Sky Davis, Yetunde Olagbaju, Kara Walker, Samuel R. Delany, Starr Finch, Romare Bearden, Christopher Burch.  Influence  The AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009. Until that time, the term \\"Afrosurreal Expressionism\\" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that \\"Afrosurreal\\" without the \\"expressionism\\" would allow further exploration of the term. Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to surrealism in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after Andr√© Breton wrote the Surrealist Manifesto, but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, ‚ÄúEuropean Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.‚Äù. Afro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the Harlem Renaissance, N√©gritude and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003), and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, & Beige: Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009). Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne C√©saire‚Äôs discussion of the ‚Äúrevolutionary impetus of surrealism‚Äù in the 1940s. Though much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aim√© C√©saire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for ‚ÄúThe Marvelous‚Äù over the ‚Äúmiserablism‚Äù expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially Ren√© M√©nil. ‚ÄúThe true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,‚Äù M√©nil says in ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Marvelous,‚Äù[1930s] ‚Äúso that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.‚Äù Suzanne C√©saire‚Äôs proclamation, ‚ÄúBe in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,‚Äù quickly became a credo of the movement; the word ‚Äúmarvelous‚Äù has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions. In his 1956 essay for Pr√©sence Africaine, Haitian novelist Jacques Stephen Alexis wrote: \\"What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?\\" In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not unlike that of traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term \\"Marvelous Realism\\" reflects his influence by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.  Development  The term \\"Afro-Surrealism\\" was coined by Amiri Baraka in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer Henry Dumas. Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. The idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is crucial to Afro-Surrealism. Cinematographer Arthur Jafa expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of \\"the alien familiar,\\" in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. \\"I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you‚Äôve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences.\\"Arthur Jafa, ‚ÄúThe Notion of Treatment: Black Aesthetics and Film, based on an interview with Peter Hassli and additional discussions with Pearl Bowser,‚Äù in Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era, ed. Pearl Bowser et al. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 18. This focus on the alien aspect of Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.  The Future-Past  Miller, D. S. \\"Afrosurreal Manifesto: Black Is the New black‚Äîa 21st-Century Manifesto.\\" Black Camera, vol. 5 no. 1, 2013, pp. 113-117. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/525948. Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is \\"RIGHT NOW.\\" Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.  The everyday lived experience  Much of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience. According to Terri Francis, \\"Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky.\\"  Present day realism  In the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism: \\"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro- Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow‚Äôs-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past.\\" As The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and ‚Äúthe scent‚Äù of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced ‚Äúscent‚Äù of those current manifestations.  Examples of Afrosurrealist Works   Zong!, M. NourbSe Philip and Setaey Adamu Boateng  InPhilip, Marlene Nourbese. Zong! Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2008. Print.Zong!, M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the Zong massacre. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison‚Äôs Beloved, Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip‚Äôs audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.  Beloved, Toni Morrison  As mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison‚ÄôsMorrison, Toni. Beloved: A Novel. New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1987. Print.Beloved remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In Beloved, Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, ‚ÄúSixty Million and more,‚Äù Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.

It was written by Yahlin Chang and Ted Sullivan, and directed by Larry Teng. The episode centers on an earthquake that shakes up National City, causing the Department of Extranormal Operations headquarters to trap a suspicious Alex inside with Hank and the alien fugitive Jemm. Plot In the wake of her recent battle with Red Tornado, Kara's powers are drained. She is told by the Kryptonian artificial intelligence at the Fortress of Solitude that her powers will return in a few days, but she is concerned about her powers never returning. Alex tells Kara that she doesn't trust Hank anymore and urges Kara to enjoy a day without her powers. At work, Kara is sick. Winn offers to do some research on a shortcut to reenergizing her powers, but when Cat arrives at work, she sends Kara home to avoid catching her cold. Kara and James bump into one another, and he tells her that he and Lucy are moving in together. Just as Jimmy tells Kara agree that \\"the world can survive one day without Supergirl,\\" an earthquake knocks them both to the ground. In the ensuing chaos, Kara nearly gets hit by a car before Jimmy pushes her out of the way, inadvertently breaking her arm. On the walk back to work, Kara sees all of the destruction of the city that she could've stopped if she had her powers. At CatCo, the essential personnel still working through the earthquake watch as Maxwell Lord criticizes Supergirl for not saving the city from the aftereffects of the earthquake. When Kara and Jimmy visit Maxwell, he is unfazed and claims that Supergirl has drained her powers and may never get them back. Maxwell attempts to save a woman's father in front of Kara and James, but in the absence of an X-ray machine to find a venous thrombosis, he fails. Without her power of X-ray vision, Kara is unable to save the man as well, making her feel helpless. She is heartened when, dressed as Supergirl with her broken arm still shaking, she is able to talk down a robber. James captures a photo of their confrontation. James shows Kara the picture he took of her and the two share a moment. Winn, who has just found a way to kickstart Kara's powers, walks in on them hugging. He awkwardly mentions that an adrenaline rush will help reignite Kara's powers before leaving upset. An earthquake-triggered gas leak results in a fire on the upper floors of the CatCo building. While climbing up the elevator shaft to help their trapped neighbors, Jimmy loses his grip and ends up clinging to the thinning elevator cables. Just as he falls down the shaft, Kara suddenly appears in her Supergirl uniform, flying down to rescue him before traveling across the city to save the day. Back at the Department of Extranormal Operations, a psychic alien known as Jemm plans to escape. The earthquake also causes damage at the DEO, causing a power outage and an opportunity for Jemm to escape his cell. Hank and Alex seek out the Kryptonian artificial intelligence for advice and gather a team to go after Jemm with neural inhibitors. Hank asks Alex to stay behind with the rest of the team. Alex watches on the monitors as Hank's attempt to take down Jemm fails. Hank returns and warns Alex that Jemm has seen the thoughts of the other DEO officers, giving him the upper hand. Alex, who still believes Hank is hiding something, and another agent follow Hank when he goes to fight Jemm again. Jemm uses his powers on Alex's partner and kills him just as Alex is tackled into a room by Hank. Alex makes Hank handcuff himself to a wall, revealing she knows about his connection to her father's death. Jemm comes looking for Alex, who successfully attacks him. However, Jemm gains the upper hand and prepares to finish her off when he is suddenly attacked by Hank. After a short and brutal fight, Hank snaps Jemm's neck. Hank then turns on the lights and tells Alex that he‚Äôs not the enemy. Confused by his escape and motives, Alex demands answers. He confesses that he is not Hank Henshaw, but rather the alien that Alex's father died saving. He reveals himself as a shapeshifter who copied Henshaw's appearance in order to reform the DEO. He identifies himself as J'onn J'onzz, the last surviving member of the Martian race. He also tells Alex that he promised her father that he would look after her, hence her recruitment into the organization. Later on, Kara invites Winn home, but he declines, saying he‚Äôs never disappointed in Supergirl but disappointed in her. Supergirl speaks with Cat, and, on her way home, is suddenly attacked by three Kryptonians, led by her Aunt Astra. Reception Ratings The episode attracted 856,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 3rd most watched programme on Sky One for the week. Critical response Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted: \\"'Human for a Day' tackles one of the biggest tropes of the superhero genre: a powerless superhero. The point of stories like this is to show that being a superhero doesn't just mean having powers, and the show's exploration of this theme is quite effective. A powerless Kara also allows for characters like James, Cat, and Alex to shine.\\" Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode an 8.6, saying \\"Human for a Day\\" achieves its goal in showing us why Kara is a hero with or without superpowers, while also delivering big on the hype of introducing a new DC superhero to the fold. Jemm is a definite weak link and Winn is still struggling to stay relevant, but Supergirl's latest is a definite winner. Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.3 out of 5 stars.

Storming of Bhurtpoor Plan of Bhurtpore The Siege of Bharatpore was a siege that took place in the Indian princely state of Bharatpur (now part of Rajasthan) between December 1825 and January 1826. British troops under Lord Combermere initially surrounded the state's capital until on 18January 1826 its fortress was stormed and captured. Background Since the Maratha sponsored victory at the Siege of Bharatpur in 1805, Bharatpur had remained beyond British control, a situation that unnerved the Court of Directors of the East India Company (EIC) in London. They met at the beginning of 1825 and sought the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to how Bharatpur could be taken. He recommended Lord Combermere for the task but was told that the Court did not consider Combermere a \\"a man of any great genius\\". \\"I don't care a damn about his genius,\\" Wellington replied, \\"I tell you he's the man to take Bhurtpore.\\" Accordingly, Combermere sailed to Calcutta aboard the EIC ship Thalia and after a prolonged voyage arrived on 2October 1825. Meanwhile, the Maharaja of Bharatpore, Baldeo Singh died in suspicious circumstances to be succeeded by his son Balwant Singh, who was only five years of age but had been officially recognised by the Governor-General of India, Lord Amherst. Before his death Baldeo Singh had entrusted his son to the protection of distinguished General Sir David Ochterlony who, acting on his own initiative as Civil Commissioner, advanced on Bharatpore with an army from the British garrison at Delhi. When Amherst heard of the move, he sent peremptory orders to recall the troops, whereupon Ochterlony resigned. Amherst then appointed Combermere Commander-in-Chief. Siege Combermere's army was made up of two divisions of infantry, one division of regular cavalry, a brigade of irregular horse, a large train of battering ordnance, several brigades of field artillery (horse and foot), along with a corps of engineers, sappers and other requisite troops. The fortress at Bharatpur had been erected by the Jat rulers of Bharatpur and enhanced over the years. By the time Combermere arrived it was in circumference and surrounded by 35 clay and horse dung semi-circular bastions, which had been baked rock-hard by the sun. The fortress was considered impervious to artillery while its defences were enhanced by a wide and deep dry moat, which could be filled by diverting water from a nearby lake. Combermere arrived in Agra on 1December 1825 and reached Bharatpore on the 10th. On arrival, troops were despatched to capture the reservoir to the north west of the fort to prevent the enemy flooding the area as they had done during the 1805 siege. By the middle of December the fort was surrounded by British forces with skirmishes occurring on a daily basis. The siege continued until the night of 18January when two breaches were made and mines exploded so that within two hours the fort had been stormed and taken. Aftermath Following his success at Bharatpur, Lord Combermere was raised in the peerage as Viscount Combermere on 8February 1827. When the prize money was divided following the siege, the officers present gave the sum of ¬£1,000 to the widows of each of the four European officers killed, and ¬£1,000 to be divided amongst the widows and orphans of the European soldiers killed. For many years the 17.75-ton Bhurtpore gun, captured during the siege stood outside the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, London.

TopHat aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes.  History  TopHat was originally developed in 2009 by Cole Trapnell, Lior Pachter and Steven Salzberg at the Mathematics Department, UC Berkeley and the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Maryland, College Park. Trapnell later moved to Genome Sciences Department at the University of Washington. TopHat is a collaborative effort between Cole Trapnell at the University of Washington and Daehwan Kim and Steven Salzberg in the Center for Computational Biology at Johns Hopkins University who together in 2013 also came up with TopHat2 which does accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions.  Uses  TopHat is used to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment. It is a read-mapping algorithm and it aligns the reads to a reference genome. It is useful because it does not need to rely on known splice sites. TopHat can be used with the Tuxedo pipeline, and is frequently used with Bowtie.  Advantages/Disadvantages   Advantages  When TopHat first came out, it was faster than previous systems. It mapped more than 2.2 million reads per CPU hour. That speed allowed the user to process and entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day, even on a standard desktop computer. Tophat uses Bowtie in the beginning to analyze the reads, but then does more to analyze the reads that span exon-exon junctions. If you are using TopHat for RNA-Seq data, you will get more read aligned against the reference genome. Another advantage for TopHat is that it does not need to rely on known splice sites when aligning reads to a reference genome.  Disadvantages  TopHat is in a low maintenance, low support stage, and contains software bugs that have spawned 3rd party post-processing software to correct. It has been superseded by HISAT2, which is more efficient and accurate and provides the same core functionality (spliced alignment of RNA-Seq reads). Newer protocols are more efficient now, compared to TopHat such as cufflinks, STAR, and limma. This is an example of a pipeline for RNA-seq workflow using STAR and Limma. This particular pipeline is more efficient than one using TopHat.

She was the founder of Christ Holy Church International, an African Independent Church in Nigeria. Early life Agnes Okoh was born in Ndoni in Rivers State, Nigeria in 1905, the only survivor of thirteen children born to Onumba Emordi, a farmer, and Ntonefu, a trader. She received little or no schooling and was illiterate; her parents were not Christian, but she would occasionally attend the Catholic church in Ndoni. After her parents had died, she moved to live with relatives in Asaba City in Delta State, where in 1924 she married James Okoh, a Ghanaian sailor. They had two children, Anyetei and Anyele, and her husband died in 1930. Then her daughter Anyele died in 1938, after which she suffered from severe migraines and depression. After conventional medicine and traditional remedies had failed, she consulted Ma Ozoemena, a prophetess who lived in Enugu, and after days of praying, recovered and ceased having migraines. She moved permanently to Enugu, studied under Ma Ozoemena and discovered she had spiritual gifts. While awaiting a call from God to serve him, she made a living from trading in textiles. Ministry The call came in 1943 when she repeatedly heard a voice in her head saying \\"Matthew Ten\\". After some bewilderment, she discovered that this referred to the biblical instructions of Jesus in Saint Matthew's Gospel, chapter ten, telling his disciples to preach the gospel far and wide. By 1947, with encouragement from Ma Ozoemena, she felt ready to start evangelising, sold her profitable textile business and distributed her money to the poor. She started her public ministry in the marketplace in Onitsha, carrying a bell and a Bible, singing gospel songs, praying and exhorting people to renew their lives in Jesus. Many people came to listen, and some were healed of their ailments. She soon became widely known in Igboland and was invited to visit towns and villages in the surrounding area to evangelise. At each place, she sought the permission of the elders before starting singing, praying, preaching healing and prophesying. Periodically she would return to Onitsha where her mentor, Ma Ozoemena was based. Here she set up a prayer house headquarters in an unfinished building, and trained twelve people, ten men and two women, to join her in her ministry. She sought to set up worship buildings for her converts. Some village elders allowed her to build on what were known as \\"evil forests\\". This was a test for the new religious group because the spirits of the outcasts who were buried on these lands were thought to haunt them. She took up the challenge, prayed and erected church buildings without harm coming to her or her converts. She encouraged the villagers to live in and farm these areas and was known as \\"Odozi Obodo\\" (nation builder) because of her ability to overcome the forces of the evil forests. Her ministry flourished, but in 1965 she prophesied that Nigeria would soon be in turmoil, and during the Civil War (1966‚Äì1970) in eastern Nigeria, closed all the prayer houses and encouraged her converts to move to the more peaceful area of Arondizuogu. The war ended in 1970, things returned to normal, and the Christ Holy Church International, as it was now known, continued to expand. Legacy Throughout her life, Okoh was known for her humility and acts of charity. She has had her enemies and critics and survived an attempt on her life. Some people resented her success as a female evangelist. She retired from the ministry in 1980 and returned to live in her birth town of Ndoni. Here she oversaw the building of a primary school and a nursery school, a maternity unit and a public water supply, and she organised the construction of new roads. She died in 1995 at the age of ninety. Her son predeceased her, but her grandson, Daniel Okoh, is the current overseer of the Christ Holy Church International, which currently employs fifteen hundred pastors, and has nearly two million members.

It aims to be the first global championship for autonomous cars. As of September 2017, the official CEO is 2016‚Äì17 Formula E champion, Lucas Di Grassi. The series tested their technology and race formats at FIA Formula E Championship events during 2016-2018. In 2019 they announced Season Alpha, which would be the first time multiple independent teams would compete against each other. All teams will utilize the same chassis and powertrain, but will have to develop their own real-time computing algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies. Car Robocar A show car of the Robocar on display at the 2017 Berlin ePrix. One of the Nvidia Roborace cars in Munich The world's first purpose-built autonomous racing car, Robocar, was designed by Daniel Simon, who previously worked on vehicles for movies such as Tron: Legacy and Oblivion, as well as designing the livery for the 2011 HRT Formula One car. Michelin is the official tyre supplier, and the internal computing processors (Drive PX 2) are Nvidia. The chassis itself is shaped like a teardrop, improving aerodynamic efficiency. The car weighs around 1350 kg and is long and wide. It has four electric motors, each with a power of 135 kW producing over 500 hp combined, and utilizes a 840V battery. For navigation, it relies on a mixture of optical systems, radars, lidars and ultrasonic sensors. The vehicle has been demonstrated at speeds of almost . DevBot Another Robocar on display at the 2017 New York City ePrix Development of the Robocar started in early 2016, with a first outing of a test vehicle, the so- called DevBot, following in the summer of the same year. The test car consisted of the same internal units (battery, motor, electronics) used in the Robocar, but were placed in the chassis of a Ginetta LMP3 car without an engine cover in order to provide better cooling and access. DevBot saw its first public outing at the Formula E pre-season tests in Donington Park in August 2016. After battery issues in Hong Kong caused the development team to abandon their demonstration run, the DevBot successfully drove twelve laps around the Moulay El Hassan Formula E circuit in Marrakesh. Other test tracks included Michelin's testing ground in Ladoux and the Silverstone Stowe Circuit. During testing ahead of the 2017 Buenos Aires ePrix, two DevBot cars raced against each other autonomously, resulting in one of the vehicles crashing on a corner. During the 2017‚Äì18 Formula E season, Roborace pitched pro-drifter Ryan Tuerck against a DevBot at the Rome ePrix.https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/14/roborace-self-driving-car-versus- human/ At the Berlin ePrix, Roborace held the Human + Machine Challenge, the first race for combined teams of human drivers and AIs using a pair of Devbots.  DevBot 2.0  DevBot 2.0 (racing as Technical University of Munich) competing in Season Alpha An upgraded version of DevBot was announced in late 2018, and after private testing made its public debut in 2019 at the inaugural Season Alpha event. DevBot 2.0 uses the same technology as both Robocar and DevBot, with the main changes being a conversion to being driven on the rear axle only, a lower position for the driver for safety reasons and a bespoke composite bodywork. Seasons Testing 2016‚Äì17 Formula E season Roborace appeared at a number of Formula E events during the 2016‚Äì17 Formula E season. However, in this period only test drives with two different DevBots took place. Within the framework of the 2017 Buenos Aires ePrix both DevBot vehicles drove against each other on a race track for the first time. There were also DevBot demonstrations at the 2016 Marrakesh ePrix, 2017 Berlin ePrix, 2017 New York City ePrix and 2017 Montreal ePrix. At the 2017 Paris ePrix, the developers also let a Robocar onto the track for the first time, even though the vehicle only drove the track at walking speed. 2017‚Äì18 Formula E season At the start of the 2017/18 Formula E season, the Roborace developers once again tested the DevBot during a public time trial between the Roborace CI and the TV presenter Nicki Shields at the 2017 Hong Kong ePrix. As part of a similar time trial at the 2018 Rome ePrix, drift professional Ryan Tuerck also tested the DevBot. The Human + Machine Challenge was created for the Formula E race on the Berlin ePrix. A team of doctoral students from the Technical University Munich (TUM) and the University of Pisa programmed the software for the Devbot to drive autonomously around the circuit in Berlin. Afterwards both teams in combination with a human driver competed in a public time trial. The vehicle of the team of the Technical University Munich finished the Human + Machine Challenge with an average lap time of 91.59 seconds, almost four seconds faster than that of the University Pisa with 95.36 seconds and thus won the Challenge. At the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Robocar became the first ever fully autonomous race car to complete the Goodwood Hill Climb. The vehicle completed the first official autonomous run on 13 July 2018 within the framework of the event. Season Alpha (2019) Season Alpha took place at various locations in Europe and North America with the aim of testing several competition formats using the new DevBot 2.0. The first event was held at the Circuito Monteblanco in Spain, and featured the first race between two fully autonomous cars. The events were not broadcast live, instead short clips on YouTube were released. Two teams were competing: Arrival and Technical University of Munich. On 7 July 2019, the Roborace DevBot 2.0 car set the first ever autonomous official timed run at Goodwood Festival of Speed, with a time of 66.96 s and a top speed of . This is currently the record for autonomous vehicles. Roborace also set the Guinness World Record for having the fastest autonomous car in the world. The Robocar reached a speed of . Season Beta (2020‚Äì21) The second testing season is planned to take place at various locations between September 2020 and May 2021, featuring 12 races and involving mixed reality elements dubbed \\"Roborace Metaverse\\".

It was built in 1921. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Miriam Vale War Memorial was erected in 1921 to commemorate the local men who had given their lives in the World War I. Funds were raised by public subscription and it was designed and erected by the Brisbane firm of AL Petrie & Son at a cost of , including the iron fence. Although described in Petrie's account book as a no.8 design, the pedestal was not used for any other of the firm's many soldier-type war monuments throughout Queensland. AL Petrie & Son of Toowong in Brisbane was responsible for more of Queensland's numerous digger monuments than any other masonry firm. They offered a variety of digger monument types and prices, with the Miriam Vale memorial being in the middle of the range. The memorial was unveiled on 14 December 1921 by John William Fletcher, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Port Curtis. An inscription for those who died on active service in the Second World War was added later. The surrounding timber fence is of more recent origin.  Description  The Miriam Vale War Memorial is located at the southeastern end of a long, narrow, grassed and treed park reserve which runs parallel to the railway line to the east and Bloomfield Street, the principal street in the town of Miriam Vale, to the west. The memorial faces the morning light and the Miriam Vale railway station to the northeast, and provides a principal focus at the southern end of the business sector of town, which has retained an early-to-mid 20th century streetscape. The memorial comprises a life-sized stone statue of an Australian Infantry soldier standing with head bowed and arms reversed, on a substantial and ornate sandstone pedestal resting on a granite plinth. The pedestal is capped by a gabled cornice with a moulded wreath in the front gable. On all faces of the pedestal are marble plates, the front plate bearing a leaded inscription and the names of 13 \\"brave boys of this district who gave their all in the cause of freedom 1914‚Äì1919\\". The inscription ends with the words common to British war cemeteries throughout the world: \\"Their names liveth for evermore\\". The southeast plate bears a matching inscription for the Second World War and the names of 8 local men who died in the conflict. The words Miriam Vale Roll of Honour are cast on the front face of the concrete base of the pedestal. The monument rests on a rock- faced granite plinth and is surrounded by its original concrete kerb and iron stake fence, with a gate at the southwest corner. The memorial enclosure in turn is defined by a two-rail timber fence with wrought-iron gates at the western corner. A flagstaff is located at the northern corner of the memorial enclosure, just inside the timber fence, and the memorial is framed by the Big Fig tree to the south, just outside the timber fence but within the larger park reserve. From photographic evidence, this tree and other figs along Bloomfield Street and the cross-street leading to the railway, appear to date to the first decade of the 20th century.  Heritage listing  Miriam Vale War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Miriam Vale War Memorial is significant historically as one of a group of structures erected by public subscription and intended to endure, which illustrate the conscious expression of emerging Australian nationhood, and which reflect early 20th century public fashion and social attitudes. Importantly, the memorial provides an historical record of local participation and sacrifice in two world wars. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Whilst one of a group of similar monuments, the type of pedestal on the Miriam Vale War Memorial is uncommon, the only one so far identified in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Miriam Vale War Memorial is significant historically as one of a group of structures erected by public subscription and intended to endure, which illustrate the conscious expression of emerging Australian nationhood, and which reflect early 20th century public fashion and social attitudes. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Aesthetically, the memorial is significant as a major landmark in the small town of Miriam Vale, and makes a strong contribution to the Bloomfield Street streetscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The memorial also has an important association with the work of stonemasons AL Petrie & Son, who did much to shape the nature of First World War memorials erected in Queensland, in particular popularising the digger monument type, which appears to be more prevalent in Queensland than in other Australian states.

In a system under which political advancement was generally achieved only slowly and the men who reached the higher levels of government generally did so after decades of patient progression, Lamberz was unusual because of the speed of his promotion. Despite having spent three years during the 1940s attending an Adolf Hitler Leadership School, during 1967 he became a member of the important Central Committee of the ruling party, aged around 38, and after only four years on the candidate list. During the 1970s he was sometimes seen as a possible successor to his political ally, the country's leader Erich Honecker. Werner Lamberz was killed in a helicopter accident in Libya shortly after take-off, following a meeting in a large desert encampment with the Libyan head of government, Muammar Gaddafi. The cause of the accident in which Lamberz and his three fellow travelers lost their lives has been a subject for media speculation ever since it happened. Life Early life and Nazi years Werner Lamberz was born in Mayen in the Eifel region, approximately 36 kim (22 miles) to the west of Koblenz. His father, Peter Lamberz, was a building worker and local leader (\\"Politleiter\\") in the (since 1933 illegal) Communist Party. The son became a member of the German Youth organisation, a junior version of the Hitler Youth movement, between 1939 and 1943. One of his contemporaries in the Mayen youth group was the future actor, Mario Adorf, who got to know the family well, being particularly keen on Werner's sister, Liane. Werner Lamberz switched to the Hitler Youth in 1943, In 1941 he was removed from the local school in Mayen and sent away to boarding school at the Ordensburg Sonthofen, an elite special school for those identified as future leaders of Nazi Germany. His mother had been urged both by local party officials and by her own respectable relatives locally to go along with this step in order protect her children, Werner and Liane, from being influenced by his father, the known communist \\"public enemy\\" (\\"Volksfeinde\\"), Peter Lamberz. Peter Lamberz had been one of the first citizens of Mayen to find himself in \\"Protective custody\\" (\\"Schutzhaft\\") when the Nazis had come to power early in 1933, but had been released, subject to ongoing surveillance. Mario Adorf encountered Peter Lamberz on his first visit to the two bedroom apartment where the family lived in Mayen's Koblenzer Stra√üe and later recalled, \\"The father looked in a bad way. He was pale and coughing. One knew he had been in the [concentration] camp, but you were not allowed to talk about it\\".\\"Der Vater sah schlecht aus. Er war bla√ü und hustete. Man wu√üte, da√ü er im Lager war, aber man durfte nicht dar√ºber reden.Der Spiegel 22/1976\\" Werner Lamberz attended the elite boarding school at Sonthofen till 1944. Soviet occupation zone and German Democratic Republic The final months of the war found him helping to keep his father hidden in the Mayen area, also undertaking some work for a nursery garden and for a building company. War ended in defeat for Germany, formally in May 1945, shortly after Werner Lamberz celebrated his sixteenth birthday. Germany was divided by her wartime enemies into military occupation zones. Mayen would end up under French military control. Werner Lamberz undertook an apprenticeship as a heating engineer and installer in the Mayen area. At the beginning of 1946 his mother died and he moved to join his father, who had himself relocated to Luckenwalde, in the Soviet occupation zone as soon as the war ended, In Luckenwalde Lamberz continued to work as a heating engineer. In 1947, now aged 18, he joined the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend/ FDJ), which was becoming the national youth movement of the Soviet administered part of Germany. Despite the deep mutual hatred between proponents of the Nazism with which he had grown up in Germany and of the Communism advocated by the Soviet occupier, the education that Werner Lamberz had received in a school for future Nazi leaders evidently provided appropriate training for a leadership role within the ostensibly Communist FDJ organisation. In 1947 Lamberz also joined the newly created Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands/ SED) which would become the ruling party of a second German one-party dictatorship after the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched, formally in October 1949, as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Werner Lamberz achieved a series of rapid promotions within the local party hierarchy till 1949, when he took on equivalent responsibilities in respect of the occupied state of Brandenburg. Party organisation in Brandenburg remained the focus of his employment till 1952. Between January and July 1950 he attended a study course at the regional party academy at Schmerwitz, after which he was employed as an assistant at the academy till March 1951. Further political education came with a period from August 1952 till August 1953 at the Komsomol (Young Communist League) Academy in Moscow. During the 1950s he held a succession of senior positions in the permanent staff of the FDJ. Between 1953 and 1963 he was successively a member and party secretary for its central council, then its Agitation and Propaganda (\\"Agitprop\\") Secretary, and then its Culture Secretary. Between 1955 and 1959 he also served as the FDJ's permanent representative from East Germany to the Central Council of the Budapest based World Federation of Democratic Youth, with which he would retain links throughout his subsequent career. A significant aspect of Werner Lamberz's long career as an official with the FDJ was the close relationship it enabled him to form and sustain with the organisation's founder and constant supporter, the country's future leader, Erich Honecker, who himself headed up the FDJ's central council till 1955. Lamberz was listed as one of twelve membership candidates for the powerful Party Central Committee in January 1963, and in 1967, still not yet 40, he became one of its 131 members. Between 1963 and 1966 he served under Albert Norden on the Central Committee's Agitation and Propaganda Commission, with special responsibility for Foreign propaganda. It was sometimes claimed that Lamberz was able to speak more than twelve languages, and his fluency in Russian and French is particularly well attested. 1967 was the year in which he became the Central Committee's Agitation Secretary, which effectively placed him immediately in the ranks of the body's \\"top management\\". Additionally in 1967, the year of his admission to the Central Committee, a seat was found for Werner Lamberz in the \\"Volkskammer\\" (\\"People's Chamber\\"), officially the national legislature of the German Democratic Republic. He was also, in 1967, a member of the Electoral Commission which supervised the country's singular electoral processes. A number of the evidently \\"staged\\" photographs of the East German leader Erich Honecker in the 1970s feature Werner Lamberz, sitting or (as here ) standing one or two rows, close behind the leader. This picture, taken on the occasion of a high profile state visit by Fidel Castro, shows the Cuban and East German leaders studying a map of Cuba while Friedrich Ebert and Werner Lamberz look on supportively. Because there is a wall behind the people it has even been possible, here, to top off the entire composition with a portrait of Lenin. He became a candidate for Politburo membership in 1970 and a Politburo member just eight months later, in 1971, the appointment being announced at the Eighth Party Conference in June 1971. The 1971 Party Conference was significant for another reason: Walter Ulbricht had finally been persuaded out of most of his offices a couple of months earlier and, with the encouragement of General Secretary Brezhnev, June 1971 marked the dawn of the Honecker era. It was no coincidence that Werner Lamberz was drawn into the Politburo in the slipstream of the newly elevated Party Secretary. It appears to have been Werner Lamberz, applying his skills as a propagandist and backed with powerful support from the Soviet Union, who choreographed the fall of Walter Ulbricht in 1971, and Ulbricht, for one, knew it. Because he was the leader of the Central Committee's Agitprop department, the responsibilities of Werner Lamberz included keeping the domestic press in line. The nation's news editors were required to attend weekly \\"Discussion Debates\\" (\\"Argumentationssitzungen\\") at the party headquarters. Sometimes the precise wording of headlines and the formulation of texts was provided at these meeting. Lamberz was a \\"hands-on\\" propaganda chief, prone to telephoning editors individually late at night to give final instructions or to berate one of them savagely in respect of a minor oversight. If a television show failed to include a required camera shot, it was not unknown for the programme producer to find one of his cameras had been re-allocated to another studio. The Agitprop job also included handling the foreign news media, and here a contrasting approach was noticed, both in respect of domestic news providers, and when the easy social skills of Werner Lamberz were compared with those of other East German politicians. The West German diplomat-journalist G√ºnter Gaus recalled the persuasive volubility of the Central Committee Secretary at social functions, cocktail glass in hand, switching back and forth between French and Russian. Western journalists, who sometimes felt themselves excluded from sources of information, could find an unexpected ally in the Agitprop Secretary. In 1976, at the opening ceremony for the People's Palace in Berlin, the party opinion former told one stunned newsman from the west that he only had to telephone (\\"einfach anrufen\\"), if \\"one of those Foreign Ministry bureaucrats failed to come up with the goods\\" (\\"...den B√ºrokraten im Au√üenministerium etwas nicht klappt\\"). With Werner Lamberz in charge of \\"agitation and propaganda\\", an East German \\"media elite\\" grew up which in some ways resembled developments in western Europe and North America more closely than anything to be found in other central European countries sponsored from Moscow. However, in the East German system developed under Lamberz the dependence of the media elite on the political elite was more overt than it generally became in the west. Attractive movie actresses and television presenters could be sure that sooner or later they would catch the eye of the media-savvy young Agitprop Secretary. The parties held by Lamberz presented a style and polish not normally associated with the social lives, in public, of senior members of the East German government. Although Lamberz evidently enjoyed the opportunities to socialize with attractive women, he was nevertheless clear that these functions also served the important political purpose of providing support for the regime from a flattered and contented media class. Death in Libya During the 1970s governments from various parts of Europe sought to cultivate relations with the leadership in Libya: both German states participated with enthusiasm. For East Germany, Libya offered an attractive market for the country's heavy industrial and armaments sectors, along with the possibility of investment of Libyan petro-dollars at a time when the country was desperately short of convertible currency. The Libyan leader at the time feared a military attack from Egypt and was particularly concerned over the potential military imbalance between Libya, with a population of slightly more than 2 million people, and Egypt, then with a population of around 40 million. East Germany's military and manufacturing expertise and support were attractive to Libya, as was the chance to develop a political relationship with a still trusted ally of the Soviet Union. Negotiations with such a potentially important trading and investment partner would under most circumstances have been handled by Hermann Axen, the senior Politburo member who was the architect of East German foreign policy during then 1960s and 1970s, but Axen was Jewish which made him an inappropriate negotiator to represent a government hoping to make progress with Muammar al-Gaddafi. Secret negotiations were instead headed up, from the East German side, by Erich Honecker's trusted lieutenant, Werner Lamberz. Early in March 1978, the final meeting between Lamberz and Gaddafi took place in a large tented encampment set up by the latter in the Libyan desert. Matters discussed included finalisation of major trade credits and exports deals negotiated substantively during Lamberz's previous visit, three months earlier. Additionally there was discussion concerning the proposed secret provision of Libyan credit to finance high-tech exports by East Germany to third countries. However, Lamberz died on the evening of their last encounter, and these aspects were not all implemented. At 21.30 on 6 March 1978, shortly after taking off en route back from the tented encampment at Wadi Suf al-Jin (WƒÅdƒ´ Sawfajjƒ´n), the Super Frelon helicopter carrying Lamberz and three other members of the East German delegation fell into a tailspin and crashed. None of the four survived. Those who died along with Werner Lamberz were the Central Committee International Relations chief, Paul Markowski, the translator Armin Ernst and the news-photographer Hans-Joachim Spremberg, the man who took the photograph of Lamberz with Frank Beyer appearing at the top of this piece (2015). It was later reported that Lamberz's Libyan negotiating partners had urged him to stay an extra night and not to risk traveling in a helicopter with a Libyan pilot who was known to have no experience of night flying. The formal agreement between the two countries on the training of military personnel came into effect only twelve months later. The leadership in Libya did not permit any external investigation of what happened, but according to the Libyan accident report the helicopter reached an altitude of about 30 meters, and then attempted to move off to the left, but instead fell like a stone to the ground and exploded. The official Libyan report imputed all the blame for the accident to the pilot. Subsequent conspiracy theories have circled the events ever since, but none of these has progressed beyond a series of tantalising conjectural scenarios. Bodies of the German victims of the accident were subjected to autopsies at the Charit√© (university hospital) in Berlin. The corpses should have included that of Werner Lamberz, but one of the pathologists involved, Wolfgang Keil, stated in a later interview that it had not been possible to find the remains of Lamberz. Nevertheless, Werner Lamberz received a state funeral and an urn believed to contain his ashes following cremation was placed beside the remains of other privileged East German politicians in the cemetery at Berlin-Lichtenberg.

It was built . It is also known as Glassford Creek Copper Smelters. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 July 2006.  History  The Glassford Creek copper lode was discovered in 1893. Initially it was mined for silver then in 1896 for gold and subsequently for copper. The two most important lodes on the Glassford field were the Blue Bag Mine in the north and the Lady Inez Mine in the south. Practically all production on the field came from these two lodes with the Blue Bag Mine the major producer. In 1897, a ten-head battery was erected at Glassford Creek. This led to a total of of ore being mined for a return of of gold. When copper sulphides soured, the amalgamating tables crushing was discontinued and prospecting reverted to copper. An 1897 plan suggests that the gold battery was located within the vicinity of the later copper smelters. In 1900, the Boompa Copper Company made plans to erect reverberatory smelters. When the reverberatory furnaces were completed in 1903 it appears that smelting commenced and continued through to 1908. Water-jacket furnaces were built but do not appear to have been completed until 1906. The mined ore was put through a rock-breaker and over shaker tables where it was handpicked prior to going to the smelter. The Boompa Copper Company went into liquidation in 1908, and in 1915 the water-jacket smelter was dismantled. Residues in the bases of the furnaces were leased out with of copper matte being recovered. The amount of matte recovered in this salvage operation indicates that the methods implemented by the company were inefficient and that the smelters were either ineffectively managed or poorly constructed. The salvage of the matte resulted in a yield of 11 cwt of copper, of gold and of silver. This salvage operation was carried out in conjunction with similar work at the Mount Hector smelter, which suggests that the Glassford Creek and Mount Hector mines had a common leaseholder at this time. Originally the Blue Bag Mine operated as an open- cut, however when operations became dangerous as the removal of overburden increased the depth of the open-cut, shafts and tunnels were excavated from the base of the open-cut to afford access to the ore. The available demographic figures show that the movement of people in and out of the Glassford area was closely aligned to the success and otherwise of the mines. For example, at the beginning of 1907 Glassford had a population of 346 but by the end of that year numbers immediately prior to the Boompa Copper Company going into liquidation had declined to 40. In 1916 Hunting and Clark took over the Blue Bag Mine and a new shaft was sunk. From the of ore sent for treatment they received a return of of copper valued at , of gold valued at and of silver valued at . At the end of 1916 the mine was sold to a southern syndicate for floating. At this time it appears that there were approximately of ore in the dumps located within close proximity of the smelters. When WA Doyle made application in 1918 for assistance to re-establish the copper smelters Government Geologist Ball undertook investigations, the result being that there was insufficient ore to warrant a re-establishment of the smelters. However, further mining was undertaken at the Blue Bag Mine and at the Lady Inez Mine after 1920 with the mined ore being shipped to Chillagoe for treatment. Plans were made to install a new plant and powerhouse but these plans did not eventuate and mining ceased in 1921. Following this the Department of Mines took over the machinery. By 1941, all the buildings in the village of Glassford had been removed, the mining plant dismantled and most of it shipped elsewhere with only the remnants of the water-jacket furnace remaining on site. At the Miriam Vale and Monto community workshops conducted in the 1990s as part of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment for the South East Queensland bio-geographic region's Regional Forest Agreement, Glassford Creek Smelter Sites were considered to satisfy the threshold indicators for National Estate social value.  Description  The Glassford mines, the Blue Bag and the Lady Inez and smelters are accessed via a track leading to Glassford Creek from the Monto-Many Peaks Road. The smelters are located approximately along the track from the last farmstead. Beyond the last farming property, the road is a four-wheel drive track that crosses Glassford Creek several times. The smelter 1 site has a standing chimney with a height of approximately . The smelter area is very overgrown with vegetation covering the collapsed remains of the smelter's brickwork. Little can be interpreted, though it does appear that this is the site of the reverberatory furnaces. Adjacent to the smelter and the chimney is a series of at least 6 pits. It is possible that there could be more pits but the area is covered by galvanised iron from the roof of the collapsed work's building. The six pits that are visible are in two rows of three, each of the pits is two metres in width, with their lengths increasing from to . Adjacent to the pits are the remains of standing and collapsed posts and roof trusses of a building. A three hopper feed bin that may be the remains of a spitzkasten classifer is located near the chimney. A small slagheap covers an area . Approximately to the southwest is a flat area accessed by a road that runs south towards the Lady Inez Mine and northwest towards Smelter 2 and the Blue Bag Mine. This flat area could be an ore sorting/storage floor. The Smelter 2 site has a standing chimney connected by the stone base of a short horizontal flue to a standing brick smelter-support structure, which presumably supported a water-jacket furnace. This structure is long by wide and tall. It is partitioned into two sections, with a sloping internal floor inclined down to two access holes in the front face at ground level. Part of the front wall of the structure has collapsed. A series of engine footings are located near the smelter, and a large boiler with tall chimney attached has fallen off one of these engine beds. The associated slagheap extends over an area , and consists of pavement-like slag poured into formwork, as evidenced on other water-jacket smelter sites. The slag formwork at the edge of the slagheap is old railway rails. Behind the smelter and the engine sites is a stone retaining wall up to high. Above this wall is a flat area that appears to have been an ore sorting or treatment floor. To the east of the smelter area is a long tip of mullock, and to the east of that again is a large area of mullock and ore dump that has been cut through in several places. The cutting was shown in the 1941 plan of the site. A track noted in 1941 as a tramway leads off to the Blue Bag Mine in an easterly direction. There are several areas with mullock around them on the hill slope above Smelter 2 that may be filled-in shafts.  Heritage listing  Glassford Creek Smelter Sites was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 July 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The remains of the Glassford Creek smelter reflect a typical pattern for small copper fields in Queensland, with initial prospecting followed by more substantial but short-lived company development, tailing off into small-scale mining often recovering values ignored by earlier miners. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Glassford Creek Smelters Sites are well preserved for their age and type, and provide uncommon and endangered evidence of this scale of a copper mining enterprise. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Glassford Creek Smelters Sites have the potential to provide information that will further existing knowledge of the nature of mining technology utilised during this period of Queensland's mining history. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Glassford Creek Smelter Sites are considered by the regional community to be a significant part of the history of European settlement in the Boyne Valley. The Smelter Sites are valued as an historical asset not only for the connection that they provide with the past but also for their educational and interpretational values.

They are known for songs such as \\"40 Miles,\\" which became a minor hit in Bakersfield. They began with a basic garage approach but later expanded their creative palette to incorporate esoteric and baroque elements on the 1967 album, Another Day, Another Lifetime. They continued for a few more years but disbanded in the early 1970s. History The band was founded in Los Angeles in 1965 as the Reasons. NOTE: AllMusic mentions the Los Angeles area as their place of origin, but later recounts that \\"40 Miles\\" became a hit in Bakersfield, which is about 100 miles south of LA, perhaps too far out to be considered part of the L.A. metro area. Greg Shaw's liner notes in Pebbles, Vol. 9 mention Bakersfield as their place of origin. (Greg Shaw was incorrect - Originated in Los Angeles (Brentwood) CA. The likelihood is that Bakersfield is the specific place of origin, based on the information gleaned from these two accounts, but that they were active in the L.A. environs. Sources indicate that, very early on, they were playing shows in the L.A. area. AIP CD 5026 - liner notes to CD The band's membership consisted of Warren Hansen on lead vocals and organ, who was also the band's principal songwriter, as well as Mark Bird on lead guitar, Mike Butte on rhythm guitar, Chuck Spieth on bass, Tim Harrison on drums. The group often play gigs in the Los Angeles area and their manager, Steven Vail, succeeded in getting the band signed to 20th Century Fox's record label. They recorded two 7-inch singles for 20th Century Fox. The first of these was recorded in the fall of 1966 and released in early 1967. It featured the song, \\"40 Miles,\\" which became a hit in Bakersfield California, reaching # 19 on the local charts, and was backed with the B-side \\"Bus Token.\\" They followed up with another 45, \\"People Saying, People Seeing,\\" which came out in April. Shortly thereafter, Mike Butte departed from the group, and 20th Century Fox released them from their contract. The band was able to secure arrangements with VMC Records (Vance Music Company) and became the first act to sign with the label. They went into the studio to record a full-length album, Another Day, Another Lifetime, which included baroque orchestration arranged by Gene Page on some of its tracks and saw the band further explore eclectic and esoteric influences in a fashion not dissimilar to the Left Banke, but retaining the harder rocking garage-based edge of their previous work. Warren Hanson wrote all of the songs on the album during the sessions and invented an instrument called the \\"plasmatar,\\" which sounds similar to an electric cello and can be heard on some of tracks. The album featured songs such as the chant-like theme \\"Another Day, Another Time,\\" \\"Sweet December,\\" \\"Now to You,\\" \\"So Much More,\\" and \\"Time M.\\" In 1968 the band played at the Miss Teen Screen Magazine pageant held at the Hollywood Palladium and in the local TV documentary Gramophone to Groovy. Shortly thereafter they released a back-to-basics single \\"I'm Not Alone\\" b/w \\"Sweet December\\" on VMC Records. The band would continue for a few more years but broke up in the early 1970s. Bassist Chuck Spieth, died in a house fire at the age of 21. Band leader Warren Hansen went on to become an engineer engaged in environmental issues. Former drummer Tim Harrison is a property manager in Venice, California, and Mark Bird, former lead guitarist, is a physician in Orange County, California. In the intervening years their work has come to the attention of garage rock and psychedelic collectors and enthusiasts. Two of their songs \\"40 Miles\\" and \\"I'm Not Alone\\" were re-issued in 1996 on the Pebbles, Volume 9: Southern California 2 CD, put out by Greg Shaw's AIP label. In 2001, Jamie Records re-issued their 1967 album, Another Day Another Lifetime.

It is an erect shrub with sticky, aromatic leaves and pink, blue or purple flowers. It is a rarely seen shrub, apparently short-lived, mostly occurring in open, disturbed areas. Description Eremophila adenotricha is an erect, compact shrub sometimes growing to a height of with leaves and stems sticky due to the presence of a dense covering of glandular hairs. The leaves are highly aromatic and are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide and linear with a blunt end. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 pointed, green sepals which are similar in size to each other, covered in glandular hairs on the outer surface and are about long. The petals are about long and joined at their lower end to form a bell-shaped tube. The tube is a shade of purple or mauve with purple spots inside the tube and the petal lobes are blunt. Flowering occurs in spring to early summer and is followed by fruit which are oval shaped and hairy near the top end. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by George Bentham in 1870 as Pholidia adenotricha but in 1882, Ferdinand von Mueller changed the name to Eremophila adenotricha. The specific epithet (adenotricha) is from the Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒ¥ŒÆŒΩ (ad·∏ón) meaning \\"gland\\" and Œ∏œÅŒØŒæ (thr√≠x) meaning \\"hair\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila is only known from 3 locations in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region. It appears to prefer disturbed areas with clay soils and to have a short life cycle. Conservation status Eremophila adenotricha is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Use in horticulture Glandular- haired eremophila is a fast growing but relatively short-lived plant with unusual foliage and deep purple flowers. It can be grown from cuttings or grafted onto Myoporum and grows best in full sun, tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and is frost and drought hardy. Its compact habit obviates the need for pruning but its sticky foliage suggests it should not be grown in dusty places.

He began developing the E Ink display during nights and weekends at the MIT Media Lab in 1995, at the age of 19, after MIT professor Joseph Jacobson challenged him to create a technology that would mimic the appearance of ink on paper. Comiskey ultimately conceived of the microencapsulated electrophoretic display, which overcame the many practical challenges faced by previous attempts at realizing workable particle-based displays. In 1997, after years of research and experimentation, Comiskey and fellow MIT undergraduate JD Albert realized a working prototype. Over the next decade, Comiskey worked on the further development and industrialization of the technology at MIT and subsequently at E Ink, in both Cambridge, Massachusetts and Shanghai, China.

It is one of the oldest shopping areas in the city. Compared to the other shopping spots in the city, the prices here are lower and really affordable. History Broadway was the only shopping street in Ernakulam during early 20th century. Initially the shopping street was located at Mattancherry. When the British took over Cochin from the Dutch, the market moved out of Mattancherry to Kochi, which had everything from a safety pin to clothes and hardware on offer. Broadway had set of coveted tailors right from the start of 20th century. Prominent among those were J. Newfield and Company, which made the best three-piece suits at the time, Koya Hassan and the Bharatha Tailoring Company, which was famous for the uniforms it made for the State chauffeurs. The White Hall Silk Palace, set up in the 1920s by a Muslim trader from Palakkad, was a textile hotspot. Valavi and Company is a shop which started in 1899 on broadway street. They did business in paper, tyres and liquour imported from Europe. About the Name The road leading to broadway was one of the first macadam roads in Ernakulam and this is being quoted as the reason why it got its name 'Broadway'. Shopping Street A street of Christmas star shops Broadway Shopping street covers an area of two kilometer radius road which is sandwiched between Marine Drive, Kochi and MG Road. The area is characterized by narrow roads, quite ironically given its name. The market canal passes through Broadway and Market Road. The shopping street is a car- free pedestrian zone. Broadway adjoins Ernakulam Market where there are many wholesale shops as well. Shops At Broadway, one can find almost everything - ranging from old copper pots (ready to smelt) to latest fashion in clothing and jewellery, books, perfumes, spices..One can even find one of the best furniture shops in town run by a Cochin Jew.Broadway has many roadside shops selling electronic goods, leather items, stationery, watches, jewelry and umbrellas. The Spice market of Kochi at Broadway street is a wholesale market where one can buy good quality spices and condiments. Footfalls There are around 1,000 shops functioning in the two-km radius of Broadway. It is estimated that the market sees a footfall of minimum 5,000 people on holidays but the numbers would touch 20,000 on working days. In 2016, sales at the Broadway market averaged 5 crore per month as per Broadway Shop Owners Association. Peak Shopping Seasons The peak shopping season at Broadway Kochi is during festivals of Vishu, Onam and Christmas. Broadway Renovation Project In 2009, Centre for Heritage Environment and Development and the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project, had submitted a Rs. 30-crore- project for the conservation efforts of the Broadway.Though the project was submitted in the first phase of JNNURM, it failed to take off due to cost escalation and flaws in the DPR. In 2013, a revised detailed project report (DPR) was submitted for funding under the JNNURM transition funding period.

Early life Alhaji\\"Alhaji\\" (m) or \\"Hajiya\\" (f) is a title given to a Muslim who has made a Hajj, a journey to the Holy City of Mecca that Muslims perform as a religious duty. Garba Shu‚Äôaibu Gashua, who is popularly known as \\"Garba Gashuwa\\", is a contemporary Nigerian Hausa poet, businessman, politician and a retired civil servant, born in Gasamu,About 237 kilometers from Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, Nigeria in present-day Jakusko Local Government Area of Yobe State, North-Eastern Nigeria in 1957, to his father SƒÅlisu and mother SalƒÅmatu. Gashuwa‚Äôs father was a native of Badawa (Bade) and had four children, namely Sa‚Äôidu, Isa, Garba (the third), and Musa.Musa ∆äanbade, Garba's youngest sibling, is a well-known oral singer in Hausaland. Today, Garba Gashuwa resides in Kano with his family and has many children; among them is Musa Garba Gashuwa, a talented and popular composer. Education In conformity with the general practice among Muslims communities in Hausaland, Gashuwa‚Äôs education started at the age of two when he attended a traditional Qur'anic school in Gasamu. On graduating he moved to Gashuwa, where he studied hadith, fiqh and other subjects related to Islamic knowledge. Gashuwa did not enroll in any formal Western school,Birniwa (1987:502) but learnt from friends how to read and write in the Roman script. Gashuwa is also a polyglot. Career Business After completing his studies, the young Gashuwa, started a business in Bade town selling Islamic books such as Qawa‚Äôidi, Yasin Arashada, Iza-waqa, Ahalari and Dala‚Äôilul Khairati.Gashuwa (2008:4) Apart from being a book vendor, he was also at one time a shoe vendor and a mai dinkin hula (a Hausa traditional cap-stitcher). He lived in Lagos for many years in pursuit of these entrepreneurial ventures. Civil service Gashuwa‚Äôs civil service career began when he eventually relocated and settled in Kano at the request of the late Malam Aminu Kano. His first appointment by the Kano State Government was at CTV-67's Cultural Section, during the administration of Alhaji Aliyu Sabo Bakin Zuwo,.Gashuwa (2008:4-7) He worked there until 1989, when the State's military administrator Colonel Idris Garba, requested his transfer to the Kano State History and Culture Bureau, where he served as an adviser. He worked at the Bureau until he rose to the position of a member of its Board of Directors, a position he held from 1989 to 1995. He retired from service in 1995 and devoted his life to composing Hausa poems in Ajami script.Gashuwa (2008:6) Poetry Gashuwa was inspired by Abdu Nguru, a poet of his acquaintance, and later started on Islamic subjects such as Isra‚Äôi & Mi‚Äôiraj, and the miracles and death (wafaat) of the Prophet Muhammad. His works are normally penned in the Hausa Ajami script. He started writing political poems during the 1978 campaign tour of National President of the People's Redemption Party, Malam Aminu Kano, held in Gashua and its environs. As a result, Aminu Kano invited Garba Gashuwa to reside in Kano, for him to continue making his contribution to political developments of the time.Gashuwa (2008:5) Whenever Gashuwa chanted his political poems, his audiences would chant the chorus, clapping their hands.Birniwa (1987:502) Besides religion and politics, Gashuwa wrote on other subjects and, so far, has more than 1,000 Hausa Ajami poems to his name. Themes, language and style of Gashuwa‚Äôs poems Initially, Hausa poets used (and still use) the sixteen Arabic metres adopted from Arabic prosody in their composition. Today, some poets choose styles and themes that are modern, although the influence of Arabic poetry is still visible. Gashuwa bases most of his poetry on the rhythms of legendary Hausa singer and musician, Dr. Mamman Shata of Katsina, with themes including religion, politics, social issues, education, and traditional culture. In the use of language and poetic devices, \\"the language of his poems is simple and apt to be understood by the average Hausa\\".Birniwa (1987:518-519) He also make use of Arabic and English loanwords, dialect, proverbs and innuendo to express his points. Above all, Gashuwa always opens and closes his poem with a doxology, no matter the motif. Sometimes his poems are to be accompanied by hand clapping. For Gashuwa \\"an effective political poem should be chanted in a pleasant voice, accompanied by hand clapping, and should contain proverbs\\"; he holds that this will surely attract an audience‚Äôs attention.Birniwa (1987:503) Below is an example of proverb in his poem named ∆äan Hakin da ka Raina, \\"The Little Grass That You Despise\\". This poem is in ∆ôwar biyar, pentastich form, with ‚Äúb·æ±‚Äù as the external rhyme. This stanza echoes a proverb in Hausa which states: ::: ::::\\"God curse your brother for demeaning himself\\", as the bush camel (giraffe) said, when it saw the domestic camel heavily loaded.Birniwa, (1987:506-510) Garba Gashuwa has published Fasahar Garba Gashuwa, \\"The Poems of Garba Gashuwa\\" (a transliteration from Ajami to Boko script), an Anthology, which includes a collection of 30 out of his many poems, edited by Professor Abdul∆ôadir ∆äangambo of Bayero University, Kano (2008), and published in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. Reception of his work There is a bachelors dissertation (in Hausa language) on his contributions to Hausa literature, written in 1990 by Amina Tijjani of Bayero University. There is a whole chapter in Abdullahi Birniwa‚Äôs doctoral thesis, 1987, Usman Danfodio University, Sokoto, Nigeria, which analyses ∆äan Hakin da ka Raina, cited above. Another doctoral thesis by Jibril Shu'aibu Adamu of University of Warsaw, Poland, uses his poems as part of materials being studied. Selected poems ∆äan Hakin da ka Raina‚Ä¶ (The little grass that you despise‚Ä¶) Aminu Nuruz Zam·æ±ni (Eulogy to Malam Aminu Kano)According to Birniwa (1987:503), this particular poem influenced the public to a greater extent than any other of his poems.

Born in Manchester, Douthwaite left school at the age of eleven, working first for a tea merchant, then for the Bradford Dyers Association. He moved to Romiley, then in Cheshire, where he joined the Hatherlow Mutual Improvement Society, then the Independent Labour Party (ILP).David Howell, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XII, pp.72-76 Douthwaite soon became secretary of the ILP's branch in Romiley, and by the late 1900s was active at the national level. He supported Victor Grayson at the 1907 Colne Valley by-election and, like Grayson, launched attacks on the ILP leadership. He proposed that the ILP disaffiliated from the Labour Party, but this motion was heavily defeated at the 1909 ILP Conference; his proposal that the ILP should back independent socialist candidates was defeated much more narrowly. He was elected to the ILP's National Administrative Committee (NAC) in 1910, defeating W. Williams to represent Cheshire and North Wales, then later in the year contributed along with J. M. McLachlan, Leonard Hall and J. H. Belcher to the Green Manifesto. This was condemned by the majority on the NAC, and Douthwaite lost his seat on it at the next election, in 1911. However, that year he was elected to Bredbury and Romiley Urban District Council (UDC), winning on the drawing of lots, as he had tied with a Conservative candidate. In 1912, Douthwaite attended the Socialist Unity conference organised by the Social Democratic Federation. This formed the British Socialist Party (BSP), and Douthwaite joined the new party. He was immediately elected to its Standing Order Committee, alongside Duncan Carmichael, Peter Petroff and E. C. Fairchild, and the four worked together to ensure voices in the party opposing British rearmament were heard. The BSP affiliated to the Labour Party, and Douthwaite devoted much of his time to it, being re-elected to the council in its colours in 1914, soon leaving the BSP. Douthwaite focused on local politics during and after World War I, chairing the UDC and the Macclesfield Divisional Labour Party. He stood unsuccessfully for Stockport at the 1935 general election, but was elected to Cheshire County Council in 1937. He finally lost his seat on the UDC in 1947, but served on the county council until his death in 1949.

It covers the southern third of the Irafsky District of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. The park was created to have a dual purpose of serving as an ecological refuge - it has very high levels of biodiversity and vulnerable species, such as the near- endangered west Caucasian tur ‚Äì and also an area of high cultural heritage and potential for recreational tourism. The park contains widespread archaeological ruins from several notable past civilizations, including the Bronze Age Koban people (1200‚Äì300 BCE), and the Alans people (100 BCE ‚Äì 1234 AD). It is from the Alans that the name \\"Alaniya\\", and indirectly the term \\"Aryan\\", is ultimately derived. Because altitudes in the park can span almost 4,000 meters vertical in very short distances, the slopes and valleys display strong 'altitude zoning'. These climatic zones range from alpine glaciers and peaks in the high, southern sections, to steppe grasslands in the northern reaches. Topography Altitude zones (bare rock and scree on peaks, forest on middle slopes, and grassland in valleys. Alania NP, Irafsky District The park sits at a central point of the Caucusus, which are themselves the continental divide between Asia and Europe. Alaniya NP is approximately two- thirds of the distance between the Black Sea to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. The southern border of the park, at the top of the mountain ridge, runs along the border with the Republic of Georgia. To the west is the Kabardino-Balkaria Reserve (another mountain-peak protected area), and to the east is the North Ossetian Reserve. Altitudes range from a high at Mount Uilpata of , to 800 meters in the Urukh River valley below. Most of the ground cover is glacier, rock and scree at the higher altitudes. Modern glaciation is approximately . At mid-level altitudes, approximately 20% of the park is forested. At the lowest levels, and in the valleys to the north, are grasslands and scattered forest. The park has more than 70 rivers and streams, mostly fed by glaciers. The few lakes are small in size and also fed by glaciers and snow runoff. The 45 lakes cover an area of only 11 hectares in total, while the 5 alpine marshes cover a total area of 103 hectares. The main ridge and side ridge is composed of granites, gneisses, and schists, with the younger sedimentary rocks gathered in large fan-shaped folds. There are mineral springs in the upper valleys, waterfalls, and forest glades on terraces. Named glaciers include the Masota, Tana, Karuaugom, Songuti, Bart, Fastagstete, and Tasmazov. The primary river valley through the park is the Urukh River, fed by the Karaugom Glacier and numerous glacial tributaries. The Karaugom Glacier is 1.3 km long, and 26.6 km in area. In elevation, the glacier reaches from 3,440 meters at the top to 1,830 meters at the bottom of the tongue ‚Äì a height of . A recent study associated the glacier's with a rise in temperatures in the Central Caucusus of 0.05 degrees C per year, and an average glacial retreat of 8 meters per year. Moreover, the Karaugom descends to a lower altitude than any other glacier in the Caucusus, well into the forested zone. Karaugom Glacier, distant view from north up the Urukh River.

At mid-level altitudes, approximately 20% of the park is forested, with pine, rhododendron, yellow birch, juniper and wild rose being common. At the lowest levels, and in the valleys to the north, are grasslands and river plain plant communities. Over 1,000 species of plants have been identified in the park, 200 of which are endemic to the Caucasus. At the uppers level of the Haresskogouschelya river valley, at the 2,400 meter level, is the \\"Chifandzar Swamp\\". This peatland is approximately 3 hectares in size, dominated by sphagnum, sedge and northern flowers such as the golden buttercup. With a depth of 3 meters, it is believed that the Chifandzar is 5,000 years old.

History Archaeological ruins, Village of Galiat in the protected cultural zone on the northeast border of NP Alaniya The area of Alaniya NP has been inhabited for thousands of years. Because it features fertile territory on an important trade route through the Caucuses, it has been a home for many succeeding groups who have left archaeological remains of their presence. The Bronze Age Koban culture inhabited the area from about 1100 BC through 400 BC, when they are believed to have been destroyed by the Scythians. The Koban people established workshops of skilled metal-workers, taking advantage of the mineral resources of the mountainous area. The Koban also developed terrace agriculture, beginning a tradition of soil erosion in the area that eventually left large patches of the terrace land infertile. In the early years of the first millennium the area was settled by the Alans people. The Alans, a warlike, nomadic tribe who spoke an Iranian language, had been nomadic throughout Europe before eventually settling in the Northern Causasus around 700 CE. They built a powerful kingdom in the Alaniya area. When they were militarily overcome by the Mongols in about 1300 CE, they retreated in to the hills, remaining relatively isolated until 500 years later. These Alans were the medieval ancestors of the current Ossetian people. The present day people in the western areas of North Ossetia (known historically as Digoria) sometimes speak the Digor dialect; they were one of the last groups brought officially into Ossetia. The mountainous area of Irafsky District has experienced long-term population decline and out-migration for the past 200 years. As to the park itself, the present administrative unit was preceded by a protected forestry reserve established in 1958. In the years following and through the creation of full national park status in 1998, the assembly of linked protection zones was created. Today, the park is protected by the Department of Forestry and Protection, with full-time patrols by car, horse and foot to enforce environmental laws. Tourism For all types of visitors to the recreational zones, permits are issued in the city of Chikola, with allowances for cars and pets. To venture into the security zone on the border, permits must be obtained from one the frontier offices (see the park's website for details); a 1- to 30-day turnaround time may be necessary. Transportation to the park is typically by train or plane to Vladikavkaz, then by bus or taxi to Chikola. There are hostels in Dzinaga and Rostelmash, and a hotel at the \\"gates of heaven\\" location in the park. There are also accommodations at the climbing camp \\"Coma-Art\\"; contact directly for information. The park is well known for mountain climbing. Climbs from the simple to 6B in the Russian classification; the two highest peaks are Uilpata (4649 m) and Laboda (4313.7 m).

Design and construction Last in a line of successful 4-4-0 locomotives designed in Florence, the Class 552 was basically an evolution of the earlier Class 545 and Class 550 locomotives, with a larger boiler and bigger cylinders.

However, they were the swan song of the two-wheeled express locomotives in Italy, as their relatively modest performance, at , quickly became insufficient; with the introduction of more powerful locomotives with three driving wheels (such as the Class 630 or the Class 670), the Class 552 was soon relegated to secondary roles. However, unlike its predecessors (all disappeared by the 1930s), some locomotives of the class managed to survive until 1946, working around Treviso.

Most of the members in this family were the Peshwas (prime ministers) in the Peshwa Era of the Maratha Empire, and Peshwa later became their family name. During their regime, most of the Indian subcontinent was under their control. The last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British East India Company in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818.

After the Kuomintang (KMT) began its suppression of the Communists in 1927, Hu worked as a mole in the Kuomintang secret service, together with Qian Zhuangfei and Li Kenong. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai called them \\"the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party.\\" Hu was executed in September 1935 by the renegade Communist commander Zhang Guotao during the Long March. Life and career Hu was born Hu Baichang () in 1905 in Shucheng County, Anhui Province. He also used the names Hu Beifeng () and Hu Ma (). In 1923, he was admitted to China University in Beijing, where he befriended Qian Zhuangfei and his wife Zhang Wenhua. In 1925, the three secretly joined the Communist Party of China, and they worked closely together. They established the Guanghua Film Company, using filmmaking as a cover for their underground activities. After the KMT's April 1927 massacre of the Communists in Shanghai, and the execution of Communist leader Li Dazhao in Beijing, the three moved to Shanghai, where Hu found work at the Shanghai Film Company. He met the experienced Communist underground worker Li Kenong and introduced him to Qian. Hu Di In 1929, Qian successfully infiltrated the KMT's secret service and was appointed the chief coordinator of the central intelligence headquarters in Nanjing, in charge of recruiting more special agents. This created opportunities for Hu Di and Li Kenong to join the KMT secret service as moles. Hu was made the chief of the KMT's Tianjin secret service unit, disguised as the Great Wall News Agency, while Li ran the Shanghai unit, ostensibly the Broadcast News Service. Their intelligence reports helped the Red Army in the Jiangxi Soviet thwart the first two of Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns. On 24 April 1931, Gu Shunzhang, Zhou Enlai's security chief and head of the Communist Party's dreaded Red Brigade, was arrested in Wuhan while on a mission to assassinate Chiang Kai-shek. To save himself, Gu defected to the KMT, and disclosed his extensive knowledge about Communist organizations. Qian Zhuangfei intercepted a telegram sent by the Wuhan police to the Nanjing headquarters, and delivered the message to Li Kenong in Shanghai, who in turned informed Zhou Enlai and telegraphed Hu Di, who immediately boarded a foreign ship and left Tianjin for Shanghai. In August 1931, Hu Di and Qian Zhuangfei left Shanghai for the Jiangxi Soviet, the Communist base area in Jiangxi Province. Death and legacy In 1934, the Communists were forced to evacuate the Jiangxi base area and begin the Long March. In June 1935, the Red Army arrived in Sichuan Province, where the commanders Zhu De and Zhang Guotao disagreed on the direction to continue. Zhu wanted to go north to Yan'an but Zhang ordered his soldiers to head south. Hu Di opposed Zhang's move. In revenge, Zhang labelled Hu a KMT spy and had him executed in September. Zhou Enlai later called Qian Zhuangfei, Li Kenong, and Hu Di \\"the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party,\\" and said that he and other Communist leaders owed their lives to them. Li, the sole survivor of the three who lived to see the founding of the People's Republic of China, was awarded the military rank of general (shang jiang) in 1955, despite having no combat experience.

Modern Sumerian-Mesopotamian religious groups already existed since the 1980s; however, the first institutional form of the movement was founded in Iceland in 2010, and in 2013 Zuism was registered among the religions recognised by the Icelandic government. After the mid-2010s, branches of the church were established in other countries of central and northern Europe. In late 2015 the Zuist Church of Iceland was taken over by a new leadership, under which the church was turned into a medium for a mass protest against the nationally mandated tax on religious membership; Icelanders began converting in large numbers as the new leadership promised that the tax received by the Zuist Church would have been used to refund the church members themselves. After a legal struggle, in 2017 the original directors of the church were restored to power. They decided to maintain the previous leaders' principle of refunding church members, and also to devolve funds to social welfare institutions. Zuism has spread considerably in Iceland by attracting members among younger, internet-connected, less Christian generations of Icelanders. Terminology and definition Modern Sumerian- Mesopotamian religion has been known as \\"Zuism\\", \\"Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopaganism\\" or \\"Sumerian-Mesopotamian Reconstructionism\\", \\"Babylonian Neopaganism\\" or \\"Babylonian Reconstructionism\\", and \\"Kaldanism\\" (which means \\"way of Chaldeans\\", Chaldea being a late term for Sumer). Among them, Zuism has become the most popular descriptor for the movement, by virtue of being the name under which the religion is recognised by Icelandic law. The name \\"Zuism\\" originates from the Sumerian verb zu , meaning \\"to know\\", and is defined as a \\"way of knowledge\\", of knowing the appropriate modality of being human, in harmony with divinity. It is equated with the Greek term gnosis. Zuism is defined as an international religious movement which intends to represent all the groups professing Sumerian-Mesopotamian religions. The Zuist Church of Iceland, the organisation recognised by the Icelandic government, has established branches throughout various countries and intends to be a platform for all Zuist believers. Many Zuists and Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopagans are contributing to the development of the movement both within and outside the Zuist Church. Though seldom used, the term \\"Pagan\\" is accepted within Zuism in the original Latin meaning of pƒÅgƒÅnus, that is to say \\"civilian\\", related to the noun pƒÅgus (\\"region/district/settlement/establishment/kinship\\" of a civilisation), to pƒÅx (\\"peace\\") and the verb pƒÅc≈ç, pƒÅcƒÅre, pƒÅcƒÅvƒ´, pƒÅcƒÅtum (\\"to make peaceful/appease\\"), and to the verb pang≈ç, pangere, pepigƒ´, pƒÅctum (\\"to fasten/fix/set/establish\\"), all coming from the Indo-European root *pak-, *pag- (\\"to be firm/steady/standing\\"). In the Zuist usage, it means human society when it is divinely established in a celestial civilisation. Zuists reject the modern American distortion of the term as meaning any abnormal pseudo-religious movement, anything antisocial, uncivil, without normal civilisation. Beliefs ecliptic pole; An is the whole of the map and the north ecliptic pole itself, within the coil of the constellation Draco (here not represented). ‚Äî The white, red and black (luludanitu) ring just around the centre are the constellations of the \\"Path of Enlil\\", constituting the northern or inner sky, with Enlil himself specifically identified as MULApin (\\"STARPlough\\"), Triangulum, the enclosure in the section \\"I\\". Enlil's female, Ninlil, is the MULMargidda (\\"STARChariot\\"), the Big Dipper or Great Chariot, in the same ring. ‚Äî The green ring are the constellations of the \\"Path of Enki\\", constituting the southern or outer sky, with Enki (\\"Lord of the Squared Earth\\") himself specifically identifies as MULIku (\\"STARField\\"), the Square of Pegasus, the enclosure in the section \\"I\\". ‚Äî The blue ring between the inner Path of Enlil and the outer Path of Enki is the \\"Path of An\\" itself, with starting point in MULDilibat (\\"STARForbearing\\" or \\"STARDaisy\\"), the enclosure in the section \\"I\\", which is Venus‚ÄìInanna, the \\"Spouse of Heaven\\", central one of the seven planetary gods, reflections of the seven stars of the Great Chariot, whose function is to connect the seven to the supreme oneness of An. Zuism is defined as the knowledge on how to appropriately stand in-between Heaven ( An or Dingir) and Earth ( Ki), by acting in accordance with the creative word ( utu) and the measures ( me) represented by the gods ( dingir), all constituting the energetic logos ( lil) of Heaven. The compound Anki (, literally \\"Heaven-Earth\\") defines the ordered world, the cosmos, when the Earth is organised in accordance with Heaven's laws. The lil (\\"wind\\" or \\"breath\\") is the Sumerian concept of logos (\\"word\\" and \\"order\\"), but also pneuma, the substance of all things, especially in its shifting and moving state prior to coalescence into any shape. Theology Gods are held to be immortal beings, who are human-like and yet invisible to human eyes. They are potencies who guide the development of the universe. The four main divine beings are: ‚ë† the universal supreme An/Dingir (literally \\"Heaven\\" or \\"Sky\\", astrally identified as the north ecliptic pole encompassed by the coil of the constellation Draco, and with all the constellations spinning around it; the Little Bear is his chariot, MULMar.gid.da.an.na, the \\"STARChariot of Heaven\\"), which is in turn identified as ‚ë° Ki or Ninhursag (; literally \\"Earth\\" or \\"Lady of the Mountains and Valleys\\"); ‚ë¢ Enlil (; literally \\"Lord of the Breath\\", the god of weather and thunder, identified as MULApin, the \\"STARPlough\\", that is the constellation Triangulum, and generally with the northern sky‚Äîcalled Path of Enlil‚Äî, that is to say the circle nearest to the north ecliptic pole An; his wife Ninlil , literally \\"Lady of the Breath\\", is MULMar.gid.da, the \\"STARChariot\\", the Great Chariot) and ‚ë£ Enki (; literally \\"Lord of the Squared Earth\\", the god of water and craft, astrally identified as MULIku, the \\"STARField\\", that is the Square of Pegasus, and generally with the southern sky‚Äîcalled Path of Enki‚Äî, that is to say the circle farther from the north ecliptic pole An). Sky, earth, air and water are thus considered the fundamental elements of the cosmos. An, Enlil and Enki An is the supreme God of the universe, the supreme being, the utmost power and prime mover of creation, and therefore the utmost ancestor of all beings. It is \\"the one who contains the entire universe\\". He is the father of all the star-gods and contains them all. His most visible manifestation from the Earth's perspective is the north ecliptic pole winded by the constellation Draco (the Dragon, symbol of primordial protean undeterminacy and therefore infinite potentiality). An, Enlil and Enki constitute a threefold conception of the supreme God, in which Enlil and Enki are two aspects of An, the absolute in its quiescent state of \\"transcendental obscurity\\"; they are, respectively, the \\"transcendent\\" and \\"immanent\\" aspects of An. An is therefore \\"transcendental\\" in the sense (acquired by this term in German idealism) of both transcendent and immanent, is \\"transcendently active as the energy begetting any immanent being\\", manifesting as the dynamism of Enlil and Enki. In Assyrian iterations of the theology, according to the scholar Simo Parpola, it is Ashur () or Anshar (), meaning \\"Whole Heaven\\", \\"God as Many\\", \\"Flowing One\\" or \\"One Flash\\"), to be the transcendent supreme, while An is the first stage of manifestation in the flesh; according to the Enuma Elish, Ashur \\"reflects itself\\" as An in matter. While Enlil is identified as the north celestial pole (that is to say the culmen of the Earth's axis of rotation, and the culmen of the sky from the Earth's perspective, which moves in circle through the constellations around the north ecliptic pole), associated to the seven stars of the Great Chariot, and as the lil itself, thus the logos and pneuma of the universe enlivening all things, Enki is the supreme power manifest in the Earth, in earthly beings, and in mankind as well through the struggle to emulate Heaven by learning its craft, and therefore represents the incarnation of the supreme God in matter (the concrete action of the north pole[s] in shaping matter), and in mankind's ancestors, founders of blood kinships, of lineages of power-craft. Enki is associated with semen (and the phallus), the life-giving male power. The three aspects of Heaven are also identified with three concentric rings of the vault of the sky around the centre of the ecliptic pole, and with the star-gods (constellations) moving within these rings, drawing the scheme of time (the calendar). The three aspects of Heaven, and their three skies, are also associated to a colour symbolism. The inner sky of An as Enlil is conceived as red, white and black, representing the threefoldness withheld in potence in the transcendent supreme God. These three colours are together known as luludanitu and represent the threefoldness of God withheld in potence. The middle sky is lapislazuli-blue, the colour of Inanna, and the outer sky of An as Enki is jasper-green. The divine word that orders chaos In Zuist theology, the supreme God of Heaven is also the power of the performative word ( utu, which is also the name of the sun in Sumerian). The word-power of An, Anutu (also rendered \\"Anship\\"), is the \\"foundation of the cosmos, around which the hierarchy of all divine powers unfolds\\". It is the creative word which begets things and events, not necessarily ex nihilo, but in an ordering process which configures reality, making order out of still undeterminacy (Abzu/Nammu /, the \\"Abyss\\" of the primordial \\"Matrix\\" or \\"Noise\\", called Tiamat or Tamtum in the Akkadian tradition). The word-power of An, reflecting its twofold face (Enlil‚ÄìEnki), may also take the form of a destructive power or a preservative power, reabsorbing or maintaining creation, respectively the Enlilutu (\\"Enlilship\\", the word-power of Enlil) and the Enkiutu or Eautu (\\"Enkiship\\" or \\"Eaship\\"). The word-power of Enki is particularly associated with magic/witchcraft and technique in tangible reality, that is to say the power to alter the forces at play in an already given configuration of reality. The seven Anunnaki Anunnaki literally means \\"offspring of Heaven‚ÄìEarth\\", and in Sumerian religion it was a general term comprising all the gods. A later, Babylonian term for the gods was Igigi. In the Babylonian sources the two categories are often distinguished, with the former being the netherworld (earthly) gods and the latter the upperworld (heavenly) gods, or vice versa. The most important amongst the Anunnaki are the seven gods of the stars nearest to the earth: Marduk (\\"Sun Calf\\"; Jupiter, the white deity of air and authority, lieutenant of Enlil), Ninurta (\\"Barley Lord\\"; Saturn, the black deity of war and hunting), Nergal (\\"Underworld Lord\\"; Mars, the red deity of woe and dearth), Inanna (\\"Lady of Heaven\\"; Venus, the blue deity of love and war), Nabu (\\"Announcer\\" or \\"Glowing\\"; Mercury, the orange deity of wisdom and writing), Nanna (the Moon, the green deity of fertility and fruitfulness) and Utu (the Sun, the yellow deity of justice). Another important god contemplated by the Zuists is Dumuzi (shepherd god of death and resurrection, astrally identified as Aries). In a description of the late Dorothy Murdock, the seven Anunnaki \\"represent the seven nether spheres, [are the] guardians of the seven gates through which the sun [i.e. word] of God passes into the netherworld\\", perfusing light and order into the netherworld's darkness. The star-gods are also poetically described as the \\"heavenly writing\\", the writing of An. In other words, they influence, energetically shape, the life of beings on Earth. They are stages in the \\"tree of life\\", the process of God's manifestation in the flesh, structuring all beings, as reconstructed by Simo Parpola based on Assyrian sources. The seven planets are also the near-Earth reflection of the seven stars of the Chariot constellations which spin around the north celestial pole, regarded as the active power of the utmost God of Heaven (Enlil). The seven-day week, with each day associated with a star-god, is a heritage going back to Mesopotamian religion. Utu is the \\"judge of the Anunnaki\\", while Marduk is the \\"commander of the Anunnaki\\", while their \\"king\\" is Enlil. Nanna, also called Enzu or Zuen (; literally \\"Lord of Wisdom\\") is of particular importance, being the symbol of the pleroma (the sum of the powers of all the gods, thus of An). Ethics and practice Eagle-headed apkallu (court scholar), from Nimrud, Iraq, 883‚Äì859 BCE. Eagles, as the only animal traditionally considered capable of gazing at the Sun (God), and the eagle- headed men of wisdom ( zu), represent the bright aspect of the human soul capable of ascending to Heaven by following the gods, whereas the snake represents the dark force of descension towards the Earth. The me: divine laws The universe is created by the gods through the word, utu (), and developed through the measures, manners or morals (me ). The divine word (utu), that has performative power, is power to create. By the words of the founders and earliest leaders of Zuism, the \\"act of creation ... was accomplished through utterance of the divine word\\". The deity \\"had merely to make plans and pronounce the name of the thing to be created\\". The measures (me) are \\"universal and unchangeable rules and laws that all beings are obliged to obey\\", which \\"keep the cosmos in continuous and harmonious operation and ... avoid confusion and conflict\\". Entities and behavioural phenomena are generated and kept in harmony among themselves by these internal laws, plans laid down by gods. Yet, within this structure, mankind enjoys a degree of detachment from its own internal laws, and therefore a degree of free will, a gift which is necessary for mankind's spiritual ability to co- work with the gods in creation by emulating Heaven. The gods favour those who act in conformity with the laws of morality, which means upkeeping goodness and truth, righteousness and straightforwardness, justice and freedom, mercy and kindness. Disgrace falls upon those who act evilly and falsely, unjustly and oppressively, sinfully and perversely, cruelly and pitilessly. Scriptural recitation and institutional relationship with the gods Belief and practice of Zuism is based on Sumerian poems, which Zuists recite in their worship services in honour of the gods. Regular gatherings are held for such scripture recitation in honour of the gods, as well as for prayers, which are either personal or for the welfare of others. Believers conduct their daily life according to the me, which in human society are translated as ethical codes modeled after the laws of the universe, and govern every aspect of morality from individual to social economy. Zuism is a \\"social religion\\", meaning that men and gods are considered symbiotic parts of the same complex whole. Gods govern the fate of men, and relationship with them may not be forsaken. Chiefs and priests are responsible for upkeeping the relationship with the gods through daily, monthly and yearly ordinances held at temples. Priests are called en or ensi, and the highest among them is the lugal (, \\"great man\\"). The lugal is of supreme importance in the terrestrial hierarchy of the Zuist Church. He is a religio-political figure, a sacerdotal king who represents the link connecting the three realms of Heaven (An), Earth (Ki) and humanity. He is the reflection of Heaven on Earth, specifically embodying Heaven's third aspect, Enki, representing human craft and productivity in alliance with the creation of the gods; representing humanity co-creating with the gods a celestially-centred kingdom where all the spirits are at peace and from where all evil demons are cast away. The lugal is like the \\"personal god\\" (also referable to as tutelary spirit, genius, numen or demon) of an individual and the father of a family. Like the personal god generating and organising the individual (joining the ishtaru, which is the individual's female aspect, or matter, or \\"personal goddess\\"), and the father generating and organising a family in conjunction with the mother, his wife, so the lugal is the father of the city and its population. Annulment of debt and wealth redistribution According to the Zuist Church, Sumer had the earliest tax system in the history of civilisation for which archeological attestations exist. Sumerians were aware of the threat posed to economies by the accumulation of debt, and for this reason debt was regularly annulled. This practice was called amagi () or amargi (), literally \\"return to the mother\\", which became a figure of speech for \\"freedom\\", implying the restoration of persons and properties to their original status, with the cancellation of debts and obligations. The Zuist Church aims to restore it for today, starting with the redistribution among members of the wealth received through the tax on religious membership which governments‚Äîincluding that of Iceland‚Äîimpose on their citizens. Zuism intends to establish a new social structure, a sort of \\"theocratic socialism\\", with temples ( √©) functioning as economic powerhouses, banks, centres of business and industry, and redistributors of wealth, just as they were in ancient Mesopotamia. The bala (\\"exchange\\") was the taxation system by which the temples collected goods and surplus and conveyed them into welfare and development projects. In ancient Mesopotamia \\"land was considered property of the gods and not of individuals or families, so that this spurred non-rivalrous collaboration for cultivation and settlement\\". =Charity= The members of the Zuist Church of Iceland may choose whether to devolve their paid taxes to charity. In 2017, the Zuist Church devolved funds to a number of social welfare organisations: 1.1 million Icelandic crowns were donated to the Circle Children's Hospital (Barnasp√≠tala Hringsins), 1 million to the Women's Shelter (Kvennaathvarfsins), and 300 thousand Icelandic crowns to the emergency fund of the UNICEF. With the help of its members, according to the leader √Åg√∫st Arnar √Åg√∫stsson, the Zuist Church may become \\"a long-term sponsor of such organisations\\". Temple and burial ground On 16 January 2018, the Zuist Church of Iceland applied for the allocation of a plot of land in Reykjav√≠k for the burial of its members. On 29 May of the same year, the Zuists of Iceland presented the project and applied for the allocation of land for building a temple in the capital, which will be called the Ekur of Enlil (literally \\"Mount-Court of Enlil\\" or \\"Temple-Mount of Enlil\\"). It will function as the headquarters of the Zuist Church and as the main site for religious rituals, including baptisms and weddings. The temple will be on three levels, a ground floor and a first floor dedicated to community activities, and a shrine to the deity on the second floor. The Zuist Church opened a \\"fund for the ziggurat\\" (Zigguratsj√≥√∞) to which members will choose whether to devolve their taxes. Organisations Before the establishment of the Zuist Church in Iceland, there were already some Zuist or Sumerian- Mesopotamian Neopagan groups, mostly small and informal, many of which still exist. The Sumerian-Mesopotamian contemporary new religious movement, indeed, dates back at least to the 1980s. According to the Zuist Church of Iceland, its history may be further traced back well before the 2010s to a \\"mother church\\" of Icelandic believers who dwelt in Delaware, United States. Zuist Church Zuism became a government-recognised religion in Iceland in 2013, when Icelandic law was amended to allow further non-Christian religions to be registered with the state. The incorporated organisation, the Zuist Church (Zuism Tr√∫f√©lag, more precisely translated as \\"Zuism Faith Fellowship\\"), has since established communities in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. The Zuist Church was founded years before, in 2010, by √ìlafur Helgi √ûorgr√≠msson, who left it at an early stage of development. The current head priest of the Zuist Church of Iceland is √Åg√∫st Arnar √Åg√∫stsson, who took on the office in September 2014. In late 2015 the Board of Directors of the Zuist Church of Iceland was hijacked by people who were originally unrelated to the movement. Under the new leader √çsak Andri √ìlafsson, Zuism became a medium for a protest against the major government-supported churches and against the levying of a tax on all taxpayers, payable to their religion if they had registered one; after the protest started over 3,000 members joined in a short period of time at the end of 2015. Iceland requires taxpayers to identify with one of the religions recognised by the state, or with a non- recognised religion or no religion; a tax (of about US$80, ¬£50 in 2015) is paid to the relevant religion, if recognised, but will run directly to the government if a religion is not stated. Zuism, unlike other religions, promises to refund the money it receives from the tax. √Åg√∫st Arnar √Åg√∫stsson and the new board led by √çsak Andri √ìlafsson started a judicial dispute over the leadership of the organisation. √Åg√∫st Arnar √Åg√∫stsson was ultimately reinstated as the leader of the movement, and, by October 2017, after two years of frozen activity, the case was closed allowing the church to dispose of its charges and refund its members. The British branch of the Zuist Church was founded by √Åg√∫st Arnar √Åg√∫stsson, his brother Einar √Åg√∫stsson and Einar's wife, S√≥ley Rut Magn√∫sd√≥ttir, in 2018 but dissolved in 2019. Symbolism The grapheme for An or Dingir. Symbols used by Zuists include the cuneiform grapheme zu ( in the logo of the Zuist Church) and the more important cuneiform grapheme An or Dingir (). The grapheme for An or Dingir represents the \\"Gate of God\\" ( Ka.dingir.ra in Sumerian, Babilu in Akkadian), that is the organisation of the sky centred around the ecliptic north celestial pole, the calendar, the operating heart of space-time, of the supreme God of the universe. In the wake of the Assyriologist Pietro Mander, Zuist researchers explain that the grapheme An or Dingir, which means \\"Heaven\\" but also generic \\"divinity\\", also has the meaning of \\"spike\\", \\"cluster\\", \\"petiole\\" and is also frequently interpreted as meaning \\"star\\", \\"asterism\\", though these, mul in Sumerian, are more precisely represented by doubling () or tripling the An grapheme. On a philosophical level, its most appropriate rendition is \\"centre of irradiation\\" and \\"navel of the world\\" (a concept treated by Mircea Eliade), which emanates the web of the world (personified by the goddess Uttu, \\"Spider\\", the last daughter of Enki), which connects all things; it is the sacred centre shared by all entities. It is well represented by the Sumerian figurative meanings of the spike composed of many spikelets, the bunch of grapes, and the petiole from which the fruit (metaphor of the world) hangs. Zuism and other religions and thought systems Views on Christianity and Sitchinianism According to independent Zuist researchers, Christianity (viewed as corrupted and dying in its modern forms) is a \\"false religion, or non-religion\\", as it \\"fails to relink Heaven, Earth and humanity\\"‚Äîthe word \\"religion\\" is derived from the common root of the Latin verbs religere (careful \\"re-reading\\" or \\"re-collecting\\" right practices) and religare (\\"re- linking\\"), according, respectively, to the etymologies provided by Lucretius' De Rerum Natura and Lactantius' Divinae Institutiones. The Zuist vision of God is presented as a worldly one, in which God is \\"the starry sky and its cycles\\". The God as conceived by Christianity in instead presented as a \\"non- existing, otherworldly abstract thing\\". At the same time, Christianity is characterized as \\"a religion for the slaves, deliberately created to breed and domesticate masses of slaves\\" by postponing \\"its plan of universal equality to an otherworldly future\\", which \\"results in a rejection of the present world, of worldly potentialities, and thus in an alienation of individual intelligences from the present world, and in the fall of the latter into anomy\\". Christianity is also considered to have appropriated the pan-Eurasian concept of the trinity, distorting it by abstracting God, and trying \\"to fix, to stiffen, the creative operation of the universe (the logos, the second and third persons of God in traditional Eurasian theology; Enlil and Enki in Sumerian theology) in a definitive way, as one single spatiotemporal person (Jesus)\\". With the abstraction of God, \\"Heaven\\", no longer identified as God itself or God's manifestation, was transcendentalised and projected as an otherworldly future realm. Zuists also rejects Sitchinianism, defined as another \\"abstract, nonsense science fiction\\", a misinterpretation of ancient knowledge which is a \\"sadly a popular thought paradigm among contemporary masses\\" and \\"just the latest spawn of the Christian abstraction of God and objectification of the logos\\". Views on atheism Zuist Church's literature presents Zuism as a scientific religion, based upon the order of Heaven, An, which is not a transcendent human-like God but \\"the universal cosmos and the nature of things\\". This makes Zuism different from the religions of transcendental theism, and makes it able capable of welcoming theological positions such as pantheism, panentheism and even atheism. Zuism therefore \\"proposes itself as a reconciliation of the dichotomy between scientific atheism and religious theism, consequently emerging as well as a new type of social organisation capable of reconciling religious and secularist positions in the field of politics\\".

Wolstein Abraham Moffat (24 September 1896 ‚Äì 28 March 1975) was a Scottish trade unionist and communist activist. He was elected repeatedly to high office in the trade unions and represented the union on government coal boards. He held major union offices: President of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers; member of the Executive Committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain; Vice-Chairman Scottish Regional Coal Board; and member National Coal Board. He served as president of the union from 1942 to his retirement in 1961, when he was succeeded by his younger brother Alex Moffat, also an activist. Joining the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1922, Abe Moffat was active in a variety of ways. In 1924 he was elected as a communist candidate to the Ballingry Parish Council, serving for 5 years. He was appointed as a full-time official of the United Mineworkers of Scotland, a communist union, becoming its general secretary in 1931. He served until 1935, when the union dissolved. He was also elected to the Central Committee of the CPGB in 1932. Early life Moffat was born in 1896 into a Plymouth Brethren family in Lumphinnans in Fife. His family had a long tradition of involvement in mining trade unionism; his grandfather had been a pioneer of the trade union in the Lothians in the 1860s, but was forced to move to Fife due to victimisation. He left school at the age of fourteen to work at the local coal mine, while spending his spare time competing in middle-distance athletics. He joined the miners' strike of 1912. During World War I he served with the Royal Engineers. He did not become politically active until after the war. Rise to prominence Abe and his brother, Alex Moffat, were central to the miners' struggle for economic rights. Many years later, the Central Fife Times and Advertiser reported that \\"the name Moffat was to become legend throughout the Fife, then Scottish, and ultimately the British mining industry. The Moffat brothers were reported to be in the thick of every struggle to defend and improve the conditions of the miners and their families.\\" Alex and another sibling, David, born seven years apart, were more than just younger brothers to Abe. They were brothers-in-arms, and usually biographies tend to combine them. Being born in Lumphinnans one of several pit towns dominated at the time by the Communist Party and called 'Little Moscow' by some they were almost destined to become mine unionists and communists. Working in the pits for 16 years, Abe Moffat was frequently victimised. He actively supported miners' strike actions. Moffat was prominent in the 1921 lock-out of miners, and afterwards was blacklisted. He turned to busking until he was able to regain work at the pit. Inspired by John Maclean and Bob Stewart, in 1922 he joined the recently founded Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). He helped publish the Buzzer, a newsletter for militant miners at Glencraig Colliery, Lochgelly. In 1924, he was elected for the party to Ballingry Parish Council, holding the seat for five years. Moffat held office in the Mineworkers' Reform Union, which split from the Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan Mineworkers' Association (FCKMU). It was active in the 1926 miners' strike, and Moffat arranged for the parish council to pay local miners during the dispute. This was illegal, and Moffat was fined ¬£172, but he did not pay and the matter was dropped. However, after the strike, the industry owners did not hire him for twelve years. Although Moffat was unemployed for lengthy periods, he was elected as a checkweighman at Lumphinnans Colliery, also known as Peeweep, in 1928. Due to his leadership in a dispute over payment systems, Moffat was appointed as a full-time official of the United Mineworkers of Scotland, a communist union. The union was struggling to survive, and Moffat rose quickly to become its general secretary in 1931, serving until it was dissolved in 1935. He was also elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1932. National Union of Scottish Mineworkers The dissolution of the United Mineworkers left Moffat out of work again, but he was elected to Fife County Council in Valleyfield and Blairhall in 1938. Working a few days at the Brucefield mine made him eligible to become a member of the FCKMU. He became his branch delegate to the executive, then in 1940 was elected to the National Union of Scottish Mineworkers' executive. Two years later, Moffat was elected president of the union, beating Jimmy McKendrick. He used the post to advocate increased output during World War II, and was re-elected in 1944 with a large majority over Hugh Brannan. He held three major union offices: President of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers; member of the Executive Committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain; Vice-Chairman. Scottish Regional Coal Board; member National Coal Board. In 1943, Moffat met King George VI at a reception at the Gleneagles Hotel. Newspaper reports noted that the two discussed production levels in Scottish mines. On 8 October 1947 Moffat testified at the Whitehaven Explosion Inquiry. Moffat was also involved in inquiries into disasters at pits in Knockshinnoch, Kames, Linday and Auchengeich. He was known for his passion and grasp of detail at the inquiries, and as a result was nicknamed the \\"Miners QC\\". When the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was formed in 1945, Moffat was elected to its executive, serving until his retirement.1945 Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory.

They manufactured two vehicles, the Minari Club Sport (otherwise known as the Mk1), and the Minari Road Sport (otherwise known as the Mk2). They specialised in producing the components required to build cars based upon the Alfa Romeo Alfasud and 33 running gear, with bodies mainly constructed from GRP. These could either be purchased in Kit form or through a build agent, Chameleon Cars. Around 130 Mk2 kits were sold before production finally stopped in 2000.  Vehicles  Minari Engineering Ltd. produced two different vehicles during their tenure.  The Mk1 Club Sport  The Mk1 Club Sport was Minari Engineerings first production kit. The chosen donor car was the Alfa Romeo Alfasud, this was primarily chosen due to the large number of Alfasuds being scrapped due to corrosion, but still having well functioning drive trains. Only 13 Mk1 cars were produced, and not all of them were finished or road registered. The Mk1 cars had extremely shallow doors, made so by the deep sills designed to keep the monocoque rigid. The boot aperture opened to the rear of the car, making access challenging for larger items. The bonnet opened forward as one piece, enabling good access to the engine bay. The headlights and windscreen were taken from a Citroen AX, along with a ford transit windscreen seal. The bonnet hinges are from the rear doors of a Land Rover Series III Safari, and the rear lights are from an Alfasud.  The Mk2 Road Sport  Minari RoadSport with John Deer headlights Minari RoadSport with Mazda Headlights The Mk2 Road Sport was an evolution of the Mk1 design. The cars featured the same engine and suspension fitment (donated from an Alfasud or 33), with an improved monocoque structure and updated styling. Whereas the Mk1 Club Sport utilised the Alfasud rear lights, the Mk2 used Mazda 121 (1996-2002) rear lights, and Mazda 323 headlights. There was an option to utilise fibreglass shrouds and install headlights from a John Deer tractor, which some owners opted for. The doors on the Mk2, whilst still shallow compared to most cars, were dropped further into the sill line to enable improved entry and egress to and from the vehicle, particularly when fitted with a roof. The Mk2 cars offered a hardtop option that had not been available on the Mk1's. Whereas the boot on the Mk1 opened towards the rear of the car, the Mk2's opened in a more conventional fashion. As part of the improved monocoque design, an additional bulkhead had been added between the passenger cabin and boot space, meaning that the boot was substantially smaller on the Mk2 cars. The dashboard was also revised, and came in two forms depending upon which donor car was opted for. The Alfasud based cars had a dashboard which came down and around the gear shifter and mated with the transmission tunnel. The Alfa 33 based cars had a more flat and up-to-date looking dashboard design. The Mk2 retained use of the Citroen AX windscreen and Land Rover bonnet hinges, but opted for the door catches from a Fiat Panda. The external door release is embedded into the side body panel to the rear of the door as opposed to the door itself, making new entrants to the car occasionally somewhat confused. Assembly The Minari cars were designed to be self assembly kits completed by the customer and then registered with the DVLA, however after significant demand from customers a third party assembly company called Chameleon Cars was contracted to build turnkey cars. Donor cars were either supplied by the customer or sourced by Chameleon. Later on turk key cars or unfinished projects could be built by a company called Arden Automotive, the build agent for the Murtaya. Evolution As the source of donor Alfa Romeo's was drying up, investigations began into other vehicles that could be used as a donor. The obvious option was the Subaru Impreza as it also sported a flat-4 engine layout. The standard Minari, being front wheel drive, did not have a suitably sized transmission tunnel to accommodate the Subaru gearbox, and thus modifications were required. The project culminated in the production of the Delfino Feroce. The Minari Engineering company eventually folded as the founders moved on to do different things. The tooling, moulds, and production rights of the Mk2 Road Sport were sold to Adrenaline Motorsport Limited who at the time were looking at evolving the work that had been completed on the Delfino Feroce. Having analysed the design of both the Minari Mk2 and the Delfino Feroce, they decided that a significant re-design was in order, and after some significant development effort the Murtaya was born. Ownership The Minari Mk2 Road Sport production rights, tooling, and moulds were sold in 2011 to Paul Featherstone-Harvey of Peninsula Sports Cars. Peninsula continued to offer Minari kits for sale, and also offered spare parts to current owners. Following the death of Paul Featherstone-Harvey in late 2017, the production of the cars and any spare parts is currently on hold. The Minari Mk1 Club Sport moulds were the subject of a legal case the details of which are unknown. The moulds themselves were later donated to a college motorsport engineering department, who after many years of storing the moulds, destroyed and disposed of them.

Taken hostage on 13 December 2012 near the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing when crossing into Syria, Richard Engel and his crew members ‚Äì Aziz Akyava≈ü, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar ‚Äì was detained in the vicinity of Ma'arrat Misrin in northern Idlib. Five days later, the six journalists managed to escape during a firefight at a checkpoint of Islamist Ahrar ash-Sham. The case was controversial, as upon their release, Engel and his crew blamed a Shiite Shabiha group of Assad-loyalists for the abduction. The narrative was however challenged, and it later turned out that they were most likely abducted by Free Syrian Army (FSA)-aligned Syrian rebel group North Idlib Falcons Brigade. It also became known that NBC News' investigation team had suspected the Sunni group from the outset, but withheld their intelligence.  Early coverage  The kidnapping was first revealed to the public, when Turkish journalist C√ºneyt √ñzdemir tweeted about fellow Turkish journalist Aziz Akyava≈ü having disappeared. Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet ran a news report on 16 December 2012 that was picked up by Turkish news channel NTV, Chinese news agency Xinhua, and U.S. blogs Daily Kos and Breitbart, amongst others.  News blackout  NBC News Washington Bureau Following the disclosure, NBC News asked every reporter inquiring about the H√ºrriyet report to participate in a news blackout. They also asked Twitter users to take down related tweets. U.S. online magazine Gawker, amongst others, broke the news blackout referring to the news being already out in the public. Gawker's author John Cook emphasized that ‚Äì unlike in the case of the 2008 kidnapping of New York Times reporter David Rohde ‚Äì the rationale offered in off-the-record conversations didn't \\"indicate a specific, or even general, threat to Engel's safety.\\" Human Rights Watch emergencies director Peter Bouckaert criticized the outlets which ran reports ahead of the captives' release. He defended the news blackout as going ‚Äúagainst the journalistic instinct to report the news, but in many of these cases [do] save lives.‚Äù In contrast, fellow war correspondent Robert Young Pelton criticized the news blackout as a \\"clumsy attempt to cover collective corporate ass and mitigate bad publicity,\\" maintaining that no one could show blackouts help protect captives. Release and early eyewitness accounts Aziz Akyava≈ü, Richard Engel and John Kooistra ' at a news conference in Reyhanlƒ±, Turkey following their escape Following their release on late Monday, 17 December, Engel and his crew returned to Turkey. NBC immediately published a statement informing about them being \\"safely out of the country\\". Associated Press spread an amateur video, that had apparently been posted earlier that week by the hostage-takers on YouTube. While Aziz Akyava≈ü spoke at a news conference in Turkey, Engel, Kooistra and Balkiz had their first appearance on NBC's morning show Today. In his Today interview, Engel said that while crossing back into Syria, they were captured by around 15 men, who \\"literally jumped out of the trees and bushes\\" and dragged them out of their car, killing one of the rebels who accompanied the crew. During their captivity near the village of Ma'arrat Misrin, they remained physically unharmed, but were blindfolded and bound, and were subjected to mock executions. The kidnappers had talked \\"openly about their loyalty to the government\\" of Syrian president Assad, and that they wanted to exchange them for four Iranian agents and two Lebanese member of the Amal Movement. He said he therefore had \\"a very good idea\\" about who his captors were: members of the Shabiha militia, who are loyal to Assad, trained by the Iran's Revolutionary Guard and allied with Lebanon-based Hezbollah group. NBC wrote in a statement that Engel and his crew became free when during a relocation, their vehicle ran into a checkpoint of fundamentalist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham, and that during a firefight, \\"two of the captors were killed, while an unknown number of others escaped.‚Äù The rebels then helped escort the crew to the border with Turkey. Reactions U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, wrote on Twitter that she was relieved for Engel and his crew, adding that: \\"The situation for Syria‚Äôs people remains dire. They, too, deserve to be free.\\" Later interviews In one of the several interviews of team members with NBC News, producer Ghazi Balkiz recounted the firefight that eventually led to their liberation, was for him the most \\"nerve-wracking\\" moment, though being personally subjected to mock executions before. It became clear that the NBC team was initially captured near the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing, and that five days later, they used the \\"chaotic minutes\\" of the firefight to break out of the van and take cover. In the April 2013 edition of Vanity Fair, Engel recounted his experience in an editorial, \\"The Hostage\\". Early doubts While the network and Engel were thought of having followed \\"a consistent clear-cut narrative on the kidnapping,\\" Jamie Dettmer of The Daily Beast challenged NBC's version only days later. The NBC version, he wrote, \\"omits much and is at odds with what security sources involved in the freeing of the group say happened,\\" referring to unnamed sources who also claimed the network was trying to present the incident in the best possible light, masking a series of basic security lapses. Furthermore, according to Dettmer's unnamed sources, NBC‚Äôs security advisers had been convinced that there was at least some involvement of \\"rogue members of the rebel FSA.\\" NBC's security contractor Pilgrims Group had already focussed on the area of Ma'arrat Misrin and urged FSA contacts to set up checkpoints to box the captors in, pointing out that Engel had been supportive of the uprising against Assad. The sources praised the fundamentalist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham for having done \\"a brilliant job\\" during the subsequent firefight. 2015 revision of the course of events Richard Engel receiving the 2015 Peabody Award for NBC's coverage of ISIL. More than two years later, in April 2015, NBC News revised its narrative of the 2012 kidnapping, stating that it was highly likely that Engel and his team were abducted by a Sunni rebel group rather than by pro-regime Shabiha. Engel explained that their abductors had \\"put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite shabiha militiamen\\". He upheld that they were rescued by Ahrar al-Sham, stating that a \\"bearded gunman\\" he referred to as the Islamist group's local commander Abu Ayman, had approached and told them they were safe now. Before, the New York Times had conducted several dozen interviews, suggesting that the NBC team \\"was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army.\\" The suspect group was named as the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, led by Azzo Qassab and Shukri Ajouj, who were said to have a history of smuggling and other crimes. According to current and former employees, NBC executives had already been informed of Ajouj and Qassab‚Äôs possible involvement during the kidnapping. NBC had also received GPS data showing the captives being held in a chicken farm that was widely known by local residents and other rebels as being controlled by the rebel group. Nevertheless, NBC had put Richard Engel on the air with an account blaming Shiite captors.

(aka Boys Anti-Tank Rifle) is a 22-minute 1942 instructional film created during World War II by Walt Disney Productions for the Directorate of Military Training, The Department of National Defence and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Its purpose, akin to ‚Äúedutainment‚Äù, was to instruct Canadian soldiers in the handling and care of the Boys Mk.1 Anti- tank rifle for use in combat against Nazi tanks. The film presented information in an entertaining manner as well as providing an anti-Nazi propaganda message.McCarthy, Sarah J. \\"Filmography: WWII Animated Films.\\" SJMcCarthy.com, July 29, 2012. Retrieved: March 7, 2016. Stop That Tank! is organized into two separate sections: the first animated section lasting three minutes, 15 seconds is a comedic demonstration of the anti-tank gun in an anti-Nazi propaganda \\"sketch\\", while the second longer section uses both cartoon animation and live action sequences to demonstrate proper use and handling of the Mk.1 Boys Anti-Tank Rifle.Van Riper 2011, p. 22. Plot An armada of Nazi German tanks, led by Adolf Hitler, approaches a town, with Hitler announcing, ‚Äúthe enemy is asleep‚Äù and ordering his troops to ‚Äúgive ‚Äòem the works.‚Äù The tanks rush forward, firing into the sleepy town. Camouflaged Canadian soldiers, equipped with the Boys Mk.1 rifle, start to emerge from various secret positions to stop the advancing tanks, hitting them repeatedly with accurate rounds. Hitler‚Äôs tank receives a direct hit from the Canadian troops‚Äô fire and tumbles straight down into hell. In front of a huge, red, round-faced Satan, Hitler begins throwing an hysterical tantrum on the floor over his defeat. Satan, shouting over the increasingly loud and irrational tantrum, indicates Hitler believes that against the anti-tank rifle, he cannot win. The Boys anti-tank rifle is then described in detail through both animated and live action sequences. Using highly detailed schematic views, the design of the .55 calibre anti-tank rifle is analyzed. A demonstration of how to use the weapon stresses the need to accurately aim and \\"lead\\" a moving target, locate weak areas on armoured vehicles, and fire effectively at close range. Live action sequences demonstrate loading, firing, reloading, taking the weapon apart, cleaning and maintenance. This footage adds an air of authenticity ‚Äúby virtues of its photographic realism.‚Äù Cheu 2013, p. 27.Boys Anti-Tank Rifle The methodical and precise training section is intersected with moments of comic relief, although these are sparse and further display the educational nature of the film. First, a short, stout soldier attempts to lift the Mk.1 rifle but is not strong enough, and the rifle falls on top of his head and pins him down from the back of his neck. Next, a misjudged shot from the MK.1 Mk.1 rifle hits the backside of a bull in a nearby field, the bull angrily jumps rear end first into a pond and screeching ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you shoot where you‚Äôre looking?‚Äù A soldier who underestimates the strength of the internal spring when taking apart his weapon, has the spring comically bouncing out of the magazine into the face of the short soldier from earlier in the film. Finally, in invoking the old saw, ‚Äúa rifle is like a woman, treat her right and she will never let you down‚Äù; the short soldier cuddles in bed with his Mk.1 rifle, giving it a kiss. Treatment Although mainly focussed on the educational and training side of the film, Stop That Tank! contains strong anti-Nazi and anti-Hitler propaganda. Disney cartoonists reduce Hitler to a ridiculous and non-threatening laughing stock drawn as a bulbous, red nosed buffoon, whose tongue flaps and waves from his mouth with flushes of hot breath and saliva. He delivers a Nazi salute and cries ‚ÄúHeil!‚Äù to which five faceless and identical soldiers respond with a unanimous ‚ÄúHeil Hitler!‚Äù Hitler then begins a speech made up of a string of gibberish and nonsensical noises, punctuated by stereotypical German words such as ‚Äúsauerkraut‚Äù and ‚Äúschnitzel‚Äù which has to be subtitled for the audience to understand.\\"Movie cartoons show how an anti-tank gun works.' Popular Science, October 1942, pp. 62‚Äì63. In Hell, Satan becomes the audience‚Äôs translator for Hitler‚Äôs screamed gibberish and tells the audience that Hitler is screaming, ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt fair, I‚Äôm being oppressed, and it‚Äôs an outrage!‚Äù This representation of Hitler in hell takes a different approach than other cartoon shorts of the same nature from the war period. For example, in Frank Capra's Private Snafu ‚ÄúSpies‚Äù, Hitler is presented as Satan himself, a looming, evil figure leering over Private Snafu. In Disney‚Äôs portrayal, Satan is seen as not as a purely evil entity, but rather the calmer, sensible counterpart to Hitler‚Äôs hysterical and nonsensical behaviour. From this, Disney has created a version of Hitler who is laughable and is perceived to be easily defeated in order to reassure and boost the confidence of the Canadian soldiers for whom the film is intended.Shull and Wilt 2004, pp. 84, 197. The style and techniques of creating this tantrum- throwing, childish and incompetent Hitler character were being tested and experimented in early films such as Stop That Tank! and would be later developed in more prominent works such as Der Fuehrer‚Äôs Face (1943) and Education for Death (1943). Hitler‚Äôs ridiculous nature is highlighted in his outlandish and exaggerated movement, which sees him bulging and sweeping across the top of his tank, and later writhing on the ground in Hell. Unlike the later Disney anti-Nazi film, Der Fuhrer‚Äôs Face.Van Riper 2011, p. 27. The vaunted Nazi weaponry are also ridiculed, with Nazi tanks depicted as rickety, with their different parts bouncing up and down and coming apart from one another. The tanks develop their own faces to enable them to show their personified terror at the great damage being inflicted on their armoured bodies when, in a frenzied, cowardly retreat, the tanks are almost falling apart in their efforts to run from the bullets of the Canadian Mk.1 rifles. Boys Anti-Tank Rifle Stop That Tank! is basically a training film intended to be used in the Canadian Army. The Boys MK.1 rifles were produced in Canada by John Inglis and Company, and were distinguished primarily from other variants by the flat muzzle brake and V-shaped bipod.\\"The Inglis Story.\\" web.archive.org. Retrieved: March 7, 2016. After the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, the Boy‚Äôs anti-tank rifle had gained the reputation from British and Canadian soldiers as a ‚Äújinx‚Äù gun, due to its ineffectiveness on German tanks. With the introduction of more heavily armoured German vehicles, the Boys Mk.1 quickly lost its effectiveness as an anti-tank weapon. The recommended firing range was subsequently, reduced from 500 yards to 300 yards with its true effectiveness limited to within 100 yards of the target.\\"Boys Anti Tank Rifle.\\" Forgotten Weapons, 2011. Retrieved: March 7, 2016. Stop That Tank! was not only intended to educate Canadian troops on the operation of the Mk.1 rifle but also put new recruits and existing soldiers at ease regarding doubts about their weaponry. The extended \\"textbook\\" style treatment interspersed with humour as well as a propaganda message, was considered a very effective instructional tool. In a screening for members of the public, civilians felt that they had gained enough information \\"... to pick up a Mk.1 and blast a German tank out of existence.\\"\\"Movie cartoons show how an anti-tank gun works.\\" Popular Science, October 1942, p. 63. Production With the outbreak of a global war, Walt Disney Studios felt a great pinch in their finances due to the loss of much of their European markets. This was further limited with the invasion of France by Nazi forces in 1940, which meant that the next Disney release Pinocchio (1940) was only dubbed in Spanish and Portuguese, a great deal less languages than previous Disney works.Barrier 2003, p. 272. Due to this loss of profit, and losses on recent films, Disney studios faced a bleak outlook of a deficit of over half a million dollars, layoffs and pay cuts for the first time in the studio, and a $2.23 million ceiling on their credit allowance. With bleak prospects, the studio was made into a corporation in April 1940, which raised $3.6 million to help pay off debts owed by the studio. To enable his studios to keep afloat and producing films, Walt Disney sought out external funding to cover production costs, which would allow him to keep employees on the payroll and keep the studio working. In March 1941, Disney invited over three dozen different representatives of various national defence industries to a lunch meeting, in an attempt to solicit work from them.Stillich, Sven. Donald versus Hitler: Walt Disney and the Art of WWII Propaganda. Spiegel online, August 10, 2009. Retrieved: March 7, 2016.

Four Methods of Flush Riveting (1941) was first training film that was commissioned by Lockheed Aircraft. In response to Disney's efforts, John Grierson, the head of the National Film Board of Canada entered into a co-production agreement for four animated films to promote the Canadian War Savings Plan.Maltin 2000, p. 16. In addition, a training film for the Canadian Army, that eventually became Stop That Tank! was commissioned.St. Pierre, Marc. \\"70 years of animation, Part 1 ‚Äì When animation marches off to war.\\" NFB.ca, 2011. Retrieved: March 7, 2016. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Navy issued Disney a contract for 20 training films. Later, Disney had contracts totalling 50 training films for the navy, and went on to become the most important producer of training films for the United States military.\\"Walt Disney goes to War.\\" Life, October 31, 1942, p. 61. The style of realistic animation in Stop That Tank! was similar to that of the earlier Disney instructional film, Four Methods of Flush Riveting.Lesjak, David. \\"Disney to the front.\\" America in WWII. Retrieved: March 6, 2016. The need for accuracy in depicting the Boys Mk.1 and its inner workings, necessitated a Mk.1 rifle being shipped from Canada to California for Disney animators to study. After the release of four animated short films that were screened in Canada from November 1941 until early 1942, Stop That Tank! was the first internationally commissioned \\"technical\\" film by the Disney Studios and represented a \\"milestone\\" in the studio's history.\\"Stop that tank.\\" Life, October 31, 1942, p. 62. Reception Although not intended for a theatrical audience, Stop That Tank! was effective in delivering its message to Canadian troops through the Directorate of Military Training, Department of National Defence (Canada). Years later, the Disney Studios released Walt Disney On the Front Lines: The War Years as a DVD set on May 18, 2004, with Stop That Tank! appearing on Disk 2. In a modern assessment of the film, a reviewer noted: \\"... comic reliefs were very welcome during the otherwise extremely dry and boring instruction film. However, for contemporary audiences only the opening sequence remains of interest. Its strong and rather vicious propaganda was going to be echoed in a lot of cartoons during the war era.\\" In a recent Popular Mechanics review, Eric Limer described Stop That Tank! as \\"... an especially good illustration of Disney's instructional work, but 'Stop that Tank' was far from the only example of Disney's more explanatory work during the war. Between 1942 and 1945, Disney contributed footage to dozens upon dozens of films, often in the form of animated maps or diagrams that were plugged in-between lengthier live-action footage. Everything from methods for riveting to a crash-course in meteorology for pilots. While revisiting the more pungent animated propaganda of the time can be a little cringe-inducing, these instructional videos still hold up pretty well. They're educational artifacts about the weapons of a bygone area, as well as remnants of a fascinating partnership.\\" Limer, Eric. \\"The Disney cartoon that teaches you how to fire an anti-tank rifle: The finer points of tank-busting in animated form.\\" Popular Mechanics, December 2, 2015.

It imported its raw materials mainly from the Dutch East Indies and sold its products across Europe, making good profits especially in the early years of World War I. The NCF produced morphine, heroin and ephedrine as well. History In 1875, the first coca plants were transferred from Brazil to the colonial botanical garden \\"'s Lands Plantentuin te Buitenzorg\\" in Java.Roersch van der Hoogte, A. and Pieters, T. (2013); From Javanese Coca to Java Coca: An Exemplary Product of Dutch Colonial Agro-Industrialism, 1880-1920, published on-line through muse.jhu.edu Shortly after, commercial production started in Java, Madura and Sumatra. Coca leaves were exported, mainly to Germany, through the Koloniale Bank in Amsterdam. This trader of agricultural produce moved between 34 and 81 tons of leaves annually from 1892 to 1900. Because of growing demand and a steady supply the Koloniale Bank decided to start production of cocaine in Amsterdam and it founded the Nederlandsche Coca√Ønefabriek 12 March 1900. Production started in a building designed by Herman Hendrik Baanders. The building was expanded in 1902, but in 1909 the factory moved to another location. Cocaine was sold as a medication for a variety of chest and lung ailments, but it was used as a recreational drug as well. The NCF soon became one of the major cocaine producers in Europe. World War I At first, the NCF profited from World War I by taking over markets established by German market leader Merck, which was hit by an export ban.Bosman, p. 129. A Dutch ban on selling medical supplies to warring parties was enforced, but the NCF got an exemption. The NCF had been selling some of its cocaine to Burroughs Wellcome & Co, which used it in its Forced March, a product that was advertised with: \\"Allays hunger and prolongs the power of endurance\\". Wils, E.R.J. (2009); Nederlandse coca√Øne aan het oorlogsfront; published on-line through www.wereldoorlog1418.nl. Cocaine and opium were easily available to soldiers in for instance London's nightlife district of West End, until they were prohibited and brought under the Defence of the Realm Act in 1916. In 1917 unrestricted submarine warfare brought overseas imports virtually to a standstill, affecting the NCF just as well as others. Controlled substances Conferences in Shanghai (1909) and The Hague (1912) laid foundations for control of narcotics. In the Dutch Opium Law of 1919 cocaine became a controlled substance. For the NCF this meant it had to get a permit to produce and sell - which it did. In the early 1920s the NCF produced 20% of the world's cocaine. At the Geneva Convention of 1925 a system of certificates was decided upon, to regulate exports of strictly medical and scientific cocaine only. In the Netherlands, further legal restrictions were imposed in 1928 to limit the selling of cocaine to medical uses. This also affected the NCF, but as not all surrounding countries ratified the decisions of the Convention (immediately), some free sales of cocaine continued. By 1930 however, cocaine had become a marginal product and the NCF was switching to other products. Later years In the early 1930s the NCF started to manufacture opiates like morphine and codeine to fill the gap left by the disappearing market for cocaine. The market situation for these products was not positive however, and margins were small.Bosman, p. 195. At the outbreak of World War II the NCF saw increased profits on its opiates, because of market shortages. Under German occupation the NCF produced ephedrine, but a lack of raw materials soon affected the company. After the war production picked up again, with poppy straw imported from Turkey and Yugoslavia to produce morphine and other opiates. In 1962 the company's shares were acquired by KZO.Bosman, p. 227. Soon after KZO was able to buy NCF's major Dutch competitor VPF as well. KZO reorganised and merged the production of both, shutting down the Amsterdam facility. In 1975 the Nederlandsche Coca√Ønefabriek was renamed in NCF Holding BV, a company held by AkzoNobel.

Early life and background Born in Sagan in the Prussian Province of Silesia in 1847, Pelldram passed the matriculation examination in 1865, and studied jurisprudence at the Ruprecht-Karls- Universit√§t Heidelberg and the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t in Berlin from 1866 to 1869. In 1867, whilst a student in Berlin, Pelldram entered the 2nd Guards Uhlans Regiment, a reserve cavalry guards regiment of the Prussian Army in Berlin. He was promoted to Leutnant (the equivalent of Second Lieutenant) in 1869 and on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, served with his regiment as a part of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division in the Second Army commanded by Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. Pelldram served with distinction throughout the war, including in such engagements as Mars-la-Tour, Gravelotte, Sedan, the Siege of Paris, Orleans and Le Mans. For his service he received the Iron Cross Second Class in 1870. With the end of the war and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871, Pelldram resumed his career in the law and was appointed to the law courts of Breslau and in 1873 was promoted to the Superior Court at Wiesbaden. In 1875, Pelldram was appointed an assistant Judge at Wiesbaden. Diplomatic career In 1876, Pelldram entered the service of the Imperial Foreign Office and a year later was posted to the Consulate-General in Odessa, Russian Empire and not long after as a Vice- Consul at the German Embassy in St. Petersburg under Ambassador Hans Lothar von Schweinitz. In 1881 Pelldram was sent to China to serve as Consul in Tientsin and then to Canton and Hong Kong in 1885. In 1886 Pelldram was sent to Cairo as Consul-General and then Consul for Caucasia and Transcaucasia at Tiflis in 1887. In 1888 arrived in the Colony of New South Wales to serve as Consul-General of Germany for Australia based in Sydney, with additional responsibilities for New Zealand and Fiji. Pelldram was well receivedin the colony, with the Sydney Mail later noting: \\"In Herr Peldram we have a man of ' marked importance and ability,' and, as the Iron Cross conferred upon him testifies, of much higher qualities than the authority quoted laid down as a sine qua non.\\" Pelldram served as acting-Consul for Austria-Hungary in 1893 and 1894 and consequently hosted Archduke Franz Ferdinand on his visit to Sydney in May 1893 on board the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth. Pelldram also served as the Acting Consular Agent for Italy. Throughout his time in Sydney, Pelldram was assisted by the German Consul in Sydney, Carl Ludwig Sahl, who often officiated in his absence. When Sahl died in early 1897 Pelldram officiated at his funeral. In August 1897 Pelldram departed Sydney to take up an appointment as Consul-General in Antwerp. In 1900 Pelldram was appointed as the German Resident Minister for Haiti in Port-au-Prince and in 1903 took up his final appointment as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Venezuela in Caracas.

It was one of the two largest circulation magazines for skiers. Early years Merrill Hastings launched Rocky Mountain Skiing in 1948, a news-oriented magazine that soon developed into a national publication. In 1950, it changed its name to the National Skiing Newspaper; it became National Skiing in 1954; and its name was changed to Skiing in 1956. The magazine competed aggressively with Ski magazine, which was run by Bill Eldred. In the early years, the magazine was not entirely objective in its reviews, favoring resorts and equipment makers who advertised in its pages. Circulation rose to almost 50,000 in the first ten years. New York In 1964, the Ziff Davis company of New York bought Skiing magazine and Skiing Trade News from Hastings, and moved operations to New York. The company's owner, Bill Ziff, raided Ski magazine for experienced staff. Luray, the first editor, wanted a slick magazine, but Ziff had decided it should be more serious, aimed at dedicated skiers, and he replaced Luray with Doug Pfeiffer, a ski school director from California. Pfeiffer was editor in chief of Skiing magazine and its sister publications Skiing Trade News, Skiing Area News and Skiing International Yearbook from 1965 to 1976. Under Ziff, in 1965, the magazine started to issue test reports on skis. To avoid upsetting advertisers, none of the reports were negative. Due to the timing of new model releases, the skis being tested and the conditions under which they were being tested did not typically match the skis and conditions that the readers would be experiencing. Pfeiffer was followed as editor by John Jerome and then Al Greenberg. In 1985, Ziff Davis sold Skiing and other magazines to the broadcaster CBS, and in 1987 CBS sold the magazines to Peter Diamandis. Later that year, Skiing magazine was bought for $25 million by the Times Mirror company, which also owned the rival Ski magazine. Times Mirror was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago in 2000, and the following year Skiing, Ski and other magazines were sold to Time4 Media, a subsidiary of Time Inc. By this time, the traditional skiing magazines were facing fierce competition from ski-related websites. In 2006, it was announced that the magazines would be sold again. Present day In 2013, Skiing was purchased by Active Interest Media, a 50 magazine publisher based in Boulder, Colorado, who in the winter of 2017/2018 incorporated the assets of Skiing into its sister publication SKI magazine, ceasing its publication after nearly 70 years.

She is a professor of Mesoamerican archaeology at the University at Albany, SUNY. She is a co-director of the PEMY (Proyecto los Fundamentos Ec√≥nomico de Mayap√°n/Economic Foundations of Mayap√°n Project ) project at the site of Mayapan in the Northern Yucutan Peninsula of Mexico.  Education and academic career  According to her curriculum vitae Marilyn Masson earned her Bachelor of Arts in anthropology from Texas A&M; University in 1982, her Master of Science in anthropology from Florida State University in 1987, and her Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993. Her Ph.D dissertation is titled Changes in Maya Community Organization from the Classic to Postclassic Periods: A View from Laguna de On, Belize. Her Master's thesis focused on lithic production changes in Late Classic Maya workshops at the site of Colha in Belize. She has a wide array of archaeological interests including household archaeology, ancient urbanism, archaeological political economy, craft production, zooarchaeology, lithic and ceramic analysis, and the archaeology of religion. Most of her academic career has been spent teaching as an Assistant Professor (1996-2002), an Associate Professor (2002‚Äì2011) and as Professor (2011 to present) at the University of Albany SUNY. She has taught and teaches a variety of undergraduate and graduate level classes, including Aztec Inca Maya, Maya Art and Archaeology, Stone Tool Analysis, Zooarchaeology, Archaeological Lab Methods, The Archaeology of Urban Life, Current Theories on the Ancient Maya, and Ethnohistory and Archaeology. Prior to earning her Ph.D., she spent time working as an archaeologist in Florida and Texas.  Mesoamerican research  Masson has worked extensively throughout the southern Mexico/Maya region. She has directed the Belize Postclassic Project (1996-2002) and the Economic Foundations of Mayapan project (2001 to present). Earlier in her career, she participated in research at sites in Belize such as Colha, Kichpanha, K'axob, and also in Oaxaca. The newest phase of her research focuses on regional and temporal variation in the northern Plains of Yucat√°n in the environs of the city of Mayapan. This focus examines rural-urban relationships of the Classic to Postclassic period, specifically to determine degrees of wealth, trade dependency, and occupational diversification at rural houselots and commoner dwellings at minor centers. These provide an important complement to her team's prior work within the walled urban zone of Mayapan that exhibits considerable inter-household and inter-regional dependencies on exchange, as well as pronounced commoner wealth and occupational variation. Reconstructing ancient economies must consider urban-rural dependencies and patterns for a more robust view. In 2013 she co-directed the Mayapan LiDAR project with Tim Hare (Morehead State University, Carlos Peraza (INAH Yucat√°n) and Brad Russell (College of St. Rose). This work identified abundant, nearly continuous (low density) distributions of houses (of multiple time periods) across a 40 km2 zone beyond the city walls. Her work in 2015 with this team excavated eight houses (four Terminal Classic, four Postclassic) in the hinterland outside of the city walls. These efforts to document and compare rural economies to urban ones, and to adopt a regional, rather than site-level approach, will continue in forthcoming years.  Mayapan  Current work at Mayapan is conducted within the scope of the Economic Foundations of Mayap√°n Project (PEMY), funded by the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, the Center for Social and Demographic Analysis, and the College of Arts and Sciences (UAlbany SUNY).

It was built in 1962, refurnished in the late 1980s and reopened in the early 1990s before it was re-branded in 2009. It's a venue to stage both Broadway musicals and home grown productions. It is one of the few theatres open in Johannesburg for independent productions. History The idea for a theatre has its origins in 1959 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Union of South Africa called the Union Festival, when an initial fund of R100,000 was set aside by the Johannesburg City Council for an event and when the city was excluded from arranging a cultural event by the South African government, the idea of using the money for a civic theatre was introduced. Initially the idea was for a 750-seat theatre but this was soon scrapped in favour of a 1120-seat facility. Johannesburg City Council Mayor, Alec Gorshel, would break the ground at a ceremony at the construction site on 16 September 1960. Johannesburg Civic Theatre was completed in 1962, at a cost of R720,000 and was opened with a gala event on 27 August 1962, attended by the Mayor of Johannesburg and other civic dignitaries. The first production was Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann with the next 31 weeks devoted to operas, ballet, dramas' light music and recitals with 145,000 guests attending in the first year and by the end of 1963, the figure had risen to 216,000. The theatre, owned by council, would be managed by the non-profit Johannesburg Civic Theatre Association which up until 1992 was made up of all white governors and management committee consisting of city council members and civic leaders. Johannesburg councillor Pieter M. Roos was its first chairman. From its opening in 1962, the theatre was open to white people only due to the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953, which made mixed audiences at live theatre a criminal act. By April 1978, theatres could apply to open their seating to integrated audiences. The late 1970s saw the beginnings of an international cultural boycott of South Africa by international performers, playwrights and of new works and this affected what was available for production at the Civic Theatre and this boycott would continue until the early 1990s. A more local effect on the size of audiences attending the theatre was caused by the introduction of television in South Africa in January 1976. A puppet theatre was established at the Civic Theatre in 1964. Children were entertained outside the complex, at the Rand Easter Show and by the use of a city bus that had been outfitted as a mobile theatre. The theatre was attended by international puppeteer companies. The puppet theatre was disbanded in 1987 and the puppets were donated to Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) now the University of Johannesburg. The Theatre was closed for two years of renovations in 1987 costing R29 million but it would be five years before the theatre reopened having cost R120 million. The backstage facilities and technical areas were overhauled, the main theatres height increased, and electrical work, lightning and cooling and heating improved. To reopen in September 1992, the theatre failed to secure an international act for its opening night. Les Mis√©rables international producers cancelled and after much negotiation with the anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, the Dance Theatre of Harlem was the replacement production co-produced by the Market Theatre.

The College officially opened its doors on April 8, 2013 and its activities are mandated by the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009 (OCTAA). The current Ontario government is winding down its operations. Organization The College is governed by a board of governors with 21 members-4 members from construction, industrial, motive power, and service fields. In addition each trade is represented by a trade board consisting of 4-12 members, consisting of an equal number of employers and employees. The organization itself is staffed by approximately 150 professional and enforcement staff in various departments including Standards, Policy & Research, Compliance & Enforcement, Communications, and Corporate Governance. All members of the governing structure are appointed by an independent Appointments Council, who are in turn appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Membership Skilled trades in Ontario consist of two broad categories: # Compulsory trades require certification for a person to engage in the practice of the trade. Examples of compulsory trades are: electrician, tower crane operator, automotive service technician, and hairstylist . # Voluntary trades do not require certification for a person to engage in the practice of the trade. Examples of non-compulsory trades are: construction millwright, general carpenter, arborist, and cook. Under the 'Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009, (OCTAA) one cannot hold themselves as having a Certificate of Qualification in either a compulsory trade or voluntary trade unless they are a member of the College (with some exceptions). As well, all apprentices must be members of the College. Those holding Certificates of Qualification in voluntary trades before 2013 who have opted to not join the College are not required to present their Certificate of Qualification to inspectors. As well, they cannot have their Certificate of Qualification suspended or revoked by the College but as per all members, must abide by the College's Code of Ethics. To maintain membership, members are charged a membership fee. There are a number of different membership classes: * Apprentices - $60/yr * Journeyperson Candidates - $60/yr * Non-certified tradespersons - $60/yr * Journeypersons - $120/yr * Employers and sponsors - $120/yr Mandate of Ontario College of Trades According to OCTAA, in order to ensure the safety and certification of qualifications for all journeypersons in the 23 compulsory trades and all apprentices regardless of their trades‚Äô classification, membership in the College is legally required. All members are searchable on the College‚Äôs Public Register, which is an online database that enables anyone to easily confirm the qualifications of any compulsory tradesperson or apprentice before hiring them to fix their toilet, wire their house, change their brakes or cut/colour their hair. Like all regulatory bodies in Ontario, the College is required to be financially self-sustaining, and just like the College of Teachers or the College of Nurses, the Ontario College of Trades is funded entirely through membership fees. Fees go towards the establishment of apprenticeship training programs, updating training and curriculum standards‚Äîsome of which have not been updated in 20 years‚Äî and exams, promotion of trades to youth and underrepresented groups, and compliance activities. Dean Report In 2015, former Secretary of Cabinet Tony Dean released a report making a number of recommendations to support the development of the College of Trades. The recommendations in the report encompassed many areas including governance models, noting that most professional organizations have some membership elected representation. However; the primary areas covered were scopes of practice, trade classification and reclassification reviews, ratio reviews, and enforcement. A number of construction trade unions, including the Ontario Sheet Metal Workers Conference and the International Brotherhood of Metal Workers opposed the report because it lacked consultation with stakeholders. However; the largest construction union in North America, LiUNA, has expressed cautious optimism and support for the report. Since the release of this report, several regulations based on its recommendations have been passed by government and the College has been working on the implementation of most of Dean's suggestions.

He is best known for his unsuccessful power struggle for control of Egypt against Ahmad ibn Tulun in 868‚Äì871. Biography Abu'l-Hasan and his brother, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, were possibly of Persian origin. Both were distinguished men of letters and rose to prominence at the court of the Abbasids at Samarra. Abu'l-Hasan first appears as director of the department of the army (dƒ´wƒÅn al-jaysh) under Caliph al-Wathiq (ruled 842‚Äì847). Under al- Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), he rose further. The Caliph esteemed his ability as a poet, and appointed him to oversee seven dƒ´wƒÅns, possibly as a sort of deputy vizier. In 854, however, the current vizier, Ubayd Allah ibn Khaqan, seeing in him a dangerous rival, had him imprisoned. This disgrace did not last long, and soon he was released and appointed as fiscal administrator ( øƒÅmil al- kharƒÅj, \\"supervisor of the land tax\\") for the Syrian districts of Damascus and Jordan. From there he moved, probably in 861, to the same post in Egypt. To boost the province's revenue, he took a series of measures, including doubling the kharƒÅj and the jizya and raising new taxes (muk≈´s)‚Äîa move widely denounced as un-Quranic, demanding the payment of taxes each lunar year (instead of the longer solar year), imposing a state monopoly on caustic soda, and depriving the Christian clergy of their traditional tax privileges and exemptions. As a result, he became both the most powerful, as well as the most hated man in Egypt, and was constantly escorted by a hundred young bodyguards. His fall began in September 868, with the arrival of a new governor of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. Abu'l-Hasan tried to win Ibn Tulun over by offering him a large cash gift, but Ibn Tulun refused. For the next four years, the two men conducted a struggle for power both within Egypt, as well as through their relatives and envoys at the Abbasid court. Ibn Tulun emerged the victor from this contest: in 871 he overthrew and imprisoned Abu'l-Hasan, confiscated his possessions, and took over the fiscal administration of Egypt himself. Abu'l-Hasan was released and sent to Syria (871/2), where he took up again his old post as  øƒÅmil for Damascus and Jordan, as well as for Palestine. In 877, however, Ibn Tulun took over Syria as well, and upon his entry in Damascus Abu'l-Hasan was imprisoned and forced to pay a ransom of 600,000 dirhams. He was then brought to Egypt, where he died, still imprisoned, in 883/4. Ibn al-Nadim's KitƒÅb al- Fihrist reports that he was the author of a now lost KitƒÅb al-MujƒÅlasa wa ‚Äôl-mudhƒÅkara (\\"Book of Companionship and Conversation\\"), while scattered poems and anecdotes concerning his life are preserved in various collections and historical works.

Situated on the bank of Gundlakamma River, the site is northwest of Donakonda railway station. The Chandavaram Buddhist site was built between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE during the Satavahana dynasty and was discovered by Dr. Veluri Venkata Krishna Sastry in 1964. History The first of its kind in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the Chandavaram Buddhist site was constructed between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE. It was an active center for Buddhist religious activities, and was also inhabited at the time. The age of the site was determined by the carbon dating of artifacts discovered during excavation. The sculptural panels in the site are of the Amaravati school which also suggests that the site was built between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE. The Chandavaram Buddhist site was used as a resting place by Buddhist monks travelling from Kashi to Kanchi. Discovered in 1964, the site was constructed during the Satavahana dynasty. Ayaka pillars are absent from the site, indicating that the Hinayana form of Buddhism was prevalent in Chandavaram. The site houses a double terraced MahaStupa on a hilltop which is next in importance only to Sanchi Stupa. The hill on which the MahaStupa is located is called Singarakonda. Construction and structure Constructed during the Satavahana dynasty, the Chandavaram Buddhist site houses a double terraced MahaStupa built on an elevated platform situated on a hilltop. The MahaStupa exhibits the characteristics of stupas built under the Hinayana form of Buddhism. The main dome (MahaStupa) is in circumference and high. It has carved panels that portray the Dharmachakra (the wheel of Dharma, one of the Ashtamangala of Indian religions such as Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism). Apart from the main stupa, the site also houses several Viharas, Brahmi inscriptions and other stupas. In the MahaStupa, there is a Maha Chaitya which is high and wide. The MahaStupa resembles the Dharmarajika stupa in Taxila, Pakistan. The panels on the MahaStupa are made of limestone. The panels and the drum sections of the MahaStupa exhibit the Buddha footprint, Stupas, Bodhi trees and also narratives in the form of Jataka tales along with other stories. Since 1964, the Chandavaram Buddhist site has been excavated four times, and fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small stupas have been discovered. The site comprises the following: *Main Stupa (MahaStupa) *Maha Chaitya *Museum *Silamandapa *Vihara *Votive Stupas Buddha statue, now at the Hussain Sagar, Hyderabad. Monolith statue of Buddha In 1985, a project called the \\"Buddha Poornima Project\\" was proposed. Under this project, the world's tallest standing monolith statue of Buddha was to be erected on the site. Made out of granite, the statue was carved by 200 sculptors in two years and on completion it weighed 440 tonnes with an overall height of . However, the Buddha statue was transported to city of Hyderabad in 1988 instead, where it was erected in 1992 in the Hussain sagar lake and stands today. Archeological findings One MahaStupa, fifteen regular-sized and approximately one hundred small Stupas have been discovered in the Chandavaram Buddhist site. Apart from the Maha Chaitya, Silamandapa, Vihara and the Votive Stupas, more than two dozen \\"Buddhist slabs\\" (decorated with designs and inscriptions) have also been discovered. Pilferage Pilferage of artefacts has been reported at the Chandavaram Buddhist site since the year 2000. In Oct 2000, two long panels, with engravings of the Bodhi tree and of the Chaitra were uprooted from a cement platform and stolen from the site's museum. In February 2001, three pillars, each measuring long and including one in which the Buddha was represented as fire were stolen. In March 2001, three more ornate pillars and a lotus medallion were stolen.

It was preceded by the 1910 election and followed, due to the First World War, by the 1919 election. Overview of the Result As in most parts of Wales, the Liberal Party was once again triumphant and won a majority of the seats. The Conservatives made some impact, as did the Labour Party, although in case of the latter there was no sign of a breakthrough. Boundary Changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Contested Elections 49 of the 66 councilors were returned unopposed. Only a small number of those seats that were contested changed hands. In many areas, contests between Liberal and Labour candidates were avoided and the Progressive label widely adopted. The Conservatives gained two seats at Llandeilo Talybont and Llansamlet while Labour lost at both Cwmavon and Ystalyfera. This was counterbalanced by a Labour victory at Pontardawe. Details of all contested elections are listed here. Aberdare and Mountain Ash All eight members were returned unopposed in the Aberdare Valley and no Labour candidates entered the fray. Bridgend and Maesteg districts There were a number of contested elections in this area. Swansea, Pontardawe and Port Talbot districts In these areas the Conservatives again performed well, mainly at the expense of the Liberals. Results Aberaman Aberavon Abercynon Aberdare Town Bargoed Barry Barry Dock Blaengwawr Bridgend Randall was again returned unopposed, with the Liberals deciding not to oppose him.

Tylorstown and Ynyshir Sitting councillor Dr T.H. Morris stood down to allow Alderman W.H. Mathias to be returned unopposed. Vale of Neath Ystalyfera Ystrad Clifford Cory, the member since 1892, was once again returned unopposed. Election of Aldermen In addition to the 66 councillors the council consisted of 22 county aldermen. Boundary changes following the secession of Merthyr kept the number of councillors at 66 through the creation of additional wards. The number of aldermen therefore remained unchanged. Aldermen were elected by the council, and served a six- year term. Following the 1910 election, there were twelve Aldermanic vacancies rather than eleven owing to the resignation of John Davies, an alderman elected for a Merthyr ward. The following aldermen were appointed by the newly elected council. elected for six years Thomas, W. M. David G. h- Fleming, Rhys 11 airies, Dd. Hughes G. J. Hughes, W. Jones, J.

In an allegory of the rising sea levels produced by climate change, the aquarium is animated by a powerful custom hydraulic system that pumps up to 15 tons of water in and out in less than a minute, creating a series of mini-floods to which the performers must adapt. Over the course of several hours, a series of performers play variously the guitar, sell fruit, don an abaya, uncoil a garden hose, and perform other familiar tasks as the water rises and falls around each in turn.

The trackway is the second confirmed archaeological structure from Hatfield and Thorne Moors. The Lindholme Trackway dates to around 2900‚Äì2500 BC. Context Situated in the Humberhead Levels, Hatfield Moor and Thorne Moor form part of the largest raised peat mire in England. The moors have been drained, improved for agriculture and the peat extracted for fuel and compost since the Bronze Age; however, these processes were continually industrialised from the 17th century until the late 20th century. Hatfield Moor and Thorne Moor are currently undergoing a long term management plan of restoration and conservation. Discovery In October 2004 a number of worked wooden poles were discovered by a local man, Mick Oliver, who was walking across the site. The site is sometimes known as the Oliver Track (presumably in comparison to the Sweet Track), or Lindholme Track. Further investigation, including excavation, survey and palaeoenvironmental work, showed that the site was a late neolithic timber trackway, about 45m long, extending from dry land across a shallow pool to a wooden platform. Neolithic Period It was during the time the timber trackway was built that the local environment began to change. Previous paleo-environmental studies on the moor indicate peat growth began around 3000BC. The radiocarbon date from the east of the site of 5470-5220 cal. BC is the earliest available on Hatfield Moor for wetland inception and indicated the northern part of Hatfield Moor was one of the earliest foci for peat formation.Chapman and Geary (2014). Modelling Archaeology and Palaeo- environments in Wetlands. The site was constructed during a period of environmental transformation, where evidence from the coleopteran analyses demonstrated the site was built at a time of increasingly wet and acidic conditions. Modelling produced by Chapman and Geary (2014) illustrate the trackway was built across and into a pool that marks the earliest known area of wetland development, at the northernmost edge of Lindholme Island. Where evidence also shows the Pinus dominated woodland beginning to die back in places. It is with this evidence along with analysis of the context of the site that the purpose of the structure can begin to be understood. Structure The trackway consist of 50m of timber trackway leading from Lindholme Island north at 345'. It is the only example where both termini have been excavated allowing the functionality of the site to be exposed. ‚ÄòThe Hatfield trackway- condition assessment‚Äô acknowledged it was in class 2 decay, and the wood was considered in a state of moderate decay with a preserved inner core but softer decayed outer layers. The assessment demonstrated the wood had lost elasticity and species identification was impossible on a large number of samples indicating the wood had undergone severe decay and biodeteriation resulting in the loss of cellulose and sugar molecules from the cell walls.Chapman (2006). The Hatfield Trackway & platform, Hatfield Moors, Interim Report-evaluation and proposals The platform and trackway were built of locally available wood, but it is believed that the selection of the wood probably had a deeper resonance with the builders. One recognised material was Birch (Betula) bark which is thought to have been utilised for is whiteness and to have been selected for its visibility amongst the greys and browns of the pool muds. It has also been identified as relating to notions including social cohesion and continuity, unconcealed openness and birth.Turner (1966) cited in Chapman and Geary (2014) The design of trackway narrows at the platform edge, providing a specific visual impression from the land edge. This is thought to have created an intentional 'forced perspective' which would have also controlled the movement of its users. allowing several people to walk along the platform at its land edge but enabled single file access to the platform. The location of the trackway is significant in that it is not situated closer to the drier land. it is situated parallel with the dryland ridge which would have allowed people on dry land to view the activities taking place on the structure. Allowing the interpretation to be made that the structure was in fact used as an arena for performances, entertainment and ceremonies. Although no contemporary parallels can be drawn from other trackways regarding the interpretation of its use comparisons can be made to more modern cultural traditions involving ceremonies and rituals enacted where physically separated by waters around the platforms Edmonds 1993 cited in Chapman and Geary 2014 Peat Geochemistry At the time of the condition assessment the soil was recorded to be acidic above and below the track, with high organic content and low levels of nitrate with sulphides, sulphates and sulphur present in low concentrations. The availability of the last three substrates evidenced the conditions around the trackway were reducing meaning immediate action was necessary for the trackways continued preservation.Chapman (2006). The Hatfield Trackway & platform, Hatfield Moors, Interim Report-evaluation and proposals Preservation and current condition In situ preservation was recommended for the trackway as a viable management strategy- assuming water levels could be maintained at a level above the timber and the peat saturated throughout. However this brought about new and problematic issues regarding the site's management that had to be overcome by the creation of innovative preservation techniques and policies.Chapman (2006). The Hatfield Trackway & platform, Hatfield Moors, Interim Report- evaluation and proposals In 2017 the trackway was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument by Historic England. In 2018 the trackway was proposed for inclusion on the heritage at risk register The Humberhead Peatlands have become a flagship enterprise for peat conservationists as well as for the archaeological assets held within.

Formed in 1801, the battery has taken part in the Napoleonic Wars (notably the Battle of Waterloo where it earned its Honour Title as Mercer's Troop), the Indian Mutiny, the Second Boer War and the First and Second World Wars. In 1961, it was given a parachute role as part of 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and has seen considerable active service particularly in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner), the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. History Napoleonic Wars The battery was formed on 1 September 1801 as G Troop, Horse Artillery at Mallow, County Cork, Ireland as a horse artillery battery of the British Army. It was involved in the capture of Buenos Aires in 1806. Memorial stone marking the position where Mercer's troop fought French cavalry on the Waterloo battlefield. The troop's best known action during the Napoleonic Wars came in June 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo. Under the command of Captain Mercer, the battery was equipped with five 9 pounder cannons and a 5¬Ω\\" howitzer. Initially placed on the right, it was ordered to assist in repelling an attack by French cavalry at the centre of the allied line. It beat off repeated charges by the French, disobeying previously issued orders from the Duke of Wellington that gunners were to abandon the guns and take refuge inside nearby infantry squares as the enemy closed. In commemoration of this action, the troop was named after Mercer. In the usual post-war reductions of the British Army, a number of troops of horse artillery were disbanded between 1815 and 1816, including D Troop (Beane's Troop) on 31 July 1816. The remaining troops were then moved up to assume the next available letter and the G Troop became F Troop on the same date. Indian Mutiny The troop was dispatched to India in 1858 to assist in the final operations to quell the Indian Rebellion of 1857. From 1 July 1859, while still in Bengal, it was assigned to the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery along with all the existing horse artillery batteries of the Royal Artillery. This was an administrative, rather than tactical, formation. As a result of the Rebellion, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Horse Brigade RA became the 1st Horse Brigade RA and the Bengal, Madras and Bombay horse artillery formed the 2nd to 5th Horse Brigades. Late Victorian era The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). Therefore, a reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades. The battery was moved to B Brigade, and as battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, it was redesignated as C Battery, B Brigade (or C/B Battery in short). From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the battery was designated C Battery, B Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each); the battery joined A Brigade and became G Battery, A Brigade. The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882 without effecting the designation of the battery. The brigade system was finally abolished on 1 July 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation and the battery took on its final designation as G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery. Equipped with six 12 pounders, the battery was sent to South Africa with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and saw active service in the Second Boer War including the Battle of Magersfontein (11 December 1899) and the Battle of Paardeberg (27 February 1900). First World War The brigade system was reintroduced on 1 March 1901, this time as tactical formations, and the battery was assigned to the XI Brigade-Division, RHA (redesignated as V Brigade, RHA on 1 October 1906) along with O Battery and was stationed at Ambala. Photo showing 13 pounder gun team galloping into action. By the time the First World War broke out, the battery had been re-equipped with six quick-firing 13 pounders and was stationed at Ipswich, still assigned to V Brigade with O Battery and attached to the 5th Cavalry Brigade. On 9 October 1914, the newly reformed Z Battery, RHA joined the brigade and they joined 8th Division when it was formed at Winchester. With 8th Division, it crossed to France on 4 and 5 November 1914 (landing at Le Havre on 6 and 7 November). On 24 November 1914, G Battery was transferred to XV (later IV) Brigade, RHA in 3rd Cavalry Division. In practice, the batteries were permanently assigned to the cavalry brigades and G Battery served with 8th Cavalry Brigade. It joined too late to take part in any of the 1914 actions, but in 1915 saw action in the Second Battle of Ypres (Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, 11‚Äì13 May) and the Battle of Loos (26‚Äì28 September). 1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 it took part in the Battle of Arras (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9‚Äì12 April). At other times, the battery served in the trenches as infantry. In March 1918, the 4th (formerly 1st Indian) and 5th (formerly 2nd Indian) Cavalry Divisions were broken up in France. The Indian elements were sent to Egypt where they formed part of the new 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which played a major part in the successful conclusion of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The British and Canadian units remained in France and most of them were transferred to the 3rd Cavalry Division causing it to be extensively reorganized. In March 1918, 8th Cavalry Brigade was broken up. It was replaced in 3rd Cavalry Division by the Canadian Cavalry Brigade with its attached Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Brigade (A and B Batteries, RCHA each with four 13 pounders) from the disbanding 5th Cavalry Division. On 13 March, G Battery was posted to XVII Brigade, RHA (formerly with 5th Cavalry Division) to bring it back up to three batteries. This was a short-lived arrangement: on 9 April, G and N Batteries left for V Army Brigade RHA. At some point, the battery was re-armed with 18 pounders. At the Armistice, V Army Brigade RHA was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army with G, N, O and Z Batteries RHA (twenty four 18 pounders). Inter-war period The battery took part in the Victory Parade in Paris in July 1919, and returned to the United Kingdom (Aldershot) from Germany in October. Still assigned to V Brigade, it remained at Aldershot until November 1926 when it was transferred to Meerut. In 1927, V Brigade was broken up and the battery remained at Meerut, unbrigaded. The battery remained horsed until it departed India in 1939; in May it transferred to Egypt along with C and F Batteries. On arrival at Helmieh on 28 May, they formed 4th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery. From 1938 artillery regiments were reorganized from three six-gun batteries to two 12-gun batteries. Rather than disband existing batteries, they were instead linked in pairs. As a result, G Battery was linked with F Battery to form F/G Battery on 28 May 1939. In the event, the batteries were unlinked within months (on 25 November 1939) and the battery resumed its individual existence. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War, the battery was still linked with F Battery as F/G Battery in 4th Regiment, RHA and still in Egypt. It was unlinked on 25 November 1939 and simultaneously assigned to the 5th Regiment, RHA at Wotton- under-Edge, Gloucestershire. It remained part of 5th RHA for the rest of the war. Gunners of 'G' Battery (Mercer's Troop), Royal Horse Artillery, inside a pillbox, 29 October 1940 (IWM H5110) In 1940, the 5th RHA formed part of the British Expeditionary Force in France. After being evacuated at Dunkirk it joined Home Forces in the United Kingdom before being assigned to the 8th Support Group, 8th Armoured Division. On 8 May 1942, it departed the United Kingdom to take part in the North African Campaign. It arrived in Egypt on 18 Julythe long sea journey being due to transiting via the Cape of Good Hope. 8th Armoured Division never operated as a complete formation and the regiment served with 23rd Armoured Brigade Group (Defence of the El Alamein Line and the Battle of Alam el Halfa) and 24th Armoured Brigade Group (Battle of El Alamein). On 1 December 1942, it joined 7th Armoured Division and remained with it for the rest of the war. It took part in the rest of the Western Desert Campaign, the Tunisian Campaign and, briefly, the Italian Campaign (9 September15 October 1943). It returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944 to prepare for the invasion of Europe. It fought in the North-West Europe Campaign from 8 July 1944 through to the end of the war. Post-war Post- war, the battery remained part of the 5th RHA, equipped with Sexton 25 pounder self-propelled guns. It was stationed variously as Osnabr√ºck, Larkhill and Cwrt y Gollen, Crickhowell. In February 1958, 5th RHA reverted to the Royal Artillery as 5th Field Regiment, RA and the battery was transferred to 4th RHA in exchange for P Battery. It was now equipped with Cardinal 155mm self- propelled guns and stationed at Hohne. ISAF soldiers with 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery fire their 105mm Light Gun at Taliban positions. Kajaki, Afghanistan, 28 August 2008 In 1961, it was decided to convert 33rd Parachute Light Regiment RA into a RHA regiment. As a result, 4th RHA reverted to the Royal Artillery as 4th Regiment Royal Artillery and its three batteriesF, G and I were transferred to 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery on 27 June 1961. Initially equipped with the 105mm Pack Howitzer, in 1974 the battery (and regiment) was re-armed with the L118 light gun which remains its equipment. Other than a period from 1977 to 1984 when the battery (and the regiment) was rerolled as a field artillery unit and posted to the BAOR in Germany, it has been based in England, initially at Aldershot but latterly at Colchester. Since 1961, it has been posted to Kuwait in 1961, Aden in 1964, a number of roulement tours to Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) in the infantry role, Cyprus as part of UNFICYP (June to December 1994), Bosnia in December 1996, Macedonia and Kosovo (Operation Agricola) in June 1999, Sierra Leone (Operation Silkman) in May 2000, Afghanistan (Operation Jacana) in 2001 and 2002, the Gulf War (Operation Telic) from March 2003, and Afghanistan again (Operation Herrick) in 2008.

McManus, 577 U.S. ___ (2015), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified when United States District Court judges must refer cases to three-judge panels. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court ruled that federal district courts are required to refer cases to a three-judge panel when plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts., slip op. at 1, 4 (2015). The case results from citizens in Maryland that had challenged the state's redistricting based on the 2010 Census created by Democratic leaders in the state, leading to Republican voters in the 6th district to find their votes diluted and causing ten-term U.S. Representative Roscoe Bartlett to lose in the 2012 election. The plaintiffs charged that their rights of equal representation and protection under the Article One, Section Two of the U.S. Constitution and freedom of association of the First Amendment had been violated. At the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the judge denied the request for a full three-judge hearing, considering that the plaintiff's claims were insubstantial; the decision was summarily affirmed in the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court.Benisek v. Mack, 11 F. Supp. 3d 516 (D. Md. 2014); affirmed, 584 F. App'x 140 (4th Cir. 2014). The plaintiffs subsequently challenged the District Court's ruling via petition to the Supreme Court on the basis that the dismissal did not properly consider their claims. The Supreme Court agreed, ordering a full three-judge hearing at the District Court. The hearing at District Court led to another Supreme Court case, Benisek v. Lamone, accepted in December 2017 and heard in March 2018, in which the Supreme Court found that the District Court's denial of an injunction was not improper, but otherwise did not weigh in on the merits of the gerrymandering aspects..

The museum is surrounded by the Hogback Mountain Conservation Area, over 600 acres of protected forest land, with views of three states. The Museum was established in 1996 around the Luman Ranger Nelson Natural History Collection, one of the largest collections of native birds and mammals in the northeast, with 250 species represented. The museum's founder Ed Metcalfe intended the museum to serve as an educational resource for local communities and visitors to the area. Exhibits are focused on a taxidermy collection but also include a variety of small hands-on exhibits for children, a mineralogy exhibit and a variety of native live animals. all of the live animals are non-releasable due mostly to physical handicaps The Museum presents a variety of natural history and environmental science programs throughout central New England, western New York and Vermont. Live animals Live animals were first brought to the Museum in 1998 with the establishment of a small raptor center for birds under rehabilitation, and a live trout tank and painted turtle exhibit were established. Other animal exhibits were created, and in 2013 a large bald eagle enclosure was built and the first of two resident eagles arrived. Most of the native wildlife at the museum were injured and cannot be released back into the wild. As of winter 2015 the Museum exhibits a bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, American kestrel, screech owl, Northern saw-whet owl, barred owl, king snake, corn snake, black rat snake, painted turtle, wood turtle, box turtle, snapping turtle, wood frog, tarantula, hissing cockroaches, trout and warm water fish. A raven and domestic rabbit live off- site and are used for educational programs. Collection An exhibit in the museum The Museum's natural history collection is primarily the work of Luman Ranger Nelson, a naturalist and taxidermist of the early 1900s. The collection includes nearly 250 species of bird and mammal found in the northeastern United States, and over 600 individual mounts. It is the largest collection of its kind in Vermont and one of the largest in the region. The collection includes a number of threatened and endangered species, many albino specimens as well as three extinct northeastern birds. Nelson was born in 1874 in Bernardston, Massachusetts. As an adult, he lived in Winchester, New Hampshire until his death in 1966. In his late 1930s he assembled a collection of northeastern birds and mammals. When the collection began there were very few regulations to limit shooting of wild animals. This is no longer the case, and by the end of his life, Nelson had acquired a number of special permits allowing him to complete the collection. Today, a collection like this would be difficult to create. Although individual specimens were acquired earlier or later in his life, the bulk of this work was done in the 1920s and 1930s. museum staff lead hikes on the adjacent conservation area or off-site References Museums in Windham County, Vermont Natural history museums in Vermont Nature centers in Vermont Buildings and structures in Marlboro, Vermont ","title":"Southern Vermont Natural History Museum"},{"id":"48763384","text":"Liberty Forever! is a World War I song, performed by The Victor Military Band.

Biography Ibrahim and his brother, Abu'l-Hasan Ahmad, were possibly of Persian origin. Both were distinguished men of letters and rose to prominence at the court of the Abbasids at Samarra. Ibrahim rose to prominence as one of the drinking companions of Caliph al-Mutawakkil (ruled 847‚Äì861). As a result of the Caliph's favour, he became one of the most influential courtiers. His brother Ahmad was also one of the most powerful officials at the time. Vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Khaqan, threatened by the two brothers, caused both to be overthrown and imprisoned in 854/5. Unlike his brother, he remained in prison for several years; it is unknown when he was set free and was appointed tax-collector in Ahwaz. During his tenure there, he was captured by the Zanj rebels. They brought him to Basra and imprisoned him there, but he was able to escape by breaking the prison wall. In 882, he accompanied Caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892) in his attempted flight to join Ahmad ibn Tulun, and was briefly appointed his vizier. At the time of his death in 892/893, he was head of the bureau of the caliphal private domains (dƒ´wƒÅn al-·∏çiyƒÅ ø).

Jeremy \\"Solatrus\\" Iamurri's work on Homestucks music gave him the exposure needed to become a professional musician. After he posted various piano covers on a Homestuck fan forum, Hussie reached out to Toby Fox - who later went on to create the video game Undertale - to produce music for the webcomic's flash animations. The piece \\"Megalovania\\", which Fox initially composed for an EarthBound ROM hack titled The Halloween Hack in 2008, was used in Homestuck as well as Undertale. Fox recounts that he set a goal for himself to get his music featured in the webcomic, predicting the direction the story would take and sending in music that would be relevant in the predicted situations. In an interview with Polygon, Fox said that \\"Over time I kind of established that I 'get' what [Hussie] wants pretty well,\\" which eventually led him to the role of production coordinator for music. Hussie wrote on his Tumblr blog that he never gives artists or musicians context when requesting input, keeping his requests vague by only suggesting a change in tempo or the inclusion of a leitmotif. According to Fox, Hussie creates animations in Homestuck based on the music he receives rather than the other way around. He described this as the most rewarding aspect of creating music for the webcomic: \\"seeing what visuals he creates to go with the audio after imagining your own.\\" The music of Homestuck is published through Hussie's own record label \\"What Pumpkin\\". With the music released on Bandcamp, payment is split between Hussie and the album creators. As the popularity of Homestuck rose, more fans requested to be on the Music Contribution Team; however, Hussie chose to keep the team a fixed size, and closed it to new members. Only team members are legally allowed to profit from Homestuck-related commissions. Fans of Homestuck have created a large amount of filk music based on the webcomic and its soundtrack. Aja Romano of The Huffington Post stated that Homestuck filk music is frequently paired with \\"skilled video editing,\\" producing \\"wondrous results.\\" Reception Harper described Song of Skaia as a \\"cosmically soppy\\" album. Adam Harper of The Fader has described the music of Homestuck as \\"subtly evad[ing] genre, skipping through all kinds of sound worlds, seemingly guided more by emotion ... than form.\\" He pointed at One Year Older and Song of Skaia as oddly mesmerizing albums. Furthermore, Harper described the digitally painted album artwork as \\"bizarre\\" and praised What Pumpkin's \\"weirdly great-looking\\" Bandcamp page. Reid Gacke of Only Single Player rated Toby Fox' \\"Megalovania\\" as one of the best video game songs in 2015, noting that it was initially part of the Homestuck soundtrack before being remastered for Undertale. Gacke has also noted that Homestuck has \\"better video game music than many video games.\\" Discography 30 albums were released on Bandcamp through the What Pumpkin record label, aggregating to 603 total tracks. { width=\\"55%\\" |-  width = \\"43%\\" Title  width = \\"35%\\" Composer  Release |- !scope=\\"row\\"Homestuck Vol. Andrew Huo, Curt Blakeslee, George Buzinkai, Kevin Regamey, Malcolm Brown, Mark Hadley, and Michael Guy Bowman - !scope=\\"row\\"Homestuck Vol. Bill Bolin, David Ko, Gabe Nezovic, George Buzinkai, Michael Guy Bowman, and Robert Blaker - !scope=\\"row\\"Homestuck Vol. Bill Bolin, BurnedKirby, Curt Blakeslee, David Ko, Gabe Nezovic, Malcolm Brown, Michael Guy Bowman, and Nick Smalley - !scope=\\"row\\"Midnight Crew: Drawing Dead Alexander Rosetti, Andrew Huo, Clark \\"Plazmataz\\" Powell, David Ko, Gabe Nezovic, Hilary \\"Pie\\" Troiano, Ian Taylor, Kevin Regamey, Mark Hadley, Michael Guy Bowman, Robert J!
